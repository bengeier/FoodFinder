{"text":"My favorite Thai on the west side! The Tom Yum Kai and Panang Curry are AMAZING! Hint: Get the Panang Curry with Salmon AND Beef!"}
{"text":"Big portions and very tasty food. We will definitely try again. We had the Yellow curry, red curry and the shrimp pineapple curry. All were excellent."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai restaurant!!  Very reasonable  lunch options, every one of them delicious!!  We have also eaten dinner, and had their soups and appetizers...all good, all modestly priced!  The staff here is great...friendly, helpful and fast...we drive across town at least twice a week to enjoy this healthy food!!  For those concerned about spice level, mild is very bland, and they offer several spice levels!  Great place, and also offers take-out and delivery!"}
{"text":"One and Done! This is NOT your restaurant if you expect fresh stir fried Thai food. Our meals tasted like leftovers that had been boiled up again. We ordered 2 different meals with chicken and rice, but when we got our order they seemed like the same meal. Our meals hardly had any chicken and the carrots tasted like boiled stew with onions. NO FRESH INGREDIENTS, the basil sauce tasted like soy sauce with lots of salt.  Service was OK."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim one day before class. I ordered the lunch special yellow curry and I was blown away. Thai is my favorite so I've had a lot of curries but this was by far the best yellow curry I have ever had. If you're in the mood for perfectly balanced, aromatic, sweet, spicy curry, look no further."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with Touch of Thai, but it was still pretty good. I had the tofu red curry. Unlike some other Thai joints in town (namely Thai Basil and Swadee) they deep fry their tofu and then throw it in with the curry sauce and give it a drizzle of coconut milk. Our server was a nice enough guy, but nothing to write home about.   They do have a separate vegetarian menu, but I would prefer that it was incorporated with the regular menu. Also I believe they had something like fish sauce or oyster sauce on the vegetarian menu as well, worries me about what their concept of vegetarian is.  So, it was a  nice enough experience but I don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"I go mainly for the Pad Thai. Love it!! It's zesty! Chicken satay and yellow curry are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Wow, the yellow curry with chicken and potato was so flavorful, rich and creamy. So delicious! I will be back."}
{"text":"I love Thai food. A new client of mine highly recommended the place, and swore this was the best Thai food around, so I agreed to meet him there along with a business associate of mine, who also loves Thai food. My go-to for Thai food is Krachai Thai, but I thought, \"what the heck?\" As soon as I pulled into the parking lot, I groaned. Hubby and I had been here years ago and decided then we would never eat there again, because the food was blahh. I decided to go in with an open mind. \"Hey it's been years,\" I thought. \"Give 'em a try.\" Okay, now I clearly remember why I have not been back. The food was SO Blah. In my opinion, the charm of well prepared Thai food is that all your senses are engaged. It can be so beautifully presented. The aroma of all the spices should tickle your nose. The food should awaken your taste buds. It should be a real pleasure to consume it. None of those things happened here. Service was just okay. We ordered off the lunch menu. Client ordered Pad Thai, I ordered Yellow Curry with Chicken, medium, and business associate ordered Yellow Curry with Chicken, hot. First of all, whatever \"spout\" the water comes out of needs to be cleaned. My associate and I agreed that was some of the worst tasting water we had ever been given in a restaurant. Our orders came out in a timely manner, and they looked okay, even though the curry was a light yellow versus a deep golden color I am used to. Then I took a bite. There was absolutely no spice to it. And worse yet, the curry seemed to be so watered down, there was very little taste to it. I ate about a 1/3 and chose not to eat the rest. I figured why bother simply throwing food down my gullet just because it's there? If I'm not enjoying my food, I stop eating it. My business associate crinkled her nose at me, that's all she had to do to tell me what she thought of it. I tasted hers. Barely any spice to it. Our client enthusiastically chowed down on his Pad Thai. Well, at least one of us enjoyed their meal. Too bad my business associate and I didn't."}
{"text":"I am surprised by all the good reviews, I was very disappointed with the Pad Thai, it was overpriced, small, and did not taste good. I can't comment on the rest of the menu, but there is much better thai in sdale and tempe. Pass this place up."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I haven't been to a place better then this. I get the number 27 which is beef and veggies. Always nice employees and fast service."}
{"text":"great yellow curry and Thai tea here. think this the BEST chicken Satay I have ever had, but its made the traditional way so be prepared to wait awhile for it .  well worth it"}
{"text":"this is the first Thai place I've been to other than a Chinese restaurant that served Thai food. I really enjoyed eating here and would go back.  The waiter & waitress both were friendly, personable and attentive. I would enjoy going back and trying more on their huge menu. I went here awhile ago so can't remember for sure what i got, but it was good - good enough that i took leftovers home and ate them the next day or so.   Not sure if the place was that out of the ordinary (decor or type of food) for tourists or just some co-workers but this group was taking pictures of the food items pictured on the windows and more pictures of the bar area inside??? kinda weird...  Don't go here before 12 on Saturday!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on a weekday. 7:45 PM. I ordered the spicy lemon grass soup (#15) and Pad Thai.  The service was slow. It took forever (20 min) to get our order in (for two ppl)  The soup was served. the 4.95 portion is big enough for two. It was pretty good but not Amazing.  The Pad Thai was pretty good, served in a large portion. I definitely needed a to go box.  I think this is a better lunch place, since they serve warm soup immediately during lunch hours free of charge.  I'll try lunch next time."}
{"text":"My business associates and I have been eating at Touch of Thai for at least 3 years.  Their friendly service and excellent food keep us coming back.  It's a great little restaraunt in North Phoenix.  Give it a try"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!!!  We went there for a farewell party (group of 10) I can imagine the crowd on a friday afternoon.  But what disappointed is the FOOD.. Appetizer - I ordered papaya salad - that came with 1/4 of a cabbage uncut (I dont' think that's appealing)  and also the salad was sooooooooooo tangy I guess they probably made a plate of papaya salad with like liter of lemon or tamarind juice + a pound of garlic arghh..... :(  I've tried papaya salad prior to this..and this one in TofT sucked..  For entree - I ordered silver noodles..the food looked appealing..but the taste was '0' no spices at all..gosh..i can't hate the place enough.. they probably did everything to ruin my love for thai food..  Basically I'm a vegan thai food lover trying out different thai resturants for aobut 5 years now..and this one topped the list of Worst!  Lastly this won't stop me from exploring other thai places in Pheonix. I will write to TofT and see what they have to say..if I find their website or email..  And 2 stars just coz of the servers (guy and a girl) who were very nice and helpful.."}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever! Cool little spot people were nice and food was great. This is my new favorite spot! :)"}
{"text":"This place was alright, just not what I was hoping for. The curry was a little too soupy for my liking. The customer service was great, we had a really nice waitress but unfortunately I don't think that would be enough for me to want to go back."}
{"text":"The food and dessert were yummy and the service was great! When we walked in for dinner, there was no one else in the restaurant. By the time we left, the place was packed! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai place. Great curries and pad Thai. What else is there?  I wouldn't know although I have had a few other items and they are good too but I seem to go back to my old favs."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  I've never even considered getting Thai food before until I was roped into going to this place for lunch with my girlfriend and her parents.   Let me just say I was more than impressed with both the quality of the food and the service.  I will certainly be going back very soon and would highly recommend to anyone I know."}
{"text":"This place is awesome nice layout for dining in, thai art on the wall, looks like ikea lighting but the food is what you want to know about right? Get in here everything I have had in and take out was delicious and they will go thai spicy on you if you can handle it.  I'm talking about lips burning at midnight after you finished eating at 7pm! All the thai staples are great pad thai, the brown sauce noodle.  They have some cool appetizers go see for yourself!"}
{"text":"As I'm Thai, i'll say that this is a very authentic thai restaurant run by a very nice and friendly thai lady. Everything we ordered that day was great. I especially like the creamy red curry chicken. It definitely would be my frequent restaurant if I live in the area."}
{"text":"CLOSED - some damn French Bakery is now in this location. Where will I go for my Thai. I may never recover!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service and food are usually side by side when it comes to quality but today food had the upper hand. - Touch of Thai ...not so touching today.      Today we had a new waiter that has never heard of \"smiling\".  She had a blank serious look during the whole  time.  But that's not that bad right?  So we moved on to order the Pathai noodles, Garlic Chicken (23B), Eggrolls and of course the main attraction Thai Tea.  The food was good as usual but they brought it out 10mns apart starting with the eggrolls.  So when we got the Pathai, well the eggrolls were cold and when we got the Garlic chicken....well the Pathai was cold.  Despite this poorly executed serving tactic the food was still \"ok\" well, as much \"ok\" as half cold food can be.        Towards the end of our meal, we decided to get some more white rice predicting we didn't have enough, our waiter wasn't available, so this is where Lynn (she said that's her name, so it's a maybe) took over and made it that much worse.  We ordered 3 separate entrees so we knew we had at least 1 serving of rice left.  Lynn said no \"with an attitude of course\" and that we had to pay $1 extra for more white rice.  I said ok as our bill was already in the $40s so what's $1.  When Lynn was bringing the rice out I noticed that we still had some left from our first serving so I told her that it wasn't needed anymore.  She did NOT like this and said \"so now I have to throw it away because it's contaminated\"...I was perplexed at this answer O.o ...she continued to say that I had to also pay for it cause she couldn't put it back, supposedly because we \"CONTAMINATED\" it.  Yes, she used the word \"CONTAMINATED\".  I asked but how?...and she said we made the rice container \"dirty\".  It was at that moment that I figured out she used \"THE SAME CONTAINER\" to bring us more rice -_- smh.  The \"dirty\" or \"contaminated\" container as she preferred, was a result from the sauce from the garlic chicken we got.  I just told her, throw it away and charge me for it.  All this drama from Lynn over $1 worth of rice that technically we were supposed to just get as we ordered 3 main entrees.  Also, it was served on the same \"contaminated\" container, I suppose because they just don't want to wash an extra container?...maybe O.o  This could have been a great visit but the lack of customer service and Lynn's attitude made it as the worst experiences of the year(true, this is my worst experience of the year).  As I said at the beginning \"food\" had the upper hand and it might be the only reason for our future return...a far long future from now until memory dicipates this bad after taste service."}
{"text":"Food:  3.5 Service: 2 Summary:  Great lunch joint with a group who enjoys some spicy thai  I've come here twice and both times it took more than 10 minutes for the server to acknowledge our presence, even though there weren't a whole lot of people there.  That said, they're lunch menu is great.  About $9 total for meal, tax, and a 20% tip for some really good food.  I recommend the Red Curry, extra spicy.  Also if you like heat, get some of their extra hot sauce/chili pepper selections.  Definitely a favorite for the work-crowd, so definitely will be coming back for more in the future."}
{"text":"Talk about a diamond in the rough! This place is precariously situated just off of scottsdale road on 4th ave...across from Gilligans. Had I not really looked I may have missed it and I would have been sad because this place is great! My sister and our mutual friend went here last night for dinner and had a really good meal.   The food: I love that they have the ability to vary the spicy-ness of the dishes, and then they also bring out several condiments that can make it even MORE spicy if you like it that way. I tasted my sister's curry, which she ordered spicy. I typically hate spicy food but I thought I should at least give it a whirl. I was pleasantly surprised actually! It had so much flavor and just enough bite for me. I ordered the pad thai with tofu, mild, and it was perfect. I still have some left over :). I also ordered some jasmine tea that was delish and my sister and our friend said the plum sake was a great addition to the meal.   Ambiance: the restaurant itself is small, but they make good use of the space. The bar is situated in the back, and I enjoy the fact that their bar is understated so as to really focus the attention on the food. The restaurant has some cool decorations that give it flair, without going over the top with asian accessories. Tasteful.   Service: there was only one server on the floor, and behind the bar, but given that its a small space he handled it just fine. Quiet, but attentive.   For all three of us to eat and drink our total came to around $50, so it was definitely worth the money spent! We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Their dishes are quite good. My only disappointment was that our server could not speak Thai."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai at a reasonable price. Shrimp summer rolls with peanut sauce are fresh and delicious every time. Best affordable Thai in the valley that I've found so far"}
{"text":"The food was quick and tasty. I had the ginger fish which a whole white pomfret crispy fried and topped with a gingery sauce. Absolutely loved it! Good food and prompt service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food. This was not it. My food was bland and poorly seasoned. The chef obviously did not understand Thai seasoning. The bathroom looked like a someone murdered a turd. The staff was nice and friendly but the overall poor food and dirty conditions will assure that I do not go back. Heavy on onions and missing other must have spices. Egg rolls were greasy and poorly cooked. I ordered two orders and only received one. If you don't have the gas to get to another restaurant than you can survive on the food but you will be depressed you actually spent money on it."}
{"text":"Very good Thai restaurant.  Beef Larb had an amazing flavor, unlike I've had before.  Curry was excellent, and they were generous with the shrimp.  One of the few Thai restaurants that actually provides VERY spicy food if ordered that way.  Fast, friendly service, and wonderful food."}
{"text":"I have eaten lunch here a few times and have not had a bad experience yet. I have yet to eat dinner here but from what I understand it is just as good. The food and service are excellent and their lunch menu is a great value.  The lunch portions are filling but not going to send you back to the office in a food coma. The menu has a nice variety of items and it is all under $10.  So, if you are in Old Town Scottsdale for lunch and in the mood for Thai, this is one of the places to visit. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tonight I was craving some spicy thai food. My husband and I went to this restaurant based on the reviews on yelp(although they aren't great, we wanted to give it a try). We walked in at 9:15pm ie 45mins before closing, so I was expecting decent tasting food but it was a disaster. Tom kha soup was good but the entrees: chilli peppers and spicy mixed vegetables were no where close to \"thai food.\" Needless to say, would never go there again."}
{"text":"I found this place the real Thai taste and authentic cooking style I've experienced in this area. My love dish is the chiken with Thai Basil. It reminded me the flavor I had in Thailand. Their Tom Kha Kai is really good  as well. The combination of the full of chicken meat , coconut soup with Thai herbs is perfect. I think they really know what Thai taste is."}
{"text":"Not the best Thai establishment I've been to, but in the Phoenix area (especially West Valley), we don't have many options.    If you're just looking for a generic pad thai, you'll probably find it to be just fine. There's nothing wrong with that. If you've sampled other various Thai foods and are hoping to find that here, you'll likely be disappointed.   I will return here, but I will continue to stick with the following: Tom Yum Goong and Larb (you can choose your ground meat--I prefer ground pork).  We've had curries and stir-fries, all of which are OK. If you are a Thai purist, avoid the entrees. If you are looking for general Asian-style dishes, Touch of Thai will suffice.   But seriously, try the larb....hidden gem."}
{"text":"I went here with my mother after a recommendation from one of her friends because I had a craving for Thai food. The waitress was very helpful and very fast. Their little black and green lamps are really cute as well. My god though, the exterior of this establishment reeks! It didn't help we were seated right near the front of the restaurant so I always had the faint smell of sewage running in and out of my nose.  I like to base my impression of a Taiwanese establishment on their curry; I LOVE yellow curry and if it's too runny, not enough vegetables, etc. then I'm out of there. I thought their curry was very delicious and it had just the right amount of consistency and spice. My mom had some dish with silver noodles and was also impressed. The only thing that was a little concerning to me was how fast my waitress brought out  the food. Normally that would be a good thing but it took around five or so minutes for her to take our orders in and bring out the food. I couldn't help but feel I received someone's leftovers or some sort of extra food in the back. It was delicious anyway though lol.  I would definitely come back here again if I had a craving for some good food or spicy dishes :)"}
{"text":"Very good food is a little different than most Thai places But very delicious Service was awesome"}
{"text":"Went with some friends for the first time and we all shared our dishes.  Everything was very tasty- I really enjoyed everything.  I will go back here often."}
{"text":"We just walked out. The won tons said they would be stuffed with ground pork, cream cheese, and several other ingredients. We checked every single won ton and there was nothing inside. Just chip. We told them to cancel our entrees. Very disappointed after seeing the good reviews."}
{"text":"After a few weeks of craving red curry chicken, I got my fix at A Touch of Thai.  It was very quiet and my server was very friendly.  The Thai Tea was yummy too!  I will definitely be using this place for the nights of take out and a movie.  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow :-)"}
{"text":"We were very pleasantly surprised by this little place. Scrupulously clean, very pleasant and attentive staff, and delicious food. The portions are more than generous and there are LOTS of vegan options. My husband had the BBQ chicken ANC loved it. It came with a dish of spicy sauce that he said was great. I had veggies and tofu and it was really tasty. You can specify the degree of heat you'd like in the many dishes that include peppers. We will definitely be coming back. Yum!"}
{"text":"First time ordering calamari salad...which had a strong onion (??) flavor and tasted weird...Being raised on Vietnamese food, the strangest of foods has been in my mouth, but I think this falls into the acquired taste category...As in I never acquired a taste for this.  Pad thai was okay...the noodles were a bit over seasoned. I felt like I should've eaten it with rice to tone down the flavor.  Papaya salad was good...still on the look out for that authentic not watered down version, though. Just like my friend's mom makes it! Yum!  Thai omelet. Good.  The people were really friendly as well, which helps, but you KNOW I'm all about the food.  I had takeout and the box for the calamari salad read: \"Carimali Salad\". :) I love it!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The wait staff are very nice. The food is very authentic, especially the beef lap and the chicken soup. I crave this place and often stop by when I have in town. Once of my favorite places and a must when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great fast service. And the red curry with tofu was delectable."}
{"text":"This place really smelled bad, I wouldn't have stayed, however my friend was already eating her soup when I arrived. I did my best to get over the smell, I couldn't eat the soup, I ordered the lunch special red curry. It was really good, not as spicy as I would've liked, but not bad. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Apparently we hit them on a bad night because it was the worst food ever.  I doubt they could have remained open very long if this was the standard (lack of) quality.  I called and ordered an appetizer and two entrees for take out.  When I picked it up, they only handed me one bag.  I got home and opened the cartons and was immediately stunned at how horrible the two entrees looked.  I showed my husband and neither one of us wanted to eat our food.     My deep fried sweet & sour tofu looked more like it had been sitting out in the sun for several days. It was crusty, dried up and hard. My husband's cashew chicken was overcooked and too soupy.  Within less than five minutes, I called and ordered more food from the place we normally order from.  I then called Touch of Thai (to complain) and they mentioned the rest of my order was in another bag.  I told them how horrible the entrees looked and that I wasn't going to return to pick up the rest of my order (the appetizer.)  The entrees went into the trash (wasn't even willing to feed them to our dogs), picked up the order from our regular place and will never, never ever patronize Touch of Thai again.  The very mention of the name makes my stomach turn.  Worst restaurant experience ever."}
{"text":"For almost 10$ each this is the \"lunch special\"that was suppose to come with soup and be only 6.95 according to the website... Well as you can see no soup and we paid way too much for  what we got. This would of been a good 4$ meal. They said the website is old and outdated and the price is now different. what we paid... Food portion is tiny. Very disappointing to say the least. Only saving grace was the Thai yellow chicken curry I got was actually pretty good but only had a couple small chicken pieces and a couple huge pieces of potato that took up most of the small bowl. The egg roll was so small and tasted like a frozen kid meal that got microwaved. There was only 2 wonton chips.. Really guys, 2? Frustrating. We will not be going back. Way to expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"This is great thai food, and the staff is always very friendly and willing to give suggestions.  Take my word for it though, \"hot\" is very spicy!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years.  I just love, love this place.  If you like hot spicy food, then look no further.  They are kid friendly.  They know us by our names.  It's one of my favortie place to eat.  My favorite dish is the Panang chicken.   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service and quality consistently good and tasty. They will sub items no questions asked. Thai has become my favorite Asian good due to this place."}
{"text":"Was ok. Fried rice was good. Wait staff was slow. Atmosphere was a little dated and not kept up. It was clean but needs to be refreshed."}
{"text":"The service sucks!! There is an online menu. Shows their shop. Shows their deco.  Yet when you get their and tell them the price is different and the pictures don't show the exact product, THEN they tell you, \"Oh! That is not our website.\" Then they explain the owner goes on the site to try and up keep it. WHAT IS IT, IS IT YOUR SITE OR NOT????"}
{"text":"I started coming here about 5 years ago and didn't really care for it. But about 3 years ago we tried it again and it was different(obviously in a better way) and I have been frequenting the place ever since. I've tried most things on the menu but the fried tofu and chicken satay are always a good way to start. Check the place out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I tried their tom yum soup, egg rolls and the fresh rolls. Everything was yum. They have a whole section of vegetarian entrees and soups.  Their Thai hot spice level is authentically hot and not the fake hot levels ones you get elsewhere. So just be sure before you decide your spice level ;)  I loved the bold flavors and freshness. They also gave me extra dipping sauce for my rest of the to go box. Customer service is swift. Will surely return to try more."}
{"text":"Touch of Thai used to have a location in old town Scottsdale. I are their pad thai, no joke at least twice a week. I loved their pad thai so much and frequented the place to the point where the owner John knew my name and order. Unfortunately it closed down and just kept their second location open. I now drive 35 minutes to dine here. I wish they would once more open a location in Tempe or Scottsdale. It's so authentic delicious and satisfying I crave it all the time. Highly recommend. However the Scottsdale location was much cleaner than this one. Still trying to find something local and comparable. Thai house is good but just not as good. Love Touch of Thai."}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah the decor is tacky and dated.  But you don't come to Touch of Thai for the sexiness of its appeal, you come here for the food.    $5.95 will get you a complete lunch of Red Curry, soup, wontons and an eggroll.  That's cheaper than Kyoto Bowl!  And yes it's delicious.  The aroma of the red curry is intoxicating, the scent of the coconut milk had my mouth watering before I'd even taken a bite. The flavor is rich and just sweet enough, with the perfect amount of spice for my taste (I ordered mild).  It could have used a few more veggies - there were only 3 green beans in my entire dish.   Not the best Thai food I've ever had, but it was certainly up there.  I would definitely recommend this place for good service, quality food and cheap eats."}
{"text":"Me and a co-worker eat here pretty often, because we loooove there yellow curry. We actually get their yellow curry with broccoli instead of meat and I get their spring rolls. One day I'll be daring enough to eat something new, but my order is sooo good I crave it. Yum!"}
{"text":"Nasty nasty NASTY. Do not waste your money. I ordered pad Thai. The noodles are dry. It seems as if it has been reheated plenty of times. I am sure I'm getting left overs here but can't confirm. The Thai tea is NASTY and bitter. All in all for nearly 20 bucks I could have enjoyed my food"}
{"text":"No jasmine rice? No thanks. Yellow curry was over powered by the taste of coconut milk. Thai ice tea was weak. It has too much milk and not enough tea. It was way too sweet."}
{"text":"Such a horrible location, but it's worth the effort to find it (caddy-corner to giligans). Nice curries, some spicy, but none too killer spicy...somewhat unfortunate. But anyhow, their food is always good, minus the occasional overcooked vegetable miscue. Great for lunch if you're close by and don't want to drop Malee's type cash for similar Thai."}
{"text":"I have never really liked the idea of Thai food. \"Touch Of Thai\" did a wonderful job at changing my opinion. I always get the yellow curry with some spring rolls when ever I go. The food looks just like the picture on the menu unlike other places.  The atmosphere is wonderful, the employees have a radiant glow on their face. The building has enough room for you to feel comfortable and not crammed. When you walk in you get the wonderful smell of what ever they are cooking. The employees are so polite its outstanding that they do not get more praise.  I would recommend this to most anyone I know. If you are looking for a place with great food, wonderful atmosphere, and polite workers come here. The restaurant is more than a \"Touch Of Thai\" is a firm grip of Thai. Overall, great food, wonderful atmosphere, and polite workers, it is a wonderful place to take your family to."}
{"text":"I have nothing to complain about the food quality since food quality here was always great.  Granted, I have been here for 5 to 6 times.  Everytime I was there; they were always short of staff.  You can see many tables except maybe 2 are occupied by customers, but there are only max of 2 servers.  Especially when they are waiting to get their check or sign their credit card receipt, it takes forever for the servers to come.  I feel bad for the servers, and I would suggest Touch of Thai have at least one more server to accomodate the number of customers they have."}
{"text":"I'm normally not a Thai food person but this place changed that today!  Such a delicious lunch! The place looks clean and very modern"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Great selection. Prices are too low.  I normally take home leftovers for a lunch the next day, so cost-wise it's like eating at McDonalds, but taste-wise it's fantastic.  You are probably in disbelief but try this place once.  Note - I just drink water so if you get a beer that will change your cost equation"}
{"text":"Food tasted good...it will always be my best choice of thai bcoz i am vegetarian and they have everything in vegetarian...tried tom yum soup and Red curry....best in this area..."}
{"text":"Touch of Thai has amazing food with fast, friendly service. I recommend going there for lunch. They have great specials."}
{"text":"Touch of Thai is located in a very nondescript stripmall in a very nondescript part of Phoenix. I've eaten here for lunch a few times and if I was going to rate the food, I'd give it more like 3.75 stars because it's tasty and they'll make it real spicy if you want (and yes, I want). Service has also always been great - attentive & friendly.   However, the place smells. I'm serious. You walk in and something is not right. I don't know what it is. You can't say, \"Well, it's a Thai place after all\" because I've been to countless Thai places and none of them smelled like this one. It's not that it's outwardly dirty or anything. Who knows what the deal is, but it takes you about 20 minutes to get used to the smell and by then lunch is half over anyway.   So all in all, food very good. Service very good. Setting is pleasant. Just bring noseplugs until lunch/dinner is right in front of you. I don't know..."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place but the quality and service have gone down drastically! Just got back from there and when you walk in, the place had this stench-y odor that you couldn't escape even when i asked to sit in the very back. the service was slow/lousy and the food was not appetizing. The noodles were very greasy and flavorless for my spicy noodles and overdone with soy sauce in the brown noodles. don't think i'll be going back :(  also, service and food is not consistent since i have gone back a few times after my first review. will need to be finding a new thai place :("}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, especially for Phoenix. You can't go wrong with seafood pad thai or the Thai chili eggplant. They don't charge extra for more rice unlike Krua Thai. The service isn't is as fast as it was when Nick was the manager, but the food is still the same. I don't recommend the Thai Boba tea; it wasn't very good. The boba was really overcooked."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good bit I've had better. Maybe it's what I ordered (yellow curry). I can't say much more because that is all I had this time."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with some friends who had heard good reviews. Our experience: not so much.  We ordered beer, because they had no mint for my mojito. Ordered another cocktail... barely enough for 3 sips. Their imported beer is good.   Food: ordered 4 lunch combos (it's alot of food!) and an appetizer. Three of which came out first before the app; and had to wait an extra 10-15 min for the last entree.... and, unfortunately, found a piece of foil in one of our meals. Other than that: the food is AWESOME!  Service: the waiter did his best. It was only him and who seem to be the manager (who wasn't that very nice)  MAYBE next time!"}
{"text":"The curries are a bit bland, but the spicy beef noodle is out of this world! Plus, they are one of the few thai restaurants who will actually make a dish 'thai spicy'. My face was melting off... it was awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to the Touch of Thai for years. We meet up there at least twice a month for a lunch date. On special occasions we take friends and family there for dinner. I love the wait staff - especially Nick! His wonderful sarcasm and jokes always make our day!   For the amount of food you get at lunch at the price they charge - you can't beat it. Everything is homemade and tastes fresh. #3 Yellow Curry is my hubby's favorite. Rich coconut based sauce with yellow curry. The chicken is tender and the potatoes and carrots are cooked perfectly. I venture off and try things from time to time. The food is spicy. I like the incorporation of fresh herbs into the dishes. The soup served with lunch is always yummy and changes from time to time. We always get a side order of spring rolls. You need to try these! I like the Pad Thai as well as the #5 and #7 lunch specials. Meals are served fairly quickly.   Sometimes we have to get up and refill our own water glasses however I find this to be a wee bit charming. Feels like I am home. If you go there on a regular basis the servers remember you, have your order into the kitchen before you even are seated, and always say hello and smile."}
{"text":"We had never seen this place and were actually driving around the block to park and eat at Jimmy Woo's, serendipity took over and we went here instead. The North side door says \"Welcome\" above it but is locked. Go to the East side entrance to get in. You enter into a sort of courtyard sidewalk. The main restaurant is on the right while there are 2 little tables and 2 benches outside and to the left are 2 overflow rooms that were not being used.  A man brought us drinks after a while, but we sat there for at least 15 more minutes before someone took our order. We were there for lunch. We both got a large bowl of soup that was similar to egg drop. It had the egg white in it and had quite a bite of white pepper. It was piping hot and tasted good.   My hubby ordered the Pad Thai, medium. It was a nice spice level, although he can take it hotter. I tasted it and the noodles were cooked nicely. He enjoyed it. I ordered the Thai Basil chicken mild- I like some spice but not too much. It was not spicy at all. It comes with white rice with black sesame seeds on top which was a nice touch. There is a small green salad with a peanut dressing that was tasty. There was a fried wonton and a small \"eggroll\". One bit of the eggroll was all I was going to eat. It tasted like rancid oil- I was really surprised and disappointed. My main dish had chicken, a lot of bamboo shoots and onion and a few sprigs of basil. It had a nice sauce and was quite tasty. I was enjoying it until about 2/3's of the way through I hit a sharp rib bone! It had been cut so it had a VERY sharp point. Very dangerous!  We had to ask for sauce for the eggrolls and there were no other condiments brought to the table or on the table. I noticed others mentioned that, guess you had a different server. After eatting we waited a very long time for our check. I will say that when I showed him the bone and explained that it was in my food and was dangerous he took my meal off the bill. But, it took about 2 hours to have LUNCH and with the bone and funky eggroll I will absolutely not go back!"}
{"text":"Searched on line and found this little gem! Great service, nice atmosphere and a place that really does serve Thai \"hot\"!! Yum. Had my staple Tom Yum Goon and Red Chicken Curry, huge portions and perfectly made! Did I happen to mention that they served it Thai HOT!! Just delicious!!  Looking forward to visiting them again when next in town."}
{"text":"Just an update- we went there a couple of nights ago. Very busy but the staff was moving as fast as they could and remained friendly as always. The food was excellent.  The waitress with the haircut that goes across her eyes needs to pull it back though. I spent an hour watching her running her hands through her hair as she served food!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Plain steamed rice with green coconut curry is to die for, be prepared for food coma! This isn't on the menu but just ask for it, each dish will come separate so you can add as much rice as you want. Or get the spicy noodles with chicken, I get them mild, then I add some, ok,  A LOT, of the red pepper vinegary  stuff (NOT the red powdery stuff, that'll light you on fire!) that's in one of the little jars that's on the table. Amazing. The red coconut curry and chicken lunch special is super yummy, too. I got mild and I thought it was perfect, just a little kick but not too hot to set your lips aflame. If you like it spicy, go for the medium or hot ;) There are plenty of non-meat items, hence the big Indian crowd at lunch time. The ambience isn't what it's about at Touch of Thai, it's the amazing food! Note: DO NOT sit towards the back or use the restrooms. Funky smells goin' on back there."}
{"text":"I love this place for their yellow curry! Great portions and I'm always left having a BUNCH of leftovers! Recommend to try it if you've never had curry because they over it again a bunch of different levels of spiciness!"}
{"text":"Touch of Thai is a modern restaurant with a small bar and a quiet staff.  If you go here, and you like Thai food, then you will really like the food. It is great! I have had the BBQ and the a few of their curry dishes. All excellent.  But it isn't authentic, it's very modern. My only complaint is the staff speed. It is very close to where I work and you have to be on top of the staff to get your check in time to make it back to work, but it's still a great lunch spot, as they make their food and serve it very quickly.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone who like good food.  Also, the prices are incredible for the food you get!"}
{"text":"Pretty Good Food but Service was pretty bad.  Took us walking up to pay check after waiting 30 minutes to get waitress attention which she never came back.  Do it again, yes but would make sure they know my issue when I order."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, especially for lunch! Love the curry there."}
{"text":"OUR FAVORITE THAI FOOD!!   I love the restaurant, the staff and the food. Stumbled upon this restaurant when I was craving Thai food and I am beyond happy that we did."}
{"text":"Tried the Silver Noodles with chicken & a thai tea. My fiance had the Garlic Pepper Chicken with Pineapple Fried Rice. The food was delicious & the service was fast. Our waiter was courteous and and a very entertaining personality, will definitely cone back here."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, the portions weren't as big as I'm used to... but the heat and flavor were pretty good! Staff is very kind and helpful. I will definitely come back anytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The yellow chicken curry here is to die for! I have yet to find something similar around my area with the same flavorful taste! Same goes for the shrimp fried rice. There was once a misunderstanding with what I ordered but I didn't mind at all because they brought out this awesome lit up (fire in the middle) mushroom soup (not sure what it's called) and it was amazing!!! Everything here just seems to have so much flavor it makes my tummy happy!  The service is usually pretty quick. The staff are friendly. Prices are pretty affordable. I live about 9 miles from here and ALWAYS crave it!"}
{"text":"We tried Touch of Thai for the first time yesterday and we are so glad we did. The food was great, the service was great and as we were pulling out of the parking lot, a waiter chased us down with a lip balm, pack of gum and $20 bill that fell out of my purse. We are fans!  The chicken satay and Gai Thom Khah that we started with were perfect! Just the way I like them. Entree portions were sharing sized so we definitely over ordered and took some home for the kids. We got a red curry and Paht Thai and they were both delicious! The Paht Thai is the red, saucy, sweet kind with chicken, tofu and shrimp which is not my favorite but it was done very well so it was delicious anyway. I don't eat shrimp but my husband said the shrimp were something special!   We will definitely be back to work our way through the rest of the menu.  ETA: I was glad for the review I read that suggested ordering mild even if you like your curry spicy. There was still plenty of kick in the mild!"}
{"text":"I read some reviews before I went here, and some complained of timing, so I clocked 'em. Only took them 5 minutes to bring me chicken #23b, rama garlic and pepper, extra spicy. This is a great dish! Ton of rice served with super spicy chicken in a sauce that is to die for. Quiet place, easy eating, friendly people, my kinda place!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you want to be like those guys in the circus. You know...those guys that eat fire. Except fire doesn't really have taste...so one night I went with something better than fire...Pad Thai at Touch of Thai.  It was a rainy friday, and I was Jonesin for some Thai. I have a special place in my heart for the Thai. If you've ever worked with me, you'll know why.   I hopped on Yelp and found this place. I was NOT disappointed. Parking was a bit of a bitch, but I took this to go. NBD.  I ordered Pad Thai (extra spicy -- a nine). My nose was running more than a marathoner at the 26 mile marker sprinting towards the finish line. It was a rush of flavor that is not possible to describe in any Yelp review.   The owner/guy that is always there is very nice and friendly. Everytime I go in there, he seems to forget who I am. He asks \"Have you had Thai food before?\" And I have to remind him that I am no amateur.   To answer Christian Bale's question....I AM A PROFESSIONAL!  If you love Thai food and you are a professional....grab some grub at Touch of Thai. It's the jam."}
{"text":"They'd been heading downhill; And have arrived. MSG intensive; flavors indistinctive. And the sad, Great Depression edition soup comprised of celery and cabbage that comes w lunch."}
{"text":"I LOVE Touch of Thai! I eat here any chance I get & I've never been disappointed with their vegetarian dishes. I haven't tried a lot of their veggie selection, but as for now my absolute favorite is #69 - Tofu Curry. Mmm mmm! I am also a huge fan of their Pad Thai and their Thai Iced Tea. Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Was hungry after an intense match of tennis and want to have nice, tasty and filling dinner, headed straight to this place and order red curry with chicken, was really delicious. Will definitely recommend this place..!!!  Can't wait to take wifey and kiddo to this place."}
{"text":"If you are Muslim or vegetarian, avoid this restaurant. We ordered yellow shrimp curry. First time they messed up and gave chicken shrimp curry. When we pointed this they replaced it. Even in this replacement dish, we found a chicken piece. This despite our strict instructions for a vegetarian base for all our dishes. We are not going to visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Solid Thai food in North Phoenix.  The portions were a little on the small side, but we got $6 lunch specials that came with an egg roll and fried wontons, so it's likely that the dinner orders are a bit more generous.  I had a chicken red curry ordered Thai hot and was happy that they were actually willing to make it hot for me.  Too many Thai places won't actually make their food hot, although I've found that the magic words \"I promise I won't send it back\" go a long way when ordering.  When the server brought out my dish he said that they made it \"diarrhea hot,\" which took me by surprise as diarrhea is a word that a server should never, ever say.  I was unfazed though, and ended up eating a delicious curry that had a good amount of spice to it.  The restaurant itself is large, open, and comfortable, and the food is good."}
{"text":"It was my frst thai food experience. Foods were really good.we ten friends went over there and ordered so many items.we took chicken and mushroom soup, fish fillet, lo mein noodle, shrimp fried rice,chilli fish, garlic and pepper chicken, cashew chicken etc.we couldn't able to order dessert as kitchen was already closed.we had to ask for our water, spoon, plates etc.i think they went a little nervous as they had to take order from 10 people at at a time."}
{"text":"I've been to Touch of Thai twice now and ordered the Sweet & Sour dish with crispy chicken and both times was super impressed. The sauce is REALLY good and the portion is well sized. I also tried the fried rice with tofu this time and was in absolute heaven!  The decor isn't too great, kind of just plain and the bathroom wasn't very impressive, but the quality of food and extremely friendly staff make this a 4 star kind of place in my book. Our waiter was incredibly friendly and helpful in making recommendations.   I will definitely continue to eat here when I'm looking for a Thai fix!!"}
{"text":"I love thai food , it is my favorite, and this place has some hits and misses. I think some of the prices are a little high, and the rice portions are so small that  I Always ask for more.But I love the soup, and I usually order that."}
{"text":"The khai thom gai (im pretty sure i botched that spelling) number 18 on the menu was everything I hoped for. Served with a live burner in the middle to keep the soup hot which also makes heads turn wondering \"what is that I want that too.\" This soup consists of Coconut, Lime, Lemongrass, Chicken, Mushroom, some other stuff I dont know but its all Superb! You can select your level of hotness (mild, medium, or hot). My wife had the Green Curry. I sampled her curry in which I found it  sweeter compared to the #18 that I chose which was also extremely good and also came with rice. Im defintely going back for seconds. Oh yea, the waiter is very pleasant with the right amount of attentiveness."}
{"text":"Another Phoenix gem hidden in a strip mall...  Touch of Thai has an extensive menu that includes beef, chicken, pork, seafood, and dedicated vegetarian sections.  Since I was a bit overwhelmed with all of the choices, I let our wonderful server, Nick, choose for me -- on two separate occasions.  I indicated that I wanted something spicy-hot, a thick gravy/sauce, and some vegetables.  One time he selected a delectable red curried vegetable beef plate, the other was a yellow penang curried salmon platter.  Without fail, each plate was skillfully prepared, spiced to my preference, extremely tasty, and served with a smile.  I enjoy the communal rice that comes with most menu selections, the five or so spices that are brought to the side of each table, and the relaxed atmosphere.  I noticed one reviewer comment that some of the dishes are simple variations on Chinese fare.  Although all of the dishes had their Thai names listed next to them, there might be some truth to that criticism.  But in the end, so what -- you can't go wrong.  And as I type this review, I'm starting to think that I'm going to make it an early lunch there today.  PROS: Everything tastes (so damn) good Large menu (something for everyone) Nick (a very nice and extremely helpful server) Rather inexpensive Laid back and casual atmosphere  CONS: When it gets crowded, you'll be waiting (as it seems to be understaffed) Some menu items seem to be more Chinese than Thai (but good nonetheless, so I don't really know if that's a true con)"}
{"text":"Touch of Thai is probably the best I've found so far in the Valley.  Satay is the ultimate gauge of a Thai restaurant IMHO, if your satay sucks you've just tarnished my opinion of your entire establishment.  Is it fair?  Maybe so, maybe not but I got my standards!! Theirs is pretty good, their noodle dishes (pad see u, pad kee mau, etc,) are also good choices.  I am a big fan of spicy food and their menu does not disappoint in that regard when I specify that I like it HOT!!! Have fun!  And a Singha!"}
{"text":"Nice place!! LOVED thai iced tea!!!!"}
{"text":"i  went to there for dinner tonight around 7pm.there was only 2tables dine in.i went to restroom wash my hand ehkkkkkkkkl...restroom smells terrible! !! i have never. went to a restaurant there restroom smells like that.... i ordered chow mein and i did not like it .lots of vegs very lite noodles.serivce was nicein the beigning untill i asked for extra sauce to go and the lady who wear the flower on her hair gets upset she looks like i amvery annoying and went back to kitchen said something in thai.thats not nice at all.i mean really? i also ored food to go too.my bill was 27.17 so is it really big deal when i asked extra sauce?you can charge me if yoi want to but come on just dont be rude. also i ordered summer roll to go too.its definitely different than other thai restaurant they actually wrap a huge lettuce make it looks bigger but it smells sooooooooo bad.they were very expensive like almost$8 i like thai food and tried so many place but i had to say this was the worst thai food i have ever had the price is very high qulity is low.this my first time visit it seems this is also last time!"}
{"text":"Yes please.  Just order the chicken satay and tom yum and split it with someone. Great lunch or dinner at a reasonable price.  Wait staff is very friendly and the restaurant is nice and clean. Such a nice little place in this older north neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been going here for the last couple of years until I found out about \"Line Thai\" a little more West on 98th Ave and Bell Rd.   At \"Touch of Thai\" they have great lunch specials which comes with soup and rice. The entrees  are good as well and priced regularly. My favorite dishes at this Thai place are their Pad See Ew dishes (the flat noodles). For the rest of their dishes, I'm not sure how to explain it other than the spice combination as not being nearly as dynamic or flavorful as \"Line Thai's.\" Perhaps the other place is more authentic? The prices are the same at both places but they do have a wider selection of desserts here which is a plus."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go to for some excellent pad thai. I order it thai hot because I am a glutton for punishment. Even with the extra spice it has great flavor and it is a huge portion. The sweet and sour chicken and egg rolls are also very good."}
{"text":"As we parked the car, my bf said, \"I hope there's room.\" I was like well it's Saturday lunch time...it should be pretty busy if this is a four stars yelp place. But I didn't see too many cars parked outside so I wasn't really sure. The restaurant kinda looked like a house..I've noticed quite a hand full of Thai restaurants that resembles either a house or a temple...and this one really looks like a house. Scottsdale is somewhat a quiet city I suppose since I am very use to the crowds on the streets of LA on a hot summer Saturday afternoon...but here I guess it's too hot to be venturing on the street. ANYWAYS...before I go off topic again......  So we opened the slightly heavy wooden door and to my \"surprise\" there was absolutely not a single soul in sight. It was so quiet I could hear the crickets chirping...Even the waiter looked kinda surprised when we walked in...he might have been thinking \"omg we have customers!.\"   So to be fair I can't judge the service...it wasn't like they were at all busy...for like hour that we sat there only one guy came in to eat...and I believe he might have been a regular since he was chatting with the waiter.  The food is so-so. I had the Drunken Noodles with Beef...SoOo I said I wanted mild spicy...NOT NON-SPICY. But it turned out to be NON-SPICY and kinda overwhelmingly salty. It was hot out of the wok but did not have a hint of spiciness to it. I'm pretty sure mild in the level of spiciness means it's still has a little spiciness to it and not totally not spicy....but whenever I order something that's suppose to be spicy and I say mild...they bring me something that's totally not spicy. =/ I find that frustrating because I can't take medium spicy in Thai restaurants...it's like eating fire for the medium I don't want to know how it feels like to eat hot. Sooo I want mild!    Well anyways my bf ordered the Chicken Basil with rice. Chunks of white meat chicken...not to my liking...don't really like white meat chicken but the flavor was also lacking. not really impressed with this place and therefore not sure if i wanna come back the next time...the prices were pretty high too...the waiter told me there's no lunch special so the regular price of my Drunken Noodle dish was like 12 bucks. -_-"}
{"text":"I go out to eat for lunch only a few times a month so I am always looking to try something new and close by. Touch of Thai is within walking distance of my salon so I wanted to give it a try. For less than $10 I got enough food for 2 meals which is awesome in my book. The cabbage and sprout soup that comes with the lunch special was a generous portion, would have actually been enough on its own. The broth was light and pungent while the sprouts and cabbage had the perfect consistency of soft but not soggy. I ordered the yellow curry chicken, my go to favorite Thai dish. The portions again were generous, the chicken was tender, the carrots crisp and the potatoes melt in your mouth. There was just enough kick to make my nose run. The salad had a nutty dressing that I almost asked for a side of to dip my won ton and mini egg roll in.  It is on my list of lunch places in Old Town. I can't wait for the weather to get cooler so I can walk over in a warm sweater and try some of their soups!"}
{"text":"First time going here and overall everything was good. We did the vegetarian vegetable appetizer, the tofu curry and the tofu spicy noodles. The only thing we really didn't enjoy was their tofu. The tofu with the appetizer was extremely plain but the rest of the plate was delicious. The tofu in the meals had a strange texture but we still plan on going back and trying out a couple other dishes."}
{"text":"We are from out of town, found a Thai restaurant with 3.5 star didn't think it could go wrong. BUT we were wrong, the food tasted terrible.  Fried wonton was dry with no cream cheese taste like fried chips, pad see ew was also dry and too sweet, fried rice has no eggs in it. All this was over $50, wish we could have gotten our money back!"}
{"text":"Good: I love their noodles and fried rice. One of my favorite Fried rice places!  Bad: The smell, when you walk inside, you're greeted by this odd bathroom stench because the hostess welcomes you. The smell would only linger around the back few tables (near the rest room) but over the years, the bathroom smell has gotten worse and worse. Now the smell practically asks you were you wanted to be seated.  Someone call the plumber! XP  Conclusion: Place still had good food, and I love how they have awesome channels on TV most of the time. Once they fix the smell, I'd bump up it a star or 2."}
{"text":"Not so good. Always subpar food. I've tried it a few times and never really left loving it."}
{"text":"This place is great for dine in or take out. Great service and food."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials and the food is very good, but we saw a cockroach here on the wall more then once.   Very common in the valley, so we still eat here we just call it\" cockroach Thai!\" Like: \"Who is up for Cockroach Thai for lunch today!!!?\" The Pad Thai is not very good get the Curry."}
{"text":"While it is true that Touch of Thai is nothing special to look at, the food more then makes up for it!  Actually, I always get mine to-go.  The Panang and Red Curry are soooo good that I never get anything else.  I'm a curry fan in general and this place has the best. It is very creamy with lots of coconut milk and they can make it as spicy as you want- so beware!  I do wish that they had brown rice and would put a few more veggies in their curries, but otherwise the flavor is right on!        I recently went to Hong Kong and had some amazing Red Curry and was a little sad that I would probably never get to taste it as good again, but this place saved the day!  Yeah, I get a little too excited about curry.       Lastly, in my experience this restaurant doesn't have any sort of odd smell like another reviewer suggested."}
{"text":"\"It's your birthday, where would you like to go?\"  Touch of Thai-much to my surprise and delight. The P had spoken so off we went. Delightful dinner, I had the red curry and The P had the yellow curry-both ordered Hot but not Thai hot. Flavor for both was excellent. We also had shrimp spring rolls which was a terrific bargain, very generous portions. They have a very limited wine selection which was kind of a bummer for The P but she made due.  This is the first time I've been here for dinner and was impressed.   I've need here for lunch at least a dozen times and think its one of the best lunch places in the NW Valley. Great lunch specials and they always get you in and out quickly.   Very reasonably priced, one of my co-workers called me a cheap bastard for bringing The P here for her birthday, yes, two entrees, one app, a glass of wine all for under $35.  Had enough to stop for Fro-Yo on the way home."}
{"text":"Food tastes good, Portion of each entree is big ( 2 people can generously have a single curry item), decorations are simple and good, the restaurant is not very clean, service was quick and staffs were courteous. Me and my husband ordered a wonton soup, panang curry and a chowmein noodle. I will surely recomend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago. Started off with some really good fresh and crispy Fried Wontons, then for dinner We got the Seeet and Sour Chicken and Pad Thai. I have to say it was all very delicious!! That was our first time trying Pad Thai, we were scared, but it was excellent!! We will be back. And the staff was not overly friendly but they were nice. We sat at the bar. Cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via Uber Eats. Line Thai is always our go to...until today.  Ordered the egg rolls, still crispy at delivery (25mins) as well as the Satay. Both were fresh and not overlooked. Sauces were delish. I got Pad Thai, noted all chicken in order and was prepared as requested. Hubs got red curry. The flavors were on spot. Wish they had a dessert section on UE. Total was $44 and tipped $6. Worth it. Hit the spot."}
{"text":"This place has real great food and great service. Reasonably priced and lunch/dinner portions are reasonable too. It's not a fancy place but would definitely recommend if you are in Phoenix area for good Thai food."}
{"text":"Used to have a 4 stars with me. Not no more. I have made two visits since my last review and each was was worse than the last.  My last visit  was a to-go order.   Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice, Summer rolls and combo appetizer.   Pad Thai was good. Not outstanding, but I did not feel cheated.  Combo platter was good, just overpriced for what you get.  The Pineapple Rice had NO pineapple in it. NONE.  Really? Who misses the ingredient that the dish is named after? Seriously?  I got my answer... The same one who made the summer rolls. There was way too much thai basil in them. It was like eating a bouquet of flowers. This is why I opened them up and found the lettuce. The lettuce inside was the thickest nastiest white part that was all oxidized. To the trash with them.  There are too many options that are just a little further away...but worth the drive.  Original review.. I have been here three times over the last couple of years.  The first two times were 5 starts easy. I seek out Thai when I travel and this is one of the better Thai places when I am home.  We tried the following items. Duck - I cannot remember the exact dish, but it was not the Crispy Duck. It was just OK. I like duck, but not this dish in particular. I would NOT order this dish again. Others liked it, so don;t take my word for it. My buddy and I each ordered the red curry chicken. I went with Medium and he with the  Hot. The hotness was just right and they have the Thai chili peppers and various hot sauces to add more. Mu only complaint was the green beans were very \"woody\". Not canned, but too old and they lost their freshness and were like chewing on Lincoln Logs (remember those?). I would have preferred they left them out because the rest of the dish was excellent. Because they were included they affected the rating. The Chicken Satay which was moist and full of flavor. The Summer Rolls with Shrimp were very good. Lots of fresh veggies and wrapped in rice paper with the accompanying sauces. Though there could have used more shrimp.  We went on Saturday early evening and they were not very busy. Scary on a Saturday night, but it was good.  The service was excellent and the waitress was very helpful and she explained where explanation was needed.  I will go back."}
{"text":"delicious thai food...and its in arizona!  i was a little doubtful when friends told me it is good.  ordered pad thai w tofu, pad see ew, and pineapple fried rice.  these definitely have that \"wokness\" in them, which makes them good in terms of chinese cuisine.  can feel the heat and flavors swirl in your mouth! yums"}
{"text":"Ordered Pad See Ew through UberEats, the flavor was definitely lacking, pretty greasy and the noodles were a bit overdone. We each tired the beef but since it was tough & fatty I would try the chicken if we decide to order from here again. It wasn't the worst I've had but I've definitely had much better flavor. There was also minimal egg which was disappointing."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome, we had every last bite of it. i am giving this place full 5 star  for the taste of the food. i usually don like curry but this place made real good ones. its easily affordable and the service is really good too. i would surely suggest this place for anybody who wants to have good thai food."}
{"text":"Make sure to seat with nick! He is by far the best and always remembers my order!! Love the sweet and sour chicken. It's phenomenal"}
{"text":"i would rate the food here at five stars, some of the best thai food i've ever had.  the problems are the atmosphere of the place. run down strip mall space with lime green and pink interior decoration from what i remember best left in the 80s.  as another reviewer said, they don't screw around with spice. if you ask for it very spicey you better watch yourself."}
{"text":"The food is sooo good I had the chili lover with chicken and #18 coconut chicken curry soup so good and I love it spicy"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night (Sunday), slower than usual, which was nice. Service was great and the food was even better. Highly recommend the hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"Been going here for months--take out only.  Always consistently delicious, great service.  WHy bother with Malees?  This place is soooooo much better.  I am stuck on Penang Curry with chicken--thai hot!  So many places when you ask for hot, you get not! Please give this place a try--they seem to be slow for the summer."}
{"text":"A touch of Thai? Seems more like a full-grope fondle if you ask me since they serve nothing but Thai food at this strip mall restaurant off Bell Road in north Phoenix. I sometimes come down to our office down here for meetings, and since I have a reputation for being a San Francisco foodie, i.e., snob, they fret over where to take me for lunch. I've been driven here twice now, and I have to say the Thai food is solid stuff in the journeyman way it's prepared. Gee, that did sound like a snot wrote that, didn't it? I can't deny who I am, can I?  Anyhow, I've always been here during the all-important lunch hour from 11AM to 2:30PM to take advantage of the Lunch Special menu. After all, each special is \"served with soup, eggroll and fried wonton\" (photo: http://bit.ly/2nYn8U9). What more do you want in the sweltering heat of Phoenix? First came the Thai Cabbage Soup, a hearty cupful of chicken broth, shredded cabbage and sliced celery that reminded me more of Dublin than Bangkok save for the aggressive dousing of Thai chile sauce I gave it (photo: http://bit.ly/2mGcz80).   My entree was the Gang Ga-Ree Gai, the classic Thai yellow curry dish with chicken, carrots, and potatoes (photo: http://bit.ly/2nlBA5y). The base of the dish is the spicy coconut milk that appeared to have thickened to a stew-like consistency from the potatoes in particular. It was a milder curry than most, probably a good thing since I was boarding a flight in a couple of hours and don't need to be a belching machine in coach. The scoop of rice was essential, the egg roll and fried won ton far less so. Still I'd come back for another touch of Thai as long as I'm not molested.  FOOD - 3 stars...good Thai yellow curry that has the basics right, the rest needs work AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...definitely enough room SERVICE - 3.5 stars...they moved quickly and without intrusion TOTAL - 3 stars...the curry is worth getting here"}
{"text":"It was a dreary cold and rainy day....  Ok, well maybe not, this is Arizona.  I was absolutely starving at work and craving some GOOD Thai.  I headed over to Touch of Thai because the reviews were fantastic.  For an appetizer I tried the Crispy noodle. I've had it at other places and have liked it. You really cannot mess it up and Touch of Thai didn't. Don't expect a lot of meat on it though but the one or two pieces of shrimp and port were very good. I love the crispy noodle because it's sweet and reminds me of rice crispy treats. Add a little soy sauce to it and you got yourself a sweet and salty treat!  I also ordered the Red Curry with chicken for my entree. It was very good and filling. I tried the medium heat and I'm thankful I didn't go with hot because, ouch, it was hot enough at medium!  The chicken was great, wasn't dry and there was plenty of it. The carrots, green beans and bamboo shoots were fresh and crispy instead of all mushy like I've experienced at other places.  Very good.   The waiter was great! Very friendly and attentive. Wasn't hard to be attentive since I was in the door right as they opened for the day and was his only customer....bonus!   If you're around this area and want some good curry, head on over to Touch of Thai, for sure."}
{"text":"Just shoot me.  A Touch of Thai is just that: \"a TOUCH of Thai\" :)  I haven't tasted such below average Thai food before.  Go to Siam Thai not far from here, but sooo much better: http://feastinginphoenix.com/?p=289  Siam Thai has more authentic taste than Thai restaurants I'm used to eating at in Phoenix.  Their Phad Kee Mao is wonderful, by the way.  They're at 5008 W. Northern Ave, Glendale, AZ 85301.  Open Tues-Sun.  Go--you won't be disappointed.  Tell me what you think after you go."}
{"text":"I have not been to many Thai food restaurants in Phoenix but of all the ones I have eaten at, this is by far the best and it's so close to home! Always friendly staff, good food and food service. Will continue to go for years"}
{"text":"Uuuuaaaaaaaaaaahhhhggggggggllllaahhhh (that's my puking sound). While I didn't actually puke, I'm very surprised.   It was a typical Thursday night where neither of us (*cough* James *cough*) could make a decision on where we should eat. So while driving aimlessly down the road in every which direction, we pulled up Yelp and went to the closest Thai restaurant with solid reviews.   We sat down and both of our noses turned up wondering what that smell was. James proclaimed \"it smells like a bathroom in here\" I, however, couldn't smell what he was smelling....YET. All I could smell was cleaning products, like too many combinations of chemicals that make you wonder if someone is laying in the back passed out. I could smell bleach and something that smelled like a lavender scented ammonia.   I don't know why we stayed, maybe it was the hunger pains. Maybe it was laziness, but I regret that decision.   I ordered Hot and Sour soup and Egg Rolls.   The soup wasn't good, it was chicken broth with cayenne pepper dumped in. Some bland chicken and some uncooked mushrooms (straight from the package). James kept telling me to move my soup back because he thought it smelled like dirty feet, although I'm not sure how he could smell that over the bathroom stench.   The egg rolls were better but very greasy, I did like the inside however.   At some point in our meal, I finally got the whiff from the bathroom. OMG. I'm done eating, can we just go??  We thought it was a one time thing, maybe the line cook had some nasty Taco Bell for lunch, maybe their plunger broke, but after reading the reviews, this has been happening for months. Get a damn plumber out there or shut your doors.   NASTY!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Thai food in Scottsdale.  It is located downtown and has lots of free parking right out front.  I have been there three times (once for lunch and twice for dinner) and each time I try something different.  So far I have not been disappointed.  It is a small place but is nicely decorated.  It has a full bar and you can sit at the bar if you wish.  Today I had Chang beer (from Thailand) for the first time and it was great.  Very friendly people that speak good English.  Definitely worth the drive from anywhere in the area if you are looking for great Thai food."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and I was very pleased. First, the place is clean and the service is VERY attentive and friendly. I ordered egg rolls which were large and a good price, 2/$3. I then ordered the Phad Thai (no tofu) which was also a good portion and very tasty. Note: the picture of the noodle dish was after I had put a good portion on my plate. All food was served piping hot and my water was filled up three times. I will definitely be back. Good experience here!"}
{"text":"I called in for a takeout order of Shrimp Pad Thai for lunch while I was at work. I was surprised it wasn't on the lunch menu, but I ordered it anyway ($13). They said it would be ready in 10 minutes and by the time I got there (less than 10 minute drive) it was ready. I set my expectations low and it was surprisingly tasty. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here with friends after a long day of shopping. It's on the Southwest Rapid Rewards Dining list, so we decided to give it a shot.  Parking in Scottsdale has always been a hassle, but we were lucky to get a parking spot close to the restaurant after circling around a few times.   There was only one waiter at the restaurant, and he was WONDERFUL. The three of us all ordered Pad Thai. It came with 5 or 6 pieces of big succulent shrimp, and TONS of chicken. The portion was very large, but since I was starving I finished the whole thing. My friends like their Pad Thai on the spicy side and they were pleased that the waiter gave them a scale of 1-5 with Tabasco as a reference point of  3. It allowed them to get a good idea of how spicy their food would be.  We asked for extra peanuts, and the waiter came by with a side dish full of freshly chopped roasted peanuts. We also asked for extra lime, and he cut up 2-3 limes for us. He topped off our waters without us asking. All of this great service amongst several patrons, including one individual at a nearby table who was extremely demanding and indecisive. Major props to the waiter and excellent/generous chef."}
{"text":"zero stars.    sat at a booth with the DIRTIEST walls next to us.  looked like someone threw food on it and it was never cleaned.  plates on the table were filthy.  the food that we tried was terrible.  i got the phang chicken and there were actually THREE little pieces of chicken (not even a full bite) in it.  The curry sauce was not good at all.  the other person in the party got the pepper beef.  it was awful too.  no flavor, the mushrooms were still dried out and it tasted bad.  the 'really good wine' they advertise was bad.  tasted like vinegar.  with all the good restaurants around...we won't be back."}
{"text":"True story: I'd never had Thai food before, so a coworker brought me here for lunch one day. It was soooo good that I brought my husband back for dinner the SAME day!!   This place has genuinely friendly and welcoming service, and the food... ugh, the food. You are highly likely to eat too much, because it's so good you just can't help yourself.   They have a terrific flavor profile in all of their house entrees that is just... deeply spicy in the flavorful way, not just the hot way. Don't get me wrong - the medium and ESPECIALLY the hot varieties of sauce truly bring the heat - but they are much more than hot just for the sake of being hot. The sauces are rich and layered in their flavors.   I've tried several of the house dishes and they are all just delicious. I can't pronounce a single one of them but the #25... Hell. Yeah. That's my number, man. My husband has loved any of the curry dishes that he's tried.   All dishes come with your choice of meat and your choice of mild, medium, or hot, so you really get a customized dish every time.   The crispy noodles and the satay on the appetizer menu are both outstanding as well.   I can't find a single thing I'd change about this place. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm over in the west valley, this is my spot for Thai food. Clean, bright, and comfortable atmosphere. Friendly, vivacious staff. Reliably good food. Great curries and pad thai.  Seafood dishes are also a highlight."}
{"text":"This is my mom's favorite Thai place. Food and service were great. Only downside is that the place isn't that clean. The booth we sat at was against a wall that seemed covered in different foods and sauces.   If you ignore the walls, you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite spot!!! I'm so excited to try everything on this menu! Everything I have tried so far I can't get enough of, so its hard to move on to the next item on the menu the next time I go! Because my pallet can't get enough of the dishes I ate previously!! Very fast service! My mouth is salivating just thinking about this place!"}
{"text":"Went three times and never going back. So my boyfriend and I LOVE Thai food and he recommended this place. On all three occasions once we started ordering I realized that whenever I asked for something, like chopsticks, napkins... a spoon.. the female waitresses, just like the male waiter wouldn't look at me or converse with me but to my boyfriend. As if he was my ruler and/or decision maker. For everything! We found it extremely low, disrespectful and culturally insulting. Not to mention, the waiters are super rude and some of the vegetables in the curry were totally spoiled. And the restaurant smelled bad! Like sewage and poop.  It's like this... Clean the restaurant, don't serve people spoiled food.. and have some dignity and respect!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai place I have been to. The service is always great the portions are big and the prices are reasonable. I'm a vegetarian so everytime i come here I get a tofu dish with their egg rolls.  I can't put my finger on what it is but everytime I come here I get sick but I always go back for more thats how good their food is."}
{"text":"Searching yelp for Thai, I found TOT. Walked in and noticed a lot of Asian Indian groups, usually a sign of good Thai food at especially low prices.  I ordered a bowl of Tom Yum Goong ($4.95) and Phat Grapao with rice ($8.95) - I selected spicey for both.  Tasty soup, lots of big shrimp, lemon grass, galanga and mushrooms.  The grapao came quickly and I hadn't had time to finish the very warm soup so I set it off to the side.  The jasmine rice had a hint of light sweetness (normal) and made a nice contrast to the veggies and chicken in the grapao.  I enjoyed the meal and service was fast, prompt and polite - would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Touch of thai makes the best shrimp red curry with pineapple and pad thai! Here for the food not the ambiance. It's always pretty quiet and I'm okay with that!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I ordered the pad Thai, curry Thai chicken, and sweet and sour chicken. I also made it medium hot since I like my food on the spicier side. Service was pretty fast, and friendly minus the accent/a few translation explanations. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I have had a lot of times here and they were pretty good! Today has been the worst... Yes, we came in at closing - that doesn't mean they compromise on their quality! Krachai Thai on 35th and bell is just awesome and I love going there!"}
{"text":"Man this first review is odd.  I didn't find it to be \"smelling weird.\"  Alright, man.  That's cool.  Anyway, this is a good place for the dinner thai crowd.  It's a solid 4 star place.    Everyone is friendly.  They refill your water with urgency (especially if you're making faces due to unexpectedly hot food).  The food is well done and nicely presented.  A good place that I frequented often as it was nearby."}
{"text":"Good, quick, reasonably priced Thai food on the west side of Phoenix.  It's pretty much what you'd expect from a thai restaurant.  Service is nice, food is pretty standard Thai with all the classics.  This restaurant is more of a convenience factor for me than anything, but if you live on the west side and crave Thai food then you could definitely do worse."}
{"text":"I feel like a commercial saying it, but Grand Opening is tomorrow! Just wanted to spread the word, this place is also located in the West valley...it's amazing! Along with the usual Thai favorites, this place also has about 20 different vegetarian dishes to delight ALL tastebuds! They usually have lunch specials for under $10 from 11am-3pm. Other than that, bring your exotic appetite and gin tii ni! (eat here) commonly used as in 'for here' :D"}
{"text":"By far, the best Thai food I have ever had. I love the reaction I get when I order it spicy and they ask how spicy and I tell them, as spicy as you can make it.   I love their squid and other more exotic foods, but the chicken is always cooked perfectly as well. I have tried a sauteed tofu dish that was really yummy when I am in the mood for something lighter.   I work nearby, so on occasion, get to sneak out to go to lunch. And it is worth it. Amazing, yummy food, delightful service, and a great little place. The decor is a bit out dated, but Im okay with that. It doesn't distract me from the wonderful aroma when you walk in to the zesty, savory, flavors of their cuisine. I recommend them to everyone!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place a lot. I have noticed the food has gone down hill, but the worst thing is, the last 2 times I've been there... COCKROACHES! I feel bad writing such things, but come on! Get an exterminator! It's disgusting and disrespectful to your patrons to not do something about roaches.  Baby ones crawling up the walls too.... Icky!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a group from work this week... We like the food but this time service was kind of... odd... We miss Nick (Oh well, I do)  We got the soup and no rice... we had to ask for it. -Are we the only ones that like our coconut soup with rice? : P We got the main dish (we always do family style) and we didn't have the plates : ( We asked for spicy and it was so-so... I guess we need to ask for extra super spicy next time : )  Food was really good as usual, we had the coconut soup, yellow chicken curry, cashew chicken and catfish... delicious!"}
{"text":"this was my first time to try this place. im from the bay area, california & i come to arizona whenever my dad has to come to work here.   my dad's coworkers took us to this place for lunch earlier today. i thought it was gonna be super good. especially hearing from them that they absolutely love this place.  the service was really great. our food came out really quick. i felt a little cramped eating tho. the booth we were sitting in was really tight. i thought the table was way tooooo close to me.  we ordered the pineapple fried rice. it was really good but i feel like it could of been better. we also had pad thai. didnt like it too much. it had no kind of flavor to it. ive had way better back at home. but this restaurant is really nice. very modern decor. nice area. i gave it 3 stars.. pad thai needs more flavor to it and seats need to be more spacey."}
{"text":"The coconut curry soup is phenomenal! And the pork wonton soup. This is a cute little place. You kinda forget your in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Have ordered the pad Thai from here a few times. Every time it's exactly how i ordered it and tastes delicious. Just wish portions were bigger !"}
{"text":"This is a good place for lunch.  I enjoy the food, very well prepared.  Not a very fancy place, probably a lot of fun for a pre-going out launching place.  Get some spicy food in you, drink some martinis, then hit the town for the night."}
{"text":"So before I start my review, I'd like let Yelp know that I don't appreciate my Thai Lahna review disappearing. Where is it Yelp? I just went to the Thai Lahna business page and I know FOR A FACT I left them one review AND one review update and a CTRL+F for \"Georgeann\" isn't highlighting anything on either page of reviews. I needed that review as reference for this review, as I don't want to hold Touch of Thai and Thai Lahna to different standards. HOW FAIR AND BALANCED OF ME. But I digress.  So I originally was going to give Touch of Thai one less star than Thai Lahna. To me, the sauces just weren't as flavorful and the Thom Yom Gai wasn't as orgasmic. That's not to say it wasn't good. You know that saying \"Sex is like pizza, even when it's bad it's still pretty good\". Well, I've had some doughy, tasteless excuses for pizza and they were pretty damn awful, so I hereby propose to replace \"pizza\" with \"Tom Yum Gai\". I really feel like that could catch on.    Anyway, so with that in mind I was going to give this place three stars because I was PRETTY sure I gave Thai Lahna four (however, I have no way of knowing for sure because Yelp is censoring my shit like a god damn fascist). Upon further thought, I remembered that the main reason I gave Thai Lahna a star detriment was because of their kinda crappy service. Food takes a pretty long time and, while not rude, I wouldn't really call them \"friendly\" either. Plus, they only serve coke in a can. I've been in to Touch of Thai  for both eat-in and take-out and both times the service was fast and friendly, definitely nothing that would warrant a star deduction. So they go up to four stars, because that's pretty much what I'd give their food and with no service adjustments either way, I'd say that's fair.  To recap  Thai Lahna - One Star for Food + One Star for lack of service/fountain soda problems = Touch of Thai  I'd definitely go back. The great (albeit hidden) location right in Old Town, cute interior, and friendly service makes up for the minor taste issues. Besides, you know what they say about sex and Tom Yum Gai..."}
{"text":"For me, it was just too rich and greasy.I love spicy food, but this was HEAVY. I got veggie fried rice and veggie egg-rolls."}
{"text":"Spring rolls were excellent and the yellow curry was easily the best I've had. Quiet atmosphere and really good service."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this place as I work right down the street. I was very impressed!  I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai Noodle lunch special.  It comes with vegetable broth soup before the meal, which was better than what I was expecting.  My dish had a lot of flavor and was a good portion for lunch.  The plate is also served with a salad, egg roll and fried wonton.  I only wish I would have ordered it 'medium' spicy and the dish came with chopped peanuts.  I would, however, definitely order it again.  My co-worker ordered the House Fried Rice and loved the dish as well.  He stated that the 'medium' spice was perfect.  His dish also contained a lot of shrimp.  I tried it and it wasn't all that flavorful to me.  My only complaint was that when I recieved my food I had to wait close to 5 minutes before my co-worker received his food."}
{"text":"The food and staff here are great. They are really fast at getting your order and your meal out which makes it ideal for lunch if you work nearby. Interior could use some refining, but the food keeps me coming back. I've had at least 4 different dishes on the lunch menu and I've never been disappointed with the quality or portions!"}
{"text":"They have been a convenient place to get take-out food from and I've done so at least 4 or 5 times. Generally I like their food and my Thai favorites are done well. What has been extremely annoying is the poorly cooked rice I have received several times. How one box can have a mix both undercooked and overlooked rice is astounding, but it has happened more than once. If I was eating it there, I'd simply ask for it to be replaced. Being unable to expect something so simple has made me look elsewhere  when in the mood for Thai food."}
{"text":"So went here with some works peers for lunch.  Service was nice, want to be clear about that.   We had a large group and they did a good job with splitting tabs and getting our stuff quickly.   Food: eh.  I had the Sweet & Sour Chicken and the chicken itself was good.  Plenty of chicken in the bowl.  But the sauce was not good at all.  I didn't see tomatoes,  but the sauce tasted like it had tomato soup in it.  It really threw off the flavors.  Price was solid, $10."}
{"text":"Decor has been or is in transition. New floor/carpet. Looks good.   I had Pat Peking. ? It was beef, green beans, carrot s in a brown spicy sauce. It might have been the best tasting and hottest spicy food I have ever actually loved. Served with rice, wonton and soup...perfect,!  The staff its awesome too...they hustle.  My lips are returning to normal now."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy this place. I got the chow mein noodle dish with beef and vegetables, which was especially delicious. I've also tried their pad thai which was also very good. We've never dined at the restaurant, but picking up the food is always a seamless endeavor. If you're in the mood for good Thai, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I found the portions to be very small for the price. I had the garlic chicken for dinner and the amount of chicken in the dish probably added up to the size of a small kitten."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to touch of Thai  and by all accounts it was a good one!  The staff was pleasant and helpful, and the appearance is strip mall chic, but pleasant inside.  We started with a large won ton soup which was served in a large round bowl with a flaming cone in the center serving to keep the soup hot.  Cool.  Dishes served were BBQ pork which was good, but not what we were expecting.  Also, cashew chicken which was delicious and perfectly seasoned as medium heat, and my daughter had the shrimp fried rice of which we brought 3/4 home with us.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in town for Thai food.  Also vegan friendly.  We've been to some other places and have been very disappointed but this place is always consistent"}
{"text":"One of the reasons that I really like TOT is the waiters. We all know that Thai food is spicy - but at TOT they give you little jars of extra spicy sauce you can add to your dishes. While taking our order, our waiter stopped mid sentence, jaw dropped, when he noticed the just-vacated table behind ours, with the jars completely empty. \"OMG, I just filled those up! SOMEbody's going to be in the bathroom ALL NIGHT.\" haha - yes, i'm 12 and think that potty jokes are funny. But really? Most waiters at Asian restaurants are really straightlaced and polite - this guy, totally hilarious!  Anyways. My other reason for liking this place, bathroom humor aside, is the food. It is really good. Now, I know that everyone likes the Tohm Yahm Goong soup, but that stuff is HECKA sour. Yes, i know it's supposed to be (since it's Thai style hot and sour soup), but I think the Gai Tohm Khah would have been a little more palatable, since it has coconut milk in it. Aside from the Tohm Yahm soup, I haven't met a dish here that I didn't like.   Good noodle dishes - aside from everyone's favorite, Pad Thai, the Guayteaw Graprao (spicy flat rice noodles with meat) is really good... you know... actually, any of the noodle dishes (#s 54-57 on the menu) are really good. The curries are all tasty, especially the Panang.   And for $8-9 a dish, very affordable. Look for a buy one get one 1/2 off coupon in the Entertainment book (or maybe you bring the Entertainment card...)."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food and a quaint environment. Ordered the spring rolls and chicken pad Thai with a Thai Iced Tea. Food was piping hot and drink complemented the spiciness if the dish. I ordered medium spice and it was a bit too spicy for me. The next visit I got mild spice and it was perfect!   My friend got the spicy noodles and they were delicious (glad she shared a bite with me!)  It was a slower night, so we spent almost an hour after we ate just sitting and visiting. The servers were so sweet about it and kept bringing us refills on our drinks. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"everyday I call they say they are close even when we call at 2:20pm. very rude all they say when we call is  \"touch of tai\" me- \"hi how are you I want to place and order\"  them- \"we close\" me- but its not closing time them- \"oh well, we are closed\" very rude, so unproffesional!  will be posting this on facebook as well and all other social media!!!!!"}
{"text":"Totally acceptable Thai place. It's usually on the bland side (order spicier than usual!), but otherwise the taste is typically there. The pad thai is weirdly sweet. If you eat a lot of thai food, you'll not be impressed. If you don't eat much thai food, it's still good food!"}
{"text":"I was craving some pad thai and I noticed this place when I was headed to the Arrowhead area. I will say that the staff were really friendly but the pad that was just ok. It was made with ramen noodles and not pad thai noodles. I asked for thai hot, and it was no where near hot, let alone thai hot. I will say that the eggrolls I got were very tasty, but the pad thai left much to be desired. I will give this place it another try to see if it was a fluke."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I love this place. The food is incredible and the service is great. The cashew chicken is the best I've ever had. AND the prices are great. Also, if you one to go all out, try the homemade coconut ice cream. EHRMAHGERD so delicious!"}
{"text":"SEAFOOD LOVERS!!!!!!!GET THE CHILI CATFISH and add seafood and extra vegetables. Probably the most wonderful thai food I have ever had in my life. Their catfish is like no other. Lightly breaded and super tender. And so many vegetables. Oh. My. God. I still wish they would serve brown rice tho."}
{"text":"Hidden Jem just off the old Scottsdale \"strip\"...    Great food, fast service with a smile and pretty nice atmosphere too.  My first bite of yellow chicken curry with noodles 'HOT' made me smile.   I said right away to my friends with me...\"It is hard to get spicy food right, they did it.  It is the spicy that tastes good, not that just burns your mouth.\"    I love these smaller restaurants that really make you feel special and welcome as soon as you come in.  They take pride in their food and it shows.  I feel like they actually enjoyed their work and took pride in it.   Great place I strongly recommend"}
{"text":"Well 20+ check ins in less than 5 months should be a great indicator of how good this place is. You literally cannot go wrong with anything you order here. I am mostly here for lunch but I've ordered off the regular menu as well and portions are huge, prices are low and taste is excellent. Give it a try, the staff is super nice & friendly and service is fast and always on point."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the NW valley. The Penang Curry is amazing. If you're not a curry person, try the sweet and sour dishes, they're super crispy and full of flavor. Don't forget the Egg Rolls.  Service is friendly and fast, with reasonable prices. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I have been going to Touch Of Thai for years.  I have tried tons of other Thai food places in valley.  My personal experience has been that Touch Of Thai is BY FAR the best and most reasonably priced place to get Thai food.  I have tried probably 75% of the menu and can say every item is GREAT.  Give them a shot, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has the best pad thai and chicken saytay. I mostly order pickup and the food is always delicious. The staff has always been friendly and my orders are correct. The only slight issue is the restaurant running out of chicken saytay, perhaps it being overly delicious."}
{"text":"This place was off the chain a great place for lunch was on this side of town and was more than stoked from the service to the quality of the food and desert was just awesome highly recommend the tai tea and sticky rice !!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems of North Phoenix/ Glendale. I recently discovered this place after we were searching for some Thai restaurants in the area. The food was amazing and the service was top-notch. One of the best casual dining joints in the area and definitely the best Thai food I have ever had. We go back here once every couple of weeks and often take out. The Red Curry is amazing."}
{"text":"YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!  Oh. My. Lord. Best Thai Food in Phoenix.  Erawan=no. Pink Pepper=only when I'm starving Touch of Thai=anytime. any day.  I'm obsessed with Thai food. The best I've had was in California but now that I'm here, I go for Touch of Thai. Wowsa. The Pad Thai and Pad See Ew is incredible.  The servers are very nice. It can get busy but seriously, it's worth any wait.  MAN! I WANT SOME RIGHT NOW!!!"}
{"text":"I chose this place as one of my 2 weekend restaurants to go to.  And I am so glad I did!  I have been waiting to find an amazing Thai restaurant and I found it!  So the place is beautiful and clean.  While inside you would never know you were in a strip mall.  We ordered the Chicken Pad Thai Hot and the Sweet and Sour Pork.  It came out in less than 10 minutes!  We were so surprised!  And the waitress was so nice.  I am very picky about my pad thai and the flavor combination.  This one was right on!  It was perfectly sweet but so spicy with the slight egg flavor.  It made my eyes roll back as my taste buds were in heaven.  I am glad to say this is my Thai spot.  The sweet and sour was mouth watering.  The tricky thing about sweet and sour is the sauce can taste face or pre-bought.  Not at TOT!  It was so good and fresh and it was a great choice.  I HIGHLY recommend and I can't wait to go back and try the curry."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get Thai food in the surrounding area.   They make one of the best Tom Yum Soup. Their Orange and Red curries are delicious.   The service is good and is a small place."}
{"text":"My friends and I were debating on what to eat for dinner and we decided that we wanted some spicy Asian food. So, we had settled on Touch of Thai, because we all enjoyed Thai food.  The place had a catchy name, good location and was pleasing on the inside. I ordered a Thai iced tea and red curry with beef and white rice (medium spice). The Thai iced tea was flavorful and refreshing. The curry was great but I wish they have me a bit more beef. The spice not as spicy as I thought it would have been but spicy enough to enjoy the meal.  The waitress and service was great, food came quickly and there were no problems at all. Overall,  it was a really good tasting Thai restuarant at a good price."}
{"text":"We found this place on our way to another restaurant and pulled in on a whim. Good choice.  The lunch special was reasonably priced and there was lots of it. Enough for another meal that will probably have leftovers. The soup that started the meal was amazing, but I don't know what it was called. We both tried the red curry with coconut milk and chicken. It has a fancy name that I can't remember. We ordered it hot and it really, truly was. I don't usually have issues with hot food, but this was enough that we were slurping down drinks and laughing about it.  Good thing the waitresses were on point. We never had an empty glass.  I can't wait to come back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Really good authentic Thai.  Try the red curry chicken.  This place may have the best lunch deal in town.  $8.95 for curry chicken and it came with soup, egg roll, crab rangoon, rice and salad with a great peanut dressing."}
{"text":"The pad Thai is too sweet, but they do have good curry and tomyum. Probably I'll come back to explore the menu more."}
{"text":"My Husband and I had the Pad Thai Shrimp, which was a pastey mess. We got our food to go, and unbeknownst to us we had noodle cake. Unfortunately I have to give them a star which is a generous rating. The Thai Ice tea was alot syrupy, so if you like pastry noodles, and syrupy Thai tea then you'll luv this place"}
{"text":"Ok; I've been wanting Thai for a very long time! Had a favorite restaurant I went to while pregnant in California. First Thai food experience in AZ...eh! My first bite of the pad Thai with most of the Yelp reviews had pictures of was just ok! My first bite I took of shrimp was exciting...until I realized that would be my ONLY bite of shrimp! One? Really? That's not the Thai food experience I'm used to. The flavor is great! I also ordered chili eggplant that came with chicken and rice! It tastes good. I am just left with disappointment in knowing my shrimp is gone and I didn't get my Thai food fix :("}
{"text":"Dined in the other night. They have all types of imported beers from Asia which is fun! The entrees were a bit disappointing as they basically had no meat. Same with wontons, just breading. Great service though!"}
{"text":"Food was prompt and both waitresses provided good service to me and my girl. They refill water  and napkins at every chance. We had the pad Thai - it had a great portion and moderate spice, and the yellow curry- thick and flavorful just missing a bit more spice ( we got it hot, it tasted like mild). Overall it was a great experience. I would truly go back with my girl any day."}
{"text":"Smells delicious. It was recommended by Yelp and the reviews are legit. This place is great and fairly undercover. The restaurant was not packed at all. We got in and were promptly served. Portions were huge. I asked for spicy everything and it came out kinda mild but my wife likes it that way. So all in all we will be going back often."}
{"text":"This is very good Thai. All fresh ingredients and spices were just right. Very tasty!!"}
{"text":"This review is for dinner on Sat, Aug 20th.  My bro and his ladyfriend have wanted to take me and my man-guy here for a while. Finally hooked it up.   First impression... meh. It is ok inside, nothing fancy, and nearly totally empty at 7 pm on a Saturday... close to primetime dinner hour for nw Phx. Rut-roh.   Our server... servers?... could not have been more attentive, from the minute we sat down until we left nearly two hours later. Oh yeah, and they managed this as a steady stream of people began to fill the place. And more people. We ordered beef & chicken satay (w/peanut sauce & cucumber salad with chiles)... both excellent. Oh, and the chicken & beef cabbage wraps. The chicken was astronomically tasty, yum!! Beef was soooo good too.   Entrees, in order of yumminess: chile catfish (hot), pad Thai seafood (hot), chile eggplant with chicken (med-hot), and duck something. The first three were phenomenal, spiced perfectly to order, steaming hot fresh and just bursting with flavor. The heat was never overwhelming and easily dowsed with a frosty cold one. We ate ourselves silly, drank through countless stories and laughs, and walked out of there with leftovers for under $62 per couple. The man-guy and I cannot wait to go back. Food, service are incredible. The pricing makes this place feel like a steal next to other Thai spots. Ambiance is simple but I felt as welcome as a guest in someone's home.   A new favorite... love it!!"}
{"text":"Small casual atmosphere. EXCELLENT food. Best Thai food in the greater Phoenix area. The wonton soup is fantastic!!! I had a spicy beef dish with peppers and onions requested spicy and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"The wonton soup was to die for! I had the garlic chicken and it was delicious. My fiancé had the basil beef which was also good but not as good as mine. The portions were huge, plenty to take home for another meal. The ratio of meat to the amount of rice they give is like 4:1 but the waiter offered more when he saw we finished it all quickly, so we had some to bring home with leftovers so that was cool. The dining room was open and airy and there was nice music playing, all and all a great little restaurant. I'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"first time i went, i asked for the pad thai WITHOUT shrimp (it comes with tofu and chicken) and WITHOUT bean sprouts. she said \"oh they put the bean sprouts on the side\" (yet they still sprinkle some sprouts in the noodles). so basically she was going to make me pick them all off the plate by hand when she could simply tell the chef to leave them out.. anyway, they brought it back without shrimp AND tofu (i wanted the tofu).   for a drink i ordered the thai milk tea with boba (off their menu). the (asian) waitress had no idea what i was talking about, she didnt know what boba was. i had to talk to the manager and ask him \"you have boba right?\" and he immediately knew what i was talking about and made one for me. if you frequent asian restaurants, you should know what boba is.  second time i went, i went during lunch and they only gave me a lunch menu. i asked for a regular menu and she said she'd bring one. i ended up walking to the front and grabbing it myself after a few minutes. it's a small restaurant and wasn't busy. then i order the pad thai same way as the first visit (they got it right this time).  she says: \"how spicy?\" me: \"none at all, i dont like spicy\" her: \"okay, mild, and for you sir?\" my BF: \"i think she said no spice\" her: \"ok so very mild\" luckily it came back with no spice, but they should know the difference b/t mild and \"none at all\"  lastly, this is no reason to complain but even though i ordered off the lunch menu, they still brought me a soup. either they make soup for everyone at lunch hour or they are disorganized.  OVERALL, i know i'm picky but jeez, ive never had a problem with all the other countless thai places ive been to in california and arizona."}
{"text":"Extremely impressed with this place! High quality food! The sweet and sour chicken is delicious. The chicken is perfectly done. I am very impressed with the way they package their to go orders. The sauce was placed separately to not soggy the crispy chicken. Love the extra time they put in for their customers."}
{"text":"I'm going to make this short and sweet. Hands down best food I've ever tasted. From the steamed muscles in a basil, lemongrass, ginger broth to the red curry to the Thai tea ice cream with sticky rice.  I've never experienced such flavors.  I've never gotten up from a meal in so long where all my senses were aroused.  Amazing."}
{"text":"So delicious! We had lunch with our son here and the service was so kind and welcoming. The menu had a ton of amazing options. We absolutely loved the Korean bbq chk and the chk curry! So good! Will definitely be coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Service prompt, very friendly, perfection!!! Food beyond delicious!!! Mixed appetizer of fried shrimp, zucchini, bananas, egg rolls, won ton, sweet potato oh my goodness the light delicate breading the crunch and flavor to die for!!! Sweet and sour sauce the perfect mix!!! Clear noodle soup you have to try!!! Wow so my flavor a party in my mouth!!!! Don't forget your Thai iced tea, yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just as the other reviews said great food!  Excellent service!  Fresh rice rolls were plenty and very good (we got both chicken and shrimp) silver noodles are nice and healthy w plenty of leftovers!  \"Thai hot\" for my husband passed his love of spice on his dish!"}
{"text":"Not the most modernized restaurant you've ever been to, but great food and service for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Very impressed on my first visit. Tried Red Curry Chicken Hot and it was no joke. The rice was nice and cooked perfectly. I know that rice is the most mundane part of the meal but if if they can't get that right there's definitely a problem. They are big on curries and have kind of a small menu. Hot is hot here and that's what I'm lookin for. Looks like a young  Thai couple run it and they are super nice. I'll be back for sure.."}
{"text":"The drunken noodles I had yesterday were fantastic, I prefer more spicy but that I would order that way next time, loved the thom gai soup, will definitely come again and try more things. Place isn't fancy which is fine with the good food"}
{"text":"This place deserved a 2.5 star rating but that was not an option.  Despite the prior reviews, I was disappointed after eating here. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good.  We had egg rolls (which ended up being spring rolls), panang chicken and a shrimp dish. The shrimp were small Whig was overcompensated by the green beans. The curry dish was the best dish we had."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp soup #15 as a takeout order while I was home sick, the soup was delicious and the portion lasted all day, this soup with all its aromatics actually made me feel better. Very authentic thai , well done Touch of thai! I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times with my friend K when we both get a craving for thai food. They have very good thai iced tea, and whenever we go, all of our items are hot and delicious. She usually gets some sort of soup item and some appetizers. I usually get the chicken satay, and the phad thai with chicken and tofu.   I only remember some minor issues with this place: 1) ordering something mild doesn't always get you mild, in fact one of my dishes was pretty darn spicy. A little surprising. 2) My friend K had a gross shrimpy incident, where she pulled all of the shrimp out of whatever dish she got because they tasty old and...\"yucky\".  I never order shrimp so.. yeah. But the chicken and tofu are always A+!  :)"}
{"text":"Their curry is so yummy! Ordered for take out and when we went to pick up I got to meet the infamous witty waiter, who took his last chance to see if we wanted to eat in! He's funny. Just for that ,next time we're eating in. We ordered the green curry, but got the #52 curry, and although I wanted the green curry, I very much enjoyed the 52. haha. The food was pretty good, pad thai seemed a bit sweet for me, but not too much for me to not like it. We had some other beef and vegetable meal with carrots, onions and broccoli i believe, I really liked that too. The BF wanted to just order 2 curry's, after that I know I could be totally satisfied getting 2 different curry's. I'll be back for another touch of thai!"}
{"text":"Decor  functional  Staff friendly and are really kind to our toddler food rocks  within my  limited range of  red and yellow curries ( so much so they suggested I try something else, hey it's not my fault these are so good that I didn't want to risk anything lesser.   Prices are a bargain for entrees,  spice is there, they really get the request to make it very very hot.   This is probably the best bargain  in North Phoenix for  spice hounds"}
{"text":"If you've never tried Thai food before, this is a great place to try the lunch specials.   Great Thai for lunch. Touch of Thai offers excellent lunch specials for $8.95. Specials come with rice, soup, and an egg roll. Lunch specials are available Monday- Friday 11am-2:30pm.   If you are not a fan of spicy make sure to order \"mild\" or \"mild-mild\" as the food is spicy. I normally order Thai hot, so I ordered it hot. It was too hot, so I ordered additional red curry sauce without any spice.   Great quality food and selection.  I love the red curry chicken. The vegetables are crisp and the chicken is moist.   They are pretty busy during 11am-130pm. The service is always friendly and quick.  I love the layout of the tables as you don't feel like you're sitting too close to other tables."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is gonna be our new joint. The atmosphere is awesome, we were met with the best smell just walking in the door, the service was amazing, and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok. This is on my lunch rotation as I work in N. Phoenix so I occasionally stop here.  Service is always ok, decor is about on par with other Phoenix Thai joints located in yet another infamous strip mall. Prices are reasonable, portions are ok.  The reason I would not give them 4 stars is because the last time I went I asked for VERY hot and the dish was not. I had a spicy basil tofu dish and the tofu was severely lacking. I know how much tofu costs; even the good stuff is relatively cheap - load me up!  This has got to be one of the most boring reviews ever but maybe I am getting my point across about Touch of Thai. If you are in N. Phoenix there are certainly worse places to eat, meh.......whatever."}
{"text":"great thai food in phoenix. have tried a couple of the thai restaurant around phoenix, so far none of them hit my taste bud. this one does a job well. if you like thai food. this one will be the one to try."}
{"text":"I have eaten here quite a few times and havent been disappointed. I really like their pad thai and you can get various levels of spicy. I have only gotten take out. Pricing is average as well as wait time."}
{"text":"I will be the first to admit I am sort of a Thai food snob.   The tom yum gai was delish! The pad-thai was so-so.  I have definately had better.  I think that overall though it is for sure worth checking it out!"}
{"text":"I'm upping this to 5 stars. Everything we've had has been incredibly tasty, and anytime I'm in the area and hungry, Touch of Thai is the first place I think to go."}
{"text":"The food was good.  The paht Thai weirdly reminded me of seaweed salad in flavor. Not what I'm used to but still good. My mom said her food was really greats you and too rich and heavy. The waitress seemed annoyed at anything we asked for."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre and the prices match. I'll go in a pinch, but there's a better spot only about a mile away. The service is always a bright spot, though."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday and ordered one of their Lunch Specials - Number L8 with meat (chicken + beef). The dish looked nice on arrival but the meat - both the chicken and beef - was pathetic. The beef especially; it was so rubbery (or chewy) that I had to chew it for some time to break it down. The chicken was very dry and did not have any flavor. The sauce that held the entire dish together can be best described as \"meh\". Some of my colleagues ordered fried rice and it was just OK; nothing great.   The only positive here are the prices; food, especially lunch is cheap. But sadly so is the taste. This is place is out of my list of Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm sorry for not being able to give a full review of this place, but it was bad - REAL bad!  There were four of us in our party and after rejecting the first seat that was full of worn off red duct tape - we were sat down by a pleasant enough person and order 3 diet cokes and a Corona. One person from the party had to use the restroom and when she returned - it was about over with for food. I wanted to check things out myself, because I know that the cleanliness of a restroom can reveal significant deficiencies for the entire restaurant.. I couldn't even GET to the bathroom - when I opened the door to where the restrooms were - I had to immediately turn around. The smell of urine was SO strong there was no change we were going to stay and eat.  I couldn't believe the sign in the front door mentioned Yelp and I couldn't believe the rating of this place. We paid $11.21 for our three cokes and a beer and left for True Foods!   I have to give this place a one star because I cannot go lower, but this was the absolute worst place I have ever been too and hope I don't find one worse!"}
{"text":"Yumm!  Thai tea, spicy Thai beef salad, number 23a and a 32, all of it was delicious! I recommend this place. Just don't go in a hurry because you will be there a while"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years and have never been disappointed. Best Pad Thai. Order it medium with extra nuts."}
{"text":"Ordered in for dinner and am I so grateful for that choice! I selected the egg rolls and fried rice with shrimp, chicken and pineapple. Solid choice for both, but especially on the fried rice entree. They add onion and curry, which makes the flavor truly incredible!!!! Just try it, I don't see you being disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty much my favorite Thai place in town, lucky it's right next to my house. Great service and food, highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. I've tried the tom yum soup, beef salad, and Panang curry. All have been bomb. The spice level is pretty mild so ordering hot isn't too much."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. I was at an art show across the street, starving, late on a Saturday night and I knew I didn't want to deal with the hustle and bustle of old town eateries, I was so glad to stumble upon this amazing hidden jewel.  My boyfriend and I happen to be the only two in the place so our service was of course outstanding. The food was great, we split the crab puffs, which were nothing special but still good. I had the beef fried rice, just the presentation was impressive in itself the so to no surprise the taste was equally well over par. My boyfriend had a chicken curry dish he still raved about days later.  The only thing that might have made our experience less than perfect is that I ordered a pear saketini and the glass came only half full, strange, and the music was less then appealing, if I heard another instrumental version of the song from Titanic one more time during or meal I was going to scream, literally it played four times while we we there, which was only about an hour and a half.  Over all well worth the price we got out of there just under $45 including drinks."}
{"text":"DELICIOUSNESS! That's the word of the day, and it belongs to 'Touch of Thai.' I ate here twice during my last visit to Scottsdale, and I'm already excited to come back in a few weeks! ::wipes drool from chin::  I judge a thai restaurant by it's noodle dishes, and the brown sauce noodles here were amazing! It was perfectly spiced, steaming hot, and the veggies were crisp and fresh. I enjoyed a perfect thai iced tea, too! Funny story - I found this place on Yelp the day after I arrived in AZ. When I went in, it was empty, and I was a little nervous. But the minute the food arrived, I felt right at home, stuffing my face with pleasure-inducing food! Mid-meal, this group of cougar conference goers came in and commented on the scent. They eventually asked me to join them for drinks after, but I declined. I was tired :D.   When I returned for lunch, I took advantage of their well-priced specials. I had the yellow curry with chicken while fellow Yelper Megan C. tried the red curry with chicken. Yummy, Yummy! Yummy! There was plenty to take home, and I did!.. too bad I left it in the work fridge (Oh, no! I'm one of those!!)  Service is fantastic. Prices are just right. Plenty of parking.  If you're looking for a gem-of-a-thai-restaurant, try Touch of Thai!"}
{"text":"I'm only going to review this restaurant for lunch as I haven't had dinner here yet.  With that said I enjoyed this place.  The food is spicy like most Thai food is.  Portions are a little small for the lunch specials, but still is enough food to fill you up.  Service is very attentive and the food comes out much quicker than expected.  The decor is somewhat old looking but still has some flair to it.  Overall I'll keep this place on my radar for when I want some good  Thai food that won't disappoint me.  I don't think you can go wrong with checking this restaurant out."}
{"text":"No, No No! What in the H...well, first of all - how does this place have 4 Stars? What type of Thai are you guys (those in Phoenix/Scottsdale) exposed to?  This place should certainly NOT be 4 stars. Are these sober reviews?  I was in town on business and my colleagues and I were looking for good food nearby.  This place showed up as 4 stars on Yelp and when I heard this I was really excited.  Seeing as I come from a place that is very, VERY spoiled with Thai food I expect that other places won't match it.  I keep my expectations in check...but Jesus, Mary, & Joseph these ratings couldn't have been further off.  First off, lets start with the cleanliness factor.  I'm used to the hole in the wall type of places, I actually like hole in the wall types and frequently get food from those types however, they are clean.  I walked through and this place was dirty and more importantly the bathroom was DISGUSTING. I opened the door and was hit in the face with the stench as if a pipe busted.  If your bathroom is worse than what I find at a gas station in the middle of nowhere ---problems.   We quickly order off their menu and I mention that I wanted the Pad See Ew.  Pretty standard Thai. right?  Well, what I got in front of me - literally 7 minutes later was NOT Pad See Ew.  I don't even know what the hell it even was.  I couldn't even tell if it was Ka Pow or... it just looked like slop. The noodles weren't properly cooked, there were no veggies in my dish and it CLEARLY has veggies in it, the noodles were thin, and the ginger sauce looked like old gravy.  This place has poor food (I can't even call it Thai  because I didn't  know what was on my plate).  Your best bet is to stick with Hispanic or Greek food around these parts - and yes, I'll remember my own advice the next time I think about Thai in Phoenix.  I would certainly NOT recommend this place to Yelpers."}
{"text":"Love me some Touch of Thai (a name that lends itself to being thought of as more a massage parlor and less a Thai restaurant). A few months ago I'd been looking for some tasty Thai in the Phoenix area as I was bored of the ush (usual) Chinese. The first time I had Thai,  I was in Queens and then more recently had some in SF, so my little Arizona girl tongue had been spoiled. That being said, I was looking for my fave dish, drunken noodles. I didn't find them by name on the menu so I tried what seemed to be the most comparable. Since then, I've been Noodle Public Enemy #1 (watch out noodles).  Tonight, I was craving my tasty spicy noodles baaaaad, guys. So we ventured over to Touch of Thai to quench the thirst (no copyright infringement, Sprite). We were seated fairly quickly but it was several noticeable minutes before anybody came over to take our drink order. Finally, a young adolescent came over to take the drink order (us splurging on a couple of Cokes), but then we were still left craving that bubbly goodness for a while. No biggie but I definitely heard a lady aggressively ask the kid if he had given us our Cokes (sorry kid...I know it's not your fault, man). We eventually placed our food order. I got my ush spicy noodles and my bf got pad thai, as well as an order of chicken satay.   Chicken satay is the bomb. Love it. Super juicy and tender and that peanut sauce would make someone with allergies take the risk. My noodles were tasty but I much prefer when the beef slices are a little thinner. No bigs but hey might as well mention it. Awesome food but tonight the speed of service of general lagging. I know they had a couple of bigger groups (6 in one and 8 in another), but overall the place was not poppin enough to excuse the wait for some things like a glass of water and a drink refill.  Tried the red curry with chicken here once. Not as flavorful as some others I've had which is quite the bummer summer, Judy Moody.   Long story not so short, dig this place but mostly because it is so close to our house."}
{"text":"pretty darn tasty if you ask me!  I picked up to go on the way home, i really wanted to go to Bangkok Thai but its not really on my way home so i thought i would check out this little gem.  Of course my order consisted of Chicken Green Curry med and Pad thai combo and usually I get Tom Kah but I went for beef satay this time cause the bf, who has never had thai before, asked for something with beef.  The green curry tasted just as expected, creamy and delish with just the perfect amount of spice for med, i prefer it hotter but again the bf is new to thai. The pad thai was lacking on the protein front for being combo but the flavor was quite nice even though the noodles were a little too sticky. Im not a huge skewered beef fan but my bf enjoyed every last bit of the beef satay. I do have to say the peanut sauce was lacking a little heat even though it was tasty.  Whenever I have a hankering for some thai on my way from home work i will definately have this place on my radar."}
{"text":"We went to the place, just like that after hearing some good reviews. But, unfortunately we did not like much of it. The food is more typical and traditional thai, than we were used to, on the top of that the tacky interiors were a bummer. I'm a sucker for food and ambience... we asked for doggy bag and the waiter took the food with her and packed it inside, i did not feel good about it, so even after taking it home, i did not not eat it. But overall service was nice and very polite.  I guess i might go there after 6 months, if im totally out of places to go.. probability of which is pretty low."}
{"text":"This is place is decent. It does the trick if you're craving thai.   I went with a couple of my girlfriends, and we got the sweet and sour chicken, pepper steak, and another beef dish that came with pineapples. We started out with the stuffed chicken appetizer and that was pretty delicious. It was different . The sauce that came with it even makes it better. The sweet and sour chicken was amazing! It's probably the best I've had anywhere and I don't even really like chicken. That dish was definitely 5 stars.  The pepper steak dish was pretty good too. It was just the right amount of spicy and had lots of flavor. The other steak dish was just really blah. It lacked flavor and looked ugly. The rice was good. We got the crunchy banana sundae with coconut ice cream and it was just eh. I don't recommend dessert.   I'll probably be back if I don't find other nearby places. Like I said, it does the trick. It wasn't WOW food but it wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"Always have a great experience here. Friendly staff, fast service and amaaaazing food. The yellow curry is the ultimate comfort food! And if you have a sweet tooth try the Thai iced tea  As far as spice goes, I have a pretty moderate tolerance for spice and I do just fine with medium heat."}
{"text":"A touch of Thai -- literally.  Maybe, the name said it all.  Just a tad bit not too much or it might overwhelm you!  Seriously, I need my Thai not just a touch!  Food was decent I must say, but kinda pricey.  Though I enjoyed my Dragon Noodles regardless.  Service was okay, very friendly, but tad bit slow since there were only 2 other tables around.  I totally dig the décor, very calm and relaxed.  However, my only complaint was that it was too quiet.  What!?  I felt like I had to whisper cause someone could be listening in on my conversation.  (Yeah, if I were a girl I would date him....huh!) - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here countless times. This is my go-to place for Thai food in Phoenix. I have been to many different restaurants around West Valley, but this is one of the best. I love coming here for lunch on the weekdays. They have a special lunch menu Mon-Fri 11am-2:30pm that includes a main course combined with soup, eggroll, and wonton. I usually go for some chicken yellow curry over rice.   For dinner, I highly recommend getting the Tohm Yahm Goong, the most delicious hot & sour soup; this is my favorite item on the menu! My boyfriend gets the Paht Thai that comes with chicken/tofu/shrimp, and he likes adding more heat from the spice tray that is provided. I also enjoy the Pineapple Fried Rice, my comfort food from a long day of work. If you're looking for a nice drink, I would recommend the Thai ice tea.    They are closed Monday-Friday 2:30pm - 5pm. Service is fast. You can also order take out, and it'll be ready for pick-up within 15-20 minutes."}
{"text":"I like pad thai. I really do.   And that is about as much as I know about thai food. That being said, I do like Touch of thai.  The staff is always friendly and the food is always tasty. However, there are two shrimp on my pad thai.  Only one when my husband takes his shrimp that I am pretty sure were written into our vows when we wed.   It went something like... \"In sickness and health, to always give me a shrimp off your plate, till death do us part\" Anyway, a couple more wouldn't kill them. Also, the place is kind of.... well.... run down?  The decor is a bit out of date, there are strange stains in strange places.... the bathroom is....well, not nearly as bad as a gas station in Blythe, but not awesome either. But, the food is good. A little mild, come on guys I can handle it."}
{"text":"This is great thai. Very good service.large portions. Rgg rolls curry well done. Be back. Love this little spot"}
{"text":"Nice vegetrian section on the menu that reproduces all the options that could come with meat (instead of just implying you could sub tofu).   Good stuff; got take-out tonight of (Vegetarian) Spicy Noodle and had a Thai Iced Tea while I waited. I asked for in-between medium and hot on the former and it came out just right. The Thai Iced Tea was standard issue. 12 bucks for the dinner and drink. Very happy with that I had."}
{"text":"I'm visiting family in the Phoenix area for a couple of weeks. I was getting hungry for Thai food, but don't know the area well enough to know where all the good Thai restaurants are. I asked a family friend and she suggested this place, as she's a regular.  Touch of Thai is a little restaurant located in a strip mall in Peoria, AZ. Don't let the unimpressive setting deter you from a visit!  Five of us came in for a late lunch today and were treated very well. The waitstaff was friendly and the service top-notch. However, the food is the true stand-out here, and it's very reasonably priced. The red curry ranks up with the best I've had in my home state of Minnesota, and we have a LOT of Thai restaurants.   If you've saved room for dessert, order a \"snowball,\" which consists of black sticky rice and coconut ice cream, and be prepared for a real taste treat... their ice cream is made on premises. I'm glad we split it because I might've ended up eating the whole thing myself.  I may try some other Thai places while I'm here, but I could end up comparing them to this one. Touch of Thai was a great intro to Thai food in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Server was confused when I asked if it was Northern or Southern Thai, Not a good sign when you say your Thai restaurant. Lunch was forgettable as most  Americanized Thai is."}
{"text":"Staff - Super Nice  Beer - Cold  Food - Amazing  Mike - Happy"}
{"text":"If you are thai food lover, this is the place for you. They even had a seperate vegetarian menu for me. I have been here twice in a week inspite of a galore of restaurants in this upscale neighborhood. The waiter was very polite, I hope to visit here again if I am back in the area.Food price was also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. It's small and unassuming, yet smells absolutely delicious upon walking in the door. I'll be the first to admit I'm an odd duck when it comes to restaurants. I find one item on the menu that I fall madly in love with, and then crave that meal to the point of distraction. For me it is the Thai BBQ chicken. It is delightfully delicious. Spicy, sweet, tangy and sticky. This is a pick off the bone, roll up your sleeves and lick your fingers kind of dish. It never disappoints and is honestly enough to split. My boyfriend usually gets the Pad Thai and I can say it is one of the best I have ever had. That being said, I am not well versed in Thai food, so my bastardized American pallet may very well not recognize traditional Thai cuisine. The service here is always friendly and the wait time for pick up (I should not be eating this meal in public) the finger licking, lip smacking and guttural noises of enjoyment are almost pornographic) Is usually no more then 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I really like Touch of Thai. My eating out adventures usually stem from my good friend Kevin, who is a vegetarian, and though very nice, I wouldn't want to serve him in a restaurant, just very picky....   Kevin loves this place, always suggesting that we go there, the other day I happily agreed, as it is not even very far from my house.  The service is always great, very nice people run this place. Become a regular (like my friend Kevin) and the service and food is even better.   This time we had the Tohm Khah soup with tofu, it had always been one of my favorites as i think it blends spice and coconut milk together so very nicely. make sure to order some steamed rice to come along with the soup as it is perfect to soak up all the goodness.   We also had the Panang Curry with tofu, and it has carrots and green beans in it too, med spice on this one today was pretty warm, but not to the point where we couldn't enjoy our meal.   As for the price, a great deal. Lunch combos for only 5.95, and our soup was 8.95 and was enough for both of us to enjoy we didn't even finish it all and took it home for later.   For some reason even tho the decor is kinda...well.....i don't know the right word for it.... but anyway for some reason this place just makes me only want to eat out at local business you know, make sure my income goes back into the local community?   I only have one suggestion, maybe some patio seating?, maybe just even two tables outside, the biker bar two or three businesses down the strip mall, doesn't bother or \"scare\" me at all. Its just nice to be outside sometimes.  oh one last tip if you've never been here...  Mon thru Fri they close for a break @ 2:30pm and then reopen for dinner @ 5pm . But sat and sunday they are open from noon till ten I think."}
{"text":"I've had a few other dishes and they weren't nearly as good as the first. Not many good thai places on the west side, so I guess this place will have to do."}
{"text":"This restaurant despite being in a strip mall has tried to decorate itself to look like a nicer Thai restaurant. We should have been leery when we saw the lack of customers at dinner time.   Pros: The servers are prompt and friendly. The restaurant is clean. The food tastes decent (I tried other people in my parties dishes and they were good) and there are lots of options to choose.   Cons: The lack of veggies in any of their dishes. It seems like onion is their favorite vegetable to cook with as it was the most prominent food item in any of our dishes. I ordered the veggie stir fry (expecting an assortment of veggies). There were maybe three pieces of overcooked broccoli mixed with lots of baby corn and onions in a very bland soy sauce. It was hugely disappointing. I can't say I would come back here based on this experience."}
{"text":"I have been out to a lot of Thai restaurants in DC, NYC and LA and I am happy that I found Touch of Thai. Located in a non-descript strip mall in North Phoenix, it has a really good menu full of the basics (not a lot of surprises to be found on it), very well prepared food and everything seemed fresh- an example being that the spring rolls tasted house-made and not frozen.   The yellow curry was great. It wasn't too hot but the flavors of a Thai curry are definitely spicy. Next time I'm here I'll try the red, green or Panang curry.  The chairs in the dining room- a little uncomfortable for a lengthy dinner with friends and a few Singhas. The booths looked to be more plush but definitely a tight squeeze for those seated beside one another. Lots of thigh-touch possible- as in your outer thigh touching your seat mate's outer thigh. Perhaps the inspiration behind the restaurant's name?   Service was good, but on the slow side. The house-made coconut ice cream made me wish I could buy a pint to take home.  At 6:30 on a Saturday night, there were maybe 3 other tables in the small dining room. Half an hour later, there were 6-8 people waiting for a table.  If you have friends who are afraid of Thai food, you could start them off here and they'd find plenty of mild/pretty-close-to-Chinese food choices for a meal. Vegetarians also have a multitude of options. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Good thai food for phoenix area, prompt friendly service, found after Satara closed and come here on a regular basis and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"I have eaten lunch here for years, but the last two visits have been less than stellar.  The cabbage soup was raw crunchy? cabbage swimming in chicken grease. The vegetables in the delicious basil chicken were similarly raw, although the flavors were fantastic. Rice contained huge hard scrapings from the edge of the cooker.   Servers lack communication skills and no manager was on duty yesterday.  I may not ever return.  :("}
{"text":"Yesterday was the first time I visited this restaurant. My boyfriend has been here many times previously and he suggested it. I ordered the Nuea Prig Khing medium spicy. It had beef stir-fried with curry, carrots, and green beans. I was also served a delicious soup, an egg roll, and a fried wonton. The food was awesome. It was fresh, flavorful, and just the right amount of spice. The service was also excellent. The employees were polite and quick at getting our drinks and order placed. This is my new spot for Thai food and I can't wait to return and try what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"We ordered from here for takeout and I went to pick up our order around 6:30 pm on a Friday night. I was surprised to see only one table was filled in the entire restaurant. The woman that packed our Togo order was so wonderful. She had the biggest smile and thanked me repeatedly for coming in. We ordered medium pad Thai and spring rolls with shrimp. Although there was no spiciness to the pad Thai it was amazing. I normally like my pad Thai spicy so when I order medium I expected at least a mild spicy taste but there was none. I still feel like this was one of the best pad Thai dishes I've had in Phoenix, and my boyfriend and I have tried them all. We will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Delicious food! We got the meal as takeout, so I can't speak to the service other than to say that the food was ready when they said it would be ready, and they were polite. The food was  delicious - my favorite was the Tom Yum soup, which was fabulously aromatic. The tofu spring rolls were a bit \"meh\" but other than that, we really enjoyed our chicken satay and pad Thai, and the Thai iced tea was amazingly strong - I love it!  I didn't give them 5 stars only because the food was a bit on the pricey side compared to what  I usually pay for comparable food."}
{"text":"I have really wanted to try this place for a couple years now. I hoped that today would be the day but we couldn't get past the smell of the table to even think about ordering food. The rag the woman \"cleaned\" the table with smelled like it had been wrapped around the foot of someone with severe athletes foot for a month. In August. If they can't be bothered to use a clean rag to wipe off a table for a customer I definitely don't want to bother them with making my food.   The smell was so nauseating that we decided to skip lunch altogether. There's a first!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to Flagstaff as it's located right off the I-17. Ordered the egg rolls and yellow curry. The egg rolls were delicious and get a 5/5. The yellow curry gets 3.5 or 4 out of 5. Not a big fan of potatoes in a curry. Other reviews seemed to favor the yellow curry over the red curry, so I went along. Portions are big (and especially the amount of rice -- about twice as much as you get at other restaurants)."}
{"text":"After finding out my favorite Thai restaurant is closed Monday's, I desperately search yelp mobile for the closest Thai restaurant. This one wasn't too far of a drive so I excitedly drive over to 35th Avenue and Bell. I find Touch of Thai in a less than nice strip mall, but I know better than to judge a book by it's cover.   I walk in, and am greeted not only by the hostess, but a smell. Not a \"oh my, the food smells DELISH\", but a \"what the hell is that?\" kinda smell. This is the night that I finally figured out that NO THAI RESTAURANT should ever SMELL. Any of the ones that I've ever given terrible reviews for have had a stench!   The menu is weird to say the least.  It's like I'm in a thai restaurant but am looking at a chinese menu.    The service was mediocre, and the food was less than average. I ordered my green curry a 10 on the spicy scale, and my sister ordered her spicy noodle at a 5. They screwed up and gave her the 10 and me the 5. Boy was a jealous as she was sitting across from me sweating and blowing her nose, while I add chili powder, Thai chilli's and red peppers to get that wonderful burn! No such luck...no 10, and I kinda ruined the flavor. DARN! If only they would've listened.   The green curry wasn't the best I've had.  Not a variety of vegetables that I love and get from Siam Thai.  The waitress checked on us maybe 3 times the entire meal, and she took 10 minutes to bring our check.   \"People on YELP love us\" says the sticker on their door...well I'm a people and I don't love you."}
{"text":"Friday cheat day lunch.  Got my usual for lunch Red Chicken Curry medium heat.  The heat is perfect and the food was good.  Not sure who was our server exactly, appeared to be a joint effort.  But overall great lunch"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 4 stars, the atmosphere and service was very good. I got the chicken skewers with peanut butter sauce as an appetizer, and the pad thai for dinner and both were delicious, I would also highly recommend the thai tea it's iced tea with a sweet cream in it. My Boyfriend got the Pepper steak and it was bland and watery, thus the 3 stars. Great little restaurant, but don't get the pepper steak."}
{"text":"This place gets my vote! They had generous portions, very friendly staff, and tasty food. What's not to like? We had the spicy noodle, and the green curry, made to our specifications (and no extra charge for eggplant instead of meat). I'm surprised this place doesn't have better reviews."}
{"text":"AMAZING CURRY!!!!!  I went for lunch and was very impressed.  They have a huge selection vegetarian and not and all priced very well.  I got the Red Curry Chicken with a Thai egg roll, rice and fried wonton for $6.95 what a steal.  You can get as hot as you like which I like a lot of spice in my life and they delivered.    I will be back for sure in the near future and I am kicking myself for taking this long to try it.  Also after reading reviews I saw the service was bad and I had no issues with service they were very prompt and even refilled my soda without even having to ask."}
{"text":"Just discovered this absolutely fantastic Thai restaurant!!  We ordered edamame, crab rangoons, Panang curry chicken and pineapple fried rice...    The crab rangoons were some of the best I have tasted (and I've tasted many!!) ...  it is one of my favorite appetizers to order and these tasted freshly made hot from the fryer!  The Panang curry chicken was phenomenal .. it has a coconut curry sauce over large pieces of white chicken .. had such a delicious flavor!  I chose medium spiceness (and I am a wimp when it comes to spicy) and it had just the right amount of spicy .. enjoy to clear the sinuses but not leave the mouth burning too much!!  The pineapple fried rice was tasty too ... it has shrimp and chicken with pieces of pineapple mixed in to the rice .. was very good!!  Definitely will be visiting this place again!!"}
{"text":"What  a great lunch spot!  I ordered the Yellow Curry dish and with it came a bowl of ginger rice soup, an eggroll, side of rice and some wonton chips - all for $6.95.  The curry was delicious - full of flavor!  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"They thought that they were going to make me cry \"uncle\"...or at least cry after I said \"very spicy\" for the Garlic Beef...and very spicy, it was...but they didn't know who they were dealing with...or \"with whom they were dealing\", for you grammarians out there:)  I like Thai food...more specifically, I like spicy, well made, flavorful Thai food!  That's what you get at Touch of Thai...currently holding the title of \"Best Thai Food within Walking Distance of my Home\":)  This is a lovely little spot, a little bit off the beaten path...and by \"beaten path\" I mean that it is about a block off Scottsdale Rd. and parked between a defunct gym and an \"Asian Massage\" joint, in between a bunch of offices.  It's across the corner from \"Giligin's (every now and then you can hear gales of laughter from across the street as somebody \"tosses a midget\" or something:)  The restaurant itself is lovely, with a little courtyard between its two dining areas (kind of an unusual layout), and nice open feel, a pretty little bar area...oh yeah, and the food is terrific!  A very nice Thai couple own and operate this place, and the food reflects the love and attention to detail that they put into their restaurant...the young lady that owns the place is also (apparently) the main cook and the other night when The Beautiful Carin and I had dinner, she was very concerned about over spicing the Garlic beef, and came out to see if I was going to be OK, with it (she even offered to remake the dish if I had a problem with it...but I didn't...for whatever reason, I seem to be able to metabolize capsaicin like it's candy:)  Other people try to hang with me on the hot stuff and say things \"oh my god...I think I just ate the sun\" and \"it tastes like burning\" while I ask for \"more chili oil or sriracha, please\":)  Carin doesn't like the heat so much so we had our Pad Thai (I know, seems kind of boring, but they make the dish so darn well at TOT) at medium spice and our veggie curry at low heat, all tasty and delightful!  Speaking of curries, if you are a curry fan, you could worse than to stop by TOT...they have a couple of menu pages seemingly devoted to a wide variety of yellow, red, green, blue, orange, and other rainbow colored curries (I might be exaggerating about some of the colors, but I've had some of the red and yellow curry dishes and they are as good as any I've found around here:)  They even have a whole rack of these curry dishes on their lunch special menu ($8.95 for a giant plate of lunchtime Thai:)  The next time you're in Old Town, bored by the Modern Steaks and Olive and Ivy's, get off the beaten path and give TOT a spin...they are nice people, good cooks, they seem to find both flavor and heat back in the kitchen...and if you are in the mood, you can stroll down the block after dinner or lunch and get an \"Asian Massage\" to \"settle your stomach\" :-)"}
{"text":"I had heard nothing but good things about this place, and I've been wanting to try Thai food for a while.   Initially it was a little disappointing because the place isn't the cleanest, but what they lack in cleanliness they make up for in the food!!  We got the crispy vegetarian crispy noodles, they are a little messy but delicious!! We also got the veggies with noodles and the chili eggplant, both of which were amazing!! I also recommend the Thai tea!! Soooo sweet!!!   All in all we had a good time. The service was a little slow, and the place wasn't the cleanest!! The food was amazing and the staff were very nice, hence the four stars."}
{"text":"By far the best as far as customer service I ever had. The food was delicious, especially the fried wontons! Will be coming here again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I would like to give them more stars but they have some work to do.  Foodwise its some of the best Thai food I've had in the area. Lots of options, very flavorful, well priced.   Service-wise its lacking. There is a particular waitress working there who is always very \"confused\". I assure when you go you will know who I'm talking about. No real harm done, just lots of delay and mixed up orders. But my real issue with the place is that it smells...Not like food smells but border lining sewage smell. I almost walked out of there as soon as I walked in last time I was here,  but I was starving so I decided to stay lol. I pray that its not coming from the kitchen but my 'wrenching' gut tells me its from the bathroom. The bathroom is pretty gross and unkempt for a rather nice restaurant. Both the bathroom and decor could use a little work... it would take this place from a 3 to a 4 star for sure!  Anyway, onto the food.   *Spicy Thai Fried rice- your standard fried rice, not very spicy though for my Indian tongue so you have to specify if you want spicier  *Silver noodles- so yummy, they use vermicelli-like glass noodles, al dente, mixed with veggies and your choice of meat. recommended.   * Pad thai- Also very yummy, their version comes with shrimp, tofu and chicken and the noodles are thinner than other pad thai I've had  * Red curry- Very tasty coconut red curry, sweet and spicy but different from Panang (too sweet in my opinion). Their version comes with bamboo shoots and green beans and I like to add eggplant, it really soaks up the curry  * #26- I totally forgot what this dish was called but it was number 26 under \"Entrees.\" The waitress recommended it as it is a popular item to order, and I'm glad she did. It was carrots sauteed with meat and onions in a brown sauce that reminds me a little of black bean sauce at chinese restaurants. I think everyone would like this dish!  *Thai tea- meh I've had better. I suspect they get theirs from a bottle.   I want to go back and try some other items, especially the Tom Yum.  With a little work this place could be even better!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in Phoenix! I live in north Phoenix and was often having to drive a bit of distance or go downtown to get some decent Thai food but this place is amazing in all aspects, every dish we ordered and shared was amazing as well as it having a very unique decorative interior that's perfect for the restaurant. Customer service was phenomenal and we were greeted with a smile with every encounter! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food:  A'ight, I guess.  Dishes requested mild came out spicier than things requested medium.  Authenticity seems lacking.  If this place were a little larger, I would say that it's popularity combined with its generic-osity would garner it my new ubiquitous phrase, \"Touch of Thai is the WalMart of Thai food\".  Menu: nice descriptions of items for those who may not be familiar.  decent selection  Decor:  could be straight out of a place named \"Gramma's Diner\"  Name: Awkward.  First time I ever heard of this restaurant, it was by overhearing a coworker suggest to another that they should go \"touch a Thai\".  Perked my ears up, fo sho.  I gave myself a self-invite, but was not as satisfied after eating the food as I thought I would be after touching...nevermind."}
{"text":"We're just finishing our lunch from Touch of Thai now.   On everyone's recommendation, we chose to order out, and I'm glad we did. The strip mall was horrifying (ToT is next to a biker bar), and the restaurant decor was almost enough to make us turn right back around.  Our server was adorable. Cute high school kid, really eager, came over and chatted with us while we waited for our order. He was just effortlessly likable and efficient. Major points here.  We ordered just the basics: the chicken satays, the pad thai, and the shrimp and pineapple red curry.   The portions were what I would consider lunch-sized, though we ordered from the dinner menu. Thai food to me is about the spices- the portions can easily be bulked up with tofu or veggies or something.  The satays were okay, nothing special, but done nicely.   I've had better pad thai at Pei Wei. Blech.   But the red curry... I'll admit to drinking the extra broth, it was just so good. It was creamy and well spiced and cooked long enough to bring out the flavor without tasting like it had  been going all day. It could have used a little more \"meat\"... even if not shrimp, maybe some veggies or tofu or something.  We got everything medium hot, which wasn't hot at all. Spiced, but not hot. Next time (and there will be a next time), I'll ask for \"Thai hot\".   The lunch prices on the menu were great. I wish we had gone then. As it was, our bill for an app and two entrees was over $30, which was a bit much."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Thai restaurant in the Valley! I just happened upon this place over 4 years ago.  Though the decor was a bit cheesy, it has improved over the years. The service can't be beat!  As soon as my drink is almost empty enough to flag someone down, someone comes by and takes it for a refill.  I've never even had to remind them of what I'm drinking. What to get? The Thai beef sticks with peanut sauce to start.  (By the way, I never know the real names of stuff, so bear with me) They have green, red and yellow curry.  My favorite:  The red curry with shrimp and pineapple.  Ohhhhhhhhhhh my mouth starts watering as soon as I place my order. I always get two entrees, so I can take home the leftovers.  MY FAVORITE DISH HERE:  The catfish.  I order \"Thai hot\" and as soon as it hits the table, my head clears up and I dig in with such zest, it's like I haven't eaten for days. I love the rice, too!  Sticky and it holds the sauces well. Finish up with the coconut ice cream.  GREAT palate-cleanser! Prices are great, or I wouldn't get the extra food to take home!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place because it has been featured on Dirty Dining more than once in the past two years.  They fail their inspections a lot.  Food is pretty good. Service mediocre. Place is never busy.  That's a sign something is wrong.  Turn around. Go home."}
{"text":"Have gone here a few times for lunch. They have a lunch menu.  Prices are a little higher than I would expect for the portions. However, the portion is just right to fill me up.  Most recently, I got the shrimp curry (not the coconut curry, the other curry).  It comes with soup, which is delicious chicken and rice with vegetables.  It also comes with 2 fried wontons (nothing inside the wonton, just the chip), and a very tiny eggroll (with tiny bit of vegetables inside, maybe it's just cabbage).  My coworker's eggroll didn't have anything inside, just the dough rolled up.  Also, comes with a small pile of rice.  Shrimp lunch special was $8.95.  Chicken was less.  The food is very flavorful. Coworkers liked their coconut shrimp lunch special. The coconut shrimp comes in a bowl with the coconut curry broth almost like a soup, rather than a gravy.  They also got coconut ice cream and liked it. It was $2.50 and was 1 scoop.    Server was very nice. We got the younger lady.  When we arrived at lunch, most of the seating was available.  There were maybe 5-6 parties there while we were there.  Tables mostly were of size 4 booths or tables. Surely tables can be scooted together for larger parties."}
{"text":"As one of the few Thai places you get frequent flyer miles in town, its as good as it gets! Cute place with great food!"}
{"text":"Touch of Thai is another great find.  The location is kind of difficult to find if you are going on Scottsdale Road because 4th Ave is not a main lighted intersection.  The restaurant has the decor feel as though I am in Thailand, but it has the classy contemporary feel of Scottsdale.  I got to say, the prices are very Scottsdale.  My only complaint is I think the food is a bit overpriced.  The food itself is exceptional and authentic.  I highly recommend the panang chicken curry.  Most panang seem to use like a peanut base, but this panang had a little different base, which I could not tell.  I have to ask the owner next time I go in.  Panang usually has a sweet and spicy combination taste.  I felt the sweet and spice, but I also felt a tangy and citrus taste to the curry.  The owner is very friendly and humble.  He seems very grateful for his customers and values customer first mentality."}
{"text":"The pad thai here is awesome!  I can't really comment on any of the other dishes.  I have only been here twice and the second time I had to get the pad thai again since it was sooo good.  The portions are very large, which can be a bummer when we come for lunch since if I take leftovers back to the office they will get stolen from the communal fridge.  I wish they would create some smaller lunch sized portions at lower prices because it really just is too much food for lunch.  The service and atmosphere are great.  Very homey.  Totally different from the other places in the area."}
{"text":"Let's start with the unpleasant stench outside before you walk in the restaurant.. I should have turned around then. I walked in to give it a fair shot and to be fair the wait staff was cheerful and kind but omg what a horrid looking room. The floors were dirty usually my first indication that I don't want to consume anything from the kitchen. The smell was also lingering inside so I politely said I changed my mind and left."}
{"text":"Stuck in a little strip mall, which seems typical for the area. Nice ambiance given that. The staff was delightful and helpful, and the panang curry was excellent, as was the Thai iced tea and the Thai tea ice cream. I would definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place four stars for the food ONLY because I've always ordered take out. Pad se ew and summer rolls are my two favorite dishes. They won me with their summer rolls.   The food is amazing, they are fast and super friendly. Service is great. Portions are a lot bigger than the other two thai restaurants I found. And it isn't pricey either. If I lived closer I'd be there every night. Haha"}
{"text":"Recently, Touch of Thai has been my go to place for Thai food. Love how spacious the restaurant is! I have ordered a few dishes such as Tom Kha Gai, Garlic Beef and Pad Thai. All of these dishes were great, especially the soup! I have yet to taste more dishes. The prices are reasonable for a couples dinner. We ordered three dishes and our grand total was $31.00. Not bad! The service is ok but the kitchen has disappointed me a few times. For example, I ordered cashew chicken and they forgot the cashews. They also don't give appropriate serving spoons. And when we asked for some they came back with teaspoons. Teaspoons? Overall, I like the place because their food is delicious. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"This little hidden gem is tucked away in a corner of a strip mall. Seemingly undistinguished from its surroundings, it hides one of the best Thai places in the area. We ordered over the phone, having gotten their menu online, and our food was ready within 15 minutes. The prices are reasonable for the portions received. The place is tastefully decorated, leaving no questions in a patrons mind as to where one is dining. Though we did not eat in, we did notice that quite a few of the tables were occupied. Always a good sign in a small restaurant such as this. The smell coming from the containers of food where intoxicating and eye watering at he same time. In true thai fashion, the main dish was spicy enough to bring pause to a lover of spicy foods, yet so delicious that I could not help but continue eating until the entire dish was consumed. The egg rolls where large and scrumptious and complimented the spicy food perfectly. Beware though, do not order it normal unless you wish for a moth burning sensation that lasts for hours. They do offer a mild version for those of us who are smart enough not to wish to burn our tongues.(I hear they offer a \"Thai spicy\" version as well, though I am not brave enough to try that yet)"}
