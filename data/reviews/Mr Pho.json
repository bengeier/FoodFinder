{"text":"Exactly what anyone needs on a cold day. Upon recommendation I had the satay noodles and it was AMAZING. I found the soup base to be extremely flavourful and FULL of ingredients. The portion size blew me away as well. A regular would compare to a large at many other pho places I have been to. Not to mention the service was great. One thing I must mention, usually after pho I feel very bloated but with Mr. Pho I felt great. No after dinner laziness or bloating which means the soup is really fresh and made with care. The only problem, I wish this place was closer to me! I will 100% be back."}
{"text":"It was amazingly BAD!  I dunno if the owner ever had pho or viet food before but they should do a research before starting a business."}
{"text":"Amazing food! You have to check this place out!! The broth is all home made with no MSG! We got the pho and it was delicious!! Prices are very affordable and the portions are huge! I found my new favourite pho place! Will def be going back :)"}
{"text":"The broth was so good. U can tell the owner made it in the store...So fresh.. very clean. And the portion is quite big and the price is comparable to others...But the broth is the best"}
{"text":"As the restaurant that we had intended to go to was closed for the day, my lunch posse wound up here. With a name like Mr. Pho, the was only one choice. Our table ended up with two house specials, a satay pho, and a vermicelli bowl.  As my pho arrived, I ate with my eyes and was looking forward (pun entirely intended) to diving in. But as the first taste of soup hit my lips, I was immediately disappointed. Lacking in complexity and flavour, I would best describe the soup as single dimensional; the addition of sriracha and hoisin bringing it to two. The texture of the noodles was \"just done\" with some obvious bite to it, but not enough to be unpleasurable. Yet credit must be given where credit is due, and so my compliments on the tripe and tendon which were cooked with authority, yielding easily with every bite.  With the smattering of positive reviews, coupled with my experience herein described, and with the plethora of alternatives in the area, I have yet to decide if I will return."}
{"text":"The satay beef soup noodle tasted spicy !! First sip of the soup made me cough because my throat was burning. When I continued to take in the second sip, the third and the fourth and on....: I could taste the different flavours in the soup. Other than satay, I tasted the sweetness of the broth and as well as the peanuts . Also I was getting used to the spicy flavour. I couldn't stop eating though my lips were burning and were swelling a little bit. I could finish the whole bowl with just the plain noodles or even just the soup. At the end of it, I drank all the soup in the bowl of noodle. It tasted awesome! Next time, I would want to come back for the Hainanese Chicken with Rice.   Besides food, the owner is also exhibiting his collection of Gundum models around the restaurant. He's happy to answer any questions about his Gundum models or just simply chat with you."}
{"text":"I randomly saw this place just opened so me and 4 of my coworkers decided to try this place. I have to say...service is like a 5 star hotel here. The owners are super polite and they are always on top of things. Extremely nice ppl..they even gave us free chicken wings to try.  The large Pho is huge!!!! I've never had such a large Pho before for like $8.99. If you're hungry this is the place to eat.  The spring rolls not the best. But the soup base is pretty good...lots of meat!  I will go back to this place again."}
{"text":"One of the best phos I've ever had! SIL and I went here for late lunch and decided to order one pad thai and a large house special beef pho to share.The server (or maybe he's the owner?) was nice enough to inform us that they serve big portions. He said it might be too much food for us so he suggested we get a regular size pho instead and if we still want more he will just give us additional pho for free. True enough, we were so full in the end we couldn't eat anymore even if we wanted to. We really appreciate the guy's honesty. Aside from that, their service was quick and place is clean. We'll be back for the large pho!"}
{"text":"Rating - 3.5/5.0  The restaurant is a bit secluded as it is located in a corner at the inner core of the plaza. It is operated by Chinese folks and upon entering the restaurant, I was immediately greeted by the owner who was quite friendly and welcoming. It had a cozy vibe inside. At the time I went in, the place was empty but a few more tables filled up later.  We got the spicy pho and the house special pho. Both had substantial amount of noodles and toppings which is a plus for those who are used to chowing down on a large bowl of pho. We got the regular size which was more than enough.   In terms of the house special, the soup base was decent. It was more on the savoury side but not too oily which is good. The beef broth was quite amped up with quite a bit of green onions and cilantro to give it a contrasting flavour and cutting through the saltiness. I liked the fact that the soup came out piping hot. Personally I prefer a slightly clearer tasting broth for pho but this was not bad. I'm sure some folks will quite like this style of broth. The beef was plentiful, silky smooth and tender which I like as most places are cut super thin and kind of rougher in texture.  In terms of the spicy soup base, I believe they added some form of chinese spicy hot oil to it, in which the taste reminded me of a spicy chinese hotpot soup base. As such, it took away the Vietnamese authenticity - but again, some folks may like this style of broth.  As my review is solely based on the pho, I would say it was decent overall in terms of the quality of toppings and portion size. In essence, it gets the job done if you're looking for some decent pho.   It is a bit out of the way for me if I want to grab a quick bite. Typically if I'm headed that direction, I would prefer to go to Shanghai Dim Sum which is just nearby the plaza. Perhaps I will visit again sometime to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Great pho place with a nice owner! We both ordered the house special pho. The broth was warm and flavourful--a good umami with sweetness. It's a really great classic bowl of pho to warm you up and fill you up! However, I will say the flavour is on par with a lot of pho restaurants you can find around the GTA. Prices are fair and it's a great place to stop by for some hearty pho. Plus, the location is pretty great because of the array of restaurants and cafes."}
{"text":"Food isn't the greatest. There are definitely many other pho places for flavour. Spring rolls have fresh bean sprout in them that are not cooked.. not sure if that's okay to eat.. but definitely did not taste good (way too much bean sprout that over powered the taste overall).  Service was relatively quick and good. Very polite and efficient. I really enjoyed the interior decor of the figurines along the walls. Definitely a unique touch up.  All in all.. I won't recommend this place for flavour."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, ordered the satay beef noodles, meat portions are plenty and the broth is rich with aroma. Spiciness of the soup is just right. My girl ordered the hainanese chicken rice, chicken is soft and tender and rice is infused with chicken flavour. Excellent service by the wait staff and food came quickly, definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Was gonna try this place out for the first time, but was politely turned away tonight because the pipe in their washroom bursted or something, the owner worried he cannot provide a pleasant environment for dinner because it \"might\" smell.    I didn't smell anything from where I was standing (almost in the middle of the restaurant), but I did appreciate this level of care and will return in the future to try out their food."}
{"text":"This review is based on my lunch experience at this new Vietnamese restaurant which opened up last week. It's a quaint little restaurant nestled at the end of a strip plaza which has plentiful parking.  Simple decor is what you first notice when you enter the restaurant.  Then the delicious smell of the beef broth  simmering in the kitchen hits your senses and you know this place is serves the real deal.  Confirmation comes when my pho is served     piping hot and packed with flavour. I was quite impressed with the generous  amount of meat and the fresh noodles they used.  I ordered their Vietnamese drop coffee over ice AND they threw in complimentary chicken wings that were enormous!   Fully satisfied at this point, I ordered their Hainanese chicken rice to go and I enjoyed that for dinner.  The portions are huge and good is priced right.  Good food is important, however service cannot be overlooked!!! The owners of this restaurant are friendly (can be humourous at times); which made my visit memorable. I will definitely be returning!!!"}
{"text":"After I having pho here, I was so thirsty and drank lots of water to make me feel better. And the soup is too greasy. No idea whether it was too salty or had MSG in it. The owner is very nice but the food is not that good and authentic. I have to say the Little Saigon is the best in the GTA area."}
{"text":"more of a 3.5 but bump up for great service.  - curry and roti 4.75 - not bad portion size, crispy roti, and I liked the curry as it was full of coconut flavour.   - house special pho regular size - bigger than average portion, broth was subtle but flavourful  - Small restaurant but decent amount of seating. There was only a few tables occupied when we went.   - Average price compared to the other pho restaurants - friendly service that gave off a homey atmosphere - Not a bad pho place... but there are better in the area"}
{"text":"We had their pho, and the soup base was watery and tasteless. Upon telling staff about how their soup lacked flavour - (saying it very nicely, not expecting anything in return, only to tell them what they are serving their customers), they started attacking us, telling us a lacklustre excuse of if we had come 30 minutes later, the soup would taste better if it was boiled longer. Essentially, they told us that it was our fault for not coming at a suitable time to have their soup at a good state. The lady there continued to say \"some people like it bland and some like it salty, I can't just add salt to the whole pot\". She completely missed the point, IT WAS THE SOUP ITSELF, THE FLAVOUR OF THE BEEF, NOT THE SALTINESS.   I would give this place 0 stars if i could. They were arguing back to us. Completely unprofessional and so rude. If your dish is not up to par, DON'T TAKE ORDERS AND PUT OUT FOOD. It is not up to the customer to just come at the perfect moment to have what they expect. Do I have to call them up and ask beforehand if their soup is good? This is a restaurant, you are supposed to be prepared for the dinner rush! Terrible service. Their response to us was absolutely disgusting and appalling. Telling all my friends and family to never go here. If you are reading this. DO NOT GO!"}
{"text":"Portions are big here! You definitely won't leave hungry! You also probably won't leave thinking that was the best viet dish you've had either.   I don't have anything bad to say about the food, but nothing too stand out either.   Haianese chicken (no rice) easily had 10-15 pieces of chicken. Much more than other places I've been.   It's a good place to come for a Vietnamese food fix. Good price. Big portion. Decent taste. Good service. Sometimes that's all you need."}
{"text":"Mr Pho deserves the name Mr.Pho. This place is a gem and I'm so mad about not knowing about this place earlier. I was craving pho so my boyfriend looked up places to go and Mr.Pho was close and had good reviews so we just went for it. The place was bit hard to find in the winter evening. I'm not familiar with the plaza itself so my boyfriend and I were like staring down each store to read the name (noobs). But the Mr.Pho is located in the corner right next to the extended parking lot section. The owner even set up his own flashing lights to light up the place in the dark!   It's a small pho place, seats about 10 tables. We came in around 6:30 on a friday and there was one other person eating. Seated and greeted immediately. We ordered the rice paper pork spring rolls, rare beef with tendon pho, and my boyfriend tried the satay beef in a spicy soup. The portions of everything is massive! Which I was really surprised about. I know pho tends to be in a big bowl but the size here really outdid itself! The regular was like a large in other places! I got the regular and my boyfriend got the large. The large was just something else.  even the spring rolls were huge! I expected the regular size ones all the other pho places give. No, these spring rolls were huge I had to use two hands to hold it to avoid any spillage! The spring rolls were packed full of stuff and it did not lack in the meat portion, everything was just right. If you like spicy definitely try the Satay Beef it's a specialty there and the owner was raving about it.   The owner himself was wonderful. He speaks perfect English and Chinese and he is willing to accommodate you in any way. You can tell he really cares about the food and wants his customers to be happy! If something says there are peanuts in it, he said he can remove it for you if you let them know ahead! He came back to fill water several times which is rare to find in a lot of restaurants nowadays (I don't know why). Even when he brought our food out he would help rearrange our table to put the food down and avoid any spillage onto our stuff. He was so considerate and sweet."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends because they were curious about the pho challenge. Upon seeing the ginormous challenge bowl sitting on their counter, we realized we were understaffed to take it on. It's massive!   We opted for their pho, satay noodles, and vermicelli. All of them came in good time and all were really good. My husband got the large bowl of pho and a small would have been more than enough. The serving sizes are pretty big. I got the vermicelli and the spring roll that came with it was really delicious; super crunchy with a pretty good filling. Our friends that got the satay noodles were also happy with their food. I was surprised to see it come out bright yellow, since I'm used to seeing reddish satay noodles, but the flavours were really good. Our waters were constantly refilled the owner served us. He was happy to talk to us about his eclectic collection of Funko Pops and Gundams that line his walks and his travels to Japan. He just seemed genuinely nice and happy to talk to people about just about anything. You don't usually see that in these kinds of restaurants."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was when they first opened. The owner helped us out with the menu and suggested I try the bun bo beef noodle. I figured might as well since that's typically what I order at any pho restaurant. First taste and I knew I needed to come back for more sooner rather than later. It was slightly different than other bun bo flavoured broths I've tried; more flavourful. It didn't taste like a soup seasoning that was pulled off a grocery store shelf.   About a year later, (shame on me for not coming back sooner) I'm returning for lunch. They've come out with a pho challenge! $50, 50mins, 6lbs of noodles and meat. Finish it all by yourself and the bowl of noodles is free and you get a $100 gift card for the restaurant.  This visit, I ordered the same bun bo beef noodles! The broth was a little different from my first visit; it had lost the unique flavour I thought I had picked out the first time. BUT, it's not a complaint. It was still delicious and satisfied my pho craving. The two pieces of pork hock was SO tender, fall off the bone. Didn't even know pork hock could be so tender.  I also got to try my friend's satay broth. Delicious! Peanuty, slightly coconut, with a touch of sweetness.   I always seem to think of Mr. Pho first when I'm craving. Will definitely be back soon. Hopefully not another year later."}
{"text":"Came here because it just newly opened and I was surprisingly not disappointed. Lots of pho places in Richmondhill/Markham are less than average. Coming originally from North York where there are a bunch Vietnamese owned Pho places, I do know what a good bowl of pho taste. I didn't have the common beef rice noodle (since I'm accustomed to my mother's), but I had their grilled chicken w/rice, spring rolls and their special Thai rice noodle soup. Their large size for noodles are huge and very generous with toppings and noodles. It was only $11 and it can honestly feed two people. The taste was very flavourful, meat was tender and noodles were of good quality. My rice didn't look appealing at first, but honestly, the spring roll and chicken that came with was pretty good so I'm not complaining. I can tell that the chef makes sure that each dish will be flavourful. Will be back to try other items on the menu! The one star less is because for the price of the rice dish, you would get a steamed egg or shrimp cane or shredded pork along with it."}
{"text":"Booked this place 2 days in advance wanting to share the pho challenge with the huge bowl of 6 lbs of beef and noodles...this was somewhat interesting as I think this is the only markham/richmond hill location that had something in this range...  So our plans changed and we had only 3 adults with 2 kids...when the owner saw us, he indicated that he wasn't gonna sell it to us which was a bummer to us..that's the main reason we came...it was #instafood  worthy...we were willing to pay, I mean we could have just taken the remaining away...but that wasn't an option...   So we just ended just ordering the regular size pho, a curry one as recommended by the owner...and the spring rolls...   The beef broth was average not that bold, I think probably becuz of not much msg, that's a +0.5   The portions were smaller than the other average pho places...-0.5 ....  anyhow, if you come for the pho challenge, it should be an interesting experience and I'm sure the broth is the same...an average pho place..."}
{"text":"When they first opened, the portions were huge. Lots of beef, noodles, and soup. Because of this, my boyfriend and I decided to share a large pho with wings and spring rolls. All the noodles and meat fit in the two side bowls after one serving, so we decided to get the XL instead the following week. Even with the XL - it was just a huge bowl with lots of soup and everything fit into the same 2 side bowls yet again. That was very disappointing.  This is run by Chinese - not Viet -  but they make it pretty well. The soup is good and doesn't make you feel thirsty afterwards. The fried spring rolls aren't the typical ones from the viet restaurants- they use a different wrapping?   The owner is really nice... however sort of defensive. I took a sip of my viet iced milk coffee and told my boyfriend it didn't taste right (it came in that drip coffee and everything). Then the owner heard me and came over and asked if I wanted one remade which was nice, but starts explaining that the reason might be because the coffee might have had too much water? I wanted to tell him that it's because I don't taste the condense milk- it tasted like it was mixed with milk and sugar but I didn't get a chance to speak, and I didn't want another coffee.   He gave us 10% off. This place gets the job done if you can't find anywhere else but it's not \"authentic\" and there's definitely way more soup than noodles and beef."}
{"text":"I'm not Vietnamese so I don't know what's authentic or not, but what I had was pretty darn tasty and the serving was very generous.  The small is probably equivalent to a large elsewhere IMO however price wise, it's also closer to a large elsewhere.  Our table of 3 decided to try 3 different types of soup base - Original, Thai style and Satay.  They were all very good.  My favourite could possibly be the Thai style.  It's a tom yum type soup base and it yummy with pho noodles.  No extra hoisin and sriracha sauce required.  Service was great too.  The waiter (possibly the owner) was checking on us often to make sure everything is up to par.  The basil leaves and bean sprouts were so fresh too.  I'll be back for sure because I've been eyeing the bowl of vermicelli at the table next to us."}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you. It doesn't look like much but this restaurant has the cleanest kitchen, this small PHO place is a gem on HWY 7 and the most delicious Beef Bone Soup base ever tasted the food is next to die for just like being back home in Vietnam...Located at 360 Hwy 7.  This is one of Ontario best kept secrets."}
{"text":"Just moved in around the area and was looking for my go to pho place and i think i found it! The place is rather small but other than that, great experience! Large portions, prefect soup, very kind, friendly and fast service! Would highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately on our recent visits, the food was not as good. Also the portions are smaller."}
{"text":"I was craving pho over the weekend and my dad decided to try this new place.  It was GREAT!!  The service here was quick as expected with most vietnamese restaurants.  I ordered the house special noodles ($10.25 for the large bowl).  The soup was flavourful but not overpowering.  It was a generous portion of meat and noodles, which kept me full for the full day.  I got the spring rolls, which were good, crispy and fresh.  I will be coming here for my future pho cravings."}
{"text":"I had no clue this place opened until I found it on Yelp. I was just at this same location a few weeks ago for papa chang.  The layout and decor is basically the same, wooden decor with a tv in the back. I would estimate the place can have max 35 people.  The menu seems to lean a bit more towards Vietnamese food with a fusion twist of Chinese. I can't say it's the most authentic I had, but it's tasty in its own way.  There are the traditional pho dishes, which was lacking a bit in flavor. It was missing that star anise flavor. There are also a variety of appetizers, fried rice, vermicelli to name a few. We tried the roti and it was quite tasty. A bit oily, but generally light and flaky, with a bit of curry and pickled veggies.  While the pho seemed to lack a bit of flavor, it was still very decent, portion size was also very generous and they didn't skimp on the meat. It was very satisfying over all.  My other half got a satay curry based soup, which had a nice after taste of coconut.  The service and people were very friendly, welcoming and chatty. Food came out quick and hot, decently tasty with good portion sizes, and a fair price (starts at $8.50).  Tough to fault a place that is fairly priced, decently tasty with generous portions.  This place is a welcome addition to the local noodle scene.  Only negative is its in the very back corner of the plaza. From hwy 7 you would see yoga tree and a hot pot place before seeing this place.   Definitely worth a try, can't really go wrong overall"}
{"text":"This is an aging restaurant in Markham. When we arrived we were directed to sit anywhere by a woman seated at a table with bunches of bananas  and playing games on her phone. The table was sticky and the restaurant was half full on a Saturday at 630. Perhaps more of a lunch place?  I ordered the vermicelli which was thicker, more like spaghetti. The grilled meats were good but otherwise I had trouble eating this and I gave up half way.  I had a taste of the pho broth and it was absolutely delicious. On a cooler day it would be my choice for this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was debating between a 3 or 4 stars review, it might be closer to a 3.5 - it has decent and savoury pho to satisfy my cravings with friendly service.  For 3 people, we ordered a large pho, a chicken vermicelli (Mong) and chicken wings. We were warned that the large pho is huge, and no kidding... it was HUGE, they're very generous with the portions even the beef (which usually gets skimped). The beef broth is not light and comes in a darker tone. I liked it but for my mom, she thought it was kind of heavy and a bit salty - so it's personal preference? The noodles were chewy, and the beef was good. They know how to make a good pho!  Although the menu has 'set' pho combinations, the waiter told us to let him know of the desired combination and it can be done. No extra charge!  The chicken vermicelli came with a spring roll which was extremely crispy! Again, the portion was really generous, almost spilling out of the bowl it come in.  The chicken wings were standard fried wings, but no flavouring... when it was supposed to be Vietnamese style wings. It came in a basket of 5wings for $6.25 which I do not think it's worth...  All and all, would I come back? Yes, since I always have a pho craving!"}
{"text":"So I came back to this restaurant several times after my initial review and have now bumped it from a 4 star to 2 star.  Reason? Well.. I've had the bun bo hue twice and the thai style house special beef noodle soup twice and I have realized that these soups are a hit or miss! I've had one great experience with each..then the next the soup will be extremely spicy or extremely oily...  I also ordered the roti & curry sauce and it was extremely pathetic. The roti was two paper-thin pieces of (probably) frozen and purchased at T&T roti... it was very bland and...SMALL. The curry was even sadder... it was in the size of those soy sauce/ketchup dishes.. and it was really, really salty. For just over $5 I expected something half decent.. or maybe at least a bigger (less concentrated) portion of curry sauce?  I think I've tried this place enough for a fair review and sadly will not be returning."}
{"text":"Okay Mr. Pho should be renamed \" Pho King Huge!\" as the portions are really big even though the place is really tiny.  Decided to try this place as we were in the area and was greeted by the owner who was very welcoming and accommodating... already a great sign.  The portions of pho, vermicelli, rice and appetizers are really on the big size here.  Big bowls with big amounts of protien, noodles and rice.  Taste wise we all really enjoyed our meal.  I agree that this might not be authentic Vietnamese but to be honest there were some really good tweaks to the food such as the pickled veggies with the rice and a more savoury flavour to the broth.  I can definitely see ourselves coming back and making this our go to pho place in the area.    Pho king well done Mr. Pho! ...Pho king well done!!!"}
{"text":"Located at the end unit in the same plaza and on the same side as Yoga Tree, Mr. Pho is a small, homey restaurant serving up some delicious Vietnamese food packed with huge (spicy) flavours, and it is the Home of the 50-minute Pho Challenge of 6 lbs House Special Pho! When you are here, get ready for a pho chow down!  Note: There are plenty of parking spots at the back when you drive past the restaurant. The front can get a bit chaotic at times lol.  This local spot first attracted me NOT because of the Pho Challenge but for the recommendation of the Bun Bo Hue aka Vietnamese Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, and the hubby REALLY wants to come try. I'm not exactly a fan of spicy food, but the picky hubby seemed to have really enjoyed it, so it is definitely a pass :) The Vietnamese style cold coffee was also very, very good... but it certainly does takes time to make. WARNING: You may expect the coffee to come after your meal.  The food IMO are delicious and very satisfying. Other than pho and vermicelli, I also love all rice dishes at a pho restaurant lol. My favourite dish at Mr. Pho is the Hainanese Chicken Rice! The flavoured rice is delicious and not oily, and the chicken is tender and juicy. I would order this again!  The service from the owner is always warm, friendly and welcoming :) Definitely points right there! The owner must also be an anime/manga fanatic because of all the beautiful collector figurines displayed in the restaurant! They are not for sale (We asked lol) There are even some creative DIYs, and they look really awesome... I especially love the Goku holding up the bowl of pho lol.  Overall, a good local spot to grab some pho! Challenge to finish the 6 lbs. House Special pho under 50 minutes by yourself, and it is on the house (value $50)! You will also receive a $100 Mr. Pho restaurant gift voucher for completion! Who is up for the challenge?"}
{"text":"I've been to this pho restaurant a bunch of times and keep coming back here for 3 reasons:  1. Their huge portion sizes! A regular sized bowl looks like a large, and a large looks like the biggest bowl of pho you've ever seen! (This isn't true though, they have a 6lbs bowl that's larger than me... eat it under 50 mins and it's free!) They also have an xlarge size too but i'm not sure how big it is.   2. Soup broth! I usually drink the soup broth that comes with the beef brisket pho. While most if not all broths are super salty, I find this one to be much less salty and more flavourful. Their brisket is super tender and not too fatty as well.   3. The owner! He's a super friendly guy that really does care about his customers. On our first visit to the restaurant, we were interested in the pho challenge so he came over and described it and even showed us photos on his phone. Super charismatic.   Overall, I'd say this is definitely one of the better pho places in town."}
{"text":"I came here with my family during lunch time and there were quite a few tables occupied. We were nicely greeted by the manager of the restaurant who really knew how to joke/make my parents happy. Portion sizes here are quite big and the prices are reasonable.  My dad ordered the Pho which he said the soup was flavourful, and the noodles were good. However, he said the beef was not tender. My brother-in-law got the House Special Pho which comes with way more beef and other cuts and he really liked it.  I shared the Chicken and Pork with Rice and the Vermicelli with Pork. The flavours were actually quite decent/satisfactory, but I thought the presentation of both dishes was lacking (not enough pickled carrots, cucumbers, etc). I also found that the Chicken+Pork in the rice dish was TOO salty (and it kinda had that \"glaze\"/oily colour on it, kinda like that colour you get when you go korean BBQ and you haven't changed the grill in awhile, you know what I mean?!).  The vermicelli with pork had plenty of meat and noodles, but I felt it was lacking some veggies.  I also didn't like the wrapper the spring rolls were made with; they used the \"smooth\" kind that you find in Dim Sum Spring rolls (instead of the bumpy ones that I normally see at Vietnamese restaurants), although the filling was more traditional.   Overall, portions were big, price was reasonable, my family loved it -- but I feel I've had better and more authentic Vietnamese food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Great service. Fresh food. I would say that although the owners are Chinese they do a great job. Portions are very large. I would say that it's the best in this area. I love the Pho, rolls and the roast lemongrass pork with vermicelli."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a chinese-vietnamese fusion style restaurant, look no further! Mr. Pho offers a variety of high quality dishes for a decent price. Best of all, the portions are HUGE! I didn't think I'd ever go to a restaurant and complain that there was too much food; clearly I was wrong. This is now my go-to place to satisfy my Pho cravings :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened recently and I think they are relying heavily on word of mouth advertising so thought I would write them a review after my first visit which was enjoyable. I came to try the satay beef noodle which was really good! I am usually disappointed by the satay beef noodle at most Pho places, but this broth was the perfect intensity and had slight coconut milk and peanut flavour which was not too overpowering. The beef was also quite tender. The owner was really friendly and asked for my feedback on the food, and he even gave me a candy that he said was good to cleanse my palate after having the satay soup. Will come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"It's place to enjoy authentic pho.  Friendly and kind hospitality made good impression.  Feels like this is hidden gem."}
{"text":"Finally to try this \"Sound Hot\" Pho, hahaha! The server is funny, he understands what customers want and also made my parents laugh;) I ordered their Satay style and hear it cook with bone soup, my parents ordered Pad Thai is BIG ITEM for share! Happy Friday guys"}
{"text":"Nice staff but subpar food. Pho tasted off, vermicelli (bun) was meh, and roti was frozen and not fresh."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Mr Pho ever since I saw their pho challenge. Of course, I wasn't going for the challenge itself but I thought that it was something that made them stand out from other pho restaurants in the area.   I came after work for an early dinner (5:30pm) so it was mostly empty. 4 of us ordered a couple of dishes to share:  Roti & Curry - This appetizer was the first dish to arrive. It comes with two pieces of roti and a small sauce dish of curry. The roti was deliciously warm and crispy. At first, I thought there's no way that they gave us enough curry for two pieces of roti. However, the curry is quite spicy. You don't need a lot so it ended up being the perfect amount.   Satay Beef Noodles - We ordered this because the owner (I assume he's the owner) was bringing this dish out to the table next to us and told us that this was their most popular and signature dish. Some of my co-workers said that this was spicier than the curry. I personally did not find this dish spicy and actually thought the broth had a nice and creamy taste. It came with a good portion of beef - more than I thought! The noodles were soft absorbed the taste of the broth.   Hainan Chicken on Rice - I normally don't order this on my own accord regardless of where I am - it's not a dish that really interests me. However, after trying it here, I can see myself ordering it again and even trying it at other restaurants. It smelled so good when he put it on our table. The chicken was so soft and had lots of meat. Every bit of the rice was very well-flavoured.  The owner (again, assuming he is the owner) had great customer service. He was very engaged in conversation with the table next to us and with our group as well. I would 100% recommend and will be returning in the near future."}
