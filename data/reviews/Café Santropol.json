{"text":"excellent offbeat sandwiches and original home made soup.  i never thought cream cheese could be used in so many different ways, with so many different accompanying flavors. i was VERY skeptical when i first saw the menu, but have been more than satisfied with everything i've ever ordered here.  there is a great backyard patio which is open during the summers. best of all, this place is a stone's through from the mountain, and we all know that nature + tasty sandwich = best thing ever."}
{"text":"Huge fan, delicious, wonderful environment. Once my friend commented that she liked one of the cow mugs and asked where should could get one. The manager gave her one! Service isn't always the fastest but they also don't mind if you stick around for a while after your meal."}
{"text":"Une des plus belles terrasse avec verdure et vue sur le Mont-royal. Le meilleur gâteau aux carottes à Montréal que j'ai dégusté avec plaisir! Les sandwichs, avec leur pain pumnickel fait maison, sont décadents! Ambiance relax et chaleureuse avec un bon service. Un endroit à inscrire dans votre carnet d'adresse pour les meilleurs cafés avec terrasse!  Note : J'aimerais bien qu'ils ajoutent sur leur menu: smooties et jus pressé fait maison."}
{"text":"(THIS REVIEW ALSO CONTAINS SEVERAL PHOTOS!)  Located on the corner of St. Urbain & Duluth, in a converted multi-story red brick former apartment building, Santropol is painted with very distinctive pale green and purplish-blue trim that makes it stand out in the neighbourhood. The interior decor is also quite eclectic, including some old-fashioned stamped tin ceilings, a step-down front section with large windows, cozy booths, and an assortment of paintings and wall sculptures.  During the warmer months, their private fenced-in backyard terrasse is a lush garden oasis, complete with full-size trees, a small waterfall and fish pond. At night, it's gently lit with patio lighting and overhead string lights to give a warm and pleasant atmosphere. On Sundays during the summer, you can often hear the distant sounds of drums from the weekly Tam-Tams on the side of nearby Mount-Royal.  The bilingual menus are very veg-friendly, with very large and hearty sandwiches made with Santropol's own dark and thickly sliced bread. Many of the selections lean heavily on the cream cheese, so read the menu carefully if it's not one of your favourites. They often have a selection of two soups of the day; on our most recent visit, I choose the Beef & Barley and was quite pleased with it's belly-warming effect on such a chilly winter evening. During the weekdays, you can substitute half of your sandwich for a soup.  One of my favourite choices is the Minted Ham Sandwich, with ham, cucumbers, thinly sliced apples and sweet mint jelly, served with a light side salad. My dinner companion choose something new for himself, the Mango Madness, with thick cream cheese, sweet and spicy mango and lettuce, with a side salad, which he enjoyed very much.  Santropol offers a nice selection of coffees, teas and other beverages, as well as some delightful milkshakes, available in a multitude of flavours. Their desserts are also quite nice.   Santropol has free WiFi (courtesy of Ile-sans-fils), which makes it a great place to bring your laptop, catch up on email or other web-related work. The wait staff don't rush the customers, which is a refreshing change from some other cafés that I've been to in Montreal. You'll often see customers working on their laptops, reading the various local indie papers, writing in their journals or even sketching in their art pads. A lovely way to spend the afternoon, either alone or with friends...  All told, Santropol is a true Montreal tradition; one that has both ex-pats and locals returning year after year!"}
{"text":"This place is a piece of Heaven! One of the best garden terraces in the city - you can sit there all afternoon under the shade by the pond drinking coffee and eating their unusual sandwiches. Great atmosphere, a Montreal staple in every way! Will not disappoint locals and tourists alike."}
{"text":"Really don't see the hype. Cream cheese on everything. Been here a few times and always been disappointed with the service. Last time I went here with a table of three, the waitress finished her shift and didn't pass our order onto kitchen or next waitress. Waited for a while before we asked. The food didn't make up for the service."}
{"text":"Got a take out sandwich one night there.  Not much interaction with the servers, but they were above average for montreal.   The bread they use is definitely worth a try, and most sandwiches come with a small side salad. For the money ~$10 or maybe a bit less for an average sandwich, it was well prepared and tasty.   I would recommend trying at least once. They have good lighter options, as well as vegan dishes."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and great tasting. The service could have been more welcoming but the food experience was very positive!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, friendly staff, delicious food. What more could you ask for? The garden at the rear of the cafe is gorgeous during the summer. You can also tell that the people who work there genuinely love being there. I can't rave about this place enough."}
{"text":"We would have never found this little hidden gem near the park Mont Royal had it not been for the Lonely Planet!  All the reviews are right, this place rocks, the food is incredible and the coffee drinks (or all the drinks for that matter) looked amazing.  However the service was too slow and I did not get my coffee and biscotti :( Oh well.  I did have the mango madness with chicken salad and when it arrived I was like oh no way can I eat this whole thing but I surely did!  The bread as others have said is the softest, biggest and freshest you will lay your hands on.  Only drawbacks were the girls sitting behind us who had the most annoying laughs ever and the slow service.  On the other hand, the vibe is chill and low key and the patio is pretty fab."}
{"text":"This place should be called Barfe Santropoo. The food was awful... Way more cream cheese than necessary on both mine and my sister's sandwich. Thinking about it makes me want to puke. Also, the service was lame... Inattentive, slow, and impersonal. I have no idea what the hype was about... The place was packed. We headed back to the hotel afterwards cuz our stomachs ached. Big thumbs down."}
{"text":"Santropol was one of the places I would routinely take visiting friends when I lived in Montreal, sometimes as a kind of counterpoint to Schwartz's. The atmosphere at Santropol is laid-back without trying too hard, and the interior has its own homey charm, so that it's worth visiting even when the huge and lush rear patio is closed during the winter.  I'm not a big fan of vegetarian dishes, but I never had a sandwich from Santropol that wasn't totally satisfying. They're always big, fresh, and fill you right up; the fillings, based on cream cheese but flavoured in various different ways with vegetable purees and spices, are delicious and definitely not boring."}
{"text":"The food is great and they have affordable prices. The ambiance is very cozy. The only thing that I'm not crazy about is the service. The service staff is pretty slow and don't seem to be happy to be there.  Very vegetarian and vegan friendly."}
{"text":"Really tasty sandwiches and friendly staff.  The sandwich options are a bit wild, but it helps me explore.  They are also super healthy, but still tasty.  These sandwiches are big though, so be sure you have the knife and fork ready."}
{"text":"The Killer Tomato Sandwich is to die for!  Enough said.  It's cream cheese heaven (with tomatoes).  The waiter was really nice too! :)  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"J'adore cette place!!!! C'est ma place préférée pour leurs sandwichs gourmets et leurs milkshakes! Le staff est généralement très chill, l'atmosphère est très bien pour toutes sortes de rencontre (entre amis, couples, pour étudier, ou juste pour prendre quelquechose à manger et boire tout seul!) Très recommandé!!"}
{"text":"nah! not again. If you love cream cheese and I mean really really love it ...will loads of it , between two slice of bread with totally bland toppings..then this is the place to go...   Expensive it is, they charge extra for cucumber on a vege-sandwich! and bland it is..But thumps up for cheese ...this is a cheese lovers haven! I would say the bread comes in between the cheese...not the other way around.  I know I know everyone is raving about the backyard patio...just walk down a street and there is mount royale gardens...enjoy the sun and seriously get a sandwich from one of the several shop on St.Laurent..  Service: Yeah, hope u are lucky to get the guy in glasses who is really good (probably because he is part-owner) or else others seem really overworked and long faced."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is healthy and extremely delicious! It's original too, what's on the menu here, you really can't find anywhere else. Sandwiches seem simple until you read the interesting \"put together\" of ingredients.   You can almost TASTE the grand effort put into making each sandwich, salad, soup...whatever it may be! The ambiance is fantastic. It's the perfect to take your friend from out of town. Santropol does a great job showing just how \"cool\" Montreal can be."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches. Maybe a BIT too much cream cheese sometimes, but still delicious (sidenote: not sure why people think these sandwiches are so healthy?? when did cream cheese become healthy??).  Personal favourite is the Killer Tomato (!!!!!). Also a fan of Pepper Island and the classic Santropol. Tried the Sweet Root once, and felt like I was just eating a bunch of carrots between some bread, so won't be getting that one again. That said, if you're a vegan, or a rabbit, or a vegan rabbit, this could be a great option for you.  Love the ambience, inside and out. Great place to come for lunch with a small group of friends, à deux, or solo.  Fair warning: Service is consistent. By that, I mean that they are consistently friendly, but they are also consistently slow and will consistently forget your order."}
{"text":"Aller sur la terrasse intérieure , ça vaut le coup ."}
{"text":"Went there last week for the first time and it was absolutely awesome.  The food, the ambiance with the lights in the garden, the delicious floats called \"sodas\" and their delicious sandwiches.  It was all great especially since we had people visiting from outside of the country who wanted to try something cool in Montreal. Def going back."}
{"text":"Cafe Santropol is quite accurately epitomized by the inner contradictions of the bougie bohemian faux-poor middle class plateau kids that make up its clientele. It tries to look cute with its wooden-y interior featuring random shit on the walls, and crappy old chairs, and it tries to promote green stuff that sounds remotely activisty with its organic coffee and huge sandwiches that taste like the earth and are heaped with vegetables, but none of these things can hide the the basic truth about Santropol cafe: its food is bland and SO overpriced.   Everytime I have been dragged here by some vegetarian or bike-riding friend of a friend I have been disappointed and ultimately just felt like I would have been better off eating fucking mcdonalds. At least my wallet wouldn't have felt pillaged. Not only was the food at best sub-par, but the service here is some of the most charmless and lazy that I have experience in Montreal - and to single out a place in that city for being the absolute worst is no small comment, which I'm sure anyone who lives there understands.   My big beef with santropol is that it has to pick an aesthetic. Either it can improve its service and the flavour of its food and keep its price point, or remain a lazy alright-tasting hippy joint but make its menu appropriately cheap. Right now it's just a bum pissing in an alleyway wearing a chinchilla fur coat. wtf."}
{"text":"Super relaxed atmosphere, and delicious food, what more can you ask for? My friends and I had dinner there and gabbed for hours without any pressure to move it along. Was not super busy on a weeknight, but it's always nice to have great service (refilling of water) even after all the main meal is consumed. Everything we tried was super tasty (both soups of the day -- a tomato soup, and a creamy squash soup, Northern lights sandwich, pepper island sandwich, chocolate cheesecake and carrot cake) and very generous portions. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"You would be a mad mad mad half insane half crazy fool of a boob to not eat here if you like sandwiches. Hell, even if you don't like sandwiches you should be eating here because the food is that good.  The vibe is below low key and you might accidentally write a poem or sonnet while you blissfully day dream about fresh baked bread and the goodness that will appear between those slices of heaven. Fear not though because you will be in good company and there are plenty of books to steer you around any writer's blocks you may encounter. If that doesn't help, have a drink or three. The ice cream sodas are wonderful as are their desert coffees.  You will find numerous little odds and ends hiding in every nook and cranny of the back room. From harlequins playing the lute to monkeys in ancient diving helmets playing the stand up bass, there is something for everyone's visual cortex to ponder endlessly.  I was lucky enough to get my chops on the jambon a la menthe. Fresh ham with cucumber, mint jelly and apples. So, so good.  Go! Go now I say!"}
{"text":"S'il y a bien un endroit à ne pas manquer sur le plateau Mont-Royal, un endroit où l'on se sent chez-soi, autant pour prendre un double allongé que pour se repaître copieusement, c'est bien ce café excentrique, hétéroclite, bariolé, qui offre comme nulle part ailleurs de gargantuesques sandwichs extravagants (plus de dix sortes). Le menu est truffé de mixtes audacieux d'ingrédients (les fruits ont une prédominance) qui à notre grande surprise, créent des découvertes gustatives aussi délicieuses que farfelues...   Le choix de sandwich est imposant et vous laissera pantois. La tartinade est l'atout. L'Aurore Boréal, par exemple, est un sandwich dans lequel l'on y retrouve une tartinade de fromage à la crème aux olives épicées, saupoudrée de pacanes rôties, et l'on peut y ajouter du jambon... Tout simplement jouissif. Autre exemple :  la Tomate meurtrière comprend une tartinade de fromage à la crème aux tomates séchées, basilic et ail, garni de tranches de tomates fraîches. Suffisant pour ouvrir l'appétit. Servies par un personnel jovial et à l'aise, les assiettes sont énormes, toujours accompagnées de légumes et fruits frais, et peuvent être combinées à la soupe du jour. Rien de plus réconfortant en hiver... Desserts gourmands, lait fouetté, jus de fruits, légumes, épices...cet endroit veut nous faire plaisir.  Le Santropol a le mérite d'être parmi les premiers commerces à avoir introduit du café bio-équitable sur l'île de Montréal. La torréfaction maison est variée et de qualité. Les caféïnomanes en trouveront pour leur compte; du café sous toutes ses formes. L'on peut même en acheter sur place.  L'espresso est légèrement chocolaté, et dégage une odeur grillée.  Avis aux lecteurs sereins : salle de lecture et somptueux jardin-terrasse, très prisé durant l'été et le début de l'automne.  Clin d'il : si vous avez de la chance, l'on pourra vous vendre leur pain maison, genre de pain pumpernickel (brun-noir, fait avec de la farine et grain de seigle)"}
{"text":"It's good sandwiches but they won't change your life.  I think its a Montreal institution and the garden is cute."}
{"text":"the place is so cute - such a hidden gem! bagels were alright, nothing special about it (too much cream on top).   but atmosphere is almost mystical and i love the decoration there.   i really enjoyed sitting down for a brunch in this lovely place.  the owner is really hilarious and very friendly. =)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has only 3.5 stars. Went there today since it was right besides where I was staying and ordered a sandwich & a latte. (The latte was really good, strong favor and they garnished it w/ a strawberry) I later found out that they roast their coffee bean locally.   The sandwich was delicious and big and has a lot of cream cheese (which not everybody like but I do)..I could only finish half and have to box their other half. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients, and o they made their own break as well, which is pretty awesome.   All their ingredients are organic and they have vegan options as well. The wifi was free. There's also outdoor sitting at the back but I didn't go there since it was raining."}
{"text":"I totally agree with Luke and Ari S. but while he doesn't like the ginormous bread, I do.  And although I dislike cream cheese, I long ago learned that I could ask for food without the things I'm not fond of.  Excellent place to walk down to after a walk in the park."}
{"text":"Am a big fan of this socially conscious restaurant.  Check out their garden out back, as them about their meals on wheels program.  Very cool.  Great sandwiches, but like others have said, you gotta like the bread -- and cream cheese, but you can get hummus instead, and they pile on the veggies/meat.  Cute, comfy interior, and excellent coffee.  Please check it out if you are going to the park."}
{"text":"One of Montreal's hidden gems of a cafe, Santropol is a hidden garden of Eden with a flowing coy pond, cozy mismatched chair & table sets and delicious food (mostly vegetarian with meat addition options). I ate the northern lights sandwich which was absolutely delicious (enough to share with someone else with a small appetite). My mother ate a special of the day which was a quinoa salad (see my photo). Unfortunately my brother got sting by a bee but the staff was extremely courteous and helpful which showed a lot about the character of this small cafe. Even though the main attraction is the little oasis in the back, the inside seating area is well established and charmingly decorated. Next time I can't wait to try some of their delicious looking smoothies/drinks"}
{"text":"Love this place, always have.   Giant sandwiches with  fresh bread.    They use alot of dairy products in their 'special' sandwiches.   I really love them all.  They also have a few safe bets such as chicken salad, veggie pate, etc.    The coffee is good too and they are known for their house teas.   This place has a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Big facts: this place slaps. The waitstuff is beyond friendly; the atmosphere and general layout of the restaurant is beautiful; and most of all, the food was absolutely delicious. I purchased the Santropol as a meal, the borsch as an appetizer, and a ginger kombucha for a drink(however I tried many other dishes via my friends). I was absolutely blown away! The food was not the best I have ever eaten, but if you are looking for a dinner you won't forget, check out Cafe Santropol!"}
{"text":"A Montreal Plateau classic. I recommend the Killer Tomato or chili."}
{"text":"As the other reviews highlight: 1). The sandwiches are giant; delicious fresh bread, with innovatively solid spreads and fillings, and garnished with slices of oranges or melons, which is lovely.  The cherry on the cake, so to say. 2). The coffee and desserts are well-done as well. 3). The clientele is hip.  This is a plus for some, and a minus for others. 4). The interior is homey and eclectic; the garden seating area is a heavenly place in the summer.  Definitely worth a visit for 1)."}
{"text":"So glad I finally checked this place out!  The interior of the cafe is filled with the heavenly aroma of bread, but my friends and I opted to sit in the outdoor garden, wanting to take advantage of the fleeing warm weather.  It was a slightly chilly day, but there were heaters and also blankets available. The outdoor garden is beautiful and cozy, and includes a small pond (with fish!) as well as a super colorful and gorgeous hammock. I can just imagine coming here on a hot summer day, sipping on some coffee and reading a book, and relaxing in the hammock - seems like a perfect escape for a day! The servers were very friendly and helpful with recommendations. The food is super delicious as well. I got the half and half special, so I got half of the Chaucer sandwich (tofu) and a bowl of rutabaga honey soup, and both were really good. I also tried my friend's sandwich, the Duluth, which was very tasty as well. The sandwich bread, in particular, is really good.   They also have free wifi, so it'd be a good place to get some work done as well!"}
{"text":"One of the best spots I found in Montreal! Sandwiches are great. I sat in a nice little reading spot at the front but the yard looked really lovely too! Friendly service, Will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Amazing place with cute, quaint, and charming decoration. Friendly staff with good service. The food portions are large and very tasty, with some unique choices."}
{"text":"So, I was in Montreal for the week for a conference and this restaurant was right by where we were staying.  We saw the patio and thought it was so cute.  We kept walking past it every day and on our last night there we decided to try it and I am so glad we did.   First, the restaurant is deceptively large.  It is much bigger than it looks from the outside. There is plenty of seating inside, but the patio is gorgeous on a summers night and I highly recommend sitting out there if it is available.   They have a full coffee/tea/espresso bar.  We had several in our party get lattes which they were happy with.  We had a couple of lemonades and two chai.  Neither of us were impressed with the chai.  It seemed bland, almost watered down.   The restaurant serves a variety of soups, salads and sandwiches.  We shared a vegetarian chili which was a large portion and had great flavor.  The sandwiches and salads are all vegetarian friendly, but if you are a meat eater like me you can add ham to your sandwich.  I had the mango madness and it was out of this world.  It had ham, cream cheese, and spicy mango chutney on this beautiful brown bread.  The sandwich came with a small salad, but the sandwich was quite large and delicious, so I ate most of the sandwich and decided to forgo the salad.   We also sampled a few desserts including a raspberry cheesecake and key lime tart, both of which were awesome.   If I am ever in Montreal again I will likely return."}
{"text":"The patio is great for hanging out.  its lit with Christmas lights and has a garden with a small fountain.    this place is adorable.  Get the Killer Tomato, the Duluth, or the Santropol.  Those are my favorite sandwiches.  These three sandwiches are super cheesy - which is my first love.  Keep in mind i like my cream cheese to be almost as thick as my bagel for breakfast...   But if you are not into that, a good call is to share 2 different sandwiches between 2 people...  :)  The hippy waiters and staff are really chill, but sometimes you may end up waiting a while to be served.  But i guess that's the vibe of the place.  Just hang out and enjoy the garden or even the coziness of the inside.  :D"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge sandwich person but I always love a sandwich from Cafe Santropol! Huge portions (I'm always full), soft house-made bread, delicious cream cheese options (just enough) and never dry! They have really flavorful soup as well as Chai Latte (light and spicy and just right). I highly recommend, especially for the special patio experience :)"}
{"text":"What a special place! The sandwiches are fresh and very good, they are also huge, I couldn't finish mine. The staff is friendly, I did order a lemonade that never got to my table, but Hey... We all make mistakes. The coffee is good.   The garden is special, so zen and beautifully arranged. Lots of shade for a hot day.  The prices are fair. They are also kid friendly, offering the option of a high chair for the little ones."}
{"text":"I've known about this place for a lil while because of my good friend Sara - we tried to go there once and unfortunately found that is was closed.  Well finally went back today and it was one of the loveliest places i've ever been in the city. The Plateau has many gems and this is definitely one that stands out. The Cafe is in a little building - well a house converted into a cafe !   The decoration is a mix of vintage & eclectic style - Très a mon goût ! There are many different sitting areas and all the way in the back , theres a magical garden ( yes magical!)  filled with green vegetations, trees and even a little pond. A place where ( in the summer time of course)  you could spend all your mornings - afternoons & evenings ( all day, errrydayyy)  just reading a book, enjoying nature or delighting in philosophical convo's about life. That little magical place even lits up at night to resemble a fairy's den  - or what i imagine a fairy's den would look like if it existed.  Unfortunately we didn't eat any meals there - only a drink and some ice cream. I had an iced coffee late with a hint of mint ( which i asked for) and my friend had vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup and fruits. We thoroughly enjoyed our drink and food and shall go back to sample the main meals and/or entrees.  *Bonus This place sells books for 3$ - which, being a book lover pretty much sealed the deal for me - of course i purchased a book by Albert Camus - & only that one because i didn't have any more change than 3$. Last little amazing surprise , My friend stumbled upon a game of psychology, where you get to ask random behavioural questions - the type that answer to ''what would you do if'' . My friend and i promised to gather up a group of friends and head back there just for that game.  Go there for a date, go there for lunch, go there to spend some time solo, go there with friends...but just go or you will be missing out on this beautiful little gem of a Cafe.  Santropol, i just want to say :  thank you , i love you , your amazing."}
{"text":"This was the first vegetarian-friendly restaurant I ever ate at. The idea of eating differently from how I was raised simply never really occurred to me until I got to university. Everyone and their dog was a vegetarian or had gone iron-deficient by dabbling in it at one point in their life. It all started to make a bit more sense to me after I dined at Cafe Santropol. I will never forget their decadent and thick homemade rye bread and their triple-decker sandwiches with layers of nut-and-seed filled cream cheeses. Exotic fruits decorated the plates, and there was always more than I could eat. I tried a few things, but my favourite was the tuna, tomato and cream cheese sandwich. The combo was mouth-watering, and for years afterwards I'd try to recreate it at home. On every trip back to Montreal I've stopped in here to introduce their culinary creations to a friend and get another taste. They have a gorgeous, lush patio out back, fenced in and private. The dimly-lit restaurant is an old house where you can sip fruit teas for hours and study or laze away a summer afternoon."}
{"text":"Santropol's best sandwich pays homage to a classic 70s slapstick feature. I recommend ordering that sandwich with ham. I'm also a huge fan of their americanos, amazing.  Once I was there working late with a friend and I didn't want more caffeine so I ordered a hot chocolate. I was quite surprised when it arrived with a tall mountain of whipped cream perched atop. We all got a good laugh, and I joked about feeling like a little kid.  The decor and ambiance is fantastic too. Get a table outside in the garden if the weather is right."}
{"text":"Place unique, cuisine originale et surprenante, ambiance tranquille propice à d'agréables moments entre amis ou pour travailler seul...  Une terrasse à l'arrière toute décorée pour un dépaysement assez bien réussi, je vous avouerais!"}
{"text":"Starting with the food - the sandwiches were really good.  I had the Killer Tomato with added Chicken Salad - solid.  The salads were large and colorful.  The house bread was light and tasty. Costs were reasonable.  I have no complaints about the the actual menu, however the place drops several stars in my book because of poor service - which was somewhere between apathetic and F* You.  The waiter for example, brought 4 forks with our meal (4 people, makes sense right?), but only 2 napkins.  Attempts to flag him down for more napkins resulted in us being visibly ignored.  We ended up getting our own napkins from the inside kitchen.  He never made another appearance at our table after that.  We had to ask how we pay, which I guess we were supposed to infer that we were table #45 to tell the cashier up front.  4 stars for food 1 star for service 2.5 total"}
{"text":"Conseillé par le guide du routard, et après avoir lu les bons avis Yelp, je me suis dit qu'avant d'aller admirer la vue sur Montréal du Mont Royal, j'allais venir manger un ptit bout au café Santropol.  J'ai donc choisi de prendre une formule moitié de sandwich/soupe, et wahouuu, heureusement que je n'ai pris qu'une moitié ! le sandwich était ENORME, mais vraiment, je me suis même demandé comment j'allais manger ça, mais finalement, je ne me suis pas trop mal débrouillée ( ;) ), et la soupe de pois était vraiment bonne. Tout comme le sandwich d'ailleurs. Le tout était accompagné d'une petite salade.  Bref, j'ai donc apprécié ma pause déj \"Healthy\" dans cet endroit cosy, avec de nombreux bouquins tout autour de moi, et il parait qu'il y a une terrasse extérieur, mais vu le froid... je suis pas allée voir ça :)  Bon rapport qualité/prix, 12$ avec le tips, j'ai pas trouvé ça excessif.  Peut-être qu'un service un peu plus souriant rajouterais une étoile ;)  En tout cas, je recommande vraiment pour un lunch!"}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance. inside is funky old pressed tin ceilings & architectural salvage abounds...I want my house to look like this.  The garden terrace in the back is so beautiful & relaxing when the weather permits. It can be a busy place though...one of those restaurants where you kind of have to stay conscious of how long you've been waiting for your order in case the staff needs a 'nudge'...Best to be zen, but aware nonetheless. Funny that most of my favourite restaurants seem to be like this. I think a bit of polite nudging is worth it, considering the quality of what finally arrives. Don't arrive there starving & agitated, you will just ruin the place for yourself...and that would be a shame. It's the kind of place you bring a new love interest to, that way you are completely absorbed in the conversation and staring into each other's eyes, and touching each other's hands...you are eventually awakened by the arrival of plates overflowing with beautiful, healthy, delicious food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Santropol is a perfect I've-got-an-afternoon-off-and-want-to-read-my-book-over-a-coffee spot. The servers can be a bit...relaxed...but the food is top-notch, homemade, and delicious.  Sadly, the Killer Tomato sandwich, highlight of my first visit, is no longer possible for me...dairy intolerance be damned. But there are some dairy-free options; I can recommend the chicken salad. Or just get a cup of soup and enjoy it with piles of fresh, thickly-cut Santropol bread.  The coffee is fairly traded and organic, also locally roasted and fresh. Soy milk is available for their espresso drinks and chai tea. (Yay!)  As others have mentioned, the garden in back is delightful. The front porch is also a fun spot, especially if you have forgotten to bring your own book or just like the forbidden thrill of eating lunch in a library."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with their sandwiches that are very expensive . You have to put 10$ minimum to get a sandwich. They put a lot of sauce and no filling . They have big loaves of bread so expect to eat a lot of bread and nothing inside.   The only positive point is that their coffee is strong enough to keep going for the day."}
{"text":"Beautiful terrace and my Montreal friends have told me the restaurant provides community benefits, but an absolutely atrocious staff:  Waitress 1 served me a coffee and never returned. Waitress 2 came by 30 mins after I sat down to ask if I wanted to eat. Waitress 3 told me that breakfast was no longer served even though I sat down during breakfast hours. Waiter brought me check."}
{"text":"Possibly the most pretentious café in Montreal. The place generally looks nice and cosy but seriously, the food is horrible. I ordered a vegan sandwich which was basically apple and carrot grated over two pieces of brown bread. They gave me a side of salad which was basically grass. No dressing or even olive oil. They sat me outside near some water area which was breeding mosquitoes. There's so much mosquito in their garden, I don't know how they got approved for hygiene. It's really unhealthy and unadvisable to sit your customer next to a mosquito breeding ground. The service is also not that great, they make you wait really long time for something as simple as filter coffee. The place isn't clean either. There were stains in my napkin  and the cutleries needed to be wiped. Additionally , they are using   \"vegan mayonnaise\" to sell air because I ordered a sandwich with vegan mayo and it was so dry that even California looks flooded in front of it. The menu says the place has a historic significance in Montreal and I am all up for that but they should really put an effort to serving customers. I really don't know why this restaurant still runs because honestly they're  exploiting their customers in the name of preserving a neighbourhood building. This is peak Montreal white hipster vibe. They would buy anything that appears down trodden but in truth, is really expensive for its value."}
{"text":"i love sandwiches, and since i don't eat meat, a place that specializes in veggie sandwiches should presumably be a good fit.   i ordered the tomato sandwich which had an extremely appetizing description, boasting about sun-dried tomatoes and some other fixings. i was absolutely, devastating unimpressed with the result. the bread was thick, and although the inside was quite soft and squishy, the outside was hard to chew. and because of it's massive proportions, it sorta towered over the meager components- literally 4 small slices of tomato, one leaf of lettuce, and cream cheese (with tiny chunks of sundried tomato hidden within) sparsely covering the middle of the sandwich. majority of the experience consisted of me chewing dry bread. seriously.   maybe i'm spoiled because my wife makes such amazing veggie sandwiches, but this is actually the worst restaurant experience i've had in as long as i can remember. i can think of 2000 better places i would have liked to spend my $9. and that's just off the top of my head.  high reputation DOES NOT EQUAL good food."}
{"text":"Santropol = sandwiches. Loads of the sandwiches have cream cheese which I normally don't like but somehow the sandwiches are still delicious. I highly recommend the Killer Tomato. I've been meaning to try the carrot cake -- I've spied huge portions of cake topped with ice cream and fresh fruit on other people's plates. A bit pricey but the sandwiches are huge."}
{"text":"great and original ambiance with decent soups and good coffee. Although the chai tea lattes are not drinkable and the sandwiches are only good if you like cream cheese."}
{"text":"The most colorful, enormous, and cutely creative sandwiches. Pleasant outdoor patio in the rear garden. Quirky design, friendly staff, good side dishes. Close to the park if you opt to take your huge sandwich onto the grass. My absolute favorite: the No. 13 on the monster, three-story sandwich list, with hearty slices of bananas, slabs of cream cheese, drizzled honey, and blackcurrant jam."}
{"text":"Very nice little vegetarian, healthy, sandwich place. I got a mango chutney one with chicken salad (sorry i want my meat). It was very fresh and refreshing from all those heavy restaurants. It was a bit expensive in my opinion. My mom raved about this place for so long. The sandwiches are huge! None of us finished them. They were all very good. Too much cream cheese though. I wouldnt mind going back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 10 years and this is a great sandwich place in Montreal and has been consistently so for as long as I've been coming here.   For years I stuck with just getting the Killer Tomato sandwich  (cream cheese and sun-dried tomatoes) but have ventured over to the Northern Lights (cream cheese, olives, and roasted pecans) and the Pepper Island (pesto, cream cheese, and jalapeno jelly) in more recent years.  All are delicious but keep in mind you have to be a fan of cream cheese to fully appreciate their greatness (some friends have complained that there is too much for their liking). They also have great milkshakes and coffee.     Great place to hang out on the patio in the summer or warm up in the winter. Very casual for doing work or just reading a book."}
{"text":"It's one of the situations where you walk by and something just pulls you in. This place had an awesome garden which was really appealing but we just had a good feeling about the food. What surprised me was how big the portions were. I had a tuna salad sandwich with cream cheese (amazing cream cheese that is!), It was huge but really delicious. I though the gazpacho was alright but it was just too much to finish it all. And I had a cafe latte after I saw her making them and they looked so appealing - worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere and service. Had the Sweet Roots sandwich and an iced coffee. Highly recommend this to anyone who likes real, natural foods"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Santropol.  This morning some friends from out of town were looking for a sweet place for breakfast, and we finally decided to come here. I've only ever been to Santropol in the past for lunch (killer tomato sandwich, for the win!), so this was a new experience for me as well. Despite being very popular and highly recommended, it is still home to many locals and hasn't lost its special, unique touch. Great service too, our waiter was so nice and helpful.  Being a beautiful, sunny day, we made sure to sit in the lovely garden, amongst the flowers and the cute, little pond. We ordered the Montréalaise and Florentine, both of which were delicious. The bagels tasted fresh and were toasted to perfection, the eggs were cooked nicely, and it didn't feel very heavy. We had an iced coffee to balance out the 25 degree summer sun, while still getting a good pick-me-up made by some great, fair trade, and local coffee.   This place is simply magical."}
{"text":"J'étais allée dans ce café dans les années 80. J'y suis retournée hier et c'était comme dans mon souvenir. La terrasse est magnifique! Il faisait froid (25 septembre) et on nous offrait des couvertures pour pouvoir manger dehors!  Les sandwiches sont énormes et excellents, le café au lait magique. Le service est un peu lent et semble erratique. C'est aussi un peu cher pour luncher. (Une quarantaine de dollars pour 2). Mais ça vaut le détour."}
{"text":"Food at santropol taste really good and the price is very reasonable; however, the portions are way too big.  It is impossible to have a three course meal.  Sandwiches are heavenly, but the salad that comes with the sandwiches don't need to be there.  It just looks like a bunch of vegetables plopped on the plate with a very acidic dressing on the side.  So in my opinion, they should get rid of the salad, reduce the portions and charge the same price.   Great food overall."}
{"text":"Love this place! Stumbled a pontoon this while on vacation in montreal. So cute! And the food was great as well! Love the patio garden all set up for dining! What a beautiful delicious place!"}
{"text":"Charming restaurant at the foot of the Mont-Royal; definitely go on their terrace. Their terrace has a big tree in the middle and its vegetation and hippie ambiance will give you that zen feeling you are looking for! Also, there's quite a bit of shade (probably created by that big tree) so it's always nice on a sunny day. We went there as a group of 5 and easily found a table. We got their sandwiches and they were huge! Same applies if you get their milkshakes (just saying!). I tried the carrot and tofu sandwiches, and definitely preferred the tofu one. The only thing we found was that it missed some sauce and that it tasted dry. I heard from friends that they loved their coffee (I'm not a big coffee drinker but wanted to put it here in case you were wondering). I'd definitely return to try more plates."}
{"text":"hearty and hefty clever sandwiches that won't let you go hungry and with a mindful mission? i appreciate santropol and its vegetarian option soups and sandwiches, not to mention the wi-fi i parttake when i am eating said eatables. the interior lends itself to a modern, cozy and easy space that is just right for studying, reading, or soaking up some quiet. next time, some garden seating will be a priority. i appreciate the food and serving sizes but would like some more attention from the staff. next tie i visit, santropol will likely be on my list again however, i do see a shortage of pocs (people of color), but perhaps that is just montreal's hip artistic  scene in general. [an obvious 3.5 stars]"}
{"text":"Not the best place to go if you're allergic to dairy.  Basically all the sandwiches have cream cheese as a main ingredient. I ordered the veggie pate sandwich with tomatoes and had a cup of gazpacho with it. The gazpacho was huge and pretty good, but the sandwich was not very tasty. I found that there was too much bread, and the veggie pate didn't have the best flavour. I didn't finish it, despite being really hungry when I arrived. Also, the bread was dry and not toasted.  The Hubster had a chicken salad sandwich, which he said was pretty underwhelming. He was pretty put off by the fact that they don't serve alcohol.  Aside from that, they have a gorgeous back patio and good service."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great service. What more can one ask for?  Spacious place, with a nice patio in the back.   Menu is in French, and English. All the staff seem to speak both languages as well.   Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Arrived about 12 noon and it was nearly empty. We waited to be seated and was ignored by several staff. We waited 10 mins and then left. I used to love this place when I lived in Montreal but today's experience was terrible."}
{"text":"Santropol would be a lot better if they get rid of the little troll that works there, she has the biggest attitude! felt sorry for the people she was helping slams down the menus on the table and food on 2 multiple groups that we're being seated and gave a couple attitude because she thought they just came in and sat down, when they have been on the waiting list and we're seated by the nice guy taking names for the wait list. I would describe her but I think if you were there you would know whom I speak of.  If you are the manager or the owner of this place, she seems like the smallest one there out of the girls that work there, she is terrible not nice at all. Everyone one else seemed really nice.  Other than that this place is a good spot, but my experience was completely ruined by her."}
{"text":"If you want sandwiches and soup, the ingredients are extremely fresh, the portions are huge, and the prices are reasonable.  3 things you don't find together very often.  We sat on the outdoor patio because the weather was excellent.  I started with the spicy carrot-apple puree soup... something I was unsure about at first but it sounded better than the vegetable soup.  It turned out to be delicious.  I followed this up with the \"Pepper Island\" sandwich, with pesto cream cheese, chicken salad, and chopped peppers (a replacement for the missing jalapeno jelly).  Trust me when I say that mere mortals do not need a full sandwich portion if you get soup.  A half portion should be plenty, and you will not hate yourself afterwards.  Wash it all down with one of their special soda floats.  I went with the maple-spice soda float.  I felt like I was drinking soda water that had been hypersaturated with maple sugar infused sugar and topped with a scoop of ice cream.  It was amazing.  -1 star for generally slow, inattentive service.  Perfect if you want to laze about and study textbooks (which many were doing) but if you actually have a timetable it's kind of annoying.  The food is amazing here, so just come mentally prepared."}
{"text":"Certainly local and personal but not necessarily memorable. I believe too much enthusiasm stems from how cute and unique Santropol is. Certainly looks good from every perspective and offers the luxury of outdoor and covered lunch but the food offer is not that great.  Surely the sandwiches sound appealing with their fruity ingredients but make sure you understand that you will have jelly and not actual fruits. Hence my disappointment: the taste wasn't bad but I felt that the sandwiches were way too sweet. More, although the cream cheese is pretty good, the load is way to heavy and does not combine that well with the jelly. Don't get me wrong: it wasn't bad tasting but I felt that the food would gain in interest by balancing the cream cheese and the jelly more accurately. Furthermore, drinks are okay but still way to heavy and the service was pretty long despite a relatively calm afternoon.  Very Montreal, although not at its best."}
{"text":"Famous for their beautiful outdoor terrace, social conscience (Santropol Roulant is a meals-on-wheels charity) and their blend of coffees (the original Montréalaise is by far the best of the batch and the only one I'd buy), Santropol has been a Plateau institution for three decades. It's a great place to hang out and they have lots of healthy vegetarian options.  Unfortunately, much as I try, I just don't like their specialty sandwiches which make up the cornerstone of their menu; they come on a thick, heavy brown bread that I don't care for and the majority are lacquered with an unpalatable heap of cream cheese. Oh well, I'll still go from time to time."}
{"text":"Great place for sandwiches, soups, and coffee. The garden is the best in the area. a real treat. They do have several veggie options. It's relatively quite, so having a conversation is easy.  Good place to sit and work, or hang out with a couple of friends. I don't remember large tables for big groups though. Decently priced. Quite unorthodox, but chill and fun."}
{"text":"chair was a little rocky. the sandwich was prodigious in size, truly colossal. i also felt like a rabbit while eating their salad, which had sprouts in it, very leporine indeed, mm, yes.   decor: tremendous smell: exhilarating service: buttery smooth, silky, even  complaint: your coffee somehow made me more tired, and for that, i must eradicate a star, for such behaviour is simply unforgivable"}
{"text":"Great social mission.  Okay-ish food.  Decent location.  Untrained service."}
{"text":"Sometimes I feel craving for a Santropol milkshake. They are good. Not over-the-top crazy-amazing, but taste 'real.' Hard to explain unless you drink one.  They are known for their sandwiches. They are pretty good, but have tons of cream cheese in them.  You can get food to go as well."}
{"text":"Just love this place - 4th here - and always try the same thing as i can't just pass up the opportunity to have a Killer Tomato Chicken Salad sandwich!  Oh and the soup, rich and tasty.  The bread is so fresh.  I know I am all over the place on this review , just like that sandwich was all over my face and hands - so big ;). Always friendly service in a nice environment- a great escape from my downtown high rise office!"}
{"text":"Oh gawwwwwwd. I ADORE this place. Obviously, the summer is the best time to stop by, because hello - terrace. But the last time I ate here was in February, for a birthday lunch. The indoor seating was comfy and cozy and the service was fantastic. Seriously. When I mentioned it was my birthday, the entire staff started looking around for candles to put in some cake. Very sweet.  Okay, the actual food. Their bread is the bread they serve in heaven. I'm convinced. Love love love all the interesting choices of sandwich. Most of which involve some kind of crazy spread that is packed with deliciousness. And lots of veggies. There are a few things you can order with meat, but this place is predominately for the tofu crowd. If you are not part of that crowd, don't worry, you will be at Santropol.  There will tend to be a line out the door in nice weather. Just know that. And know that it's worth the wait.  Oh and order the carrot cake. Just do it."}
{"text":"Roomier than it looks from the outside. Super casual soup and sandwich type restaurant. I can see why students love it...I would eat here all the time if I lived close by. I had the Duluth Sandwich with caramelized onions, pears, Old Cheddar, arugula & mayo. My husband had the Smoked Ham sandwich. Great vegetarian, vegan and non-vegetarian options. Sandwiches are big enough to share and are served with a great little side salad. Price is reasonable.  I liked this place so much I came back for an early lunch two days later and tried the CBLT sandwich with coconut bacon-tasty & crispy and also had the Santropol Chai."}
{"text":"Unique. Beautiful terrasse. Great vegetarian chili. Lots of nice hot sauces. Tapacio was great with the chili. Can be crowded. Don't go if you're in a rush. Great reputation for coffee, but didn't try any."}
{"text":"You know how you sometimes re-visit places you used to go to, years earlier, and you find that they've changed - and not for the better? Well, on a recent trip to Montreal with my two kids, I decided to take them to all my old haunts. I was saddened to see that so many were either gone or just....sad and run down. So I was THRILLED to return to San Tropol to discover it was just the same, wonderful, eclectic place as it was back in my McGill days (1980-1983)!!!! The whole restaurant was the same, the set-up was the same, and the fabulous food was the same!  We sat outside in the lovely courtyard terrasse, and it was as pretty as always - perhaps prettier, even, with a cobalt blue fence with happy yellow details, a small central garden with small statues, and strung lights from the trees. Intimate and pretty. The restaurant interior is as warm as it was 30 years ago, with various sections and two central washrooms (the latter are small, unisex, and be forewarned: the door on one washroom never closes or locks. Yikes). Embossed metaled coffered tiles line the ceiling and walls, with large, opened garage door \"windows\" and overhead fans in the summertime, creating a breezy space.   The menu is still great, with humongous cream cheese-based sandwiches made from fresh bread. I was saddened to see that my \"Sisters of Jeanne Mance\" sandwich was no longer offered (it was my old standby), but thankfully they still had the \"Northern Lights\" (with olives. A family favorite!), and they had some new offerings which were delicious: the \"No. 6.5\" with bananas and black currents and honey was amazingly delicious! And my youngest kid had the \"Mango Madness\" which she loved (she said it was a bit spicy, though - and very messy! But she ate the whole thing). The cauliflower and cheddar soup was a bit bitter, and my kids said it had a bit of an off aftertaste, but they doctored it up with a bit of sugar and then said it was great. The accompanying side salads were small but good, and the salad dressing was excellent.  For dessert we shared the carrot cake, and it was a moist as I remember. It could have used a bit more icing, but it was delicious. And the chai latte and the cafes au lait were wonderful, and presented beautifully in pretty glasses with fruit as garnishes. In fact, all the dishes were plated and presented beautifully, with lovely fruit garnishes.  Our server was nice, despite her manning many tables, we didn't have to wait long at all.   Parking on the street can be problematic, so I recommend going at off times.  This restaurant is truly a gem. I can't recommend it strongly enough."}
{"text":"Awesome place to come for lunch...great soup and sandwiches (very unique). Also, in the summer they have a nice big patio outside.  If you're into hot sauces, make sure you ask as they have about 10 different ones you can try!"}
{"text":"Another of my go-to places. Service can be annoyingly spotty at times, but when it's good, the place is worth it for the good stick- to -your ribs soups and monster-sized sandwiches. There is a soup/sandwich special before 4 PM and the cakes are the old fashioned home baked variety. One can relax, enjoy one's food and soak in the laid back, hippie atmosphere;no hurry or pressure to finish and leave. In summer IF one is lucky to get a spot on the outside terrace, one can enjoy one's meal al fresco."}
{"text":"Loved finding this place, and had the best Italian white bean soup with delicious bread on the patio. Perfect for a slow afternoon of reading. They also have kombucha on tap!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite sandwich spots!! The outdoor patio is perfect for the current weather!!!  This time we ordered the Roast Beef with Blue Cheese Sandwich and their signature Killer Tomato Sandwich.  The ingredients always taste fresh and servings are huge. Service is great."}
{"text":"I like this spot but the service was a bit curt.  I like the large bread sandwiches especially when walking on a cold day.  The sandwich soup special is a great deal for a filling meal.  Free wifi is easy with no password to deal with.  I'll definitely go back after a walk through Park Mont Royal"}
{"text":"I love places with a cute atmosphere and Santropol is definitely one of the cutest one I've seen so far. The whole interior emits a cosy vibe, with different \"rooms\", lots of arts, plants, pillows and low key lighting. This is the kind of place you want to bring a first date to. The patio in the back is one of my favourite places to hang out during summer, with the fairy lights and all the greens.   Their sandwiches, although relatively pricey, are the bomb. They are HUGE, very healthy (lots of vegetables) and served on pumpernickel bread (my favourite is the mango one). They also have alternating soups of the day and I've never gone wrong with one of their soups and if you love carrot cake, you must try theirs!  One of my favourite hangout spots in Montreal!"}
{"text":"All the good reviews take the words right out of my mouth! Officially my new favourite sandwich spot in Montreal. Also, the chili was AMAZING!! If it's a nice day when you go you HAVE to sit outside. The outside patio/garden has the nicest vibes and it's just a nice way to relax and enjoy the amazing food they have to offer."}
{"text":"The food is just fine, but it's the service and the phenomenal back patio that make this place shine!"}
{"text":"This place was so chaotic and is in need of more employees (preferably non hippies /hipsters) We waited in line for 15 for a table (plenty of empty ones just no one was around to seat us) Once we were seated we waited another 15 minutes before someone came over and the only reason they came over is because another customer acknowledged that we arrived before him and his family (Thank You Kind Sir ). They stop serving brunch at 11:30 so we needed up ordering sandwiches Tuna for me and Chicken Salad for KP. The portions are HUGE and the sandwich itself was ok. I was more a fan of the bread it was very good. I also tried a cassis soda which was try refreshing. Sandwiches are usually not my go to hangover food but it helped and this places was dangerously close to our apt. After tax and tip it came out to be about 13 each. We had to pay in the front and waited about 10 minutes to do that I wish you could deducted your time being wasted from the cost of your meal, I probably wouldn't rush back here but brunch gets stellar reviews and a friend of a friend swears by it every time he's in town so next time maybe ...."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Montreal. I remember discovering this place with its charming back patio green oasis in the heart of the Plateau almost twenty years ago, and have gone back every time I return to Montreal since. Anyone I've ever taken there for lunch is happy with their meal, which is pretty much a giant sandwich on fresh pumpernickel bread and either a soup or salad.   The sandwich options are pretty unique and it's hard to make a decision about which one would be the most interesting and delicious. I always opt for smoked salmon. I would recommend that if not ordering the smoked salmon, then get the chicken salad addition to the sandwich, otherwise you're looking at a lot of bread and cream cheese with other accent toppings, like nuts or spreads. The chicken salad is divine and they'll add it to any sandwich. The soups are ALWAYS good - typically a lentil-based option or a gazpacho.   Very hipster in feel, with a little bit of original legit artist/hippie vibe."}
{"text":"After delaying this visit for quite a while due to my initial thoughts of the place having a somewhat boring and basic concept (ie sandwiches, soups, and salads with the aesthetics as the main attraction), I decided to check it out for myself after having weird cravings for something healthy yet filling. So, what's my verdict on Café Santropol?  Well, I can definitely say that the place is basically how everyone else has described it - cute as a button. I took a seat on the outside patio close to the pond, and it, combined with the tree branches and fairy lights above me, made for a very cozy atmosphere. Based on the ambience alone, it would make for a perfect summer date to impress that special one in your life - it's that charming.  As for the food, however, I was slightly less impressed overall. I ordered the espresso milkshake and the Santropol sandwich with roast beef. The milkshake still had a decent espresso taste, but it was rather lukewarm and felt watered-down. The sandwich would have been perfect if they had used a better blue cheese-to-cream cheese ratio - the taste of the blue cheese was overpowering for my tastebuds. However, the rest of the sandwich's components tasted really good, and the pumpernickel bread in particular was super tasty. While I do agree with some of the reviews that they could use more filling (especially for the price), the quality of the bread alone is enough to excuse the fact, I guess.  Overall, come here if you love the idea of a cute and cozy date night (or \"me time\") with a perfect summer breeze to go along with it. While the food is a bit overpriced for what it's worth (and I would rather have awful ambience + amazing food than the opposite), I would, much to my chagrin, come back solely so I can experience those homey patio vibes once again."}
{"text":"My favourite café so far! The atmosphere is incredible because of the scenery... I was seated right next to the koi pond and had a beautiful view of the greenery. Ordered the killer tomato sandwich with chicken salad and it was so good that I finished the whole thing (slowly but surely) while catching up with a friend. Bread was soft, chicken was not dry, and sauce/mayo was refreshing. My friend ordered the kombucha but sadly it was just a RISE bottle (we had a good laugh about this because we both thought it would be an in-house creation). Paid about $15.50 with tax and tip for the sandwich which is decent for the large portion. Service was pretty good too! Overall great experience and I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"One of the most favorite places in Montreal. They are always popular but still cozy and peaceful especially their lovely garden. I come back here every one month to get great sandwiches for my day off:)"}
{"text":"C'est bon, healthy et sans chichi. Cest de la bouffe certes végétarienne mais réconforte, les sandwich sont d'ailleurs énormes. Le cadre est agréable et la terasse en ete l'est encore plus!"}
{"text":"Coup de cur !  Restaurant vraiment idéal pour un déjeuner lors d'une journée ensoleillée d'été : on peut y manger des sandwichs, bagels ou salades = frais et sain, et surtout profiter de leur terrasse, que dis-je JARDIN au fond du restaurant qui est PARFAIT ! Petit bassin avec des poissons, arbres pour l'ombre, petites guirlandes lumineuses, quelques tables style pique-nique avec des coussins... C'est un cadre juste idyllique !   L'assiette est au niveau : j'ai goûté une grande salade du jardin avec salade de pois chiches, servie dans un saladier, c'était exactement ce que je voulais : sans prétention, frais, goutu, complet tout en restant léger ; idéal après un rythme alimentaire un peu déséquilibré.  Les soupes sont généreusement servies avec leur pain signature, celui utilise dans les sandwichs, qui a l'air bien bon (et on dirait complet). (Sandwichs énormes au passage) La plupart des plats tournent autour de 10$ mais on peut être rassasié à partir de 7$ !  En plus, le café est servi avec quelques tranches de fruits : trop chou !   Bref, j'A-D-O-R-E !"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places of all time. I had heard great things about this cafe before venturing there myself but was a bit apprehensive because I had heard that a number of their sandwiches are stacked with cream cheese. I am not a cream cheese fan so that does limit the menu for me quite a bit - but their non cream cheese options are to die for.   The place is adorable. What a wonderful little hideaway in the the middle of Montreal. It's very quaint and has the most wonderful outdoor patio (unfortunately since it's Montreal it only gets utilized some of the year).   All of the ingredients are so amazingly fresh. The sandwiches are served on giant fresh pumpernickel bread. The fixings in the sandwiches are amazing. I used to be a hummus sandwich fan, there hummus is made onsite and is delicious, but then I got turned onto the Sweet Root sandwich. This sandwich is by far my favourite sandwich of all time. It's delicious and so unique. It probably the thing I miss most about living in Montreal and it's the one thing that I always make sure to get when I go back to Montreal to visit.   Also, you need to try the coffee. So delicious.   This place is a must in Montreal."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré l'ambiance! Le service est excellent et leurs sandwichs végétaliens aussi! Je recommande à 100%"}
{"text":"I wish I could transport this place to Chicago - if Cafe Santropol were in Chicago I'd be here constantly.  Though I'm sure the garden is better enjoyed in daytime, I wound up here on a warm lovely night and still enjoyed sitting outside (bonus: spot the cats!  Those with cat allergies and/or opposed to dining in restaurants with animals should choose another establishment).  I ordered the No. 13 (the menus are in French and English, yay!), which is a giant sandwich on brown bread with blackcurrant jam, bananas, honey and cream cheese...and, lettuce.  The lettuce was weird, though overall the sandwich was quite good.  Other reviewers are right, Cafe Santropol is seriously heavy on the cream cheese and it seems to be featured in almost every sandwich. I also ordered a chai soy latte, which was great.  You can tell they actually brew the tea rather than using the prepackaged stuff like most places do.  I lingered far after I was done eating, just enjoying the ambiance on the patio (and yes, fine, eavesdropping on my fellow diners).  I never felt rushed or as though the staff wanted me to leave.  Cafe Santropol would be great for lunch or dinner and would also be a fantastic place to waste a few hours with friends.  If only we had something like this at home..."}
{"text":"The tofu sandwich is OFF THE HOOK. When we went, we happened to sit in the garden out back, but it looks like a great place regardless of whether you want to have a coffee/lunch date with someone or do some studying alone. Latte was great, too--erved in a very swanky milkshake glass with a little melon garnish."}
{"text":"The drinks here have always been impeccable, but they really oversell the food. First of all, if you're interested in fiber, don't bother ordering a sandwich with \"brown bread.\" It's Wonderbread dough mixed with food dye. The menu offers light fair, but don't fear, carnivores, you can still get those ham chunks on top of your salad. I highly recommend anything with fresh coffee in it; Santropol is well-known for its high-quality, fair-trade and organic coffee production and distribution, and with the roasters located just a dozen blocks away, the cafe can't be lacking.   The service is casual and friendly, so don't expect anyone to break a sweat bringing you lunch. However they will go out of their way to make you feel like you're hanging out in your own backyard, and recommend anything on the menu. The main highlight of the cafe itself is the garden, complete with slate flagstone paths, bauble lights hanging from overhead foliage and a bubbling fountain. During the cold months it's nice to curl up with a cuppa at one of the tables near the kitchen and catch some of the banter floating between the waitstaff. I would recommend any afternoon in the summer or winter being taken in this cafe with a large drink and a good book."}
{"text":"Ten years later, this place totally doesn't disappoint. I initially came here when visiting friends who were going to McGill. I think I ate there every single day I was in Montreal during my previous visit (sadly, ten years ago, though I plan on rectifying that asap)   I like the homey vibe, the friendly servers and how they tolerated my franglais. I also like the somewhat creepy minarets. They added a touch of magic to my already awesome sandwich.  You know when the bread is fluffy between your fingers, and is slightly crusty on the outside, which gives a textural experience as well as a tasty experience? Welllll, the pumpernickel bread was THAT good. Awesome. I would like to try all of the sandwiches at some point, and would definitely recommend the smoked ham sandwich.  Also, I got an espresso that was poured over some vanilla ice cream. Heaven."}
{"text":"I still dream of their sandwiches and teas.  It's a cute, creative sandwich place with a hippie-ish feel located close to the plateau's shops and apartments."}
{"text":"One of the few places where you'll come out full, but not bloated and weighed down by lethargy. Prices are a little high, though it's still worth the trip.  I had a Killer Tomato. Their bread must be made of clouds and whole grain cocaine and used as a vessel for their creative fillings."}
{"text":"My friend at McGill took me here last year, so of course I had to come back on my next trip. The sandwiches here are amazing. The bread is soft and they give you generous slices; the sandwiches pretty much overflow. The waitress was very nice and brought us everything really quickly, and the vegetarian chili was really good. The food could be a bit cheaper, but you get really big helpings and the ingredients all seem incredibly fresh. Try the milkshakes. The outdoor patio is really nice (even when it was raining we were happy sitting under the awning), and the owner seems to have a white cat that walks around like it owns the place."}
{"text":"Here is what you should do: go to Santropol some early weekday afternoon in the summer. Sit in the garden, or in the sunroom in the back, somewhere warm, but shady, breezy, comfortable where you can smell the flowers and the trees and the coffee roasting and the bread baking. Order a killer tomato sandwich with hot peppers and an iced herbal tea. Take your time to look around, read a book off the shelves, ask about the history, get a bag local fair trade coffee on your way out. Wander up Duluth through the park toward the mountain. Take a nap on the grass. When you wake and wander your way home, make a pot of Santropol's delicious Montreal roast and give your yourself a small congrats back pat from me for a day well done."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sandwich places in Montreal. I hate going out for most sandwich places, I can make one at home.  However, the selection and flavors you can find here cannot be easily recreated at home. The decoration is eclectic with the collection of furniture, wall art and overall paint job looking like it was pulled together from the \"free\" bin by the master of home decor. I only visit during the summer evenings because their terrace in back is absolutely gorgeous on summer nights. The same eclectic decor, surrounded by greenery and lit by white Christmas lights throughout the trees."}
{"text":"The food is great and the outdoor patio in the back is amazing on summer nights"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Had the Duluth sandwich. Fresh pumpernickel bread, coconut bacon (extra), aged cheddar, pear slices, vegenaise... with vegetarian chili. All delicioso.. I also had a chai tea (I said iced but they mistook it for the hot tea). Wasn't fantastic but the serving was very generous. All in all would go again! Nice ambiance, friendly atmosphere and cool decor. Right location too!"}
{"text":"This cafe was on the corner with a small sign to the side of the restaurant. It was a little hard to find. It has this adorable hipster vibe and the place was very inviting. The staff were all friendly. I was greeted and sat pretty promptly. There is a garden outback that you can sit down and eat in but with the colder temps, they close it off. I ordered a tuna and Hungarian cheese sandwich (soo amazing) and it was huge! It came with a side salad (delicious and fresh greens). Typically, sandwiches come with a poor or mediocre quality salad but not this one! The bread on the sandwich was their signature I believe. Very tasty! The meal also came with a small soup of the day. I got the fish chowder. It was tasty but lacked fish....it was mostly potatoes and veggies. It did have a lot of flavor so I enjoyed it. The food came out sooner than expected and I never felt rushed. Will come here again next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE... Just that is an experience. Worst I've seen in North America. WOW. Don't know if there is an connection but most of the staff are French Europeans (i used to live in France)  Food is really really good but again you may want to try to order it the day before you plan to go or bring a snack to way for your order."}
{"text":"Santropol is definitely a deserved institution. Apparently, they started as an attempt to save the block from urban-renewal demolition. That puts this place in the hall of fame for this urban planner. They have the chillest atmosphere of near any place in Montreal - their insane backyard is sublime, and it's cozy on the inside as well. For a vegetarian, Santropol is one of the best bets you can make. The menu is almost completely devoted to the art of the sandwich. This is an understandable focus given the location in French North America - but I'm not a super fan of sandwiches. Despite this, they offer enough variety to keep me coming back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"We went during All-Nighter Festival (Nuit Blanche) this past weekend and made it to Santropol as one of our last stops.  Sadly, they only served hot chocolate, soups/chili, and cakes at that time, so we didn't get to try their renowned sandwiches.  We split a chocolate cheesecake.  That was pretty good and surprisingly light (almost like a mousse).  My friend had the hot chocolate, and they topped it with whipped cream and fruit (unusual).  She said that was great.  The place is definitely very cute.  A lot of figurines and interesting decorations all over the cafe.  I can see how the garden would be nice during warmer weather.  I'd definitely give this place another shot."}
{"text":"The last time I was here was when I was kid, and I only remember that I didnt like it that much, but I had no idea why. So I decided to give a try and went there with a couple of friends. I have no idea why I didnt like it before!  Its a great place to chill with friends or even study. Their sandwiches seem really basic, but once they bring it to you, its this big sandwiches, filled with whatever choice of food you want. The price is super good! You think that it wouldnt be enough, but I was super full after I had that for lunch!   I'd also suggest the Chocolate milkshake! Comes with ice-cream and great as a small desert. All my friends were so jealous of me cause I had that, so basically they ended up drinking my milkshake..."}
{"text":"On this relatively warm Monday for Canada but cold for a Californian date, the place was crowded but I was able to find a seat. Service was a tad bit slow, but I heard that in Montreal waitresses letting you be is a thing, perhaps that was it! All in all a cute cafe, kind people, and people read and study all day, or have long discussions about who knows what (because everything was in French!). My sun-dried tomato sandwich with roast beef was just what I needed."}
{"text":"TLDR: A pintrester's dream restaurant that serves simple but delicious food.  First, if you can you have to sit on their beautiful terrace. It is colourful, fresh and a laptop free zone. Enjoy the koi pond and the greenery as you eat light and refreshing food. The first time I ever went on a Saturday evening, we also enjoyed live music from a fun little indie group.  Their sandwiches are big, and they offer you the choice to substitute half your sandwich with a soup. I ordered the CBLT as I am a huge fan of coconut bacon, and substituted half my sandwich with a sweet potato and almond butter soup. The soup was velvety smooth and tasty. The sandwich came with a little bit of salad and was delightful. Cafe Santropol is definitely my top pick for when I'm craving a sandwich.  Definitely, a restaurant you should visit in the summer and a great place for food date."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for ages, finally dropped in in the later afternoon after a long walk through the mountain.  Very cute little venue, with lovely comfortable but arty type seating in a semi outdoor garden area. Very relaxed. The service was a bit miss at first, with a long wait until we could get some attention, but eventually all good.  We tried a variety of soups, salads and sandwiches, and everything was just really tasty and fresh. Nothing super special here, but nice vibes, and very very fresh tasting food. And a lovely hangout spot too that's located in a cool part of town. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Such a cool place, very welcoming decor, plants, wood, brick. The outdoor terrasse looks beautiful. I had a soy latté and the No. 6.5 sandwich (banana, creme cheese and homemade jelly) wow!! What an awesome combo! Very very filling sandwiches! Lovely place!"}
{"text":"It's wonderful to find a restaurant with a large selection of vegetarian sandwiches, fresh soup, beautiful salads and house-made tea. It;s even more wonderful when the building has antique pressed tin tiles on the walls and ceiling, the original old wood bar, a sunny back room, and grows their own gigantic sprouts. The vegetables are colorfully selected, crisp and orginally spiral cut.  BUT, a few things to keep in mind. The service is close to abysmal. The boyfriend and I waited a half an hour after we ordered to receive our water and coffee (well, only his coffee arrived), and we would have walked out, except that our food came at exactly the same time. The food itself is tasty but certainly not gourmet - more like your creative college roommate who just discovered that you came put a giant amount of cream cheese on just about everything.  Know that you're going in for a nice sandwich and hopefully a nice seat by a window, nudge the staff (if you can find them) and don't even think about it if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with all the vegetarian and vegan options here!  The sandwiches are quite large, as are the large salads.  It did take quite awhile for our food to come out, but I realized that there is just one person making all the food for the whole restaurant (sometimes two).  So just plan on waiting awhile after your order, and know that when it comes it will be very large, very filling and very fulfilling.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the place is really special and price are good but the staff!!! OMG, I've rarely seen poor service like that in North America. I mean WOW... they are completely disorganized. You speak to 3 waitresses that don't speak to each other and it is terribly long to get your order. Food worth the wait but don't go there if you are not free for 3 hours."}
{"text":"What I really like about Cafe Santropol is that they leave you alone to work, they play great music and their coffee is always dependably good.  The waiters I've had here have always been really friendly and not demanding... totally cool with you just ordering a coffee and take your sweet ass time.  The last time I was there the waiter asked me if I needed a piece of paper to draw on when he saw me, pen in hand, furiously marking up an article.  ...That's pretty good service, no?  It doesn't hurt that it's a great location either."}
{"text":"Petit café avec une super ambiance. Deco vintage pleine de couleurs, on s'y sent bien! La terrasse est magnifique, style tropical, avec des loupiotes etc.  Le café propose des sandwichs végétariens notamment, qui sont absolument incroyables. La formule spéciale permet de prendre la moitié du sandwich et une soupe (choix entre deux gouts du jours). Excellente formule car un demi sandwich est déjà largement suffisant !  J'ai pris le sandwich - en fait composé de deux grosses tranches de pain brun moelleux - au cream cheese, chutney de mangues et un peu de salade.  Une salade accompagne également le sandwich. La soupe au curry, lait de coco, lentilles était vraiment délicieuse et bien consistante.  Seul hic, la serveuse. L'un de nous n'a reçu sa soupe que bien après les autres (elle semblait avoir oublié, nous avons du le lui rappeler). Ensuite c'est un des sandwichs qui n'arrivait pas, qu'on a du également re-demander et qui d'ailleurs manquait d'un ingrédient extra demandé.   Sinon les prix sont corrects et les boissons sont saines et bonnes également. Ils proposent des diabolos avec un grand choix de saveurs (vanille, sirop d'érable, amande, citron, etc.). Un peu fort sucré mais j'adore ca !"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite joint nationwide!  I no longer live in Mtl, but anytime I'm in town this place is a must hit 3-4x per week/visit (and given 514's food culture, that's serious business). Fantastic service, amazing atmosphere and best of all, outstanding food.   Service: staff and menus are bilingual. Service is prompt, courteous, efficient and accomodating.   Atmosphere: cozy eclectic bohemian, but not stuffy or run down. Great location. The only thing I'd suggest is something to make the wait more pleasant on the nights they get slammed with a line of people that goes all the way out the door - totally worth the wait though!  Food: Huge, satisfying portions, amazing and creative flavour combinations, fresh ingredients, including epically fabulous thickly sliced bread... all at a good value.  I'm honestly fanatical about this place, it's always treated me so well, and I'm sorely missing it right now."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me as having the best sandwiches in Montreal (sorry, that's Olive & Gourmando) so I was excited to go, especially because I'm vegetarian and it looked like they had a great veggie selection.   I was really disappointed. The service is really not good - I spent about 15 minutes standing next to the \"LET US SEAT YOU\" sign and the wait staff kept ignoring me, which was weird.   Then I had the Sweet Roots sandwich which just tasted very earthy (sure, it's root veg) but the bread was earthy too... I don't know, for the price I expected big flavour.   I probably won't come here again :("}
{"text":"Go to the very back of the restaurant and have your meal in their garden. It's beautiful and peaceful. You forget you are in the city!  I order the St. Urbain sandwich with chicken salad (they were all out of the Killer Tomato which is what I really had my eye on). The sandwich was tasty, and the bread and salad fresh. I only ate half of the sandwich and my salad so the portions are quite big.   No decaf coffee or espresso was a bummer.   Worth the visit if you are in the area and looking for a fresh meal."}
{"text":"Many people passing by the Duluth side of the cafe will surely recognize the colourful terrace at the back of Cafe Santropol. This spot literally has EVERYTHING you could ever want from a Cafe -- Fantastic coffee and drinks, homemade soups and chilis, delicious sandwiches (on thick bread with custom cream cheeses), loaded salads and delectable cakes.   In the past, I've tried and loved:  1. Tuna salad - Ask for extra dressing on their salads. I always feel like there isn't enough.   2. Killer tomato sandwich - Sundried tomatoes, basil and tomato. I added roast beef  3. Carrot cake - Most likely the best carrot cake I've had in my life. Unbelievably moist... I think there may be pineapple chunks or something in the batter. The slice is massive so you could easily share with someone and both be satisfied. There is juuuust enough cream cheese icing so it's not heavy but you get some with every bite.   4. Soups - I hesitate to name specific ones because they change them daily. Between the vegetable soup, Thai curry chicken and chili, I've loved them all so I would recommend whatever their daily special is!   5. Drinks - I love their Americanos, chai lattes and the Santropol herbal iced tea (pomegranate juice with hibiscus tea)   In the summertime, they have ample seating between the indoors and outdoors. There are plenty of plugs along the wall if you want to do work on your computer. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A unique cafe in the plateau Montreal. Its ambience is very Montrealish: old, casual, beautiful, wooden squeaky floors, bright lights and hustle of the people chatting. They offer a great selection of coffee, tea and sandwiches. I have heard that they have one of the best terraces in Montreal... but for that I have to revisit them in summers. I would totally recommend this place if you are looking for affordable breakfast or brunch in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"stopped in here without reading any reviews because we were in the area and it had nice outdoor seating.   okay so first off the service was kinda bad. we waited for a while for someone to come over and greet us, and even longer for him to come back and take our orders. apparently they all split tips and worked together, so you can ask anyone to help you. but the food was a huge disappointment. I got a soup and half sandwich and the soup was amazing. the sandwich... okay. first they told me I had to get it with cream cheese, and if I didn't all the other toppings would just fall out. so fine, cream cheese. I ordered it with chicken, which i thought meant chicken deli meat. wrong, chicken means CHICKEN SALAD, which I don't eat. I told this to another server (because my waiter never came over to check on us) and she just brought me another plate to take the chicken salad off the sandwich. but it was covered in mayo (which is the reason I don't eat chicken salad) so it was kinda pointless, plus I wanted a real sandwich not a veggie one. so I just didn't eat my sandwich at all. we waited forever for our check, but finally we stopped someone and they then explained they all work together and we pay at the register.   overall, it was horrible service, and a  horrible sandwich (my boyfriends, which he did eat, he was unhappy with as well). maybe it would be better if the menu was clearer and they were up front about how they served, but I'd still think they should have checked on us or at least offered another sandwich or something, rather than a plate to take the chicken salad that I didn't know would be there based on the \"add chicken\" option on the menu. I would NEVER go back, and hopefully if you do go this all was sufficient warning :)"}
{"text":"We went here with Quebecois friends who recommended it.  A very nice local spot, the patio is a lovely place to sit on a summer day and the prices are right.  The sandwiches come on the thickest, but also softest, bread you've ever seen.  The 1/2 sandwich-1/2 soup special is definitely worth it; our soup du jour was a nice borscht.  I had the vegan sweet root, although looking back it was a bit too light.  Would be nice if they had more options that didn't use cream cheese to create taste.  Santropol loses a start for the slow service, which may have been due to our particular waiter, but still....the bill took forever to come, the waiter said there was no way to coordinate soups arriving with sandwiches (suggested instead that soups may just as well arrive before or after the sandwiches as the kitchen pleased).  It was a busy day to be sure, but more attention would have been nice."}
{"text":"Amazing spot. Sit in the terrace if possible - absolutely perfect view of Mont Royal in the garden, which contains a small yard, a pond, and a handful of tables nestled together among plants.   The drinks are delicious, food is excellent and everything is very fresh. Espresso and tea drinks are served with slices of fresh fruit such as pineapple or orange on the rim of the glass or mug.   While the menu is somewhat limited, it's worth a visit for the atmosphere alone. Wifi is free, though this probably isn't the kind of spot you can set up shop in for hours.  A diverse crowd was eating here from groups of adults, to families with young children, who enjoyed running around the tables and playing in the pond. Très pittoresque!  I'm not sure I'd make a special trip to this place during months when the terrace is closed, because the food was great but not out of this world. When the weather is nice, it is worth visiting for the atmosphere alone."}
{"text":"Cute resto! There's a little pond in the back wit lights on the trees. It's very romantic except that at night the mosquitoes come out n we had to leave after awhile coz it was unbearable. The food however was delicious!  I had the roast beef sandwich with a salad. The bread was nice and fluffy. I took a bite of my friend's killer tomato sandwich and it was tasty. There was a lot of cream cheese but it was very good."}
{"text":"Café végétarien/hippie/bohème ! Bon café + leur salade du jardin au thon est délicieuse ! J'y retournerais pour essayer leurs sandwichs, c'est sûr ! Wifi gratuit gracieuseté d'île Sans Fil."}
{"text":"In the back of the house/cafe is a lovely garden space, which is the perfect place to sit on a summers day. Unfortunately, the food is poorly executed. Between our two sandwiches, there was easily over 1 lb. of cream cheese. Too much cream cheese on thick bread makes for a practically uneatable sandwich. The flavors are delicious, but there was too much cream cheese and bread to really taste anything else. It's too bad that the food didn't match the lovely setting."}
{"text":"Santropol! How many first dates, friendly lunches, long university reading sessions, hungover solitary coffee ravishings?   Whither flow the sandwiches of time?   I am a big fan of their carroty-raisiny veggie pate and their simple salads. All of their sandwiches are huge - the tuna will feed you for 2 days (if you are 5\"2'), but Santropol is really about being the meat between the slices of LIFE that is its atmosphere.   The stamped tin ceiling, murals, old books and wooden everything along with the beauuutiful leafy backyard make this the kind of place every Montrealer is happy to visit over and over.  I recommend asking 'light on the cream cheese' if you don't like it to be more than 2 centimeters thick.  Service wise, it varies. The place is bigger than it looks so the wait is usually justified. Take it in stride and enjoy their secondary function as highly mobile lusting targets."}
{"text":"I've been here countless times already and every time is something new! Great ambiance in the front for studying, great ambiance in the rest of the cafe for chatting and hanging out. The decorations are eclectic and vary per part of the cafe, definitely gives reason to come here often! I especially love their chai tea latte and their pepper island sandwich (seriously amazing). Will be coming back again and again to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"After a hearty hike through Mont Royal (narrowly escaping the tam-tam drummers) we took refuge on the terrace at Santropol. An urban oasis of coffee and tea, a hideaway with delicious treats. I'm talking sandwiches the size of your head.   I highly recommend dropping in for a quick caffeine jolt or a leisurely stint in the afternoon. It doesn't hurt that the owner Garth is one of the most gracious hosts you'll ever meet."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 24 years now which should tell you right away of how great the sandwiches, soups, milkshakes and salads are.  More than once I've brought out of town guests here and they always, without fail, are impressed with the food, the presentation and the atmosphere. The garden in the back is by far the best place to sit during the hot summer months but the seats inside are just as cozy in the winter time.   Prices have been steadily going up over the years but the place still somehow manages to rely that hippy-Boho vibe it's always had.  I'm not going to tell you which sandwich to get, my favorite changes constantly over time but you can't go wrong with the traditional flavors. Their originals have some unusual combinations here but they are always quite tasty like the Killer Tomato, Sweet Root and Pepper Island. I know I'm weird in saying this but sometimes it's the basic ingredients in the construction of any one dish is what either makes it or breaks it and in this case , it's the bread. No joke.  Once you start coming here, make a mental note of this place. You'l be coming back all the time."}
{"text":"Probably my best restaurant in town. I love their fresh foods and the whole place. There's a spot in the front with big windows and books, and in the back when it's warm enough, you get the lovely terrasse. Inside, it can get a bit noisy, but the decor is wonderful. Kind of fairy-like.  They also don't mind at all when you sit for hours staring at your laptop or have a good book.  Great prices, great food, very nice staff, wi-fi, lots of plants."}
{"text":"The service wasn't stellar but the decor makes up for it. There is adorable little secret garden seating in the back where you can watch birds and squirrels play while you eat. The menu is rather expansive and the portions are large but as others have mentioned many of the choices are cream cheese based. Definitely a unique restaurant and worth a try once, at least."}
{"text":"Une de mes terrasses préférées à Montréal. Un petit coin de paradis! Les sandwichs sont très bons. Le gâteau aux carottes une merveille. J'y retournerai ! (Note: Ne servent pas d'alcool)"}
{"text":"This place needs to be closed down! Why all the hype? Mostly because it 'looks and feels' \"trendy\". At best, it's mold ridden, and a good excuse not to clean the place, and then you add to this the fact that it is dusty. All this aside, the staff is either completely rude, or simply cannot be bothered. After arriving, it took 20 minutes to notice me, even though I was standing at the counter. Their online menu is NOT updated, so when I asked for a smoked salmon sandwich, the response (no joke) was, \"we don't carry salmon and fish items, because of the nuclear disaster meltdown in Japan\". So wait, salmon only comes from Japan? I thought Canada had salmon too, no? The other patrons seemed puzzled by the response, but since they'd been waiting for a while, took their seats, when offered (hope they had a better time). Another 10 minutes elapsed before the gentleman decided to take my order. Of course, after this 30 minute investment, it was another 30 minutes for my takeout order to be ready. Such a serious waste of time! Their staff also have no concept of balance, when it comes to food, either too bland or just too much bland, or just too sweet (compare the sweetened iced tea to the apple juice). Super dry bread! Seriously, run if you can, or if your friends insist on going here, tell them that you'll meet them after having a decent meal elsewhere, but be under no illusions if you want terrible service, at a hefty price, with absolutely horrible food!"}
{"text":"Je n'ai jamais vu des sandwichs aussi gros que ceux du Santropol. Du bon pain fait maison que vous pouvez aussi acheter sur place s'il est encore assez tôt dans la journée, des tartinades, souvent à base de fromage à la crème et d'autres garnitures autant traditionnelles qu'hors de l'ordinaire font de leurs sandwichs les meilleurs en ville. C'est un petit coin tout charmant, parfait pour prendre un café accompagné d'un livre ou d'un petit groupe d'amis. Allez-y tôt si c'est la fin de semaine parce que l'endroit se remplit rapidement."}
{"text":"THAT PATIO THO.  Looking to stay healthy during the summer? This place had pretty good food that is vegeterian friendly and affordable too! I took the chilli and it was slightly spicy and came with a variety of corn chips and pickled bell peppers. I also took some bites off of my friends \"Killer tomato\" sandwich and it was exactly that--yummy! I hate the feeling of an oily aftertaste in my mouth but everything tasted fresh and hit the spot.  Aside from the food though, I honestly just came here to sit at the back patio w/ the beautiful fairy lights and enjoy the surroundings while eating fresh food. Definitely a cute date spot too!"}
{"text":"We stopped here to grab some sandwiches to go have a mini-picnic at Parc du Mont-Royal.  The sandwiches were quite good.  The bread was fresh & flavorful; the fillings were unique & good combination choices.  The only thing that impeded my enjoyment was the excess of cream-cheese-based spreads.  I'm lactose-intolerant ...& I knew what I was getting into to some degree.  I just thought that the ratio of spread to veggies was a little off-kilter.  Also, bonus points for environmentally friendly takeaway containers!"}
{"text":"I love this café in the spring and summer because they have a lovely garden in the backyard. As I found out, this is a place where you should go to hang out and chat with friends when you have lots of time to spare. We ordered a piece of cake, and two drinks and although the cake arrived swiftly, the drinks took 30 minutes to make and serve. The cake of the day was very sweet."}
{"text":"I would say it's a 5 star for staff and atmosphere. It has a really magical outdoor space for the summer and the decor is eclectic in a good way.  The ingredients are fresh and bread is homemade so in theory the food should be really good but I don't think I delivered or tasted as good as it should have been.  It has a ton of vegetarian options if you are a vegetarian and the homemade bread is good.  But it lacks flavor."}
{"text":"Every time I return to Montreal (where I lived for many years) I insist on paying a visit to Santropol. Not to be confused with nearby Santropol Roulant (\"Meals On Wheels\"), this is a cozy, veg-friendly restaurant that serves ginormous, hearty sandwiches. The atmosphere is very welcoming and 'homey'. It's the type of place that's filed with old friends, artists, students and people who are introspective and contemplating life.   You can usually spot half a dozen people writing in their journals or sketching while they try to stretch their maws wide enough to accommodate the freshly baked sandwich bread. It's some sort of pumpernickel and it's soft and doughy (if you can fit it in your mouth)."}
{"text":"A great place for Sunday afternoon to chill with your family and friends. Relax and chill environment with a pond with giants gold fishes with head waterfall. You can hear the tam tam drums from a distance.  a great place to unwind. The sever Katherine was very sweet and suggest a gazpacho and with a killer tomatoes and jalapeño jam. Yummy. Overall; its a decent place to bring your friends and eat light food but a bit overpriced ."}
{"text":"Café Santropol is extremely mediocre and I honestly only go here when a vegetarian friend suggests it. The service is HORRIBLE and the food is overpriced and lacklustre. When I walked in I waited in the area that said \"please wait to be seated,\" however the waitresses kept walking by my friend and I without acknowledging us. After around 3 minutes of waiting a woman came from behind the counter and gave us menus, and didn't say a word or seat us. My friend and I eventually got the message that we should seat ourselves, and ventured inside the restaurant. The waitress that came to take our order wasn't great either, she just took our orders and gave us our food without coming by to check on us. I was parched the entire time and desperately needed a refill on my water, however the waitress was nowhere to be seen for the rest of our visit. The restaurant was nearly empty when I went and there was really no excuse for the poor service. I've been to Santropol three times before and the service has been bad in the past, but after this visit I will definitely not be going here again.   In regards to the food, it's just OK. A ham sandwich with cream cheese, lettuce, mango chutney, and a SMALL salad, should not cost 14 dollars. Period. The sandwich is mostly bread and the crust is extremely hard. I would honestly be better off just stopping at Subway and eating my sandwich at Jeanne Mance park."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch and ordered tea to start. The tea was nice and served on cute trays. We ordered for food tomato soup, chia pudding, a sandwich, and the chili. All the food was just ok except the chili. The chili was good and my friend very much enjoyed it. The rest of the food fell flat and was just ok. Not terrible, but not great. We definitely had higher expectations. The service was not good. The staff was a little rude and it was very hard to find a waitress to take our order and answer questions. Very slow. They didn't do a good job explaining their menu. Overall, this place is just ok."}
{"text":"We chose this cafe for the adorable outside terrace--shady/sunny in August and so green!  A fountain splashes in the background too.  Menu is quite limited--mostly teas, coffees, and other bevs.  We had a very satisfying breakfast:  one of us had the Eggs Florentine and added plantains and bacon to it.  Delicious poached eggs, with a chopped tomato & onion condiment.  Sauce on the side; grilled plantains were delicious and the bacon crisp.  My husband had oatmeal with poached pear and real maple syrup.  Also excellent.  The service was attentive and friendly.  Free WiFi, too.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Probably the first restaurant I went to in Montreal , the yard is very nice in summer, burger are very healthy but not too tasty in my opinion, but overall it's a nice place"}
