{"text":"Love this place ! Good food ! Pretty interior  ! Girl dream place I order  lunch combo for two $32.99! Reasonable price , came  in  1 appetizer, 2 main dish , and two drink"}
{"text":"I think this place is a bit overrated. Service were awesome. But the food does not worth that much at all. The food was too expensive. One time try is good enough."}
{"text":"Visited this cute cafe for my birthday dinner and boy, I wish I went elsewhere.  Our first table was wobbly so we asked if we could switch tables. The server said she needs to ask the manager first. Something so simple you need to ask the manager?!?  The staff themselves took up two tables in the back. They were eating while the place was almost full at around 6-7pm. I could only see two people in the kitchen. Took around 45 mins for them to make a single pasta. I've never seen restaurant staff eat during peak hours. TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT.  Halfway through waiting for our meals, someone from the kitchen came out to tell the staff outside that they were out of red sauce (I'm assuming tomato sauce). How is that possible? How can a restaurant that serves pasta not have enough sauce?!? A few minutes later the manager (I'm assuming) ran out and came back with an entire tray of sauce.  The food is tasty, but the portions aren  extremely tiny for the price. The portions are like the samples at Costco. I think I need at least 5 times the amount to be full. $16 for a sample size is definitely overpriced. The duck breast on the pasta is very thinly sliced and ONLY 4 SLICES FOR $16!  The mont blanc honey toast only had a thin layer of chestnut on the top. It looks like it's a scoop of chestnut, but it's just ice cream topped with chestnut. Notice on the plate it says \"I'm empty without them\". Exactly how I felt. I was still hungry after eating the entire pasta. But even when I finished the toast, I was still empty.  I really really really want to give this place 5 stars, but the restaurant as a whole including the management has a lot to improve."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out with friends for dessert. Everyone has to order an item.  The food was nothing special. Very expensive for the size and what it is.... But I guess you're paying for the atmosphere.  The latte is very sweet, I asked for some coffee to just dilute it and they just made me a new one instead. Still sweet... But it was fine lol.  Overall nothing special... Won't go again for that high price tag."}
{"text":"Terrible service - the service was so incredibly bad that our food never arrived.  My friends and I visited on a Friday night, looking to try the place after the much instagram hype we had seen. We were skeptical because of mixed reviews but thought, we'd give it a try. The place was half full and we thought we were in luck for a Friday night.  After placing our orders for 3 waffles, we passed the time chatting. It wasn't until we stopped chatting and noticed that 45 min had passed since we ordered. We asked for a status on our orders.  The waiter advised that they would be coming in 10 min which we replied that the table next to us had finished eating (they had arrived only a few minutes before us).   Hilariously enough, the waitress, who had originally taken order, dropped off an order slip at our table. The slip read 9.43 pm and we realized that they had literally just put the order in. They had forgot our order. Instead of apologizing, they pretended as if it was on its way.  We got up to leave and the waitress had the nerve to ask, \"You don't want your orders?\"   So, no review on food be can provided. However, based on the terrible service, I doubt the food quality and believe the poor reviews of their food."}
{"text":"Visit this place because of the cute decoration and heard from friends. Ordered a curry pork chop rice and seafood rice in tomato sauce. The portions are not big that a girl can finish the whole dish. The price is expensive compare to the portion that you are getting. The taste is not bad. The service was great and they greet you well and refill your water automatically and they don't rush you. Overall, I may come here for dessert or earlier before 8pm (Mon-Fri) for their special combo that come with drinks and a main dish with better pricing. If you just order from menu then I personally think this is a bit pricy"}
{"text":"I have been to Dazzling Cafe in Hong Kong and was so excited that they opened the same cafe here in Toronto.  When i went to the cafe, the decor of the restaurant looks the same as the one in Asia, however, the food was a disappointment.  Half of the crepe menu was marked as not available, hence there wasn't much choices on dessert.  I ordered the waffle with strawberries + ice cream.  It was ok- for sure there are dessert places out there with much better waffles. I only tried their dessert so i can't comment on their other items on the menu.  Overall i would not recommend this restaurant and i probably won't visit this restaurant again. This restaurant is not comparable to the one I visited in Hong Kong."}
{"text":"Location/Service It's in the Langham Place plaza with an outside entrance on the second level. Plenty of parking available (including underground).  Restaurant is really bright and dazzling like its name. There's a nice carousel horse by the entrance and some of the chairs have cute little bunny ears. Service - from reading reviews, it was okay for me. I can tell the waitress tried her best, but I think lacked training. She was patient, making sure she got all the orders right and was always refilling our water.  Food This place is more famous for their pasta, but I opt out and tried a Taiwanese-style fried chicken served with Japanese curry rice (quite the fusion). The dish was overall okay - chicken was fried nicely (but could be crisper), the curry felt like it was made from one of those instant boxes you find at the grocery store. The dish was close to $11-$12 - which I think didn't really justify.  I also tried their Rose Milk Tea - they had a 50% off special. It was very flavorful and strong, little bit on the sweeter side, but that could be adjusted.  I think coming here for a first try is nice. The environment, ambiance gives a nice mood - nice catch-up, chit-chat place. Food quality wise is a little mediocre - hopefully it gets better with time.  Tip: 10% off if you pay in cash!"}
{"text":"Came to this  place with my friend because I saw some cute pictures of it online! They have chairs with bunny ears and it makes the dining experience really fun! The presentation of the food is also really pretty and I would take my girlfriends here for a nice dessert hangout. The food itself is on the pricier side as there is nothing really special about it except for presentation. I shared a savoury dish and a sweet dish with my friend. I would probably come back with some friends and give their other savoury dishes a try but its not a place I would come for just the food."}
{"text":"The cute decor and everything got me! I was drawn here because of the cute bunny ear chairs. There's also a white carousel horse on display. Being inside the cafe definitely gives a princess feel.    The server gave us ample time to decide and didn't rush me which was good. They had quite a few new items on the menu so we tried those. These items caught my eye: sauteed mushrooms and shrimp, udon with beef and enoki, cream brulee chesnut latte, and the blue citrus lychee mojito. We also ordered the chicken spaghetti with spicy sauce.   Appetizer: I really enjoyed the sauteed mushrooms and shrimp. Although it was mainly mushroom, it was well seasoned with the right amount of saltiness and a bit of buttery taste. It is also topped with pea sprouts and is on a bed of greens.   Drinks: The Cream Brulee Chesnut Latte is a must try. It has a torched top that is a bit sweeter and the overall latte is the perfect taste and sweetness. Although I wasn't really able to taste any chestnut. It also comes with a butter cookie. Side note: Not sure if they mis-spelled cream for creme.  The Blue Citrus Lychee Mojito is fizzy and very nice looking with the blue and slow gradient to clear. It's topped with cubes of apple and strawberry slices as well as some mint. This drink is refreshing.   Mains:  Beef Enoki Udon was flavourful but not as aesthetically pleasing as the other food items. I feel like this is something I could make at home and not really worth going out for. However, it was still good if you're craving udon. It was tasty nonetheless.   The Chicken Spaghetti with Spicy Sauce was nicely plated. The portion was a bit small, but it was spicier than I thought. It was a good kind of spicy because it actually is spicy. The chicken was tender and small pieces.   The food was a bit slow to come. Since the portions were so small, even after the above items, it was a bit below just right for two people. We also added an order of the Orleans grilled chicken wings but it took them way too long so we just asked for it to go. It did come in a cute pastel blue and pink paper bag.   The food portions are a bit small for the price, but it makes sense for a cafe that's more about aesthetics and perfect for photo taking. It's a great place if you want some cute polaroids too! Their pillows and marble topped tables are also on point as with their take out packaging. I will be back to try their desserts! It's a great atmosphere for meeting up with your girls or afternoon tea."}
{"text":"Came here and order the lava match toast which is a complete disappointment. There was nothing running out at all and paid over 10 dollar. Could have went to a hk cafe and order their French toast and ice cream for half the price."}
{"text":"The decor of the Dazzling Cafe is quite different, although it's a bit too cutesy in my opinion. With bunny ears on their chairs, most guys would probably feel uncomfortable eating there alone. Decor aside, we tried an iced drink, a latte and the following entrees:  - Poached egg and fried chicken waffle with cheese - $12.99  - Bacon and poached egg spaghetti - $13.99  - Roasted chicken leg spaghetti with basil pesto sauce - $15.99  The waffle was a hit, as the combination worked well and it had the fluffy texture I was looking for. The roasted chicken leg spaghetti was pretty tasty, but sadly, the bacon and poached egg spaghetti was the weakest link. It was flavourful at first, but then the more you bit into it, the more salty it became.   Our friend ordered the maple syrup milk tea ($5.5), and I ordered a latte ($6.5). Based on our friend's review, the milk tea was a disappointment though I enjoyed my latte a lot. I usually like grabbing my lattes to go on the weekends, but at this price point, it's hard to justify. Alchemy offers their lattes at $4.5 with taxes in, although I must say, the latte at Dazzling Cafe had a slight edge over them in terms of controlling the temperature of the milk.  Service wise, it was pretty much a miss. There were several occasions where we made a request, and one of their waitresses, who didn't like to smile, never bother acknowledging us. We were left wondering if she had heard us, but she did end up coming back with what we asked for.     Overall, it's not a bad place to check out."}
{"text":"Service If you have read many reviews from this place, you would soon realize that the wait staff are incompetent. Do I agree? Yes, but I probably wouldn't use that word. Our waitress was quite nice, but was she fast on her feet? Maybe as fast as a sloth LOL. The washroom I used ran out of toilet paper, she said they only stored toilet paper in 1 of 2 of the washrooms, not both. Wow....what is management thinking? So she tried to come up with a solution, \"Why don't we wait until the other person comes out and I'll grab it for you?\" Cue a few minutes later, she forgot about me lols. Let's switch scenery...to the dining tables.  I found it amusing that the top napkin is nicely decorated with the Dazzling symbol but all the napkins below the surface are crappy tissue LOL. Anyhow, our waitress kept refilling our cups of water so I give her points for that. I honestly felt like she put in a lot effort, just slow at times.  Food Too pricey for what they offer. The portions may be good enough for kids/ladies/women, but definitely not enough for men. They did offer a promotion, where drinks were 50% off (selected items) and it was alright. The rose tea definitely smelled like flowers, but the scent was too strong - should tone it down a bit.  The food came on time (except for one dish), but everything was decent. I wouldn't say the food was yummy, but it wasn't barf LOL. To start, their curry sauce was actually tasty but the actual meat was a bit too tough. My pasta in my duck breast dish tasted fine, but the duck tasted like ham lols. Anyhow, nothing screamed out disgusting and yes the whole place looks amazing...like a Disney Cafe.  I don't think this place deserves such negative reviews, but I do agree that their menu is too pricey. To the restaurant: Your wait staff have no idea what it means to 'service' people. While they are putting in effort, please look at hiring people who have restaurant or even customer service experience. You can't compete with the rest of Markham by selling pasta at such high prices. You are only offering a restaurant that looks pretty with an empty soul (i.e., your food). My 2 cents. I honestly feel I lucked out because we built a good connection with the waitress, but based on what I read, most people dislike this place!"}
{"text":"My review for Dazzling Cafe is overdue so here it is.  Environment: Big windows and very nice ambiance, especially for a girls' day/night out. The decor is nice and a tad on the feminine side. But I'm not going to complain because their bunny ear chairs are the cutest thing! They also have a big carousel as a window display. Hostesses actually dress up in French maid uniforms. 4/5  Service: it was alright. Food was slow at times but the hostess did come and apologize for the wait. They could improve on this area here. 3/5  Food: I came here on two occasions and both times during lunch hours. Their menu is quite extensive, offering soups, sandwiches, pasta, rice casserole, pizza and desserts.They also have a Mon-Thurs lunch special that costs $32 + tax for a couple or 2 friends to share. You get to choose an appetizer, an entree, 2 drinks and a dessert from the selected menu. It's a decent deal for people who like to try a bit of everything in one seating. Their bacon and poached egg spaghetti was pretty tasty. The portion was definitely not worth for its price however. I felt hungry after an hour. The duck breast spaghetti with mustard orange sauce was decent but I find the duck breast was rougher to my liking. Their famous honey toast was gram-worthy and quite filling for 2 people to share. The toast could use a bit more ice cream, whip cream or sauce because towards the end it was just like eating a dry piece of bread. I also tried their red wine with wild berries crepe. It was delicious and the crepe was soft but again, not worth what you pay for. The peach rose soda drink was very refreshing on a summer day. 3/5  Overall, I'd probably come again with my girl friends because my husband would not allow himself in this restaurant. He thinks it's too unmanly for him ha-ha."}
{"text":"Will NOT return. Everything is only good for photos... Me and my friends came in a Saturday night (9pm). We were seated at a corner very soon because the store was half empty.   We arrived to the table and tried to to put our coats behind the chair but the bunny ears were in the way. The staff was beside and she stared at us but didn't advise us that there is a shelf to hang coats (as I was telling my friend not to touch the bunny ears in case they break.) I want to mention this because I saw the hanger on my way out...  My two friends each ordered a drink because each guest have to order minimum one product. We just had a big dinner so we wanted something to share.    I ordered a strawberry crepe and the wait felt long.  When it arrived it look pretty good until I tried to cut it.. The crepe taste like rubber... Each of my friends taste it and they said they said it's hard...Should have went elsewhere.   I asked the staff to take away the full plate. She took it away and did not ask how the quality the food was.   Theres a discount with paying by cash so at the end we paid cash for our bill. I tipped as well with perfect change. This is where the biggest disappointment occurred. The staff came back with an empty bill holder and said that was my change.... We went up to them and ask if we are owing money, but they look like they have no idea of what's going on. I am sure I paid the right amount because that was all the cash I have.  We decided to leave the store without waiting for their explanation."}
{"text":"My second visit here we received great and attentive service. The red bean milk tea and rose milk tea are both delicious drink options - I am a huge red bean fan so I think I preferred the RBMT more. Pasta with duck was yummy - had a bit of orange zest to it that complimented the dish very well. I only wished the portions for food were bigger. Very cute and Instagrammable cafe. I would go again! Maybe I will try the other location for a change :) Thank you Dazzling Cafe!"}
{"text":"I was super excited they opened this cafe here. The decor is super cute which i love! The service is excellent and when we went, it wasn't overly crowded. I ordered the dessert because it just looks too good! I got the strawberry waffle with the whipped cream. It's soooooooo good! But then again, you can't go wrong with waffle and whipped cream!   My friend tried the Waffle chicken, which I tried a bit and it was good!   I would come back to try other food. However, the price is a bit high though."}
{"text":"To be honest, I came here for the first time not having very high expectations of the food. I had the impression that it was just a cutely decorated place where people would want to have tea,  lattes, or a light snack. I'm not saying the food was amazing, but it was better than what I had expected. From what I hear, this cafe originated from Asia and has locations in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and now Canada. I haven't been to the other locations, but my friend mentioned that the food was definitely better in Hong Kong from her personal experience. Located in the Langham Square on Kennedy that's known for it's many parking spots (sarcasm), have fun looking for a spot with so many restaurants, stores, and a T&T supermarket that share this parking lot.    Through the glass doors, there were white sofa seats along one wall of the restaurant and many chairs with bunny ears everywhere. The decor is definitely one of the marketing tactics they use to attract customers to eat there. It worked for my friend who successfully persuaded me to go with her, but I think experiencing this place once would be enough.  We were a party of 3 and ordered the Rose Lychee Soda, the Dazzling Cafe Milk Tea, the Rose Latte, the Mentaiko Spaghetti with Cream Sauce, the Hawaiian Bacon Pizza, the Seafood Rice Casserole with Tomato Sauce, and finally the Red Wine and Wild Berry Crepe. I got a sip of my friend's soda and it tasted like a combination of rose and lychee flavoured Yakult with a little bit of carbonation. It wasn't too sweet and a little lighter than your usual Yakult drink that comes in a mini plastic bottle. I had the Dazzling Cafe Milk Tea which was served in a decent sized teapot that poured 3-4 cups of tea. I've tasted better milk tea before, so it wasn't anything special. I can say the same for the Rose Latte. Other than the fact that there was a light rose scent to it and that it was nicely decorated with mini flower petals, a nice latte art design on top, and served with a mini biscuit on the side, it wasn't anything special.   Now onto the food. I enjoyed the Seafood Rice Casserole with Tomato Sauce the most out of all the other menu items we ordered. It was very flavourful in comparison to the other two. The Hawaiian Pizza was mediocre with a thin crust and very few toppings and sauce. As for the Mentaiko Spaghetti with Cream Sauce, the pollock roe gave the spaghetti its colour and you definitely feel the texture of the roe when you're eating it. It could have been a little creamier with more sauce but it wasn't too bad. Last but not least the Red Wine and Wild Berry Crepe was good. There are other dessert places that serve thinner crepes, but it wasn't bad.   Overall the dining experience wasn't bad. The service was good, but I've definitely tasted better food."}
{"text":"For this location, I will give it a 3.5. The seating I feel like the Yonge and Shepard location better, more spacious. A few babies crying when I was there so it was difficult to enjoy my meal.   There was a Taiwanese snack basket which I didn't see at the other location with the Taiwanese sausage, squid balls and taro balls. The squid balls and Taiwanese fish balls were not bad.  The pasta with the egg, I think the other location tasted better. We order the truffle mushroom pizza, it tasted similar as the other location. But I think depending on where I am I will go back to the Yonge and Shepard location."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because of the cute design and cute desserts just to find out that each person at your table needs to buy something on the menu... If you go as a couple, you can't order one thing and share it... Which is unfortunate. Overall the service was good and the food was good. A bit pricey but it was a nice experience..."}
{"text":"The decor is cute (a bit too cute) the staff is friendly, but food is a bit overpriced for very small portions (tho it does taste good, but wish it was larger) the drinks are well made (but not sure if they have tapioca pearls or any additional toppings available)   The plaza is good, lots of parking if you use the underground parking, t&t supermarket in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Only a 3 due to cute decor of the restaurant. Featured cute bunny chairs and white cushioned booths. I wouldn't recommend coming here again. The food was 2/3 more of a quick bite restaurant as the meals were small and not filling. I tried a few things on the menu and thought the chicken pesto pasta was probably the best. Staff were dressed like Japanese waitress which was kind of cool."}
{"text":"At first glance the decor is amazing, it gives a retro diner vibe. All's good until you realize the giant bunny ears on certain chairs, which totally ruined everything. Unless you are a kid, in which case many enjoyed as they thought they were funny/cute.   As for the food, I ordered the duck pesto pizza, strawberry honey toast and the montblanc waffles. The duck pesto pizza was actually quite enjoyable although slightly undercooked underneath, yet flavours worked really well together. Things were looking pretty decent until desserts came out, where I had an awkward interaction with the waitress when she offered to cut the strawberry honey toast for me. She seemed nice so I thought sure why not, maybe there's a right way to cut into these. I just stared at her blankly when all she did was cut the front end of the toast to reveal cut up strips of toast, but then she takes a piece and she places it on my personal plate which still had pesto sauce on it. The worst was yet to come, the montblanc waffles soon followed, and let me tell you. This is, by far, one of the worst dessert I have ever had. The taste was just so odd and so bitter, bitter chestnuts just have no place on a dessert.  My final thoughts on this restaurant is that it is greatly overpriced for a mediocre experience. Eat at your discretion."}
{"text":"I must admit that I was drawn to this place after seeing how cute this place looks. After all, how many cafes can boast having bunny ears on their chairs, a carousel horse on display, and some pretty tasty looking dishes? Seemed like a perfect place to take my niece and nephew for dinner and dessert.  We ordered Taiwanese popcorn chicken for my niece and nephew. Hubby ordered the spicy chicken spaghetti which he said wasn't bad. He also enjoyed the popcorn chicken for overall flavour. I found my spaghetti bolognese with cheese lacking in cheese and packing a bit more of a kick than I anticipated. I had originally wanted to order the recommended chicken leg with pesto spaghetti but later changed to the spaghetti bolognese as I thought this would be more palatable for my nephew. We also ordered a kiwi juice which both kids enjoyed. We shared a strawberry with ice cream waffle. The dessert was a good sharing size and taste-wise was the highlight of our meal.  Service was okay but not stellar. One of the service staff insisted on speaking Mandarin to us even though we repeatedly spoke to them in English. Where this place excels is through their very Instagram-worthy appearance. Unfortunately it falls a bit short of my expectations of overall quality of food and service. I would recommend coming here mainly for a limited selection of their desserts and for the opportunity to hangout and take a few fun photos in the visually appealing space."}
{"text":"Dazzling Cafe officially opens in Markham today (August 25th). Their new flagship restaurant has opened up in Langham Square plaza, near Hwy 7 & Kennedy. This is their 3rd location in Canada    I went to check out the new Dazzling Cafe today on Grand Opening Day. The cafe is quite chic and coquettish and retains the decor from their original location in North York. The famous rabbits ears are prominent and I love the encrusted fake diamonds found on their white sofa against the wall. The white horse also isnt missing in action and can be found at the front  of their resto. I was also trying to spot their one of a kind Hello Kitty but I couldn't see it. Hopefully,  Hello Kitty can appear soon   As for the food and drinks, I was hoping to order the Mango Honey Toast and take advantage of their special promo free Drink after seeing so many great pics on IG but alas, the Mango Honey Toast  was only available for a special limited time and is not a regular item on their menu. Bummer.  I settled for my favourite dish: the Chicken Pesto Pasta which is a must dish to try and I think one of the more substantial dish though at $16, it is quite expensive.  And finally, I got a chance to try their egg and fried chicken waffle. This is my third attempt trying to order this dish.  First time, I was told their waffle machine wasn't working. Second time, they told me they ran out of fried chicken at 7pm??  So today I was delighted I got to try it and though this dish is found in their waffle section, I consider it more of a savoury dish than a sweet dish. Btw not sure if I was the first table to order waffle today. The dish took a good 20 mins to make.  The free drink I ended up trying the Hazelnut Milk Tea. It wasn't too sweet and it will be something I would go for it again. Can't wait to visit again and try some of their newer items.  Currently for their Grand Opening special, they have a promotion: Get a FREE drink with your order of any entrée (pasta or rice dish) or Honey Toast! Free drinks include choice of Honey Green Tea, Vanilla Milk Tea, Hazelnut Milk Tea, Caramel Milk Tea or Americano. Limit one per customer. Offer valid at their Markham location only until August 31st.   Service was good. Their staff can speak English, Mandarin or Cantonese.  Overall verdict: I would go back."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review from a 3-star to a 1-star review after my experience at Dazzling Cafe, Markham location. My friends and I had the worst dinner experience here.   My friends and I came here for dinner - all my friends got their meals except for one of my friends and I. Turns out our meals were missed by the servers, that's fine - we waited for our food, thinking they would follow up with the kitchen about the missed orders.   We think the server forgot to re-enter our meals again because it took a total of 1.5 hours for us to get our meals when we saw so many meals for other tables come out during this time period. We had to follow up with them 2-3 times before they actually took action on something that they've missed. We were so disappointed!!   The misadventures at Dazzling Cafe doesn't end here... When we got our bills the first time, the server realized she didn't include a drink in our FIRST bill. She came back with the SECOND bill and my boyfriend paid for that, with tips (even though we've waited for such a long time, we decided to pay the tips anyways... I kind of regret this now to be honest lol).   We thought we were done with this but the server came back the THIRD time because apparently she forgot another one of our drinks in the bill. That's when we got even more upset with the service. Not that we were expecting a compensation for this mishap or anything, but at least the manager should be part of this conversation if the server has messed up at least 5 times in one night to speak with us and apologize for this experience? No one owned up to anything in this situation!   I've shared my experience with other friends / foodies and they've all agreed that they've experienced similar situations at the Markham location. We were very disappointed in Dazzling Cafe!! We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food and drink were not bad in terms of taste. Size is very small for the main course. We had a few different pasta and pizza. I guess they want you to leave room for the dessert. For the dessert, its more for the looks. The taste or ingredients are nothing special. Overall, I think its a little overpriced for what they give you. Its a nice atmosphere with cute bunny ears chairs."}
{"text":"Cute decor, yummy desserts, not much else to say. Place was dead at 5:30pm, but service was still really slow."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a waitress in French maid uniform right when we stepped in.  This place is elegant; and with nice ambience.  We had the seafood with pesto sauce pizza and the lava chocolate crispy toast to share.  The pizza was small and it's just good for a person.  The crust was thin and crunchy.  There were generous amount of seafood and it's favorable.  The sugar toast isn't as heavy as it looks; and it's delish.  Coffee is good as well.  It's a nice place for a light lunch and afternoon tea."}
{"text":"This review is for the orange duck breast pasta and rose milk tea only.  I have been longing and wanting to go to this cute cafe for the longest time since it opened, and I finally got to go....  Servers seems to only speak Mandarin and English only and greeted me and my friends politely and allowed us plenty of time to decide what we wanted, however did not recommend us anything. It's fine which I can just select it myself since menu is full of pictures anyways :D.  I love the decor of this place as it was very cute. The time I went was during lunch time and I was amazed it wasn't pack as each time I come by is full from the outside view. They definitely done well with the decor since it lured me in.  Orange duck breast pasta taste yummy in my opinion, tangy sauce, well seasoned duck breast, and beautiful presentation! Just the portion was a bit small, however I don't mind it since it was for lunch only.  Rose milk tea was delicious as it wasn't too sweet and it accompanying of some drive rose petals, presentation was also on point.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience here with my friends, we stayed probably a bit over 1 hour since we stayed for lunch and wanted to catch up together while having our drinks.   They got wifi :D I forgot to take down the password but the information is on your table under the menu that is set on the table :D  It only missed 1 star due to the fact that their food portion was too small for the pricing. I would come back to try their other items, will update in the future."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night and here is my review to Dazzling Cafe. The service was excellent. Server welcomed us warmly. There's nothing to complain about the service. Food tasted good but the portion was too small. Now, one thing that I strongly dislike is when you can smell the smoke from the kitchen while you're eating. They don't have anything to isolate the kitchen from the dinning area, so you can literally see the smoke coming out from the kitchen and all surrounded in the dinning area. When I finished dining at this place, I smelled like I had Korean barbeque. Price is over priced like what other said. Overall, it's an alright place."}
{"text":"I personally didn't have a good dining experience when I came here on a Friday night. My friend had been to one in Hong Kong and she had nothing but good things to say.  The restaurant was full when we walked in and we waited around 5 mins to get a table.  Stepping in the restaurant I had a good first impression. The decor was very cute and the theme reminded me of Alice in the wonderland.  However, once we ordered the food, everything went downhill. My friends and I ordered the $12.99/$32.99 combos.  The $12.99 combo comes with a drink and an entree whereas the $32.99 combo is for two people that serves an app, two entrees + 2 drinks. The drinks arrived on time and they tasted okay. Nothing outstanding but it wasn't terrible either.  My friends got their apps and entrees at a decent time whereas I waited another 20-25 minutes for my meal. My friends had almost finished their meal and I was still there waiting to eat. I had asked the servers multiple times about the status of my order and they were not doing much to accommodate the inconvenience. I got no apologies. I was just told they were busy. The staff seemed overwhelmed and a little disorganized that night as it was a full house but I felt like they could've done more to serve their customers better.  Anyways, I finally got my food and it was mediocre at best. The wait and lack of response from the staff was already bad enough, but to get a dish so underwhelming made the experience even worse. I almost didn't give tips to the waiter as they didn't do much for me that night at all.  This will be my first and last visit."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was almost empty. Decor was nice and main courses were fine. We were quite happy with our food and service.... and then dessert happened. We ordered the Mont Blanc pancake and the plate was quite pretty. A few bites in and realized it was undercooked. The batter was raw, the egg white was raw.... so we decided to send it back and see if they could fix it. Waiter came back with the same plate and said the chef insisted the pancake was well done. So we flipped the top off and show the waiter the raw center (batter still runny) and he tried to talk to the chef again. Unfortunately the chef insisted it was well done so there was nothing the waiter could do. So we ate the ice cream side and left the raw pancakes. It was 10.99$ for three runny pancakes. Anyway not sure we would ever go back as the main course was fine and the pancake was an execution issue. However the chef's attitude is kinda hard to swallow... so be aware."}
{"text":"i'm actually okay with the food here EXCEPT it's horrifically overpriced. all the drinks here are $7.50 with only one drink at $4.50 which is the expresso but obviously i didn't want that at 11pm on a weekday so i opted for a \"clouthie\" as there is a rule of one order per person so i was coerced to order a drink. the clouthie was really artificial and was pure sugar, yuck! having said that, i tried the mont blanc waffle, green tea & red bean souffle pancakes, mushroom pizza and chocolate banana crepe. they were all good especially the pancakes HOWEVER!!! the low rating is due to their lack of professionalism. my friends and i were trying to figure out a place to have dessert at 10:30 but most places were closed already but dazzling markham indicated operating hours until midnight. we headed over and arrived at 10:55 pm. the store was empty and almost looked closed but they were open. so HERES THE KICKER, as we were approaching the store and entering, the whole store was looking at us with expressions of disbelief. especially this one girl behind the bar who had a \"are-you-f*ing-kidding-me-you-guys-are-coming-right-before-last-call-i-was-looking-forward-to-go-home-early\" FACE!! she LITERALLY had her mouth half hanging open in shock while staring at us and was mouthing something to herself for a good few minutes. then we sat down and learned that their last call was at 11:00 pm. we sat down at 10:55 pm therefore we got cut eyes/disapproving stares from all their staff which made us feel extremely uncomfortable!! they CLEARLY showed that they were all looking forward to going home early but we shattered their hopes because we wanted to give them business. le SIGH. if you are listed to be open until midnight, you best be prepared to serve customers until that time."}
{"text":"Been to this famous franchise from Taiwan in other countries, i was super excited when they came to Toronto!   Paid my visit at the new markham store on a Saturday night. And I got seated right away (my last experience at the Hong Kong store consisted of a 45min line up before we go seated and was limited to a 2 hr seating). Looked through the menu and i wasnt too impressed. A lot of the items i liked in the hk location wasnt on this menu. We went ahead and ordered two desserts to share and a drink. There is a mandatory 1 order per person.   What i ordered:  Strawberry waffle Matcha fried toast Passion fruit tea   The two desserts were okay. Dont think i would order them again though. But i loved the passion fruit tea. It came in a pot infused with fruits! Perfect amount of sweetness. Served with a small little tea cup with fruits inside. I wanted to share so i asked for another cup and  they also put fruits in the extra cup. That was nice of them.   As for the service, the serves didnt speak english that well, so i offered to speak mandarin and she was glad i did lol their closing time was 12am on a saturday, but they made their last call at before it hit 11pm. Groups of people walked it at around 11pm and got turned down. But at around 11:25pm a group a 6 walked in and they took them in. I found that kinda rude... and unfair. But yea, nice place to chit chat, not my first few picks tho."}
{"text":"It just didn't feel like Dazzling Cafe ever got it going in this plaza. The interior was flashy, and was unique, but the leather chairs became worn incredibly fast. The most important thing to me though, was the food, and it just wasn't quite up to par. The pesto pasta with the roast chicken was quite oily, and their brick toast with chocolate was tough to eat without a beverage. The saving grace were their promotional deals, though without them, prices were unjustifiable."}
{"text":"I was excited when I found out Dazzling is coming to Markham.  I've never try The Yonge st location, it is very difficult for parking and with all the traffics on Yonge/Sheppard, So here I am, can't wait to try this place.  I actually went to Dazzling Markham two times before I wrote this review.  The first time I went with a girlfriend, we ordered drinks (recommended on the menu), Pasta and we ordered the Toast (New Must Try Item on the menu).  The Drink is overly sweet. The pasta taste good to me, but the portion is too small for any guys. ( Do not bring your boyfriend) The Toast is $11.99 ( if I still remember correctly), way over price for a French toast with cheese in the middle. 2nd time I went with two guys, they were still hungry after a full meal of appetizer/main course/dessert This time we ordered Pizza. My friends were surprised to see a pizza that only size of my hand that cost $10.99, and with a super super thin crust.  The dessert this time we ordered chicken waffle (recommended on the menu); after first bite, we were all wondering what is executive chef thinking when he made this dish the Recommended item on his menu. The taste and the texture of the waffle was awful, not fluffy, soft inside with a crispy outside; and they topped some salad on top of the chicken nugget, the dressing of the salad does not go well with the chicken and the waffle.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"A new dessert place in markham but they also serve regular food like pasta and pizza.  I enjoyed their Mochi waffle which was delish and they also knock 10 percent off our bill for my sisters birthday which was super sweet.  The staff is also super nice."}
{"text":"Bunny ears on chairs? That's the kind of aesthetics that we like here in Markham.   Came on a Friday during lunch time and it wasn't busy at all. It is tucked into Langham Square on the upper level close to Cool N2. I think this used to be where Deer Cafeteria is? Not 100%. Place is quite spacious and with all the pink/white/black furniture and it is definitely *dazzling.*   They had a grand opening promotion where you can order any rice, noodle, or honey toast and get a free milk tea/tea/coffee. This was a good deal as the prices for those were about $5 each.   I opted for the poached egg and bacon spaghetti thing while my friend had the chicken leg spaghetti dish. At Dazzling they had the regular HK cafe dishes and lots of options which is what I like. Why this place is a 3 in my opinion was because the food felt home cooked to me? I felt I could have made something similar at home and the prices were higher that the usual HK cafe fares. My dish from what I remember was $13~ and my friends was $16~. We also tried the hazelnut and caramel milk tea. It comes in a tall glass with no tapioca. The hazelnut is definitely better than the caramel, but would I spend $5.50 on it? No. I would rather go to a proper BBT shop.   Being a newly opened store, I will forgive some service issues. Service was kind of chickens without heads as they were very kind but all over the place and not that attentive. My dish also came 15 minutes after my friends and I saw another table receive their dish before me even though we sat before them, which was kind of annoying.   I do want to try the honey toast in the future as I heard that's what they're known for. I will probably give it another chance but for now, a 3/5 it shall stay. I will update if they improve! /end essay"}
