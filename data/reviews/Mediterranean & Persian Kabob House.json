{"text":"Honestly the food is amazing. I get the salari kabob always. The chicken and beef is perfectly cooked. Tender and flavourful and they give you so much!! It's always so so fresh and I really love the sauces they give you too.

It always blows my mind how when I go home and eat my leftover 3-4 hours later, the meat is still juicy and delicious. Amazing. Quality AND quantity the best of both worlds.

Oh and by the way- I'm not family or a friend, in response to another review lol"}
{"text":"My 5th time coming here and it still amazes me. I wish I knew about it earlier. I always order the 'SALARI' which has 1 skewer of koobideh beef kabob, 1 skewer of chicken breast, rice and salad for $12.99 -a very good deal

I forgot to take a picture because I dove right in. 
I really want to explore the menu some more but I also don't want to stop having what I always have because it's soo delicious! The restaurant itself is nothing too fancy but spacious.

The prices are good, very generous portions. Meats are flavourful and tender. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The owner or whatever is a super rip off kinda guy. The wrap was so sad and falling apart. THEY LITTERALLY HAD NO CHICKEN. So he cut some off the stick and fried it. Than for 2 small wraps he charged us $18. And I'm like it's $5.99 and he like u got a drink and I'm like u don't even sell nestle water I brought that from home and he was fighting us than gave us a $1.25 in quarters. Such a a**hole. I'll never go back. Also I saw a black bug run across the floor"}
{"text":"i have been to many persian places for food. This by far is the best. Its always fresh and the  kabobs are always marinated and cooked to perfection. The service is also very friendly and they have renovated to make it look better as well. Recommend for anyone looking for great food"}
{"text":"Mediocre food.  Decor is not great, food is just okay.  Been here twice and no one else was here.  Not sure how they stay open.  It's a big place.  Sorry, but two stars might be generous on my part.  I think these others reviewing are family or friends."}
{"text":"Heard about this restaurant from a friend and heard it took awhile to get the order since they make your food right away after you order.  So I decided to order over the Sharwarma Plate and the Koobideh combo over the phone.  They told me it takes about 15 minutes when I ordered the food.  I left my house after about 5-10 minutes and when I arrived the food was ready as they had promised.  Service was great, and the food was delicious. Lots of creamy sauce to go with the chicken shawarma plate, and the koobideh skewers were marinated to perfection!. I would definitely come back for more soon."}
{"text":"Passed by here several times and finally decided to give it a try.

I ordered the koobideh combo (2 skewers of koobideh, rice, tomato, onions and salad) ($8.99+tax). The portion was plenty, the meat was deliciously marinated and they give two very sour sauces that were delicious (one was a salad dressing, the other had a little kick to it)!

Overall, I will definitely be back for more.. especially it being so close to home! The only thing was that there is only one gentleman working there running the cash and preparing the food at the same time..so service is a little slow.

PS. They accept credit cards!! +1"}
{"text":"This is now twice that I've went to this restaurant at around 10:30 and it was closed. The business hours say it is open until 11 pm. Fix your business hours please as it is very misleading. I've wasted my gas and time to come to a restaurant with the lights off 30 minutes before close..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for mishandled food, this is the place. 

I threw my food out after watching them make it because I knew I was going to get sick eating it. 

I feel bad, this is clearly a family run joint, but they have no business serving food like this. The place is empty for a reason."}
