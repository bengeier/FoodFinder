{"text":"a solid sushi joint! it has a 20% off deal going monday thru wednesday (if i'm not mistaken) which makes it a nice early week pick-me-up.  

the restaurant itself is cute and tiny.  the food is good and arrives quickly; and once i splurged on the ice cream tempura dessert, and it was deeeelish."}
{"text":"This is the second oldest Sushi Bar in Calgary. 
Stop by and say hi to Chef Kenji. This place is dynamite."}
{"text":"I live right by this sushi place and cant tell you how many times i looked right past it not thinking much. It has got to be the best sushi and service I have ever had while out for sushi. My husband has a shrimp allergy and they were extremely accommodating. We also had a huge tray of tempura and -wait for it- mochi ice cream! Man i didn't know such heavenly ice cream existed until now! And to add to the atmosphere, they had hilarious Japanese game shows playing by the chefs which added to the entertainment lol! 
They were more than fair in their price too- we had a plate of tempura, sake, 4 rolls or so and desert and it was less than $30. Great date night , awesome food, and a great price!"}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoyed this place.  After eating horrendous AYCE sushi just the night before, we went here to get a decent sushi meal to address the situation.  While the portions are all a bit smaller than you'd expect for the price, the quality is amongst the best we've had. The sashimi and rolls were all very tasty, as was teh mochi ice cream (probably worth the trip just to have the ice cream).  

The good thing about the higher price is that just the act of trying to stay within your budget will ensure that you eat an appropriate amount.  Relative to the AYCE, we saved $20 for the meal and the quality was infinitely better.  If you want a lot of (great quality) sushi, just spend the equivalent amount at Sushi-Bar Miki and you'll be better off for it.

My only complaint with this place is the size and the ambiance - brightly lit and cafeteria-like chairs/tables.  It somewhat cheapens the place, when it is totally top notch.  As well, take note: this place is pretty tight for space, so large groups are not recommended."}
{"text":"This is a small, traditional Japanese restaurant with good quality fish and nice presentations.  I only wish the sashimi portion sizes were a bit larger!"}
{"text":"I started going to this Japanese restaurant about 25 years ago. It was one of the few we had in the city at the time. I was able to say, that I had been to every Japanese restaurant in the city. Fast forward 25 years, and we now have 100's of sushi bars etc. I don't even try and keep up with the new ones anymore.
I came in here for the first time in years and see that not much has changed. I saw the owner behind the sushi bar (Kenji) and he still remembers me.
The d√©cor itself is pretty much the same. If you use the restroom,  the hallway leading to it is  covered with pics of celebrities, and sports celebs. most of Japanese ancestry.
Now on to the food. They have taken  my favorite dish off the menu, (okonomiyaki). Its a Japanese pizza for the sake of getting into the details.
The prices have obviously gone up since the last visit, and the food wasn't as tasty as I had remembered. The sushi was good, the other items were just OKAY. The items we tried on this particular visit were chicken karaage, tempura udon, California rolls, tamago sushi, chicken teriyaki. I had yakisoba, it wasn't very authentic tasting. The chicken teriyaki was good, but they don't serve it on a hot plate anymore. It's served on a white triangular shaped plate, which makes the presentation seem bland.
There are a lot of Japanese restaurants open in Calgary now, and this one is just to far away from my home to justify going to.

One more thing I'd like to add to my review. I was a good customer back in the day, and had returned to my former stompin grounds for J food. I thought he could have thrown in a couple pieces of FREE sushi or something to show his gratitude.
I don't know about you, but I like when a business owner shows his appreciation by giving a freebie. A great example of this would be Kinjo's, where they give you a free sushi sampler plate, and Pocky's to finish your meal.  I keep going back there.

Don't think I'll be back to Miki's anytime soon. 

Food is just OKAY, not GREAT!"}
{"text":"sushi-bar miki is one of the best long-standing sushi spots in the city, complete with celebrity photos requisite to any good japanese restaurant.

the lunch combos are reasonably priced and delicious. sushi, tempura, and teriyaki are all good here."}
{"text":"A short walk from my office, and in the middle of nowhere on 16th Ave is this awesome japanese restaurant. I've been here countless times now, and have never been disappointed. 

Their sashimi is surprisingly fresh, and their teriyaki is YUM! They have 2 or 3 item lunch combos at $12 or $16. And nowadays they also have these $15 sushi combos, all of which are fantastic.

The decor is pretty, and we are always served by the same friendly waitress. Thank goodness we have this great restaurant in Montgomery, or else I'd be fast out of decent lunch options!"}
{"text":"It's been four years since my last visit to Miki and my friend and I decided to give them a try again to see if it's still a good place for sushi.  Last time I noted that the food was generally decent but prices were on the higher side.  This time however... ok.  If you're going to charge very high prices, higher than most other places, you better be really good.  I mean you better stand out from everyone else.  However I have never actually heard anyone I know talk about this restaurant...

Here's what we tried tonight:

Seafood Salad - $10.00

Miki's menu doesn't actually have much of a description following the food item so I asked the server if this was a sashimi salad.  I was told it was, but the only piece of raw fish was a tiny piece of red snapper.  This actually tasted ok but way too overpriced for what it is.  And I was expecting a large green salad - but there were maybe only half a cup of spring mix.  I was very disappointed with the lack of greens and would've ordered a regular green salad and the large order of sashimi had I known this was what I was receiving.

Miki Special Age Tofu - $7.00

This is just an order of agedashi tofu with the addition of one tempura prawn and two slivers of tempura avocado.  The dashi was actually quite flavorful and I love that they included a thing of grated daikon and ginger.  The batter was not too thick or greasy.  However the portion was definitely tiny.

Medium Selection of Sashimi - $25.00

An okay selection of fresh sashimi, but tiny slices.  One thing I was surprised about was that there was a small puddle of water underneath the fish.  Was it from the shredded radish...? Was the sashimi literally defrosting on my plate...? Not that it affected the taste but aesthetically, it didn't look great at all.  Also felt like it was carelessness.

Medium Selection of Nigiri - $20.00

My friend ordered this didn't have much to say about it.  Our favorite Roku charges only $16 for pretty much the same selection and they have hamachi in their's.

Chicken Yaki-Udon - $12.00

Got this for the kiddies to share.  They ate it without complaints but my friend thought the portion was on the small side.

California Roll - $4.75; Special Scallop Nigiri/Sashimi - $3.25

You know, I really prefer when places take the time to chop up the fake crab and mix it with mayo.  Like what my friend said, there's just something about a Cali roll that should be creamy.  And if you're not going to give me a mixture then you shouldn't charge me so much for it.  This was quite dry and kept falling apart.  By the way, we had wanted the one with masago but it was $2.25 more.  Every other place charges maybe only $0.50 more.

Our meal came to $94.50 before tip and we left rather unsatisfied.  I don't understand why Miki charges such high prices for pretty average food (imho).  I can safely say the chances of us returning are pretty slim.  Regurgitating what I said in my Gohan post, you can definitely get better Japanese food for less at many other places..."}
{"text":"Cozy, intimate feel. Friendly staff. Awesome sushi. Good value for lunch, especially 2-item and 3-item combos at $12 and $16 respectively which includes a hot entree (e.g. salmon or chicken teriyaki with rice, prepared with just the right balance of sweet/salty) and sushi or sashimi or both, with salad and miso soup included. Been here several times, and I keep coming back - it's walking distance from my office, bonus!"}
{"text":"This place makes me happy. Has an authentic Japanese sushi bar feel that's not often found in Calgary. 
Cozy interior with a realistic Japanese atmosphere. Often only one chef and one server, both are the owners (I think), so you know they care and you know they try to do things right for you!
The walk to the bathroom is a treat - a little walk down memory lane as they have many autographed photos from athletes who competed in the Calgary 88' Games, and also some of those athletes who frequented the restaurant outside of that time. Hint - many Japanese athletes also! I think that says a lot. 
Food is superb in my opinion."}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough.
It's not a bad part of town but there isn't much going on in this slightly dilapidated strip mall. 
So it's a total shock to discover a nice little sushi place with such great food.
The decor isn't amazing but the food is great. A total pleasant surprise!
You can even order large format meals like hot pot for a small group. 
The service is really friendly and the people are lovely."}
{"text":"This is a nice and tranquil neighbourhood sushi bar that serves fresh fish and good tea. I wish the menu had some less variety of cooked food and more sushi, as it is after all a sushi bar. 

The restaurant reminds me of a small sushi bar with few tables that you can find in a typical Tokyo subway station. The look and feel are very authentic."}
