{"text":"Tucked away in the ever-so-ghetto plaza of Rambler Drive is Quickie's. To be fair, it has been a little bit since I've been there, so I can't say with total confidence that it's still there, what with all the crazy changes that plaza has had over the last year.  Anyway, this spot used to rock when The Place (bar) used to be located next to it, and would remain open late for drunk burger-gobblers and the like. I may be wrong, but I think being located next to a Caribbean buffet instead probably doesn't work in their favour.  I've done Quickie's a few times, and I've never had my skirt blown up. Pretty much everything on the menu is average (the usual sub/burgers/fries takeout fare), the service is a little slow (if polite), and the place itself is kind of dirty.  Now, I'm not expecting anything spectacular at the Newfie ground zero (I lived there for a time as a non-Newf outsider), but there were always better alternatives nearby.  There are a couple of bonuses to this place. It is open late (I believe until midnight), and if I'm not mistaken, they also deliver.  You can find so much better in B-town these days, but you could also do a lot worse. Much like a typical quickie, I want more, damn it. I have needs."}
{"text":"For a burger it would be worth your time to travel up the road to Sonny's. Super friendly owners and good amount of food for a really decent price, but nothing special... One interesting menu option - East coast special.  Which is fries and gravy with ground beef.  My mom used to make this for us when we were kids, so it might be nostalgia speaking, but I liked that."}
{"text":"Take the lowest cost frozen food from a discount store, add a deep frier, and you've duplicated this place. I would choose any other option. They do have a delivery car though if you literally have no other options and are opposed to just eating ice cubes from your freezer (Seriously, that's a better choice - these folks can't fry fries)."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place still exists! it opened about 1997 but with different owners, they were Greek. The burgers were excellent, fries were good too. Portions were large and service was friendly and prices were great. I used to go at least once a week.  Then new ownership came in. I went there 3 times after. It was never the same. Burger was overcooked. Give it another try a year later and wasn't good at all.  One late Saturday night I was on my way home and was HUNGRY. There was Quickies Fast Food a block away from me while driving. I ordered some Onion Rings (I had a craving). I might as well of just ordered a bottle of oil because that is what was I had, oil rings. After two I threw them out.  Sorry to all of you who never got to get the chance to have this food when it was top notch. Maybe the people in that area go there because it is easy to get to. I think the locals over there are keeping them alive. Mc Donalds kicks their butt and that says something........"}
