{"text":"A beautifully done, simple dinner of chopped salad, lamb, filet, au gratin potatoes, asparagus and wine. I'm particular about how food is prepared, and every dish was done perfectly. And our server \"Patsy\" was a pro. Wine list has a nice range of selections. Only negative was smell of smoke drifting in through entrance. But food was so good it didn't matter. So glad I took my wife here for a special birthday dinner."}
{"text":"The Charcoal seems to have an identity issue. The food is consistently good, although they may need to find another fish supply. This restaurant suffers from the same malady at times as other food outlets at Santa Fe = shortage of staff, which seems almost chronic. Lately, the Charcoal has employed a singer, strumming a guitar, and proudly singing what I would classify as college songs. C'mon......  Everyone seems to ask the hostess for the back of the restaurant when they walk in and hear him bleating out these ole dorm classics. Charcoal room....... maybe send him packing to Cabos, dim the lights 1/3, kill the music down to 10 decibels and make it a classier place to eat. Still, music or not....great food, usually great service..."}
{"text":"Had dinner here a few times. I love the Lamb Chops. Caesar salad is good. Excellent customer service. Waiter came to our table often. Positive and relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"he Charcoal Room at Santa Fe Station is where we come when we want more of an upscale steakhouse without breaking the bank. Since it's not far from the house, we usually try to get up here every other month or so. The meals and service are always outstanding.  The restaurant is tucked away in a corner of the casino not far from where the front doors used to be before the casino underwent many of its makeovers. You might not expect a local's casino such as this to have a fine dining establishment, but the Charcoal Room has survived when many of the other eateries that aren't in the food court have come and gone. One complaint is that the dress code has gone down somewhat over the past few years. It used to be business/dressy, but it seems that we see a lot more people in here dressed in shorts and t-shirts. However, they're usually seated toward the front doors or the bar area, so the good seating in the back is a bit more refined and romantic (except for the TV over the fireplace).  Although it has seldom been busy when we've gone, reservations would be recommended on Friday and Saturday nights. Request a table or booth in the back of the restaurant to avoid the noise of the bar and the flow of people coming and going. When arriving, we've never had to wait more than a minute or two until the hostess took us back to our table. Once seated, the waiter stops by the table promptly to introduce himself and take your drink order. They have a large selection of wine, so if you're planning on having wine with the dinner and aren't sure what to order, don't hesitate to ask the waiter or sommelier. They'll listen to your wine preferences and recommend a few wines that will pair well with your planned meal. They don't push the most expensive wine or the one with the biggest profit margin. We've found some good wines that we normally wouldn't have picked out.  We always begin our meal with a starter and can heartily recommend the stuffed Portobello mushrooms, crab cakes, bacon wrapped shrimp, or the bacon wrapped scallops. We usually choose the scallops and they're always perfectly cooked. Since this is a steakhouse, we don't change our order that much on each visit. I usually have the pan-seared ribeye and Brenda gets either the petite or full size filet mignon depending on her appetite. The steaks are always cooked to what you order. We don't have to order our steak rare to get one that is medium rare like some establishments. Dining is a la carte, so your sides are additional. The grilled asparagus, baked potato and garlic mashed potatoes are all tasty. They don't have the garlic mashed potatoes on the menu, but the chef will usually whip some up for you.  During the meal, the wait staff checks on you often enough to make sure you don't need anything else, but they're not intrusive. They are staffed well enough so it doesn't take more than a slightly raised finger or nod of the head to bring the waiter to the table. Every time we've been there, the head chef has always made the rounds of the dining room to personally ensure that everyone's meal met to their satisfaction. Instead of cheap Styrofoam, any leftovers are placed in disposable plastic containers and given to you in a nice red Charcoal Room bag.  Just writing this review makes me want to give our host a call to set up reservations for another meal here."}
{"text":"Ok if your in vegas and looking for a quality steak go here. Me and the bachelor party of 15 other guys got reservations here because we didn't want spend $200+ each on a nice dinner on the strip. We were not disappointed. Hands down one of the best meals I have ever had. The server Laura also added to our night. She fit right in with all the boys in our private dinning room. She started the night out with shots for everyone and then she said \"trust her\" I'm glad we listened, cause she kept bring appetizers and oysters, etc. She was spunky and kept firing little one liners to all the guys. She even brought a chocolate milk out to one of the younger guys who was \"acting like a baby\". Honestly it was the perfect dinner for our group. Get the bone in NY and trust Laura ! Oh and Apps, drinks, and steaks for everyone was less than 1900 bucks for 17 guys. That same meal would have been around 4,000 bucks on the strip."}
{"text":"We came on saturday early evening.  We received a $25 coupon for staying at the hotel.  We started with th calimari. The batter was crispy and not to salt but had some great flavor. The sauce was a red sauce which was plain I would have prefered an aioli.  The sour dough bread was fresh and delightful. The rasin bread was amazing. The main course was nothing less than spectacular, the hanger steak was cooked to perfection. We also ordered the scallops they were wonderful.    Our server, Gary, was a master at his craft. He created a excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Impressed with the table setup as well as the customer service. The salad wasn't fresh, but it was edible. The meat was cooked just right. I enjoyed the intimacy and calmness of the restaurant. Easy checkout!!!"}
{"text":"The bartenders were great, the wine by the glass selection was very good and reasonable.  The dining room service was spotty.  I ordered the lobster chowder and the filet sliders w/ creamed spinach.  I had to send back the chowder as it was bland, underseasoned and tasteless.  The sliders were great and cooked to a perfect MR.  The spinach was underseasoned and underwhelming.  My wife ordered the petit filet Oscar style.  It was cooked perfectly, but they forgot the Oscar.  Could it be that hard?"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is terrible. The steak was dry and tough. I asked for a rare and got a medium. The service is a complete joke we had to wait 20 minutes just to get our check."}
{"text":"I can honestly say this was the worst meal Ive ever eaten in Las Vegas! Very over priced, everything is separate!   Well we had company in town they picked going to the Charcoal room ...this was the 7th of October now. We orderd a 32 ounce filet whitch was not even close to that big! a baked potatoe that was cooked sometime a week ago or something and a salad marginal..also orderd a side of asparigas which was very big and tough...I orderd a new york and it was a strip steak  not what I wanted very tough only ate a couple bites and no more the waiter was very slow and we even ran out of water! was never asked if we wanted desert mayb you dont have it?  when you run out of water at a table to me is not good! our company orderd two t bones and a salad and a glass of wine...the whole bill was 195 or something they gave him a 20dollar tip for some reason i dont know why! It was not what I expected from a guormet restaraunt thats for sure!  I didnt complain because we had commpany what good would it have done anyways! nothing is the santa fe is anygood!"}
{"text":"Very poor service .. Everybody was least interested.we went on Halloween night so maybe folks were not in the mood to serve! Starting from the host at the  entrance to the food quality was bad. The food was greasy and awful. Maybe for the ambience I would give this 2 star otherwise its 1 star"}
{"text":"We went to dine on my birthday,... very rude wait staff who do not wash their hands. Food fair but terrible service. we won't dine there again. I suggest you don't either for the sake of your health."}
{"text":"The lobster was huge and delicious...the king crab legs was amazing!!!!  We also tried the lamb chops and new York strip...you can not go wrong....great atmosphere and ambiance.   I love it."}
{"text":"Love this spot! I go here with my dad. We went this past week, usually the food is great, however they gave us the wrong steak and said we ordered the wrong steak (which we didn't because we double checked). It's okay though, the pretzel bread alone will keep us coming back!"}
{"text":"Wowza! We were hosting some friends from Oregon and wanted to go out for a nice dinner on Saturday night. We weren't in the mood for the strip and I had a coupon so we decide to take a chance on the Charcoal Room. The atmosphere was nice and upscale.  When fresh, hot bread was served we though we might be on the right track.  Our server, Misha was very helpful, made some great suggestions and was very attentive and professional.  We were all extremely pleased with our meals.  The French onion soup was the best I've had in years and the Caesar salad was huge enough to split.  Our steaks were cooked to perfection and were incredibly flavorful.  The cilantro sauce was delicious and my friend was extremely pleased with her scallops. Great flavors and large portions at a good price... We couldn't have been happier and will make it a point to return again and again."}
{"text":"Stopped for the sirloin and lobster special.  Waiter told us the steak was not quite up to what they normally serve, he was right; however, the sides and lobster and service were great.  Honest waiter, lived up to expectations."}
{"text":"Awesome service, food and atmosphere!!! The waiter was very friendly, attentive and efficient.. I can't say enough about the food... It was delicious from the bread to the appetizers to the main dish. My party seated promptly, and I loved the wine selection"}
{"text":"Best seafood ever jackpot was the best , very good birthday date in along time..service was awesome, atmosphere ok , but very pleasant"}
{"text":"Food was very delicious. We ordered Rib eye steak with asparagus, atlantic salmon scampi, and iceberg wedges. 3 stars is for the super slow service and we had to requests 3 times to get a simple straw. I do commend the server named Alma for her assistance on her service. She was not our waitress but next time we come back again I will personally request her to be our server."}
{"text":"Beautiful food, excellent value, and the staff is friendly and inviting. Thank you, Laura!"}
{"text":"The best place for a Filet in Las Vegas. We also had the Sea Bass, it was fantastic. The spinach salad and the au gratin potatoes were equally delicious. The service was wonderful, just a few reasons why this place is one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Been here at least twenty other times; this was previously my favorite local steakhouse, even though it is a bit pricy for many locals.  The food, service and ambiance has always been enjoyable.  So for our anniversary last Friday night, my wife and I enjoyed Porterhouse Steak, Broiled Sea Bass, French Onion Soup, Oysters on the Half Shell, and sides of Scallops, Au Gratin Potatoes, Creamed Corn, plus Chocolate Cake for dessert.  What I didn't enjoy was the explosive diarrhea that struck me moments after coming home, and which lasted about 18 hours.  I suspect the Oysters were bad as they were the only item which my wife didn't taste, and she was fine.  The following day, I wanted to warn the restaurant that their Oysters may be spoiled, but no one took my call.  So I left a message for the Food and Beverage Manager, who never bothered to call me back."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, no more Turtle Cheesecake !!! They took it off the menu with the Lemon Cake!! Unreal."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! I was first introduced here by my Mother and Father in law.  I had the filet mignon and it was perfect! It was tender juicy just the way I expected for a perfect steak.  The second time we dined here was with my wife, and the gentleman who was sitting next to us on his way out recommended the rib eye on bone. Let me just say that the rib eye was almost bigger than my head and the flavor with just the perfect spices made every bite salivating for the next one.  This is my first review and I highly recommend The Charcoal Room and when you do.. Ask for the Rib Eye on bone.   I promise you will not regret the choice!  :)"}
{"text":"We dined here for brunch on Easter Sunday and couldn't have been more pleased.  The restaurant was lovely, the food and CHEF were superb and our waiter BILLY, was the best in Vegas.  The selection of foods offered, ranged from wonderfully fresh shell fish and smoked salmon, to custom-built omelets that were on point , to delicious and juicy prime rib, lamb and turkey. The bottomless champagne, mimosas and Bloody Marys, were the icing on the proverbial cake. This restaurant has recently been remodeled and has been transformed into a handsome venue for a steak dinner or any other special meal. The service was top notch, friendly and very professional.  You will want to come back again and again. And all you wine lovers will be in heaven.  The wine library as you enter will take your breath away and soothe your thirst for all things grape!! Again, please keep in mind BILLY for your server.  He made our meal all the more special with his affability, charm, attention to detail, as well as his special attention to all of our needs. Nice private room in the back was perfect for our party of 10! We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Girls night out at the charcoal room ! Wonderful dinner !! Our waitress ,Laura , suggested splitting three ways ...the crab dip , pan seared rib eye, Alaskan king crab legs , and a couple of sides .  Can't say enough about how delicious the meal was for us all ! Great wine and a lovely experience! Highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back !!"}
{"text":"The scallops were fishy and gritty... very disappointed with meal. The lobster tail was not as advertised, less than 6oz cooked, the tail was listed as an 11 oz tail, prepared horrible, overcooked.. Im so disappointed in the seafood,  will think twice about returning"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Vegas!  My filet was cooked and seasoned perfectly and had great Flavor. I ate at the bar and Carrie took wonderful care of me.  She was a real pleasure. Great Job!"}
{"text":"Well, I got no one to blame but Myself. I read the reviews and still went. AAAND, I'm taking time out of My life to write this. The Charcoal Room ain't what it used to be. I took My visiting Family there last night(Tuesday). This was the only resturant I ever ordered the Porterhouse. It used to be incredible, now, it just needs laces. Had a reservation, only one booth open, the first one, the rest were dirty, the hostess told Us. The waiter spoke broken english. OK. The steakhouse chopped salad, was chopped about 3 hours before We got them, light on the dressing, almost like a soup. Not crispy at all, no flavor.. My steak, I ordered medium rare, was medium. Fortunately, My nephew ordered his NY steak medium and it came medium rare, so I ate most of his and took mine home to My pooch, even she was dissappointed. The colossal baked potato was poor quality, soggy skin, hard and cracked inside...old. The Mac and Cheese, those bastards!!! Yep, also made too far ahead. I would say the service was good except for two things. One, Nobody ever asked how things were. Two, when you're a waiter and you're putting a coustomers entire steak(less 2 bites) into a doggie bag, don't you wonder why? The worse thing about the Charcoal Room is...........I ate there when it was incredible. Too bad. I don\"t recommend it to anyone. I won't be going back. Oh, and, adios."}
{"text":"We indulged at \"The Charcoal Room\" for the first time Wednesday evening Dec 1.  Beautiful, Very Clean (wish i woulda thought to take pics), Excellent Wait Staff.  App'd on Seared Ahi Tuna (12.00), Crab Cakes (12.00), for both of the app's, the presentation, quality and taste were worth the trip alone.  Beth had the Lamb Chops (37.00), they make a Guiness Reduction Sauce with them . . Very Good.  I had the Organic Whole Chicken (19.00), baked, seasoned nicely . . Very Good.  Everything was nice sized portions (we took some home), and cooked perfectly/as ordered.  Happy to give them a 5 star review."}
{"text":"If you're getting a steak dinner anywhere else in town, I'm going to consider you crazy. I know this is a $$$ listed place, but you get so much for your money (and wine that's not insanely marked up) - and it's all delicious. And if prime rib is your thing, don't be deterred by the single menu offering, just get it if they have it. Pair it with either the creamy spinach or potatoes au gratin for a match made in heaven. I am seriously in love with this place."}
{"text":"Great service!!  We had a very large party, but they were very accommodating.  The food was excellent.  My husband enjoyed his fillet mignon with the garlic cilantro sauce. My bacon-wrapped bbq shrimp was juicy and enough to fill me up, and that was an appetizer.  I had the melon martini which was fruity and refreshing.  As with one of the other reviewers, they left the strainer as well for more to enjoy.  My friends and I had a great time.  The manager was very hospitable and checked on us often to see if we needed anything else.    Definitely a place we'd visit again on our Vegas trips!!!"}
{"text":"The ahi tuna and the lamp chops I ordered were cooked perfectly. The service was also terrific, and the wine wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"We had the steak and lobster special.  Steak was not prepared medium. as requested.Steak was fine the second time. Lobster was cold  both times. We have been there several times before with no issues.  Manager did remove from bill and admitted the special was not up to par..... Not many people there on a Friday night..??"}
{"text":"Wednesday 7, no problem getting a table, there were 5 of us, steaks were marginal, one had the burger, kind of dry at medium.  For $20 should have had at least some cheese and bacon offered and you couldn't substitute anything, it'll be a long time before I go back here again, if ever."}
{"text":"Just left The Charcoal Room at Santa Fe Station in the Northwest part of Las Vegas.  6:45 dinner reservation for me and my wife. We were seated promptly.  Then we sat for 12 minutes without a soul stopping by to say anything. Finally someone stopped and asked us if we would like some water. My wife tried to order a martini from the bar. \"I can't do that, but I can try and find your server.\"   4 minutes later Patty showed up. We ordered bread (the pretzel bread is pretty good, I admit),  a diet Coke for me and the apple martini for my wife. Since we were concerned we might not see Patty again for a while, we went ahead and ordered appetizers and main courses then as well.  The diet Coke and bread showed up in minutes. The apple martini took 12 MORE minutes. It didn't arrive until seconds before the appetizers arrived. Patty apologized and vowed to find a manger to take some percentage off of our final bill for making us wait so long.  Crab cakes (appetizer) were ok. I'm a crab cake fan and these were no better than what you can buy at a supermarket and bake in your own oven. The crab meat to filler ratios were skewed waaaay too much in the favor of whatever breadcrumb-type filler they use.  The oysters on the half-shell were good - fresh horseradish, fresh cocktail sauce and tabasco. No saltine crackers like in some places but not a biggie. I felt they would've brought us some if we'd asked, but I didn't want to risk waiting 20 minutes for them.  Entrees arrived. I had a full-sized filet mignon and a lobster tail. My wife had pan-seared scallops and we shared some of the lobster mac n cheese.  My steak was a good-sized portion, appeared to be a good cut of meat and was perfectly cooked. Unfortunately it had next to zero flavor. That is NOT necessarily the fault of the restaurant as it appeared they did everything right with this filet. Sometimes you just get one where you did everything right with and it still comes out tasting like grilled water. I'm a steak aficionado and what I've read on this issue in the past suggests that the diet of the cow is the most likely culprit here, but even that is debatable. Suffice to say I don't blame the Charcoal Room for a properly cooked but flavorless steak - I blame the cow!  My wife's scallops tasted ok. On a 1 - 10 scale they'd be about a 6. It's pretty obvious to me that these scallops had been frozen prior to hitting the pan. That's ok if you're going to really take your time to make sure they come out perfect, but it's not okay if you're going to just slap them down for a pre-determined period of time and call it a day. You might get away with that using fresh or thawed scallops, but not frozen.  The sauces for the crab cakes and scallops appeared to be the same sauce and it was completely uninspired. A good crab cake remoulade usually has a \"mustardy\" (if that's a word) quality to it that bites back a bit when you try it. This sauce was mildly buttery but completely devoid of anything resembling a spice or flavor.  My lobster tail was the biggest disappointment. Again, it appears to have been cooked properly, but had a slightly overcooked, rubbery texture. Like the scallops, I would bet anything this is a result of using an improperly thawed lobster tail.  Incidentally, I realize that virtually ALL modern seafood is frozen at some point in its journey to your plate Yes, even the majority of sushi is frozen before you eat it - in fact, it's frozen before it leaves the boat that caught it! Several times I've stood in the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo and watched the flash-frozen blue-fin and yellow-tail tuna hit the docks frozen solid before the morning auctions.  The problem isn't the freezing of seafood for shipping - it's in sloppy thawing (or non-existent thawing) procedures before cooking. That's what I suspect doomed my wife's scallops and my lobster tail.  The mac n cheese with lobster was good but not phenomenal.  We passed on dessert.  That \"discount\" that Patty promised to get us? Never materialized.  We'll not be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here last night during our stay at Palace Station, when we checked in they gave us a $25 off $50 coupon for The Charcoal Room, so we decided to go for dinner. We started off with the sautéed mushrooms, which were amazing, I always order mushrooms and these were up there with any of them. We both ordered filet mignon, I got the 10 oz, which is huge for a filet. She got the petite 7 oz, which is still bigger than alot of places regular filet mignon. It comes with a house salad, which was carefully hand picked, like every piece of lettuce was perfect and mushrooms, sayce of your liking, tomato, and more,  just a perfect house salad for me. The whole time they give you fresh bread, pretzel, which is AMAZING, sourdough, and squaw. So after being careful not to get full and oace myself before my steak came, my steak arrives, and it was a perfect filet mignon. My girlfriend's petite was a perfect medium rare aswell as mine, both had excellent flavor.. I got delicious buttery mashed potatoes, so good didn't have to request gravy or au jus. We also had the sautéed asparagus which is mre her thing, but I tried aswell and I usually don't eat them too much, but these were excellent. shocked about the $$$ Price Tag in the magazine they give you in the hotel. With the $25 off $50 from staying  (with a comp room might I add) I paid $54.08 + tip.That's with 2 side dishes. Don't hesitate to try this place, ESPECIALLY  if you are already at Palace Station. You actually feel transported out of the casino into this restaurant and has it's own very nice atmosphere seperate from the casino just outside the doors."}
{"text":"I was not expecting much from The Charcoal Room, but wow! The atmosphere was great, the wait staff was wonderful and the food was awesome.  I had a moscato that was amazing. We started with the chef special appetizer- crab dip with sourdough bread. The dip was so good! I ordered the filet which was delicious and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend ordered the prime rib which he said was great. We also shared the lobster macaroni and cheese - so good with chunks of lobster in it. We had no room for dessert, but we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Since we had a coupon ($25 for $50 of food) that was set to expire, my husband & I dined here for a belated birthday dinner.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to our expectations.  Service was very slow.  It took over 5 minutes to be greeted by the assistant waiter, than 10 more for our head waiter to take our drunk order.  I had the lemon drop which was pretty good.  The wine recommended to my husband was enjoyable.  I had the onion soup to start and it was nothing special.  I ate maybe a fourth of it.  I ordered the petite filet and my husband the bone-in ribeye.  I chose the mashed potatoes and he chose the lobster mac-n-cheese.  (I don't eat seafood.)  It took a very long time to get our food. The steaks were nothing special.  My mashed potatoes are better.  These were bland.  We skipped dessert and won't be back."}
{"text":"I always come here for the king crab legs! The price is not bad at all for how big the crab legs are and the wonderful customer service they provide. This place is quiet and dark perfect for a romantic dinner. Coming here with friends is also very nice."}
{"text":"I had heard this place had the best steak in town. I was very disappointed with the just about everything. When we were seated our booth was covered in food which my date sat in, the table was dirty and the food was just okay. It was not worth a 200 dollar meal for two, there are far better steakhouses in las vegas for the price. The one thing I can say is our waiter was very nice and kept my drinks filled. I would not recommend this place to anyone, again there is far better in Vegas at a 100 dollars a head."}
{"text":"Usually I don't head up to Santa Fe Station but tonight we were here to see a concert at the Chrome Showroom.  Our guest was craving a steak, I walked in expecting to eat at a little diner somewhere in the casino.  Instead, he chose the Charcoal Room.  First off, I am not used to high-end steakhouse dining.  Ellis Island is my average steak joint of choice.  A la Carte dining is also new to me but not an unwelcome option.    This evening we showed up around 8pm on Saturday and were seated immediately.  The middle of the restaurant has a bar with plasma tvs; this was great for watching the Final Four games while dining.  Service was quick and excellent (helpful because the restaurant was not very full).  The bread options were excellent, from regular rolls to pretzel bread, there was plenty for the entire table.  Salads were optional and while I did not enjoy one, the others at my table were raving over a simple chopped salad.  My roommate and I ordered the 14oz Triple Peppercorn Steak while our guest had the 20oz Bone-In New York Strip.  Our steaks were amazingly soft yet crunchy with the spices making each bite utterly enjoyable.  We added a Lobster Mac & Cheese for a side that we all shared and this was equally as good.  While I could not afford to eat here often, if I wanted to treat a guest to a nice steak dinner with an excellent atmosphere but not stuffy enough you couldn't wear jeans and a t-shirt into the restaurant, this is the place I'd go."}
{"text":"Went there last night.  Saw yelp review.  It was very good.   French onion soup amazing? Prime rib Service  Everything perfect.   Plan on going again."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, service was terrible, as well as the food. Crab legs way overlooked, vegetables cold. People that got seated after us got served before us. Manager was a real witch. Only giving 1?star cause I can't give them zero."}
{"text":"I really don't understand how my experience was so much different than the other reviewers.   Annoying semi-nice steak house with sports on monitors and tables so close together you're pretty much sharing a table with strangers.  Steaks were overcooked, sides were just ok. Service was painfully slow.  I was glad for it to be over.  Cheddar and Black Bean Soup earned this an extra star.  If you're ever going to walk through a casino to get some awesome soup, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The table was too round, couldn't hear anything anyone was saying because they were so far away  The steak (porterhouse) was not cooked correctly, lifeless in flavor and I had to spit out gristle every other bite."}
{"text":"I read a previous review which referred to the charcoal room as a hidden gem, I couldn't agree more. As a local, and someone who works in the business.  I was happy to sit down at the bar, have my bartender Carrie, greet me with a genuine hello. Asked how my day was and if I would be dinning at the bar, or just having a drink. I decided to eat at the bar. I asked her what I should I try. For starters she suggested the pink grapefruit, mind you there is no grapefruit in this amazing cocktail. And oh was it yummy.  From there I knew Carrie, could take me on a \"limo\" ride. So she did, suggesting the I start with shrimp cocktail, and for dinner a must have, king crab. Oh Carrie, you were spot on. The bar was steady, as the restaurant. The manager Diego, stopped by asking how I was enjoying my pink grapefruit, I saw a lot of interaction between Diego, and staff. Made the restaurant feel welcoming. Just a overall great experience.  I have driven 15 min for many of things, and I would drive the 20 it took me tonight again."}
{"text":"First timers and we had a great experience. We're locals as of a few years ago. We've had some great experiences at Steak Houses in town and have begun to discover that the less well known Casinos have some amazing Steak Houses (I.e. Circus Circus, Aliante and now Santa Fe).  Spectacular, aged, prime cuts cooked to perfection.  Service was perfect, attentive but not over done.  We will absolutely make this a regular haunt in the neighborhood.  Finally made it back and every bit as good as the first visit. Steaks were perfectly done, as gratin potatoes were spectacular and you MUST try the off-menu garlic / cilantro sauce ... it was flavorful without being over-powering."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our prime rib. They do serve you a king cut price of meat, but the quality went right out the door. We both ordered prime rib, and both were CHEWY! That's not quality meat they are serving. Service was great, the sauces they offer, fantastic, we had the garlic, cilantro sauce and a Béarnaise sauce. I could eat it with a spoon, it was so good.    I will not be returning, the quality is NOT in the food."}
{"text":"This steak house is a joke.  The food had no flavor.  The service was slow. I ordered some mash potatoes and when they came out they were cold.  I was just looking to get a good steak and this is not the place"}
{"text":"Always good food and great service at an excellent value compared to Flemings or any other high end steak house.."}
{"text":"Wow, our first time here and we had a most enjoyable experience.  Gary, our server was cordial yet welcoming with good suggestions for menu selections.  All of our service was prompt, unobtrusive and friendly.  This was a special occasion dinner with our kids and it lived up to all of our expectations.  Two of us had the pan fired sea bass and it was perfect, in fact some of the best I have had.  A serving size that was larger than normal and cooked to a \"T\",  The prime rib and filet mignon were also prepared to perfection.  The French onion soup, lobster soup and chopped salad were great accompaniments to our meal.  Side dishes are large and can easily be shared with the entire table.  We will definitely return for the food, service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Well ... the Orchid and I had an event to celebrate (and as is my custom, I told no one; I don't do \"happy-happy-joy-joy\" and have been known to walk out of an establishment if they inflict this type of thing on me), and we had always had positive experiences at the Broiler.  I phoned Palace Station, and was informed that the steak house is now the Charcoal Room.  I figured, how much different can it be?  I made rservations.  Come the night in question .. about five days ago.  We walk in on time (7:15 pm), and the place was almost empty.  Always a little scary in a \"first-time\" place.  But, we went in anyway.  Reactions and review follow.  Atmosphere.  Typical \"wanna-be-a-steak-house\" decor ... lots of reds and oranges, subdued lighting, et cetera.  Horseshoe booths.  Two-top and four-top tables.  Pretty standard.  Note that despite being inside a busy casino, we had very little ambient noise during our meal.  We did ask to be placed far from the entrance, specifically for this purpose; how much noise abatement was placement and how much was site design, I can't say.  A nice touch.  Observation: the Broiler had an extensive salad bar, including the largest asparagus spears I have ever seen.  (In the interest of full disclosure, the Great Bearded Bird is a sucker for a good salad bar, and LOVES asparagus.)  No such amenity exists at the Charcoal Room.  Service.  The hostess (I believe her name was Lauren) was pleasant and prompt, and got us to a table before I could stop talking.  Nicely done, my dear.  Waiter (Francisco) introduced himself within three minutes of our being seated, and told us he would be serving us with the aid of another staff member (female; I missed her name, unfortunately).  Beverages were delivered quickly, and by my wife's request, soft drinks were served in the wine glasses (her only concession to the event being celebrated).  Refills of beverage, questions about the menu, suggestions on dishes, and special requests were all handled quickly, pleasantly, and professionaly.  Once again, nicely done.  Food.  It starts getting just a little rocky right about here.  The Orchid passed on an appetizer, and I had half-a-dozen oysters on the half shell, as I hadn't had oysters in several years.  They were served in an aluminum contraption the size of a freight barge full of ice, with red cocktail sauce, grated horseradish and something that looked like a wine-based minionette.  The oysters were good, but the person who shucked them needs some more training; every oyster had relatively large chunks of shell in them.  Not pleasant having to fish them out of your mouth.  (I know this old man needs more minerals in his diet, but seriously ...) I went away from my normal carnivorous tendencies (that being a rib-eye), and tried the King Cut prime rib.  Not bad, and prepared properly (medium rare, delightfully pink), but frankly, I've had better.  I added scallops - another weakness of mine - but to my taste, they were not worth 3-for-$14.00.  Side ordered the asparagus (as noted above), and again it just kinda fell short. Orchid ordered the sea bass at the recommendation of our waiter, and that was spot-on.  I had a taste, and as much as fin-fish normally isn't my go-to, I would order this again for myself in a heartbeat.  Wonderfully flaky, moist and \"ding-ding-ding\" good.  She ordered the creamed spinach - one of her favorite dishes - and picked another winner.  She ordered the sweet potato, and was quite pleased with it.  (I have never been a fan of sweet potatoes; I trust her judgment, as I didn't taste it.)  Dessert time came, and whatever she ordered (I want to say the carrot cake?) she was also quite pleased with.  (The Great Bearded Bird is diabetic, and therefore tries not to even pay attention to the sweets on a menu.)  All in all, I was happy, but the Orchid was thrilled (and isn't that just the way it should be?)  Will I return?  Probably, with a few mental notes about what NOT to order. -- -- -- -- -- On the Nighthawk 100-point scale: 90."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night and I ordered the spinach salad which was excellent and the chicken (which I felt was only average) however my husband ordered the filet mignon and it was honestly the best steak I have ever tasted.   I will definitely go back but next time I'll order the steak.   It is pricey and everything Is a la carte.  But it was nice and I will go again."}
{"text":"1) Very nice atmosphere and decor 2) Reasonable pricing of meals 3) Courteous, competent, friendly server 4) Delicious food - only one mistake, and they made it right with no fuss  Yet another great value at Palace Station.  This place is making an A+ effort to BRING it with their dining offerings.  Which is great for me, since I'm WAY too smart to gamble :)"}
{"text":"To start: if cooked properly the steaks are out of this world.  We had a 5pm reservation. Arrived at 450 and had to wait till 5pm on the dot. Fine since that's when they \"open\". We've been here quite a few times. Every single time my mother in laws filet is undercooked. She requests well done, and while some may not like to cook a steak that temp , this is what she likes. The steak was pink throughout. The other 3 in the party- steak amazing. But poor mil, she sent the steak back asking for a well done filet. The same steak comes back charred on the outside but still slightly pink. For a 34.00 piece of meat it should be cooked right. And it just doesn't seem right to bring the same steak back. Now, the service was slightly odd. The waitress , I can't recall her name but it started with a J , and her help I believe was jordan. Anyway, they weren't rude but just lingered way to much.  We won't go back cause honestly we'd prefer to all eat together ... hers is never right so... pass!"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for her bday dinner. And we loved every single item from start to finish. The menu is simple but has everything you want in a steakhouse. Service was great, everyone was very friendly. We will define come back here again and again! Thank you Charcoal Room for making my girl have a special night with me."}
{"text":"Have a really good ribeye juicy is heck the sides were wonderful specially the potato Grande"}
{"text":"WOW!!! Yes 4 exclamation points!  This place was ruined to me by 1 server and the cook who couldn't follow orders. We ate here with a group of 13 on a Sunday night. Service started off kind of good drink orders taken, wine served ($25 cork fee not bad) , soon after orders taken by two waiters, one for each side of table. They start at end of table, but since the first person on our side was not ready and for some reason our waiter thought no one else was ready, he had announce \"well no one is ready on my side\" ?, when the whole time we were ready and it took us a couple times to get his attention. Order was taken then they brought bread (the bon bread is good).  I ordered the Kitchen Sink Cesar, and fried chicken. (I don't care what people say when they say I should of ordered steak at a steak house, don't serve it if you can't cook it.)  My wife ordered house salad with the sea bass broiled with no salt or pepper. Didn't really pay attention to what everyone else had, but I was told to get the salad .   The kitchen sink salad was really good, that horseradish dressing was tasty. My wife's salad was how she wanted it with no dressing. Then entrees were served I got a  fried boneless chicken breast that they promote as buttermilk fried chicken. (In my mind I'm getting fried chicken) not one big dried SALTY AS CAN BE chicken finger,  that tasted like a salt lick. It was served on top of what seemed liked homemade chips with a side of gravy something, and was one of the saltiest things I have eating since salt. Not to mention they completely over cooked it ,which I didn't because the handful of salt on the chicken was enough to mention.  My wife's fish came out pan seared in butter seasoned with salt and pepper and over cooked .  She ate it anyway because she don't like to say anything.  The waiter seemed apologetic and ask me what else I wanted, I asked for the house salad. That's when service got a little spotty. We had to fill our own wine and the help seemed scarce. Lol ! He brought the salad and when I took a bite I almost spit it out because it had SALT ON IT! Who puts salt on a salad , smokers? I thought I was crazy but then someone else at the table tried it and reassured me the white crystals on my salad was in fact salt. I told the waiter that it had salt on it  and I must of offended him when I asked if this was a joke only because I never seen salt poured onto a salad, especially on a salad for a customer who just sent something back for being to salty. Seems like the joke was on me this night. Again who puts salt on a salad? Then he started arguing with me and basically called me a liar so I swiped my finger on the plate full of salt and said what's this white stuff then. Left him mumbling as he walked away with an attitude and if he was that bitter he should of ask me to step outside. I don't know what happened to the customer is always right when it comes down to what we decided to eat and how we want it. We never saw that waiter the rest of the night. The new one was better anyway.  Manager did offer me something from the menu, but by then I was over it. I did order the Creme brûlée that I wish I didn't because it was bland no vanilla flavor. I had two spoons and stopped  taste like a dirty refrigerator.   NEVER, EVER AGAIN. NEVER  I give it down!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's my go to place and i don't have to go to the strip for fine dining. It's Definitely a gem. I highly recommend the cappuccino if you're a coffee drinker."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for dinner. The bartender, Yanya, was very nice & provided excellent service. Started with shrimp cocktail. There were 4 huge shrimp for $12... Very good. I had the pan seared scallops. They  were nice & big.....cooked to perfection. I loved every bite. My husband had the 10oz filet mignon & tater tots. He thought the filet was  good, cooked exactly how he asked, and you can't go wrong with the price $34. The tater tots were also good. Handmade....not  some typical frozen things. Would defiantly go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite of mine that I always come to when I visit Vegas. I always get a salad and the seafood jackpot. The dining area is also very elegant yet casual. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"What a disappointing dinner.  There was absolutely no attempt to treat us like valued guests.   I was celebrating a birthday and no one asked if we were celebrating a special event.   I asked specifically for my dressing for the salad to be on the side but it was poured over the salad.  Yes I could have sent it back but simply not worth the trouble.  The manager walked by our table several times and was standing at the podium when we left but never bothered to ask how dinner was.  For these prices we expect better quality of service."}
{"text":"Happily surprised and satisfied by the meal here. My parents were locals and had vouchers and reward points to use here. Even though the casino itself may be dated, the Charcoal Room was one of the best dining experiences I had in Las Vegas and highlights the fact that the best food is found off the Strip.  All four of us had various cuts of steak, all with different seasoning and taste. If you like thicker cuts, try the porterhouse or the succulent prime rib - the prime rib especially with the cilantro sauce was out of this world. I had the petit filet mignon and added some scallops on the side - the menu no longer had the surf and turf combo others mentioned, but they still allow you to add on smaller portions of seafood to an existing entrée. No complaints about the scallops - cooked to perfection but just wished I got a larger portion for the price. The petit filet was wonderful.  Vegetarian sides were also a la carte and didn't come with steak meals.  The service was warm and polite and the restaurant itself was classy. I could easily see myself having a business lunch/dinner here with no concerns.  This will be one of my regular places to go to when I go back to LV."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, the food was good, but overall it was a little expensive for what you get.  Food. 3.5  service 4, Ambience 3, overall 3.5."}
{"text":"Absolute BEST steakhouse in North Las Vegas.  Great atmosphere, wonderful service and worth every dollar."}
{"text":"I have heard good things about this place and we finally had a chance to try it for dinner. Nice atmosphere tucked away from the hustle of the casino. Our server Patsy was excellent. She was attentive without being overbearing.  The meal started with a bread basket. It was fresh and so delicious. The pretzel bread was one of the best I have tasted in awhile. They also served a raisin nut bread and sourdough. Both were so tasty.  I had the seared ahi tuna appetizer. The sauce it came with was excellent. Great dish. I had the petite filet and sea scallops for my entree. The steak was so tender and cooked exactly to the temperature I ordered. I chose the garlic cilantro sauce and it was fabulous. The scallops were average meaning they were good but nothing special that I have not experienced elsewhere. We really enjoyed our meal here and will definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"Pretty dam good. I ordered the ribeye with the mashed potatoes as it came along with a salad . Can't beat the price for what it was priced @.They also have a happy hour menu from 4:30 - 6:30  on their appetizer menu"}
{"text":"I overheard some people talking about the steak house at palace station,I remember thinking palace station? My husband and I decided to go anyways. After pulling into the parking lot and seeing the surroundings we started to have second thoughts.  We decided to go in, the casino was smoky and is in need of a up-dew. After arriving we saw the beautiful wine room,and thought the windows surrounding the restaurant was a nice touch. Greeted with a smile.  Our server was enthusiastic about the crab cakes and spinach salad, we got both. For dinner we ordered the prime NY, I must say this was my first prime steak and boy,am I spoiled. The flavor and texture was amazing. Also ordered the salmon with cream corn. My husband and I were so glad to not have turned that car around. No room for desert but ordered a hot tea, and when I thought I couldn't get more impressed, the presentation of the tea. All I can say is palace station, clean it up, add a movie theater and watch this place turn into a destination for many."}
{"text":"Our party of three visited Sunday night. We waited over an hour for a table, which was fine as we didn't have a reservation.  Everything that came out of the kitchen was fantastic, the steaks, salad, side dishes were all great. The kitchen deserves five stars as they're doing their part really well. It's in the service that this place fails. It started out fine, with our waitress and her assistant paying attention but not hovering, yet it would be nice if the waitress could have cracked a smile at some point.  After our food was delivered, things fell apart fast. The manager came by to ask how we were right when we started eating, and we said \"great\", because the food is excellent. But then our glasses emptied and we began looking around for our waitress, who we hadn't seen in awhile as our food was delivered by someone else. Another waitress kept going by our table and we watched her, but she refused to make eye contact.Is it too hard to fill some glasses? The assistant was missing too, so rather than spending our meal craning around, I grabbed my companion's empty glass and went to the bar, standing to the left of the bartender who was using the computer screen. I waited, and she actually ignored me. Then the assistant eventually re-appeared and took my glass, but I stood there in the middle of the dining room for a few minutes being ignored. After we finished, we sat there waiting to ask for a box, but again, no waitress. We waited and watched, then  eventually the assistant came over because we were just sitting there looking around. We had seen a dessert cart on the other side of the dining room and wanted to order two desserts, but by the time our waitress finally made her way back to us, she had our bill in her hand and wouldn't look at us. She asked if we wanted dessert, but it was with the bill sitting there in her hand, so we just said no so we could go.Then the assistant came to take our plates away and knocked a wine glass onto the floor at our feet, where it shattered. The Charcoal Room has other locations, and the food is excellent, so we'll try elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"it was a great dinner time in this amazing Charcoal Room Steak House with a very good Steak. thank you very much."}
{"text":"We went to the location inside of Santa Fe Station for dinner on 7/4/17. The food was excellent , but what really made the night was our waiter, Kevin! Kevin is old school Vegas and is so entertaining while also giving 5 star service. Thanks to Kevin and Charcoal Room for an excellent evening out to celebrate a birthday!"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is incredible. We are locals and FINALLY made a date night to eat here. Our server was Ralph and Phillip kept our drinks filled and brought out bread, butter, etc. Both of these guys did a fantastic job! Now, about the food-probably the best filet mignon I have ever had and the lobster tail was equally as tasty, My wife had the sea bass which I had a taste of bc I had never had tasted it before-DELICIOUS!!! We intended to post pics but when we saw the food, we dove right in and the pic idea was totally forgotten. Obviously, we highly recommend this place. I am planning on going back later this month. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Arrived as a single about 6:30pm. First observation was grown up music; I.e. Sinatra,  Holliday,  and the like and the noise level a little high. Wine by the glass a little limited and beginnings beginning service a little slow , but breads and salad soon revealed some real quality (fresh water cress, for example). My server Doug exhibited professionalism as he brought out  the small filet and baked potato. Give this a try if you're not hooked on going to the Strip."}
{"text":"Horrible. Maybe because it was Mother's Day. But everything was wrong: Service, food, even drinks. Maybe I need to pick another day to try it again."}
{"text":"This little gem has amazing quality food . Big lobster bisque soup  Amazing filets Quality bearnaise sauce. Delicious (full serving enough for two people) sides   I miss the all you can eat salad bar they had before . I used to come here all the time for it.   I still Come for the steaks . The service is great . Food is impeccable . Prices are decent and very fair for the quality your getting  . They cost less then all 5 star quality restaurants with the same 5 star quality .  I go often. My last waiter there was billy he was awesome . He got us an extra shot of don Julio premium on the house.  His bday was same day as my dates . And he was just literally awesome friendly great server.  We almost gambled with him after but we already had plans. Amazing time can't wait to go back ."}
{"text":"When you come to the Santa Fe station, you expect cheap, discounted, so so food.  Well the Charcoal room is far from that.    The moniker \"you get what you pay for\" works here.  Everything is al a carte .  I enjoyed all that I ordered.  I had Lobster(11oz), side of sauteed mushrooms & ceaser salad.  All was made excellently.  My wife had the petite fillet, extremely tender & flavorful.  I believe you will enjoy your visit as well..."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great quality steakhouse hidden inside of Palace Station. Bar area and ample booth seating, never too busy, simple but well-executed menu. Service varies from efficient to effusive.   The Seafood Jackpot is an amazing and indulgent way to start a group meal here, but the staple apps are the scallops, French onion soup (so hearty!), and the steakhouse chopped salad (huge portion, too).  The pan-seared scallops, if not chosen as an app, are also a great entrée. The King cut prime rib is exactly what it should be, the Colorado lamb chops are delicate but hearty with a perfect merlot reduction.  Sides are mostly potato-based, but solid. Desserts vary but are all typically well-executed. Only bummed that they no longer seem to have the beef tartare on the menu- perhaps it is now only offered as a special?  Despite the great quality and upscale decor, pricing is reasonable and it's intimate enough for a great date night or celebration. Large back room available by reservation for large parties."}
{"text":"Came here to eat a romantic dinner with hubby and daughter. Spending some of our winnings here. We have a $20 voucher if you purchase over $50 in food. We easily did that.   We waited 10 minutes outside the restaurant before it opened at 5 pm for dinner. Our reservations were for 5 pm. We were seated at a booth near the bar.   As soon as we sat, we were given different kinds of bread such as sourdough, raisin and pretzel bread. The nice waitress also got our drink orders. I got an iced tea. For my entree, I got lobster tail. It came with a salad and broccoli. I got ranch dressing on my salad. Salad was ok. After the salad, my lobster tail came with the broccoli on the side. The lobster was cooked perfectly. The waiter gave me some melted butter to dunk my lobster in. So yummy! The broccoli was prepared in some garlic. I can taste it in the broccoli.   Service was excellent by the waitress and waiters. The one waiter gave us extra pretzel breads to go when he packed up our food for us. So kind. We were treated like royalty. LOL! I would definitely come back here if I wanted to eat fancy. I wore the black dress and heels to this place while my daughter wore her Elsa princess dress and hubby in a collared black shirt. You must dress up in this restaurant. So fancy, dark and romantic atmosphere. It is located inside the Palace Station. I definitely recommend this place for date night or special occasion."}
{"text":"Great food and great service... will definitely go back again and will recommend all my friends and family to this place  thank you ray for a great evening  everything was so delicious"}
{"text":"This is actually a regular favorite of ours, the service is always good. The quality is great, and the value is also very good. We can come here on a regular basis and we are always not disappointed. They are not trying to reinvent anything there and nothing is over the top, but if you looking for things cooked properly and something familiar and well executed, this would be it."}
{"text":"Had some free time with the GF and we decided to check out the Charcoal Room at the Santa Fe.  Reservations were made with ease compliments of the yelp website for an early dinner.  We arrived and valeted on the south side.  This made for an easy walk to venue.  The hostess was pleasant and we got to choose between a table or booth.  I like booth when I am with my lady.  Sadly, when we sat down, the angles were all off. the table only moves forwards and backwards.  As a result of my current girth, I was pinned in.  We quickly chose a table.  The service was friendly and attentive.  We bused out with a coupon we had received in the mail.  They advised to give it to them in the end.  The GF started with wine and I started with a martini.  They shake it elsewhere and bring the shaker to the table.  After pouring there was enough left over to replace the half I had already sipped.  Foe an appetizer we decided to split a heirloom tomato salad with mozzarella.  It was a tasty way to start the meal along with the delicious bread.  Some how we had some self control and left room for the meal.  The GF ordered the scallops.  Pan seared or broiled....I can't remember.  They were a welcome addition to my beef to come.  Clean and not sandy.  I ordered up a Fillet Mignon.  Unknown how many ounces it was but is was not a petit for sure.  Medium rare was the call.  I believe it arrived on the verge of rare.  I did not care, my concern was with the GF.  No worries because she ate the half I gave her.  There was a nice cilantro & garlic sauce which accompanied the meal.  Our sides included lobster mac-in-cheese and a truly loaded backed Idaho potato.  First the lobster mac...It was cheesy delicious with a cork screw pasta (if memory serves) the not small pieces of lobsters and crunchy breading were tasty.  The potato was last as well.  I was asked if I wanted the cheese melted and I absolutely agreed.  It came with butter, sour cream, bacon, chives.  This was added to the potato and severed along with the remainder of the meal.  For desert the GF and shared a very berry crisp with a healthy serving of vanilla gelato placed on top.  All in all a pleasant meal decided upon in quick fashion.  Everything came in under a hundo with the coupon.  Not that fancy, as I wore jeans and a collared button up.  But the taste was fancy and affordable.  I look forward to trying again!"}
{"text":"Good stuff; I wouldn't expect a good steakhouse inside Palace Station, but we heard about this place and it was good! We had a 6pm reservation and got there early. The place was surprisingly empty (maybe 10 people in a place that could hold 50 easily), so we were seated where we wanted as soon as we arrived.  Our waiter Billy was good (wine knowledge was a little shaky, but...), and his \"assistant,\" Harrison was on it. I was glad I had some knowledge of wine and picked a great one for a reasonable price. Our water was always filled, our appetizer and entrees came out on schedule, and everyone was friendly.   My g/f got scallops ($19 for 6 big ones!!), and I had a killer porterhouse. The lobster tail was expensive but tasty...just not $30 extra worth of tasty. We got good sides for decent prices - sweet potato, baked potato, sauteed mushrooms - all $6 ea.  We were too full for dessert but it was a good meal. With tip though... $220 for two."}
{"text":"The Charcoal Room is like old Vegas: Sinatra and other classic crooners softly singing standards, excellent meat and potatoes, vibrant yet tasteful decor, and lights just bright enough to see your food yet low enough to be romantic. We had a super time there a couple of Sundays ago, when ace waiter Timothy served us with enthusiastic efficiency. I had the skirt steak, though there are more swish versions of beef on the menu; as guests of our fine host my husband and I both chose that modestly-priced dish. I was advised by Timothy that my steak may get tough if well-done and charred, but I said \"not to worry\". When it arrived, rare in the middle, I sent the meat back to be thoroughly cooked. It came back perfectly broiled and tender as could be; the skirt steak entrée was a large portion compared to other steakhouse fare these days, beautifully presented on the plate. I chose the optional peppercorn sauce, which was a very tasty \"au jus\"-style liquid in a separate little pitcher--there are other traditional sauces available as well. Our baked potatoes were huge and laden generously with butter and sour cream. Now, that's another great vintage Vegas touch."}
{"text":"I give charcoal room five stars because they came through in a big way!! It was the night before my mom had to leave to go back over seas and she wanted steak! So I said what about the charcoal room?  She agreed and we headed on over. The entrance was nice and they have a wall of wine as you walk in and also have another wall of wine towards the back area. The hostess was polite and we were escorted ton our tables promptly. Our waiter was nice and he handled everything great. As we look over the menu we come to two choices the new york or top sirloin usda steaks aged for 28 days. Everything on the menu is a la carte and at $35-$45 for just a steak was a steep price. So we ordered oysters on the half shell,  coconut shrimp, asparagus,  baked sweet potato,  lobster mac n cheese, my mom had the usda new york steak and my lady and I both had the usda top sirloin.  Lets start with the appetizers.  The coconut shrimp was very tasty my inly complaint is that there is only three lol! The oysters were surprisingly great! Briney, with tobasco, horseradish,  and cocktail sauce was great! Now in the main event. The sides were great baked sweet potato was cooked perfectly amd accompanied with a cinnamon sugar butter, the asparagus was cooked theough and had a great taste, the lobster mac n cheese was awesome!! Tender lobster atop a bed of mac n cheese!! The steaks were out of this world. They were so tender, it was steaks that literally melted in your mouth and the taste was amazing. The seasoning tasted like a simple salt and pepper but it was a very good  blend and had a great balance! We had sauces to compliment our steaks (not that the steaks needed them) but we had garlic cilantro,  bernaise, merlot, and  bleu cheese sauces. All were great but we liked the garlic cilantro one the most. We then topped it off with dessert, new york cheese cake and creme brule. The crem brule was great custard had a nice texture and the caramelized top was done to perfection!! My moms cheesecake was to die for, it tasted unlike any cheesecake I had before and that was a good thing. You could actually taste the cheeses and it was awesome! So all in all this was a great experience and I will be back for sure. It was great to have such a great meal to share with my mom before she went overseas. Untill next time charcoal room have a great one!"}
{"text":"Great food with fantastic ambiance!  I enjoyed the sea bass while my friend enjoyed the filet mignon.   Both were cooked to perfection!  Even our sides of spinach, brocollini and the sauted mushrooms were as tasty as can be.  It is no inexpensive, however, given the quality of food, ambiance and over part service provided by Ralph, his assistant Ray, and the manager Eric, the total was well worth the experience.   Thank you Charcoal Room, we will be back."}
{"text":"We have been here many times and every time the food has been consistent! Steaks are always cooked to perfection!! Wish our server this visit had more of a personality. Her service was fine, but that's it...just fine. She was very dry and really didn't seem to enjoy her job all that much. However, her assistant Ray was excellent!!! Great personality and great energy!! Manager stopped by to introduce himself which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the area and we got some promo in the mail for this place so thought we would check it out. I have to say, I don't understand all the rave reviews. The hostess was barely nice - didn't seem to care. The waitress kept looking away while we were talking to her and having conversations with guests at other tables while we were ordering. Don't get me wrong, she was nice, just not as professional as I would expect at a place in this price range - really ruins the experience. For example, my husband ordered the porterhouse with a lobster tail and she forgot the lobster, so after his steak arrived, he had to wait 10 more minutes for his lobster. I think she wasn't really paying attention when we were ordering. On the plus side, they were really fast with the food.   The pretzel bread is great and I definitely recommend the lobster rolls for an appetizer.   I ordered the surf n turf. The lobster tail was huge which was great, but didn't taste very good - and I love lobster. The filet mignon was just okay and honestly I've had better at Outback Steakhouse for half the price.   My husband thought his steak was good, but not great. And for some reason his lobster tail tasted much better than mine. Though still not awesome.   The whole menu is al la carte so every side is an additional $6. I paid $60 for a tiny mediocre filet and one lobster tail and I can't even get some steamed broccoli with it?   Anyway, we will definitely not be back. Not worth the money by a long shot."}
{"text":"Spot on. For a Monday evening we couldn't have possibly asked for a better dinner. Among the two of us we had the spinach salad, Caesar salad, fillet mignon and bone in rib eye. Everything was cooked as ordered and the meal was on time. The price point of the restaurant is really the best part. I've experienced meals just as good as this for 1.5 or even twice as much money downtown or on the strip in Las Vegas. Our only regret is that we didn't have room for desert. Do yourself a favor and order the maker's mark old fashioned before the meal. Cheers Charcoal Room!"}
{"text":"Pros: Filet is buttery soft and delicious. Pretzel bread served hot and oh so good. Lobster bisque is perfectly made. Cons: Do not sit in Diane's station, she has no pulse. Restaurant is too smokey, need to improve air filtration system. Cocktails are too pricey. Questionable neighborhood, valet park."}
{"text":"I hate writing these kinds of reviews. I understand how difficult it is to be a waitress. I always am polite and say please, thank you. I don't believe my friend or I to be difficult to please.  My friend and I had ate at this restaurant last October. We didn't remember the food, but we remembered the good service. This time it was the opposite.   Laura didn't seem to be happy to be at work. The only time I saw her smile was when she over compensated because another table that accidentally was served my lobster chowder.   My friend and I wanted a leisurely experience, but not sure what we would like to have for dinner. After having bread, shrimp cocktail, lobster chowder, 2 glasses of reisling, 1 glass of vo and 7. But after the food being delicious and filling, Laura's bad attitude and sour service; we decided we were finished for the evening.   Everyone else that was working were helpful and happy. We enjoyed our food and beverages, liked the background music and comfortable booths.   We all have our \"off days\". Hopefully it was a rare Laura's \"off night\"."}
{"text":"The food was really good I had filet Mignon and ribeye the only thing that bad bugged me was that after I ordered the waitress said veggies or baked potato? And I got baked potato not knowing it wasnt a side coming to find out i paid 24 for 2 potatoes. If I knew it wasnt a side I would have got a real side with lots of flavor or a starter,  so that kind of killed my mood. But other than that I like the music, atmosphere, and steak"}
{"text":"We were seated at the exact time of our reservation. We were waited upon hand and foot. All left overs were put away. Food impeccable and tasty. So many flavors. Lighting and seating tasteful. Highly recommend and price range was perfect!"}
{"text":"Our waiter, Gary was very attentive. Service was great. The manager came by to introduce himself.   The food came out in a timely manner.   My husband likes the raisin bread. He got the prime rib, medium. (It was a bit more done than he'd prefer) Fries were salty.   I got the seafood jackpot. I enjoyed the lobster. The rest of the seafood was just ok."}
{"text":"Great food, we had the surf and turf special (filet, lobster and shrimp with mashed potatoes and asparagus).  Everything was delicious.  Unpretentious but elegant atmosphere and great service.  Was not very crowded for a Saturday night, but it was the day before Mother's Day, maybe that's why.  I am not sure that such a high end restaurant is going to be able to last at Palace Station due to the sketchy clientele in the casino and surrounding area. However, we enjoyed this restaurant very much!"}
{"text":"We went to the Charcoal Room last weekend for dinner.   Our evening started with lackluster bar service. I suppose I expected a higher quality of bar service for what we were about to pay for dinner and not a woman with the sniffles, inappropriate tattoos for a steak house environment and a bad attitude.   We were able to place our order with the waitress within 5 minutes of being seated. About 10 minutes later our food was brought out to us. This surprised me since our steaks were ordered medium well and well done but the presentation of our dinner was beautiful.   Steak is a strange creature. So many people like it prepared so many different ways. What one sees as medium well another sees as rare, what one sees at medium another seems as well done. The chefs at the Charcoal Room must have 20/20 vision as they did an amazing job with our steaks and they were delicious.   The plan was to stay and have two glasses of wine with a decadent dessert but that plan was thwarted by the earlier experience with the bartender. Maybe I should thank her. Due to her attitude we saved an extra $30 on the bill and had desert at home in bed."}
{"text":"I'm a bigger fan of the location at Palace Station- this one has similar dishes, but they're not as well executed. Came here with a large group for a birthday reservation, and service was very polite but spotty- timing of dishes was off and a couple of orders were mixed up.  I opted for the seared ahi app and the heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad. The ahi was a generous portion for $10, perfectly seared, and I enjoyed the tamari soy sauce but did not care at all for the wasabi cream. The salad was a disappointing mess of underripe tomatoes and flavorless \"mozzarella\"- it didn't even seem to be that cheese, the texture was crumbly and it was dry and flavorless rather than soft and mild.   This location does not have a private room, but they were able to place us toward the back for some privacy. We were informed from the start that they were unable to do separate checks, which was a bit frustrating and led to several of our party using the $4/fee ATM outside. However, we were given a $40 discount card after being seated, which offset that inconvenience."}
{"text":"We went there Sat. night, got seated right away. Took 20 minutes for our waiter, Ralph to acknowledge us. Finally took our order with total attitude. He brought our salads out on a tray, left it there for 15 minutes..right next to our table while he had a joyous conversation in SPANISH at the table next to us. When he decides to give us our salads he just threw them down. Another waiter brought our dinner, he never came back till we were done, I ordered dessert and coffee, my lemon cake was frozen, and never saw the coffee!!! My husband tried getting the manager, but she had a big ol attitude just like the waiter and never spoke to us, she just rolled her eyes! First and last time we ever step foot in there. Not a way to treat your VIP players. Back to red rock we go. P.S. the prime rib was 75% fat, we gave it to the dogs..total waste of $85.00."}
{"text":"My steak came out fine, but my companions ordered them medium rare. The first one came out well done and the second one was almost raw. The food was OK (the salad and sides were good, but the steak was pretty average, and at that price mediocre is not acceptable). Service was slow but tolerable. I might come back, but there are certainly better options out there."}
{"text":"we can't say enough about the charcoal room as we live only 5 miles from there. the staff are great and the food is superb. we like the prime rib and rib eye. along with the side you have enough for the next day. managers are always there and are real friendly. love the place. keep up the good service."}
{"text":"This is more than likely my new favorite steak house. The service was GREAT, the food was tasty, and the atmosphere was on point. The prices are good as well. We were a party of 20 plus, and our servers Timothy, and forgive me I can't recall the other server ( each served their side of the table ) they were proactive, no need to ask they knew what was needed and had it for us. But what really impressed me was the service they provided my 6 year old cousins. They had their own table and they treated those boys with respect, and taught dining etiquette at the same time. I give them 5 stars for all around GREAT SERVICE, from the moment you step through the front door. Presentation was great, I ordered the surf/turf  6 oz steak and 6 0z lobster tail,  mashed potatoes, grilled shrimp, and asparagus."}
{"text":"Has an excellent diiner Saturday night. Reservations made- booth requested.. hostesses very pleasant- Kevin, our waiter was very attentive. Miguel, buser- refilled drinks, brought bread-  terrific wait staff. Alam stopped by to wish us a Happy Anniversary. I had the King cut prime rib- cooked to perfection- my husband had the Colorado lamb chops with merlot reduction. And definitely try the pretzel rolls!"}
{"text":"The service was phenomenal!!  We had an assistant server who served us our drinks and they left us our martini shaker with our glass and they were not reluctant to hold back on the alcohol :)   Great advice as to what kind of steak to get because the Porterhouse was juicy, well cooked (way to go chef) and enough for two people!!  A side of the mashed potatoes was like getting some homemade from my mom's thanksgiving table they were so creamy and savory mmmm.  We also had the Australian named burger (something with a \"W\") and that was sooo goood tooo!   Granted we were hungry but this place did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Place is great! Wonderful service from Corina at the bar. Sat down ordered some happy hour cocktails and food items. Service staff was friendly and prompt. Super pleased with our service today. Only thing I'd recommend is the short ribs from happy hour menu were really tough and hard to chew. Other than that wine was great and wonderfully priced. Thanks for the great service Corina, we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This was the third time dining at The Charcoal Room and the food and service continue to surpass expectations.  Tonight's dinner was in company with friends who had not been to The Charcoal Room before.  Our server Laura, was an excellent hostess and walked everyone through the specials and house favorites.   The meal was well paced and someone was always near by to check that drinks were full.  I tried the French Onion Soup tonight as a starter course and was pleasantly delighted with the richness of flavors and the portion size.  Dinner was a Petite Filet which was cooked exactly as ordered and several sides which the table shared.  Try the Tater Tots, they aren't just for kids as we found out they are freshly made and delicious."}
{"text":"Up until my last visit the Prime Steak at the Charcoal Grill Room was excellent. At my last visit the Prime New York cut was the worst Prime I have ever tasted. It was poorly cooked and extremely tough. The host there brought out a second steak that was also tough.  However, they did not charge me for the steak. Hard to believe the steak was Prime....."}
{"text":"I came on a Friday evening with my family on our journey to try different resturants in Las Vegas. The hostess at the front was really nice and helpful. Most of the staff were extremely attentive. The chef came from the back to ask me about the Aoili sauce I wanted for my calimari and I was really impressed. Our waitress was just ok as she took awhile to bring our drinks and forgot some of our requests for sauces, butter, sour cream. The reason for my disappointment mainly comes because I ordered the most expensive steak which is their bone in Rib Eye steak which was about $40 which would have been fine but it was over cooked. I asked for medium well and got well done. My boyfriend who ordered the Sirloin steak well done  and received a medium/medium-well steak so we had to wait for my both steaks to be re-done while my sister and husband enjoyed their meals. I am sorry to say I was looking forward to a much better steak. I recently had RibEye steak at SW Steakhouse at the Wynn and it was absolute perfection. However, my experience with my RibEye at the Charcoal grill left me very disappointed with the lack of flavor and carmalization. The manager came out to ask why we returned the steaks but never offered any type of compensation for messing up 2 of the steaks ordered. The steaks were re-made and were correct. Unfortunately, I dont see myself coming again and cannot honestly say I would recommend them as a great steakhouse."}
{"text":"Superb Restaurant, excellent food, professional staff.  Very good menu, reasonable prices, high quality steaks, nice atmosphere.  Can't wait for our next trip so we can go back to the Charcoal Room.  The bone-in Ribeye is wonderful."}
{"text":"Who knew ?  This place is amazing and serves wonderful portions !  Go for the Surf and Turf.  Never stayed here before and was so pleased to find a restaurant so good! I thought I all ready had a favorite steak house in Vegas. Obviously now there is some competition !  The wine list was quite impressive as well. See you soon !"}
{"text":"We had a \"my Vegas\" voucher for $30 at this restaurant, so we decided to give it a try. Santa Fe station isn't too far from us, and we'd rather go here than the Strip or Fremont....if the food is good! It WAS. Not only that, but we liked the elegant but relaxed ambiance of the Charcoal Room. Our server was competent (thanks for the recommendation to try the garlic-cilantro sauce on our steaks!), and the \"busboy\" (the guy who took our plates, filled our glasses, and packed up our copious leftovers) was really pleasant and on the ball.  We had filet mignon, the fresh corn, mac-n-cheese, lobster chowder, and cheesecake. Oh, and the complimentary bread...hot out of the oven...yum! The steaks were cooked perfectly, and were piping hot. The sides were both amazing; the mac-n-cheese tasted like my homemade (I use the best cheese in mine), and the s.o. loved his chowder. My cheesecake slice was enormous, and the texture was sooooo smooth. ALL of the portions were huge...I ended up having most of the cheesecake for breakfast the next day; and we had a 2nd steak dinner the next night, with our leftovers :-) The price is well under that of most Strip steakhouses or gourmet rooms. They had a decent selection of beers, wines, after-dinner ports (etc.) too. I would highly recommend this as a place to take guests, have birthdays, etc. It sure made our plain old Sunday really special! I can't wait to go back and try their ginormous lobster tails..."}
{"text":"The hostess was not friendly and ruined my evening. The food runner was nowhere to be found, when I wanted a refill of the bread. My water was not refilled. The chicken marsala was excellent. Not a good value for the money."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  This hidden gem is located inside the Palace Station casino. I previously visited the steakhouse a few times before the re-model when it was called \"The Broiler.\" I didn't really classify it as a steakhouse before, but it was definitely in my top ten Las Vegas restaurants of all time. Based on past positive only experiences, I chose this place to celebrate my recent birthday.  I was skeptic when I first walked in as it now had all the fancy shenanigans of a typical Strip steakhouse, and the hostess was meh (before it was in a casual setting with family-friendly service, along with a free salad bar). Our party of four was seated only to find out that two napkins were missing well into our dinner (had to eventually ask for them as the staff never noticed).  Things turned around though, and the entire staff's service ended up being top-notch. Food was brought out in a timely manner, and drinks were never empty. The Porterhouse was superb for $36 (medium rare with amazing peppercorn steak sauce). The lobster chowder was delicious and massive (I wasn't aware of the large quantity, and our server politely asked if we'd like to separate the portion into two separate bowls). Not bad at all for $10. The chowder and bread alone could be a meal in itself. The pan-seared Sea Bass was excellent as well, along with the asparagus and fries.  A somewhat upscale environment while still retaining local prices and above-average friendly service is an awesome combination. I'd rank The Charcoal Room #3 overall on my list of American steakhouses in Las Vegas. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"It IS in the Sante Fe Hotel, however, it feels like you're in a sexy restaurant on the strip.  The atmosphere is perfect for those with a sophisticated palate, but lacks the loud music, and obnoxious attitudes... If I lived in North Las Vegas, I would love having this place close by without having to drive into town.  Now onto the drinks.  Pretty great wine list with everything from Stags Leap to Cakebread at prices you would expect to pay at a steak house. Had martini's at a prior visit that were excellent.  LOVE the lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and filet mignon.  The 12 oz was enough to split with a girlfriend!  You can make it work on $50-$75 per person plus tip depending on how hungry you are."}
{"text":"This place has always been a favorite of mine for steak.. I don't think I have ever sent food back.. Kevin, one of the servers has been there for years and always makes the evening satisfying. I don't get there often enough.. but filet is killer. Try them on holidays.. they will run bacon wrapped filet specials and it is one of the best things I have ever had.. Wish they would put that on the menu or make it available off-menu to locals."}
{"text":"I'm always excited to try a new steakhouse, but the Charcoal Room inside of Santa Fe Station unfortunately did not live up to my expectations.  The decor was lovely, all red and dark wood with lots of cozy circular booths. They had a singer in the front performing a variety of songs with a guitar. Service was pretty good, no major complaints there. Pricing looked very fair, especially given we were pretty far off of the Strip.  So, what made the Charcoal Room less than stellar? What should have been the star of the show- the steak. I'll get to that shortly.   First, the good stuff. My crab cake appetizer was pretty tasty and a good portion. The crab wasn't lump crab meat and tasted like it was deep fried, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The creamed spinach was perfect- tasty, creamy, and seasoned well. The mashed potatoes and sautéed mushrooms were also very good.  But the steak. Before I ordered, I asked our server the difference between their medium rare and the medium, because I know that some chefs prepare their steaks differently. He told me that medium rare would be pretty bloody, while medium would have a warm pink center. So I went with medium.  Sigh. It was barely pink and extremely tough. I was disappointed. The flavor was good, but I was filled with regret for not going with medium rare.  I thought dessert would help things, but it didn't. The carrot cake was store bought, and not only did it taste that way, the paper between layers was still in the cake- I got a mouthful of it on my first bite, before I saw it and pulled it out. Not good.  The sides, decor, and service are what pulled this to a 3 star review. Everything else- meh."}
{"text":"I had my annual birthday dinner here recently. It was my first time here. Billy was our server and he was really friendly and funny. I got French onion soup for an appetizer and it was amazing. What was even more amazing was my entree, a petit filet Oscar style with crabmeat, bearnaise, and asparagus. I also got a side of mac n cheese. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. They charred the outside of my steak just a touch with that signature charcoal flavor, and it was pure heaven. To top it all off, Billy brought me a slice of carrot cake with a candle in it on the house for my birthday! Overall this was an excellent experience and dinner and I highly recommend this place. I look forward to returning. I also like the fact that it is off the Strip and not packed. It is very low key with an intimate, elegant setting and the prices are quite reasonable for Vegas. Tell Billy I sent you!"}
{"text":"i find it so difficult to read bad reviews of places that i personally love. it's as if i'm somehow getting lucky while everyone else is striking out. that sux!!!  the charcoal room is definitely one of those places that i wish all of you who had bad experiences there had dined with me instead. the outcome would've been quite different, i think.  we've eaten here 3 times and, each time, we've had nothing short of a positive, satisfying experience. i always order a fish of some sort and have never had any complaints. it's always seasoned well and cooked to my liking which is to say a perfectly medium rare piece. my hubby always orders a steak and it has been consistently good.  but what i like most about this steakhouse, especially compared to other station casino steakhouses, are the sides and apps. where most steakhouses put little care into their side dishes, the charcoal room seems to realize that the accompaniments and the main entree are of equal importance. is there anything worse than having a delicious entree when the rest of the food sucks? sometimes i judge a restaurant on whether or not the greens remain crunchy after being cooked. i absolutely hate soggy greens. charcoal room has never served me a soggy vegetable. that's a huge plus, in my book."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.   Came here by chance. Mission was for The Oyster Bar but the wait was so long and I had several beastie drunk friends getting the munchies so we just went next door to The Charcoal Room.   Staff was great. Friendly and helpful.  Some dishes were better than the next but all were not too shabby.   Started with Crab Stuffed Clams and Oyster Rockefeller. Clams were really rich. Too rich I had to eat it with the complimentary bread. Much more enjoyable with the bread.  Oysters were alright... Not much into cooked oysters.  The King Cut Prime Rib and Creamed Corn was delicious! Tender indeed! Those 2 items were my favorite.  Filet Mignon, Roasted Chicken and Lobster Tail were all a tad bit dry.  Final thought...  Overall a good dining experience. Good service, good food, decent prices.   Would definitely come back for the Prime Rib and Creamed Corn."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic food was great service was on point. I had a few reservation requests and they were noted and carried out. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since we dined at Palace Station's steakhouse... It was called Broiler Room back in the day, now the Charcoal Room. We were seated right away, waiter was also there to greet us (Mario). Bread and butter was served immediately along with our water. Mario was very knowledgeable of the menu and he also explained it to us, which was really impressive because we usually don't get that kind of service. My wife ordered the Prime Rib, but was later notified that the end cut was the last since it was close to closing time. I ordered the New York. Salads and side order of potatoes came with our orders as well. For appetizers we had the Fried Calamari, which was great! My steak was a little over cooked but really good cut of meat. Overall, we will back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, especially for those of us in the Northwest!  Two words: Pretzel Bread...I could come here just for that. haha. My boyfriend and I love their Caesar Salad, The Filet with Garlic or Peppercorn Sauces, and the hot bubbly Scalloped Potatoes.   It's an affordable, yet elegant restaurant, dim lights, red theme.  The staff is nice and attentive to your drinks. The hostess and management are pleasant and consistent!   On occasion our service gets slow, but we aren't in a rush when we go to dinner here so that is just fine with us!"}
{"text":"Service was on point! Loved our server Laura!!! Food was impeccable...dessert decadent!"}
{"text":"One of the best steak houses in Vegas. The service is good and the food is terrific. We highly recommend the bone-in ribeye. You will pay at least twice as much on the Strip and it won't be as good."}
{"text":"Had Saturday reservations at 5. Surprised to find that they had a singer starting so early.  After sampling the singer's infernal screeching we asked to sit in the back and were acommodated. I don't like to write long reviews so I will get right to the point.  We didn't get our entrees until 6:50! This was after asking our waitress numerous times what the problem was.  All she would say is \"I'm sorry\", \"I'm sorry\" about a dozen times. Finally I hunted down the manager, who said he would \"look into it\"  No hint of any sense of urgency on his part at all. So we had a waitress who was totally overwhelmed and a manager who was nothing more than an empty suit. After the 1 1/2 hour mark I left, feeling no one on staff really cared or was prepared to do anything. I gave the manager a piece of my mind and stormed out of there.  The rest of our party shortly followed after the food was finally served (cold).  Errors can happen in any restaurant but I have never encountered such utter indifference in my dining career.  I am 68."}
{"text":"Really great steaks. The bone in rib eye was cooked to perfection. I was very happy with the dining experience."}
{"text":"After reading good Yelp reviews on The Charcoal Room, my curiosity piqued. This restaurant is located off Strip at the Palace Station. I recalled we'd been here before when it was \"The Broiler\". They knocked out a few walls, added some pretty lighting, some super comfortable booths...and \"Voila!\", the steakhouse has been resurrected as The Charcoal Room.  A very nice improvement.  As we walked into the restaurant we noticed a comfortable Bar Area and a beautiful wine rack display to our right. Once we were seated we were offered a basket of assorted breads (Pretzel bread was my favorite). Everything on the menu looked good but we settled on the Atlantic Salmon and the Filet. The salmon was good but the Filet Mignon was excellent. Nothing beats a perfectly cooked Filet, in my book! It was deliciously charred on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.   We liked the staff. They were professional and polite on this particular weeknight and not too busy to check on us regularly. We will definitely be back.  The Cons: The restaurant is located in one of Stations Casino's older properties. Palace Station Casino/Hotel is off Strip and a little more run down compared to other Station properties."}
{"text":"The Charcoal Room is located in the Palace Station Casino. The food is very good. The Steakhouse Chopped Salad is wonderful--it served four at our table. The Blackened Salmon and the Pork Chop are perfect, with good sized portions. Very expensive, however. All items are à la carte."}
{"text":"The Charcoal room was delicious. Great food, great prices, great service. As soon as you're seated a nice basket of bread is set on the table with many different options. The ambiance is great and the restaurant itself is very clean and private.   Food: My NY Strip steak was cooked to perfection. It was very tender with a nice crispy outside. The garlic mashed potatoes are heaven! As an appetizer I had the spicy fried calamari.The calamari was very crisp and meaty. I loved everything at The Charcoal room and will definitely be recommending it to my family and friends."}
{"text":"The food was really good. Steaks were high quality, and the prices were reasonable for a new classic steakhouse. Unfortunately, the overall experience was ruined by horrible service.    The waiter(Joe) was nice enough, but we practically had to beg to get or food. It was frustrating watching all the tables around us(who sat after us) move on to dessert when we couldn't get salads or a bread service refill.  They discounted the bill, but I hated having to complain. I felt like a jerk asking for a manager. Our dissatisfaction was obvious; they should have picked up on it and stepped in before we had to ask to see a manager and then wait for him. I still gave a 20% tip on the pre-discounted meal, but I'm bummed that the night went so wrong.  We sat down at 6:40. We didn't leave until after 8:40.   If I would have received a tad bit of empathy from the manager instead of a condescending \"I do apologize\", I wouldn't have written this review.  Act like you care! It goes a long way."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Hands down one of the best steak houses in Vegas! Filet was perfect. Bone in New York was perfect. Au gratin potatoes and lobster mac was amazing! Anthony and Ray provided wonderful service! I can't believe we waited this long to come here, but we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a few years. We stopped by last night and this place is still great. The beginning of the meal we were greeted with a bread basket, which contained sourdough, raisin, and pretzel bread. I am not a fan of raisin, so my boyfriend was happy to devour each slice. I ordered a delicious Roasted Toasted Almond Martini. Next  Crab Cakes, Caesar Salad, and Lobster Chowder. All three were very filling. I had a Petite Sirloin and my boyfriend had a Prime Rib. The meat was cooked  to perfection. Our sides were Au Gratin Potatoes and Sautéed Mushrooms.... We were so full we didn't have room for dessert. This place was great some years ago, and it is still great."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Palace Station and decided to bring our relatives here.  The service was good and the food delicious except for the salmon which was dry.  Since we were guests, we received a coupon for $25 off our dinner per room so we had 3 separate checks, one for each room.  We started off with appetizers which consisted of oysters and crabcakes, both were good.  Our last visit here, the entrees, salads and vegetables were ala carte but they decided to include salad and vegetable with the entree so that's fabulous!  We ordered the salmon, sea bass, pork loin, prime rib and scallops.  All were delicious though my relative said her sea bass tasted fishy but mine was good and moist."}
{"text":"Just re-opened as Charcoal Room. Great decor and very good wait staff. Steak was tender, salads very fresh, and the seafood was excellent. The only downside is the menu. They do not have items other Charcoal Rooms have. Would like to see beet salad, veal chops, halibut,  and more desserts like lemon cake, donuts."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! I ordered the surf n turf. Every single bite was pure heaven. Attentive staff and nice atmosphere. I will definitely return the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"We usually have a great time with delicious food at the Charcoal room.  We had dinner last Saturday and I have to say Im sad.  Our service was horrible.  The waitress seemed like she wanted to be anywhere else but working.  It was only 5:30.  My husbands steak was cold and rubbery and my filet was not cooked at all.  Even the potatoes au gratin were underdone.  It was my brothers b day so we told our waitress and at the end of the meal she practically threw the dessert at us.  We will be looking for a new steakhouse to frequent.  I wish we would have gone somewhere else and paid 280.00."}
{"text":"Our server was Gary and his service was on point. He anticipated our needs, very attentive, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu. The manager came by to ask us about our experience. The food was excellent! We will be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Service was good but the steaks were mediocre. I am not saying it is a bad steak, was just OK, but not for the money. Overpriced and not worth it."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I had so many expectations. Well, they fell short, to say the least. It was my husband's birthday, on top of it. The worst part is, I talked him and another couple into coming. The decorations look like they were taken from an old Denny's. Sorry Denny's! Let me just start with our server. He actually was amazing! The bread was amazing as well. The had all sorts of bread, including raisin bread, which was a surprise.  Well, the salad was a throw away. Meaning, it was so boring and tasteless that we could've thrown them away. No big deal.  I ordered a filet. I will say the filet was one of the best I've ever had. It was medium, like I ordered. My friends ordered medium rare and got medium. My husband ordered the pork and I could tell by the look on his face how bad it was. He normally says something, but didn't. We all ordered mashed potatoes with our meal. The mashed potatoes were more like potato soup, made for people unable to eat salt or any form of spice. So disappointing.  Anyway, our waiter was working his butt off and running around, making sure our drinks were replenished and even brought my husband a slice of chocolate cake, for his birthday."}
{"text":"Steaks were cooked perfectly, Cream spinach was perfect and the lobster macaroni and cheese was outstanding"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Wednesday 11/29/17 9:20pm Server: Carrie Service: Excellent  Carrie made us chocolate martini and spicy bloody Mary in taking rimmed glass. Yum. Drinks are good and generous size/pour. Aside from making excellent drinks, she was very nice and personable.   The seafood Mixer was big enough to share. 2 large shrimp, 2 mussels, 2 clams, calamari, sweet potato & russet potatoe fries all fried to delicious perfection.  Prime Rib sliders were 2 to a plate and also offered on the dinner menu. I asked for no cheese due to allergies, this could've made for a bland dry sandwich but no, these were perfect especially when dipped in the au jus.   Calamari Plate was mixed with peppers and very good. The marinara sauce was meh.  Steakhouse Chopped Salad (not on HH menu) it was huge. Enough for 2 and very very tasty.   PoBoy crab sliders, I didn't try them but was told they were good.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Charcoal Room falls just a hair short of being five stars.  It is, after all, a steakhouse, and my bone-in ribeye was a first class steak - flavorful, tender, and well-cooked.  On top of that, it was reasonably priced and came with a fluffy baked potato and house salad included.  My wife ordered the sea bass, and she raved about it.  We both started with the French Onion Soup, which my wife liked but which I thought was a little salty.  It tasted a bit as if someone had taken a good bowl of onion soup and dropped a beef bouillon cube into it.  So, the food was mostly good.  Now let's back up.  Getting to the restaurant means making your way through the length and breadth of the Palace Station casino, which is somewhat akin to how I imagine travelling steerage on the Titanic must have been.  Once you arrive though, the ambiance is nice - appointed in dark red and black with a slightly retro design.  I would have liked it better if the casino was not visible from our table and - the common scourge of Vegas restaurants - big screen TV's were visible at the bar were playing \"the game.\"  But soft background music ran the gamut from Dean and Frank to rock.  The tables were spaced a bit tightly for my taste, but sitting in one of the booths that ran around the edge of the room was comfortable.  The room was almost empty on a Thursday night, so we were seated immediately.  A nice variety of fresh breads appeared immediately.  Our server, Gary, was quick with the cocktails and quick to take our orders.  Each course was served promptly, and Gary remained attentive throughout the meal.  So, all in all, this was a nice dinner and we will go back.  Also a nice value - cocktails, wine, tax and tip included we  were out the door for about $150.  Pretty good for a high end steak house."}
{"text":"As a visitor in Vegas, I would have never known to go here unless I used Yelp. Off the strip for sure but still in a casino. No reservations needed on. Wednesday night but it filled up fast. I ordered the smaller filet medium rare and it was amazing. Side dishes where roasted corn (just okay) and tater tots which were outstanding. Server and staff continually checked in to ensure we were satisfied. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"pan seared filet mignon is the best I have ever had.... hands down... lobster Mac n cheese is amazing... food here is immaculate... a must go."}
{"text":"Service was great...our server Anthony was very attentive.  Food was good too, we shared 24 oz porterhouse and it was more then enough. Out of everything we had, spinach salad and steak were the standouts.  Value was incredible, we did have $25 coupon we got in the mail, but even without it still a good value.  We had 3 martinis, ahi app, spinach salad, oysters, porterhouse and 2 sides. Bill was only $112.00 before $25 off.  For sure we would go again, dont let the fact that its in santa fe casino stop you from going."}
{"text":"Tried this steakhouse inside the Sante Fe casino after hearing great things but I'm sad to say I was left disappointed. The service was about the only thing that was great. The food itself lacked flavor. Nothing stood out In my mind. My ribeye was overly fatty and Although I asked for it to be cooked medium, it was definitely still \"mooing\" at me, meaning it was very rare. The mashed potatoes were dry And the creamed spinach was super oily. Sad to say it was not my favorite place."}
{"text":"Located inside the Santa Fe Station, the Charcoal Room is a fantastic steakhouse that offers great food at affordable prices!  Tastefully decorated in browns and reds, the room is very warm and inviting. This was actually my first time trying any Charcoal Room as a group of six of us were here to celebrate a friends birthday.   Items ordered..  - Bone-in New York Steak (5/5) Seriously one huge slab of meat! The pics do NOT do it justice! Perfectly cooked medium. That sucker never stood a chance! Very tasty. Very juicy. Absolutely scrumptious! ($32)  - Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes (4/5) Good sized portion, especially for the price. Very delicious. ($6)  - Mac and Cheese (regular) (4/5) Again, a very generous portion and very tasty mac and cheese! Nice crusty topping with plenty of cheesy goodness just below! ($6)  -Tater tots (3/5) Basket full of tots. Once again, a very generous portion. They were okay. Maybe they just couldn't keep up with the rest of the items we ordered, but they certainly weren't bad. I probably wouldn't get them next time, though.  ($6)  - Service was fantastic! We were treated VERY well here! We were seated immediately. Glasses were refilled in a timely manner. We were served plenty of bread. Our server was very outgoing and friendly. I was quite pleased with the service we got here.  Actually, I was quite pleased with our whole experience here! You really get a lot of value for what you pay here! The prices are a fraction of what you might pay at other places, but you don't have to sacrifice great food and great service for it! I can't wait to come back!  4 solid stars."}
{"text":"Purchased a Resturant.com certificate a year ago and can't believe I waited so long to use it.  The food was way better than I remembered and the Manager was amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to have a nice dinner for a special occasion and until the last minute, couldn't decide where to go.  We live pretty close to Palace Station and used to dine in their old restaurant, The Broiler, pretty often a few years back.  I had heard from someone at work that The Charcoal Room was good and we should try it sometime so I suggested it to my husband and we decided to head over there.   The room was obviously renovated from The Broiler days which isn't a bad thing but it unfortunately now has windows looking on to the casino which has decidedly ruined the ambiance. They need to frost the windows or something... the \"view\" is atrocious.  We were seated in the booth right behind the hostess station which I think was a punishment for having no reservation (although, the room was half empty). It was fine until the noise from the machines right outside of the open doors of the restaurant reached a crescendo of binging, beeps and ringing where we kept having to ask the other to repeat themselves.  At that point, we asked our sever, Timothy, if the doors could be closed due to the noise which he promptly got permission for and did. It was amazing what an improvement that was. The next time we go, we will be sure to request a booth near the back of room which looked much more quiet and inviting.  Now, the food... We were happily surprised to see the wine list and menu prices. It was very reasonable. We had a bottle of Kendall Jackson Cabernet (one of our favorites) for only $40. We were also pleased that the meals included the house side salad and choice of potato - like the \"good ol' days\". When Timothy (Tim), came to take our order, he said that the special was surf and turf - 2- 7oz petite filets and a 28 oz Maine lobster tail  to share... that was a winner!  It was also reasonable at $99 for the dinner for two. The house salad was fresh and delicious and the main course, was perfect!  Everything cooked perfectly and hot. The lobster was some of the best we ever had. We decided that the next time we will order the NY steak and lobster entrees separately and just share them as we both enjoy that cut more than the filets. We shared the rice pudding for dessert and although, it wasn't the best we had, it was good enough.  Overall, I would say that the service was excellent. The food was also some of the best we have had in a while... reminiscent of Old Vegas and being natives, that is right up our alley. Frost those windows, Palace Station, and set up the entrance a little differently and you have a real winner!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stayed in Vegas for 6 days and ate at \"the best (top dollar) steak houses and seafood restaurants in Vegas\".  This place knocked our socks off.  We loved it so much we ate here two nights in a row.  Romantic atmosphere and Stacey and Laura both professional and very knowledgable about the huge assortment of wine.      Recommend the special....2 fillets and a 28oz lobster tail...with a salad and side for $99.  WOW delicious"}
{"text":"We came in and took a seat at the bar,the bartender vanya was nice,speedy with the drinks! We then sat in brians section,he suggested the scallops,very succulent!my girlfriend had a petite filet,cooked to perfection,i love this place!we will be back!"}
{"text":"The Charcoal Room is located inside the Palace Station Casino in Las Vegas.  Not wanting something too heavy, I opted to get just soup (the lobster chowder) to jump start a night of feasting, which would culminate at the famous Oyster Bar at Palace Station.  The oysters were fresh and slightly sweet, lacking much brininess (which is fine by me). I used lemon, cocktail sauce, and horseradish.  The lobster chowder was surprisingly filling, decadent, and rich. There were adequate bits of lobster. The soup was thick, creamy, and quite indulgent. I also got to try the crab cakes, which were splendid as well. The coating was crispy and light; the meat was fresh and tender.  I would definitely return to the Charcoal Room. They have some pretty good looking steaks. I'd for sure try the prime rib next time!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite steakhouse to recommend and this is my second time going to the Charcoal Room. It's a great place, lovely settings, friendly staff, and of course, great tasting food. To me, the location was great, since I live here in Vegas, its just a few miles away from home, located inside Sante Fe Casino.   As for the food, the first time went, I started off with the Bacon covered BBQ shrimps. Presentation was good, taste was great, I really loved it a lot. I would of order it again, but with the fact of my wife sharing her BBQ boneless baby back ribs, last trip, I loved those even more. So, on this visit, I just had to order a plate, for me. Other then that, we had mash potatoes and broccoli, but of course, the STEAKS. On my first visit I had the Fillet Minion 12oz, loved it so much, I had to order it again on this trip. Again, presentation was great, taste was fabulous, over all, my tummy was satisfied once again. If it wasn't for the bread basket, The BBQ boneless baby back ribs, the mash potato , the broccoli and the multiple refills of Pepsi, I probably would of done dessert. I'm sure dessert would of been fulfilling, but I was already fulfilled after making my 12oz fillet minion disappear.   Sure enough, I would return to the Charcoal Room whenever I get a chance. It is kind of pricey, but take it from me, its worth every penny."}
{"text":"Service here was horrible.  We asked our waiter for things 2 or 3 times but never received them.  We waited forever for our food.  And the restaurant was only 10% full!  I wanted to leave but my S/O convinced me to stay.  Waiter was unapologetic.  Food was ok.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Amazing! Laura the waitress took excellent care of our 17 person bachelor party table in our private room.  The sides were delicious and the bone in rib eye was excellent! Best meal I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to a wonderful dinner. It was awful. We had the chicken marsala. There was no taste of marsala wine it was cheap store bought gravy.The chicken itself was a chunk of breast meat that was completely dried out.We couldn't even cut it with our steak knives. The broccolini that we ordered was cooked in some kind of rancid oil. Because I was handicapped it's kind of a big ordeal getting into the restaurant. We asked our waiter to please just box it up. But what we did was drop it off at the nearest garbage can. I have only had chicken marsala that was a pounded chicken cutlet. This was a hunk of dried up chicken. The wine is very expensive and a very small amount the mashed potatoes were dry with no taste. We will never return we really felt ripped off."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service...period!  My date and I sat there talking until they closed.  They never asked us to leave nor do we feel pressured to leave.  I have never had better service.  I had crab cake appetizer and lobster tail.  5 star on both!"}
{"text":"I would only recommend this place if the cafe was closed and you just had to spend money at Palace. I had a dining credit and was still underwhelmed by the food.   Had dinner Monday 7/18.   House salad is a bag mix with a few cucumbers and a COUPLE spring pieces. Not one crouton, but I guess the one cherry tomato was supposed to hide that fact.   Spicy calamari was overcooked so that ot was hard to chew. Peppers tasted like pure brine, no heat at all.   I had the \"top\" sirloin. Overcooked. Baked potato had been sitting based on temperature and texture. Asked for mash as a replacement. Whipped potatoes came that look like something from the buffet.   Overall hated it. Even if free wouldnt go back or recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome delicious steaks. Great staff. See my photos. Price point is amazing for ambiance and food quality. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"My second visit, again, I was here to see another movie I was anticipating and wanted to have a repeat of another steak dinner since my first visit.  This time I sat at the bar and it turns out, my bartender was Jesus, who happened to have been my waiter from my previous first visit.  When I ordered my drinks, he asked if I had been there before & I said, \"yes.\"  I was impressed that he remembered me.  Later, Amber came along to take my order.   I decided to try a new offering: honey glazed pork belly.  I also ordered the large fillet mignon with hollandaise sauce and a side of Mac n cheese.  I loved the pretzel bread so much from my first visit that I was given just that.  Same thing, warm bread and room temperature butter. So delicious!  And shortly after my starter arrived and what a combination!  The pork belly was tender, great flavor and nestled on a small bed of spring greens, and the tartness of the balsamic drizzle mixed paired well with the honey glaze.   My steak and Mac n cheese arrived at the same time.   WoW!   The steak cooked perfectly cooked rare and seasoned that when cutting into it, was effortless.   Dipped in a creamy hollandaise sauce made the two a perfect match.  The Mac n cheese topped with nice toasty bread crumbs with a cheesy, creamy body put my meal all together.  I like this place.   I like the customer experience, I love the ambiance, the food is definitely the entertainment.  If you're visiting this casino and want to enjoy a nice dining experience.   Consider this place. You deserve a good night out.  :)"}
{"text":"Best prime rib ever.  Also loved steakhouse chopped salad, lobster chowder, seared ahi tuna, and mac & cheese.  Not impressed with the creamed corn or beer selection."}
{"text":"Me and my fiance enjoyed our food, very friendly and calm environment, we will be going again. Thanks for an awesome service"}
{"text":"Service is below average. Our main course took forever. Our waiter (Joe) was very pleasant.  Maybe something needs to be done with their kitchen?   Ordered ribeye, it was good but nothing amazing.   I really wanted to like this restaurant. Sadly, would not return."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food. The mashed potatoes were wonderful. Not soggy but perfect. The steak was delish and made to order. Hubby was pleased. I liked the half chicken, the skin on the chicken tasted fried, which I just took off. The meat itself was flavorful especially with the yummy gravy which also was excellent over the mashed. No complaints. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Love the Charcoal  Room...my husband  & I ate here several times...however, the last time our party got sick so we haven't  been back. I do recall the flu was going around, who knows maybe an employee  was sick but more than likely we will return, just giving it a break so the last experience  will be completely removed from our taste buds. The customer  service  is always great!"}
{"text":"Supremely disappointed at their lackluster implementation of reservations. My wife and I made a reservation online using Open Table. My wife and I walked in this evening -- Saturday -- and were told by the hostess Brenda that it wouldn't be until 8pm that we'd be seated. The hostess then got the manager when we complained about the wait time. He informed us that Open Table doesn't matter since -- according to him -- it doesn't track walk-ins. Unbeknownst to him I'm the former lead web developer for Station Casinos (the owner) here in town. So, I know that walk-ins are trackable in Open Table. You just have to be willing to enter them into the system."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. We decided to stop by for my partner's birthday and I'm glad we did.  First, Gary, our waiter, was nothing short of amazing. From beginning to end, he was exceptional. He recommended great wine pairing for our steaks. When I mentioned it was a birthday dinner, he made sure we got a complementary dessert which I will touch on later.  The food was just mouth watering. From our calamari appetizer to my porterhouse steak, everything was on point.  The dessert, well that carrot cake slice was big enough for both of us to share and left over. Just great.  The only thing I do have to say is that when we requested to have a well done steak, they didn't seem to know how to cook one just right. It was cooked outside well done but the inside was still like my medium steak. I know some people say that you shouldn't eat a steak well done but if someone likes that, they should be able to get it done. Other than that, it was an amazing experience. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This is a locals steakhouse! Unpretentious, reasonably-priced, steakhouse dining at its best. Charcoal Room is a restaurant where I don't have to worry about dressing to the nines, or feeling uneasy when a stranger drapes a white cloth napkin over my lap.   Starters: The fried calamari is crunchy and delicious, and there no fillers, just all calamari with a side of peppers and dipping sauces.   Entrees and dessert: The NY Steak is absolutely delectable and flavorful. However, the pan seared sea bass is my favorite dish on the menu; it's tender and the meat melts in your mouth. There are plenty of sides to choose from, and I like how there's the option to select how you want your greens cooked (sauteed, steamed, or creamed). If you still have room, their decadent chocolate cake is a perfect way to end dinner."}
{"text":"I absolutely love eating here. Excellent food and phenomenal service EVERY TIME! We have tried almost everything on their menu. There isn't anything I wouldn't recommend. With that being said my favorite items are their scallops from their appetizer menu (they are available as either an entree or an appetizer....each one is prepared and seasoned differently) and their salmon for an entree. I also have to say that their bartender Kari makes the  ABSOLUTE BEST BLOODY MARY'S IN TOWN!"}
{"text":"Okay, I definitely want to come back here. The steak was heavenly and the mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms were absolutely scrumptious! Get your wallets out because you'll be spending some dough here. Great place to go if you're celebrating an anniversary or something romantic."}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment :( The service was slow and the servers (attractive) paid more attention to the 2 other booths that had attractive men sitting at it.  We had a reservation for 5:00 pm and got seated at 5:20 pm. The pretzel bread stick thingys were delicious but the only good thing about the meal. I ordered a filet. it was tough and had no flavor. I would have went to Applebee's if I wanted a steak that looked more like meatloaf. For the $50 my portion cost I just wasn't happy. Does anyone remember when they had a steak house called \"Kodiak\"? Those were the good ole days oh how I miss that place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside Palace Station Casino.  The ambiance is pretty swanky. The menu has just the right amount of choices, and not overwhelming.  Our friends showed up right on time as we moved from the table (which was small to our liking) to a spacious comfortable booth. A fresh basket of bread is bought to our table, variety of bread such as raisin, sourdough, and pretzel bread.   Jesus, our nice waiter, got our drink order. He was attentive.  The Wedge Salad, and Sesame Crusted Tuna were flavorful. Maple Glazed Pork Belly was ok. My favorite appetizer was the Seared Scallops. The depths of these bay scallops were very perfectly cooked. Our friends enjoyed their meal as well.  Wine and cocktails were a little pricey as was the food but I'm sure it's way cheaper than the Strip. If you're looking for a nice higher end steak place with great service, check out this restaurant."}
{"text":"My girls and I came here for a GNO after a friend recommended the place. I'm so glad we took her advice because this is going to be a regular spot for us. Our waiter Brian came shortly to our table and greeted us with his adorable smile. He was so sweet and patient with us. He suggested a bottle of Chardonnay to start our night and we were all for it. Drinks came quick and we were ready to order. We ordered the seared tuna, crab dip, and oysters as appetizers. Tuna was fresh, crab dip had chunks of crab in it, and oysters were great with the different sauces. For dinner we had the sea bass pan seared, lamb chops, lobster tail and salmon seared. I was stuffed but kept eating because I wanted to try all the dishes. Everything was delicious and service was amazing. Throughout our meal, Brian was very attentive and made sure we enjoyed our meal. I would highly recommend this place for their food and service."}
{"text":"The food at the hotel is getting better the Oyster Bar and this restaurant R a good improvement the lobster was enormous the size of a football but it was an off the menu option you have to ask for the asparagus was cooked to perfection my steak left something to be desired for the price but definitely worth stopping in"}
{"text":"Bad services. Food just passing grade. Food comes out Luke warm. Ordered medium rare steak came out as medium well. Wait for 10 mins just for the to go box at the end of the meal. Food presentation sucks. Just a piece of fish/steak in the middle of white plate. Boring. Won't recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great! My family tends to come here for super special occasions, like my grandparents' 60th wedding anniversary last week. They make it easy to book a table for 10 in advance, which resulted in getting a table smack-dab in the middle of everything, making for quick & vigilant service.  It seems like each & every time, my sisters and I start throwing elbows for the pretzel bread they bring out at the beginning. It's just so good! Especially with a bowl of their French onion soup. .....Yes, it appears I have mastered the art of filling up on soup & bread before the real meal arrives, BUT that does notstop me from ordering the King Cut Prime Rib anyway. So good and sooo worth having to be rolled out the restaurant afterward.  I had to knock one star off for the lack of bread refills (I know this isn't Olive Garden, but goddamn, that pretzel bread is too good) and the grumpy waitress we had. She seemed annoyed & impatient with us when we asked questions or took too long to order. I felt genuinely bad having to ask for anything else from her, so I skipped out on a second glass of wine..."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place as we were wondering through the casino. The servers were warm, friendly and very helpful. Our waiter and waitress gave us good advice in helping us make our selections for dinner. They are a little on the pricey side, but it was worth every dollar. Our prime rib was seasoned well and was cooked to a perfection."}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse for the buck in Vegas.  I love the ambience - service is great and the fresh bread they serve is so good I get full just eating it before the actual meal arrives.   Their salads are yummy specially the Butter Lettuce - also that alone is a full meal. I've had the Ribeye steak here quite a few times and it melts in your mouth but on this visit i had the Chilean Seabass which was amazing!   This is not in the strip therefore not as glamorous but definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"The steak was great but that was all. The service was terrible. I asked 3 times for some water and ended up leaving without any. They didn't clean any dishes from the table from appetizers on.  The $12 shrimp cocktail tastes like rubber shrimp. Sad really I'm a local and will never be back ."}
{"text":"We  enjoyed dinner here last weekend. Great hidden treasure in the Santa Fe casino! I had the petite filet mignon and my guy had the Ribeye steak. Both were cooked to perfection and we had some tasty sides too. I'd highly recommend this fine restaurant. Our server was fast & friendly - thanks Diane!"}
{"text":"The Charcoal Room was a first time for my husband and I. We were celebrating our 4 year wedding anniversary.  When I called to make reservations the actual restaurant phone was not taking messages because the VM was full.   When the answering service \"operator\" took my reservations she asked if it was a special occasion  or just to dine.  I specifically  told her our anniv. She congratulated me and stated she would make a note.  We were welcomed by the host who seemed irritated or bothered. Manuel was nice , he said he was helping Anthony. But to be honest all Anthony dud was take our order. Manuel as the one who refilled our water and asked us if we needed anything , then boxed our leftovers.  Anthony was there to just act as if did something and have us the bill and quickly turned to what seemed like regulars.   The food was fabulous. The owner walked passed twice and asked how was everything ?But didn't stop to listen to our response. I noticed she did stop to ask the same question to others too but then did listen for there reply.   Throughout the evening no one mentioned our anniversary as the operator stated she would make a note of it.  Maybe they just didn't care but it would have been nice to at least wish us best wishes. Whatever.  If we ever decide to eat the charcoal room it will be to carry out. I can make it more peaceful at home or wherever with just the two of us and not so much rudeness. Seem to me the workers judge who's going to be a better table? From what I've seen Caucasians got more attention,smiles and better service than my husband and I who are both minorities."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place for many years and for many years it has been great which is why when our last two visits were not very good with that we give it one more try. The food simply has lost its wow factor.  The service is going downhill... Not to the fault of the servers it's about understaffing a restaurant.   I waited 45 minutes for my water to be refilled on the last three visits... Not really cool. I'm not sure what changed or what happened to the Charcoal room but it's now just an average restaurant in the casino like so many others and in Las Vegas... Average simply does not cut it.    I'm sorry but you've lost a regular"}
{"text":"Worst prime rib I have ever had. While in town for CES, we had a hard time making a reservation at several steakhouses so finally were relieved to find The Charcoal Room had space immediately. Now I see why. The service was a bit saccharine - our waitress was polite but not necessarily knowledgeable in what to suggest. I felt she was merely sharing what she presumed was popular as opposed to what was actually good. It didn't matter anyway. The sides were enormous but hard to enjoy without the main entree. Then after waiting at least 30 minutes for the food the arrive, the prime rib was thoroughly over done. I'm not a picky eater and have happily grazed on food most meticulous eaters would scoff at but this was an abhorrence. The meat was extremely tough to cut through and not for just me - for every single person in our 5 person party. Even for my colleague who ordered fillet mignon, his serving was almost unrecognizable. To top it off, the manager walked by and ask how everything was. In hindsight, we probably should have complained but we were tired from a day at the conference and not convinced we would have been properly compensated for our dissatisfaction anyway. Lesson learned: sometimes it best to wait and I'm never going back to Palace Station."}
{"text":"Tough steak, expensive. I don't mind paying good money for a great meal. But not good for the price. Enough said"}
{"text":"Allow me to take you on a trip in my virtual DeLorean.  Strap in, sit back, and relax.  The flux capacitor is fluxing.  There!  See, that wasn't too bad.  Were now back in 2006.  October 2006, to be more precise.  Now here's my review...  My wife and I celebrated our three-year wedding anniversary at The Charcoal Room, a cozy little steakhouse located inside Santa Fe Station (a \"local's casino\" situated in the northwest part of town). In the more than ten years that we've been together, we've had the pleasure of dining at several fine restaurants across the country, from Aureole in New York City to Donovan's in La Jolla. And, as denizens of Sin City, we've also experienced some of the best food and beverage offerings available on the infamous Las Vegas Strip. I guess you can say that we are \"foodies\" by definition, and as such it takes quite a bit to impress us. With that said, however, the folks at The Charcoal Room did just that.  The place was pretty empty when we got there. I think there may have been two other occupied tables in the room and maybe two or three people at the bar. Needless to say, I would've been really disappointed if the service had left us wanting. The good news is that our server, I want to say his name was Anthony, and his assistants did very well. They were attentive, upbeat, speedy, and they demonstrated well-polished tableside manners. No complaints about the wait staff here!  Timing-wise, everything came out properly.  Where this restaurant really surprises and delights is in the quality of its food. Here's what we ordered:      * Bacon-Wrapped Scallops (as our appetizer)     * Glass of Pinot Noir - one of Francis Coppola's reds     * Caesar Salad for Two     * 12oz Filet Mignon - Medium but Charred (for me)     * 12oz Filet Mignon - Medium Well (for my wife)     * Au Gratin Potatoes     * Sautéed Mushrooms     * Some kind of chocolate cake and molten peanut butter confection  Phenomenal food! With the restaurant's pricing, I was expecting the food quality to register just a notch or two above what's available at Outback Steakhouse (the filets were only USD$30 each). But when I cut into my tender morsel of red meat goodness and chomped down on that sucker, boy, was I pleasantly surprised! Perfectly charred on the outside, just right in the middle, and superbly flavored. And the rest of the food was equally as good!  Compared to certain overpriced and overhyped rooms (i.e., the \"fine\" steakhouse located inside the Bellagio), The Charcoal Room is a breath of fresh air.  So far, I believe the best steak in town is offered at Del Frisco's. Second best can be found at Craftsteak inside the MGM Grand. Third best is served up at Fiore's Steakhouse inside The Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino. Fourth calls Delmonico's at The Venetian its home. The fifth best steak is delivered by the talented folks at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris Las Vegas. And sixth best? You guessed it, The Charcoal Room. Not bad for a \"local's\" restaurant, methinks.  Overall Rating: Excellent Food Rating: Outstanding Staff Rating: Excellent Ambiance Rating: Good"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful, romantic dinner here. We made a reservation, but probably didn't need to. They promptly brought us an awesome bread basket & water. Our server was super nice and attentive. We both ordered a filet and upgraded our salads to a wedge. The wedge was awesome!!! Can not rate the Gorgonzola dressing highly enough. Steaks were good, just a tad over cooked for our taste, but still yummy. Loved the outside of the steaks. Mashed potatoes on point! And the prices are AWESOME! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We met here to surprise my mother-in-law for her 80th birthday.  We'd made the reservations weeks in advance and at that time, we'd discussed the fact that there would be a vegetarian (me) in the party.  They assured us that they could accommodate a vegetarian.    I will say the ambience is nice and there was a table of 8 ready for us at the designated time.  Having said that, the wait staff was efficient but not personable.  We had two small children with us and (as any parent knows), time is of the essence in term of getting food on the table for them.  I ordered their food early and they seemed a bit put out, even though there were multiple pediatric litanies of \"I'm hungry!,\" no bread basket appeared until long after we were seated.    To be fair, the meat-eaters all seemed happy with their food.  The dish that the chef \"whipped up\" for me was, I kid you NOT, a plate with four steamed vegetables--that's it.  Not a protein, a grain, a seed, a starch, a noodle, or a sauce.  NOTHING.  What?!  In 2017, in a time when plant-based diets are becoming increasingly adopted, THIS is REALLY the best you can do.  They should be ashamed.    The dessert tray was nice and our selections were tasty.  Fellow vegetarians....be warned!"}
{"text":"They are so accommodating and friendly. I'm a frequent patron of The Charcoal Room and I have to say it's the best place off the strip to dine. Patrick, a member of the management team, is more than accommodating. All of the staff is VERY friendly, polite, and professional; and I can say that although I am probably not their target customer, I am never made to feel less... Or unvalued. Joseph, who often services me, is an especially exemplary employee and I always make sure to let him know how much I appreciate him being so attentive and kind. Also, the food is amaaaazing!!!  Thank you to the amazing team here and The Charcoal Room"}
{"text":"The Charcoal Room is a solid restaurant.  I had a reservation to eat here before going to a show at the Smith Center.  I was promptly seated and soon brought water and then iced tea.  I was thinking of getting French onion soup but I noticed that steaks come with house salad and baked or mashed potatoes.  Asking my server about the size of the salad, he assured me it was large.  I opted to forego an appetizer and go instead with the 10 ounce filet, house salad with blue cheese dressing, and baked potato with butter, sour cream, and chives.  For dessert, I ordered carrot cake.  The salad was indeed very large with iceberg and romaine lettuce along with cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and some other items.  The blue cheese dressing was very good and the server ground fresh pepper to taste.  The steak was a little too done for my order of blue.  It was more on the rare side than being less done than that.  I think too many chefs want to make sure they have a char look that they overcook when ordering blue.  The steak was very tasty and quite tender.  The vermouth mushroom butter ($2 charge) made no difference in taste.  The mushroom flavor nor vermouth were there.  I'd get the steak naked another time.  The baked potato was stuffed with the things mentioned above and was good.  For dessert, I ordered the carrot cake.  It was a large slice of classic cake.  It was a bit dry, however, as if it had been the exposed end from the day before.  It was more plain carrot cake without a lot of spice as some bakers do and except for the dryness, it was quite good.  Service was excellent.    I am of two opinions about bundling the salad and potato as part of the cost of the steak.  On the one hand, I like the fact that you're not being charged a lot for separate items in your meal.  On the other hand, it would be nice to have soup instead of a salad and I'd order French fries any day of the week before I'd get a baked potato.    I was made aware by my server that the sides were all very large so I stayed with just the potato that came with the meal and that was more than enough.  This is an OK place to have dinner."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 6 PM and arrived a few minutes in advance.  I was shown to a table in the bar area which was OK because I watched the baseball game during the meal.  I ordered my iced tea, got some bread, and got ready to enjoy a steak.  I only ate one piece of bread--the salted pretzel bread.  Very good.    I started with a lobster chowder which was a lot like New England clam chowder but with lobster.  There was a good amount of lobster and the chowder was good.  Next, I had the bone in ribeye cooked blue.  The waiter said they averaged 22 to 24 ounces with the bone.  It was a nicely cooked large steak done almost perfectly.  The steak evidently wasn't pre-seasoned with any salt and pepper and I found myself putting salt on the steak.  As a side, I got the grilled corn with chipotle mayo.  That was the standout dish of the night.  The mayo and a nice spicy kick from the chipotle and when mixed into the corn, it made for a great side.  For dessert, they bring a cart to your table and show you the goods.  I went with the carrot cake.  The cake was quite large and it was very good.  The interesting thing about the carrot cake were the thin carrot shreds that were lightly candied giving a crunchy texture to the cake.  It almost seemed like the carrot shreds had been fried although they weren't.  Very nice touch.  Service was very good throughout.  My iced tea was refilled without needing to ask.  There's one suggestion I'd make.  I know you want to show an open restaurant to your clients, but when I'm in a casino steakhouse, I'd rather have the doors shut so I don't listen to slot machine sounds during dinner.  The Charcoal Room is OK."}
{"text":"Steaks are great. So far I've enjoyed the ribeye, porterhouse, and New York prime all medium rare and have never been disappointed. Mushrooms are not as salty as other steakhouses.  The horseradish mash potatoes are my second favorite(wasabi mash at Cali hotel is #1).  The servers and bussers takes care of you, and takes your experience to the next level. It is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Food was great and exceeded expectations. We have been to many other steak houses in the city and this is easily in the Top 3 if not #1. All 4 filets ordered were cooked perfectly, the sides were great portion sizes for the price and the staff was friendly/service was fast.   It also is worth noting that the Sante Fe Casino itself has been cleaned and updated since our last visit. I noted new carpet throughout, a new concert area and updated movie theater."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  The $44 (11oz) lobster tail turned out to be 3 ounces and so tough we sent it back.  We ordered prime rib and were unable to cut it with a steak knife.  What has happened to this superb steakhouse?  Just 2 months ago the food was delicious but, like other Santa Fe restaurants, the quality of the food has declined significantly.  Has there been a change in ownership or management?   Don't waste your time dining here..."}
{"text":"I met a friend here last night and the food was terrible.  I used to go here often and the food was always terrific and the service excellent.  The bartenders knew what wine you drank and would customize the bread basket for you.  They changed the menu about a month ago and downgraded on the quality. They still have Ahi Tuna on the appetizer menu but it is not the same quality as in the past.  It tasted \"off\" and didn't even look edible.  My friend ordered the Chopped salad and the portion is about 2/3 of what it used to be on the old menu.  The bread basket consisted of 4 tiny pieces of bread that looked like it had seen better days.  They also took away the flatbread - which was the best part of the bread basket!  They changed the wine menu and my pour for a $16 glass of Peju was awful - if I was a bartender I would be embarrassed serving such a paltry amount.  Even the service was bad.  One bartender (new) who ignored us the the entire time.  Note to management:  Either restore the old menu and raise the prices or change the restaurant to a more casual atmosphere where you can get away with serving cheap food."}
{"text":"5 star steaks at close to half the price!!!  That pretty much sums up my review for the Charcoal Room.  Don't let the fact that both Charcoal Rooms in Las Vegas is located inside a Station Casino.  This Charcoal Room and the one located inside the Sante Fe Station doesn't seem to get a lot of Yelp attention and I have no idea why.  For me, it's all about service, value, and taste. The Charcoal room delivers on all three.  First of all, service is \"as good as it gets\". You rarely have to wait, your orders are taken quick, food doesn't take forever, and your drinks are kept full.  And don't be surprised if almost every employee stops what they're doing to greet you.  Now that's what I call service.  The steaks at the Charcoal Room rival some of the high end establishments around town.  I swear, the Charcoal Room should have a blind taste test with the other steak joints out here.  I bet they come out on top or at least close. Their steaks are pretty damn good and literally melt in your mouth.  I have also tried their lobster, king crab legs, every side, most of their desserts, and some of their salads.  Besides their dry carrot cake, everything that I sampled didn't disappoint.  Trust me with this mini, non-informative review.  You can't go wrong with the Charcoal Room ."}
{"text":"Finally!!   I've had the Charcoal Room on my list of eats since I moved out here a few years ago.  My neighbor, some co-workers, and even friends/family from California even recommended the Charcoal Room to me. But when it came to other Yelpers, most haven't been here or reviewed them.  The Charcoal Room has a lot of pros and very little cons.  You don't get what you pay for here, you get more.  And if you're having steak, you get a lot more.  I got their petite filet and it was delicious.  Their petite is about 6 oz, juicy, and most importantly, very tasty. Don't let the price fool you.  For less than $30, I had a steak that rivals some of the 5 star steak houses out here.  My filet was so tender that I think I used a butter knife to cut through it.  I had my steak with a side of their Caesar salad, lobster corn chowder, sautéed mushrooms, and asparagus.  All portions were huge and I ended up with leftovers. My GF opted for their roasted chicken and baked sweet potato.  Her meal was hooked up too.  I swear she was served half a chicken and a football sized sweet potato.  She said her meal was good as well.    I have no complaints about the service.  We were seated right away, our orders were taken, and our food was served in a timely manner.  I left the Charcoal Room very satisfied and my only regret is not coming here sooner.  We got a lot of food and paid less than $100 for it.  Yes...I'm sure I will be back.   PS: No pictures of their steak and no pictures of their fabulous forks.  I was focused the night I ate here....focused on my beautiful date.  1OAK!"}
{"text":"Great manager, he came to the table at beginning to welcome our table. Started with wine, bread, 3 varieties We had ceasar salad, shared a bone in rib eye, 20oz. And potatoe. Our table had broiled scallops and asperagus. Delisious."}
{"text":"Charcoal Room, we are breaking up.  It's not me it's you, you have changed and not for the better.  Last week my husband and I went to T-Bones Chophouse at Red Rock, and it made me miss The Charcoal Room.  So this week we made our reservations, and I had one thing on my mind, boneless baby back ribs.  My most favorite thing here has changed.  I thought they were made of pork but these were beef and seemed like instead of baby backs, they were more like spare ribs.  They changed the meat and the quality on me and kept the price.  Sad day.   We had reservations at five, but they didn't open on time.  Service wasn't as good as it was before and I felt like we got a little attitude because we didn't order alcohol.  The last slap was a cheap \"Thank You\" take out bag and generic Styrofoam to go containers instead of the classic red string reusable bag they had before.  I know it seems silly, but if you are spending sixty dollars plus a head for dinner, dressing up and bother to make a reservation, you want a good experience right down the the last detail.  The search for a new favorite is on."}
{"text":"Excellent across the board! Steak was awesome and cooked as ordered, wedge salad is as good as I've ever had, side mushrooms were great! Nothing I can't like about this place? Go! You will love the food and the prices"}
{"text":"This may have just been my experience but frankly it was horrible!!! I ordered my steak medium, it came well done. Sent it back and it came back rare.... actually more than rare. The restrooms were disgusting and the whole experience left a horrible taste in my mouth.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short but sweet,,,,,friendly staff. wasn't expecting much but food was amazing I had the crab cakes n calamari for apps excellent, wife had lobster tail son had ny steak n I had the lamb chops all cooked to perfection also potato au gratin delicious sautéed asparagus very good.....cant wait to return to THE CHARCOAL ROOM"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service here is terrible. Waited 15mins for someone to refill my water, servers were rude, and I didn't feel welcomed with the 5 people I brought. I will not be dining here ever again."}
{"text":"I purposely mentioned when making my reservation that it was our anniversary and we would like a booth. The hostess walked us to a table way in the back, and when i mentioned that i had requested a booth, she got an attitude. I asked if we could wait for one to be made up, and she stated \"i have one all the way up front by the door\" and had some snarky remark yet again. Fine dining and hospitality? The food was outback quality at best. The filet literally tasted like a BK burger, and no one checked on us until we were half way through. Also, the table next to us was asked if they were celebrating anything. We were not, even though I mentioned it upon making the reservation.  So if you're celebrating something, hit the strip."}
{"text":"Pretty impressive menu. The meat selections were great, they also have a bone-in NY strip. The sides and salads are huge so they can be shared. Overall, worth the drive to the Santa Fe off the strip."}
{"text":"Who would have guessed a great steakhouse in the Palace Station???  The Charcoal Room was great. We had dinner for a bachelor party there (Group of 13). The food was great. I highly recommend the Ribeye. But even more so was the service. Our server, Joseph, was fantastic. He was full of suggestions and very attentive.   Add to the great food and service a very reasonable price and you have a true gem. A fraction of the cost we would have paid on the strip. That money was out to much better use later in the evening."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I do not eat steak... except for when I come here! No place can cook its steak as amazing as the Charcoal Room does! The lobster corn chowder is fantastic! Their baked potatoes are huge! Just everything about this place is amazing! Must go!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great dinner there.  Easy to find in the casino. Easy parking.  Prices are really reasonable. You can pay so much more at other steakhouses on the strip for the same meal.  Started with oysters that were good, but small.  My petit filet was excellent. Loved the chop salad.  My husband's bone in rib eye was perfect on the outside, but a bit under cooked on the inside for medium (medium rare in the middle near the bone). But he said it still had good flavor.  We ordered the sautéed mushrooms, asparagus and broccoli. All were really good (not huge portions, but enough).  Waitress didn't know what whiskey they offered (she couldn't name one). So my husband jumped in asking if they had MakersMark. They did. It was a nice pour, but it would have been good to know what other options there were.  The house zin was good.  All in all a ready good dinner. We will definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"For the price, I would expect much more. The food was not very good. Do yourself a favor and go to Olives at the Bellagio instead."}
{"text":"Wait....No....I want to go back!!! The food was so good! The seafood platter fed four and was excellently priced. It has Lobster and King crab as well as jumbo prawn and fresh oysters. The potatoes? The lobster bisque?...all primo! The service? Fantastic! Our servers were honest and down to earth. None of that fake \"can I help you\" because I'm trying to make money stuff. We had real authentic service. The drinks? Common but strong enough to leave a positive impression. My group really liked the openness of the place and the seating was very comfortable. They even had a walk in wine room encased in glass that almost compelled an impulsive spend on a crazy b-day weekend but my wife was able to reel me back in. This was one of those places that made you feel classy but not pretentious. I pretended I was both! Thanks for the experience!  Not so humbly submitted, Michael C."}
{"text":"I have been on a 10 day business trip out west & am finally due to fly home tonight. My husband and I were hoping to avoid the crowd on the strip tonight and saw Palace Station looming in the distance. We decided to stop by to check it out.  The Charcoal Room was nestled inside the casino area and after reading the posted menu I asked if we could dine here. The hostess was prompt and seated us in Reuben's section, leaving a wine list and 2 menus. I was pleasantly surprised at the casual richness of the interior of this steakhouse, we usually dine at the trendy casinos, but this could compete. To be honest our server was extremely attentive and the food bypassed my expectations, my only regret was not being able to eat the entire perfectly seared New York Strip!  I will be in town again in two weeks and I'm already planning which clients to take to dinner with me.  Kudos to the chef and our server, Reuben!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love the food here!! A very reasonable price tag for a nice dinner. The servers are always on point & attentive. The creamed corn is amazing!! They also make an awesome bernaise sauce for your steak."}
{"text":"I am giving them 4 stars because of the excellent service. The food, only 3 stars ...in overall it was good nothing spectacular, the star was definitely the steak. It was great. The steak (bone-in Rib Eye was cooked perfect).....but next time we won't order the mashed potatoes again since we didn't like them, they had a weird texture and flavor. Didn't like the cheesecake either since it was kind of hard and looked like old or like a cheesecake you keep in your refrigerator for 1 week...definitely didn't taste or look fresh or homemade. This was a disappointment since the place is really nice. We will probably come back to give them a second opportunity."}
{"text":"Wonderful, Top-Notch service and the food was amazing.  A hidden gem!  We will return anytime we get to that side of the Valley!"}
{"text":"I don't always get to return to a restaurant I first visited through a Yelp event, but I was so impressed the first time around that I went a few nights ago.  Happy to report that it is as outstanding as the first time, which I hadn't reviewed here.  We don't usually order appetizers and, true to form, we didn't this time.  My husband did order the French onion soup.  Soup always fills me up, so I had just a taste, and it was delicious.  Though I love the stuff, it's usually way too salty for me, but here that wasn't the case.  It had just enough to allow the onion and cheese flavors to shine through.    We both had the petite filet mignon, mine medium-rare, hubby's medium, and each was cooked perfectly, just as we ordered.  The meat was flavorful, tender as a filet should be, and juicy.  The asparagus side we shared was outstanding - crisp-tender in a way that I can never get my own to be, and even though they ranged in thickness, each spear was cooked just right.  We also shared the giant baked potato, and it was giant indeed.  My hallmark for a great baked spud is one that is cooked so well that it doesn't need any butter or sour cream, and this one passed the test.  There was also bacon, cheese and chives brought with the potato to add more taste and calories.  Though we didn't order drinks or dessert, and our check was comparatively small by steakhouse standards (and even smaller, since The Charcoal Room is Strip quality without the Strip prices), the service was as attentive and friendly as possible.    This restaurant is a hidden gem - an excellent and classy restaurant in a downscale casino hotel - that deserves a big following."}
{"text":"My steak was amazing. The filet mingon was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten. It was salty, crusted, juicy, perfectly rare. I also had the spinach salad which was big enough for three people. It was good, but didn't seem very refined for some reason. The asparagus was also very good, but I didn't get the jelly-like (I'm assuming hollandaise) sauce that came with it. Also, it didn't come out very hot.  My wife's halibut was also really big and tasted great but was a little chewy on the outside. Cooking fish like a steak doesn't really work for me. Her brocolini and rice pilaf were both good, but didn't wow me in any way.  The service was very good and all of the staff seemed really nice.   Overall, I would recommend this place just because the meat is superb-but you kinda have to stick to that. Everything else was good, but not great."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!! Happened to be at Palace Station casino watching college football with friends. We decided to go in for a steak dinner. My friends and I are servers on Las Vegas strip and eat out a lot. We were pleasantly surprised with this steakhouse. A beautiful room, with a modern and relaxing atmosphere. Our server Laura was very knowledgeable, nice, helpful and friendly. She recommended the Crab dip and Lobster chowder, they were amazing. For main course she recommended the Filet mignon with Merlot reduction and the NY strip with Blue cheese on top and peppercorn sauce, also some great side dishes ( Mac n cheese, potatoes al gratin, cream corn) absolutely delicious. Laura paired up our steaks with a great Merlot wine. To finish we had the berries cobbler, warm, with vanilla ice cream on top, freaking awesome. Definitely will recommend this restaurant. Thanks Laura for a great time and dinner."}
{"text":"Having been a long-time guest of this restaurant, having gone several times a year for over 10 years, I am finally at my breaking point with this restaurant. Make no mistake, the service and quality of the food is still on par, but the restaurant is now taking advantage of their guests by severely cutting serving sizes and hiking up prices.  For a 33% increase in price, their salad has shrunk 50%. Their steak prices have also jumped 33%in priceand again, shrunk their sizes. The \"large\" filet is their old small, and I do not even want to hazard how small the new small is. I will not be returning to this restaurant any time soon. This is the first time I have left their restaurant hungry, and that is after finishing my wife's crab legs.  Total disappoint. Goodbye Charcoal room."}
{"text":"Amazing steak. Nice and quiet inside. Service was absolutely wonderful. Bring your Station Casino Player's card and be sure to ask about the Player's Club special. It's something different each month. For April 2012 it was $19.99 for the petite filet and shrimp."}
{"text":"To start off with, we had complimentary bread and butter (raisin baguette was pretty good). The breads were really soft and warm. For appetizers, we got the scallop and the calamaris. Scallops were a bit too salty for me but my dad seemed to like it. Calamaries were some of the best I've had, they were perfectly soft and not too fried. The sauce that came with it were also great. For the main course I ordered the petit filet mignon, which was perfectly soft and tender. Dad ordered the sirloin steak, said it was the best steak he had in a long time. He liked sirloin over mine because of the after taste, but I liked the filet mignon better because it was softer. Paired it with red wine and it was delish, but could not finish the steak because they serve a house salad that comes before the steak and I got full of of the bread and the salad and the appetizers lol. For dessert, we tried the cheesecake and the chocolate cake. They were alright but Cheesecake was better. Cake portions were pretty huge, enough to share with 2-3 people.  The waiter was also really attentive and nice and funny, and made the whole experience better. The reason why i give 4 stars though is the waiting time for the food to come out. My brother said he never waited so long for steak before."}
{"text":"We decided that we wanted steak for our anniversary. We were at Santa Fe in January & Charcoal Room was closed, but we still wanted to try it out.  So....this time we made reservations.  We had appetizers of crab cakes & grilled tuna. Soup was next, one was lobster bisque, the other was french onion soup. Katrina had soup & spinach salad. Darrell had scallops & I had a porterhouse steak (rare).  The service was wonderful, Jesus & Ray were so nice.  Overall experience was wonderful.  Also as a gift to us from the waiter, he gave us a slice of chocolate cake! (Darrell's favorite)."}
{"text":"Solid steakhouse, if the menu isn't exactly the same as Austin's at the Texas it's damn close.   I started with the chopped salad, which was good but not quite as good as its cousin at the Texas (could be how they routinely prepare it here, or just the chef who made it).   Entree was the bone-in rib-eye, which was cooked perfectly. I'm picky when it comes to the doneness of my steaks. I asked our waiter how the chef that evening cooked, and was advised to order a little underdone, so I went with rare+. Delightfully, a perfect medium rare arrived. I think if I cared less, just going medium rare would have been satisfactory but it was nice that the server knew what to expect. The cilantro sauce is the tastiest sauce ever, I would have it with every meal. Thank me later. I had the sweet potato as a side...it was a sweet potato.   Service was excellent. In addition to knowing the chef's tendencies, our server was keen on spotting dropped napkins and less than full drinks. Friendly, just the right amount of attention, and knew the restaurant well.   I would definitely come back when I'm in the mood for a good steak, but don't want to break the bank at StripSteak and its ilk (which is more often than not)."}
{"text":"Nice steakhouse in Palace Station. I am staying here for a work conference and received a $20 gift certificate for spending at least $50 when I checked in. Great deal! It is probably one of the only bright spots besides the Oyster Bar in the casino and rarely is it busy. The 10oz filet was good and while I don't drink wine I think they had a decent selection."}
{"text":"The Charcoal Room was wonderful. The food, the staff, and the ambiance was amazing. We had a party of 24 for our rehearsal dinner and the manager accommodated our party without any issues. The steaks were HHUUGGEEE, flavorful, and reasonably priced. Do yourself a favor and don't break the bank with all the other steakhouses.. This is the one!"}
{"text":"The decor, menu and wait staff have been upgraded since its days as The Broiler.  A basket of warm bread was delivered to our table shortly after receiving our menus.  The warm raisin bread being an immediate hit.  My wife chose the Colorado lamb chops, 4 ribs cooked medium rare as requested, that included both a serviceable house salad and baked potato.  I chose the pan seared seabass which was accompanied by sauteed broccoli and salad.  The seabass was generous in size and perfectly grilled, but it would have benefited from a sauce which I neglected to request though a squirt of lemon helped.  The month of May's My Generation specials included paying with  1/2 points at all steakhouses so color me happy."}
{"text":"In the early evening we headed off for the 5-7PM daily happy hour at the Charcoal Room in Santa Fe Station for some $5 martinis.  On the first round, there would be a second; my wife ordered a lemon drop while I went with a roasted, toasted almond (Sky vodka, Amaretto and Starbucks liqueur).  Hers was good, but mine was better.    We noticed, especially me since I kept my eyes glued on our (very) attractive bartender, that she was not using a shot glass and each pour seemed to be very long.  As I was finishing my martini, I picked up the shaker and began pouring and pouring.  Damned if there wasn't a 2nd martini in each of our shakers.          We decided to toss sobriety to the wind and ordered a 2nd round or would it be considered a 3rd?  This time we both settled on mochatinis (Starbucks liqueur, Absolute vanilla vodka and dark crème de cacao).    The equivalent of 8 martinis for $20 represents was an amazing value."}
{"text":"There is a distinct odor cooked meat gives off after being defrosted in a microwave. A good commercial kitchen would not have, and a proper chef would not use a microwave. Why, I have to ask myself would my generous perfectly sliced piece of roast have that odor?  While the ambiance and service pay contempory  homage to Las Vegas of the past, if you are expecting food and ambiance on par with The Golden Steer, you'll be sorely disappointed. Actually, if good prime rib is what you desire wait until it is on the Palace Station Buffet. I believe it is fresher and tastier. A decent salad is served with the entree although it came with a lot of the core or stems of the lettuce leaves that one would think a restaurant trying to be a step up would want to use for the stock pot, if there actually is one in this kitchen.  I don't particularly care for extremely hot food so when I cut into the baked potato and it didn't steam I wasn't too concerned. My companion sent his back, pointing out it was old. I found it odd it had not been rubbed in butter or oil before baking. It did appear to have been washed though.  If you crave tough, rubbery Calamari be sure to order the appetizer. It is served with sliced peppers which are very flavorful."}
{"text":"I went out with my mother for Mother's Day we ordered two salads with a T-Bone Steak, King Crab Legs & a side of broccoli . After eating most of the salad I found a HUGE fly in it....It was a horror show -  So the manager came out belittling me & pointing his finger explaining he would take care of the salad. Fine. then he made the excuse of saying, \"well we do buy organic greens so sometimes they have more insects and although we *try* to wash it, occasionally they do slip through\". I just don't think that is a reasonable excuse for finding a huge insect in your food!!  Would you have been satisified with this? It wasnt acceptable, I was a bit put off by the excuse he gave   Long story short, we were treated like garbage over something we had no control over... I can not wait for Donny (Food & Beverage Manager)  to return my voicemail.  Derek the manager acted unprofessional & should not have acted  this way in front of other guest!!!! No one should feel like this on Mother's Day"}
{"text":"I was on a work assignment and used Yelp to find this restaurant in the middle of unknown territory.  Casino restaurants are not my favorite places to eat solely because I don't like smelling cigarette smoke, when I eat.  The good thing about The Charcoal Room is it's enclosed in glass doors that block out the cigarette smell.  The muted lighting and decor give the setting a classic look.  Our server, Billy, is right up there with the best of them.  He is polished and pleasant!  For example, when my restaurant companion went to the restroom, Billy stopped by the table to fold his napkin.  I ordered a wedge salad and he didn't scoff at me for asking the kitchen to chop the salad.    What I love about the menu is that it's not contrived, it's SOLID.  The restaurant doesn't need to use fancy names or highbrow ingredients.  The Charcoal Room has simply amazing food combinations that instantly stir your taste buds.  In fact, the menu has so many incredible staples it's hard to choose a dish.  I went with the blackened salmon.  The vegetables are a la carte.  I ordered the broccoli cooked medium.    Everything was presented and flavored to PERFECTION!  The portions are quite hearty.  I had to get a to-go container and didn't have enough room for dessert.  When you visit The Charcoal Room, bring a robust appetite and anticipate that all of your fine dining senses will be satisfied."}
{"text":"Very impressed by the quality of the service, food, atmosphere and selection of wine. I will definitely be returning to this place and referring my friends. I must recommend the rib eye sautéed, absolutely the best steak I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with good pricing (for a higher end restaurant). I've been coming here for about 8 years in and off again, and each time the food was amazing. Service is good. Every time I come I get the filet mignon and every time it's been perfectly cooked, the steak is so tender and juicy and well worth the price tag."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and  everything came out on time.  We had dinner on New Year Eve they had music it was perfect. The reason I gave four stars because the waitress didn't seem to be too happy. We enjoyed our dinner. The steaks were delicious."}
{"text":"Very nice decor, service was excellent, from appetizers to aged rib eye everything was fantastic..."}
{"text":"An excellent steakhouse. My wife loves the Atlantic Salmon Blackened. I love the bone in Ribeye pan seared. Add a lobster Tail. We have enjoyed on different occasions sides of creamed corn, asparagus, sautéed mushrooms, green beans, and creamed spinach. Appetizers: Jumbo Shrimp, Coconut Shrimp All of the salads and breads are also excellent. The service has always been spot on. We've never had to wait very long for a table. Very nice atmosphere. Prices are a little bit expensive but worth it. My leftovers the next day are like another meal again. We've been there about 9 times over the last 3 years and have never once been disappointed. The Charcoal Room is a definite must visit on your bucket list."}
{"text":"Service was super slow, food was still good. It was my birthday dinner with my family and friends. last year were much better than this time around."}
{"text":"I cannot really comment on the food because I never received my order. I tried to order on Postmates and as the time got closer to delivery I received a text saying my order was cancelled. Not very happy"}
{"text":"We have never had a bad meal here. Our steaks were cooked perfectly. We were there celebrating a birthday and the staff made it feel special. We eat at The Charcoal Room at least once a month and we would recommend it to anyone! Great food and perfect service!"}
{"text":"We went back about a month or so ago and my wife noticed that the steaks taste a bit different.  She found out from staff that they no longer grill the meat with charcoal, thus losing the flavor of the \"Charcoal Room\".  Still okay, but not the same.  Hopefully if they get enough feedback they might change back."}
{"text":"We went on a date night here. I had the seared pan fried scallops and calamari...they were awesome...also a nice glass of jacobs creek white aussie wine. Service was awesome"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our entire dining experience. Very slow and inattentive service. Worse my king crab legs were cold and my wife's pork loin was overlooked and dry. When we complained to the manager he gave us a very bad attitude to the point that I refused to eat the food he supposedly reheated. None the less he presented us with the bill in full. I paid it but I will never stay or eat in a Station property again."}
{"text":"The best steaks, prime rib, scallops and sea bass.  This place was worth the money and wasn't terribly expensive.  I'd be back again, for sure.  The best meal in vegas I've ever had, seriously, get here!"}
{"text":"My husband & I have enjoyed A+ service and Petit Filets for years at the Charcoal Room.  While the service is still fabulous, the Petit Filet was NOT.  It was smaller, more expensive, and not even close to the Petit we have enjoyed in the past."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing the first few months. Mouthwatering.  Since then though, it's not as amazing.  Slower service, the food is not horrible but definitely not worth the price you're paying any more (it absolutely was the first few months).  For the price point I expect much more than I get here.    In a pinch it's not bad food, it's just not the quality I expect for the price."}
{"text":"(Santa fe station location!) So disappointed! We had such high expectations for this place! First off, the service was absolutely horrible. Our server checked on his other tables 5-6x. He checked on us 1x. We had to ask the manager for refills on our drinks and also for the check! The white wine sauce on the chicken was not reduced enough so it tasted like creamy white wine (yuck). The filet was full if fat and the mashed potatoes were severely lacking seasoning. Not in any shape or form what you would expect from 150$ dinner! Still angry I paid that much! Will never be back"}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked medium rare filet and flaky tender pan seared salmon. Very good service. Overall an excellent meal for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Las vegas!Freshest seafood and prices are really inexpensive!Tried lobster tail which was huge and scallops!The best seafood I've ever tried and I've been to all high end restaurants in Vegas! Really happy I found this place."}
{"text":"You know.. I really really like the happy hour. But when the Manager George comes over and says that we are saying cuss words and taking too loud, it is very offensive. In fact, he said our guests here don't like it. Sorry but, are we not guests as well?  We come pretty much every week and are guests. We are professional people, lawyers, doctors, etc. We dress nice, spend a lot of money and tip well. Maybe one cuss word came out in passing from a friend, but geeze sometimes that happens when you sit at a bar and have drinks with friends.   I spoke to the manager about it who was very smug and said that other guests were not being as loud and wanted to enjoy their dinner without noise. I'm sorry, but you have a bar. If you sit next to a bar there is going to be loud noise. It was more in the manner the manager said it. He could have just politely asked us to keep the volume down, offered to move us somewhere more secluded or just been a descent human being. I am very disappointed and will probably not come back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Fantastic steaks, amazing augratin potatoes, delicious French onion soup! They also have fantastic chopped Salads. Service is impeccable and the staff is friendly yet professional. Lovely ambiance.   We are locals and right by Red Rock Casino (also owned by Station Casinos) but make the 20 min drive to Santa Fe Station. It's the same food as T Bones Chop House but half the price!!  We dine here weekly and our favorite servers  are Diane and Misa (pronounced Misha)"}
{"text":"This is the diamond in the rough. Off the strip yet some of the best steak I've ever had. Service was fantastic. Food was superb. Wine was a little pricy as was the food but I'm sure way cheaper than the strip. If your looking for a nice higher end steak place with great service and I suppose reasonable Vegas prices stop here."}
{"text":"Charcoal Room at Santa Fe Station  A popular restaurant for locals - famous for its heavenly filet mignon & lobster. BUT, the service should be better!  The Yelpy Version: - One early evening in late March, our friends treated my wife and myself to an incredible dinner at this nice, popular restaurant inside Santa Fe Station Casino. We all had its famous \"Wed Special\" of \"Lobster/Filet Mignon ($30) Combo\". We were all absolutely delighted with the food and wine! The lobster tasted fresh and joicy, and the filet mignon absolutely heavenly - melting in your mouth with delicious flavors! We also had their Marinated Shrimps (actually large prawns!) apetizer, which was very tasty! Our friends ordered a bottle of Cabinet Sauvignon theyliked but it was sold out. Our nice server offered us a $65/bottle of an alternative brand for $35, and it was rich, smooth and flavorful! Great!  The Charcoal Room has a \"medium-high-end\" type of decor, but gives a casual, inviting ambience. It has a huge, beautiful sports bar, which offered $5 Happy Hour drinks and was completely full around 5:30pm.At our departure around 7:30pm, the restaurant was almost completely full.  The serving staff that evening was probably overwhelmed by the large dinner crowd. The service was good at the beginning, but the follow up service was SUB-Par, when it got busier. It was difficult to get server's attention even to order coffee and desert;harder still to get refills for coffee and water!  ADDITIONAL comments for management's kind consideration. - Even though the food, drinks were superb and the ambience was great, BUT... 1. PLEASE do TRAIN ALL servers to be ATTENTIVE to ALL tables, even those not assigned to them. - It'd be nice if a server would acknowledge a guest, raising his/her hand trying hard to get attention! Please letthe guest know that his/herserver is busy at the moment but will be notified to come over. - As one knows, \"Psychologically, a customer is MOST ANNOYED and UNHAPPY if he feels being IGNORED by a server\"!  2. During our meal, the manager was nice enough to come over for a quick chat, which made us all feel welcome, BUT incredibly, this same manager just ignored us when we were getting out of the restaurant door, where he was standing nearby! At departure, we were asking the hostess about the Happy Hour specials. Thehostess aparently did not know the details. This manager standing nearby was talking to another staff member; he could hear us but chose to just ignore us! - He did NOT even try to help out the poor hostess in answering our important question, nor did he take the opportunity to say goodbye to us. To us, this was NOT good to leave customers with such an unsatisfying \"Parting Impression\"! Whatever browny points he had earned by coming over to our table earlier to chat were completely lost when he ignored us, while standing near us, at our departure!  Peterskis, Apr 2012"}
{"text":"This is the type of restaurant that people call a hidden little gem. It's off the strip in Palace Station, you walk inside the casino and you aren't getting an opulent gaming floor, and you walk by a smoky bar and there it is. The Charcoal Room is behind two heavy glass doors, and a wine sculpture, which blocks out the noises and lights from the slots.  They cook great steaks and seafood in classic steakhouse presentation with choices of French sauces or crust add-ons. I'm not a dessert person, but I was able to note how beautifully they are presented.  They make a decent supper club old fashioned and I enjoyed my large gin martini.  For dinner I had the rare New York steak with peppercorn sauce and sautéed mushrooms. The steak has a flavorful rub. My dining companion had the surf and turf special with a filet mignon and perfectly cooked shrimp and lobster tail.  My only point of criticism was some slight inconsistency in the rareness of the steaks. Otherwise I would highly recommend this place and would be happy to come again."}
{"text":"Oct 13, 2017: This was a special dinner - a birthday and was greatly disappointing. Quality control suffers greatly.  The chef has been screwing with a long successful menu with items that are basically \"CRAP\"  Cream Corn is gone - replaced by a crappy version of Mexican Street Corn. It was bland, completely unseasoned and inedible.  Scallops: They were RAW when served to us How did they get out of the kitchen? The REDO was OK, but this should never been have happened. It should have been caught before being served. AND no IDIOT puts \"green peas\" on a scallop DISH - NO ONE! UGLY, INEDIBLE, BURNED and DRY! - No sauce for the scallops either. A complete failure!   Pretzel Bread: We were serve two sticks, but no refills - THE KITCHEN RAN OUT (at 7:30 pm)  - they said \"will have to cook some more.\"  WTF!  Out Lobster and Filet were fine, but the incompetence of the kitchen with veggies, pretzel bread, raw scallops  and then the pea crap on the scallops RUINED an otherwise good meal.  Our server, Kevin, was PERFECT in every way and did all in his power to help us! We commend him greatly!  Please fix this before the Chef brings this restaurant DOWN!  BTW, just wondered, how does a $$$$ restaurant get by with only ONE rest room? WHY?"}
{"text":"8 July 2014:  Simply put, absolutely fantastic! We had lobster and filet. Quality was spot-on!  Food is always perfectly cooked and seasoned, portions generous and delicious.  This has become my regular fine dining restaurant, no need to drive to the strip or anywhere when I have perfection a mile from home.  Service? Outstanding!  Kevin is the best waiter anywhere, and I always reserve seating in his section.  Summary: perfect dining experience always - for almost a year! Wonderful."}
{"text":"I would've never came here if it wasn't for restaurant week.  I'm glad they participated. I found this hidden gem in Santa Fe casino.  The staff was extremely helpful and very attentive to my needs we didn't know what sauce to try with the steak so the got us all of the sauces the have.  The side dishes very pleasant. My favorite was the Yukon mash potatoes. We will be coming here more often since it's near centennial hills."}
{"text":"I used to eat here a lot because it was close to to where I live. The service was and is excellent and the atmosphere was and is perfect. I get the same thing every time: The Charcoal Room Chopped Salad: Perhaps one of the best salads I've ever had. I was in the mood for the the lobster mac-'n'-cheese: Which was fine. But, then came the t-bone steak, and this is what took away three stars - It used to be great, but the quality of the meat recently has diminished substantially. I've got the stomach of a billy goat. There is nothing on this planet, that I can't eat. And I've never not finished a plate of food that's been put in front of me... Until I got that t-bone. When the waiter came over to ask how everything was, I told him to take a seat at the table, and proceeded to give him a 2-minute lecture about how I could have spent $5 at Von's and got a better piece of meat than what they were charging me $45 for. I read some of the other recent reviews, and I scratch my head. Is there another Charcoal Room at the Santa Fe that I'm missing? To each his own, I guess. Anyway, steak is my thing (I eat 4-5 steaks per week), and this place just doesn't cut the mustard anymore. Sorry."}
{"text":"Came here with my fam for Thanksgiving dinner, and we loved it! I ordered the pan-seared bone-in ribeye and really liked it! Other steaks on the table included New York Steak, Surf & Turf, Lamb chops, and Porterhouse; had a taste of all of them and really liked the way they cooked all of them. We jointly ordered the calamari appetizier and sides of asparagus, sauteed mushrooms, and baked sweet potato, and they were all fabulous. While the server wasn't quite knowledgeable in the details of certain steak preparation (my curiosity), he gave great recommendations and was extremely helpful throughout the entire dinner. My family was extremely satisfied with this choice of steakhouse!"}
{"text":"We had a bunch of points to use so we decided to try this steak house. The Charcoal Room was a pleasant surprise. The service was great and we sat in a nice comfortable booth. I think the prices were decent for the quality of the entree.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner for four. Our daughter had the roasted chicken, her boyfriend had the strip steak, the husband had the strip steak and I had the king cut prime rib. The prime rib was charred nicely on the outside and was a perfect shade of rare with horseradish on the side. Sides were the au gratin potatoes which were the best au gratin potatoes my husband has ever had. The creamed corn had diced pieces of poblano peppers and was very flavorful.  Tried the chocolate banana martini which was fantastic but for some reason had a salted rim, not a fan. The daughter tried the melon martini and tasted a bit like an alcohol version of ecto cooler from kool aid, this is good.   Our server was attentive and brought out a chocolate cake for our daughter's 22nd birthday. Great selection of wines and I finished with the turtle cheesecake and a tawny port for the night. Santa Fe did send me a $25 coupon for the Charcoal Room and it was much appreciated.   The chef stopped by our table to inquire about the daughter not eating most of her chicken and she was just too full from our appetizers and the bread basket. The pretzel bread in the bread basket is awesome. Try to save room from dinner. I ate at least half of the pretzel bread and was fighting over it with the daughter.  And appetizers the oysters on the half shell are nice sized, great amount of fresh horseradish and fresh as can be. The seared ahi tuna with wasabi cream is tasty and nicely presented. We will be returning shortly. This restaurant has great steaks and seafood."}
{"text":"Came for date night last month, left the kids at kid quest which is very convenient.Our server was an older gentleman who was very knowledgeable on wine so we had a white one he recommended and a delicious Margarita. The scallop appetizer was incredible! The side portion sizes are awesome plan on sharing! Regardless of the cut of meat u get, have it with the peppercorn sauce, ITS HEAVENLY! Took the creme brûlée for dessert and ate it in the car because its a formal restaurant and it was so delicious i would have been dancing on the table had I stayed."}
{"text":"This steak house is the Best Deal in the Las Vegas Valley.  A 16ox. NY steak with a salad and potato is $28.00 The Steak house at Circus Circus is for the same thing is $66.00.  The food, service, and decor is excellent.  The prices for dinners are a bargain.. Shrimp Scampi, and other dishes  such as  Lamb Chops or about $20-23.00.A 20oz. bone in rib Steak about $40. Have fun and enjoy this  nice place."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate our anniversary.  We wanted to have a good meal and we didn't want to have to travel far.  This place was perfect for all of the above.    At the table there is a basket of assorted breads.  I think there were 3 or 4 different types.  I'm a bread whore loving any starchy products so this was a very nice surprise.  With the bread was softened butter.   This really is key when serving bread, cold butter just doesn't work.    We also had a couple of drinks.  I always have to try the lemon drop martini.  This one was wonderful.  Fresh lemon juice and the right amount of sugar.  Fresh lemons are key, I can always tell when it isn't .    We started with a crab cake appetizer ($12).  It came with 2 nicely-sized cakes.  They were nice and crisp on the outside and completely filled with juicy lump crab on the inside.  I love crab, but a good crab cake is hard to find.  This one was one of the best I've tasted.  It didn't come with any fancy sauces (didn't need ANYTHING extra) because it was just simple and great.  Very light on the breading and heavy on the crab, the way it should be.  We next split a Caesar Salad ($7).  It was good, nothing really spectacular.  It did come with 3 cheese-baked bread slices.  Then the main meal, our 24oz. porterhouse steak ($32) with sides of baked potato, baked sweet potato, and asparagus with a side of hollandaise (all $6 each).  The steak was cooked perfectly, tons of flavor needing to add nothing to it.  The sides were as you would expect them to be, nothing real extraordinary but how can you mess-up a baked potato?  One of the things that I enjoyed most was the way they split everything.  The runner brings the food fully plated to the table with 2 extra plates and splits it in front of us, instead of the back.  Even the steak, he cut each in half (fillet side and New York side) and put them on our plates for us.  This was so great!  It just shows the class of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. The avocado salad is amazing. The steaks are cooked perfectly. We always enjoy a nice dinner here. The casino however, is not that great."}
{"text":"Yuck  where do I begin, worst experience EVER!!! Ordered the oysters those were delicious however the seared scallops were terrible I had to spit the 1 bite I took in the napkin and wasn't brought a replacement so I took it off the next table, the lobster that came with the \"surf n turf\" was also completely in edible and the steak was undercooked. It took an HOUR just to bring our soup that looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp the whole time, they never brought our salads. The Mgr came to our table trying to apologize saying he would \"see what he could do\" and when the bill came we were charged for the wine which actually was delicious by the way the oysters and the soup totaling over $50!!! Way to \"see what you can do\"!! After all that and they still charged us I will NEVER eat here again and if you do, I HIGHLY recommend NOT to eat ANY seafood!!!"}
{"text":"Five stars up!!  We decided to try this steak house because they had a My Vegas gift certificate.  We arrived 10 minutes before the restaurant opened so we walked around.  The restaurant opened right at 5pm.  We were seated at a table and promptly served.  During our visit we order the King Cut Prime Rib, with mashed potatoes, and a sweet potato.  Our steaks were cooked to perfection.  Normally, a type of sauce is required when having a steak however our steaks did not require such.  The au ju sauce that accompanied the steak was amazing.  Overall, this is a hidden jewel in Las Vegas and a top steak house one must try."}
{"text":"Had an awesome dinner tonight. Started with their steakhouse chopped salad, the Surf and Turf and a side of lobster macaroni and cheese. All were incredible! Had a couple bottles of Silver Oak cab to go with it. The night couldn't have been more perfect for our 36th wedding anniversary!!"}
{"text":"This town has a variety of all kinds of dining styles. The Charcoal Room is more than substantial and durable. The menu has just the right amount of choices and it's not one of those imposing 'book' menus.  The first dish to arrive was the scallops as an appetizer. The depths of these bay scallops were perfectly cooked. Next up- the entree which was in a pool of delicious drippings. As a friend and myself dined at the bar we had the pleasure of Carrie being our server.  Carrie is not your amateurish bartender, she's poised and makes that connection in knowing you and your preferences. I informed her  to surprise us with a dessert- perfection! That chocolate cake is scrumptious, BUT what had me was the rock candy.  Yes, rock candy along with my espresso. I will return for that!  Well, The Charcoal Room's food and service as well;)"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times and always had a good experience.  It was so different when we had dinner there on Tuesday June 5th arriving at around 7:00pm and sat at the bar.  It took awhile to get waited on and after getting our drinks we discovered that the bartender was a temporary and did not know the menu and she was not the only new or temporary staff working that night.  We were disappointed that they no longer offered the 28 day aged top sirloin.  So, we ordered the prime rib between rare and medium or rare plus.  After a long wait a staffer brought out our entire order with the salad.  It was obvious he had not been trained to bring the salad first and then follow with the entre.  The prime rib came out well done and we sent it back.  Again after a wait we were told that the kitchen only had well done left, so we ordered a different entre.  Unusual since this was fairly early in the evening and they were not busy.  After dinner we asked for our bill.  I had to remind the bartender a second time that we wanted our bill.  Finally she brought it, but the itemized bill was not included.  We asked for the itemized copy, but se did not know how to recover it and after again a long wait we left without it.  With all the inaccuracies we were concerned that the bill was not correct.  We will try one more time, but if service is this poor and untrained we will not come back."}
{"text":"Just had delicious prime rib, delicious filet and delicious chopped salad at the Charcoal Room in the Santa Fe.  What really topped off the meal was the outstanding services by our server, Jesus.  He has a pleasant personality, doesn't bother you when you are eating, and even fixed a little error on our dinner with ease.  Can't wait to go back and we will be sure to ask for Jesus!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I had the chopped salad, boneless NY steak, medium cooked, potatoes au gratin and asparagus for sides, and creme brûlée for dessert. Everything was plenty enough to share. My review is one down from a perfect star because I could smell cigarette smoke when we were eating and our table was in the back half of the restaurant. It was also a bit of a walk from the covered garage, so I had to walk through the smokey casino to get there."}
{"text":"We  had heard nothing but fine reports (incl. on Yelp) about the steakhouse called the Charcoal room at Palace Station, so gave it a try  last evening, arriving at 5:30 to a surprisingly large group of diners at that early hour.  It is a sizeable & lovely room with subdued lighting, many booths to be had, and enough friendly faces to greet us.  I ordered giant crab legs ($28) and my partner the Top Sirloin ($24).  We were promptly asked for our drink order & served a big basket of 4 kinds of breads, incl. a delicious sourdough & terrific walnut/raisin.  Then came substantial salads & we were happy with their ranch & bleu cheese.  But everything was over-shadowed by what followed:  Our server brought a little hot pot of butter & soon one pound of crab legs which were bigger than I've had in an order, & just as succulent.   Even the sautéed broccoli accompaniment was terrific.  My partner & I are not lovers of red meat, but the expression on his face made me realize he could convert real soon.  The Top Sirloin was beautiful on that plate & served  \"medium rare\" as ordered.  I had a taste & it melted in my mouth (oh, the memories of the days back in the Midwest where I often feasted at Chicago's Stockyards on prime rib).  The mashed potatoes weren't ordinary either (but a bit heavy on the salt).  Our server, Alexis, was a sweet young woman & most attentive.  And midway into the meal the maître'd   arrived to inquire how the meal was so far.  \"Divine\" said I.  [To add to our experience:  The Charcoal Room has its own restrooms, unusual in most casino restaurants].  BON APPETIT !"}
{"text":"Charcoal Room is a little oasis in a smoke filled Vegas locals casino. We all enjoyed our meal here. First off..Kevin, our server. He's almost too attentive but he's very good and enhances the dining experience.  cocktails are first rate. my Manhattan was excellent. The pretzel rolls  are out of this world delicious..melt in your mouth. wanted to sneak a few home in my wife's pocketbook. Wife and I thought our Caesar salad was just Ok...croutons were a little off/dry? my son loved his crabcakes appetizer. My prime rib entree was very good....tender and cooked just right. my son enjoyed his filet.....I thought my wife's filet was a little undercooked but she liked it and said it was tasty. we shared decent au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach. We all shared a single creme brulee for dessert and gave it a high grade. This is a quiet,comfortable restaurant.....no loud blaring music. it isn't hip...its a reasonably priced very good steakhouse."}
{"text":"On August 8, 2017, my husband and I decided to celebrate our Anniversary at the Charcoal Room Restaurant.  Well, that was a huge mistake! The food was awful, terrible service and the ambience has a lot to be desired!  We believed that we would have received excellent service, wonderful food and a beautiful ambience due to the fact it was a station casino just like Green Valley Ranch Casino!  Green Valley Ranch is were we had celebrated our previous year anniversary which was at Hank's Fine Steaks Restaurant!  At Hank's Fine Steaks Restaurant, the food was delicious, the service was superb and the ambience was beautiful and relaxing!  Whereas, the Charcoal Room Restaurant is totally the opposite of the spectrum!  In fact, I should have tipped the waitress $1 or better yet, one penny! She definitely did NOT deserve my hard-earned money!!!  It was the WORST dinner we have ever had!  My husband ended up in the restroom the majority of the night and I ended up throwing up my dinner!  So, if you decide to eat there, do not say that i did not WARNED you!  Station Casino should close the doors of this Charcoal Room Restaurant and place a better quality restaurant in its place!!!"}
{"text":"Hands-down the best steakhouse I've been to in recent memory. Definitely better than the chain steakhouses such as Ruth's Chris and Morton's. I came here through recommendations from my parents, who found this place last year and have been raving about their high quality food since last year.   First of all, the bone-in rib eye steak was amazing. The flavor was perfect and not too salty and it was cooked very evenly. The baked potato that came with the steak was also very good (for a baked potato). Even the salad before the entree was pretty good!  During the course of our dinner, I also had a chance to try my girlfriend's pan seared scallops and those were also really good.   Overall, even though this restaurant is off the main Strip area, I definitely recommend taking a short trip to Palace Station to eat at this excellent steakhouse!"}
{"text":"What a lovely surprise!  We ended up here with the intention of eating at the oyster bar and ended up at The Charcoal Room. This will now be a destination when we go to Las Vegas.  Our waitress Laura could not have been better very attentive and HONEST as to what to order and what not to order. I had a dozen very fresh and tasty oysters for $22, I've known to pay that for a half a dozen at home. My ribeye was perfectly cooked (rare) and my wife's filet as well (well done). Lobster Mac n Cleese  was very cheesy with lobster flavor throughout.  Carey the bartender made sure that Mary and I had drinks to our liking even came up with something on the fly for Mary.  I love this place and will be back and back and back....."}
{"text":"This place is the Bomb.  Great Service and Awesome Food. Mr. Delacruz (GM) is a class act. He knows how to take care of his guest."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and great food. Good selection of beer and wine and the steaks are incredibly delicious. I always have the filet 8 oz and it never ever disappoints me. You gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My wife and I have been here several times and have never been disappointed. We always go to the Santa Fe station which has easy parking and access.   I believe this location provides you a great steak house experience at a reasonable costs. For example, my wife and I can share a meal and leave full. The steaks are always good, well cooked to your liking. The seafood is always great. The variety of food is great without being very overwhelming.   The staff takes great care of their guests (Diane is awesome). As more of a locals location, you generally get remembered and you will get stuff before you ask. Just a great personal service.   In conclusion, if your looking for a great steakhouse experience, give the Charcoal Room a try."}
{"text":"My daughter and I didn't make a reservation and when we arrived Wednesday night at 6, the restaurant was half empty but we were told nothing was available until 7:30, so we had to eat at the bar.  All through dinner it never got busy.  We left after 8!    The dinner was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed our bartender.  I only wish the front was friendlier and improve their seating"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant with very reasonable prices and nice atmosphere. LOVED it and had great service and food.  Favorites were the crab cakes, chopped salad and carrot cake. Wine by the glass was reasonably priced as well with Kendal Jackson at $9/glass and delicious salty bread to boot. Would definitely go here and you could go a little more casual than other upper end steakhouses but still nice enough to get dressed up if you are in the mood. Loved the round booths in both the bar and dining room."}
{"text":"Great and super outstanding service. This is a perfect example of a quality restaurant should be. I will always come here when I visit las vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place. We had the chopped salad rib eye and salmon. Everything was perfect. It's a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"The Charcoal Room at Santa Fe Station: Cutting to the Chase    The pretzel bread sticks are fabulous, arriving at the table piping hot, soft and salty.  I ate the two that were in the bread basket.    None for my boyfriend.  There was other bread in the basket, though.   The Caesar salad is good, with small pieces of crusty bread as the crouton-like accompaniments.  A generous helping, I didn't finish it because I wanted to leave room for the main course.   The half roasted chicken is tasty.  I ate the breast and took the leg/thigh home.  That sounds a little strange.   The baked sweet potato is huge!  Regular butter and cinnamon butter are provided; put them on the spud, watch them melt, and consume. I ate half there and took the other half home, too.   This is a great place for date night, which we had the night we went.   The service is attentive. The manager came by our table and checked on us.   Sunday night was so steady for them that there were no booths available, so we were seated at a round table that sat four.  I always prefer booths unless with a large group of friends. Not that we are the type of couple to sit side by side in a booth when it's just us, because that's weird, but I didn't feel like waiting. Reservations are suggested just in case, which we had.     Caesar salad+ lobster corn chowder + half chicken + petit filet mignon + sweet potato + asparagus + sauteed mushrooms = $85.00   We were very full when we left with our doggie bag.   The end."}
{"text":"Great food.  Reslly worth it and im a food snob!!!Waiter made the meal taste even better. Thanks you Mario"}
{"text":"They did a wonderful job for Thanksgiving Everything was delicious. The staff were friendly and the presentation of the food was pretty. The best part was that it was not a fixed menu. I was able to substitute a food that I like for a food that I don't eat."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a seafood connoisseur's dream. The lobster tail was one of the best I've ever eaten. It was big, juicy, and delicious. The service was solid and the atmosphere was classy."}
{"text":"This place was ok. I had the Prime rib, and was served cold. The asparagus was also just ok; and I wouldn't really recommend this place. I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The place is nice. Nice first time date environment. The staff were cool, alert, responsive, and knowledgeable about their menu. The Roasted chicken was great, good flavors. We also enjoyed the grilled pork chop , which by the way it was excellent! Crispy outside and moist inside. The bad thing was the sides were like garnishes instead of sides. Very few potatoes with the chicken and the pork chop had asparagus pieces. There are several options on the menu, pick one, I'm sure you will enjoy something too! Go Get  SOME!"}
{"text":"My a teak was done just right, side dishes were generously proportioned. Waitstaff was courteous and attentive. Mac and cheese is fantastic, just the right amount of tang. My friend got the buttermilk chicken and loved it as well... large piece and no bones."}
{"text":"Just ate here, was maybe my third or fourth visit overall.  In total it is a nice play but I agree with some of the other comments.  The tables are too close together, the pretzel bread is great, and the steak is good and tender.  Although, mine arrive \"warm,\" and I usually prefer it more \"hot.\"  Anyway my biggest BEEF with this steak place is this:  They have a happy hour but when sitting for dinner, I am told \"this is only at the bar.\"  Which is...ten feet from my table.  So what is it, I should in a blazing moment of cheap glory rise from my seat, walk to the bar and order drinks there where they are basically half off?  Or I can order from my waitress and pay full price.  I just think this is so absurd.  For a somewhat expensive place you'd think they could do you the courtesy of pricing the drinks the same at your table vs. the bar.  SPECIAL 2015 UPDATE!!  I've eaten here twice in the last couple months including today and I dare say it was the best time I have had there yet.  I had the New York bone-in steak and it was one of the best steaks I've had anywhere.  Great service also.  I would still very much recommend this place and I still eat there as well."}

{"text":"Visited here on Thursday 9-22-16 at 5:15 PM.  This restaurant is located inside Palace Station Casino.  Plan on spending $100 per person if you want to have a good dinner here.    The ambiance is kinda dark and swanky but not too stuffy.  It would be really good for a special occasion or a business dinner.    I just loved our waiter! Gary was so attentive but not over-bearing but at the same time laid back and friendly.  I wish every waiter could be like Gary honestly.  $8 classic caesar salad- Fresh, cold romaine dressed with a house-made caesar dressing and garnished with a nice french bread crouton.  The dressing was nicely fishy so I'm betting they use real anchovies.  It was a tad over-dressed but still really good.  I really liked the shaved grana padano cheese on top.   $12 jumbo shrimp cocktail- Came with 4 huge shrimp in a lovely metal container with delicious horseradish cocktail sauce.  They were very fresh and delicious and I highly recommend this appetizer.   $11 Fried calamari- Had  really good mix of tentacles and rings and was fried perfectly.  Batter did not fall off the calamari, even when dipped into the tasty tomato sauce.  I loved the addition of the cherry peppers on top.  If you like calamari, you'll be pleased with this appetizer.    $28 petite filet- Very good and tender cut of meat.  Perfectly cooked to medium and seasoned very well.  At least 2 inches thick and I enjoyed every bite.  I took half home with me and it was even good warmed up in the microwave.    $32 Lobster tail- Probably one of the biggest lobster tails I've ever eaten.  It was so moist and juicy and had a lovely grilled flavor.  It was served with a nice wedge of lemon and drawn butter.  Probably one of the best lobster tails I've ever eaten.    The sides and desserts were all amazing as well...I won't bore you with all that tho.  I had the loaded baked potato, asparagus, and creme brulee for dessert.  All were nothing short of spectacular.    Don't hesitate to come here if you get the chance."}
{"text":"I split tonight's special, intended for two, between three of us and the quantity was perfect. The lobster was excellent as was the fillet."}
{"text":"The service is impeccable! The food incredible, and we never miss a chance to spend a quiet relaxing evening surrounded by the awesome staff at The Charcoal Room. One of our favorite spots!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here often within the last month or so.  I have had every steak on the menu,  and not one time has it been less than perfect!!  The 20oz Ribeye was spectacular!!The chopped salad is amazing, jumbo shrimp cocktail is incredible!  If you are unsure about anything ask Frank, he knows what he is talking about.  Great guest service, always willing to give his expert advice.   The staff in general is well prepared and very knowledgable on all items on the menu, and some that aren't.  The desserts are amazing....I recommend the Berry Cobbler with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  If you are looking for a fine dining out of this world experience.....you found it.   A food coma awaits you.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"We have been \"regulars\" for the last 8'years and have never been disappointed.  From the hostesses to our server, Anthony, we have always been pleased. The food is great and the service exceptional.  We look forward to being \"regulars\" for many years to come."}
{"text":"This place was spectacular!  Glad we came here. The food was delicious. (With the exception of my mash potatoes) they were good, but not amazing. The waiter and waiter-assistant were amazing. (Anthony & Gin) Very fast and pleasant service, got our drinks in time, answered questions briefly and overall very nice! Will definitely be in again!"}
{"text":"What a find!! Ate here with friends 9-26-17. I had the special- 6oz filet, lobster tail, 2 grilled shrimp.  It included a lovely salad,a great bread basket, mashed potatoes & vegetable. Steak was perfect. My husband had the NY steak cooked to perfection. Other dishes ordered were roast chicken & the salmon entree. Also, the shrimp cocktail that one ordered was amazing. Creme brûlée was yummy. Joseph was a great waiter. We were staying in hotel for a convention & many others ate here & raved about their dinners.I will return!!"}
{"text":"My bf took me here for my birthday. He had the porterhouse and I had the bone in ribeye. Make sure you get the garlic cilantro sauce. It is not to be believed. Amazing. The scallops, mashed potatoes and asparagus were done to perfection. The service was great. They brought out a giant piece of carrot cake when they found out was my birthday. It's was so great. They really made my whole evening perfect."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to the Charcoal Room for year's.  Whether it is appetizers and a glass of wine at the bar or a full dining experience at a booth or table; the food and service has always been exceptional. We are heading over again tonight and am looking forward to a bone in ribeye and sharing a chopped salad."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great and the drinks stiff. They had a dinner special, 11oz lobster tail and 7oz fillet mignon for $54. Perfect portions, perfectly cooked. Yummy!"}
{"text":"It was somewhere outside of Barstow when the hunger began to take hold...  After a very long journey through a very hot desert, we at last pulled into the parking lot of our hotel, and after navigating a slipup on Travelocity's behalf, we finally collapsed onto our beds on our room. As soon as our core temperatures and stress levels started decreasing, our hunger levels began rising, and without waiting a second longer, we headed out the door to hunt down the steakhouse we had seen promised to us from the flashing marquee out front. We were seated immediately, and before we knew it, water was flowing and bread with the softest butter ever was ours for the taking. As we settled into the ambiance, the music changed to their evening music selection, and the very first song was none other than my favorite band! Pure luck, I know, but what the restaurant CAN take credit for is the UNBELIEVABLY outstanding service provided by wait staff member Joseph!!! I have enjoyed meals at Michelin-starred restaurants with wait staff who could learn MUCH from Joseph! Not only was he charming and engaging, but EXTREMELY knowledgeable, helpful, and attentive!! Charcoal Grill, you have a treasure in Joseph-- cherish him and the excellence he brings to your staff!"}
