{"text":"EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!Went there in the evening with my husband and it was dead. Everything was nice and fresh..I ordered the shrimp penne and my husband ordered the burger... So it was okay nothing special. I didn't get to finish my meal, I didn't even eat half and I found a piece of iron in my pasta...so I took it to the lady and she acted like I put it there. She still charged me half for the meal...we are never eating there again...customer service was good until I found the piece iron then it was like to hell with you guys.."}
{"text":"Service needs improvement.  The owner/waitress took 15+ minutes to initialize communication despite me standing up and trying to get her attention, then at the end of the meal she did not inform me (after me showing her my credit card) that I needed to come to the service desk to pay.  She did not visit during the meal (I was totally parched and had to come to her to get water).  Despite this, the breakfast I orderded was the BEST I hav ever had.  HUGE portion, great price, fast delivery, exquisite presentation, perfectly prepared to my odd specifications. The decor is HORRIBLE; straight out of the 80's; seriously, take down those awful curtains and valances, change the seat/bench fabric, remove all of the mismatched hunter/Italian/roccocco crap, and for cleanliness sake, DUST if you're going to leave all that shite there!  Yes, the food was that good to look over all this..."}
{"text":"It's a nice family restaurant ,waitresses are very friendly and helpful, they look after customers so well.I have ever been there for my breakfast and dinner, I like their food,huge portion, lower price, perfect condition. I ordered the New York steak in mid-rare, it was perfect pink inside, so juicy, so nice~I like it so much."}
{"text":"Went at 7:30 pm on a Saturday the place was dead. Ordered the club house which comes with fries and coleslaw was ok the bread was falling apart not the best I've ever had. The staff are really nice though so some points there."}
{"text":"Ok I get its fathers day so I get taking a long rime to get a table however...been sitting at the table now for an hour n 15 minutes. Had 2 servers pass by and ask if anyone came by and then continued on their way n never came back. Asked 1 of them when they passed by about 10 minutes layer if we were going to get served to get the excuse they are behind and short staffed...on fatgers day. 45 minutes in we finally got to place an order from a water who made it sound like he was doing us a favor by serving us. Now another 30 minutes after we've ordered n still waiting for our food. Better be realllllly good food to make up for the wait.  My suggestion...find another restaurant. Not worth the trouble and wait"}
{"text":"Good food and plenty of it! Very friendly staff ...Be Hungry!  Toasted Western is my favourite."}
{"text":"I have to admit, the outside decor is not so catchy, however the food is delicious. The servers are top notch. Our waiter Suzy was very pleasant and very attentive to our needs. My entire family was dining today, Suzy was extremely lovely toward my little baby girl.   The first time I heard of this place was in 2014.  I used there catering services for my daughter's communion. The amount of food that was provided was amazing. I had left overs.   Because there was no delivery choice and we had to pick up our food at the time of my my daughters  communion. And the fact that they do not have a baby change station available in the washroom that's the reason they get 4 stars today.   Overall, I am extremely happy with the service I received today. I will for sure be eating there again   Bona petite"}
{"text":"A great family spot - especially for breakfast.  Have been going here for Sunday breakfasts with my family for years. The service is warm and friendly.  Have never had a single complaint about the food. Everything is always very tasty from pancakes to the traditional egg/bacon breakfasts."}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant every Sunday with my son sometimes my friends The food is superb high-quality and fresh The French connection is my favourite  Three eggs sausages or bacon potatoes French toast omg so good coffee not expensive and a must"}
{"text":"Great little family restaurant if you are looking for a quick casual meal."}
{"text":"Been going to the Bounty for years even before it became Bounty. Great family restaurant. The breakfasts are by far the  best in Mississauga very big portions great prices and good service. Defiantly worth the trip to Mississauga make sure your hungry..."}
{"text":"You know those family restaurants, where if you are not part of the \"family\" (don't come here every week) you are not welcomed. I don't know maybe it was our server only. But it felt odd. And seemed like they were mad at us for no reason all the time. It was almost impossible to get coffee refill.  Food was ok, although reheated. starts for food. Don't get french toast. Its very dry."}
{"text":"We stopped at this little diner-type restaurant last night on the way home from some errands in Mississauga.  The parking lot was full but it seemed to be overflow from the Muddy Duck next door, as the place was empty.  I must say, for diner style food, they are very good.  Interior is a bit worn and nothing too fancy, but comfortable.  The server was very friendly and very helpful.  Beef barley soup was delicious.  A chicken souvlaki plate was very generous, including a large Greek salad with lots of feta, and a container of properly thick tzatziki.  The chicken was a tad dry, but tasty and well flavoured.  Ribs were tender and good."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with my daughter. Must say the food was not bad and averaged priced. Service was fine. I would go back, liked it allot better than the Muddy Duck next door"}
