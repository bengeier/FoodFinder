{"text":"My best friend and I used to go to this place when it was 5 tables in small space, I can't remember what street it was on. But it's incredible that it's this many years later and the food hasn't changed a bit. Fresh and always so delicious. The dumplings (my favorite: corn flower one, pork and dill , and pork shrimp and melon); they have boiled, pan fried, and steamed. The salads: seaweed, beansprout, and kimchi are awesome. If you're 4+ people and you all like the salads, order 2 of each kind for the table (or 1 salad for 2 people). Don't forget the onion and potato pancake as well as one of the buns (bean and bbq pork are our favs). Unlimited tea, make your own dip with soya+vinegar+heat (optional) is included.  The food is delicious the services is quick and super friendly. And the price can't be beat (tonight for 2 of us, $44 and that included 15% tip). We will be back again and again."}

{"text":"Delicious dumplings. But stick to that--the other food we ordered was a little underwhelming."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with cheap prices, great food and plenty of options. Vegan options and gluten free, as well as really good side dishes. The cucumber one especially.  One of the few places I've seen with plain congee which i've always wanted to try.   The serve is really good too.  Been there many times and always get what I'm looking for."}
{"text":"My review should be two stars but I gave an extra star for the cleanliness of the restaurant. Washrooms, dining area, kitchen. My wife and I were constantly hounded by our friends to try this place. So good, blah,blah,yak,yak..... Let me tell you something...don't believe the hype.  There was too many cooks in the kitchen, most of them young and not doing much. If you've got time to talk...make my food. We waited a long time for the food. Mostly dumplings and a few other dishes. I had the pork/bak choi dumplings and they wre so salty I could not finish all 10. This is the first time in my life I never finished or taken home the dumplings to finish at a later time. Next was the shrimp fried rice, again salty and the rice was a mixture of old and fresh rice. Not a great mixture, some of the rice was soft, some was hard. Very little shrimp included in the dish.  My wife and her friend had the steamed dumplings but also salty and they were not closed right so a few of them was falling apart. My wife's friend kept apologizing for how bad the meal was and said they usually were not that bad. Usually? This place loves salt from what I can tell and I never did find out why there was so many cooks and why we waited 20 minutes for our mains. Only thing that was decent was the Hot/Sour soup. A soup that usually is salty but their's was not. Went there a second time with my wife's boss and pretty much the same things happened again. Salty, long wait, poorly closed dumplings, rice was hard, too many cooks in the kitchen doing nothing."}
{"text":"I'm often hard pressed to find good vegetarian dumplings in Toronto... but these ones are really tasty! The steamed melon / tofu / vegetable noodle dumplings are my favourite. Their green onion pancake is really good too. The perfect go-to place for a cheap lunch/dinner out."}
{"text":"Nothing impressive et nothing to be critical. It's just a typical dumpling spot, good enough to try out once.   I'm vegetarian and I had the boiled chive & noodle one, and steamed veggies & tofu dumplings. I paid 19 in total tip included.  For me, I won't go back cuz veggie options are limited."}
{"text":"One out of five stars for the one out five dishes we received. That dish was the fried pork dumplings. It was good but not great, warm but not hot. Unfortunately the review stops here because after two glasses of wine and the dumplings we waited for almost an hour for four dishes that never arrived, before we decided to cut our losses and get the bill. Our waiter had disappeared. And the manager charged us for what little we ate and drank.  Too many other great Chinese options in the area to ever go back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal at Mother's Dumplings. The place was clean compared to other places I've visited in Chinatown and I like that they have an open kitchen. It was cool to see how they rolled the dough and filled the dumplings.   After reading several reviews on here regarding positive and negative points of the green onion pancake I had to try it for myself and it was actually my favourite of the 3 things we ordered. It was crisp on the outside, tasty, and the hot sauce + soy sauce made it even better. My second favourite item was the steamed shrimp dumplings. They were very tasty and I liked the presentation in the round wooden steamer. We also ordered boiled chicken dumplings which were ok, but I didn't much care for the presentation. I think I'll stick to steamed dumplings in the future, or fried ones if they ever offer any without pork.  The service was efficient but not friendly. I think one of the people bringing food to our table might have spoken English which lends credibility to the quality of the food but I wouldn't have wanted to try to explain any special dietary restrictions.   I'm giving 3 stars instead of 4 because of the lack of variety of non-pork fillings. I don't eat pork and would have loved to try a few other things but there were only a few pork-free dumplings. If you like pork you will be very happy here. I would definitely go back to Mother's Dumplings."}
{"text":"great for large groups! totally acceptable dumplings for absurdly low prices. very nice servers as well. the only thing missing is a liquor license, so get drunk first."}
{"text":"Phenomenal dumplings!! We went on a rainy Friday afternoon. We ordered port and chive steamed dumplings and a pork fried dumpling. They came quickly and were excellently made. They have a chili on the table to mix in the soy and it was an excellent addition!! Service was attentive and honest. Prices were reasonable. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with my family. We arrived at 7 on a Saturday so the restaurant was rather busy. They seemed to be understaffed because it took almost 15 minutes until a waitress came and figured out how many people where in line and gave us all numbers. We where number 3 and got seated fairly quickly.   We decided to order a variety of thinga because we had never been here before. We had our order written down and waited for a good 15 minutes till the waiter came and took our order slip.   A few minutes later the food began arriving. We had some delicious steamed pork dumplings and some vegetarian dumplings as well. I also order a big beef bun and decided to try that out. I bit into it to find that there was not much meat inside, and then when I got to the beef it was FROZEN! I wasn't really that bothered so I continued eating.   A waiter then came by our table and grabbed our empty plates but one of them still had a dumpling on it!! It was in plain sight and we where still eating so when she took it away we tried to stop her but she walked away. We got some rice and fried green beans as well which where delicious but then when we finished those the waiter came and cleared those plates and the stack of steamers, but there was still a big beef bun in the steamers!!!!   We had unfinished food taken away from us 2 times, definitely not pleased with that. We gave them a 5 cent tip and headed out. The food was absolutely delicious but the service was sub par. Maybe they need to hire more wait staff"}
{"text":"We found ourselves looking for a place for a late lunch and ended up at Mother's Dumplings at the recommendation of a friend. The pan seared pork and green onion dumplings were amazing and the steamed pork & bok choy not to be missed. They were flavorful and delicate. All in all everything was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I first made my visit to Mother's Dumplings in 2011. The food back then was unbelievably delicious. It left me such a deep and positive impression that I vowed to return when I'm back in Toronto.   Today, after more than 2 years since my last visit, everything's change... For the worst! The xiaolongbao (juicy pork dumplings) has the thickest greasiest skin and the most tasteless pork filling. The wanton soup was bland, despite an overdose of tiny dried shrimps. Wantons tasted average.   The onion pancake was greasy on the surface, but was utterly tasteless. There was more flour than onion in it. In fact if memory serves me right, the onion pancake today looks super thick. My Mum, who's Chinese, tells me this is the worst onion pancake she's ever taste in her entire 50+ years of lifetime. We gave up eating after taking a slice each.  The shrimp, pork and melon dumplings has got to be the worst order of the day. Overall, the taste was super greasy and the orange skin just looks artificial and unpalatable. My Mum and I gave up eating the dumplings with the skin and just ate the fillings.  But I can't recall how the filling tastes... Guess it was just too tasteless!!!  Just as our stewed beef noodles arrived, my Mum had conceded defeat and told me she lost all appetite to eat further. Strangely the noodles look like udon to me. I was expecting La Mien. Taste-wise... The sliced beef seems to needs more stewing and less salt and MSG added.  I tried canceling the dessert but  was told we cannot cancel any items on our order once we place our order!! We had just the sweet steamed buns left in our order but with the bad experience for the other items, we couldn't eat any further. After complaining how awful the food was among ourselves in Mandarin the waiter returned to our table and told us we could cancel our dessert.   I really wanted to tell the waiter how awful the food tasted today and how it used to taste so much better. But I suppose he's heard for himself and saw how much food was left untouched on the table to conclude how crappy they were. I feel awfully bad recommending my Mum to try this place. I also felt disappointed and foolish to have missed eating their Xiaolongbaos when the ones back home in Singapore tasted so much better.   I don't think I'll ever return to this place again in my lifetime and I sure hope I won't be writing another bad review for a restaurant I used to like."}
{"text":"I decided to try Mother's Dumpling after reading many great reviews about this place. I had high expectations as they had just moved from their hole-in-the-wall location and surprisingly the food was just so so. The business is very family run therefore you might have to wait a while for your food. I had to painfully watch the next table next to me get their food before me when they came in and ordered 10 minutes after me! It was very frustrating as I had to wait almost 30 minutes for my order. The pan fried dumplings we had were very unpresentable. Half of them came out broken where the cook stacked the dumplings on top of each other instead of nicely presenting them in a plate, it was a real mess. I won't lie, the meat fillings are yummy but the shells are too starchy and floury for my liking. I know this is a Shanghai signature style but I like my shell to be thin which is usually the Hong Kong style. The dumplings were also not as \"juicy\" as I was hoping either - quite dry actually. I don't think I'll come back here to quench my dumpling cravings.  Sorry Mother."}
{"text":"No juice in the juicy dumplings.  Went there after a sporting event.  Ordered a variety of things including boiled, steamed, fried dumplings.  All were ok except the juicy dumplings (little dragon) which all stuck to the bamboo steamer and had no juice in them.    Dinner came out to $15 per person which was expensive I thought for the quantity of food.    No problems with the service or general atmosphere.  Just think you could do better for the price.  There is really nothing special about the food."}
{"text":"The Mother's Dumplings is one of the best place for dumplings in Toronto. You can always find your type of dumplings you want as they provide boiled, steamed, and fried dumplings with either beef, shrimp, pork, vegetable, etc. They also have delicious pancakes, buns and other dishes."}
{"text":"After a 15 minute wait on a Sat night, the waiter brought us to a table next to the window. He was attentive to our needs and was prompt with getting our order.  We tried three dishes: steamed shrimp, eggs and chive dumplings, steamed pork and chives and pan fried pork and bak choi. The dumplings were a good portion and cooked perfectly. Between two of us, we had a feast alongside jasmine tea. Overall, great comfort food in a nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"It was not an outstanding. As for service. Really. First greeted with the question do you have a reservation.  Then we thought we were going to be turned away. But decided that we were worthy of a seat. We had to beg for a beverage.  It was beneath one of the servers to accept orders for beer and wine.  He made it quit clear in his demeanor that he rather be having a root canal then serve us drinks. I had questions about the menu. He was clueless.  He didn't know  what I was asking  He said if I wanted to know look at the pictures on the menu. Seriously????????   I had brought family from out of town there. Never never never again. I would rather take them to McDonald's then step foot in that place again. At least at McDonald's you get greated with a smile."}
{"text":"We were nicely greeted and seated right by the window. The table is set with the above crucial accompaniments: vinegar, sriracha, chili oil and soy sauce. Our sweetiepie waitress gave us the menu which is a laminated trifold. Beside each dish is a code, one letter followed by a number. You fill out your order on the piece of paper accordingly. The dumplings page of the menu divides the dumplings into boiled, steamed and pan-seared varieties. The other pages list sides, noodles, pancakes and rice dishes.  The hot & sour soup was extremely flavourful and had shreds of carrots in it that were a little long and therefore difficult to catch in the spoon provided. Mothers definitely uses a heavy hand of cornstarch in their recipe because it was hands down the most gelatinous hot & sour soup I have ever had. At $5.99 it is a generous portion and can easily be split between two or even three people. Not the best hot & sour soup but definitely worth trying.  The beef buns were ordered pretty much solely on curiosity. The buns are two to an order for about $4. We spotted them on a fellow diner's table and were intrigued by their size, I would say they are easily the size of a baseball. I am not a huge Chinese foodie so these were new to me. I broke my bun with my chopsticks opposed to bitting right in so I could inspect the contents. It wasn't as easy as you would expect. The dough is very thick, half an inch easily. In the middle of the bun lays a 2 ounce beef patty. The beef is exceptionally moist and the flavour is excellent. The dough is soft and fresh but I find eating the bun in its entirety would drown out the flavour of the beef. I am the kind of person who prefers open-faced sandwiches so eating only part of the dough is my equivalent.  The dumplings were the star of the show hands down. In an attempt to be \"healthy\" we selected from the steamed dumpling section, specifically the juicy pork dumplings. These dumplings contain broth in the dumpling, many know this variety as soup dumplings (not to be confused with dumpling soup). The dumplings at Mothers are slightly smaller than I am used to for soup dumplings and contain less broth. I am just being nitpicky and trying to find a flaw here. They were amazing. The pork was mixed with chive and the broth wasn't too salty or hot... so we could dive right in. For about $7 there are eight to an order although only seven are pictured. My eager dining companion couldn't help himself. Like it's Italian counterpart ravioli, the dough is the foundation of a great dumpling. No matter how delicious the filling, if the dough is too thick or off in any way it can never been great. Good, yes. Great, no. That said the dough was perfect. They are clearly fresh- you can see them being made all day long by the chef. Thin and light yet don't fall apart when you take the first bite."}
{"text":"First time this place opened in Danforth, I thought they could not keep up the same quality with their original place. Well, I was wrong :) dumplings are as good as ever"}
{"text":"Extremely RUDE manager! The manager asks to see my Canadian issued debit card before I can order! Unbelievable!! This was probably the rudest customer service I've seen anywhere in Canada so far, I'm asking all my friends to avoid this place and will post this review on every website possible, save your precious time and money and enjoy your time at another place, AVOID this place!"}
{"text":"I had to grab some food, and had heard great things about this place. I came in just after opening to get a quick lunch of yummy dumplings. They were delicious and for this I give them four stars.  But, the service was... upleasant. I don't know if it was because I was on my own, or just because, but I was placed in a gloomy, middle part of the restaurant, with crappy plastic chairs (they had nicer chairs elsewhere--these particular, flimsy, fold out patio chairs seemed particular to this one table, but I may be wrong). Just after I had placed my order, while I was still trying to decide whether or not to feel annoyed, a man who worked at the restaurant arrived, smiled and nodded pleasantly at me... and turned on the light over where I was sitting, so I wasn't just lurking in the dark on a crappy plastic chair. This way, I could actually see what I was eating, once my order arrived. His friendliness mitigated my impression somewhat, while simultaneously casting the disdain of the regular wait staff into even greater relief.  Knowing this, next time I would be somewhat more assertive in firmly--but politely--requesting a better place to sit (esp. given that it was just me and two other customers in the entire restaurant--obviously, if it's during rush, then you sit where you sit!)."}
{"text":"Second time with a large group. Service was quick and friendly and the food was average to above average. The juicy pork dumplings stood out by far. Unfortunately a lot of the steamed and boiled dumplings end up tasting the same.  I will continue to recommend based on service and quantity but the food could be better."}
{"text":"Awesome experience.  We went as a party of four, ordered 3 sets of dumplings, 2 plates of veggies and 1 desert dumpling (worked out to $60 after tax & tip). All very authentic, delicious and fresh. I like how the wrapping was thin. The decor was a throwback to the old style Chinese restaurant but still chic. Best of it the place is baby friendly. They didn't have a microwave (that's how fresh it is) so they steamed my baby's food for me.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The choices of dishes are limited. the taste of food may match western people's taste better,. But from a chinese person's perspective, its definitely below average. It looks like chinese restaurant(decoration, music), but does not taste like it."}
{"text":"No frills dumpling house, but WOW..the best pork & chive dumplings we've ever had!  I miss them so much.  I haven't stopped craving them since our return home.  :'(  Even a simple dish like the Chinese Broccoli was delicious..made with small, delicate stalks, which allows for faster cooking and retain their crunchiness..unlike the HUGE, tough stalks we normally find in NY."}
{"text":"The waiting time is too long. Basically you have to wait 30 min before you can enjoy your meal. Also, the price is too high compared to other dumpling restaurant."}
{"text":"Fast service, inexpensive, good quality dim sum.  Visited: Jan. 19, 2014"}
{"text":"Must try: chive noodle boiled dumplings. Service isn't the best but the dumplings are worth it."}
{"text":"They have a large variety of quite authentic dumplings but I have definitely had better (being Chinese and all). They have a fairly large restaurant but the cleanliness leaves a bit to be desired. All in all an average place however I would not go again. I think it is built up way to much."}
{"text":"For less than $40 my boyfriend and I walked out of Mother's Dumplings with more food than we were able to eat in one sitting. We ordered a selection of steamed dumplings (Red Bean, Lamb Shummai, Bao, and Desert Buns) and one order of Pan Fried Pork and Bak Choy Dumplings.  Service was quick and friendly. Upon entry we were offered a seat, but instead chose carry out. Our order took a reasonable amount of time (thirty minutes), as these are hand made on the premises. We had enough time to walk to the 7-Eleven to grab some drinks and walk back, and the food was ready to go.  This is obviously a popular place - most seats were occupied by 6pm on a Monday night. There seems to be a lack of air conditioning, but attempts to cool the place (or at least have air flow) were made via multiple fans strewn throughout the restaurant. Had I been eating in, I would probably not have enjoyed myself due to the temperature and amount of bodies in the space.  The dumplings ranged from \"pretty damn good\" to \"meh\". My top picks from our selection: the Shumai, and Pork and Bak Choy. Both were tender and juicy. Neither needed the dipping sauces provided as both had deep meaty flavors. The steamed Bao were good, but I prefer baked. The dough was, however, perfect. The Red Bean was not a new favorite, I would have liked them to be a little bit sweeter. The Desert dumplings were hit or miss. Some were texturally off-putting (gelatinous with a custard filling). But the sweet corn balls were delicious. They were not too sweet, and the flavor popped.  Next time i'm in Toronto i'll try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"The food is okay here and the best dish I think is the No 15 Juicy Pork Buns, they are dumplings that have a soupy juice inside them ( pork). The service is abysmal as you have to wait an eternity to get your food. At least it's clean though.... overall nothing particularly special I really don't know why Torontonians rave about the place..... it's a mediocre joint overall."}
{"text":"Ambiance: casual walk-in with full view of dumpling making kitchen  Service: mark your own order on the menu, friendly staff, entrees come as available  Must tries: boiled pork and chive dumplings, soup dumplings, fried long green beans"}
{"text":"Decor is terrible, and on a winter day the door opening will give you a blast you won't soon forget, but these dumplings make it all worthwhile.  Try the duck, chicken and mushroom, or pork and chives. You can't go wrong whether they are boiled, steamed, or fried. The liberal use of fresh herbs keeps you craving just one more dumpling before you cry uncle to mother."}
{"text":"Went for a light lunch today and had the steamed BBQ pork rolls and beef & chive dim sum. All very good and great prices! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Clean interior, interesting decor. There's a window where you can watch the staff making the dumplings. Great place to satisfy that dumpling craving."}
{"text":"These were so-so. The juicy dumplings were not as juicy as other soup dumplings I've had."}
{"text":"I love Mother's Dumplings, the food is so savory and delicious. I've gone there at least ten times now, and every one I bring likes it too. They have those menu cards that you check your selections off yourself, and sometimes the waiters bring things in random order so its a good place to share and collaborate on selections, that way you can eat things as they show up. The waiters are pleasant and efficient, but this is not a place to go if you want to ask endless questions and have elaborate service. Don't be surprised if there is sometimes a bit of a line to be seated they are almost always busy and for good reason...the dumplings are magical! You can openly see them being prepared..from scratch! The bathrooms are very clean and well kept, they have only two though..men's and ladies. I am especially loyal to Mother's Dumplings now because the last time I was there I left my Christian Dior glasses behind and when I called the next day they had them waiting safely behind the counter for me. I've had almost every flavor and type of dumpling the vegetarian chive ones are my very favorite and the onion pancakes are tasty, they are pan fried so I'd treat them like a very hearty appetizer, again, you might want to share. Don't know much about the other dishes, I had a soup one time but had to share it it was so big, I think it was hot and sour soup, it was delicious, but my friend had their basic broth soup it was kind of bland with seaweed floating around...not something she'd order again. Otherwise they've got my thumbs up all the way!"}
{"text":"Mothers is an average dumpling joint. On the positive side, the variety of steamed, boiled and fried dumplings is fairly good. the boiled pork dill dumplings and fried pork shrimp and melon dumplings are great. The beef and onion roll is fairly good as well.  On the negative side, the steamed pork chive dumplings and lamb shiu mi were not good...dumplings were falling apart and the wrappers were overly thick. To top it off service www marginal.   In the end, it was good for a night but we won't go back."}
{"text":"I just got back from lunch and I'm so disappointed. I used to frequent their old hole in the wall location which was pretty good, but this new one has let me down.   They've dressed the front of the place up, but clearly they ran out of money while renovating because the tables and chairs at the back of the restaurant are old! Most importantly though, the food has taken a huge dive. The xiao long bao had no soup inside, and the beef pancakes arrived cold. The old location felt authentic - the new location had a few white guys working in the kitchen. Enough said. Service wise they were never good, but this time they forgot one of our plates and we had to cancel it.  I'm sad to report that although the old Mother Dumplings was a good joint, don't bother with the new one."}
{"text":"Even TnT's handmade frozen dumplings tastes much better. The dumplings were bland, my coworkers used up 3/4 bottle of soy sauce. and sure they tastes good to them, but what Chinese dumplings require soy as dipping sauce and not a single drop of vinegar? The dumpling skin is just very very thick in general, so you taste more bland skin than any juicy meat.  The bigger steamed bao type of dumpling - the bottom tastes like wet bread. After one bite, the tiny meat just falls out like it belongs somewhere else. That was particularly bad I don't even want to think about it.  Average dumplings do not taste like that at all. How can this be \"dumplings heaven\", or \"best dumplings\" completely escapes me. Do you see a lot of Chinese people visiting? That should an obvious sign.  We were ordered 14 dishes for a table of 6. End up $20 per person for meh-lunch. I was still hungry afterwards despite lots of leftovers but I just cannot have another bite.  PS. While watching them wrap behind the window, i saw them stretch the dumpling after they've finished wrapping. Pardon my ignorance, but I haven't seen anyone stretching a dumpling before."}
{"text":"Great for lunch (though it might take a little while).  Very affordable, great to go to with a bunch of friends and order a bunch of dumplings. Their broth soup (which only costs $1.50) is a great deal because it's MASSIVE and has seaweed and little shrimp in it.   Really a great value and delicious dumplings."}
{"text":"This place has such delicious food. It's great for a date night, but you can go with friends, or even your parents. Definitely get there around 6, because after that, you can't get a seat. Service kind of sucks sometimes, but the food is so good, you don't care!! Plus it's on the cheap side :)"}
{"text":"The food was good that the price was appropriate for the serving size, my problem was the service: waiting 101 you do not serve one customer before the other when both order at the same time. I had to wait 5 plus minutes to get my dish after my friend got his. But that did not sour my pallet, the food was good and I would go back, anytime I am in the mood for dumplings."}
{"text":"Stopped in while on vacation. The guy sitting at the table next to me was eating a really good looking beef noodle dish, but i could not resist the fresh made dumplings. Me any my friend tried a few different kinds steamed, fried, and boiled, and all of them were great. Taste and consistency were spot on with what you would want.   Environment was really neat as well. Most tables overlook the prep area where a you can see the dumplings being made from scratch.  I would definitely go again and recommend to friends in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Whoever gave a good review to this place should venture out of Chinatown and try any similar restaurants in Scarborough or Markham. Chances are any pick of restaurants elsewhere would be better and cheaper than Mother's. Here you should expect to pay DOUBLE the market price and get HALF of the usual portion. My onion pancake @ $4.19 was the size of a saucer. It was neither crispy nor crunchy. Tasted more like previously frozen supermarket stuff. Same serving size for the tofu strip salad @$3.79. Gosh the tofu was so dry it was like never cooked. The three BBQ buns did not even fill half the size of the steamer they came in. The green beans and pork was watery and salty, at $8.99 was only a thin layer full, barely covering the plate. The pork was like left overs from last night's dumplings. So what happened to \"?\"? The soup filled dumplings were all punctured (either from poorly made outer skin or over cooked) when they were delivered to our table and dried out completely before we had the chance to eat them, more appropriately to call them soupless dumplings. The green bean vermicelli salad northern style @ $8.49 was also watery and tasteless. My wife, who never wasted any food, tossed out half the order today because it was simply so bad. On the other hand, our server was attentive and nice, all the dishes overall were delivered quickly. But the main criteria for me are quality and price, and for that I cannot give more than one star. The check came out to $66 for 2 adults and 2 kids. When I gave my server 4 x $20, she asked \" do you still need the change?\"...... Not recommended and will not return."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the dumplings, and would definitely be back when in the area, but I wouldn't say they're worth going out of the way for."}
{"text":"Trust any restaurant that's got a line-up on a Tuesday night! The host warned me it would be 20 minutes before we got a table, but I was seated in ten--my friends hadn't even gotten there before I sat down.  Service was slow because the place was so crowded, but the dumplings were fabulous.  I wouldn't order anything that wasn't on the dumpling menu, though--we also tried the steamed buns and the sesame balls, and both were disappointing (the ratio of filling to dough in the beef buns was way off--too much tasteless bun, not enough meat, and the sesame balls were chewy and kind of gross).  Still, the dumplings were delicious and totally hit the spot--I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Heading home, kept getting a very strong fish smell and it was the bags. Gross! Not sure why your plastic bags smelled of fish but it was not pleasant (especially because there was no fish in the order).   Dumplings were very tasty, as always, but we also ordered a wonton soup and holy sh*t!! It was the most DISGUSTING thing I have ever tasted... and smelled. How do you screw up wonton soup? One bite and it was in the garbage. Honestly, it was one of the most repulsive smells. I would have preferred the fish bags over that sewage being passed off as soup. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Went here and also Mothers Dumplings after reading Yelpers comments.  Thoroughly enjoyed the xiao long bao (aka soup dumplings), although they took a looooooong time to arrive and were not the usual piping hot.  (Maybe they pegged us as amateurs and deliberately delayed the delivery because they thought that we would burn our viscera?) This place was hopping at lunch apparently with academia from the local university.  Nevertheless XLB were not the best we've had, but would return if we were back in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible service. This place has gone down in quality and service so much. We waited for each dish so long by the time the next one came we've devoured the first. Waitress also pretended not to see us a few times. Our last dumpling never made it to our table after more than 1 hr so we cancelled it.   Flavour wise, it was also lacking. Taste was bland and skin too thick.   Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"They have great dumplings! However, the last few times I was there during lunch and dinner, it was really busy. To the point that it took more than 45 min before getting the food. I appreciate that is made fresh from the skin but the waiting time is too long.  I recommend going at off-meal times."}
{"text":"Love Mothers dumplings. They are so much better then the frozen ones and worth the price difference."}
{"text":"Maybe something gets lost in translation, but I have seen these listed as \"juicy buns\" and \"soup dumplings.\" Soup dumplings seems a little more descriptive to me while juicy buns conjures up images of something not meant to be eaten. Whatever they are called, they are the perfect package of soup broth and seasoned meat, but unfortunately they are hard to find.   In Toronto we discovered some in Chinatown at a place called Mother's Dumplings. While these are not the best I've had (they were more meat than soup) they were still very good and seasoned well. Along with the \"juicy buns,\" as they were called here, we had Da-Lu Noodles, a soup I've never seen or tasted before and pan fried pork dumplings."}
{"text":"I've been going to Mother's Dumplings since 2009 and used to love it. Unfortunately, the last two times in a row I've come, the service has been terrible (ie: one hour wait times with no explanation and little apology), and no member of the staff responded by offering to compensate me in any way. The first time I walked away hungry and the second time my mom, who I was treating, did. Furthermore, their prices have gone up and their dumplings aren't the best in the city by a long shot. I recommend Dumpling House between Bathurst and Christie on Bloor. You get more dumplings for way less and their dumplings are scrumptious. Also, their service is incredible and their wait staff is personable and attentive."}
{"text":"Dumplings are one of my comfort foods, and they make some really delicious steamed dumplings here. I usually go for the juicy pork bun dumplings and then either shrimp or tofu dumplings (steamed, not boiled), for a little variety.  They also sell frozen dumplings that you can boil at home. They're more expensive than the mass-produced frozen dumplings you can buy at the supermarket, but the ingredients are superior and the shells are thicker."}
{"text":"After trying out Dumpling King up in Scarborough, one of my readers suggested that I try Mother's Dumplings located in downtown Chinatown on Spadina Avenue.  Did you know that I practically grew up in this old Chinatown? As a child , my grandparents took me here a few times a week during my summer holidays and I would learn all of the different grocery stores and dim sum restaurants. A great walk down memory lane to have Piquey Eater adventures come back here.   Bringing the attention to the food, Mother's Dumplings causes a serious case of nostalgia with chinese comfort food and makes it very approachable for the novice diner. With a menu that breaks down the different dumplings into steamed, boiled and pan fried, this is a great location for a person new to Chinese home cooking.  My favourite dish from the night would have to be pork and vegetable pancake and the beef onion roll. Both meaty in flavour for the stuffing and dumpling skins that weren't too thick.

{"text":"I grew up in Beijing and this is the only place in Toronto that makes the dumplings the way its supposed to be, it tastes like true old northern China, steaming hot on Chinese New Year's eve with the whole family sitting down to make them and eat it together. The service is like yonge and bloor station at rush hour but there's been plenty of warning on that regard, so I'm only rating the food here. That said, if you want to discover real Chinese food, this is the best bet at this price range, and it provides an authentic experience both in terms of taste and wait times."}
{"text":"I visited this place last week with a friend on a Friday evening. This place was packed with a number of people waiting at the door for a table. Prices are quite reasonable, costing around $7 for a plate of dumplings.  I order the \"Juicy Pork Dumplings\" aka the soup dumplings or Xiao Long Bao. While good and very much edible with the juicy (not dry) meat filling, there was none of that reknown soup inside that came out once the dumpling was pierced. That was a let down considering that the server said it was their most popular item.  My friend ordered the regular Boiled Pork and Cabbage Dumpling.. Good but tasted like a regular old dumpling. I also order the ubiquitous Green Onion Pancake. Again good but required a tad bit more seasoning (aka salt).  Service is good and quick, as you find in any Asian restaurant. Is the food memorable? Not at all.  However, there is good choice, good location and good prices to draw a crowd.  Not a place I'd be running back to anytime soone."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's truly value for money. Tasty dumplings and quick service.   I would recommend the pork & dill dumplings, the wonton soup and the green onion pancake. Very satisfying!  Since discovering it a few months ago, I have already visited it 4 times!"}
{"text":"Had to give this a try since the reviews were decent.   We ordered a few items to try since it was our first time.   1. Kimchi, wasn't that great.  Wasn't fermented enough for us.   2. Shrimp pork steamed dumplings were pretty good.   3. Juicy pork dumplings looked like they were on steroids... All the juice seemed to get sucked up by the type of wonton wrapping they used so didn't seem so juicy. 4. Tried the dumpling soup.  Thought it would actually have dumplings but it didn't!  Just plain ol' soup.  Kind of salty. Probably wouldn't order again.   Clean place and service was pretty good.  Overall, decent for the price.  Food was okay, nothing really stood out.  Next time were in Toronto we'll probably stop by again if were craving dumplings!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to go to in Chinatown, especially when the weather gets chilly.  Walking down into this tiny basement dumpling house is a cozy experience, and the windows steam up in this lovely way that makes it feel like you're crawling into the warm belly of one of their dumplings.  To be frank, Mother's Dumplings isn't really the best designed restaurant in Toronto.  I'm secretly hoping that one of these days they will be featured on Restaurant Makeover, because yes, the interior leaves something to be desired.  But in a way, it's that much more charming: the near-patio style furniture, the funny little decorative arrangements and the oddly captivating DVDs that constantly play seemingly incongruent still images with what seem to be Chinese ballads playing in the background. Seriously, I've seen buildings, flowers, puppies, babies and robots on those DVDs before.  The main rule when you go to Mother's Dumpling (as with all of Toronto's sweetheart downmarket eateries) is that you need to put your patience cap on.  The following is the list of suggestions I give to all first time visitors to the eatery:  Have a snack on the way over so you don't get that crazy hunger rage waiting for your food.  Yes, be prepared to wait extraordinary amounts of time for your food.  Be prepared to share your food as nothing will come out of the kitchen at the same time, and your hungry friends will give you the cut eye if you don't share.  Be prepared for them to be out of what you really want.  If you're a vegetarian, let them know up front and be sure to ask if they have the (sadly few) veggie options available that night.  Eat the hot sauce.  Order the green onion pancake on the side, honestly you will never, ever regret that choice (esp since they are pretty much the cheapest thing on the menu).  Be ambitious and try something even if it sounds weird, the food is all delicious and cheap enough that you can afford to make a misstep.  Most of all, be patient, flexible, and tip big.    The back story on this place is a husband and wife duo opened up the restaurant with the mother-in-law on hand to supervise the kitchen.  Everything about the place proves it to be a family-run place with heart.  When I was subletting near Chinatown last year I would often see the husband running around the neighborhood picking up ingredients.  It's one popular little place, and boy do all the staff bust their asses there.  So be nice, tip big and come back lots.  Although once you have a bellyful of warm delicious dumplings you will planning your next trip anyway."}
{"text":"Beef onion roll wasn't the usual greasy wrap but a fresh firm roll, boiled dumplings were tasty, and the pork and chive steamed dumplings had a nice chewy wrap with a fresh bright green chive filling.  I thought it was better than the dumpling house further south on spadina, as those dumpling wraps are less chewy and the filling seems to be well...filling instead of pork and chives."}
{"text":"Most of the time, the most authentic Asian food can be found in really small dirty hole-in-the-wall type of places. But Mother's Dumplings is the exception, not the rule.   So I'm Asian, I walk into an Asian restaurant in the middle of Chinatown, and I see that none of the patrons are Asian, I know something is not right (don't get me wrong, I have nothing against that, but you get the gist).   For a tiny hole in the wall with minimal decoration and lousy service, I found the food a bit overpriced. Dumplings are really cheap to make (think about the ingredients), so they're probably making a huge profit margin by charging $5.5 +tax for a dozen.   The dumplings were good, but no phenomenal. I've had many dumplings before and this did not stand out as one of the best. The beef hand-made noodles were decent but not particularly impressive either."}
{"text":"I took the advice of a Yelp review and went to try the xiao long bao (Shanghai soup dumplings called \"juicy soup dumplings\" on the menu if I recall correctly). The dumplings were steaming as only freshly made dumplings are.  The filling was savouy and juicy.  I was a bit disappointed that there was not enough \"soup\" in this dumpling to enjoy with a bit of black vinegar.  I would go back again to try them again.  And because Its too far to Markham.  The garlic bok choi was tasty and acomapnied by mushrooms with a decilate flavour."}
{"text":"There's nothing quite like mother's dumplings. I moved to Texas last summer and anytime I'm in Toronto for a weekend I make sure to come here. This place is Toronto :). I love the delicious juicy pork dumplings!"}
{"text":"Overpriced everything.  I had the juicy pork dumplings, beef buns and some wonton soup (it was cold outside!). The juicy pork dumplings were good, but not anything outstanding. Granted, I was spoiled by actually going to Taiwan and having really excellent soup/juicy dumplings, but I don't think that experience would mar my palate so much as to think any less of their quality. It just wasn't that good, and definitely not something I'd trek out into the cold for.  The beef buns were understuffed and not that tasty. The wonton soup was really underseasoned, but had way too many chives and fried onions in it, but the dumplings in the soup were good.  DEFINITELY NOT worth the price. You can buy a few meals in Chinatown for what they charge here. It just isn't justifiable. Go down to Dumpling House (get the fried dumplings, preferably lamb) or like, anywhere else if you can, and don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"What is with the hype? I've eaten here twice. The first time was about 2 years ago and it was mediocre to bad. For some reason I went back tonight to give it a second chance, and it was even worse than I remembered. Mother's Dumplings gets my vote for worst dumplings in the city. Overcooked, oversalted with none of that satisfying and delicious flavour and aroma that should be unlocked when you bite into a dumpling. Avoid this place unless you have no taste buds or you love paying to be disappointed and queasy at the end of a meal."}
{"text":"This place just opened on the Danforth. I walk by it every night on my way home so I thought I'd check it out. I'm not a dumpling expert so wasn't really knowing what to expect. I was pretty well the first person in for dinner at around 6:45. The place got busy just after I arrived. Service was impeccable and the meal started with complimentary tea. I have to admit I was a little lost with the menu at the beginning. Lots of choice. Thinking this place would be better taken in as a group of people in order to share a number of dishes. I ordered some dumplings (12 but got 13...bonus) and a noodle dish. Noodle dish was tasty and so were the dumplings. Ended up costing me 19 dollars including tax and tip. Thought this was slightly pricey but again, I'm not the expert on Dumpling places. Definitely was stuffed by the end of it all. Would I go again. Sure."}
{"text":"I would go there every day to eat. Most restaurants I visit a few times, I find out what I like (because while I'm not a picky eater at ALL, I do have preferences, PLUS I'm vegetarian) and order it every time.   I've only gone to Mother's Dumplings 3 times, and I have tried something new every single visit. The hot and sour soup is delicious, the green onion pancake is fantastic, the mushroom and kale steamed dumpling is perfect, and the vegetarian bun is incredibly satisfying.  The portions are fair, the price is almost ideal, the location is great, the service is friendly, and I've never had to wait to sit down, although it has always been pretty full. I would recommend this place to anyone: definitely on my top five list for favourite places to dine!"}
{"text":"Very flavourful dumplings, probably the best in Chinatown. I can't believe no one's mentioned their tomato soup yet - it's probably the tastiest soup ever!"}
{"text":"I was super psyched to go to Mother's Dumplings.  After perusing their website in preparation for our trip, I was happy to see the cute pic of \"Mother\" grinning and clapping in front of her birthday cake.  But I think we ordered wrong.  We should have just stuck with the dumplings.  Instead we also tried their lamb shiu mai and their soup dumplings, both steamed.  The shiu mai didn't have a very strong flavor.  After having the lamb dumplings at Dumpling House, I expected more from this.  The soup dumplings had zero soup in them.  The filling wasn't bad, but where's the soup?  It also tasted like there was coconut in these - I didn't like the sweetness it added.  We also ordered the pan fried dumplings, which were fantastic.  Every single dumpling had a nice crispy side to it, and the dumpling skins were thicker for the purposes of pan frying.  I looked around the restaurant and everyone ordered boiled dumplings and a made-from-scratch scallion pancake.  I think I would've had a better meal if I had just done as the Romans do."}
{"text":"Enjoy the variety of chive dumplings but the wait, whether eat-in or take-out, can be lengthy. Not impressed during one visit when a person who ordered quite a bit of take-out after me, left 20 minutes before me?! Only go to curb a craving and have the time to spare."}
{"text":"One of the best places to grab a delicious, cheap bite in Chinatown. My partner and I are both vegetarians and they have tons of options for us. More variety than most dumpling joints and all terrific. Our favourites are the boiled chive and noodle dumplings and steamed melon and tofu dumplings. Give the tofu strip salad a try (yum!) but stay away from the dessert dumplings."}
{"text":"We're in Toronto for a conference and we saw that this was rated highly so we went last night. It was good, if a tad salty, but the thing that lowered the rating was the fact that we sat by the women making the dumplings and the cook who was making the pan fried ones went to the sink to wash her hands and then blow her nose next to the sink. Without any tissue, napkin, paper towel, nothing. Then rinsed her hands after. No soap. THEN one of the dumpling making ladies did the same. Gross!"}
{"text":"Delicious dumplings, cheap appetizers. Get the pork and dill dumplings and it'll give you fragrantly delicious dill breath all day (in a good way, your lover will thank you). Beef brisket noodle soup base is super salty, not a fan. Really casual environment, good for grabbing a weekday lunch or dinner. As long as it's not a sweltering hot summer day, it's pretty awesomesauce. There is no air conditioning here. They have an open kitchen, pots-a-boiling constantly creating steam and humidity. It's nightmarish to dine in here if it's already a disgustingly hot day. Points off for management refusing to install air conditioning!"}
{"text":"all 3 of us have sworn we're not coming back to this place.  the dumplings had very little meat inside them and the skin too thick.  we tried them pan-fried, boiled ( pork and chives) and steamed (xiao long bao).  the pan-fried and boiled dumplings i would describe as one-bite pieces since you put the whole thing in your mouth and still not feel like you're getting much meat.  i've had better dumplings prepared at home from store-bought frozen packages.  those at least gave us 2-bites worth of meat.  the xiao long bao at Asian Legend is better as at least the juice is still inside the dumplings.  these ones were called juicy on the menu but didn't have any soup left inside the dumplings. overall, we felt like we were just eating dough. the decor is much improved as there's now a bit of style and interior decoration compared to the hole-in-the-wall atmosphere at its previous location.  but style never trumps the food in our book."}
{"text":"Pretty good dumplings, a bit greasy but that's to be expected.  Tried the boiled, pan fried and steamed... all delicious.  Surprisingly good General Tao chicken."}
{"text":"pros: good selections of veggie dumplings, decently priced,  cons: bad service, inconsistent food quality and no visa machine."}
{"text":"Yum!  Stopped in here on a cold evening for a snack that turned into more of a meal because everything sounded so good.  The dumplings were perfect!  If you sit towards the middle of the restaurant you can see them being made as you eat.  My boyfriend and I ordered some steamed buns and chicken and mushroom dumplings, but realized when we bit into them that we got shrimp dumplings instead.  They were actually a nice surprise that we didn't think to order, and since they were so good we just ate them anyway.  The service was good and it felt nice and cozy and clean inside.  I left feeling full and happy."}
{"text":"Best dumplings in Toronto. A bit pricey but worth it.  The pan fried dumplings are my favourite, but the juicy pork buns are also great so long as they're not over cooked."}
{"text":"I love dumplings. Ordered 4 types of dumplings and 2 out of 4 dishes came out cold along with cold tea.   Not that special. Better choices elsewhere."}
{"text":"Xiao Long Bao - best in the city. Dumplings are decent, it really depends on the day you go.  Quick service. It's definitely a spot that I would choose in Chinatown."}
{"text":"I've just been to the new Mother's Dumplings location and have to say it wasn't bad but there's room for improvement.  The food was great. Really. We had steamed, boiled and fried dumplings and the steamed beef and chives were fantastic. The chili sauce is nice without being too spicy. The seaweed salad had way too much garlic in it and the smashed cucumber salad was nice and refreshing.  The seating in there is a mess. There are tables for four everywhere and most of them are taken up by one or two people which means you're probably lining up when you come in. This is partially because the kitchen staff just can't handle more than about 40 people at a time and partially poor planning. The people in line were more than happy to wait without any complaints.  if they could open up the dining area a little more and use the wasted space at the back I think this new space could be great. I guess they're still working the kinks out."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try out this dumpling spot mainly due to the raving Yelp reviews, some have even claimed this place to have the best dumplings in town. To be honest, I wasn't impressed and the food was a total let down.  We ordered the Juicy Pork Dumplings (steamed), Pork, Shrimp, and Melon (pan friend), and the beef spring onion wrap.   The pan fried dumplings were not very good, it came out on a plate upside down and all stuck together, it really reminded me of how I make my own at home, but I would expect better from a dumpling house. The skin was thick and extremely starchy overpowering the filling which just resulted in a bland taste.  The beef green onion wrap came out cold and the green onion pancake was kinda stale.  The juicy pork dumplings were my true test as I have had this at many places around the world. And sad to say it too was a disappointment, these dumplings should have a very thin skin showcasing the delicacy of the hand work that went into it. Not only that but they are suppose to be juicy meaning there is some soup inside the dumpling. When it came out I can see that majority of the juices had leaked through the dumpling when it was being steamed, also a sign that the skin is not very good. The result were dry dumplings.  My apologies to all the fans out there but this place did not impress and it certainly didn't warrant a second visit. My tip if you want Juicy Pork Dumplings and Beef Wrap, Asian Legend is the best spot to get these items in the area. It has even been confirmed by my finicky better half who is Taiwanese."}
{"text":"I really liked the fact that they have a good amount of dumplings per order making sure it fills you up. Most of the dumplings were very good but some like the beef with chives dumplings were not as good. The beef and chives ratio was 1:3. The chives would take over the meat and all u would taste is really the chives. Also it was a pricey in the end especially since they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Delicious food at reasonable prices. Our favourite is the leek and shrimp dumplings and the green onion potato pancakes. You won't be disappointed!   I would give Mother's Dumplings 5 stars except that Yelp blocks 5 star listings from small businesses that don't pay to unlock the 5 star ratings. Bad on Yelp for praying on small business owners, for this I am settling for 4 stars so that this review shows up."}
{"text":"Excellent shrimp,egg and chive steamed dumplings!"}
{"text":"Absolutely rubbish! Over hyped for sure! The dumplings are ok nothing great and service is really bad! We ordered two large portions of beef and shrimp dumplings, Chinese broccoli, kimchi fried rice and 5 spice beef and general Tao chicken. The food was served each at atleast 15 to 20 min interval and by the time the rice arrived, we had finished the side dishes! We had to repeatedly ask for cutlery and glasses. Not a pleasant dinner experience at all!"}
{"text":"*3.5*  Ever since I can remember I been eating my dumpringz, I been eating my dumpringz, I been eating my dumpringz  My grandfather is an excellent cook, as is my mother, so my childhood was filled with warm fuzzy memories of folding dumplings and feasting on them. Like every good Chinese kid knows, dumplings are a craft and each family passes along different flavours, ingredients, and secrets down the family tree. A dumpling dinner at a friend's house will always be different than a dumpling dinner at your parents'.  Mother does a good job of bringing back those joyful emotions with her Mandarin speaking servers and cooks, dark vinegar - which I am so SO fond of, and selection of comfort dishes which are traditional to the Chinese family (read: not the standard Westernized Chinese food). Her new location is great, really spacious and clean; and while you won't get your 5-star service and they struggle with bringing out food in a timely succession, the servers are present throughout the restaurant and will respond to your requests pretty quickly.  I've been here several times and I've been a fan of most of her dumplings. Her Pan-fried Bean Sauce Noodles (Zha Jiang Mian) is really excellent and I always order a plate of Watercress. I would advise to STAY AWAY from most of her side/cold dishes, they aren't very good. Neither is the Green Onion Pancake.  For those interested in having dumplings catered, we used to order from them to feed parties of 20 and she's always done a good job... and this is when she was in that little hole-in-the-wall location on Huron.  I will always turn to them for some authentic homemade dumpling happiness.  Atmosphere 2.5/5 Service 3/5 Food 4/5 Price 4/5"}
{"text":"I had heard about Mother's when it was still in the old location, but didn't make it into Toronto to try the dumplings until after they moved. I found it friendly and comfortable, and the food was unbelievably good. My husband and I shared the pork and dill dumplings, pork and radish cornmeal dumplings, and a scallion pancake. Every bite was exquisite; it was plenty of food for both of us; and it cost us $22 including a generous tip. Free jasmine tea.  I'm afraid we may never eat anywhere else in Toronto from now on."}
{"text":"We ordered a variety of dishes from their menu. We had the hot and sour soup, it really lacked flavour and it seemed watered down. The onion pancake was good, but not great.   We tried the juicy pork buns and pork with bok choy dumplings. They both seemed soggy, the dough itself was not that great.  Mother Dumplings in one word, mediocre."}
{"text":"I love dumplings. I would eat them everyday if I could.   I have my usual Scarborough joint that I hit up, but considering I was going to be downtown I decided to check out Mother's. This is supposedly where all the fancy celebrity chefs get their fix, and I wanted to see what the hype was all about.  The dumpling menu had 3 categories: Boiled, Steamed, and Pan-Fried. We skipped on the Boiled and indulged in the rest.  They were pretty yummy, though I found the fillings to be on the skimpy side. The table comes equipped with Soy, Black Vinegar, and Chili Oil. Mix those in equal quantities, and dip away son! You won't regret it.  On my way out, I noticed that many tables were eating the boiled variety. I think this might be the staple here. Major pangs of regret! Oh well, there's always next time."}
{"text":"I frequet mother dumpling for their good, cheap eats but this past weekend I had a horrible experience which left a bad taste in my mouth.   I was with two friends and we were sharing a bunch of plates. In the middle of our meal, as I was finishing the wonton soup, I started chewing on something really strange. I thought it was seaweed but when I pulled it out of my mouth, it was a dirty piece of plastic wrap. I told he waitress and she confirmed that the plastic was from the seaweed packaging. The manager/ head waiter at the time did not offer to do anything about it and was very rude. We had to ask for compensation which he was reluctant to give. In the end we got 50% off our meal but our experience was ruined.   I will not be returning to mother dumpling."}
{"text":"I will give them 2 stars for existing and being an option if u want to eat dumplings, but really, the food is getting horrible and the customer service is really bad. I think somehow over the past two years, they just stopped trying. It's a shame, they used to be good."}
{"text":"If you are from China, you won't like this place. Not authentic at all. Especially don't order the cold dishes - put too much sugar ."}
{"text":"Took the family on a Saturday afternoon. There's a wonderful variety of dumplings but not an overwhelming amount of choice. My eldest son really liked the bbq pork buns; my daughter loved the appetizer sized scallion pancake. We thought we had ordered too much but it was magically gone when it was time to go."}
{"text":"The interior of mother dumplings looks like my busto lower middle class apartment kitchen and dining room except for the fact that there at 5-6 Asian people cooking dumplings in there full time. The decor is not why they are hot, it is the amazing dumplings. You can choose from 18 kinds of dumplings fried or steamed with my favorite being fried pork & bak choi which create little mouth bak choi juice explosions when you pop them. They only give 1 small shoyu and hot suace w/ takeout orders regardless of order size so make sure to ask for extra."}
{"text":"This is truly Mother's dumplings cos it tastes very similar to what my mom makes! So authenticity check passed. My bf and I used to come here quite often since he has a regular craving for dumplings and we always order one boiled dumpling dish, one pan fried dumpling dish and the juicy pork buns. Delish! However, they raised the prices quite a bit and while it's good, we've found somewhere else just as good, cheaper and has a lot more selections! ;)"}
{"text":"My quest to find a place that serves good soup dumplings in Toronto continues, and Mother's dumplings is NOT it. The soup dumpling here is too salty and lacks flavor, the meat is also to \"grainy\", super disappointed. Dough was also too soggy.  The regular boiled shrimp with napa cabbage dumplings are great though, the boiled shrimp dumplings have a great dumpling skin, not too thick and has a bit of a chew, so for this it is more a 4 stars (could do with a bit more filling). The boiled pork dumplings are ok as well, but nothing to write home about.  Overall, from what I have experienced the boiled dumplings are pretty good but super disappointed in the soup dumplings (my fav type)."}
{"text":"Dumplings were just ok..... Too many chives in the pork and chive dumpling. Beef noodles with soup had little taste. Juicy pork dumplings were good."}
{"text":"Warning before you read this review, you must know I'm biased because I think my grandmother's dumplings are the VERY best in the whole world, which is why I have to rate this establishment a 2 star rating.  (I should mention here that my ancestry hails from Shandong-the dumpling and bao capital of China).  Boiled pork dumplings I found quite bland.  Even with my soy/vinegar dipping sauce I found them quite unintersting.    Chicken and mushroom dumplings were worse.   Pork pan fried dumplings were much better.  Skin had right amount of chew, meat inside had a nice flavour and it was the appropriate skin to meat ratio.    Pancake with green onion and beef was not authentic, came out looking like a fajita roll up with a few slices of thin beef instead of  a flaky sesame pastry stuffed with shredded beef and curls of green onion.    Dan dan noodles came a bit raw...I had a clump of raw dough in mine and chose not to finish.  Meat sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste but the rest of my dining crew happily finished the dish.    Soup dumplings-don't.  Out of a dozen, 2 had soup.  I think the other problem was that the filling was too large a ball of meat. Less meat, more soup=delicious soup dumpling.    So if you do go, try the fried dumplings and maybe go for the lamb dumplings or even veggie dumplings.  I think they have more potential for flavour.  Skip the soup dumplings and pancakes."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this restaurant for years, and quality has plummeted recently. The service is the absolute worst, where we waited an hour for our food, which did not come out fresh. The pancakes were dry and the soup dumplings had no soup inside. Do not waste your time or money here. The staff doesn't even care about this experience, and encouraged me to write this review instead of resolving this negative experience. WOW."}
{"text":"2 years later and you still make my heart swoon. Delicious boiled dumplings (more bang for your buck than the steamed) and the surprisingly delicious wonton soup. What's new since my last review? Menu remains pretty consistent, but check it out! There have been sightings of western (aka, um, not Chinese) servers and yes! Even cooks! Mother don't discriminate!  You continue to be my default spot for a meal that's cheap, cheerful, and that always hits the G-spot.   And that's G for \"goodness\"."}
{"text":"Dumplings are good, but it's definitely not the best in town. The chilli oil and food other than dumplings supplied are just so so."}
{"text":"the people that works there are a mess they dont even know the basic things towards serving customers..i and my family went there and there was a another big group AFTER us..but we had to wait for 10 mins for just getting us a table when there were 5 available tables there. the food wasnt good AT ALL. the restaurant is a Chinese restaurant, but they make the food like vietnamese and some different countries food -.- like this plate of noodles thing has vietnamese bun(rice noodles) and some vegetables fried together, im vietnamese and chinese. and i find it so ridiculous like making a new recipe is good, but this kind of way making it was awful and disgusting the dumplings was WORSE!! oh gawd the skin isnt soft, the stuff inside taste terrible and when i got it was like so watery,  JUST ONE WORD TO DESCRIBE THIS PLACE'S FOOD - EWW"}
{"text":"Prompt service, good dumplings.  Not a cheap lunch, but satisfying.  The lamb shui mai were a unique dumpling flavor experience, if you're into eating baby animals.  The chives and egg filled pancakes were good too.  Though when they refill your teapot, they reuse the same tea leaves. Come on, guys."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place  is so popular. Am I missing something?!?! Maybe we ordered the wrong items....  After readings all the great reviews on this place,I was excited to try this place . It was quite busy when we got there. We waited for 20 min, which is fine. Service was ok. Not great but not bad.  Once the food arrived, my husband and I stared at each other....thinking \"really? this is it?\"  Dumplings were bland. Soup was bland. It even looked bland!  I don't foresee myself going back..."}
{"text":"Very good Dumpling place!!! You have to go there! Prices are really ok, you get 10 dumplings for about $ 10 and they are so delicious!"}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan of this place. The soups we ordered were very oily (hot and sour & wonton) and the dumplings were nothing special because the fillings were a bit bland. It was pretty busy there, though, so maybe it was an off night?"}
{"text":"Decided to try Mother's Dumplings on weekday for lunch.  No surprise it was busy, people from all different ethnic backgrounds. Universal appeal it seems for this Chinatown establishment.  We got seated in about 5 minutes. We ordered the pan fried pork dumplings, pan fried green onion beef roll and lastly the dessert platter (variety of desserts)  pork dumplings - were decent - it's essentially the soup filled dumplings but fried. after having them, i'd suggest getting them traditionally steamed not pan fried.   pan fried green onion beef roll - a sloppy heavy cut beef, yucky super salty old hoisen sauce, packing a crudely cut green onion. what the hell was this?. this creation felt slapped together from a 2 year old. it sucked, get this dish from a real shanghai restaurant.   dessert platter - 5 stars, perfect all around. taste was spot on. it's worth just going here for this just this dessert platter.   the staff is taxed - about 3 people clearing/serving the tables front and back. makes it hard get their attention because they are always head down trying to retrieve orders.   the consistency was the real key for the so-so review because how can the dessert platter be upmost AMAZING but the pan fried green onion beef roll be so POOR?  i think it's due to the kitchen staff imho. there's different teams of people making different things.   the next day, i got terrible food poisoning stomach cramping and diarrea from here, (by the way i can eat most anything without even a slightest hiccup). kaopectate can't cure, moving onto cipro now..   i can see why it is popular but in some sense I question why?  it is NOT CONSISTENTLY good all around and i got food poisoning here.  No thanks."}
{"text":"After continually hearing hype surrounding Mother's, I caved in an hit them up with my gf. I found that although we were seated very quickly, there was a huge delay with taking our order and serving our order. We waited ~10 mins for the first and 20-25 mins for the latter. I understand that they are hand making their dumplings, but really 20 mins for both pan fried and steamed dumplings is excessive considering their competition at dumpling house doesn't seem to suffer this issue.  I found the food to be on the salty side and quite bland (salt used to cover up the lack of taste or did the salt cover up the subtle tastes...?) We ordered the pan fried onion pancake, pan fried vegetable dumplings, and steamed beef and greens dumplings.  Honestly I can not justify returning to mother dumplings when an alternative is located really close by which has better service and food."}
{"text":"The dumplings here are incredible and no trip is complete without taking a bag of frozen dumplings home for later. The Chive and Noodle dumplings are especially fantastic! Yeah sure it was more fun when it was this little hole in the wall gem but, you know what, good for them for expanding. The food quality hasn't gone down one bit so why complain? Can't fault them for success - it's well-deserved. The atmosphere is great and the prices are still reasonable."}
{"text":"Figured I would try this place out based on a recommendation.   Given the fact there are other similar type restaurants in the area, I'm not sure I would come back.    Service 2.5/5   We we promptly greeted and given our choice of tables.   The table was clean and we were given a Luke warm pot of green tea.  I was given a menu and a food check list to check off what we wanted to eat.  Unfortunately, after checking off our items, the servers failed to bring one of our dishes and really made no aplogies.     Food 3.5/5  Our order.  Hot and sour soup.  Steamed beef and Chives dumplings, fried pork and bok choy dumplings and shrimp fried rice.   While trying to sip the mouth puckering bitter green tea, our order arrived.    The hot and sour soup had little spice with little tang and high soduim.  Depending on where you go, this soup will vary on taste.  All in all, it was edible as long as you have a jug of water.     The steamed Beef and Chive dumpling were amazing.  They were tasty and juicy and hit the spot.    The pan fried  pork and bok choy were disappointing.  The were only fried on one side and it was burnt.  It's fair to say that bok choy was non existant in these dumplings.    The shrimp fried rice....waiting.....waiting.....waiting.    It never arrived.  Neither did our server.    Nonetheless, after piling our dishes on top of one another as an indication to come by our table, the server came to clean our table.   Check please and cancel the rice.  Price $24.26 lunch for two"}
{"text":"I went there last Thursday. The waiter misundertood my order, so I wait a long time to get my food. It is not quidk service even I come that is weekday and no rush hour.  Fire dumplings better than steam dumpling. I order a potato pancake which taste really awful. But the wonton soup is ok.."}
{"text":"The wait did not justify the food. The dill dumpling was one of the grossest things I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"A little pricey for what it is - if the dumpling plates were $5-6 instead of $7-8, this would be four stars and I'd be eating lunch here every day (to the detriment of my health). The food itself, though, is delicious."}
{"text":"On a brisk fall evening, a Thoisday to be exact. Sorry, sometimes I like to write 'Thursday' as 'Thoisday' because if you say it out loud it's quite fun to hear. Just a little chuckle to start this review.   It was a brisk fall Thursday, and I felt wild. I wanted to try something new, breaking free from my routine. I went into Mother's Dumplings for a late-night bite. I should have been in bed hours ago, but sometimes it's fun to eat at 8:30 pm. I was out on the town with all kinds of nightlife people, livin' life. The lights and sounds of the city this late at night was magical.   I entered Mother's Dumplings with a rumblin' tummy and was greeted by a very friendly server who asked, 'How many?'. I said 1, and he took me to my seat.   The first thing I enjoyed was a pot of white tea. I know, crazy, because drinking white tea this late at night would surly keep me up, and it did. But the tea was very good to begin my dumpling experience.   I looked to my right and saw the people making the dumplings. They were having a great time and were very quick and efficient at making these little, tasty treats.  I ordered 5 dishes. Pork and chive, a beef one, shrimp, a soup one, and another one. One-by-one they were brought to my table in steam boxes which is very fun and the only way to serve dumplings.     I couldn't believe the flavours that were dancing on my tongue. If I could compare it to an art form, I would say it was like tableau. The flavours would explode in my mouth and then freeze frame and hold me in a state of yummy bliss for minutes.   I ate all the dumplings and then was very full. I paid and said thank you. I put my jacket on and began to leave the restaurant.  As I was leaving, I couldn't help but think about how fleeting this moment was. Me, delicious dumplings, and my old friend the moon. Although it was very far past my bedtime, there was a beautiful lesson in this experience. Sometimes it's good to stray from the usual routine, you never know what you'll find, or should I say eat. Haha.  Your pal,  Mitch"}
{"text":"The problem with this place is that all those honkies like it.  Came here on Chinese New Year (how original) and it was SLAMMED. Took about an hour to be seated and two hours to finish the meal which came out in portions every 15 minutes or so. The dumplings were great though. In order to avoid the rush - make a reservation. No one makes reservations in Chinatown (that I know) - but they take them! So do that. It will be more fun for you.  Who knew you could have a whole meal of dumplings!? (Me.).  They serve other stuff, too.  ttyn, P"}
{"text":"Had pork & dill steamed and pork & bok choy fried and they were awesome.  Side of fried rice was pretty good.  Tried the dumpling soup but it wasn't really to our liking.  Dumplings were the star.  In from out of town and would definately go back."}
{"text":"J'ai besoin de faire le tour du menu avant de mieux évaluer. À la première impression, c'est pas mal du tout dans le style boulette chinoises."}
{"text":"mother's dumplings is obviously a well loved toronto favorite. my toronto friends have been talking about it for years, the signed postcards tacked up on the walls show that customers can't live without it..  and when you go on their website,, \" no longer does our restaurant look like a hole in the wall\".     we tried pork and chive (to compare against family dumpling house, who yes, have copied many many many (ok most/all) aspects of mother's dumplings.)  the vegetarian (bok choi, mushroom, tofu)  and the pork shrimp and mellon, pan fried.   the wait was long, the decor was spadina street fancy styles, the dumplings were not aaaas delicious as family house dumpling. its hard to say if other variables are responsible for this.. the skin was not as thin on the dumplings, which took away from the filling, the pork and chive often had a bit too much of a grassy flavor. but i will say the vegetarian were some of the most flavorful vegetarian dumplings ive eaten ever. they obviously know what they are doing. come here and get full on dumplings. its the right thing to do."}
{"text":"NOT FOR REAL ASIAN PEOPLE! The rice is basic and very small portioned. The dumplings barely come with any filling and the skin is weak and chewy. The dumplings already had holes on them when they arrived and break very easily once you pick them up. The food also took way too long (30-minute wait for my dumplings)  The lineups are also very long. I would NOT revisit or recommend if you want actually tasty real Chinese food.  OVERPRICED AND BAD"}
{"text":"This is one of those emergency restaurant along Spadina for students who can't eat greasy mysterious meat. I think the dumplings shell is too thick. Taste has definitely changed from 2 years ago. There seems to be more meat when I first came here two years ago, but right now whenever I order their pork&chives, I can only taste the chives. The Xiao Long Bao is pretty decent, although sometimes whenever it's a full house, it seems to be steamed too long and it pops and there's no soup left inside it? I love their dessert dimsum. It's an assortment of small and cute dumplings. The purple taro one is my favourite!"}
{"text":"Update - tried the General Tso Chicken and it was bad - seemed like it was bought from a grocery store and reheated in the back - super processed.  The dumplings were fine and good though - so I will stick with those in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent !!!! La nourriture est préparée avec amour soigneusement devant nos yeux par une famille chinoise !!!  Les plats sont riches en saveur et copieux. Le service est excellent.  À revenir pour plus de saveurs !!!!  Vraiment je conseille à tous le monde d'y aller !!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Mother's Dumplings for ages and finally got the chance while I was in the neighbourhood. I cannot believe how disappointing it was. I was dining alone around 3 pm on a week day so it wasn't super busy. Hostesses who were seating people were pretty gruff. My server was the same. The only nice server was the bus boy. Dumplings were worse than I could make at home (and I am not a great cook). My dumpling standards are pretty high as I have lived in Asia and my Chinese friends in Toronto are great cooks (and dumpling makers!) My food was so lacklustre and disappointing that I doubt I'll bother to give them a second chance. I definitely do not understand all the stellar reviews."}
{"text":"Come here for the soup dumplings, which aren't the best ones I've had, but are solid.  And you can get them at all in Toronto, whereas they seem to be missing here in Berlin.  Anyway, the bottom line is.  Soup dumplings: YAY!  Other dumplings: Yay! Scallion pancakes: ok.  Speed at lunch: reasonable.  So maybe it's all nostalgia, but 4 stars."}
{"text":"As a northeastern Chinese, whose specialty is to make dumplings, I recommend fellows to go to this lovely restaurant to taste the dumplings that are close enough to the classical Chinese dumplings.  The boiled and fried ones are more tasty than the steamed ones (for me). The pancakes are not quite good though.  It seems that they don't have air conditioner. It was so hot inside when I was there three days ago. It is actually pretty noisy there. So if you wanna a good place to talk, don not choose a dumpling restaurant. Lol."}
{"text":"Best dumplings in the city, can be busy at times."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Mother's Dumplings Cuisine: Chinese Location: Chinatown Address: 421 Spadina Ave Price Range: ~$10  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 2 Service: 1 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 2  Extra information:  *Specialize in Dumplings *Open for lunch at 11:30AM *Make their own dumplings  Mother's Dumpling is known for their dumplings in Chinatown. My family had already visited this place without me couple weeks back, and told me it was pretty decent so I decided to give it a try.    The restaurant is very big with random lounge looking sofas at the backside of the seating area.  Ordered: Smashed Cucumber 2/5  *plate of cold cucumber pieces with soy sauce for $3.79 *This is premade and very cold *It's good size for the price you are playing *They use regular cucumbers (not the Chinese kind, where it's smaller and thinner) *Because they use regular cucumber, soy sauce doesn't soak in entirely *Has strong cilantro, garlic and soy sauce but it just wasn't enough *Really good smashed cucumbers burst with flavor but this was just refreshing *If you are not used to chopsticks, you might have problem with this dish *Because cucumber pieces are quite big and slippery, it might be hard to pick up *I've used chopsticks all my life and I still found it a little difficult  Ordered: Xia Long Bao 2/5  *8 pieces of Dumplings with soup inside for $6.69 *Good Xia Long Baos have very thin skin with lots of soup inside, but it shouldn't rip when you pick it up *This had super thin skin so it was hard to pick up *They didn't give us spoons to eat this with *You are suppose to make a hole on the dumpling, dump the soup out onto the spoon, drink it and then eat the dumpling *Were they just expecting us to throw in the hot dumpling down our throat? *Asked for spoon twice and waited 10 minutes, it was just ridiculous *By the time we got our spoon, dumplings were cold and had already soaked up all the soup inside *Vinegar is provided on the table but it usually comes with ginger pieces in soy sauce.  Ordered: Pork and Bok Choy Pan fried Dumpling 3/5  *10 pieces for $7.59 *It comes steaming hot *Can't really taste the bok choy because the pork overwhelms the flavor *There was soup inside the dumplings, this was weird because it's pan fried *Be careful while eating them because the soup will squirt out *Dumpling skin is thick and sticky *For the sauce I added soy sauce, vinegar and chili oil  I only realized by the time I was leaving that it was 70% Non-Asians and 30% Asians at this place. To me that's usually a bad sign at Asian restaurants. I am not saying Non-Asians can't tell what's good/bad Asian food but it usually tells me that this specific restaurant is less likely to be authentic and caters to Non-Asians most of the time. Generally I can assume that the flavors and the recipe has been altered to be served  to those who are unfamiliar with Asian food.   Overall, the food was just mediocre but the service was unacceptable. Especially when they serve the type of food where it needs to be eaten while hot, slow service and miscommunication amongst employees are one of the worst things that can happen. All my food got cold and I was so angry by the time I left. I don't think I will be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Best dumplings in Toronto! I go every time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"Who you callin' a mutha? Oh - sorry.  I was born in Brooklyn.    The dumplings here are fresh and plentiful...but I just didn't find them as rave-worthy as other reviewers have.  They're tasty, reasonably authentic and whenever anyone asks to catch up here I don't automatically steer them to another place.  They are not the dumplings of legend.  Not the dumplings that make you order a few dozen to go after you've snarfed the third one.  Not the dumplings you crave in the soup you wish you'd made the night before on a caustically cold Toronto night.  Sorry fans - These are not THOSE dumplings.  The boiled dumplings have an overly water sloshy quality to them - in my opinion in excess of the generally accepted parameters established by the IDDI (International Dumpling and Dim Sum Institute).    The veggie dumplings are really good, but every time I've been there they only have one type available.    The steamed pork and chive are very nice - the juicy pork bun was excellent.  There are some decent picks on the menu; I've found flashes of flair in some of the other food items.  The sweet apple salad is tasty - my dining companions have loved it - although i felt it could benefit from a bit of heat (easily fixed table side) and that it got a bit cloying at the halfway mark.  I liked the green onion pancake, but others were put off by the fact that it was a bit crunchier than they were used to.  Everyone agreed that they hit a winner with the cold tofu noodle salad - just the right notes of sesame oil and the perfect sense of chewiness - actually, we ALL took one of those to go...  Worth a shot? Yes.  Worth your undying loyalty? Not at this time."}
{"text":"I love Mother's Dumpling!  I have been here a number of times with different people. I like dim sum in general, and the concept of trying all different kinds of things. What makes Mother's Dumplings perfect is how you can do it so deliciously, and for so cheap!  I have shared a number of dishes with others- my favourites are the chicken mushroom boiled dumplings. Also notable are the pan fried pork and bok choi, and the green onion pancake. The wonton soup was good as well. The only thing I didn't like was the boiled egg- the sauce that it was in didn't appeal to me, but I feel like the whole point of dim sum is trying new things every time!  I will go here again for sure, and would recommend it to anyone looking for dim sum! (We have always gotten decent service as well, but it does get VERY busy- it's not a very well kept secret!)"}
{"text":"I drop by this place when I have a hankering for Northern Chinese-style dumplings. Some think their food is too salty, I think it's perfect esp. with some vinegar and spicy sauce.  I usually order the steamed melon dumplings, juicy pork buns (actually they're dumplings oozing with hot pork juice/soup), a side of veggies (seaweed, crushed cucumber or the sampler) and some steamed veggie buns to go.  Conveniently located in Chinatown and good for chatting loudly while stuffing your face with dumplings.  You can have your steamed or boiled dumpling order fried for an extra dollar. Just ask your server because this option isn't on the menu (at least the last time I checked)."}
{"text":"In LOVE !!    I am currently obsessed with Mother's Dumpling. Always pass by and never found a reason to stop by. I mean, its dumplings. My mom makes dumplings. How can one place just sell dumplings.   So i did it. I dropped by and it was packed! We were quickly seated since it was just the two of us. We sat down and was quickly served water and was given the menu along with a menu sheet. Which makes ordering so much easier. Very much like those dim sum places. You write down how much of what you want. No miscommunication.   There is a middle part of the restaurant where it was kind of a \"open kitchen\" concept. There were clear windows and you can see the dumpling chefs make the little pockets of sunshines! It reminded me of home, seeing my mom and grandma gossiping while making happiness.   Their dumplings were divided into categories. Steamed, boiled, and pan fried. There were also soups, appetizers, and main dishes.   We ordered steamed chive and pork dumplings and panfried shrimp and pork dumplings. On the table there were your sauces! The sou sauce, vinegar, hot sauce, chili oil paste and etc.   Our dumplings came and omgahhh it was so good!! You can tell you were having the most authentic dumplings Toronto has to offer.   I was so happy with my experience there, I brought my cousins there the following week!   If you want some authentic dimplings, a taste of china, come here. You wont be disappointed.   Happy Belly :)"}
{"text":"We drove from Michigan and on a search for home made dumplings. Overall food was just so...so... But! What made it one star simply is because of the service. They are un-willing to accommodate, even a simple question is respond with a \" I can't\", basically you have to ask for everything. Excuse, can I have one more setting, can I have napkins, excuse me ...excuse me... Rough way to operate a business."}
{"text":"I always order waaaaay too much at Mother's Dumplings. I guess that means I like it. They have three vegan dumpling options that are all delicious. Service is what you'd expect at a fairly inexpensive, very busy restaurant. Efficient, not particularly friendly, but that's totally fine. They get the job done. On a few occasions, the wrong order has been sent to my table, and they usually realise before we've even had a chance to accidentally eat meat. Only once has someone from our party ended up eating a meat-filled dumpling, and it was because we were dining with omnivores, and a few of their pork dumplings were mixed in with our chive ones. They staff were very apologetic. Only complaint is that they sometimes run out of certain items, but it's not all that surprising at such a busy place."}
{"text":"Food was a-ok. Lots of selection to choose from and the flavours were quite authentically Chinese.   Siu Long Bao was delicious and very juicy!   My only quip is that it's expensive for dumplings, but I'm comparing to suburb prices. And I know that Chinatown Spadina strip is more expensive. But all in all, I would come back."}
{"text":"Terrible!! Don't waste your money and time. The service was extremely slow even though there were only 3 occupied tables. The remainder tables were dirty... One was not cleaned up the whole time we were there.  The steamed rice came after we ate our meal...  The meal was nothing special... There are way better places nearby that are also way cheaper."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place while i was walking down town and all the Yelp stickers on the door really drew my attention and i decided to have a snack here.   I came during an odd time, like 4 pm on a Tuesday? It wasn't busy there was about 5 tables of 2-4 people including me. The menu is standard. As the restaurant name suggests, they specialize in dumplings. They have boiled, steamed, and pan fried dumplings. My fav are pan fried dumplings so i decided to order that. It was about $10 for 9 dumplings. It's a little pricey for the amount that you get. The dumplings were pork and bok choy. It was tasty, but not out of this world.   I was actually very disappointed in the speed of service. It took 20-25 mins from when i ordered to get actually get my dumplings. I would recommend coming here for the food, but if you're in a rush i wouldn't come here."}
{"text":"My favourite there is the juicy pork (?) steamed dumpling. Their vermicelli salad is quite tasty as well!  But overall, I found the dough is a little too thick for my liking."}
{"text":"How does this compare to my own mother's dumplings? It can't compare. But it was still worth a try to see what this place was about.   We arrived just before the dinner rush, and were able to be seated immediately. The decor is tacky Chinese-with red lanterns hanging throughout the restaurant.   Just wanting to grab a snack, we shared 12 of the bok choy and pork boiled dumplings. I'm assuming that the dumplings are made to order so we had to wait a bit before the food arrived.   Then, a heaping plate of freshly boiled dumplings arrived. I was pretty excited to try it out, getting myself prepared with the soy, vinegar, and the sriracha. Dipping the dumpling into the sauces, I took a bite.   The skin wasn't too thick, the filling was flavorful, and there was also a bit of soup within. The pork wasn't too fatty, but there was a lack of bok choy, which I would have preferred to have more of. These weren't the best dumplings I've ever had, but they were good.   So, whenever you're craving dumplings, it's surely the perfect comfort food on a cold winter day."}
{"text":"Dumplings were excellent. The place needs a bit of dusting and they need to check the tea cups before using them.  My tea cup had lipstick marks. The waitress was nice and changed it for me."}
{"text":"Dumplings are THE item you should order,  everything else will likely be a disappointment,  especially if you enjoy typical dim sum fare.  We had pan fried versions of the dumplings, they were terrific. Good amount of fill, freshly prepared in open kitchen,  good balance of flavors  Congee was near bland, needed salt. Pork buns werent flavorful, didnt have balanced proportions of meat versus the bao. Also, dumplings are only served in quantites of 10plus, rendering tastings of multiple options in a small group to be tedious."}
{"text":"If you are hunting for a cheap hole-in-the-wall authentic Asian eatery, this place isn't one of them (well it's cheap, that's about it).  The first thing we noticed is that we were the only Asian people in the joint.  It's just weird feeling being in a dumpling house that has no Asian people!    We ordered one of the pancake items, pan fried pork and bok choi dumplings, and steamed pork dumplings with chives.  Our food took a damned long time. Long enough that the table next to us got up to abruptly pay not waiting for their last course.  The dumplings were a disappointment.  Maybe our expectations were too high... or we're just picky about dumplings!  1) Flavorless.  Bland...just bland. 2) Doughy and thick.  Bleh.   3) Ugly.  Not assembled with care, edges weren't crimped nicely.   We were disappointed and most likely will never return. ...and I hate those stupid red paper lamps."}
{"text":"Last night at around 10 pm, we walked into Mothers Dumplings to find that they we're closed. Fortunately they weren't! So we strolled in, boy! 24 pieces for 10 bucks! can't complain! Anyways, the dumplings were very well made and very juicy. I'm more of a pan fried bao person, but this was very delicious. The service was great and the price was affordable and it was very filling! Definitely something I will miss when I head back to the states! So if your from Toronto or visiting Toronto. I highly recommend this place for the steamed, but if you want pan fried! The Dumpling house is definitely where it's at! They make everything fresh and that's the way I like!"}
{"text":"Good stuff!! We ate a lot of dumplings...especially the juicy pork one!! The service was great and we were not an easy group: Children and people coming and going but they looked after us well!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite dumpling spot in the city. At peak times it can be quite busy but their service is usually pretty speedy. I highly recommend the vegetarian chive and noodle dumplings as well as the green onion pancake. Pricing is also very reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm traveling by myself and they tell me no table for me that's fine. Told me I have to wait for long Time to get any food... Cash and Canadian debit card only... They took only 10% off paying US dollar, well Canadian dollar to us is 8 to 10. I walked around and come back picked up my dumplings. Some part of beef still raw. This isn't steak right? And there's no fork no chopstick nothing at all, am I suppose to eat with hand?"}
{"text":"i hate to dump on mother, but this meal was gross!!  i first asked if they had the soup dumpling (long stare) nope they don't have those?  so i spelled xiao long bao on napkin, yep they had them.  You would think  the dumpling your most famous for would  resonate with the server.  ok got those and chicken chive dumpling and a seafood noodle soup.  took 45 minutes, we were the only ones there? the dumplings were mushy and the seafood soup had no seafood and very bland.  The vinegar on table was \"off\"  it wasn't that lovely red kind, it was a dark one.  Didn't go well with any of the mushy dumplings.  the food, service and the cleanliness of the space was soooo much to be desired.    $30 tax and tip in.  felt like i was raped.  those frozen ones you do at home from T & T taste better."}
{"text":"Totally overrated. Dumplings feel overcooked so the dough feels mushy. You can easily make dumplings at home that taste better and cost you a fraction of what they charge"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past few years and I'm sad to say the quality has been dropping as of late. The steamed dumplings have quite a thick skin and the beef and celery ones taste like sausages. The onion pancake is thick and doughy and the appetizers used to be spicier but now they're weak. So these are northern style dumplings so they're not as fine as Shanghai or Cantonese food but I didn't expect them to be so flavorless when I went last week. I don't think I'll come back for another year."}
{"text":"I really like Mother's Dumplings.  The 'egg and chives' pancakes, the 'beef and celery' boiled dumplings and the 'shrimp and egg' steamed dumplings are my favorites.  The pancakes come in a serving of four and for the dumplings you have an option of choosing to order a serving of 12 or 24 dumplings.  I normally order the smaller portion of 12, and this is more than enough food to satisfy a meal for two average sized people.    I just wished they offered pan fried dumplings with something other than pork filling, as I don't eat pork : / ... one star off for this.   Mother's dumpling is a yummy, very reasonable and clean dumpling house that I will always go to to get my dumpling fix."}
{"text":"This is not the authentic Chinese dumping at all, at the best is very westernize, did not even finish my order, will not come back again."}
{"text":"Juicy pork buns ( Chinese soup dumplings) were amazing... melts in your mouth. Service was very confusing."}
{"text":"We came here after reading the yelp reviews on Day 2 of our Toronto escapades, and you do not disappoint yelpers! Thanks for the heads up!  Ambiance: this is actually one of the nicest dumpling houses I have been to - softer, wooden decor, but ambiance is not as important to me   Food: By far the best thing we had - PAN FRIEND DUMPLINGS - get these. The soup dumplings were very good, but weren't as soupy as I'm usually used to. I really enjoy biting into the dumpling and getting a gush of soup (I know, sounds....interesting....o.o) and that's not really the experience here, but still tasty. We also ordered the green beans, also very tasty (but be warned, salty), and I would recommend  Service: very attentive servers and we were seated quickly on Saturday a bit before lunch time.   be warned: they accept US cash, Canadian cash, or Canadian debit. If you're have US dollars, they won't exchange, but will give you a 10% discount, so really you want to change your money  definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Beautifully executed small juicy pork buns and boiled dumplings.  Ask for some ginger and put some vinegar with your soy sauce and hot paste.  You will enjoy the full but not sickly so feeling afterward."}
{"text":"This place is definitely the place to go for dumplings!  We tried a bunch of dumplings and I liked them all except for one... now I don't remember its name but it had radish.  Except for that one... the rest were pretty good. They give you a long list and you get to tick the ones you want (like a sushi place).   The service is quick and efficient but don't go biting into the dumpling as soon as they place it on the table or you will leave with a burnt tongue."}
{"text":"JUICY PORK BUNS. This is the reason I return to Mother's Dumplings. They make a good plate of juicy pork buns (some of you may know them as xiao long bao or soup-filled buns/dumplings, etc).  Like many who have posted reviews before me, I frequented Mother's Dumplings when they were still on Huron. Since the move, I've been to the new location twice, both for lunch (12pm and 1pm, respectively). It's true what you've heard: the wait time (after you've placed the order) is sometimes almost unbearable. But since my friends and I love the food so much, we wait. It's worth it to us.  The service is also hit and miss. They are exceedingly friendly! But sometimes forgetful and yes, sometimes a dish takes longer than the rest of the orders to come. But like everyone else has mentioned, every dish is made to order. At the old location, it was because there were only one or two people in the kitchen. At the new location, it may have to do with newer hires and getting used to the new kitchen.   As for the atmosphere, it's a lot bigger (obviously) and brighter than the location on Huron. But I'll be honest - if the food is good enough, and on top of that, a really good price, I don't care if the place is a dive. As long as it's clean - and both locations fit that bill.  I should mention that my friend is vegetarian and she never has a problem choosing off this menu - there are a lot of options. We also love to share the Eggplant Stir-Fry dish: Eggplant, sweet bell peppers, onions and a lovely brown sauce.   In the end, we love the food, so we keep returning. If you're hungry or in a rush to get back to work, I would suggest choosing some place else to eat. But if you've got some time and just love to have home-style dumplings, this may be a good place for you."}
{"text":"The dill dumplings were interesting, not a flavor I am used to with food but I think I would try them again.  We went very close to closing time so I didn't have a chance to try much or remember much. Great soup dumplings though."}
{"text":"I am on the hunt for Shanghainese soup dumplings (???).   Having had them at Din Tai Fung and Asian Legend (Commerce Gate and Markham locations), I was eager to try the highly rated Mother's Dumplings in Chinatown, and would have been more than happy to walk to Chinatown for my xiaolongbao fix rather than commute for 2 hours to Markham every time I had a hankering for some.  Unfortunately, Mother's Dumpling was a complete let down!  The soup dumplings were tiny, dry, and the taste was overpowered by the excessive use of ginger.  The consistency of the dough was too tough, and the size of the dumplings were just pitiful.  They looked, tasted, and had the texture of frozen dumplings. Why pay $7.29 before taxes ($8.25 after tax, and $8.90 with a 10% tip) for 8 pathetic little dumplings when you can go to No Frills and buy the frozen ones for $1.77.  Trust me, they're much better than what Mother's Dumplings is offering.  On top of that, Mother's Dumplings actually cost more than both Asian Legend and Din Tai Fung!  I'm less upset about the quality of the dumplings than the fact that there aren't any decent soup dumplings south of Finch.  The hunt for some downtown xiaolongbao continues.."}
{"text":"Very average dumplings. Cold noodles were underwhelming. The place had too bright of lighting, was a bit sloppy, and, worst of all, our barhop wasn't even Asian! That's when you know you're not getting authentic dumplings. So in terms of flavor and value, I have but one thing to say. Move along, nothing to see here."}
{"text":"Walking down Spadina Friday night after an intense workout. Decided to pop into Mother's Dumplings since it looked busy (which must mean it's good) and we were starving. We were lucky enough to snag the last table for two. We order quite a lot of food for two people and ended up taking some home. We ordered the beef steam buns, bbq pork buns, general tao chicken, beef with broccoli and pork and chives steamed dumplings. Everything came out hot and fresh. Our favourite item was the bbq pork buns. The dough was very tender and fluffy with delicious pork stuffing. Our second favourite was the general tao chicken. The sauce was perfectly spicy and did not over power the dish. Service was very quick. We were in and out in about 40 minutes. Total cost with a coke and beer came up to $60.00. All in all a great spot for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Been here many times, food is good, nothing to complain about the service and ambience is ok.   Do they serve the best dumplings in the city........given my limited exposure to dumplings, will leave it up to you to decide :)  Repeat: Yes."}
{"text":"Good for a quick lunch.  Food is a bit on the greasy side, but it is tasty and cheap!"}
{"text":"Compared to other dumplings, I have to agree that Mother's are different.  The dough is chewier and the steamed buns have that same thick, chewy quality. So, two thumbs up for the outside of the dumplings. However, the inside of the dumplings don't keep up.  The greyish mushroom, cabbage and tofu filling is lacking in flavor and looks like it needs some color.  The same filling is inside the steamed vegetarian buns. For those pork eaters, I'm sure this is a great place.   Sorry to Mother's to downgrade the average rating, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked."}
{"text":"The place is spacious, bright and clean with a good atmosphere.  The bathrooms are even surprisingly clean for a place in Chinatown!  Being able to see the cooks do their thing through the large glass panels is a treat as well.  Unfortunately, the dumplings are average in my opinion.  They are of good size, but lacks taste from my sampling of 6 kinds of dumplings. This is coming from some with a lifetime of experience of eating dumplings locally and from Asia.    The good thing about this place is that they make their dumplings fresh and designed specific to they way they are to be cooked - boiled, steamed or pan-friend.  By this I mean, they make the boiled dumplings thicker to withstand the boiling water and longer endings so they don't unravel in the water.  Great attention to detail!  The pan-fried dumplings are put together to allow it to fry evenly on three sides.  While not overly oily, are just not fried in enough to be crispy on both sides."}
{"text":"The only dish that was good was the pork & chive boiled dumplings.  We had the juicy pork buns and they were just alright.  We also ordered the seaweed salad, tofu strip salad, and hot & sour soup. All of these were not good and lacked depth, all I tasted was soy sauce.  We also ended up with upset stomaches so we will definitely never come back or recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening with my sister and we were the only diners in the restaurant. I had previously been to their first location on Spadina so I knew what to expect. I am glad they opened up another location that is more convenient for me to get to.   The service was great once they were finished dealing with the take out orders. We were brought a menu and wrote down everything that we wanted. We ordered the green onion pancakes because other reviewers said it was good, and it was. For dumplings we ordered the pan fried pork and bakchoi, the boiled Pork and Dill, the steamed BBQ Pork Buns and the steamed Juicy pork buns. Everything came pretty quickly as you would expect. The pork and dill dumplings were good, but were very dill filled so the flavour was overwhelming. The BBQ pork buns were very doughy and it would be nicer if they had a bit more pork filling.   I have to say this was a little ambitious for two people so we left very full and satisfied, but got to try a lot of their menu. From this experience, my favourite continues to be the fried dumplings because you can never go wrong and now the juicy pork buns. I will definitely return to get my fix when I get another dumpling craving."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday and it was fairly busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table. We ordered a hot and sour soup, a wonton soup, and kimchi which I thought were all good. As for the dumplings, we ordered the pan fried pork and bok choi and the steamed shrimp, egg, and chives. The shrimp dumplings were good but they kept falling apart. My favourite was the pan fried dumplings because I love gyoza for the added texture. I mixed soya sauce and the chili oil together for a tasty dipping sauce for the dumplings. Overall, I want to go back, but with a group of people so that I can try a lot more of their dumplings."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on Yelp I was exciting to try Mothers Dumplings and ordered take out yesterday for myself and a co-worker. To my dismay, I was surprisingly  disappointed.  Here is what went wrong:  ~ The dumplings did not wow me but rather 'meh'  ~ There were barley any shrimp in my shrimp dumplings and WAY too many, and large unpleasant chive chunks (I felt I was just eating chives and random pieces of noodles the entire time)    -1 star  ~ The service was terrible! When I went to pick up the food, I was a little alarmed that the dumplings I ordered were in a green wrapping (boiled shrimp, chive and egg) so I preceded to ask the man who gave me my food if they were what I had ordered.  However, he pretended he did not know English or what I was asking him about! This was bothersome because not 2 min before he was speaking English not only to ME but to the gentleman in front of me paying    -1 star  ~ I had a horrible stomach ache after and felt terrible for the remainder of the day -1star  Overall, I had my expectations crushed in a bad way. Being a dumpling place on Spadina I will definitely be going somewhere else next time. It may take me a while to want to give this place another try..."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment, our favorite  hole in the place now seems so institutionalized.  Forget about decent service, our orders came out within 10 minutes of each other.  :(  Our steamed pork & chives had a very thick and unpleasant dough that stuck to each other when pulled against.  The pan fried was slightly better.    I read the reviews, but I still wanted to try it again for myself in hopes that it wasn't as bad as people had mentioned."}
{"text":"Best dumpling in the town. But need to maintain more clean . The best Ashton smells terrible. But service is good however wait time is bit longer."}
{"text":"Tried this place once in its old location on Huron St.  Thought it was ok.  It's simple homey north Chinese food.  Not exactly mind-blowing stuff as I found everything a little bland and unexciting although there were some highlights.  My favourite was the green onion pancake as the herbal-y taste of the green onions really added some nice flavour to this dish.  The pork and dill dumplings were fine, as were pan fried ones.  The biggest disappointment were the dalu noodles as I found it to be a bowl of heavy bland eggy mess.  I found everything to be really heavy and I found both the noodles and dumplings somewhat difficult to digest.  But if you're a fan of this type of cuisine, it's probably one of the better options in the city."}
{"text":"Have been there every once awhile in the past couple years, always have good dumplings (both steam & fried ones are great). Always get your delicious dumplings fast, fresh & hot. If you go during the dinner hours, you probably have to await for a bit until you get a table."}
{"text":"The food here is great, but the service is not. You will definitely wait to get a table, and because the place refuses to staff more than two people at a time, you'll end up asking the same server for water 15 times before s/he finally hears what you're trying to say. We had to get up to ask for the check. It was ridiculous.   Food recommendations: obviously get dumplings; pork and chives are solid--had the shrimp and egg ones and they were just okay. You should also get the fried green beans! Whoa! So delicious. Would definitely like another order of these. The green onion pancake was alright as well. Overall, I would give this place four stars if they decided to hire a few more people on the floor. But if you're like me (hangry and impatient), you'll hate the hoops you have to jump through to get some damn dumplings in front of you.   Shrug. Maybe you should UberEats this place instead--at least you can see where your food is."}
{"text":"I ordered a noodle soup, green onion pancake, different kinds of dumplings and sesame balls.  The dumplings were very juicy and good. The noodle soup and pancake were so so.  The sesame balls were average."}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed dim sum whore, how could i not like MD?   http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ginger-and-onion-cuisine-markham#hrid:js7gMZldzBTtMqe08uFmTw  I had never been to the old location, but I wish I had. I've read/heard about this restaurant for years now and saw it come up on many top 10 and top 50 lists over the years. I was so happy when I finally got to go, the experience was good overall, but I could tell when I walked in this is not the same \"hole in the wall\" place I read about, and that's truthfully where I wanted to eat.   Dumplings we began ordering! Overall I prefer the texture which results from the steaming process, I found the boiled ones to be a little bit sloppy and slightly unappealing. Of the boiled we tried the pork and chives and the pork and dill. The chives dumpling was solid, but again I wasn't crazy about the texture in comparison to steamed. The dill dumplings were completely overpowering and we couldn't even finish them, there was so much dill stuffed in there I couldn't eat more then a few.   Of the steamed dumplings we got the beef and chives and the juicy pork bun. OH MYYYY, these two were solid but def the juicy porn bun stole the show. I could eat 100 of those, the explosion of hot perfectly seasoned pig juice in my mouth was unreal.   I also tried a green onion pancake as well as some kimchi. The green onion pancake was ok, I think it was a bit overcooked because it was fairly hard. The kimchi was clearly fresh, but definitely the most unimpressive kimchi I have ever have. I swear by kimchi and this one was lacking that punch/pop/snap/kick that kimchi is all about, I would never order it again, in fact ever since I had it at MD I've been hard fiending a good bowl of it.   Overall I had a good experience. I was not impressed by the crimping job on the dumplings at all, I believe when you make dumplings there is a certain level of finesse that is associated with the presentation in the dumpling. I guess they were banging out way too many to put the time into it, but really there should be no excuse. Although I have a fair amount of negative ish to say, the dumplings that I did enjoy were incredible.   I will be back. Juicy pork bun all day.    XIAOLONGBAO!"}
{"text":"Food are not bad. Only thing is waiting time is sooooooo long! I've been there for two times, first time was eat in and second time was takeout. Both I've ordered fire dumplings and it just made you to wait for more than 25 mins to get your food. You may died if you are starving"}
{"text":"- not known for service. - very well known for dumplings. - try the dill and pork dumpling. pretty dang tasty. - liked the old location better from back in the day."}
{"text":"momma knows child, momma knows  I LOVE DUMPLINGS!  Of course, my mother's dumplings are infinitely better.  But that is because my mother is the best.  There is no one like my mother and thus, there is nothing like her dumplings. You would love my mother too.  She creates happiness in the kitchen.  But this is not about my mother.  This about Zhen's mother, and I like her dumplings.  They're homemade pockets of comfort.  Greasy, but very tasty.    They moved locations a while back to a shiny and new place right on Spadina, south of College.  Normally I like shiny, but would it be so wrong if I preferred the dingy basement on Huron?  Because I did.   In any event, they still serve a long list of different dumplings - steamed, boiled, and fried.    My personal favourites are these babies: Fried - Pork & Bok Choy - $6.95   My sister LOVED this: Pancake - Chives & Egg - $5.49   And we all enjoyed these: Steamed - Juicy Pork Bun - $6.10   If you have a fried dumpling fix.  Go to Mother's Dumplings to squash it."}
{"text":"The place gets busy on a Friday.I would recommend the beans side dish,chives egg shrimp boiled dumplings and the pan fried ones are a must try.The service is average,a typical chinatown restaurant vibe but not so pricey food"}
{"text":"My go to restaurant every time I'm in Toronto.  Hand made dumplings that you can see being put together.  So of course you might have to wait a little bit, but it's worth it.  Try one plate of boiled (i.e. spring,pork, egg & chives), steamed (i.e. beef and celery) and pan fried (i.e. pork, shrimp and melon) dumplings for variety's sake.  That is 32 dumplings in three different varieties for two people that comes to around $25 all in.  Throw in a green pancake for good measure if it isn't enough.  The new larger location doesn't have the same kind of  homey hole-in-the-wall feel to it, but on the bright side the ventilation is better so your clothes don't smell like dumplings afterwards."}
{"text":"Dumplings! They're delicious. I make my own at home all the time, but with store-bought wrappers, so I was keen to taste the fresh-made variety from a real dumpling house. Enter Mother's. It looks small and grubby from the outside, but inside is a spacious dining room that looks right onto the kitchen where you can see the staff rolling and packing and crimping the dumplings right in front of you - a nice touch!  I'm most partial to steamed dumplings, and ordered some of the pork and chive variety as well as some vegetable ones. A green onion pancake and a couple of steamed red bean buns rounded out the meal. They let you mix and match dipping ingredients to suit your taste at the table, but there's no delicious pale pink vinegar (my favourite dumpling condiment!) available.  Unfortunately, as the dumplings are made fresh, the food took a while to arrive. There's little in the way of service to speak of, either: you get your teapot, you get your order card, and then you fend for yourself.  The onion pancake made for a pretty good, if salty, snack. It was piping hot and not too greasy, and nicely crisp on the outside, but noticeably mushy inside when it could have been flakier. It did come with lots of onion filling, though.  The dumplings were very well done, as I had hoped they would be at a place called \"Mother's Dumplings.\" You really can taste the just-rolled freshness of the dough and there's plenty of tasty filling in each morsel - it's great, but I wish that the wrappers were a bit thinner, as when fresh like this they seem to have a slightly doughier texture and taste that's made more noticeable by the thicker wrapper. They do arrive very hot, though, and you have to be careful not to burn your mouth as you might be eager to start eating after waiting for the food to arrive. I would suggest letting them cool a bit - the flavour of the filling is more noticeable that way.  I was torn as to how to feel about the steam buns. I love red bean, and the filling was spot-on, but the bun itself was bland - it feels like there's a lot of bun and not a ton of beans. It had a wonderful pillowy texture when eaten right away, but turned flat and chewy by the time  I got around to the second bun.  Give Mother's a visit if you want exactly what it says on the sign, made fresh, in clean and casual surroundings - and you don't mind waiting. They serve good food but are hampered by their inability to nail the little things, and the service doesn't do the food justice."}
{"text":"I've visited this place a few times now but I just wanted to put a warning out to vegetarians: be careful they don't fuck up your order and feed you meat dumplings!! I like this place because the dumplings are made onsite and it's cheap but today was a bit off putting. 20 years of being a vegetarian only to have a bite of a meat dumpling was a little gross.  The service was pretty crappy. The guy seemed pretty inept and got overwhelmed when we ordered tea. They could've not charged me for that dish for fucking up. It's a little disconcerting because what if I had a seafood allergy and they accidentally served me a seafood-filled dumpling?  So vegetarians and people with allergies, be careful! Maybe cut that little packet open before you dig in!"}
{"text":"Mother's dumplings is a good low key place to grab a quick dinner or lunch. What it lacks in romance (and decor) it makes up in the ability to people watch hipsters. The dumplings are good. Not blow you away good, but consistently good. I do wish they had a vegetarian pan fried dumpling option however, as I often visit here with my veggie friends, and they only offer steamed and boiled vegetarian options. The dessert tray is visually delightful (but was slightly chewy the one time I ordered it.) I'd order it again though.  A double order of vegetarian dumplings (20) plus a green onion pancake was decent for lunch for  two. Cost (with complimentary tea) was just over $23 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"Went to mothers dumplings on a recent trip to toronto.  There were lots of small places to stop in and eat before reaching it but google maps had it popped up.  Signs on the door make it look like a tourist trap which normally means it's overrated.  And it was.  I had fried pork dumplings BBQ buns.  Not bad not great.  I would recommend walking two blocks over to kenningston market."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!   The dumplings are made fresh! And boy, are they delicious. I've tried steamed and pan fried dumplings. Both were so delicious and fresh.   The pan fried dumplings do have a bit more saltiness and flavour but I just love a good boiled dumpling!   The green beans were just amazing salty goodness!   The chines broccoli was a bit bland. Most places will make them super garlicky, salty and greasy... here there was barely any garlic, so it tasted a bit more bland, but probably healthier that way anyway.   They have a couple of beers on tap and a few more to select from in a bottle!   Service is super quick. I'd come back here for dumplings any day!"}
{"text":"As previous reviewers noted, this is more for round eyes (like me). Dumplings were okay but lacked the flavour and oomph i want in Chinese food. Some disappointment in non-dumpling fare. Yes, clean and cheap - but need more bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Of course, best dumplings in the city. I believe I've tried everything here and everything other than the dumplings are generic, but I don't know if it's the atmosphere, my lack of dumpling culture or my level of intoxication, but their dumplings are out of this world. I have not ever, one day, had slow or bad service, or sub-par dumplings.  Again, all else is up for discussion, but the dumplings are not!"}
{"text":"I like Mother's dumplings, but I have had better. It's one of those places that does some things well, and some things...not so much. Nonetheless, it's a decent enough spot for a quick dumpling fix.   The service is friendly enough, but generally tends to be very slow. All the dumplings are fresh and made in-house. You'll see the lady behind the glass panel working away at your dumplings (or likely someone else's) while you wait. The fillings are tasty for the most part, especially the lamb and pretty much anything they serve with a pork filling. My main gripe is with the \"juicy pork buns\" (aka soup dumpling/xiao long bao), which always seem to burst at some point between the steaming process and before arriving to your table. In fact, I can say that every time I have visited Mother's, they are incapable of putting together a xiao long bao where the skin does not break before it gets to you.   Broken and juiceless XLB. Every time.     That being said, I've returned here on a few occasions.Its definitely not the place for perfect XLB reminiscent of Taiwan's Din Tai Fung or Markham's counterfeit Ding Tai Fung, but it'll do if you're in the area, or don't have a personal stake in the the pursuit of the perfect soup dumpling."}
{"text":"We came to this dumpling restaurant on the recommendation of an acquaintance. The are around Mother's Dumpling is a bustling china town and only a small walk to or from the Kensington market area. The restaurant itself is simple and clean. They hand you a four page menu with a paper and pen to tick off what your order is. They provide a very wonderful Jasmin tea that even my young kids loved. The restaurant was steady but not busy for a Thursday dinner time. Our wait was not terribly long. The food came out in pieces. First we received the General Tso, then the potato pancakes, then a few minutes later the steamed dumplings and so on. We ordered six different items and they all came this way. Thankfully we were doing family style but had we each gotten something individually the first person would have been done eating by the time the last person received their meal. The food was good but in comparison to other places I've eaten it was just just okay. The prices are reasonable for the food. The place doesn't take Credit cards but will take a debit card if you have no cash, which they will always gladly accept.  If your looking for dessert and want to stay with oriental cuisine try Mashion Bakery just a block down on Spadina for sweet or savory desserts. Cash or debit only as well."}
{"text":"Love love love this place, a bit of a wait because it's always packed but it is well worth it. The amount of food u get for the price is unheard of nowadays. Dumplings are definitely the main gimmick and are fantastic with a good variety of options"}
{"text":"Their boiled dumplings are cheap and yummy! Pork and chives is definitely my go-to. They are juicy and not too salty  I've also had some of their other steamed pork dumplings, which taste great as well but costs a little more. Their noodles are okay but were a little lacking in flavour. Side dishes like veggies tend to be a little more expensive, so I wouldn't particularly come here for that.   Atmosphere is surprisingly great. Can get really busy at times but the overall feel of the restaurant is both casual and intimate enough to make for a comfortable home-y dining experience. Great place for dinner with friends!"}
{"text":"Overall this is a safer choice however nothing will blow you away. Everything is good. The service is a bit slow. The prices are also average."}
{"text":"My wife and I made the trek to TO to eat dumpling from this place and Dumpling House.  Unfortunately, I felt this places dumplings fell short of expectations. The dumplings were certainly fresh and pretty tasty, but overall, I didn't try anything that stood apart from any of the other highly regarded dumpling houses in Chinatown.  The restaurant is certainly the biggest I tried in town.  the only standout during my meal was a smashed cucumber salad.  It was an incredibly simple dish, but very flavorful and delicious.  In fact, having figured out the the ingredients, my wife and I started making a version of it at home.  Cucumbers aside, despite the various reviews I found online, I will not be going back to this place."}
{"text":"+5 stars for delicious dumplings. Definitely order the juicy pork dumplings and chicken and mushroom dumplings.   -2 stars for over charging customers paying in U.S. dollars. When I received the bill, I said I'm paying in U.S. dollars and they said the bill will be reduced by 10%. Considering the current U.S.-Canada exchange rate, the reduction should actually be 25%. Also, we ordered the sesame balls and they came out undercooked."}
{"text":"Do you like freshly cooked dumplings? This is your jam then. You can even see them making the dumplings in the kitchen so you know they are fresh. Gets pretty busy, so be prepared to wait but there is a decent amount of seating so it's not too bad. They take debit or cash.  We loved the boiled pork and chive dumplings, followed by the pan fried pork dumplings. The Gai Lan was good and a huge serving. The steamed shrimp, egg and chive dumplings were kinda gross to us - really fishy tasting. I also have had way better fried onion pancakes elsewhere.  Great place to go with a few friends to share a bunch of things."}
{"text":"Mother's Dumplings has been around a loooong time and I'm not surprised. While it doesn't serve the best of the best, it is a very solid go-to place for many people and I've yet to hear a single bad story once.  This place is somewhat famous as I had known about it for at least a decade before I finally found my way there. I thought it was a great Dumpling restaurant. The dumplings here are not amazingly better than your standard good Dim Sum place but again, you won't go wrong here at all.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Watching the staff here handmake the dumplings right in the middle of the restaurant got me pretty exciting about Mother's Dumplings. However, both times I went here my table was forgotten about and we either got our food after waiting over an hour and asking about our order multiple times, or we just paid for the one item that came to us and left before we got to eat the rest of our order because they had clearly forgotten about us and our order (forcing us to go eat somewhere else, because needless to say, we were still hungry).   So disappointing. I guess this handmade dim sum is just not in the cards for me."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place when walking up Spadina.  The first things I noticed were the giant windows and the... \"funky\" lounge decor.  It seemed pretty crowded, and didn't look run down like a lot of other places on Spadina (excluding Lee's Garden, which is a phenomenal Chinese restaurant that's been around for quite a while in Toronto).  The place is good!  And it's a novel approach to serving some Chinese food-- the idea of just serving dumplings makes it super fun to order.  And, as to be expected from a place specializing in dumplings, it's all made on the spot.  The dough they use is good and chewy, just the way it should be.  Now, the steamed pork soup dumplings (siu long bao) are not the best I've had (I like them soupier, with a thinner dough), but then again, you get those in Shanghai, and I won't hold that against Mother."}
{"text":"I ordered the pan fried dumplings and it took just over an hour to arrive. The restaurant wasn't busy either, there was no lineup."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the overhype from friends but it was really really mediocre. I would suggest dumpling king or dumpling house if you want dumplings. I felt the dumpling skin was too soft and the noodles were very boring. The prices were also high comparatively. To paint a picture it was all caucasians there.  (Nothing wrong but we were the only Asians and that says a lot for a restaurant in Chinatown) No special dishes here either to make a trek out for. It IS a very spacious restaurant and accommodating compared to most restaurants in Chinatown. Also decent service (better than most Asian restaurants). Maybe that's why it's so popular among caucasians. :)"}
{"text":"If I ever come back to Toronto, I would eat here again. Delicious authentic Chinese dumplings and noodles!  Take everyone's recommendations and order the pork, shrimp and melon fried dumplings. They're steamed then fried on one side to get the perfect slight crisp. Delectable!  The wonton soup was delicious as well. I love the addition of seaweed to the soup.  We definitely ordered too much for two people, but it we just had to try everything! The ta lu noodles with hand pulled noodles was good, as was the dessert buns and of course the green onion pancake.  Not the absolute cleanest as I witnessed the dumpling-making ladies snack on sliced cucumbers with their fingers and go right back to making dumplings... but I guess that's a hazard of sitting at the table with the best view of the dumpling making table?  I trust that the food has been made to order and cooked to the appropriate temperature and will eat here again."}
{"text":"I understand the appeal of freshly made dumplings.  I also understand how ridiculously simple they are to make, coming from a Chinese family. I remember lazy Sunday afternoons when the entire family gathered around the kitchen table, even my then-five-year-old sister, with little pieces of wrapping and an enormous bowl of tossed-together filling. And then we'd wait eagerly for batch after batch of fried and boiled dumplings to come out of the pots and pans and land into our mouths.   That being said, the fare found at Mother's Dumplings is decent. Though nowhere near as good as our family recipe (and trust me, it was nothing special) and much, much pricier.   Some foodstuffs, like sushi and macarons, are hard to get right. Dumplings are not (or so I think). Therefore I find this place overpriced and only slightly above mediocre."}
{"text":"came here for take out, took about 15 minutes for my order to be done (i only ordered 3 items). i believe because this was chinese cuisine, i ordered the seaweed salad thinking it was going to be like the ones you get at japanese restaurants, but it was legit seaweed (didnt really enjoy it, very garlic-y). i got the steamed dumplings filled with (pork or beef i dont remember) and bok choy and the bbq pork steamed buns. i either hyped myself up too much for this place or i didnt order the right items. overall it was okay but maybe ill come back. try something else and update my rating"}
{"text":"Don't see what all the fuss is about.  We had steamed dumplings, boiled dumplings, and a beef pancake.  Not terrible but not outstanding.  The dumplings didn't have a ton of flavour, and they were definitely overpriced for the quality.  With so many better options in Chinatown, I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  My friends and I came here for lunch expecting amazing xiao long bao! (soup dumplings) I had heard a lot about it. When we got there, it was a little disappointing.  The environment was pretty a casual Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. They only take debit and cash. If you're from the US, your debit card won't work in Canada. One cool thing about the restaurant is that you can see the older ladies making dumplings in the open kitchen part of the restaurant. I think this is pretty standard for dumpling places--they want to show that they're handmade.   We tried ordering some fresh greens but they were out of the one we wanted. We got green beans instead, but the flavoring was a little off. Was that butter I tasted?  Now, for the dumplings. We ordered vegetable dumplings and pork soup dumplings. The vegetable dumplings were a little bit understeamed, and it seemed that they had been sitting out for a while. The folds were a little hard to chew and weren't very soft, and then the bottom of the dumpling was a little mushy. The soup dumplings had an average flavor and were folded with too many folds on top. There wasn't that much soup in each dumpling either, which was very sad to me. Overall, they didn't strike me as very authentically flavored either.  Very disappointing, wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt, but it just didn't end up working out. Sorry Mother's Dumplings.  I will note though that my friends went at night to eat here and they had an AMAZING time. Maybe lunchtime just isn't the time to go."}
{"text":"The dumplings are good even tho the wait and service can be a bit frustrating. There's a few other dumpling places around this neighbourhood but this place is my go to, they have chicken and veg options...."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was expecting much better food, but it turned out to be just okay.  The ones in the metro Atlanta area are even better than this place.  The server was very nice but the service time was very slow on off-peak hours.  I waited more than 30 minutes from the time I sat down to when I got my food.    I order the wanton and the juicy pork bun.  The wanton soup flavor is average.  I am not sure the soup is a pork/chicken based soup or it has any of the meat in the base.  The filling in the wanton is not my favor.  I feel that I can make better wanton than this place.  The juicy pork bun is a little bit below average from the taste to texture.   Overall, this place is average.  I will not considered eating here next time when I am in Toronto because I am sure there are other better places than this one to dine in."}
{"text":"It's alright food, normal onion pancake, bad stir fry noodle, nothing special about the dumpling(it's frozen dumpling, not freshly made) I think people overrated about this place, I wouldn't come again"}
{"text":"Came during lunch on a Thursday, and it gets busy.  They have a lot of seating upfront and all the way to the back, but quite a line still formed at the door.  Ordering is done on an order sheet. As each dish arrives, they are marked off. This makes things easier for customers, since if you're missing a dish there's paper-trail.  I'm not sure if it's due to how many customers there are, but food comes out pretty slow. Expect to wait 10-30 minutes depending on what you ordered. Food comes out as they are prepared so you won't be waiting until everything is ready before they start serving them up.  Food was alright I guess.  The shrimp dumplings come with a nice piece of shrimp. The lamb shu mai had that nice lamb flavor that I like. The xiao long bao's had some soup in it.  I think the main reason why it takes a long time to serve food is most of their dumplings are steamed, rather than boiled or pan-fried, and there probably isn't much you can do about it unless you could guess what people would order and try to get some steamers going beforehand.  Compared to other dumpling places in chinatown, it's a little higher on the price point as well, where you're paying as much, or more, for less quantity. In this scenario, the taste would have to make up for it, but for me it wasn't that much better.  If you're looking for a dumpling place that's comfortable to dine, where you're not crowded into tables surrounded by a bunch of other people, this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"I love the new space.  It's fun and festive and comfortable enough to stay for a very long time.  Dumplings are very good.  People are wonderful.  It's fun to watch the dumplings being made.  I love it here.  It's great.  I can't imagine going very often given that it pretty much sells only dumplings, but whenever I feel up to the caloric challenge, I'll be in the back room."}
{"text":"Used to go there when this place was a hole in the ground. Literally, it was underground and the only way to get into it was through some nondescript stairs on the north side of Dundas and two blocks west of Spadina. The place looked mildly lime-green depressing and a little worse for wear. However the dumplings were decent and very, very cheap.   After a while, once they got popular they moved to their current location just south of College and Spadina. A vast improvement if you ask me. They even have a sunroof, a water fountain and a few fake plants as they are apparently are going for a mini-garden look at the back. Definitely more inviting and they still have their open kitchen in case you are curious to see how your dumplings a made.   The dumplings are still okay, definitely a place to go if you are in the neighbourhood and the prices although raised are still a good deal. Expect 3 people to eat quite a bit for under $30.   Definitely a great starter place to bring the uninitiated or as it was the case during my last visit, if you are with a first timer vegetarian, are in the hood and starving. Good veggie options can be found here like the pancakes and buns. Personally, I like me my pork, shrimp and chives, steamed, not fried.   Quality wise? I must admit I feel as if they have somewhat slipped in the last couple of years... OR my dumplings palate has graduated a notch or two and I find other locales, specially outside the downtown core to be better.   So take note, to the more discerned taste buds, you will have to go elsewhere, plus you will have to open up your wallet a little wider."}
{"text":"Bumbaaaa! I rolled the dice and got 13 dumplings for the price of 12, score. Came here because in all honesty, I didn't feel like spending an arm and leg for dinner again, and cheaped out on Chinese. Started off with the hot and sour, bowl came out cold, would not recommend even after getting waiter to heat up. Not hot or sour, just cold and bland. Unexpectedly, loved their shrimp fried rice, it was perfectly seasoned, not too oily, but just enough to keep you wanting more. Dumplings stole the light of the night. As expected by the name of the restaurant, dumplings made my \"momma\" and her crew were delicious. Though a little drier then I am used to, but paired with soya sauce and chili oil it tasted satisfying. Dumplings and Creemore Springs ftw!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was what we ordered, but I found that everything in this spot was pretty lacklustre.   First of all, it was super hot in there. Yes, it was a hot day, but it was even hotter inside.   The food was just OK. Hot and sour soup was bland and needed a dose of salt and vinegar. The pork soup dumplings were tasty, but very soggy. The tofu string salad was unexciting.   We ended up leaving to satisfy our dumpling craving elsewhere."}
{"text":"Visiting from NYC, we wanted to try the xiao long bao, and see if the quality is better than back home. Expectations were high, we had just had 4 quality Chinese meals in the Markham/ North York area...   We ordered the soup buns- basically no soup, and overpriced ($7.50/8pc for pork, not crab!), onion pancake - dry, thick, puck of a thing... Some noodles and veg.   Food: Very Unsatisfying.    We sat by the window where people are making dumplings, that was neat, but there was also no AC to speak of, just some fans. We were sitting around, sweating, eating mediocre food. All in all, a pretty bad experience. Can't recommend it!"}
{"text":"I look up yelp and saw the lineups so I decided to try this place out. I was tricked into coming here!!! Why oh why did I waste my money here. Service was good but food is horrible. I drive by this place alot and there's always a line up at dinner time but mostly \"laowai\"....also very out dated. I guess people go here because  they are just following the flock."}
{"text":"From out of town and first and only time I've come here.. The dumplings were great!  Nicely cook with a variety of options to choose from. Great for vegetarians and omnivores alike. Price is average and good amount! Regular service speed. Would definitely come back regularly if I lived around."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Every time I go, I order something new and it's always good.  Food comes out when its ready, and not in any particular order, so when you go, just order a bunch to share.  It's more fun that way anyway.  Also, be careful for hot temperatures!"}
{"text":"Yum. The best dumplings I have had in a long time. My wife and I  hit this place hungry after work on a Friday and got boiled beef and celery dumplings and also the fried pork and bok choy dumplings, with won ton soup to share.  The fact these are made fresh to order is evident on the first bite. Truly delicious. Slop them in some soy/chili/vinegar mixture and you'll be a fan as well.  I noted the very reasonable beer prices despite being on a dry weekend. $4.50 for a Tankhouse is pretty good going. I get the reason why they do it but people who compare these dumplings to their mother's ain't exactly partial reviewers.  Get amongst it."}
{"text":"Mother's Dumplings is one of my favourite places to eat in the city. The dumpling are delicious and it's very affordable.   I've been going to Mother's for years now, since they were at the Huron location. When they first moved to the Spadina location, I have to admit they suffered some growing pains, and were painfully slow, service wise.  Coming up to a year at the new location, i feel like they've finally found their stride and now provide decent service.   I highly recommend ordering the Pork and Dill dumpling while you are here, as well as the green onion pancakes, both dishes are delicious. But don't be shocked if the dumpling you want are sold out. The establishment is wildly popular, but totally worth the hype."}
{"text":"I am a long term patron of Mother's Dumplings (affectionately shortened to \"Mo' Dumps\"), having gratefully devoured their dumplings since their days in a Huron Street basement.  Mo' Dumps is the basis on which all my other dumpling experiences are compared.  Over the last two years they have rode a surge of popularity amongst the university crowd and moved up to their current location at 421 Spadina.  Despite my long term patronage, I get merely a slightly wider smile and, perhaps out of shy recognition, the same table almost every time.  Mo' Dumps' recent fame has led to medium wait times to be seated, but it's rarely more than fifteen minutes.  The decor at the new location is a huge improvement over the dingy, crammed style of their previous spot.  The tables are generously spread apart offering conversational privacy and lots of room for the feast that will be imminently enjoyed.  The decorations are pleasant, if unmemorable - bouquets with notes wishing success were charmingly spread across their front counter, and they've kept the TVs showing idyllic flowery photos.  The space itself is long and narrow and lined with tables on the south side and the open, bustling kitchen on the north.  Service is somewhat lacklustre - they regularly forget parts of my order (arrives late), and are not quick to respond to requests.  Their business lunch service needs to be a little bit faster, as it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to over an hour to eat during lunch.  It currently seems hit-and-miss, but I'm sure it's just a hiccough in their expanded operations.  On my most recent visit, I went for the triumvirate of dumpling win: chicken and mushroom, lamb siu mai, and beef and chive.  Their boiled dumplings have always been their best, and as expected, the chicken mushroom was delicious: juicy, crammed with chicken, and wrapped in soft, starchy dough.  Their steamed dumplings tend to be a little dry, but the overpowering flavour of chive with the beef makes up for any shortcomings.  The lamb siu mai is their best dish: soft, delicious lamb perfectly seasoned and steamed.  While I opted not to order the pan fried pork dumplings, they are always a safe bet - hot, crunchy and oozing flavour.  With prices ranging $6.99 - $8.99 for a plate of 12 dumplings, it is reasonably priced for the quality of food you get.  However, at that price, I feel the service could be improved.  With a couple of slight adjustments, the restaurant would go from simply delicious, to all around amazing."}
{"text":"25 minute wait fir 10 dumplings (B10). Soggy, literally falling soft as I picked each one up. Must be a bad night (Tuesday @5pm...) will give another try... but SUPER reluctant."}
{"text":"Many people recommended this place and I should admit I loved it. Steamed and pan fried dumplings are amazing and fresh.  The wontons were amazing too. There are so many Chinese restaurants around in china town, but this place definitely stands out, they are fast, place is clean, food price is reasonable and the quality is amazing, it tastes perfect."}
{"text":"Disappointment.  There's no other way to describe my first and subsequent bites of what Mother's Dupmlings served us.  Now you're going to have to read this review with a grain of salt, because my dumpling standards are pretty high.  You don't eff with something I used to make with my grandmother.  Let's start with the basics.  The wah-teep (pot stickers for the white ppl) were soggy and sad.  They NEED to be crispy and nicely charred on one side and succulent on the other!  Right away I knew I was in for a rough ride.  Stopped eating them right away so I could take them home to re-fry.  The green onion pancake was ALL greasy dough, zero flake and required a flashlight to spot the onions.  Lamb sew-mi was gamey as all hell and I usually don't mind gameiness but this was almost inedible.  Had to soak it in soy and vinegar to get through most of them.   The broth for the wonton soup was actually pretty good with the combination of onions, mushrooms and random bits of veg, but the wontons themselves lacked any real flavour and personality.  Lastly the Xiao-Long-Bao's (soup dumplings).  They were okay, the dough was a little too thick, almost too chewy, the meat was... ah whatever, I wasn't happy with my meal here.  I held off coming here for a while because I didn't want to be disappointed; alas my fears came true in spades.  Where should I go now for dumplings?  Chinatown must redeem itself."}
{"text":"Definitely worst place ever!!!  As a Chinese, it is fair to say that their dumplings and other Chinese traditional food are not the best. It can not even be one of the good ones. However, every, EVERY server acts like that they are the BEST Chinese dumpling restaurant in the entire downtown area. They are arrogant, impatient, and completely not caring about your experience as a customer. They always think that they have the priority of doing things. Their attitudes tell you that you can go away and leave as you want. They do NOT care about anything about you. They are the GOD, and you are nothing.   Ok, let me tell you about my experiences. I ordered take outs several times. Every single time, I do not get any sauce including vinegar, soy sauce, and hot sauce. I had to ask them and then it took 5 minutes for them to pass only three sauces (do they need to produce the sauce from scratch or what). There were couple times that I did not even get chopsticks or forks or anything. Also, when they take your order, they do not even even look at it and just leave it on the table. And they may leave it there for 2 or 3 minutes until they remembered there is a takeout. Their attitude is completely 0 out of 10 (go there and try once if you don't believe) and the taste of their food is not even close comparing the good Chinese restaurant I went to. If it is possible, I would like to rate 0/5.   Let me explain why I ordered so many times and wrote this review until now. Everyone has bad days and good days, so it is understandable if they had a \"bad\" day or whatever. Unfortunately, I have to believe that it is their ignorance and arrogance after ordering so many times. My last and most important advice: There are so many good Chinese restaurants downtown. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE, OR U WILL REGRET."}
{"text":"The food here is certainly decent, however there were a few things that conspired to make my experience less than top-notch.  The tea was served lukewarm, which translated into lots of tea leaves floating in my beverage.  It's normal to see tea leaves but generally they float the bottom of your cup, almost immediately. If the tea isn't hot they just end up floating on the surface.  This isn't really a big deal, as the tea is generally an afterthought.  Service was slow and inattentive.  My shake came out late, we never received our waters, and the rice came out after all the food was eaten.  I'm no Asian, but I have to assume that rice generally tastes better when applied to other food.    \"It's not bad when you add soy sauce.\" I said.  Wife:  \"Dude, that is such a WHITE thing to do.\"  \"How can you eat this stuff by itself? So boring!\"  I'm not sure if they were short staffed or what, but I'll definitely give them another try soon.  Note: Regarding my strawberry-banana smoothie, it could have been a lot sweeter.  Situations like this must be why my Grandparents carried Sweet n' Low everywhere they went.  Rassum frassum."}
{"text":"I ordered the pot stickers here, and they were tasteless. I make my own dumplings at home, and even mine were better than the dumplings I had here. If you're looking for authentic Chinese dumplings that tastes good, this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"Are these the very best dumplings I have ever had? No. Were they just OK? Yes. The ordinary pork and chive dumplings ---around $6 for 6--came hot and fresh, but the flavor of the pork seemed a little strong. The flavor came through but they just didn't pop. The boiled ones were $5 for 6 and then if you want them pan fried, they're almost $10. How is that possible? Arent the dumplings already made? Just takes a hot pain to brown them up.  The biggest minus of Mother's Dumplings was the hot and sour soup. Thin, runny, vinegary and lacking the power of the more thick broth and assorted vegetables, or maybe some assertive tofu or pork slices, this was a very underwhelming mess. You shouldn't have to add significant amounts of sriracha and soy sauce to give this soup life This is a basic dish! Why can't they master this?"}
{"text":"Ate at Mother's Dumplings one rainy day last week and it was the perfect place to dry off, warm up and enjoy some casual food.   First impression: smells great in there! Even though their 'specialty' is porc and dill dumplings I wasn't a huge fan. They were good, but too dill flavored and just reminded me of a dill pickle. I really really liked the porc and bok choy dumplings though!"}
{"text":"Great place to get your hand made dumpling fix.  This place has good seating and is very casual.  The prices are great and the dumplings were quite tasty, not out of this world but def a place I'd come back to.  Make sure you use the black vinegar on the table.  Steamed or pan fried, both were great.   Though I was a bit disappointed with the juicy pork dumplings order of 8 but I finished the entire order!"}
{"text":"For a mom and pop shop in Chinatown - this ain't half bad!  I love the fact that the dumplings are all freshly made.   With a combination of my love for dumplings and Yelp reviewers - great dumplings - and don't even rate service, although not half bad - it's very asian eatery-styles!  PORK AND CHIVES (boiled) DUMPLINGS (12 or 24) - this was yummy, although smaller than the average dumpling I usually eat, it was still very filling.  The filling was fresh and flavorful, the skin was a little thick, but not too thick.    WONTON SOUP - this was interesting, it was yummy but unlike any other wonton soup i've had.  It had wontons, seaweed, dried shrimp and onion bits.  It had a lot of stuff in it, the large was enough for 4 people.  SMALL EATS:  We got the SEAWEED MARINADE and the TEA EGGS.  People who frequent chinese eatery's, these are common side dishes and it was great!  Overall, the experience was great.  Everything seemed fresh and well-made.  The service was fast and typical for your mom-and-pop shop.   I'd say: GO GIVE IT A WHIRL - it's just dumplings!"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall that serves dumplings and other northern chinese snack fare. I'm a fan of the pork bak choi ones-pan fried of course with a lashing of black vinager and chili flakes on the side. The zha jian mian is also nice on a hot day-wheat noodles with a chinese pork 'bolognese type' sauce topped off with cool cucumber and cilantro. Corn flour dumplings are unique -they are delicious if you want to try something quite different for dumplings. This place is not too look at it and service can can be curt at times but still not bad to fill you belly for under $10."}
{"text":"do not order anything else on the menu but dumplings!!  their dumplings are amazing, especially the steamed pork and chive.  we ordered the tofu \"salad\" and a lot of the tofu shreds were just stuck together.   the first time we came here, the kimchi friend rice was A+. the second time, it was really bad. The rice were stuck together in clumps, it was cold and tasteless. It was also white, not red which is strange since it is supposed to have kimchi. this place is really good for dumplings but i wouldnt recommend you get any of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Why did anyone not tell me this place had xiao long pao (soup dumplings).  I had loaded up on every other type of dumpling and ran out of space before I realized they had XLP.  They make everything by hand.  Fried, steamed, there is no bad way to go.  The only thing less than perfect was the char siew bun (bbq pork) bun - I did not care for the breading.  Otherwise, this place rocked!"}
{"text":"????????????????? ???????20????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????? ???????????????? ???????????????? ?????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about how Mother's Dumplings is THE best place to grab dumplings in China Town. Were they good? Sure. Were they the best? Probably not. The service was quick, and the selection was quite large. Would definitely go again to grab a quick bite, but definitely not the best dumpling place I've been to. Nothing over-the-top amazing."}
{"text":"I went Mother's Dumpling for New Year lunch. And I came back to the same restaurant next day! Because I loved their food.   Personally, dumplings (esp. steamed) were the most tastey ones, followed by pan cakes (Chives and eggs filled pancakes!). Steamed Buns were fine, I like them, just they weren't the best. Don't try sesami balls! I wanted to have hot-hot one, and my expectation turned into dissapointment :-/.  It's a busy restaurant. It may be because of that, they didn't track our order properly. They forgot to serve a rice, a noodle and so on. So far, they haven't overcharged, but I have to be careful around what I order and what I have on my table. That is why I dropped one star."}
{"text":"Hmm. Dumplings that were thick on the skin and light on the filling, made for suspicion of cost-cutting impressions. And with a half-hour wait, we must sadly conclude that we'll not contemplate revisitation...! 2 plates of dumplings came up to $20 with tip."}
{"text":"Great dumpling place on Spadina. Service isn't quick but when you are with a group catching up there's no worries there. Lots of vegetarian and regular options. The tea was refilled quite a bit and that's enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"YUM. I had Mother's Dumplings for the first time last month while visiting Toronto and will return every single time I'm in the city.   I showed up right when they opened, and within 10 minutes it seemed like every seat in the house was filled.   The inside of the restaurant is clean and relaxing, and you can even watch them make the dumplings which I thought was awesome. Everyone that works there is so nice, warm, and welcoming which I think adds that extra touch to an establishment.  My mom and I ordered quite a bit of food because everything sounded so good, and we weren't disappointed. The green onion pancake was delicious, and we had one each of fried, steamed, and boiled dumplings which were SO GOOD. The fat kid in me loved the fried dumplings the best. Such incredible, full flavor. The smashed cucumber salad was refreshing and delightful with it's light flavor, and the tofu noodles were a new experience for me, and I loved them as well.   I left Mother's Dumplings stuffed and happy beyond belief. Can't wait for my next Toronto visit :)"}
{"text":"Very rude. Terrible service. Not worth it. I cannot even believe how awful they were!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place and looking forward to having some dumplings!! this place was just OK! the dumplings were good, but the noodles were not that great and nothing special! with all the food places in toronto, i would venture somewhere else in the future!"}
{"text":"I love dumplings and I have not as of yet been to Mother's Dumplings.  My concern, like all diners, is to get good food at a reasonable price.  I find the reviews here to be rather uneven, and the owner is more interested in patronizing customers and asking about where they are from or saying come again.  The question is why?  There are a 100 Chinese restaurants on Spadina.  As far as I am concerned, you get one kick at the can.  Thats the whole thing about going out for food at any restaurant.  When food is good, I personally will come from long distances away for good food and I am LOYAL.  I have my fav restaurant just south of Mother's Dumpling and so people don't feel I am a shill for the restaurant I love, it will remain unnamed, but I go once a week to that restaurant with at least one other person and my bill is usually around $30 - $40.  Multiply that by 52 times a year and thats the revenue for these people.  When I start seeing more consistent reviews on this site, then I will take my hard earned money and give it a try.  Until then, I will take a pass."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here, the dumplings are delicious! Something happened to the service in the past year, however, and it has changed my whole experience. It has happened three times: I call in an order for pick up, am given a 20-30 minute wait time until my food is ready, then wait between 30 minutes TO ONE HOUR AND 15 MINUTES at the restaurant for my food. Also, they sometimes replace the soy sauce (which I assume is usually kikkoman by the taste) with packs of wing's soy sauce which is a major bummer."}
{"text":"One of the best dumplings is head in the city. They also have good priced alcoholic drinks like under $5 beers."}
{"text":"We read so much about Mother's Dumpling and was looking forward to it. Well....We were very disappointed with the choices available in the soups' section.  The pancake was a bit tough and it was way too thick. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.  There are other places in Chinatown that are much better and the service was not good.  If you are in the mood for soups, go to Saigon Palace across the street.  The soups are great and satisfying. They are under renovationg now, so keep your eye out for the grand reopening."}
{"text":"This place would be 5 stars if it EVER had pork and dill or any of their best dumplings. The last 5 times (not kidding) they've been out of pork and dill. How is that even possible? Take it off the menu because there's no way it's just selling out every time..."}
{"text":"It was dumplings heaven. Service was realistically quick. We got BBQ pork bun, onion pancake, pork dumplings, shrimp fried rice, shrimp boiled dumplings, sui mai it was just to die for.   Be ready to wait a little while or a lot depending on the time and day. But it's all worth it, the chili paste on the table makes everything taste even better.   Awesome dimsum place."}
{"text":"A few of my Canadian friends are really into this place. But as a Chinese, I don't feel too much about this restaurant. Considering the price/quality of the food there, there's definitely some other places more worth of going."}
{"text":"A trendy, sit-down restaurant that specializes in freshly handmade dumplings and noodles. Service is gracious but spotty, aided by a cheeky, Beijing vibe about the place that sets it apart from the other establishments in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Delicious. The dumplings were yummy, obviously. However, what we gobbled up even more quickly was the stir fried vegetables. Tasty and good for you. It's a bit more expensive than I expected, after all, we were in Chinatown. But alas, it was what it was."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot of good things about this place including a Blog To feature we thought we would try this. Sorry to say that we were yet again disappointed. I regret not taking a picture of our order but here it goes...  We ordered the juicy pork bun, fried pork and bok choy dumpling and a sweet and sour soup. The juicy pork buns aka soup dumplings did not impress. It was average at best. You can dip it in the vinegar at the table but that's about it. The pan fried dumplings were utterly disappointing and it looked like someone just threw them on the plate. They were a tad burnt and not cooked to perfection. They were also not seasoned so the vinegar (and the burnt parts) was very necessary with the meal. As for the soup - that didn't come out. There was no indication that they started the soup also so we had to cancel that order. After that, the bill came to almost $30 for two orders of dumplings. Left hungry and had to stop at McDonalds."}
{"text":"On a recommendation from a colleague we headed to Mothers Dumplings on a rainy Friday night, just managing to avoid the deluge as we reached the restaurant.  There were a few groups waiting, but fortunately as it was just me and Allerina M, we only waited for about 5 minutes before getting seated.  As with most authentic noodle and dumpling places, the process is on display and Mothers Dumpling is no different, with Mother (and Father it seemed on this day) working away making dumpling after dumpling behind a plexiglass screen.  The kids (waitstaff) were briskly moving around the restaurant bringing food to the guests. There was a little wait for the first dish, Pork and Chive Dumplings, to arrive but well worth it and not unexpected considering that the restaurant was full and it being a Friday night. Shortly after the Noodles & pan-fried bean sauce arrived. The fresh noodles were tender and tasty, taking on a coating of the pork in bean sauce after mixing. The last dish of pan fried pork and bak choi followed.  The dumplings were good, but could have done with slightly more soup. The pan fried pork and bak choi could have had a little more depth of flavour in the meat but were still tasty. Overall though, the three dishes were filling and warming on a rainy Friday night and reasonably priced.  The menu itself is not overly extensive, but I am looking forward to getting back to try out the other dumplings on offer."}
{"text":"The dumplings were really good, not a fan of the boiled ones but still OK. The server was sweet although it took a really long time to get her attention. Overall, it was ok. Huge place."}
{"text":"The was a bit of a wait to get a table.  Maybe 10-12 minutes.  So I had high expectations that this place would be good.  We ordered the hot and sour soup (medium) and the pork and dill dumplings.  The soup is pretty bland. A bit too much pepper.  Not enough spice. The small was pretty small.  Also not sour enough.   In addition, the dumplings were ok but nothing to write home about.  Service was ok. The place was cute.  Not sure if I would come back.  But my boyfriend did really like this place.  He would had rated it higher than me."}
{"text":"This location is lacking something from the original location that I can't put my finger on.  The menu seems smaller than what is offered in the original location as well but all the classics were there.  There wasn't much of a crowd when we visited during the weekday so when our orders came through, it was fast and furious.  For a group of 4, we ordered a combination of boiled dumplings (pork & dill), steamed dumplings (pork & chives, lamb shui mai, xiao long bao), panfried dumplings (pork & bak choi), and a beef and onion pancake.  The only disappointment of the bunch was the xiao long bao.  There was literally no soup within the dumpling skin and I have yet to come across a resto in Toronto that does this well.  All the other dishes were satisfactory in taste and presentation.    All-in-all, I am glad they have decided to add another location and within the very diverse Greektown neighbourhood as well."}
{"text":"Walked in on a rainy Sunday evening around 7. Got a table for two just fine (actually seated at a table for four) ... plenty of room.   We ordered pan-fried pork and celery dumplings and soup dumplings (\"juicy pork dumplings\"). They took a LONG time to come -- because of the steamed dumplings?  The pork/celery dumplings were actually very tasty, and ended up being our favourite.  The table next to us, a father and son combo, asked me for a recommendation and I pointed them that way. The dad sounded a little uncertain (\"celery?\") but I hoped they liked it.  The xiaolongbao had no flavour and were not very hot -- far from the worst I've ever had (which were SUPER greasy and were not cheap), but not worth writing home about. I like being able to eat them right away, but xiaolongbao should be searingly hot. We'll probably try something else next time.   Although we were fed and in all honesty, not hungry, we likely could have polished off a green onion pancake on the side. But I'm kind of a glutton.  The service was very nice. We were seated quickly. Our server was incredibly polite and a bit formal (in a good way) -- kind of belied the place's casual vibe.   Solid neighbourhood place (we're fairly close) and maybe a place for a hearty, affordable meal with friends, though I don't think it's a destination."}
{"text":"We had steamed beef/ celery dumplings and juicy pork. I think it's better choice than boiled.   We also ordered egg and dill pan fried pancakes- were not a fun of this. Too greasy and weird grassy tasty, didn't even finish.  Basically carefully research the fillings you chose.  The place is clean and well located in the heart of China Town with ample of street parking.  Would come again."}
{"text":"Mama's Dumpling, I love you. I wish my mama made food like this (or then again not because I'd weigh a solid ton). I've eaten here for a week in a row and not gotten tired of it. Really.  As the title suggests, DUMPLINGS are the key dish.  Here are the highlights, the must haves amongst the dumplings (and not in any particular order): Juicy pork buns.  The vegetarian dumplings with mushroom/bok choi/tofu. Beef and chives pork and chives Chicken and mushroom Pork and bak choi - steamed or crispy   Dumplings are the ultimate comfort food!  The beef pancake was also fantastic (but hey, I haven't sampled much of Chinatown)  If you dine in, you get pots of tea with your order so I love coming in here and taking a long break. FYI, they take debit only.  I really don't recommend anything seafood related here. I got a shrimp/egg/pork dumpling which was just terrible. I mean, it tasted like old, dirty cardboard (or how I imagine old dirty cardboard would taste...) It was just the combination...it just didn't work. Also avoid the pork and dill. I had a friend who had the noodle soup and gave it a \"meh\" review."}
{"text":"We visited a couple of years ago and it was hands down the best dumplings we had ever eaten. This trip was disappointing. The dumplings were nothing special. Not much flavour and the steamed dumplings fell apart. My husband also ordered a mango smoothy and it was bland and a very small portion for the price."}
{"text":"This place used to be my fav, but off late the service has declined and the quality of food is not the same. They opened up another branch at danforth and perhaps that could be one of the reasons ?"}
{"text":"thought I'd give it a try. kind of the same as dumpling house down the street. the clear noodle salad thing was not too exciting tho."}
{"text":"Honestly, this was such a bad experience. The only thing that redeemed  it from 1* to 2* was the fact that we received a pot of complimentary green tea once seated, and that one of our plates was canceled after complaining.  The reason I visited this restaurant out of all the restos in Chinatown is because I read in a travel guide that this place has great dumplings. I love dumplings. I eat them all the time in Montreal and they NEVER disappoint (Qing Hua dumplings, Sammi Soup Dumplings, etc.)   This place served me lukewarm dumplings, and their selection of fillings was sooooo limited. If they're not steaming hot or sizzling hot (depending on whether you order steamed or fried dumplings), I'm not interested because it means they've been sitting there for a while before being brought to my table. No excuse.  To make matters worse, we found all of the food overpriced and the \"vegetarian noodles with shrimp\" was inedible and gross. What a slimy mess!  One word: avoid."}
{"text":"The dumplings here rock! I ate myself stupid and then ate more. My friend had to roll me out of this place, listen to my whining as we unsuccessfully tried to walk the food off for about 45 minutes and feed me shots in an attempt to break down the food and speed up digestion so my belly could stop stretching.   Would I do it again? Absolutely!   We had the boiled chicken and mushroom dumplings, the steamed beef and chives dumplings, the green onion pancakes and the steamed shrimp, egg and chives dumplings. All were more delicious than the next.   The place is very affordable on top of it all, our tab was $33 for two of us (plus tip). The next time I'm on business travel in Toronto, I'm coming back here for another food coma!"}
{"text":"The best dumplings in Toronto. They also have very good pancakes & noodles. Their menu is helpful for vegetarians since they offer veggie choices for many of their menu options."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dumplings in the city. You can never go wrong with having dumplings here. I've been here several times and always look forward to ordering here. This time I ordered the boiled Shrimp, pork, egg & chives dumplings, fried Pork and bak choi and fried Pork, shrimp and melon. In addition we ordered some side dishes such as the Green Onion Pancake and Potato salad. The order came up relatively quickly in about 20 minutes. It was delicious as always and they are nicely made. You will not be disappointed. The dumplings on the menu are also readily cheap so it makes for a nice filling cheap meal. Overall, great food and friendly staff. Will definitely recommend to others and will always be a long time customer!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for dumplings in downtown Toronto. Immediately when you walk into the restaurant, you will see the staff making the dumplings in an area separated by glass panels on the left. It feels like \"home\" to me, for someone who is Chinese. I have tried their pork & chives dumplings, pork & bok choi dumplings, steamed juicy pork buns, and wonton soup. I thought that their dumplings are fairly authentic. The steamed juicy pork buns are also good, but it can use some more soup inside, which is the key to this dish. Overall, I love this restaurant and I would definitely go there more often."}
{"text":"I decided to pay Mother's Dumplings a visit just to see what the hype was all about. My overall take on MD? Meh. It wasn't as amazing as everyone said it was.   You definitely get that welcoming ambiance from the restaurant - the red walls, the fairy lights and framed pictures definitely made patrons feel \"at home\" at MD.   Service was really slow. I had to wait for about 10 minutes to get seated and my waiter took ages to come back to check on me after I ordered my food. I will give the restaurant some slack here though - since all the dumplings and baos - from the skin to the filling was homemade, it makes sense that it took a while to get our food. I just wish that the servers themselves were a little more attentive to the patrons - at the very least, they could have let us know how long the food is going to take to arrive at our tables. Overall, in terms of service, the staff were friendly albeit a bit inattentive.   I ordered the soup dumplings, Northern style wonton soup and vegetarian buns. I was hoping that the food would live up to their prices...not exactly the case here. The food was average at best. I was underwhelmed by the quality of the soup dumplings. The pork filling could have been juicier. The skin could have been thinner. There was barely any soup in the soup dumplings. The Northern style wonton soup was slightly better in comparison to the soup dumplings. The broth wasn't as greasy as most broths that are served in Northern Chinese restaurants, which was a plus. I also enjoyed the gingery flavour of the broth. The vegetarian buns were good but they weren't anything special.   Overall, some of their food items were better than others. There are definitely better Northern Chinese restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian dumplings in town. The A5 is amazing and my go-to order. Also like their green onion pancake!"}
{"text":"I am here for my very first time and just had the BEST dinner!  Sunny my waitress was kind, informative and professional. She figured out I was not interested in her being my best friend but that I wanted a great culinary experience and privacy. Both happened tonight. Bravo to this restaurant and chefs. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The worst service possible ..everybody around us was just asking for their food and left without getting half of their stuff. Portion sizes have gone smaller than before and the owners don't care if you complain. Would never come back here again. I usually don't write reviews like this but this was absolutely the worst experience i've ever had in a restaurant!"}
{"text":"The dumplings may not look pretty but they sure taste good! It also tastes very home-made which is why I bumped the star up to 4. The restaurant didn't have a lot of Chinese customers (which had me concerned that it wouldn't taste authentic) but after a little bit of a wait, everything came at one go and we were very satisfied. Come early because popular dumplings will be gone!"}
{"text":"One of the things we had was rice, it was kind of mushy but there were also small pieces that were clumped together and hard, although the dumplings were great and there were many different kinds of them, soup dumplings and pork. The staff were a bit slow and when we decided what we were going to have. We had to wait about 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of dumplings but I can tell this was better than average. Pretty big selection for a decent price."}
{"text":"Our favorite downtown dumpling spot, though the quality can vary. But steamed dumplings always fine, green beans great. This locatiion better than the Danforth one."}
{"text":"Eh. It's fine if you stick to the dumplings. Steam buns, rice dishes etc. are underwhelming and you can expect a 15-30 minute wait on most orders. Requesting drink refills or the status of missed orders can take a long time."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after checking into my hotel (Super 8 Downtown... cheap, clean, in Chinatown, - short walk from Mother's).   Ordered a feast. Boiled Pork and Shrimp Dumplings, steamed pork and scallion dumplings and scallion pancake. Mmmm."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now so I think I can be fair on this one.  First time we got steamed and fried. Pork and melon and Pork and chive. It was a mistake, don't get the steamed it took almost 40 minutes to come to our table! The fried ones were good though but sometimes really oily. Also got the Dau-Lu noodles. It was good but needed alot of soy sauce and sriracha. I guess that doesn't count as good for most people... Most recently I tried the soup dumpling - it was really good, soft, flavourful, and delicious.   Solid place, price is okay.   Would I return? Yes but since I found Dumpling House i'm not sure I will come as often since their dumplings are comparable but the price is better over there."}
{"text":"3.5** stars.  Coming from a Chinese family where we make, boil/steam and pan fried dumplings, I wasn't expecting too much. I just wanted to find a place to fill my dumpling fix after going months without having home made ones.  I went in at 5:00pm. Though 3-4 tables were occupied, food did take some time to arrive, each dish coming 10 mins apart. I can't imagine how long it would take on a busy night. But apart from this, I do understand it is made fresh on the spot.   Ordered: Steamed pork & pickled cabbage dumpling - Texture and flavour was nice. I didn't need to add any sauce to accompany it. Though it was on the dry side.  Pan fried pork & bak choi dumpling - I enjoyed this one. The savoury broth was bursting out as I took each bite. Just the way I like it.  The $1.50 soup - I was curious as to what a $1.50 soup can get me. It was just broth, with dried shrimp and seaweed (As indicated on menu). A fair size. Probably more worth it to order it with won ton though.   Overall, service was attentive. Food was decent. A bit on the pricey side, as compared to the dumpling houses I've tried in Markham and Scarborough.    I would probably try other dumpling house places, before coming back here."}
{"text":"Ok I saw reviews stating these are the best in the city but honestly... I beg to differ.   The selection isn't that big for a place that specializes in dumplings and while I ordered soup dumplings they were rather dry inside and not soupy at all.   I actually prefer some of their completion to this joint also they were a bit pricey for what you get compared to other places. I find 9 dollars steep for dumplings!   Was a good experience to have once but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was glad to see a dumpling place open on the Danforth.  The Danforth can have a certain \"sameness\" to the restaurants so this was welcome.  My visit had its ups and downs.  The service was really good.  No problems there at all.  The meal started with the hot and sour soup which, as other people here have noted, wasn't good at all.  Really disappointing.  Watery, flavourless and not even hot temperature-wise.  Just luke warm.  Probably the worst hot and sour soup I've ever had.  Try Lin Gardens for the best hot and sour soup in the city.  The two soups don't compare.  Definitely not recommended.  The cold Korean style noodles was quite good.  Very tasty and refreshing.  I've never had anything like it.  Really good.  The chives and egg pancakes were okay, but nothing to write home about.  The beef and chives steamed dumplings were definitely the highlight.  Excellent flavours.  Well, this is a dumpling place so it's no surprise that dumplings are their speciality.  I'd absolutely recommend the dumplings, but other areas are definitely in need of improvement.  Nice atmosphere, though.  Not a great first impression, but I'm still rooting for Mother's Dumplings to do well."}
{"text":"Mother's Dumplings have moved to Spadina, which is both a bad and a good thing.   A bad thing because no longer can I impress friends from out of town, and even some Torontonians, by taking them up the little side street that is Huron Street, then down into a dingy little basement full of steam with an open kitchen at the back and have them feast on some of the best dumplings in town. Damn, damn, damn.   The new Mother's Dumplings is large, airy and downright mainstream. Tables are well spaced - bizarrely the large room is only licensed for 41 diners - which gives a feeling of openness that was completely absent in the old location.   Thankfully the food is just the same. Delicious dumplings, wonderful soup - I am addicted to the seaweed, sesame, dried onion stock that can be ordered on the side - and the same old friendly, warm service.   I really wish them well even though I loved the old hole in the wall location with all my heart."}
{"text":"No, no. no!   Or as my mother would say... hoa diulain! She would be ashamed if she made dumplings like the ones we had at MD.   Dumplings to the Chinese are like soul food - I grew up around dumpling parties where a squadron of mothers, aunties, and grandmothers sat around a huge table and wrapped each little parcel lovingly by hand. Sometimes the wrappers were made from scratch, but what was common was that each house had their own cherished and custom recipe for the filling.  The abominations we had at Mother's Dumplings, however, would never qualify as those delicious little bites of heaven that my mother and her compatriots would craft. The juice inside the xiao long boas we ordered were tepid and flavorless, and as for boiled dumplings... pork and dill? That recipe needs to be tossed out - the dill was overpowering and made me feel like I was eating a pickle instead of a dumpling.   My excitement from the memories this place's name evoked turned into inconsolable disappointment after we tasted the food - go somewhere, anywhere else in Chinatown for your dumpling fix. Or better yet, come to my mother's house and try her dumplings!"}
{"text":"The dumplings are ok, but the main dishes are not well done, actually poorly done. The sour and spicy soup turns out to be egg tomato soup, and the green vegetable dishes served in the last minute. If you go, order dumplings and probably some cold dishes"}
{"text":"Everything I ate here was scrumptious. And cheap too! The xiao long bao were filled with piping hot and gushing juice as you bit into them. The broth for the beef noodle soup was very well flavoured and light tasting. The green onion beef wraps came out warm, very tender meat, and served with a tangy hoisin sauce. You can't beat fresh handmade dumplings and xiao long bao or hand pulled noodles. Not to mention, you can watch the mothers (and fathers) making them while you eat. :)"}
{"text":"I've been exposed to a dumpling-load of praise for the original Mother's Dumplings location at Chinatown. So when a second location popped up on my side of the Don River, I took it upon myself to find out what the buzz's worth.  Maybe or maybe not that was a good idea because one gets exposed to potential opening week jitters (maybe that's what it really was).   There are some items you can feed yourself a couple for cheap (like their rather watery $1.50 congee), but the dumplings themselves weren't exactly steaming with packed flavour as I'd had hoped. Yes, they're made fresh to order--and they're quick about it. At between $6 and 9 for a plate of 10 dumplings, they're not as dirt cheap as a bowl of congee, but not very pricey either. I suppose you could get away with a filling meal under $10 if you play your cards right and am not entirely hungry.  The interior is respectably clean and orderly and simple, with a mix of tables and booth seating. You can expect the same kind of attentive service as you would with most other Chinese eateries.  {TTC: Mother's is smacked in the middle between Pape and Donlands station on the Danforth. If you find yourself on the 83 bus, just get off at Danforth and head west to Woodycrest.}"}
{"text":"Mother's Dumplings has changed my mind about Chinese food... my only experience before was terrible takeout and the Mandarin (ew, ew, the Mandarin) and I had decided I hated it. No longer!   The PORK AND PICKLED CABBAGE STEAMED DUMPLINGS were so good and perfectly soft and chewy--way better than the greasy pan fried or the slippery boiled.   We also had the NOODLES WITH BEEF IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE. Tasty does not begin to describe how--well--TASTY, this dish is!! Everyone at the table agreed that these noodles were some of the best Chinese food they had ever tasted, newbs and Kensington Chinese food veterans alike.   I'm a fan! But only time and more Chinese food expeditions will tell if this is really great Chinese food, or just a hella lot better than bad takeout."}
{"text":"I love dumplings... they're one of my favorite comfort foods.  So when you have a restaurant dedicated to dumplings, you better deliver.  Mother's Dumplings was kind of a disappointment.  Although they had a good variety of steamed/boiled/pan fried dumplings... they were all sub par.  Thick skin, very little meat, lacking flavor.  Worst of all, they weren't cheap.  I always finish my food but I left more than half the dumplings unfinished.  Enough said."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, as I've been on the hunt for some authentic sui long bao in Toronto since I've tried some amazing ones in Vancouver, but this place fell way short of my expectations.  The pastry was ok (it as thin enough but it was a bit chewier than expected) and the filling was off (it lacked the gingery taste and the  silky smooth texture).  I found the other wrappings of the other dumplings we ordered a bit on the doughy side.    However, their beef roll was very good.  But not good enough for me to go back just for that dish."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! The pork and bok choy fried dumplings were divine.... They were so good I went to talk to the manager to tell the chef how much I enjoyed them. They tasted freshly made and we're fried well. The smashed cucumber salad was also ridiculously delicious. This place is lightyears ahead of the Dumpling House also on Spadina.   The restaurant was clean and staff were efficient and really nice.   Damn Mother's Dumplings! I was seriously in heaven when eating there today. I'm craving more dumplings already. Will be back ASAP, you made me so happy with your delicious dumplings!"}
{"text":"I used to go their old location on Huron St back in day 1 since couple years back. Food were ok but we don't go to the Spadina location anymore as there was a horrible problem everyone need to be careful about: there are something like mechanical black grease always stick around the bowl, dishes or tea cup. It happened several years ago at my last 3 visit. I called up the manager to tell him about the problem and he told me not to look at the grease at the button of my bow but look inside. I gave up and walk away. 3 years later, I came by last week and thought maybe I was in bad luck last visit and decide to give them a try again. I ordered my dishes and ready to enjoy my tea. Here go again....... My tea cup I found 3 black dots inside the cup and my fingers felt like the same black mechanical grease again. The waiter no1. Apologized and gave me another new cup. Here go again, another cup with black grease dots again. This time waiter no2.came around the tried his fingers to get the grease out and promised he will get a clean cup to me. The new cup end up also from the same dishwasher tray had the same black grease that splashed all over the all the dish and cup. I called up the manager who was in eyeglasses and complaining about the situations which made me losing my appetite tonight. He denied there were anything wrong with the dishwasher but mentioned something that I might need to go check in with my eye doctor. Here I walked out from this place again and never want to come back again. Not because the food but this place had a very serious health problem the manager tried very hard to ignore the same old problem that had existed for so long. I really don't know how many customers they had in the past had these chemicals into their tommy. I don't think I am the only one who is aware of this horrible things happened everyday in this place. I will call up the city to see about the food safety problems they have for so many years. I always love to try dumpling from different restaurant around Chinatown but this place I will never come back again.PLEASE, EVERYONE CHECK OUT YOUR DISHES, BOWL AND TEA CUP BEFORE ORDER YOUR FOOD THERE,PLEASE DO CHECK THEM FOR YOUR SAFETY'S SACK!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a whitewashed place"}
{"text":"This quite a popular place, but if you arrive early enough getting a spot isnt too hard.  Attentive staff, quite good actually but as expected they run around very quickly so you may want to raise your hand if you need something.   Does take plastic,  but ONLY CANADIAN OR US DEBIT CARDS , NO CREDIT CARDS,  and cash always works.   Some interesting surprises, the mixed salad contains something the equivalent of a side of basically boiled peanuts. These are great to devour and nibble on,  if a bit tricky to eat with chopsticks.   But of course this place is for dumplings.  Long story short good..  not amazing.   Had about three kinds.  A so so pan fried shrimp and chive,  a bit small with OK and minimal flavor.  A steamed shrimp pork and chive, bit crumbly and tasteless.   However,  the boiled and pork and dill is a true winner.   Prices here are very reasonable.   Id go back an explore and try more if I could"}
{"text":"These are the best dumplings I have ever had...super delicious and fresh. Total comfort food, even for a second generation Chinese Canadian . I don't have much more to add from other reviews...I just wanted to say YELP: LET US UPDATE THE ADDRESS. it is now at 421 Spadina, just south of college on the east side."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not the biggest fan of boiled dumplings... I'm more of a wonton wrapper sand XLB kind of gal, but what the heck, these boiled dumpling with pork and bak Chou could change my life.  Unfortunately it didn't. For 5.99 you got 12 dumplings, which I think we ended up getting a more generous portion of 15. You could not really identify the bak Chou, although the pork tasted fresh. The dough did not taste much different from the one I buy from a package, although the more I ate, the better it tasted. I liked loading up on the vinegar, and as I bit into each dumpling, it reminded me a little of a XLB because there was a little bit of soup contained inside.  I love watching the cooks in the kitchen and seeing all the other dishes being ordered. I would definitely want to try some of the other buns.. Including pan fried red bean and dessert ones.  Each order is prepared upon ordering so be prepared to wait for those dumplings to cook. It gets pretty at night so if it's prime time, then you will probably have to wait for a table. You can also buy dozen packaged dumplings for your enjoyment at home. How good is that.  So I can't say that this was the best dumplings ever, but I'll be back.. Hopefully my two stars isn't too discouraging..."}
{"text":"Do you want to see waiters being treated like slaves? Come to Mothers Dumpling. Two poor girls running around insanely, serving, cleaning all the tables. You have to dance to get her attention and I do not blame her. The food is decent and hence the two stars."}
{"text":"Pretty good damn .  Everything we ordered was solid.  Dumplings were delicious.  Didn't expect this place to be as good as it was."}
{"text":"The dumplings are really good (except for the whole wheat ones which were not to my taste).  I'm not giving it a 5 because service is a bit slow, probably because it is very crowded!   I went there twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. It is quieter for dinner.  I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I want to have some Chinese dumplings and noodles recently, so my friend recommended it to me. We visited there around 12:30 pm, it was not very busy. The restaurant was very clean and nice, all the dumplings were handmade freshly inside everyday. We ordered steamed pork and sour cabbage dumplings made in whole wheat flour(six pieces for $5.75), Dan-dan noodles with pork soy-bean paste, and small size dish of pickled vegetables. Honestly, the food there was very authentic and delicious but the price was a little expensive. It served us with hot black tea which made me very comfortable. It should be suitable for groups people to share because larger portion order would be much cheaper."}
{"text":"Final Verdict: If you are looking for one of the best dumpling places in the town, Mother's Dumplings is just the right place for you. Having one of the juiciest and most flavourful dumplings I have ever tried in China town, Mother's Dumplings offers diverse food items that are not all dumplings at a reasonable price. Service is quick, but the servers don't always stay alert to the needs of their customers.   Full Review  Almost two and a half years ago, my friend convinced me to try out a restaurant that was a sketchy little shop located underground at the heart of Chinatown. Above the entrance, there was a red sign that read \"Mother's Dumplings\" in both English and Chinese. When we went in, my doubt for the quality of the restaurant became even bigger; indoor space was just dingy with dark lighting and grey walls that needed repainting, and it had a stale odour to it. Once we were seated in front of the kitchen area, I noticed that one side of the wall was almost fully covered with notes from previous customers, all of them commenting on something positive about the restaurant. It occurred to me then that I might be sitting in one of the best restaurants for dumplings in Toronto.   After having tried dumplings from Mother's Dumplings a couple of times, I still stand by the belief that this restaurant offers some of the best dumplings a person can find in Toronto. While the restaurant has gone through some huge changes in last few years that varied from location to the size of its space, their dumplings are just as good as they have always been. The skin for the dumplings is neither too thick or too thin, making it easier to carry them around with chopsticks without bursting them while allowing them to have just the perfect amount of chewiness. Because of the skin that is thicker than the more conventional ones, the juice inside the dumplings are well-preserved, and will fill your mouth with incredible flavours as soon as you bite into one. The steam buns from there are also quite good, with their dough being perfectly tender and moist, with lots of favours to be discovered within.   The new restaurant is more visually pleasant, due to it being on the ground level and having renovated its new space before the opening. The dim lighting has long been replaced by brighter ones, and, with much bigger space, the restaurant is now available to customers coming in bigger groups (4+). With more servers and cooks, the speed of the service also increased quite drastically since before the changeover. Unfortunately, however, the quality of service has declined from being warm and friendly to superficial and even impatient on some occasions, such as the dinner rush hour. For example, the servers have the tendency to write down and hand out whatever their customers ordered, then ignoring them until they request for the bill. The most recent time I was there, I had to physically raise myself from the chair and wave frantically just to grasp one of the servers' attention.   Apart from the service being more or less non-existent between after getting food that you ordered and paying for your bill, Mother's Dumplings remains one of the best restaurants to go to for a wide variety of incredibly delicious dumplings. Whether you are new to Toronto or have been a resident for years, it is a rare, totally affordable treat that you should not miss out on."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Delicate and subtly flavored, but hearty and delicious. We seemed to be served by whoever was nearest rather than one person - I definitely loved the cooperative family atmosphere. There was a light, fragrant aroma to the dumplings, almost Jasmine or lavender like, barely perceptible but that absolutely made my meal. Service is sweet, portions are good, presentation great (adorable dessert dumplings!), food is fresh and delicious, and I LOVED watching the cute ladies make dumplings and wave at the babies brought by to watch.  I'll go against popular opinion here and say the chive pancake, while good, wasn't my favorite. But I loved the steamed bakchoi and mushroom.  This is a place I'm happy to recommend and revisit and give my money to! I foresee many a dumpling craving in my near future.  I will say the setting/dishes/condiments etc are rather dirty..."}
{"text":"My favourite place to take pals to who are visiting from out of town. The portions are huge and you are definitely getting bang for your buck. I always over-order here, so definitely try to pair down to maybe two dumpling orders and like, one big dish (their General Tso's chicken is my absolute favourite). Sometimes there's a super long wait, so it's best to go for a lunch date."}
{"text":"This was my first \"Dumpling Place\" and I thought the four dishes we had were superb, exotic and tasty, and reasonably priced. We had all vegetarian choices, and the food seems quite nourishing and delicious. Service was friendly and fast, even though they were swamped. Will return."}
{"text":"So after hearing of another place for dumplings I had to try it.  It's right on spadina on the north side of china town, so I figure it can't be too off right?  I immediately ordered 2 orders of the pork and chive dumplings and then an order of the fried pork and bok choy dumplings.  The surpassing thing for me is that they had a decent beer selection.  Everything from Mill St. beers to Sapporo to Yang Jing (which I found out is surpassingly good).  It kinda took forever for all the food to come out.  I guess it may be because they make everything right away... I would probably have a tiny stockpile ready to go, but I guess I came at a bad time?  Either way, it's china town... I wasn't really expecting good service anyways.  The dough for the steamed dumplings was pretty good.  Really thin, however it broke and wasn't sealed in certain places (rush job =/).  The pork filling was really rough and seemed like it was all lean pork (you really need the fat in this case).  Overall it wasn't exactly the best dumpling I've had.  The fried dumplings were a completely different ball park.  I actually kinda enjoyed them.  They aren't the big long ones that you get everywhere else, but rather the same dumpling shape that they make, just fried.  The filling was a bit more pleasant because the bok choy really made the filling more moist and smooth.    Another thing that bugged me was the prices of the dumplings.  I'm judging by the fact that I can get 16 really good dumplings for 4.99 uptown... These were 6.99 for 10... GAH!!!  Ya, I'm not making this trip down here again.  Check out the rest of my dumpling list for the hit list."}
{"text":"So I've finally found the one foodstuff I would prefer to have crammed in my maw than sushi.  And that foodstuff is dumpling.  And that maw is Ma's.  Mother's Dumplings is pretty much heaven in a reasonably-sized, kitschy Spadina street eatery.  I mean, if your idea of heaven is a place where nice waitresses present wicker steamers full of juicy pork buns to you all day long.  Which it really should be.  The buns split and dribble the most deliciously savory broth, while the pork and chive dumplings provide a bit more texture and crunch.    Vegetarians take heart!  The mushroom/chive/tofu dumplings were outstanding, and the Hot Pockets-style chive and egg pancakes were a tasty, doughy homoeopathic cure for hangovers-turned-brunch-food.  The tab, picked up my actual mother, was proclaimed \"very reasonable!\" considering we both had to be rolled out then and that the garlic burps only just dissipated about twenty minutes ago.  Indeed, like all good gifts from mom, we emerged sated, comforted, and only minorly self-loathing."}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation.  I was craving some dumplings, and dumplings I received!  I was a big fan of the fact that your dumplings not only come freshly made, but you could actually see them being made in front of your eyes.  The dumplings were tasty very juicy.  Unfortunately, that's about all the good I can say about Mother's Dumplings.    Their menu is fairly extensive in terms of dumplings.  And they are fairly cheap.  I wish there was an option for half orders though.  I was eating with my friend who was a vegetarian, and I wanted some meat options.  So I ended up ordering like 30 dumplings myself - way too much food.    The service wasn't very good either.  We sat ourselves and it took awhile to get anyone to pay attention to us to take our order, during our meal.    Beware of their online menu though.  It doesn't list their current selections, or their current prices.  I tried ordering a bunch of take out for an event I was throwing and what was listed online was completely wrong.    I would go back, but I'm sure there are other places that are better.  That being said, you may not get the freshness that is Mother's Dumplings."}
{"text":"Service can be hit or miss  They have installed buzzers on every table.  In theory, you press the button (Pay bill, order, cancel) someone is supposed to come.  But in reality, it doesn't work.  We came when it was busy and even though there were four servers, it clearly wasn't enough.  Tables needed to be bussed and people were waiting...  I'd read some people complained about luke warm food.  Which is weird since they make everything to order.  But yesterday, I saw it first hand.  All the dishes were waiting to be picked up, but servers didn't come get them in time.  We waited a long time for our tomato soup, which the server apologized for the wait.  the dumplings came out alot longer and one was just luke warm.  I looked back and saw a bunch of dishes just sitting there.  It would have been nice had our dumplings been piping hot rather than being luke warm and as we ate them they got cold...  We asked for the bill but the server forgot, so I spent alot of time waiting around and had to ask another time"}
{"text":"Good dumplings, but you have to eat them hot and fresh. Beef and celery is my dumpling of choice. Their beef soup has overcooked pieces of meat not to my liking. The BBQ pork buns were just OK. I've found the quality here uneven."}
{"text":"Came for lunch one day and it was busy but there is ample seating, I would say it's pretty good for groups. The service was decent. On to the food:  Pan fried pork shrimp melon dumplings: really enjoy the brown crust and juicy innards, a real treat. Could eat like 12 of these myself.   Lamb shiu mai: a powerful lamb flavour and really thick like they shoved a big meatball in there. Enjoyed it.  Pork and chive steamed dumplings: juicy and tasty, prefer pan fried but these a little healthier.  Bbq pork buns: nice and hot and full of flavour, a staple food for me!  Wonton soup: tasted healthy, and the soup looked nice and clean.   Overall a nice experience and would come back again."}
{"text":"We eat a lot of dumplings, but this time finally had the time to come back to this place after a very long time.  I would highly recommend the vegetable and noodle dumplings. Best I have ever had!  I also had the lamb siumai, and the other vegetarian dumplings, but I prefer the vegetable and noodle dumplings (boiled).  The green onion pancake is the perfect quantity, slightly dense though.  Definitely recommend this place for dumplings!"}
{"text":"The dumplings are just meh.  not a lot of flavour and pretty doughy. price wise on par with the other dim sum places I've tried. also didn't like that they refilled the tea with just hot water (and didn't add any more tea). It just tasted like hot water. Some of the steamed dumplings take longer to come out so order at least one thats boiled to start. I'd rather eat dim sum in richmond hill/markham (eg. Chinese Dumpling House)."}
{"text":"Dumplings were good but the service was bad.  Food came out slow and everyone got their food at different times.  Some had to wait 45 mins after others got their food.  Also they forgot one plate of dumplings but they were nice to give it to us for free when they realized the mistake.  We asked for separate bills at the start and at the end they gave us one big bill. There are better and cheaper dumpling restaurants in the area.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Mother's Dumplings is on several lists as the number one best or one of the five to eight absolute best Chinese restaurants in Toronto.  It is a perfectly respectable establishment - and it does what it does extremely well.  But I think part of the cult of Mother's Dumplings comes from the rarity of what it offers rather than the actual taste thrills themselves.  Mother's Dumplings is a Northeastern regional Chinese restaurant.  Manchurian food is hard to come by in the US and Canada.  So what they have at Mother's you will not easily find at competing restaurants.  Northeastern Chinese is the Chinese equivalent of British food.  Simple dishes based on the principles of good ingredients well prepared with a minimum of  ornamentation by the cook.  Dumplings are perfect dough - ground meat and one spice.  Pancakes have maybe two ingredients, one or both of which are bland.  It is hearty stuff - you fill up fast. It is total comfort food.  They offer condiments at the table to mix your own sauce to dip your dumplings or whatever into ...  and frankly you will need it.  In a Cantonese or Szechuan restaurant, the sauces will be complex, the ingredient lists will be long and flavors will move around as you eat your way through the dish.  Here - what you see is what you get.  So what makes Mother's so good?  a) Their dumping dough is magnificent. You will probably never get better dumpling dough in your lifetime.  b) The fillings do taste strongly of the one spice they put in the filling (dill, chives mushroom or whatever)   There are an awful lot of dumplings out there with mediocre dough and the filling has a restrained taste of steamed-out meat cut with steamed out cabbage.  In the dumpling horse race - Mother's wins by 88 lengths.  But even the best of Chinese dumplings are still the Cornish pasties of Asian food.  If you think Cornish pasties are the best food Europe has to offer, the French and the Italians would like to have a word with you."}
{"text":"Very good, freshly made dumplings. Siu lung bao were not the best I've had but I enjoy how everything is freshly made. I don't like how mainstream/white the place looks, but hey, oh well. No wait when we showed up, late afternoon. We also ordered black bean sauce and some noodle filled fried dumpling thing as well. Wished I could order more but we were too full to eat everything. Noodles were good, I could pass on the the fried dumpling but that's a matter of personal taste rather than execution. I would come back and try more dumplings here."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food on the Danforth even though quite dumpling oriented as the name says. Their boiled, steamed and pan fried dumpling varieties are all awesome, and they are made right on the spot.   They have dishes of Chinese food, for those who want something saucy and more substantial - like the Kung Pao Chicken. I haven't tried the noodle dishes, but they seem pretty substantial for the price. Actually, the main 'problem' with the dishes is that they are too big! If you go by yourself, there are very few dishes with less than 10-12 dumplings.  The service can be a bit slow, and the ambiance/cleanliness could go up too, but overall - the best Chinese food place on the Danforth :)"}
{"text":"Giving Mama a four star rating because I'm living in Chapel Hill right now and you CANNOT find any legit chinese food outside of Gourmet Kingdom, which only serves up Schezwan style goodness. So finding Mother's Dumplings was a godsend.  However...  I'm originally from San Gabriel, CA--part of the \"New Chinatown\" in Los Angeles where you can find dumplings sent down from the heavens by whoever your god is.   With that said, we ordered:  1) Juicy pork buns  Highlight of the meal. Flavor profile was perfect as you could taste the ginger and vinegar, but it wasn't over bearing. Only complaint--not as juicy as I hoped  2) Shrimp, pork, egg, and chive dumplings Very dry and unimpressive. Enough said.  3) Bak choi, mushroom, and tofu dumpling We ordered these because they were out of the other vegetarian dumplings but they turned out to be delicious! The mushroom to other ingredient ratio was just right.  4) The multigrain jook Very good, especially for a cold night like last night. Texture was excellent!  5) Green onion pancake  Small and not as flavorful as I expected.  Would I come here again? Probably not. I saw that there was a Din Tai Fung not too far from Toronto so that may be a better option. The one near San Gabriel, CA is absolutely the best so I expect the one here to be comparable."}
{"text":"Not the biggest fan of dumplings and thought this place could change my mind, but it did not! I might be a bit biased, but the dumplings weren't as good as I thought they'd taste. I ordered the Steamed Pork and chives dumplings and the Lamb Shui Mai dumplings. The Pork and Chives were a bit hard to finish as the taste quickly got sickening. The Lamb Shui had some sort of soup or liquid inside that I was not expecting. Both tasted very unique, but they simply weren't my cup of tea.   A plus for the place is that my friend and I were quickly seated upon entering and the place was quite packed! It was a very nice environment, but I do not think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Winner Winner Chicken Dinner  (no that's not right) Winner Winner Dumpling Dinner (aha much better)  This place really has some quite good dumplings.  My host took me here for a very tasty lunch.  We had a huge assortment of dumplings.  The clear winners were the pan fried pork dumplings, but all of the assortment we had were quite good.  The shrimp, egg, and chive ones were also tasty.  Careful, many of the dumplings are very hot!  A few of the steamed ones had some \"structural integrity\" problems...meaning they were pretty hard to extract intact from their neighbors.    The food was prepared fresh...we even had to wait a few minutes for one because they assembled the dumplings from scratch.  All of them ranged from good to excellent.  Service was prompt and friendly.  The atmosphere is pleasant as well.  And best of all, for more food than I even came close to needing, it was about $10.    Update 10/16: Well, I've found better dumpling places in town and I think their quality has started to suffer.  It's a cult-favorite, it's quick, and it's tasty, but it's definitely not as good as dumpling house."}
{"text":"Party of 6. 45 minute wait on a Friday night, but we really only waited less than 20 minutes. It certainly satisfied my dim sum fix. Since there were so many of us we got a bit of everything. Standouts for me were:  Pancakes - all of them are good  BBQ Pork Buns  Pork & Bok Choy Dumplings"}
{"text":"Dirty sticky all around bad bad bad. Do not recommend. As a matter of fact if the place gets gentrified the entire area would be a great thing."}
{"text":"I'm sorry.  But I was so disappointed by the service that I had today.  My friend and I went for lunch at 12 - we were actually a bit earlier than that so we got a seat quickly and ordered quickly.  However, none of our food came until 12:30 (beef noodles came around then).  We had to check up on them TWICE on our food.  The first time the waitress came around, she said that our food was coming soon -- the noodles came about 5 minutes later.  When we were done the noodles, we waited another 10 minutes.  I know dumplings dont' take THAT long to steam.  We then find out that they had forgotten our order and that they were going to steam it then.    Disappointed? Yeah.  Very much so."}
{"text":"Went to Mother's Dumplings tonight for my first ever dumpling and I can honestly say it was the best dumpling i've ever had. Even though this is a Chinese restaurant our server was a white guy but I think that just shows how diverse our country is and i am happy to live here it's 2016 get over it people. Will be telling my friends about this place xoxo!!"}
{"text":"We've been this place several times. Everything is yummy. Their dumplings are hand made. You can see them making dumplings in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I went to the place a few days ago with a friend of mine.  It's an alright place to go for authentic dumplings.    The wait was not long at all, the restaurant is longer than it looks from the outside.  I enjoy the fact that you can see the chefs making the food.  The dumplings were so-so to me, I wasn't wow'd by the flavour.  Perhaps I'm not so well versed in eating dumplings.  The presentation was not special at all.  I did enjoy the atmosphere, the waiting staff was very nice.  I'd come back here again, if I ever get that dumpling itch."}
{"text":"considering all the reviews, i would've expected more.  i mean, the food was good and all but not so great to justify the price in my opinion. especially the sweet buns were very underwhelming - basically just some lemon sponge cake and even the one filled with what was probably red bean paste tasted rather bland.  i also found it irritating that they would already bring main course AND dessert while i was waiting for my soup to reach a decent temperature after burning my tongue. if it would be maybe 60-70% of the current price, i would still consider going again but the way it is - no second time for me."}
{"text":"Incredible dumplings! I suggest the pan fried pork & bak choi especially.  The BBQ Pork Buns were outstanding. I could eat them for every meal.   The only reason I didn't give Mother's Dumplings a 5 star rating is because the waiter didn't tend to our table basically at all. We had to flag him down 3 times for drinks. Decor is lacking a little as well.   Otherwise, excellent restaurant. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My colleagues and I love coming here for simple delicious dumplings and noodles!  Everything tastes fresh.  The ambience is subpar but we come for the food! We just eat and get out!"}
{"text":"My friend who suggested our group to have a Chinese New Years dumplings dinner here because they are known for their inexpensive, freshly made in-house dumplings. Mother's Dumplings is a local favourite located in the China Town area and is also well-liked by many of the university students nearby as well.   We were able to get a seat for our party of 12 because we made the reservation beforehand. Otherwise, the wait would probably be very long given that it was a busy Saturday night. We were given a sheet to write down the items we want, kind of like ordering at a dimsum restaurant, and pass it to the server when we're done. Unlike many Chinese restaurants, here the servers have designated tables, like Western restaurants, so you can't just flag down any server who happens to walk by.   We ordered a bunch of stuff, like fried rice, dumplings, and soups.  The Shrimp Fried Rice barely had any shrimps in it and the Kimchi Fried Rice was not spicy as well, might as well call it \"cabbage fried rice\".  The soups were interesting...The Wonton Soup was fine and the wontons were quite tasty. However, the \"Dumpling Soup\" contained no dumplings at all! It was basically just seaweed soup. On the menu, it didn't mention that fact at all, and since we added the soups later on we didn't see the small line of text on the ordering sheet mentioning that the dumpling soup doesn't actually contain any dumplings. The dumplings tasted alright, it had a fair amount of meat filling and the dough was quite thin. However, it tasted too \"homemade\" and I was expecting a bit more from a restaurant well known for its dumplings. I have definitely been to restaurants with better tasting dumplings with better presentation in Toronto.   Overall it was pretty good CNY dumplings dinner and the bill came down to roughly $20 per person after tax and tips."}
{"text":"Best dumplings hands down in Toronto. Also love ordering the side order of kimchi for a spicy kick."}
{"text":"Love dumplings and was so excited when a Mother Dumplings opened around the corner from my house.  After a hit and miss couple of first tries right after they first opened, they have been delivering consistently yummy food and good service.  I'm a vegetarian and adore the kimchi (huge portion for $3), the smashed cucumber salad, and kimchi/mushroom/tofu dumplings."}
{"text":"Probably the best general tso chicken I ever had. The dumplings were also on point. The place gets pretty packed so if you are going with more than 4 people, make reservations/call ahead. I came here because of the recommendations from yelp and I can't wait to come back and have that general tso chicken again!!"}
{"text":"Had always heard good things about this place but had also never got around to going because I mistakenly thought that I wasn't a huge dumpling fan. Turns out I'd never had really good dumplings because OMG THESE DUMPLINGS. I only had vegetarian ones (of which there was a decent selection), but my omnivorous dinner companions said the meat ones were equally delicious."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Mother's Dumplings was in 2010 amidst growing demands for the restaurant. Back then, a regular Saturday meant a pretty much empty restaurant, with lots of seating. As I recall (which is not much) from that visit, the food was pretty average. So, I've gone back yesterday to reconfirm and to give the restaurant another chance after so many years. And unfortunately, my views have not changed...  On a Friday night, the restaurant is packed and bustling, with people waiting at the front of the restaurant trying to get a seat. We reserved a seat of 7, and the staff was decently accommodating of that request. First thing I've noticed sitting down, is the same decor and ambience as of 6 years ago. While I realize this is a simple restaurant in Chinatown, the space definitely needed a good wipe down, as it's visibly covered in dust and chipped painted walls.  And then the food came...I'm natively from Beijing, so I understand the culture and practices for making authentic and delicious dumplings, and these were FAR off. Some may argue that the authenticity comes from the lack of MSG and use of proper filling, but not only were the dumplings soggy (pan fried ones), they lacked so much flavour that you'd think you're suppose to derive all the flavours from the dipping soy sauce and vinegar. We also went for some entrees to start the meal (General Tso Chicken/Stir Fry Green Bean). The batter on the general tso was not cooked completely through, giving a \"pasty\" interior taste to the dish. Furthermore, the sauce was lazily mixed with what seems to be soy sauce, sugar, and vinegar. No signs of aromatics like garlic, ginger etc.  But let's focus back on the dumplings. The steamed dumplings where not only terribly formed, but they simply lacked the sustenance and traditional flavours that you would find in any authentic dumpling restaurants. Even the meal itself was unforgiving to the wallet, coming at a whopping $30 per person for a meal that left some wanting for more. Clearly this restaurant has gotten ahead of itself and driving prices due to it's popularity.   Sorry Mother's Dumplings, maybe another 5 years...maybe..."}
{"text":"Walking down Spadina in search of lunch led us to Mothers Dumplings. It was quite packed, a good sign of good food. It also meant a bit of a wait for good food too! Greeted warmly, we were seated in a booth with menus and hot tea. I was in the mood for soup and my eyes landed on the Da-Lu noodles a Northern Chinese comfort food that was worth every slurp... Especially when paired with the steamed pork and chive dumplings -- a good choice"}
{"text":"Some pretty good vegan and vegetarian options available. The food was yummy and service prompt. My biggest complaint is that it was hot inside and no A/C (or it wasn't turned on) and the front windows open. Far too warm to not have A/C on which made the end of the meal very unpleasant.  I'll definitely be back but only in cooler weather or if there is A/C.  Note: Entrance is barrier-free but washrooms in basement."}
{"text":"Eh, this place is okay. I suppose a sign to look out for is whether there are any chinese people eating here and that is a no which is probably a bad indicator. Tried a lot of the dumplings with my friends today, we got the steamed shrimp and egg which were not good, just kind of bland and tasteless and the dumplings are disappointingly tiny.   Next we had the pan fried celery and beef dumplings which had a decent flavor and great crunch but again lacked any sort of depth of flavor, it was just salty, and once you dipped it in vinegar it was salty and sour, there was no meaty juice or anything in the dumpling, though they were served fresh out of the pan and piping hot which was good.   Next came the boiled pork and chives dumplings which were the ones I had definitely been anticipating, these were okay at best, they were overboiled and the skin fell apart from the ball of meat, and again it lacked a \"meat\" flavor, all it had was a sort of salty savory flavor that wasn't completely satisfying and definitely did not leave me yearning for anything more.  We also had a few extra dishes like the vegetarian steamed bao and the beef and onion fried pancakes which again lacked any sort of luster.   With all these seemingly below average review you'd think Mother's Dumplings would get a 2 star at max but there were 2 really redeeming qualities that Mother's Dumplings had.   We ordered an extra side dish of the five spice beef, and this was actually fantastic, easily 4.5/5 stars for this dish alone though it doesn't balance out the terrible averageness of the other dishes. It was flavorful, quite salty but it actually had a good depth of flavor from the five spice, in addition to that it wasn't boiled too long or too little time and hence the lines of elastic tendon within the meat had kept their integrity and were slightly chewy and sprung back up as you bit on it without giving the feeling of chewing on a rubber band, the meat was also soft, not dry or anything. Fantastic dish though small portions for the price you pay.   Also our server, Hatsumi/Natsumi (i forgot whether it was an H or an N) was very accommodating, and was just generally quite wonderful."}
{"text":"When you're visiting an \"authentic\" Chinese restaurant you would think it's going to be great, but unfortunately this was far from it. The first course consisted of \"soup dumplings\" that were so shriveled they resembled more of a pork dumpling, with shit tons of ginger. The shrimp and chive dumplings were topped off with a hair (photo attached) and when I told the server he did nothing. I had to ask for another plate, and comps? Yea nothing there.  The cherry on the sundae was the salty beef and broccoli served with undercooked rice. Honestly, what Chinese restaurant fucks up white rice? Add on a store bought teriyaki sauce and there was my meal. Shit show to say the least and the wait staff did nothing.   TLDR:Stop by if you want hair on your food, raw rice, and incompetent servers. But come for the tea! That was great"}
{"text":"For over ten years, I've been going to Mother's Dumplings. I remember when it was located at a small shop on Huron north of Dundas. It was busy then, and even now after it's been on Spadina for years, it's still busy.   What's interesting is that over the years, I've ended up ordering their veggie options more often than their meat options. The meat option is pretty good as well, but their veggies ones are *really* good!  They make the dumplings right there, it seems. I love the view at the staff rolling the dumplings. They're so fast at it.  But keep in mind, because it's usually pretty busy around lunch time (and sometimes dinner time) you might still have to wait for a table and food sometimes. Service can be slow at times as well...for example, you might ask for tea and it might come twenty minutes later, sometimes after the food is already delivered to the table and nothing to drink.  Keep in mind, they take cash or debit. You can also buy frozen ones to take home and cook yourself later."}
{"text":"Okay dumplings. I am still searching for the 'best' soup dumplings in Toronto...Markham has a few good spots, though. I digress...  Ordered:  Pan fried pork and chives (ok...nothing special) Juicy buns (I am always fooled by juicy buns (hahaha) because it's supposed to be similar to soup dumplings but soup is either leaked out or never evident) Green onion pancakes (not too greasy, pretty tasty) Steamed beef and chives (not a favorite at the table)   I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again...there is a better dumpling spot down on Gerrard. Total cost came to 30 bucks with 10 dumplings for each order except for the juicy buns which were 8 pcs. Service was good and I appreciate a spot that gives a jug of cold water to each table...I drink A LOT of water."}
{"text":"Truly authentic Chinese dumplings! The Garlic Bok Choi and the dumplings both reminded me of my mom's cooking (I am Taiwanese). Service was so-so. Our waiter was impatient and not friendly. The other waitstaff seemed to be more pleasant, so I'll chalk it up to drawing the short straw."}
{"text":"Yum! Their dumplings here are just so fresh!!   I came here with a friend on a Friday afternoon a little past lunch time and it was still busy and packed. We got the pork dumplings and the dill dumplings and the hot and sour soup. Everything was delicious perfection. The dill dumplings was the first time I had them and it was a pleasant  surprise. Totally different from the napa and park filled I'm used to. We also tried the onion pancake. This dish didn't stand out as much. It wasn't very flavourful at all.   Price was decent. About $25 for two people"}
{"text":"Atmosphere - I really like how it was designed.  From the table and chairs to the ceiling decor, I felt like I was in China enjoying a cup of tea.   Service - I'm use to service with a smile.  Not happy to see us at Mother's Dumpling, but most servers were always ready to assist and take our orders.  Truthfully, that's all that matters when it comes down to dining in the restaurant.    Dumplings - I really thought this would be the place that I would have the BEST and most memorable dumplings in my lifetime.  That was not the case.  It was nothing special.  Just like any dumplings that I've tasted.  The biggest disappointment was their soup dumplings (xia long bao) was empty.  There was no soup in there at all.  What is that?!!!    Audience - yes, we had an audience.  It was pretty cool that we got to see the cooks making the dumplings.  It was NOT so cool when they continued to stare at us and smiling throughout the entire time.  *Yes, yes, we are out of towners.  Now stop staring and make your dumplings.*"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat and we decided to sample a bunch of items off the menu. Everything we had was delicious and tasted exactly the same as the other location in Chinatown. The only negative is they didn't have everything on the menu available.   This location isn't as popular as the Chinatown location so it is much easier to get a seat, but it only makes sense if you're in the east end."}
{"text":"A place to go with at least 3 friends and order 2 types of dumplings each and mix and match. Great add to the Danforth and food is good as it's Chinatown based original location"}
{"text":"Visiting this place mid-afternoon on a Saturday.  Was pretty quiet.  Service was friendly and fast, and food arrived piping hot.  Had pork and dill boiled dumplings, steamed juicy pork buns, and pan fried pork and bok choi dumplings.  All were great, but only order the pork and dill if you really like dill!  Great place to satisfy your dumpling craving."}
{"text":"Good place with a wide variety of dumplings for those who eat meat and those who are vegetarian.  I've been here twice with a coworker of mine and both times we had ordered the pork and chives steamed dumplings, vegetable steamed dumplings, and the onion pancake.  I think it's a great place for lunch and to share with a group of people.  However, it does get kind of boring after eating your 6th dumpling in a row (I believe it comes with a dozen dumplings).  The decor was decent..nothing fancy.  At first glance, it looks like a small place, but if you walk further into the restaurant, there's an area with more tables and even couches.  I also like that you can see the chefs making the dumplings from scratch in the kitchen.  I'm no longer working in that area, but my old coworker and I have already discussed that the next time I visit Spadina & College, we'll be going back to Mother's Dumplings for lunch!"}
{"text":"Some people recommended this place, I tried it and got so FRUSTRATED.  The only 2 stars that I'm giving is one for the service, that was okay, and I didn't wait much to be seated. And one for the bun with beef that I liked. The rest was awful, I ordered the pan fried beef dumpling and it was really chewy and mushy, it seemed that was fried before and they just warmed up to serve us. I asked the server and she said that it was fresh. The boiled dumpling was tasting absolutely nothing. I had tried dumpling in lots of different places, but this place was not great at all.  Ps.: An outburst.. Sometimes I just feel that if I'm not Asian and I go eat at this kind of places, they treat me as I don't know anything about their food and they can serve me any shit and I won't realize that it's not fresh, or not good or whatever."}
{"text":"I was here on a Thursday night at 7pm and this place was Packed with a line up almost out the door. Luckily they take reservations and we had a table waiting for us when we arrived.  The dumplings are the star here coming in Pan fried, steamed and boiled variety. And man are they good! Homemade, right in front of you they are as delicious as I've ever had (Ok, Not as good as my moms but still very good).   My Favorites on the menu are Pork and Dill Dumplings, Pork and Vegetable Steamed Buns and also the Green Onion Pancakes all made in house!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a dumpling fix at any time of the day!"}
{"text":"Overrated in my opinion. They have a decent selection but most of the dishes are on the pricey end for the quality you are getting. The dumplings had fairly thick skin which sort of depends on your preference.   We came on a Tuesday night and it was quite busy with a short line up for our seats. Although the servers were very nice, they didn't have enough of them. We struggled to get our tea, order and get our bills during our visit.  I'm a bit spoiled with Chinese food being up in Markham, so I likely won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Best dumplings I have ever had! They have about 4 veggie options. They often run out of dumplings toward the end of the day though so you might be forced to choose from 1 or 2 (instead of those 4, I mean).  I love their noodles too, but not the homemade ones (they are too soft). I think they are called Dai Lu.  The only thing that prevents me from eating here everyday is that the service is extremely slow. And it's cash-only."}
{"text":"The menu says 12 boiled dumplings, but you roll the dice each time you order.  You'll never get less than 12, but I've seen plates with up to 15, and everything in between.  It's worth noting, however, that the boiled dumplings aren't all that great.  And the oily hot sauce doesn't do it for me - I prefer the thinker chunky version I can really wrap around my dumplings.  That being said, their more expensive steamed dumplings are fantastic."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been catching Sunday brunch here for the past few weeks. The restaurant was super cute, and is actually very nice on the inside. I usually like to get a seat right next to the window for a Sunday brunch - it's usually relatively empty on Sunday afternoons but I've definitely walked past it at times when it's been crowded to the brim with people waiting outside. The dumplings are awesome - I'm very partial to fried dumplings in general, and these do not disappoint. I was a little sad that they didn't have a pork-only option, but the pork and cabbage ones I had were still delicious. Got the wonton soup as well  - delicious, with seaweed and green onions in salty broth, it actually was how mom used to make them.  The waiters are super nice and very personable, and the staff are all very friendly and will make an effort to get you what you want. The cucumber salad is awesome, especially on a hot summer day.  My only complaint was that service is very slow, especially if you order any of the dumplings or steamed goods - the people around me were also waiting for quite a bit after their order was put in, and I definitely had to wait for a good 15 minutes before my order of wonton soup arrived."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and environment is nice as well. Delicious dumping with reasonable price. I always come at noon, it is one of my favourite lunch place in Chinatown.   But the problem is, why there are only one or two waiters service all desks? They are super busy and the waiting time is long. Please improve service."}
{"text":"Despite the amount of praise that Mother's Dumplings has, and with what they proudly proclaim on their menu, as one of the best Chinese restaurants in town, they are simply average.  When I came in, there was a line-up of people. A customer was leaning against the string curtain and that customer was quickly berated by the waiter who became our server.  The waiter spoke in a very condescending tone and to be frank, the food was not good enough to justify that. The service to the table was middling and Victor, our waiter, was not exactly the best at being slightly reminiscent of a server.  I asked the waiter if the cabbage dumplings were made using napa cabbage, he told me it was made of cabbage. I asked again, and he said just cabbage. Now, I took it as a gut instinct that it was actually made out of napa cabbage because I never heard of dumplings being made out of normal cabbage... and I was correct. Victor was wrong. Their dumplings are made of napa cabbage.  The dumplings themselves were middle of the pack. I would maybe give this restaurant another shot, but I think there are better dumpling restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"OMGeee I have finally made it to a Toronto must.  Let me tell you amazing does not seem to capture what we ordered and I consumed.  The steamed dumplings were amazing.  My favourites are the:  melon tofu, shrimp & chives, pork & chives, the smashed cucumber salad, fried long green beans (they had pork mixed with them), and the fried pancake.  There was tonnes of leftovers, I'm not usually one for left overs but this is something I truly recommend as they are even better the next day!  If you have not checked this place out I suggest you make it your next restaurant to visit post haste!"}
{"text":"I went to the actual real Mother's Dumpling on Spadina and they are both fantastic!  Just a little note though, the soup dumplings @ mother's dumplings are actually dumplings in soup versus the northern style soup in dumplings."}
{"text":"You know...this place is ok.  It's not bad, it's not great, it's really is just okay.    \"WTF??!  WHY?? IT HAS SUCH HIGH RATINGS!!\"  Well, dear reader, lemme tell ya:   - xiao long bao aka \"the soup dumpling\".  I LOVE these.  If I could be reincarnated as any type of dumpling, it'd be these little fellas.  I've eaten them at one of the most famous restaurants for them in Shanghai, their birthplace, so I know good soup dumplings.   What I got at Mother's Dumplings were no doubt very tasty...but not good examples of soup dumplings.  They were overcooked, the dough completely fell apart, there was little if any soup inside...just a giant sad face.   Not only that, but the restaurant does not even supply you with proper eating utensils and condiments for it.  No soup spoon?  No pickled ginger?  Those are ESSENTIALS!  It's dumpling blasphemy.    - The wonton soup.  Yeah yeah wonton soup or whatever dumpling soup it was called.  The dumplings were delish (pickled cabbage and pork if memory serves me right), but the broth was completely bland.  I actually added soy sauce to it to make it feel like I wasn't drinking flavored water.  Boo.    Everything else was fine!  Tasty and fresh steamed and boiled dumplings.  Can't argue there.  It was really the soup and the soup dumpling that killed me.  But, otherwise, pretty standard."}
{"text":"We ended up here at 9:30 right before closing. We had the pork buns, fried pork and bok choi dumplings, a small salad (which was seaweed, kimchi and picked radish), and an eggplant dish. The dumplings were, not surprisingly, the best part. The soup dumplings burst in your mouth with a hot flavorful bite and the and the pork dumplings were fried and tasty. The rest of our order could have been left alone.   I've eaten here twice now. It is one of the more non-asian friendly restaurants in Chinatown. It is clean, service isn't fast, but it isn't terribly slow, and it tells you what the specialty is right up on the door. The real downside is that they charge you pretty steeply because of this. $7.50 or $8.00 for an order of dumplings and it would take 3 or 4 to fill up two people.   I think the food is fine, but it isn't a great value and there are so many other restaurants in the area to explore."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.Service here is awful... We went to this restaurant early today and I asked nicely if they accept debit card since I knew from experience in some part of china town you have to pay cash and the manager responded they do accept Canadian issued debit card. Surprisingly after we were sat down the manager came to me and rudely asked to see my debit card even though I told them I have Canadian debit card. I got so upset that I told him it's rude to see someones debit card but he didn't care and said \" you can leave if you want to\" and so I did.  I would never go back again."}
{"text":"First of all: their new address is 421 Spadina Ave @ College St.   Second: well, I wasn't very sure about this \"dumpling thing\" when I got there with a friend... I ordered some kimchi just to be sure there would be something I'd enjoy in my meal.   The waitress quickly brought a teapot full of a delicious jasmine tea. I'm a tea lover and couldn't stop drinking it.   Then, the dumplings (some call them gyoza) arrived. I tried different versions - meat, vegetarian and shrimp, all boiled. I loved each one of them, and, for my surprise, at the end there was no dumpling left.   I strongly suggest going there early if you are with a big group, because the place has not that many seatings. I'd go with a lot of people to order different types of dumplings and taste one of each!   If you are a fan of spicy food, don't forget to try them with soy and vinegar and add some hot sauce. It's delicious.   The service is fast and very good. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Growing up in East Asia, the food quality here is just mediocre. Some food were a bit over cooked and hard. The dumplings didn't have much flavor. It's like eating lots of dough with little vegetables inside. The service was not that good either. Waited forever for our food and water was never refilled. The food was quite pricy, they also forcibly included 15% tip on the check, which was unreasonable, especially for a bad service."}
{"text":"3.5/5 - My usual dumpling place was closed in Chinatown so I decided to make the trek to Mothers Dumplings. It wasn't bad, I really enjoyed the chicken and mushroom steamed dumplings. The pan fried ones were okay, I got the pork and bak choy. My girlfriend thought that the food was decent as well but nothing to rave about. I think its a decent spot if you want a quick, cheap meal in Chinatown but I do prefer my usual spot."}
{"text":"Came here twice because I couldn't get enough of their pan seared dumplings and kimchi fried rice!!!! Omggggg!!!  Lord have mercy.  It was so delicious, I devoured it in 5 minutes.  You can eat your brains out for under $30 bones for two people easily.  I think I'm gonna go again and eat more.  Let's get fat together!!!!!!! Nom Nom Nom!!!!!    The hardest part is making sure you and your party eat equal amounts of dumplings.  You always think when you sit down \"okay, I'm gonna make sure this time, I eat just as much, or more\" and remind yourself you're gonna split it own the middle but once the dumplings hits your table, the gun goes off and your brain gets short circuited and you basically lose all train of thought and you become an animal.  I don't know what else to say.  Somethin about the vinegary soy sauce gets me all the time.  I even tried ordering double the amount of dumplings so we can eat like fat pigs and it always amazes me how much more I can keep shoving into my big mouth! HAHAHAHAHA"}
{"text":"The dumplings are great, no doubt about it. Everything we had was very good. I know a lot of places around here do cash only or only Canadian debit, this place accepts U.S. debit as well.   If you like having table service where you can go over the menu and get feedback from the servers, have your glass refilled promptly and be checked in on consistently, then this place is not for you.  The hostess acknowledged us quickly, sat us down and handed us little menu order forms to fill out. You check the boxes.    They offered tea, but it was way too strong. I guess I should have removed the leaves.   The food took a while, which I completely understand, everything is handmade, you see the workers making dumplings. But I don't understand why no one checked on us or why it took so long to get the bill.  The servers were curt and in a hurry."}
{"text":"Found this place before my trip to Toronto, and bookmarked it as a place I want to try.   But I didn't realize it MOVED based on the directions given to me by YELP. It led me to another dumpling place on Huron the original location I'm guessing 'FAMILY DUMPLING HOUSE'  (also decent), so just wandering around Chinatown some more we saw the holy grail on SPADINA near College.   The trip I had was in search for the BEST DUMPLINGS in Chinatown.  Please note I am a seasoned vet and have been eating a large assortment of dumpling all my life.   I was in heaven when first walked in and smelled that this place does exist and is for REAL.  It looks like they just move there with a pool table and couches in the back. But in the front it looks like a typical Chinese restaurant.   We ordered the Pork and Chives and Pork and pickled cabbage in whole wheat.  10 pieces for $6.25 steamed - It was no joke how good it was..  The pork chive was perfect in the regarding of the dough's texture firm but not hard. The filling was just good not salty at all.    The pork pickled cabbage was incredibly tasty as well. I never had my dumplings in whole wheat but I am a fan now. A little crispy when you bite into it, but it is a good health alternative for your traditional flour dumpling.   This place is the best, I would definitely recommend people to come here and experience how dumpling should be made. =)"}
{"text":"Soup dumplings were better than the steamed pork and chive, but enjoyed both. Dumpling house down the street seems superior. This place is a little depressing inside but I know people don't come for the ambience. Cash only."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice, so this review will be based on both visits. The first time I went, it was a cold day during winter so we wanted to go to someplace that was close. We decided to drop by here since we heard their dumplings were good. When we sat down and looked at the menu, the dumplings were actually a lot pricier than expected and being on a student budget, we decided to go with something else. I ended up getting a thick noodle soup with mushrooms and shredded pork and such. For a cold day, it was good. Portions are large. However, it was just good. There was nothing special about it. Fast forward to my second visit. This was absolutely terrible. I went back in Spring and I ordered rice and mapo tofu. Absolutely disgusting. Taking a picture would not do it justice. The place wasn't very busy but that did not give them an excuse to serve less than mediocre quality food. I am chinese and have been eating rice for my entire existence, and the minute I had the rice they served, I knew it was overnight. It was probably refrigerated, and they merely microwaved it and served it to me. The mapo tofu barely had any meat and was so salty, I thought they accidentally poured salt in. Mind you, mapo tofu is meant to be salty but this...this was exceptionally salty. The service was also mediocre. Never go during a down time, no one will be there to serve you and the food will be terrible. If you decide to go, go when it's busy."}
{"text":"I cant say that these dumplings are thee best in town since I was just visiting Toronto for days. I have no complaints. Service was decent and food was delicious! We first ordered the kim chee and it was something different compared to back home. It had a sweet taste to it. Next up was the shrimp and pork dumplings. I loved them not a bad for a mix of the two meats. The dumpling soup was sort of misleading. There were no dumpling in them so that was a disappointment for me."}
{"text":"Came here years ago with people from work when it was back on Huron st. A bunch of people at work swore by the place, so we went there for a work celebratory lunch. The food was excellent and I had to come back. The green onion pancake haunted my dreams. Since then, I have come pack 20 or more times, and taken handfuls of new people to it. Everyone has always enjoyed the pancake, and I can only recall one person not enjoying it. (but she was 23 and had no taste... she said she preferred New Ho King across the st, which I had the other week and it was nasty).  Overall the best things to order are the dumplings. They are made fresh and you can see them being made as the kitchen is behind glass. My favourites are the beef and chive, and whole wheat ones with the pickled cabbage. These dumplings pack flavour.  I will admit, I have had bad service there before in a large group... not very friendly for large groups. Looking for a place to take a first date? And you are in yours 20s and you are short on cash, but want a tasty meal? This place is for you."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this restaurant due to the great reviews. However, upon trying, I wish we'd tried some of the other many dumpling/dimsum places in Toronto. I went at around 2 PM on a Saturday and the restaurant was still bustling. We were able to get seated pretty quickly, but the ordering/getting food process took a while. We ordered a set of steamed mushroom dumplings and steamed pork/pickled cabbage (on whole wheat) dumplings. The prices are pretty reasonable so we also got a set of egg and chive pancakes.   The steamed mushroom dumpling was pretty good. However, the whole wheat pork and pickled cabbage dumpling was awful. The whole wheat wrapper made the dumpling dry and the whole ensemble lacked flavor (I went through 2 full sauce trays of soy sauce/vinegar in order to make it decently savory). The egg and chive pancakes are more like fried empanadas than pancakes and were decent (though oily). It came out after we had already finished the dumplings.   If you have a decent appetite, expect to 1.5-2 trays of steamed dumplings before you are full. DON'T get the whole wheat dumpling, it's very dry. From what I saw, the fried dumplings were actually very juicy and looked half-way decent.   The meal took me about 1.5 hrs, expect the service to be a bit slow."}
{"text":"One person, Friday lunch, no reservations.  Got there at 12 before the lunch rush and placed my order: soup-filled pork dumplings and pork steamed bun. Food was very slow to come out and I watched other tables get there food and leave. Window areas are seated first to make it look full.  The food was good, but the dumplings had already broken and lost its soup before I had a chance to open and eat it."}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch with two friends. We got quick and friendly service. We ordered some spring rolls, fried rice, kimchi, seaweed salad, and a whole bunch of delicious dumplings to share. Everything was flavourful, enjoyable, and affordable. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"This place was a nightmare!! I asked for a glass and they gave me a mason jar.  Then I asked for a picther of water and they gave me an ACTUAL water bottle that you would use while training at a gym."}
{"text":"I just don't understand why this restaurant seems always quite packed. Maybe the day I went here a few years ago, someone new was cooking? It was simply horrible. I'm sorry to say this, but the dumplings (I don't remember what I ordered) tasted like vomit. I strongly remember that for sure. I really felt ripped off when I was paying for the bill. Since then, every time I pass by this restaurant, I can't help wondering how people enjoy food here. It's a mystery to me..."}
{"text":"All the dumplings are fresh and tasty, and the service is great as well. The only draw back I could tell is that not all their soup dumplings had soup in them, but the ones that did were great!"}
{"text":"turns out, funny story, the dumplings are really good here."}
{"text":"I have had better frozen dumplings from T&T. The service was very slow today even though the restaurant was half full for lunch. I was thoroughly disappointed with the lack of flavour from the dumplings. The boiled pork dumplings with chives was very bland and same with the fried pancake with beef and green onions. When the juicy pork steamed dumplings arrived (supposed to be filled with soup), we asked for spoons, but the spoons never came. Therefore, I had to get the spoons myself. Since we had to wait for the spoons, the dumplings got cold, which we had to hail down the server. She re-steamed them, but they began to leak, so there was no soup in the soup dumplings. The ones that were intact had very little soup in them.   We tried to pay the bill, but no one came, so we had to walk up to the cash register to pay for our meal. I am usually very understanding regarding busy servers during lunch hour because I was a server through out university. However, the service was severely lacking for a restaurant that was half full. You have to write down your own order, someone takes the paper from you, and 25 minutes later someone brings you food.  I have had better frozen dumplings, and the service was terrible. I would not come back again."}
{"text":"The \"mother\" in \"Mother's Dumplings\" is truly reflective of the homey feel of their food, for which I was grateful. Coming from the North York-Markham area leaves me really disappointed in the Chinese options downtown sometimes, despite living near a so-called \"Chinatown\", whose variety seems to consist of Vietnamese food and Southern Chinese cuisine in shades varying from gross to mediocre to okay.  So of course I was pretty excited when I found out about Mother's Dumplings, with advertised Northern Chinese fare and specialising in dumplings! I love my Cantonese dim sum as much as the next person but yay! finally some taste of home.  I wasn't disappointed. The interior and food actually reminds me of some restaurants I've eaten at in China. The food is also comparable -- not the best I've ever had, but a good an option as any in Toronto. You can taste the homemade-ness in these dumplings (in a good way). The skins are thick but not too thick and come in piles of 20 or something just like at my mom's dinner parties. The flavours they come in are also standard Northern Chinese fare, including my favourite (pork & chives) and my least favourite (dill). Their zhajiangmian is not bad and the scallion pancakes OK too, but the dumplings are definitely best.  The atmosphere is actually better than most Chinatown restaurants (not including the shiny new young people teashops of course). I mean, don't have crazy expectations or anything but there's space and a bit of decoration and colour. Service is OK -- what you'd expect from most Chinese restaurants. Nothing to write home about but nothing to complain about either. I once went their with some friends just when they were supposed to be closing (we didn't realise this since there were still people inside finishing up their food) and they took us in anyway and let us get in the last order.  So yeah, whether they compare to your own mother's dumplings (if she makes any) is probably dependent on your mother, but overall this place is relatively great!"}
{"text":"Four of us recently went to this restaurant for lunch. It was incredibly busy which I thought was a good sign....We waited quite a while just to get the menus and waited even longer before our lunch arrived. I found the prices to be incredibly overpriced without the food to back up. I think charging $8.99 for a box Choi dish with garlic is incredibly overpriced. I also found the dumplings ranging between nine and $10 for dumplings way too expensive. There are so many other good restaurants in the area to choose from, I would never return to this one again. When the soup arrived at was only lukewarm and not particularly tasty. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. It is too busy, too overpriced and the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Mothers dumplings is a tradition for me and my family around Christmas time. They have great dumplings both meaty and vegetarian that are handmade in store while you watch. They are quick, affordable but mostly tasty. The chive, pork, and shrimp dumplings are great but the beef and green onion is even better! But one of their best dishes isn't even a dumpling... Its the sauteed eggplant stir fry. A definite must try. We also had some noodle soup and plain congee (add your favorite seasoning!). There is also a salad that is somewhat Korean in flavor and design: smashed cucumber salad. It provides a fresh bite to clean your palate.   We had three kids with us and one of their highchairs was not acceptable. Loose legs that felt like they might fall out at any moment and a broken strap that is very necessary for safety didn't make us feel very comfortable but they are kid friendly.  The food is relatively quick because its usually steamed. The back area past the noodle making stations/employees is quiet but also slightly drafty from the back door and can be occasionally ignored or forgotten.  For 5 adults and 3 young kids it was $76+tax&tip."}
{"text":"The dumplings are the best I've ever had. Fresh, cooked to order and oh-so flavourful! Great with vinegar and hot chili oil. The boiled are actually the best, and I've never gone wrong with the chives and noodles flavour. Pork and dill, shrimp egg and chives and the one with the radish are also good choices. Don't order anything else - all the dishes are ok, but the dumplings really shine.   There are a number of bad reviews here, and I'm suspect it has to do with expectations. I agree that the service is less than stellar, but that's not particularly conventional (or important) at a cheapie dumpling joint. Regardless, there's always the option of buying and making the frozen dumplings at home if you're bothered by waiting for food.   Dollars: $25 for three orders of dumplings and (free) tea."}
{"text":"The place was so disappointing. It did not taste like pork soup bum at all!!! No soup, wired stuffing. Not worth the money.  The beef pancake was okay but the sauce was too salty, and not house made."}
{"text":"Dumplings are good, no nonsense. I'd avoid the pancakes, they're a ripoff.  I get the steamed pork and chives every time."}
{"text":"There is something comforting about this place - especially the lamb jaozi.  Not the fastest service in the world, but brings back of lot of memories devouring platters of this luscious (and highly carb./oily) indulgence.  The lamb is finely minced with the tiniest pieces of onion and/or a green vegetable/seasoning.  Love it.  Reminds me of Xi'an, in Shanxi Province, China.  The best lamb everything!  Mmmmm ...  Great place to go after a show if you're hungry and in need of sustenance."}
{"text":"Not good. Skin breaks so easily, dumplings are kind of dry. Service isn't the best. They don't even provide spoons for xiao long Bao soup dumplings. This place is only for non-Asians that don't know what good dumplings are. Prices are sky high for what you get. Would not ever come back."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to an all-dumpling dinner at Mother's, but sadly left unsatisfied.   My table started with a delicious beef noodle soup, in which the meat was uncharacteristically tender. I had two bowls, and wished I'd ordered more noodles.  I followed the soup with a beef and onion pancake, thanks to recommendations here on Yelp. It was fine... and that's about all I can say. Like most of the food at Mother's, it didn't stand out.  We also ordered pork and vegetable steamed buns, pork, shrimp and melon dumplings, and a third dumpling in whole wheat. I ate here last night and I can't remember our order, that's how dull the food was! I tried one of each (and couldn't finish my bun), then went back to the noodles. It seems like the vegetables and herbs are given too much of the heavy lifting, flavour-wise.  The portions may be generous (particularly the gigantic steamed buns), but my friends and I were unable to finish due to a lack of enthusiasm."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's excellent to get your dumpling fix on. But things have changed over the years. The popularity and hipsters have ruined this place. It's too busy now and prices have gone up a little too much.   I miss the good old days."}
{"text":"This place had decent dumplings for a very inexpensive price. They weren't the best that I've ever had, but far from the worst. We started with the potato pancake which was just ok, but the shrimp, chive, and egg dumplings and the BBQ pork buns were good. Service was friendly and fast and our entire meal was just $18."}
{"text":"This establishment is extremely over-hyped by Toronto yelpers; I'm tempted to give it a 1* just to bring down the ratings a little bit, but alas, I'll try to be impartial.  I was debating between Mother's and Dumpling House (which I like), but eventually decided with Mother's.  A part of me knew that I would be disappointed when I stepped inside, the place is too clean, a sign that it attempts to cater to 'foreigners' (non-Chinese).  Ordered: - boiled: shrimp, pork, egg & chives - pan fried: pork and bok choi - steamed: pork and pickled cabbage (whole wheat)  Problems: 1. All of the fillings were lacking flavours, everything was extremely bland (either poor quality ingredients, incorrect ratios, or an attempt to cater to foreigners).   2. The skin was extremely thick.  The restaurant probably doesn't pay the rollers enough for them to do a good job. 3. The whole-wheat dumplings suffer from both 1 and 2, there was not a hint of picked cabbage inside, and the dough was extra thick because whole wheat typically requires more rolling."}
{"text":"Amazing quality food, the dumplings are made fresh and the best in the city! Some of the dishes tastes like the way my mom made them for my brother and I when we were kids. Brought back so many great memories. The service here is terrific. Very friendly and unexpected in Chinatown. I work at a hotel and when the guests want good Chinese food, I send them here. This is the authentic stuff right here!!"}
{"text":"Mother's dumplings hit the spot. The service isn't as bad as everyone's making it out to be, but c'mon you're eating dumplings and paying next to nothing. I was very pleased to have been seated right away and ordered the lamb siu mai, pork and chive dumplings, and the pan-fried pancake with shrimp, egg and chive. The siu mai were so rich and juicy, and the pork and chive dumplings had perfectly thin skin with a flavorful aromatic filling. We were in a bit of a rush, so by the time the panfried cakes arrived we had to pack them up and go. But let me tell you, those did not make it even half-way home. Very excited to return with a bigger group so we can try even more varieties of these delicious dumplings."}
{"text":"Quite a varied menu but only sampled a couple of items. Dumpling soup with no dumplings!! Tasty but slightly overpowered by cilantro. Green onion pancake was also good but perhaps a little doughy. The pan fried pork and vegetable dumplings were delicious but they could have been a little more generous with the filling. Overall, service was good. Don't be put off by the Coffee Culture-like decor and the predominance of non Asian clientele-an anomaly on Spadina for sure, but it IS worth a visit."}
{"text":"VIBE  I don't really eat in Chinatown. Why? Rats. My biggest fear. I don't dig the rats (not that there's people out there saying, \"WHOA. I love me some rats with my Chinese food.\" Or rapping  \"Rats Rats Rats Raa Raaa Raaattss!\"  ( I think this needs to be made into a Portlandia episode Toronto style).   But yeah, call it prejudiced or stereotypical, it's why I mainly avoid eating at these restaurants. And we ALL know that Blog TO exclusive that went out years and years ago. That said, I've been to Swatow and New Ho King and I dig it. Mother's Dumplings is no exception. I thought I was going to find a hole in the wall and it's quite a spacious restaurant now. Nice and clean but totally keeps that Chinatown vibe, where you get to see the people working on the side making the dumplings.   We had a good solid hour here and it was fine -you know, just don't come here if you're in a rush. My server learned it was my first time here and she told me all of her favourites with much fervor. It was so nice!   A perfect Saturday lunch!    WE ATE  The food was really, really great!  We got 10 bok choy, mushroom and tofu dumplings. They did not taste like vegetarian dumplings at all. (Note:next time beef and chive!). Love all of that flavour. We also had the wonton soup - the parsely really brought out the flavour and the wonton gave us that protein factor. My friend, Vicki, couldn't stop eating it. She loves it that much!  The potato pancake has chive in it too and it's worth the $3.50!  You also get complimentary tea along with your meal.   All of this for two people (and we were quite stuffed) came up to $20. Are you kidding me?!  Geez.  Now this is on my top cheap eats in Toronto. I walk around this area a lot and it's funny the places you don't notice and what's behind the closed doors. Right? Right!    OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I keep on calling this place \"Mother\" Dumplings. And this places gots dumps like a truck truck -- oh come on, you know you want to sing the Thong Song too. Did I just date myself?"}
{"text":"VIBE  So these guys just opened a week and a half ago, so I'm not going to be too harsh. But on a Friday night at around 7pm, these guys got SLAMMED. And they HUSTLED (and to the obnoxious group who sat before the table was even cleaned, have some manners). It's not the fanciest place but I like the set up - there's some booths that they don't have at the Spadina location and yes, I don't have to go on the TTC for a half hour for my dumpling fix anymore (could be dangerous though!)   I'd try to go on a weekday when it's not going to be as busy. The staff was hustling hard so be kind!   And let's remember: there's a Mother's Dumplings on the Danforth!! Squee.   I ATE Pork and green onion dumplings. Yum.  Beef buns (E1 or 11). Okay. Really doughy. I know it's the thing with the buns - but for $4 they're quite hefty. Not a lot of meat in them though. I wouldn't order it again.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Sometimes you need cheap and cheerful (though I don't know the hierarchy of pricing in dumpling joints in Toronto. There's just some things I'm really not going to excel at in life)."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for dumplings look no further! I prefer the steamed dumplings yet all are simply delicious! The service is not the best yet the food is so good the slow service is easily overlooked."}
{"text":"Worst dumplings I have ever had... Im sorry but I hope they can improve. we ordered 8 dishes but none of them were good. The dumpling skin was way too thick and fillings were flavourless. The beef roll was the worst. Horrible food and long wait ...  Good customer service tho."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. The food was mediocre and the staff was super rude and disorganized. There were at least 10 open tables and we had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. Food came quickly but was nothing special. Relatively cheap, and quick but there are definitely better places to eat in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have  tried most of the dumpling places in NYC and no I won't rate them. In fact the dumplings in NYC I call poop dumplings because they smell like poop. These don't smell like poop! And they taste good! Why can't we have good dumplings in any of the China towns in NYC? We had a mix of menu items such as the mixed grain congee and dumplings of course  and also had sweet dumplings. These dumplings are so good they are almost as good as my husband's not quiet but almost! If it was in NYC it would get 5 stars but since it is not it gets 4. The reason is we don't have any Chinese restaurants as good as Toronto's. It would be outstanding for NYC. For Toronto it is good."}
{"text":"Green chive ones were the best. However the dumplings are highly overpriced as compared to anything you can get uptown. Also the frozen ones are really expensive."}
{"text":"We came here because Dumpling House further down the street was wayy too packed. The dumplings, while good, were on the smaller side. There is a large variety of dumplings that can be had which is definitely a plus. I quite liked the egg and shrimp dumplings we ordered and the green onion pancake was better than Dumpling House. One of my gripes was that although the menu was extensive, it was full of \"safe\" options, meaning things like tripe and century egg were not to be found but there was plenty of General Tao's. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just personal preference, it may even be good for customers who are not into the more \"riske\" dishes. Picky eaters who do not like scary looking foreign food will like this place.  The space was big and well lit. However, there were only 2 servers and they both took their lunch at the same time, so it took us a really long time to grab our dessert and get out of there. By the end of it we just wanted to go. We ended up flagging a bus boy.  The price was above average for dumpling restaurants in the area and I really didn't feel like the quality was any better than the other options. I'd recommend this place for people who want a safe, decent option that has plenty of dumpling variety, but if price and value is a major factor for you, I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I picked to eat here based on some yelp reviews. It was good, but I've had better. I had the green onion pancake and the juicy pork dumplings. Decent, but greasy. A good value at least. One other thing, was that my order took a really long time. I was there at least an hour before the juicy dumplings came out. I was by myself, so I tried to pass the time on my ipad, but they wouldn't let me use the wifi password. Lame."}
{"text":"I wonder what happened to their dumplings.. They were so good when I first came here which was five months ago  The skin was super thick this time"}
{"text":"I don't understand the rave reviews about this place. The food is terrible. The dishes were so bland and unpalatable - take it from a Chinese person who knows how it's meant to taste. If people think the food here is great, they should really try other Chinese places for much better Chinese food."}
{"text":"Came here a few times.   First time it was decent, dumplings tasted good service was okay and I was pretty pleased.   One other time I came here by myself at around dinner time and they basically treated me like an invisible person, took forever to give me tea or to give me an order sheet. And then after I ordered they didn't bring my dumplings for 40 minutes until I asked. Then they brought it promptly but more than half the dumplings were broken and tasteless.   I guess they're okay but the risk for the crappy service and the inconsistent dumplings kinda makes me not want to come back.  also, if you order anything other than dumplings it turns out to be pretty expensive. I got the lamb siu mai which was $8.99 for 6? and they weren't anything special, they tasted better after I drowned then in vinegar :(  came to try a few more times to try to enjoy it more since the reviews are so high but I didn't enjoy it...probably won't come back anymore"}
{"text":"Service is slow.... But hey after the reviews I knew what I was in for  1) tea is cold!!! Not happy but liveable 2) green onion pancake took about 20 minutes and the flavor is there if my mouth wasn't so full of flour it might taste better. it's dry and powdery.... Not impressed.  Positive side is that my tea is cold so I can really wash the dryness down and its not oily.   3). #15 took 4 minutes after green pancake so not too bad.  Server asked me how the food was so attentive.  Taste..very hot very fresh.  I'm impressed.  Skin is very good...ah shoot I just ruined it by eating a green pancake :p   Two dishes 1 person I'm pretty full total damage 12.07 and approx 40 min meal.  Not bad!!! A little high for Chinatown but still good."}
{"text":"Just tried these yummy fresh dumplings - lots of flavour, not greasy. The little shop is impeccably clean and staff was very nice.  We had the steamed juicy pork buns and the fried pork and green onion dumplings. Two of us were full and the total bill was $14.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food was good, yet the service at the Danforth location was painfully slow on a Sunday. Either they are still trying to figure out how to run a new location, or short staffed, but it was not timely service."}
{"text":"I went to try this place out after seeing all the amazing reviews. What did I come out with? Disappointment. There were three of us who were ordering food which included a couple rounds of dumplings and there was nothing we had that was better than ok. With all these great reviews in site they have some great food, but I didn't get any of that. I have my existing favorites in Chinatown and I'll be sticking with them. I won't be back."}
{"text":"One bite into a pork and dill dumpling was all it took before I was hooked on Mother's Dumplings several years ago. I would dream about the fresh, chewy dough and the flavourful, juicy fillings between each weekly visit.   The restaurant's interior is so bad it's good. The completely mismatched (in material, height, and colour) tables are crammed together in the crowded front room and along the wall across a barrier that hides the busy chefs at work. Collaged customer comments that range from sincere to bizarre are framed and displayed along the walls. Against the wall of the entrance, stacks of fantasy novels beg to be swapped for or just taken into a good home. The television sets perched overhead in each room are set to a perpetual screen saver of wild plants and flowers. I most recently also discovered a web cam sitting atop a dividing wall in the very back. Very curious.  The food is delicious and cheap. Besides the obvious dumplings, the menu also includes other not traditionally Chinese dishes such as kimchi and seaweed salad. It wasn't until my most recent visit that I finally got to venture off the beaten dumpling path though. On top of three orders of different dumplings, the noodle soup (unfortunately not freshly handmade as usual since they had run out), tofu salad, raw garlic-heavy sweet and sour slaw, fried puffy filled pancakes, and especially the eye-pleasing assorted sweet steamed buns made a way-too-filling, yet well-rounded meal for four happy bellies.   The service is curt, but it's also a constantly loud, overcrowded, and overwhelmingly steamy work environment. I wonder if things might change in the new, larger space at College and Spadina that's supposed to happen anytime now - the signs say January. I guess we'll find out!"}
{"text":"I always walk past Mother's Dumplings and see a full restaurant - finally went in and tried it myself, and it was great!!   The decor and atmosphere are pretty similar to most restaurants in Chinatown, with one exception - the open concept \"kitchen\" (\"kitchen\" because it was more like a dumpling making area... but kitchen-y enough). It was really nice to be able to see them making the mountains of dumplings.   The service is pretty much what I expected it would be - there aren't a lot of servers, and the place is packed so it can be hard to get their attention. It wasn't a deal breaker though, as we had lots of time.   The dumplings were all delicious - we had the pork and chives, pork chives and shrimp (note: exactly the same as the first but with shrimp), the pork and dill, and a pan fried pork and bok choi dumpling, which was my favorite. We also had the dessert platter - as there were 4 of us, they gave us 8 pieces instead of the 6 listed, which was really nice and let us try them all! The dessert buns were quite good, and also really visually appealing!   I will definitely be back - I would even consider stopping by to get a big platter of dumplings for the office, or to bring to party!   Note: they don't accept credit card payments - debit and cash only!"}
{"text":"I've had my share of dumplings, having grown up in Taiwan, and eaten in the Asianvilles up and down California. I have to say these are definitely THE BEST dumplings I've ever had. They put ingredients in their dumplings that you would not normally get at your typical dumpling joint --- but they taste wonderful. Though some may think that the long wait is a negative, but it's only because they make them only as you order them. The texture and the feel of the outside wrapping makes or breaks a dumpling. The fact that they roll the dough and wrap the ingredients right there is one of the reasons why the dumplings are sooooo tasty. Too bad I'm only in Toronto for a day. But I'd definitely come back to the city just to eat their dumplings again!  Thanks to Yelp for helping me find this hole in the wall. It's hard to spot even when you know the address!"}
{"text":"Really really really good dumplings! Steamed, pan fried, whatever your preference... Pan fried were cooked to perfection.  Not somewhere you take a date to impress but defiantly a spot I would recommend.  Come with friends so you can try more!"}
{"text":"I honnestly like this place a lot! It takes time, it's hand made dumpling. We took the steamed veggie dumpling and steamed shrimp one. The buns were suppringsly good! Very good! My favorite dumpling was the veggie ones. weirdly enough, I just though the texture was better than the shrimp ones. Like every good asian restaurant, there was a good assortment of dipping sauce and even though the service was dry and not very friendly, the dumpling were good. I was passing by the cooks or dumpling master, smiled, and they smiled back. I guess there was some warmt in the service and in was in the open kitchen with the cook. Quite a large place but usually packed.   J'ai adoré mon expérience a cet endroit! Même si ça prend beaucoup plus de temps qu'un dumpling normal, c'est quand même rapide. Le service est un peu froid en revenge, en passant devant les cuisiniers (qui sont dans un cusine à aire ouverte) j'ai souris et reçu un sourire chaleureux qui se reflètais dans les dumplings. J'ai mangé les dumpling à la vapeur végétariens et aux crevettes ainsi que les pains à la vapeur (ceux farcis au porcs et ceux twisted). C'est vraiment délicieux, j'ai à ma surprise, préféré ceux qui était végétarien à ceux aux crevette. Les buns aux porcs était probablement mon truc favoris. L'endroit est assez grand et très bien."}
{"text":"A group of us were craving dumplings one Saturday night and headed to Mother's, which some of us had and others had not been to before.   We ordered green string beans which were saucy, garlicky and good. A mixture of pan fried and steamed dumplings including the soup dumplings, pork and chive, beef and chive, bok choy, beef and green onion.  With the vinegar and soy sauce to dip, we were very satisfied. Such comfort food.   Though an order was missed and we did not receive some food, I would probably give Mother's anther chance, because what I did eat, I loved."}
{"text":"4th time visitng this place and  my 1st time getting bad service. the 3 of us arrived and waited to be seated. at least 4 servers passed us without acknowledging that we were there. eventually we were seated. my friends and i ordered the steames pork and chive, the pan fried shrimp dumplings, shrimp fried rice and the mafo tofu. they all tasted very good and authentic. the pan fried dumplings could have been more crunchy. the shrimp fried rice tasted better than it looked. when they first brought the rice out we were disappointed to say the least...no visual appeal what so ever. the tofu on the other hand looked and tasted so savoury. it came with a meat sauce. i normally don't enjoy soft tofu but this was done to perfection"}
{"text":"Fresh tasty dumplings, excellent side dishes and great service. This is a great place for a lunch or dinner and the location is great too (just south of College on Spadina). It is a busy place, but if you want to beat crowds, try going before 6pm. Its a great restaurant for sharing different dishes and the prices are very reasonable, I will definitely be going back here. My only complaint is that the restaurant does not have air conditioning, so avoid this place on a very hot day..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mother's Dumpling!  They have some great options for vegetarians and prices are good!"}
{"text":"It's taken a long time to get this image out of my mind whenever someone mentions dumplings in Toronto:    http://www.blogto.com/eat_drink/2008/02/rats_feast_at_dumpling_house/  It's been a couple of years now so I'm almost over it.  We checked out Mother's Dumplings (not the place where the rats were) for brunch on a Sunday.  I was impressed at how big the restaurant was.  We were given a table at the very back where the area was lit by a skylight.  We placed our order - steamed ($5.50), pan fried ($5.95) and boiled ($6.25) pork dumplings, juicy pork ($6.10), green onion pancake ($3.55) and garlic baby bak choi ($8.99).  Two orders of dumplings and the pancake arrived first.  We were off to a good start but then there was a huge wait (about 30 min) for the next couple of items.    The garlic baby bak choi arrived cold after being delivered to the wrong table. They tasted quite bland and I think it was more boiled than stir fried.  Then another long wait for the next order of dumplings.  The juicy pork dumplings were the very last to arrive.  At least they were hot.  After this huge wait, we should have known better than to order dumplings to go but I did anyway.  Another long wait for two orders of dumplings and the bill.    We had now been in the restaurant for 2.5 hrs which is beyond me.  The beauty of Asian food is that it's generally done fast and eaten furiously.   Dumplings were good, especially the fried ones.  The slow service completely deters me from coming back.  Definitely not for the impatient (like me).  Thank god for my good brunch companions."}
{"text":"I was thisclose to giving this restaurant five stars, which doesn't happen often in my book. Is it because I now call North Carolina my home, where the dearth of authentic Chinese (let's not even talk about dim sum) restaurants makes me cry weekly? Probably. But compared to any standard, the dumplings here are delicious, not to mention cheap. We returned twice within a span of three days on a recent trip to Toronto. Four point five stars, easy. I loved the taste of the xiao long bao and both types of veggie dumplings my husband and I tried (both steamed and fried). The shrimp and/or meat dumplings, veggie and/or pork bao, and chive/egg dumplings are also really good, although truth be told we have probably had slightly better elsewhere.  Advice: don't dine here on a time constraint - service is remarkably slow. We ordered 3 dishes and just edged in ahead of the lunch crowd, but it still took nearly an hour and a half to finish eating since the orders came out one at a time, after a long delay. However, for the made-to-order freshness and price, Mother's Dumplings just can't be beat. P.S. When we were there, there were tons of other Asians dining in the resto, contrary to what some other Yelpers have noted."}
{"text":"Went there for a dinner on a weeknight and loved the dumplings!   We ordered: Steamed dumplings B2 (melon, tofu, vegetable noodle) and B9 (juicy pork bun).  Both were delicious and I somehow managed not to burn myself with the juicy pork ones, so that's a plus.  Steamed buns E3 (vegetarian) were good too, not as amazing as the dumplings, but the filling was really tasty.   Side dish of I8 (large assorted salad) came with 4 different salads (peanuts, dried noodles, bean sprouts, and cabbage strings).  This was decent and i enjoyed the variety, but it could have been better."}
{"text":"If you are looking for \"non-greasy spoon\" Chinese in China Town then this is definitely it.  With fresh dumplings handmade to order this is what I have been missing in Toronto."}
{"text":"OM NOM NOM NOM NOM!!!! I went through those dumplings like a John Deere cutting grass. Simply delicious. Best Chinese dumplings I ever had. Love the doughy texture of the wrapping. It was different but in a good way. The stuffing for the pork and chive dumplings was spot on and the beef inside the beef steam bun was just great. The only thing that left me hanging was the green onion pancake. It was the weakest dish of the bunch just because it just tasted too plain.  When coming here make sure you don't order rice. I ordered a bowl just because us Filipinos will order rice, if rice is on the menu. Big mistake. The dough from the dumplings have enough carbs and gluts already, and by ordering rice, your just going over board. The restaurant itself is nice but I can understand why so many people dislike the feeling of the joint. It feels like the place is using all its space poorly. I would have loved to see the old place.   P.S. There are non-Asians cooking in an Asian restaurant!!! First time I have ever seen such a spectacle. Strange but it just proves the recipes are so top notch that the owners were sure anybody from any background couldn't screw them up."}
{"text":"Abysmal food, apathetic service, and chaotic atmosphere.   Shrimp and vegetable with rice noodle was foul and immeasurably salty. The fewer than 10 shrimp were smaller than my thumb nail.   Spring onion pancake was tough in texture, lacked flavour, and proved inedible."}
{"text":"A once stellar spot for a Chinatown feeding frenzy, Mother's seems to have succumbed to the law of large numbers.   I write this review as the 168th entrant into the pool; a few years after mothers relocated to larger digs on the main Spadina trip. my first visit occurred shortly after the new storefront opened; but not too shortly, since it took several tries to get in, without long dinner lineups depleting the precious dumpling supply. Once I finally did arrive, I was well pleased; walls decorated with framed customer testimonials (hilarious ones at that), an open kitchen where little old ladies stuffed dough with all manner of fillings, and what could only be described as a rec room at the rear; leathette couches, a home depot water fixture and semi-ignored pool table, which made me wonder how one could eat a plate of dumplings in repose.   My first few dinners marked the beginning of a new relationship phase; the one where it's perfectly acceptable to just hang out, and eat gloriously messy food before heading home, together. Those were exciting days, and the dumplings themselves were a perfect blend of homey comfort and explosive carnal lust. Juicy pork and chive, erupting with broth; delicate boiled skins nuzzled against each other, slicked with soy sauce, chili oil, or tarted up with vinegar. The boiled chicken version a cloudy exercise in texture more than flavor; the shrimp-chive-and-egg slightly pongy, but filled with good quality minced shrimp; an obscenely good scallion pancake that Pillsbury would do well to knock off. Wonton soup with salty broth and disconcertingly chewy dried shrimp. Two or three dishes made little impact on my wallet, but registered huge in my belly.    In time, the lines died down, and the passion drained from that particular relationship. Attempts to recreate either sadly failed; some dining partners just preferred to see what they were eating; some opted to turn their steamed beef bun (pleasantly chewy inside, although the bun itself was a tad dense) into a half-eaten meat-puppet at the table, thereby ending any chance at another date. The dumplings themselves turned into boring, indifferently-filled, overly doughy affairs.  Prices have steadily escalated. A bowl of pho down the street is a better deal.   The tea was still free. The service still distracted enough to require multiple repetitions of one's order, despite the nifty dim-sum-checklist format. But it wasn't the same. Maybe I'll go back for nostalgia's sake at some point; the same way an ex-lover's arms can bring comfort until the next lover comes along...(although I'm married now, so that ain't gonna happen), but for me, Mother's Dumplings stands as a cautionary tale. It may be hugely successful, but success has come at the price of special."}
{"text":"Don't do it. If you have an appetite for Chinese food you would be better off picking up a box from the frozen food case at the grocery market and bringing it home to microwave. This was one of the worst examples of Tourist Food garbage that I have ever experienced. Really bad, not even close to good,  authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"I visited this place with a friend, ordered steamed and fried dumplings, and they did not fail to please. They were not the best I ever had, but definitely a very good meal. did not disappoint. I liked the service, the atmosphere and washrooms were clean. I have been back a second time, and everything was consistent."}
{"text":"Whoohoo, another hit on my list!  Went to Mother's Dumplings today for dinner with 2 of my buddies. The new location is definitely a big step up from what is described in some of the older reviews. The place is BIG with lots of tables at the front and another room at the back. Decor must be a big improvement, because all the furniture and place settings matched.  I liked that all the tables were spread far apart from one another, no chance of bumping chairs with the next table.  We ordered 2 salads (seaweed salad and the smashed cucumber salad) plus 3 orders of dumplings:  Pork and bak choi (boiled) - simple but really tasty  Shrimp & egg (steamed) - these were my fav!   Beef & chives (steamed) - nicely seasoned beef!  I was impressed with the complexity of each filling - there was a good mix of flavours, colours and textures packed into each one. Really homemade looking.  The service was really good too. Tea was brought immediately, and 3 big glasses of water upon our request. Food took about 10 mins. Bill was brought promptly and she made change for us with no complaints.  The bill came to $27, so about a tenner each."}
{"text":"Handmade dumplings and stuffed steamed buns. Hand made noodles. All made in house! The kitchen is wide open, behind a glass wall where you see the cooks preparing the noodles and dumplings.   The food doesn't come out as fast as normal, or most typical Chinese restaurants do, but the food is well worth the wait. Especially since you know everything was hand made. No frozen or pre packaged food here.Everything's fresh and tasty!  I suggest the Da Lu soup. Great hearty bowl of hand made noodles, dropped egg, pork, and black mushrooms. The dumplings come in servings of 10 or 20 if you get them steamed, 12 or 24 if you get them boiled. Get them steamed. Their bigger and tastier, but either way both types are good. They also have them pan fried.   Favorite dish here though are the steamed buns. Something magical about these buns. Sooo tasty. For a full review, check out my site:"}
{"text":"Almost 3.9.  Pork with dill and egg with chive dumplings are good tasty ones, but you have to eat like 10 or 20 of the same kind. Staff is OK. Place is OK, not clean, not dirty and no A/C. Forget about the smoothies (made with powder only, not with fresh fruits).  OK to go back, but not in a hurry to."}
{"text":"Came here for dumplings & was not impressed. It was average, idk what everyone is raving about. The dumplings didnt have much flavors by themselves but have to dip in a sayce of up choice,  the basics. It was OK. Soup dumplings weren't very soupy & average. Kinda disappointed going here"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times.  I have also been the ever famous Din Tai Fung dumpling house in Arcadia, CA.  I've only been to the Arcadia one once, but thought it was the perfect dumpling.  Fillings were great and the steamed rice shells were of perfect consistency.  I wish I can go back and compare it some more with Mother's Dumplings.  Maybe during my next California visit back home...  Anyway, not everything at Mother's Dumplings is amazing.  I definitely recommend the steamed pork and chives and steamed vegetarian dumplings.  Yum yum.  The pork has a little bit of fat so the dumplings are a little bit juicy on the inside.  And, I love chives so it can't get any better.  The vegetarian dumplings have vermicelli, tofu, and mushrooms inside and it has that mushroom flavor.  Very delish.  I ordered my dumplings with the dried seaweed and dried soup, which was only $1.50!  I thought it was a great accommodation to the dumplings.  However, I have had the tomato soup (5.99) and thought it was extremely tasty.    Others I have ordered and do not recommend: Steamed beef and chives - not as flavorful as the  Steamed shrimp - it was not what I was expecting. Pork buns - I definitely would not recommend this at all.  I would go elsewhere. Pancakes - good.  I would order again but I would rather save room in my tummy for more dumplings."}
{"text":"Fast services, great friendly stuff. Dumplings are fresh and filling. For sure will come back"}
{"text":"Mother's Dumplings has tasty dumplings that decently priced.  They have other food too.  It's a popular young person hang out spot.  I was surprised to see the non-Chinese wait staff.  You don't really see that in places in Chinatown, actually in any Chinatown around the world.  I like Dumpling House better than Mother's though.  Mother's is a trendy type of place."}
{"text":"Do you have a noodle or dumpling fetish?  Now you do.  You can watch them handmake the dumplings.  But for me it's all about the noodles, which are also fresh, and the sweet chinese vinegar and chili sauce to compliment them.   I dream of these noodles.  I can't say anymore about them.  You can watch the video of me enjoying them instead:  I  love Mother's Dumplings: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyOhx1Y-FYA"}
{"text":"I still love Mother's Dumplings but ever since they moved to the larger location a few years ago I feel that sometimes their quality can be a bit hit-or-miss, especially as prices have risen.   The dumplings are still delicious and nothing beats some delicious hot dumplings on a cold Canadian winter day, but something about the old location being a hole in a wall just added to the authentic experience."}
{"text":"Been here several times before and enjoyed the food and experience.  Just left the restaurant after waiting a hour for food.  They brought the wrong dish which made me wonder if they had my initial order.  While questioning them it was obvious the kitchen and staff had no idea what they were doing.  Another customer spoke up saying he too waited an hour in a empty restaurant. When i sat back down the people next to me also chimed in to say they too were served only one dish and have been waiting an hour for the other dishes. The manager told me the printer was broken which is why there is a delay in orders.  He told me it would be another 15 mins before i get my food.  He wasn't apologetic and didn't seem to care. The waitress was the same.  Not impressed"}
{"text":"I came here because of the hype on their xiao long bao and I should've listened to all the bad reviews. They were so right.  I did sit in the back with the umbrellas so that was a nice suggestion from a fellow Yelper. I had their pork xiao long bao (B9) and their steamed beef and chives dumplings (B5).   Not a wizard at xiao long bao but you've got standards for food you really enjoy. The beef and chives weren't good in the slighest. The pork was okay but it's too hyped up.  Overrated and I won't be coming back. But service was good."}
{"text":"Me and a friend recently visited Toronto and stayed at the Planet Traveller nearby. My friends know me for my love of Dim Sum so when I heard about Mother's Dumplings I really wanted to check it out. After an exhausting day of sightseeing we were greeted and seated quickly and cheerfully. The restaurant is warm and inviting and the clientele, at least on the night we visited, were plentiful. The menus handily illustrate the foods for those who don't know dim sum very well and the prices were excellent. The two of us had a very full and satisfying meal for just over CA$44. The highlight has to be the fact you can see the dumplings being made through a glass window and really makes you appreciate the quality of the food even more. I would heartily recommend to any traveller or local! Make sure you order the pan friend pork and bak choi dumplings and the fried beans!"}
{"text":"The boiled dumplings were pretty basic.  The wrapper was a bit thicken than my liking so i felt like i was eating dough balls with some meat inside.  We also ordered the shanghai xiao long baos and it was a disappointment.  The XLB had no juice inside at all and the flavours were nothing but meaty taste.  the chive and pork dumplings were too salty compared to the other dishes as well.  The dishes were not that cheap either.  I'm not sure if i would recommend to others."}
{"text":"This place was big and service was fast. Dumplings don't taste as good and it was quite bland.  Everything felt like a rush."}
{"text":"Dumplings are my go-to food when I need be coddled by my mother who, even though she  lives a relatively shortish driving distance in Richmond Hill, is always too busy  at her Madmen-themed cocktail parties in her retirement community to fry up a pierogi cluster for me when I am sad and lonely. You notice how every culture has some sort of dumpling? My Polish mama has pierogis and your Italian mama has gnocchi and whoever is the proprietor of this restaurant has a Chinese mother who makes dumplings and we are all together.  It's hard when you are sad and lonely to go to a Chinese dumpling restaurant because they come in sets of 12 and if you want a variety, you have to order some to go. SIGH.  I decided on the noodle bowl and chose the seafood with rice noodles. I am a low taster, having discovered that in Grade 10 high school biology class licking on some litmus paper, I have like, no tastebuds whatsoever. Which means food is all about texture and spice that will make you feel alive until the next day.  The noodle bowl arrived (and by the way, awesome lunch time service) and looked fresh and photogenic (sorry, I only use my phone for real porn). Remember I said I ordered the seafood bowl? Well there were several chunks of fried tofu on top. I know, right? By the way, I read an article about how tofu isn't all that and basically soy is garbage unless it is fermented and so if you eat tofu, you might as well eat Velveeta chunks...maybe I'm making that up, but true story about soy products being over-rated. I twirled my spoon around and found some seafood alright, but it was't chunks of fish and shrimps and delightful scallops but it was those tiny little marine weirdlings that are shaped like minuscule octopus and teeny weeny vaginas (clams?) that come in a bag that are in the frozen section that you wonder who buys this? Well I had that for lunch today.  Also being a low taster, there was not a lot of flavour to the broth. I was unexpectantly amused by the texture of the tofu because let us not kid ourselves, tofu is gross. I was disappointed by the Lilliputian micro-sea nuggets, BUT! I was happy with the rice noodles and the fresh greenery, because who isn't missing vegetable nutrients? But I think in the end, it was all boiled with just water, even after adding soy sauce and hot sauce, there was that something missing like maybe that awesome fish sauce that is actually pure anchovy juice that smells excitingly funky like the ladies locker room after a spin class. I think my mother would have liked this soup though, she likes things bland, being Polish and all. I have faith, though, that other things on the menu will be better and I will come back. Maybe it's me, my lack of taste buds and my loneliness. Maybe I don't need a boyfriend, maybe I need a girlfriend? Huh.  I took home some dumplings, the steamed shrimp ones, but they never made it home, I sucked them back one by one in the car in less than a minute after I pulled over at the liquor store on Danforth and Greenwood. Then I got some vodka."}
{"text":"Very busy, loud but pleasant place.  I came one hour prior to closing and it was still really crowded. The servers were super busy and couldn't lead me to my seat until I asked, but they were all nice and helpful. After that they set up my seat right away with clean dishes and nice tea.  I ordered boiled shrimp, pork, egg&chive dumplings and a medium sized hot&sour soup. The soup literally came out in a minute or two and smelt nice-compared to other restaurants the funny scent was weaker. It was also less sour and more spicy, but not too much. The dumplings took a while but they were really nice and hot. Although they were a little overwhelming for me, I finished the whole plate.   Good food, okay service. Would definitely visit again later."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Best homemade dumplings in Downtown, Toronto . . . and now with a newer, larger and kitschy-er venue!  Cost: -$10-20/head (tax and tip included)  Atmosphere/Decor: -It went from a hole-in-the-wall basement gem to a much larger unit with crimson red walls and kitschy romanticized paintings of the orient.  So bad it's good.  Best part: their framed fan notes thankfully made the transition too!  Ordered: 1. Steamed juicy pork bun: Best item on the menu, though not the best 'siu leung bao' I've had.  Still, delicious and a must-order.  I'm generally a fan of most of their steamed dumpling offerings.  2. Pan fried pork and bak choi dumpling: Skin thickness just right, with the right amount of char for extra taste.  3. Boiled dumplings (any): I know they're boiled, but I found them too soggy, the skin too thick, and the taste a bit bland. Could be just a personal preference though.  4. Beef onion roll: Best non-dumpling item on the menu, but a bit too salty (just wipe some of the sauce off).  Would recommend sharing because it's a pretty large portion for one person.  5. Green onion pancake: Not so good.  Too doughy and bland.  6. Pork and vegetable steamed buns: Not so good.  Even though they were supposedly freshly made, the bun was stale and chewy instead of fresh and fluffy.  Service: -Bare bones and functional.  No complaints. -Can get very busy and food can take a while to come, but you know it's freshly made!  Conclusion: -Delicious and affordable homemade style dumplings that's best shared with a group of friends.  Good to see these guys are still retaining the quality of their food since expanding to a larger and more convenient location."}
{"text":"Visiting from Philadelphia PA. First time at Mothers Dumplings! Great place! Ordered pork juicy buns, steamed pork & dill dumplings, pan fried pork dumplings, scallion pancakes, scallion & egg pancake and steamed twisted dough (note: I was with 3 others). All excellent, love it here! ... And Toronto too!"}
{"text":"Was skeptical at first but decided to check this place out. Loved watching the dumplings being hand made. I HIGHLY recommend the spring rolls for appetizer. Best spring rolls I ever had. And the steamed vegetable dumplings were AMAZING. We got 10 for 2 people and we're still hungry so you should just order 20."}
{"text":"So you're cruisin' Chinatown looking to rock some dumps - chances are you're going to end up at Mother's Dumplings (or start there if you know what's up). This place is a got-dang institution and with good reason - it's got great dumplings. You don't have to take my word for it, look at how busy this place gets most nights!  For starters, do yourself a favour and get the fried green beans with ground meat on them. Salty and addictive, the fact that they're green might even trick you into thinking you're eating something healthy! As for the main event - the dumplings aka dumps - I always like to get an order of boiled and an order of fried. The crispness of the outside of a fried dumpling is a nice contrast from the soft, pillowy boiled sibling. You can also get steamed dumplings, if that's your thing.   Service here, even when busy, is typically fast. There are little call buttons on the tables so you can ensure someone will be by to pick up your order or bring your cheque in moments.  If you're in need of salty comfort food, Mother's Dumplings will always scratch that itch."}
{"text":"The soup dumplings were delicious. And the pork and chive dumplings too. The shrimp fried rice was ok. Stick to the dumplings."}
{"text":"So delicious! I've been here multiple times and every time the food has been wonderful. The pork and chive dumplings have been my  go to, as well as the juicy pork bun which is heaven in a tiny bun. Service has always been good and reliable. So good!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill, probably due to their growth and popularity. I have been coming to this place since 2005, when I was still in university and this place was a hole in the wall on Huron st.   I've probably visited this restaurant over 50 times since then, and told every one I knew about this place through word of mouth for years, and after my last outing there, I have decided to never go back again.  The prices used to be great, even as their dumplings went from $7/8 up to the $10+ today! I stuck it out. During that same period, the quality of the dumplings went down, particularly on craftsmanship, nowadays the dumplings often come out watery and not well enclosed, leaking juice and flavour, which wasn't the case before. I still stuck it out and continued to take my parents and friends here. The service level had declined in recent years as well, and I didn't care, because I can see how busy they are all the time, so I still stuck it out.  the final straw was this past Friday, I walked in for 6 people, and was told to wait 30-40min (and it was hard grabbing the guy's attention). After 20min, I wanted to get an update, and the waiter told me he doesn't know how much longer and refused to give me an estimate, I could tell he was agitated that I wanted an update, and basically told me if I can't wait, then maybe I should just leave.  I have been loyal to this place for years, and I realized I've just been holding on to the good old days. I've crossed the threshold now, this place is no longer worth the wait, bad service, rising prices, and worsening quality."}
{"text":"I must have read up about this place months ago because as I entered the resto, I was dishing out factoids to my friend about the menu, the owners, the floors, etc. Anyways, get in and order the lamb shiu ma, pork and something, bla bla bla. Also got an order of wonton soup  The soup was horrible and tasted like sea weed, i didnt order the sea weed soup, i want the wontons. wtf? anyways note to self dont order the wonton soup  got the dumplings, they were pretty good, nothing to write home about, lamb shiu ma was pretty awesome, steamed pork pretty dope, fried pork pretty dope.   I also got the bun, i thought this was AWESOME, it was huge, and you can dunk every single solitary side of dough and meat with soy and hot chili oil (NECTAR!!!). My friend wasnt a fan, I guess I paid for my love this morning either way.   Reccomended: if you want some dumplings, but dont want to splurge on a baller dim sum place.  Not reccomended: if you plan to do sports after, have intercourse, or do anything involving physical activity.  Does it live up to they hype? No, clearly a bunch of pot heads wrote the reviews because this place is just A-OK!  Next up? : im going to a balla dim sum place to eat dumplings, like a BOSS!"}
{"text":"I'm still in awe of how cheap these fresh, homemade dumplings are. My favorite were the shrimp, chive and egg steamed dumplings. The veggie noodle and pork were good as well, although the boiled variety seem to fall apart a little more easily (the fact that they were hot so I was trying to eat them in 2 bites probably didn't help). We also had a green onion pancake which was very good. Mmmmmm dumplings."}
{"text":"I read so much about Mother's Dumplings on Yelp! I have yet have any dumplings in Chinatown as there are tons up at Scarborough/Richmond Hill area. Both me and my friend were pleasantly surprise how good the food they served here!!  The deco here is nice! Way too nice for a Chinese restaurant..  dare I say it is decorated more for the non Chinese crowds..... Even the washroom here is nice and clean... Am I in Chinatown???  Beef Noodle is great!! The soup base has this great aroma of beef and hmmm and nicely flavoured!! The noodle was chewy with a lot of bite but cooked perfectly without the taste of flour...   Boiled Vegetable and Pork dumplings!! The skin was so thin... not doughy at all!! I just kept popping them in my mouth and my friend just couldn't keep up with me and I ended up ate 2/3 of the order!! and I can still have more!! They are that good!!   Services here is fast and efficient... typical Chinese restaurants services...   Now I want to try their steamed dumplings and hopefully that will be real soon!"}
{"text":"Solid if unspectacular. We had the pan-fried beef and celery and steamed pork and chive, plus a scallion pancake. The pancake was too thick and fairly bland, but the dumplings were very good. The dough was thick but well-cooked, and the flavours of the filling were delicate and vegetal. I enjoyed watching the dumplings being made by hand."}
{"text":"Awesome dim sum! These were the best homemade dumplings I've ever had! They make the dumplings right in front of you at the counter. You have a few choices of dumplings, beef, pork, vegetable, or scallions. I prefer the shanghai dumplings. The prices are pretty reasonable too! $8 for 12 dumplings or $13 for 24. They also served a complimentary pot of green tea! If you're in Chinatown you need to stop by and try them!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh dumplings--the perfect brunch meal.  I like to start with soup, each person ordering a plate of dumplings and then adding to the meal slowly.  By the time a few hours of tea have been downed and your tummy is filled, the sluggishness of the hangover is replaced with the somewhat more manageable sluggishness of dumpling dough in your stomach.  Mother's has more space than Dumpling House across the street and roughly the same quality of food (although I do prefer DH's fried dumplings).  They have some good soups, their beef roll is good, the green onion cake is good as others have mentioned.  I love both steamed and fried choices, and the soup inside some of the dumpling selections is pretty delicious.  I didn't find the place overpriced as other reviewers have.  The service is indifferent but sort of standard for Chinatown--you have to hail servers over but in the times that I've been there I've experienced no major mistakes.  All in all, it's a cheap, satisfying meal, and  I think I'm addicted to the dipping vinegar."}
{"text":"So disappointing!!!!! The shrimp dumplings were so strange and I cannot stand that taste......."}
{"text":"Mother's Dumplings, as a Haiku   Dumplings sublime here, Fast, good service and cheap too. Spadina's best soup"}
{"text":"I come here because my friend said this is the best dumpling place in town. I am Asian and really in to Chinese food. This dumpling place is so so. It will have a good review from white people because the place looks nice compare to other dumpling place and they also make a fresh dumpling. I order pork and chive dumpling which has not much taste. Fried rice was just a standard. Lots of meat but no taste at all. I might comeback again if my friends come. But of I have to think about good dumpling in toronto, this would be other place . Not here . Yummy yummy is way better but bad decoration."}
{"text":"Dumplings are a great way to get a group of people together to enjoy some yummers. Due to dietary restrictions I can't eat pork which narrowed my choices quite a bit. I went on a weekday lunch and the place was quite packed, but we didn't have to wait long.  Mini-sheets were provided to place orders and service was prompt.  We were seated next to the station where dumplings were prepped.  I was genuinely impressed in the labor required and was assured of the fresh quality.  I want to state that if you're not gaga over dumplings, like myself, then I suggest you get the fried ones, though there is an exception to this rule. Steamed lamb shui mai was by far my favourite! Even though it was steamed, I absolutely loved it.  I recommend this to all, because it pleased everyone. We asked them to make us mushroom and chicken fried dumplings but the combo was slimy! Beef and celery fried dumplings was a good combo but might be a hit or miss for certain people. If you want to take a break from the dumplings, try the green onion pancake.  It's simple, but so tasty. It was a cheap meal.  We paid $11/each person including tip amongst 4 of us AND we were all stuffed."}
{"text":"I could talk about the dumplings and all the money I spent here but I think I'll make it simple. Head south and cross the street to the west side of Spadina and head to dumpling king. Tried most of the meat and veggie ones here and they didn't taste that great. Service was sub par."}
{"text":"No offense to my real mom, but I think I want to be adopted by Mother's Dumplings...especially if she will feed me the deliciousness I had last night.  I picked up an embarrassing amount of food - the server scratched out one of my items because she thought I had made a mistake by including it.  I quietly and shamefully told her, \"no, I also want that.\"  Awkward.  Anyways, had a lot of time to survey the restaurant because the food took FOREVER (small price to pay for freshness, but if you're in a rush, may want to call ahead and place your order).  Place was nice and the seating was spaced out nicely, so you weren't on someone else's date with them.  Can't speak to service, other than the person who cashed me out was efficient and to the point.  The food was excellent.  Dumplings were juicy without spewing out massive amounts of sauce when bitten into.  Boiled dumplings weren't soggy, steamed dumplings weren't obnoxiously dry.  Flavour was fresh and there was no weird aftertaste.  It was a great meal to satisfy a dumpling craving.  Prices were decent as well.  Is the food worth changing my name to Candi Dumplings?  Probably not, so maybe adoption is a bit extreme.  But I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Service was great, as was the food.  We had Shrimp, egg & chives,  Chives and eggs filled pancakes and Chicken and mushroom.  Yummy"}
{"text":"Noodle and dumpling were just perfect! I want to visit again."}
{"text":"Place was clean. Service was good. Dumpling was not tasty. I've had better dollar dumplings in NYC. The skin of the dumplings just didn't have the right mouth feel. The boiled ones felt a little too thick, doughy, possibly undercooked. The steamed ones were rubbery and disappointing. The filling inside the dumplings were small and minimally flavorful."}
{"text":"This place really deserves better ratings than it currently has.   It's located just down the street from the University of Toronto. It's usually fairly crowded but the wait is worth it - the dumplings taste great."}
{"text":"Tiny hole-in-the-wall-esque dumpling eatery in Chinatown. The decor and service are frankly, not good, but you're coming here because you love dumplings in monstro proportions. Though they didn't have a few things we would have wanted off the menu, what we got, we liked. The dumplings are freshly made, meaning you'll have a wait a while; don't show up hungry.  Obligatory Title Pun: MOTHER of all dumpling houses.  Menu Readability: I lower my menu standards slightly for Chinese restaurants. Is this fair? I don't know. But it did take us a while to figure out what and how to order.  Need to mention: They also offer frozen dumplings for take out.  What this place teaches me about myself: Quality of dumplings notwithstanding -- service counts. It cost this place a whole point."}
{"text":"Bless you, Mother's Dumplings for all your consistent dumpling love. I've been visiting you for years and I don't really feel the need to stray. I have simple needs - your steamed melon and tofu dumplings and your green onion pancake - but you always meet them. And listen, in my life, many foods are just a vehicle for sauce. So thank you for providing a selection of four, which to me taste best all mixed together in the tiny bowl you provide. And thank you for your never ending complimentary tea.   Does it sound like I was hungover the last time I visited this place? Because I was, and I felt much better when I left."}
{"text":"Food and drink: They have a few vegetarian options which I appreciated. My favourite was the steamed mushroom & tofu dumplings. The melons ones were okay but less flavourful. I also enjoyed the green onion pancake (well salted) and the sesame rice balls for dessert (warm and fresh with a good amount of black sesame inside). Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"Don't ever come here on a Saturday night! It's too damn busy.  I'm just glad I was able to get a reservation or else I would have been waiting over an hour to get a table.  First off they forgot to serve the 2nd half of our order.  They kept saying that the kitchen was super busy and falling behind but yet I saw two other tables who got their Chinese broccoli with garlic before I did.  So yea they forgot us.  Food wise it's not bad but the service turned me off after waiting almost an hour for our food.    If you decide to try this place then go on a weekday or a slow time cus the busy times are too crazy!"}
{"text":"What to try?  Of course the dumplings!! Made in house, comes either pan fried, steamed or boiled. If you're new to dumplings, I'd recommend the pan fried option (if diet is not a concern for you too haha). The traditional way is to dip it in the black vinegar sauce but nowadays you can dip it in any sauce you like. If you like hot chili sauce, go for it! It's awesome that they also have the chefs making the dough and wrapping the dumplings right in front of the patrons because you can be rest assured that the dumplings are indeed freshly made at the restaurant. I would have loved if there was more juice in the dumpling when you bite into it, that the juice is gushing out, but I overall liked the dumplings we ordered.   Last tip?   To avoid burning yourself or making a mess with squirting juice everywhere the moment you bite into the dumplings, make sure you take a small bite of the dumpling skin to open a hole and you can suck out the pork juice out from the dumpling first before you take another bite of the dumpling. Takes quite the practice to master this when you want to experience the dumpling the right way!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat.  I have always loved dumplings but since becoming a vegetarian, I haven't had dumplings in a restaurant in decades.  They simply don't serve vegetarian dumplings anywhere.    I ordered two orders of 10, I had to share two of the dumplings with my toddler, otherwise I would have easily finished my entire order.  I love the look of this place, other eateries are either in need of a reno or has the same generic \"modern\" look.  I'm already planning my next trip to this joint and checking out their menu so that I don't waste any time when I'm there."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! So authentic! I had the kimchi fried rice and the beef and pork dumplings! I'm itching to get back to Toronto to go back to this place. Oh and as a treat...eat the fortune cookie! Don't ask why...just do it and thank me later!"}
{"text":"2 and half stars But 3 because service was not bad.     For those that eat dim sum regularly uptown in Scarborough or Markham. This place is considered very pricey.    4.19 for one piece of green onion pancake.   Even Asian legend or ding tai fung is cheaper.   For the same price I can go to several uptown places and get 2 orders for the price of one.   Dumplings were on the pricey side as well.  But The food also took a long time to come out. But given they are new and the place was quite full.  I don't blame them.    Dumplings tasted good. Da Lu noodles not so much. Very bland I thought.   I find in dumpling places hot sauce is very important. They offer a chilli oil (not spicy and no real flavour). And siracha hot sauce as well."}
{"text":"WOW!  Had selected another place from Google, but asked the hotel Concierge where they thought was bet.  They sent us here.  Loved the atmosphere, loved watching the ladies hand make the dumplings, and LOVED the dumplings!  Watched many wonderful smelling items go past us.  We settled on a smaller lunch, with my wife and I splitting a bowl of hot and sour soup (VERY flavorful!), and an order of pork dumplings.    Good entrees on the menu.  I spied the General Tso's, and a couple of noodle items, too."}
{"text":"It can be a challenge to find a place that offers a decent selection for both vegetarians and meat eaters. This place offers a great selection of delicious dumplings to satisfy both kinds of diets! Personally, I found the vegetarian dishes to be a bit more flavorful and interesting than the meat dumplings!   There was also a dumpling making station right next to our table. Those people were like machines! They were churning out those dumplings before I arrived and they were still going even after I was digesting!  Each one of my dumplings were carefully crafted by very skilled hands! Knowing this made eating the dumplings even more special!   If you enjoy dumplings and are in the Toronto area, come check this place out!"}
{"text":"As authentic as it gets. Beef Noodles and General Tso's Chicken were top notch. The noodles they use are legit. Not like the hard noodles served in the restaurants in the US. Their portions are generous also. Loved it."}
{"text":"I love dumplings. Love them. And I grew up thinking that they are only to be served as appetizers with more sauces than dumplings on a dish, so it has been wonderful to discover that there are restaurants where dumplings are the star item.  I did takeout from Mother's on a Saturday night and was pretty excited about it. I must have read the Yelp page about a gazillion times and I have to hand it to you, Yelpers, you were spot on.  My order consisted of pan-fried bak choi, mushroom, and tofu dumplings and the onion pancake. The dumplings were devine! There was some noodley action on the inside but I was kind of into it.  The onion pancake was too much for me. It was fried and doughy and oniony, and while I typically like all of these things, it was overwhelming. I guess it was just too much fried food; most of the time when I was eating, I wish I had a salad instead of an onion pancake. I'm glad I gave it a go but I am not sure if I'd order it again.  For $11.12, I got ten dumplings and a whole meal of fried deliciousness, plus some steamy glasses when I went inside to pick up my food. Mmm."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The pork buns and dumplings were flavourless, the avocado shake was disgusting, the fried pancake was average. Such a shame that food comma went to waste."}
{"text":"Bad service!! Food is ok but a little expensive"}
{"text":"Mom's Dumps is my new favourite place for dim sum.   \"I feel like you guys eat a lot of dumplings\" was recently said to me, about myself and my main squeeze, and I think the party who passed the judgement was correct. I have a huge weakness for Chinese food, especially on holidays. I know this means I'm fulfilling a bucket load of stereotypes, but in this case I'm not bothered.   The lamb dumplings are especially delicious, and the wontons in the wonton soup are soft and brain-like, in a scrumptious way. This beloved Chinese locale is more attractive than its neighbours, and has actual wood tables with no white plastic lazy Susans in sight.   When they're busy they have a knack for accidentally forgetting one or two things that you write down on the order sheet, but they never charge you for it and are always apologetic. Given the volume of customers they handle at once, this really doesn't bother me.   Dance Break: Dumps like a truck, truck, truck. Guys like what, what, what. Give me a dumpliiiing agaiiiin."}
{"text":"Not impressed by the food!!   We ordered soup dumplings, pork and chive, shrimp, and lamb... All meh! The wrappers were way too thick. The insides were okay, but not impressive. Definitely had better in Toronto!  The shrimp rice noodles were slimey and kinda weird tasting....  The one star is really cos the staff were decent."}
{"text":"- Fried long green beans: small portion for the price, not bad but a bit kinda bland IMO - Pan fried dumplings: a bit bland as well - Mapo Tofu: crazy salty, not numbing and not really spicy.  Someone dumped a random jar of chinese spicy chili paste into a pot with tofu.  Embarassment. - Soup dumplings:  kinda sloppy, half were leaking/leaked out, broth wasnt that good - Hot sour soup:  watery and bland, stingy portions  They don't seem to do anything very well.  Service is good at least.  Would rather go to Din Tai Fung or Asian Legend...."}
{"text":"This place is great, very busy they take US dollars but not us credit cards so be sure to get correct currency! They handmake the dumplings! The garlic boo chit us good and various dumplings are so delicious!"}
{"text":"The only time I go out for dumplings is a) if I didn't get any from my parents or b) if I didn't stock up at T & T.  This place is not pretty good for the price.   Maya Postepski (Austra, Trust) sat at the table beside us."}
{"text":"If your coming here, your coming for your dumpling fixing and and boy o boy does Mother know how to fill the void.  Decor wise its nothing spectacular. Like everyone else your here for one reason only .. to eat monstrous portions of dumplings. The best part of this restaurant is watching them hard at work rolling fresh dumplings before your eyes.  As soon as we are seated a complimentary fresh pot of green is served followed by two glasses of ice water.  You have the option of boiled, steamed, or fried dumplings. They give you a sheet of paper with all the menu items and you just check off which ones you want. I always like to get one fried and one boiled for the contrast in textures.  Boiled Pork & Chive Dumplings - Flavourful, juicy, not too soupy, plump filling and tender wrapping  Pan-fried Pork and Bok Choi Dumplings - Crispy, good filling to wrapping ratio, highly addictive  Seaweed Salad - I was curious to try this out...not really my forte...long strips of cold seaweed, plasticy texture with a mild ginger taste. I didn't hate it but didn't love it.  Green Onion Pancake - Crispy, flaky, golden brown, mind onion flavour. Delish!  Beef Onion Roll - This tasted amazing! Like a Chinese version of a wrap. Tender slices of beef on a crispy pancake drizzled with an asian flavoured bbq sauce and green onion rolled up! A must try!  Overall delicious dumplings, generous portions, and fast service! Come to Mother's on an empty stomach because she definitely knows how to feed her children!  Don't forget to order a bag of frozen dumplings to go for those days when you can't make it out, you always be able to satisfy your craving!"}
