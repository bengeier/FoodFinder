{"text":"Not a big fan of when people go \"the cheap\" route, but still expect 4 star quality. Their pizza is super cheap, not fantastic or anything but not horrible. I mean come on, for 5-10 bucks each?! It's a deal no matter how ya slice it. The store is more of a standing room/walk in type, so be sure to call it in so you don't have to stand and wait (if you're THAT upset about having to stand). But the key reason for the high rating isn't the pizza, the cost/value, or the store set up, it's the customer service. Long story short, this location when above and beyond to make sure that we were taken care of after a little mix up on our order. I'd take customer service at a hole in the wall over bull shh service at a gourmet pizza parlor any day. We will be back! *** And since when is someone actually checking your ID to match your card a bad thing?!?! GTHOH, um... they should just have a sign that says, \"NO ID, NO CARD PURCHASES, YOU'RE WELCOME!\""}
{"text":"Okay I usually don't like say anything negative about anyone or business but here is my peace, I ordered a deep dish pizza and two eight piece wings. Given the wings are only $6, however they are like micro wings, almost like they use adolescent chickens instead of full grown chickens...Maybe they do, I dunno. I would like to point out that at no point in this review did I complain or bash the deep dish pizza. Ugh gotta have the yin with the yang I guess!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered food here here multiple times and while it is not what I call the worlds greatest pizza but I have paid more for worse. This is a small place and it seems to always be busy. I continue to go here because of the value and it's not really bad pizza. Nothing else really can really top it as far as I'm concerned, I've tried all the name places."}
{"text":"Hot-n-Ready, not so much! This place was horrible. We stood there for nearly 30 minutes while they tried to pass off old pizza and then served 4 people in front of us with so-called Hot-n-Ready pizzas. Ridiculous! Not even worth a check-in."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service and food. Always fast. Italian cheese bread is the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years, Always fast! Always good service! Thank you very much for being our go to pizza place! See ya soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Little Caesars on the way home.  Asked if the pizza was fresh.  He said he would get me 2 fresh pies.  Waited 20 min. & when I got home the pizza was dried out.  Looked like it
was old.   I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"I don't think it's possible to go wrong with a $5 large pizza. I rarely eat pizza, but tonight was just one of those nights where it had to happen. I reluctantly was dragged to Little Caesar's and was expecting to be grossed out. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and BBQ chicken wings. The pizza was edible (not a fan of pizza) and the chicken wings were pretty good, nothing amazing or out of this world although a little too spicy for my sensitive palate. It was great for the price we paid. If I'm in a bind again and don't feel like cooking, I'll order from here again."}
{"text":"Hot and ready doesn't apply to this location! 3rd time I came in for a pizza and they don't have any made going to be a 10-15 min wait they said again ok left and called domino by the time I get there it'll be ready"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong w/ $5 pizzas! Not much of a selection but it's STILL GOOD. The wings are great as well. Don't forget the dips for it! One of my favs is the italian cheese bread. So yummy! Kids luv the breadsticks.  Luv to go here when I'm in a rush to get lunch or dinner.  The wait isn't very long either.  This particular location is also clean."}
{"text":"Hot & Ready pizzas are never ready to go at this location. There's always a line & a 15 minute wait. I don't know if it's under new management, they used to be better."}
{"text":"It was Little Caesar. I ordered 11 pizzas for the Super Bowl. They weren't the warmest but adequate.

It was Little Caesar."}
{"text":"Well I guess it is little Caesars so you cannot expect much. We were told our order would be ready at noon 15 minutes later I finally get my order when multiple people who come in after me leave before me. Disappointing overall. I'm sure the pizzas will eat same disappointing taste in my mouth as the service. Subpar"}
{"text":"Apparently, if you order a pizza it is okay to give a pizza that has two pieces missing toppings and cheese instead of remaking it in the first place.  I called the store after I opened the pizza box when I made it home.  I did not have time to go back up there with the pizza and swap it for a new one.  This is the only resolution they gave.  I generally order there once a week and have found their quality has been slipping the last several weeks.  I will be buying my pizza elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Everytime I go into the shop I have to wait for someone to take my order when there is no one in from of me. I even have to wait for the hot and read pizzas. There are not living up to the name. I have visited there 3 times in the last month and it's the same everytime."}
{"text":"I've never really had good from little Caesar's, until I moved to Hender\"tucky\". 

The pizza places around here, just aren't that good. Between hair being baked into my pizza, grease and awful crust.... I had just about given up on finding pizza by our home.

One night, my guy brought home LC. 
I was skeptical. I mean, with all the \"pizza\" spots we had tried, how was I going to enjoy this ....?

Gladly, I was wrong.

The deep deep dish pizza has always been executed well. Crunchy crust, just enough golden brown cheese.  My newest addition is the pretzel pizza, that uses a cheese sauce instead of tomato, and has lovely pieces of salt around the crust.

The thing that annoys me...
There are only four chairs. Pretty much standing room only. And they need your ID for any credit card. I mean, really for a $7 purchase...?"}
{"text":"Good cheap pizza, Been there twice did not have to wait the first time had to wait about 15 min. second time but it was for the new smokehouse pizza. Don't care for the parking lot."}
{"text":"Super CHEAP, and pretty good too.  I love the breadsticks and the cheesy bread.  For less than $10 I can feed my family, so you can't complain too much about that."}
{"text":"Store opens up at 11am.  I walk in at 1104am to order 2 cheese, one pepperoni, and 2 crazy breads.  And of course, NO Hot N' Ready available.  Was told it would take 10 min.  Order was not ready until 1128am.

After I received my food I requested to speak with the manager regarding not the customer service (which is always great by the front staff), but the consistency of never having Hot N' Ready pizzas as Little Ceasars advertise as available.  I have gone like today when they open, mid afternoon, early to late evening.  No matter what time of day, the availability of Hot N' Ready is never available.  

Customer service has always been great and have no concerns with the quality of food, however, addressed the continuous issue of Hot N' Ready never being available, though this is what Little Ceasars advertises and is known for.  She immediately attempted to deflect and minimize my statement by stating that I could order online or call in (which is something I usually do because of this issue).  She stated that there food is always hot, and as I replied stating that I understand these two additional options of ordering, this is not what I was stating was that there seems to never be Hot N' Ready available at this location.  

Will travel a few more miles to another location.  Worth the extra \"10-15\" minute wait/drive time\"."}
{"text":"employee Dylan at the front counter was very excellent at doing his job and staying focused and not talking to his peers. Very good"}
{"text":"Called our order ahead of time, which was the smarted thing. No wait, order was ready and pizza was good. Can't go wrong getting crazy bread too."}
{"text":"Horrible they don't take bills over 20.00 and the total way 24.00 ... Wtf bullshit terrible service"}
{"text":"Everytime I ordered here the Pizza has been excellent, the service is great when they take your order. I usually call ahead now and get parmesean cheese crust and light sauce it taste so good."}
{"text":"Call ahead and your life will be better if u want a custom made pizza on a Friday evening after work! I called ahead and the guy said 10 min.. I started my timer and it was ready exactly on time! Even during their rush the associates were cool, calm , and friendly.  My pizza was fresh, delicious, and right on time! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"How hard is it to make a cardboard tasting pizza. They never have the hot and ready pizza available. Always have to wait 10 to 15 min. This store is horrible. Next time the kids want crap pizza from here I will drive a little farther. 0 Stars  I guess if you want to do it old-school style call ahead order your pizza But no one will answer the phone it just rings and rings"}
{"text":"FOOD: I got the vegetarian pizza from here and it was delicious! It was great to bite into and the flavours of all the toppings were perfect! I enjoyed every bite! No seating, take out only! 

PLACE: Super fast! Took only 7 minutes or so to make me a brand new pizza! Employee was super nice. Place was clean and organized. 

PRICE: $$ reasonable $12 for the pizza and dip"}
{"text":"When they tell you it's going to be 5 minutes for a pizza, expect to wait 45-50 minutes. 

The annoying part is they didn't acknowledge giving everyone their order before ours... Because we had to remind them that we were still waiting. They asked our name and our full order again, likkkkeeeeeeee did you think I was sitting here for fun? 

If something is taking longer, tell the customer instead of pretending we don't exist. And please know their order when they ask on the status!! We see you're busy but it's ridiculous that we wait an almost an hour for pizza you claim to be \"hot and ready.\""}
{"text":"Torn on this review. Half of me loves junky fast food. The other half wants to be healthy and eat only delicious healthy food. 

The review of this place is biased then from a junk food perspective. Is it the best pizza I've ever had...no! Is it close? ....no! Is it still a good option when compared to other pizza joints? Maybe. Salty, greasy, premade pizza. 

Somehow, that wasn't a deal breaker for me but still a good 3/5 for a pizza that is in your hands in less than 2 mins."}
{"text":"Tried their deep dish pizza with 3 meats for $12.99. Love the crunchy outer crust. 

On the menu I did not see a chicken pizza but I know I had it at another Little Caesar location. Ask the person at the counter for a chicken pizza and she said they will make it for me. It took about 7 minutes and it was done. Cost $8.50. 

Before handing me my order she threw in an a bag of cheesy bread stick on the house. That was so nice of her. Probably their strategy to get future business and it works. I will be going back again when craving pizza."}
{"text":"I've been to probably 5 or 6 little Caesar all great ... Except this one. I would've thought they were given a standard recipe for their pizzas but I have no clue what these people are doing when they make a hot n ready . They don't use gloves when they make it so that's another plus... It's a real shame this is the only location near me because I really do like little Caesars just not this trash ! Avoid here if you like the way food tastes because this is far from that."}
{"text":"Worst Deep Dish of ANY Little Caesars Pizza in Greater Las Vegas. Death Valley has more tomato sauce than they gave me the last time I went there. What really makes me mad is that I asked for EXTRA sauce and they charged me extra for it too! The GOOD NEWS is that I found the BEST Little Caesars in Henderson. In the Smiths shopping center at corner of Eastern Ave and Horizon Ridge Parkway. If you like Little Caesar's tomato sauce, call that location, ask for Lisa and tell her you want the GLENN EXTRA SAUCE SPECIAL. Not only will Lisa pile it on for you, you won't be charged extra and you'll leave there with the heaviest and tastiest deep dish pizza you've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Little Caesars is by no means a 4 star pizza place - not even close. But I'm pretty sure everyone knows what to expect when they step inside this place. You're getting a $5 pizza, and if you get what you pay for, don't expect much. 

That being said, I have a family of myself and 3 men. Well, one man and two boys. But those boys are already eating us out of house and home and they're not even out of diapers yet. About once a month we go for some really cheap pizza when things get tight between paychecks and mommy doesn't feel like slaving away in the kitchen. This is always our store of choice, partly from location and also from quality. 

I've dealt with other LCs before on many occasions and have been served pizzas that taste like cardboard with a smattering of marinara sauce. Sometimes the pizzas are clearly old and stale. Sometimes there's no cheese on some of the slices. Not this place. 

I have never once been served an inedible pizza from this LC. The pizzas are ALWAYS fresh - usually many times better than we expect. But since it's a $5 pizza, I say again - don't expect much. The management team must really have it nailed down here. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Lil Caesar used to be great for a quick pizza, but they have totally lost their pizza making mo-jo!  Their new filled crust is to be passed on at all costs, period; no if, and, or buts. They use a processed rolled cheese that doesn't melt within the crust and there is nothing like biting into a cheese pizza with an unmelted chunk of cheese.  Now, we like pepperoni but not when the grease is soaking thru the box and it was a result of way too thin crust.  Nasty nasty nasty!!  The wings were ok, and that's just it--ok. 
Don't get sucked in with this new promo of stuffed crust. It's a downer."}
{"text":"I dont know how someone can write an entirely positive review and still give only a 3 stars. This place is amazeballs. The specials are cheaper than the elgin mills location that is closer to me. The cornmeal on the pizza bottom is soooooo guuuuuuuud. Wings are just delish, they toss it in sauce after theyre ready. The bacon honey mustard sauce is *high pitched voice* to diiiiieeee for. They are smaller wings but meat is always juicy and skin is flavourful. Marinara sauce is $1 and is a GENEROUS portion. Wait time is less than pizza pizza too. No seating, take out only."}
{"text":"Pizza was okay. They are very busy and ghe wait is long during dinner time. You can't beat $5 pizza-"}
{"text":"Good quick pizzas!!

Always friendly staff! pizza is cooked consistently.

Can't beat the price for medium cheese pizza, and is always ready!!

Kids love it!

Lots of parking in plaza!
In and out in a few minutes!! Fast!!"}
{"text":"I like going to this location. The staff is very friendly and they will always let me know how much time it will take for a pizza that's not ready ( I like hawaiian and it's not always ready).    It also does not take long to make them. The only inconvenient is that it can be hard to exit the plaza during rush hard."}
{"text":"Today was a hungover, let's get some cheap pizzas kinda of day.  LC is right across the street from my apartment so we came here for their $5 Hot N Ready pepperoni pizzas.  

The place is small.  There were a lot of people with the same kind of idea as I.  Not much sitting and standing room, so I felt like I was inconvenient to other customers, blocking the counter after I was done ordering, since I had nowhere else to stand.  

For the pizzas and amount I ordered, I had to end up waiting 10 minutes because they didn't have it ready.  Completely understandable.  What really turned me off was the fact that the cashier kept apologizing to me every minute.  To me, there is such thing as over apologizing and this was a perfect example of that.  Maybe she felt like I didn't seem happy as my sunglasses were on the whole time, however, I had to end up telling her to stop apologizing as I was getting a little ticked off.  

The pizzas were alright.  Not as cheesy as I would like them to be.  A lot of sauce and the crust was dry.  I bought 3 total pizzas, so I'm curious to see how they stack up against the cold pizza test.  Whenever I get pizza leftovers, I LOVE eating it straight out of the refrigerator.  I wonder how this pizza will stack up.

Overall, I guess it's good for the price.  I personally think that I wasn't as satisfied as I should, but I did see a meat pizza for $9 bucks, so the next time I'm in this mood, maybe I'll try that!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza, indicated 20 minutes. Was ready, hot and everything we expected.
Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"It's OK. The Hot N Ready is pretty much never ready, so I now call in ahead of time, even if I'm just ordering a pepperoni pizza. The lines can also get kind of slow and long at this location, which isn't really in the best area to begin with. I sometimes drive out of my way to the one over on Sunset & Valle Verde just to avoid this one, because they never have lines and always have Hot N Ready pizzas ready."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh LC, how I love you for so many reasons!!! The cheesy bread here is friggin amazing. It really is hit and miss for most people. You either love it or you don't. 

Personally, in my opinion, you can't compare this pizza chain to any other. It's one in its own. Walk in pizzas readily available for $5-8 bucks. Obviously they won't be as good or fresh as a freshly made pizza pulled out of the oven. BUT YOU COME HERE KNOWING THIISSSSSSS!!! 

The pizza crust is the perfect firmness every time and the toppings are a-ok in my books. Absolutely love the cheese bread. 

Not \"authentic\" pizza, not always the freshest (though you can wait and order a fresh one), but when in a hurry, when hungry and when you don't feel like spending $20 on a 3 topping medium, this place is your best friend!"}
{"text":"The pizza here always seems to be a bit old. Also one of the employees locked the door 5 hours before closing."}
