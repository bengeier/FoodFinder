{"text":"Great neighborhood joint! It's a place to go when you're craving good steak but don't want to pay steakhouse prices. The service is always excellent, and I don't think I've ever had a bad item on the menu."}
{"text":"Consistent is a great word to describe this place. The food is consistently great; the service is consistently great; the regulars are consistently there. (they're great too). It has a comfortable smoking/drinking patio and great prices during happy hour. The staff and owner is always (consistently) accommodating and friendly. You feel like you are part of the family here.   Food I'd recommend: Any fish served Greek style, the Prime Rib, the burgers and definitely the fillet medallions with the gorgonzola wine sauce. All the food is good though and you gotta love the salad bar!"}
{"text":"I drive by here everyday and just recently noticed it. I just wish I would have found it sooner! I went for brunch on Mother's day here. I was immediately greeted at the door with a friendly smile. Then places at a table in a very nice room and coffee and drink were brought out quickly.   For brunch they had a prime rib eggs Benedict. Holy S***!!! It was amazing! The meat was so tender and cut like a firm cheese. The sauce was perfect and plentiful. The side of roasted potatoes were seasoned to perfection."}
{"text":"Feeney's used to be a wonderful restaurant.  However, I have not enjoyed the last 3 meals I received there.  You should get more than 4 shrimp in the shrimp scampi for the price, there is simply something wrong with the cheese on the pasta, and the I had to throw away the last steak because it was just fat.  Hopefully, things will improve in the future."}
{"text":"I live in the area nearby Feeney's and when I drove by tonight it smelled amazing, so I decided to stop in and get my dinner to go. I heard that that this place was the first Beefeaters restaurant in Phoenix, so I had high expectations. The restaurant was a small but quaint establishment it with a nice intimate ambiance. When I sat down bartender was extremely busy, so I was offered little guidance with the menu. The bar was somewhat crowded, and there was clearly only 1 bartender for the whole restaurant.  The prime rib was tasty, although a little fattier than I like and had very little marbling.  The mashed potatoes were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Unfortunately, when I opened the soup it looked (and tasted) just like beef barley. Since I ordered clam chowder, I thought they obviously made a mistake, so I returned thinking it was an error. I spoke with a well dressed older gentleman, whom I presume was a manager and after I explained the mix up,  he explained that they only serve \"Manhattan Style\" chowder.  When I indicated that I didn't care for it at all, he simply replied that it came with my dinner, and I was not charged for the soup.  I left without further pressing the issue, however, I was truly disappointed that not even an offer was made to give me something else that I would have enjoyed. The food was OK, but avoid the clam chowder - IMHO it was not good at all. I would also suggest to management,  that if a guest cares enough to return to your establishment, regardless of the cost of the item, you should make it right."}
{"text":"I honestly wish I could give this place 20 stars! Places like this do still exist, and it's awesome! The place itself is almost like being back home, and seeing your loved ones. They welcomed us with open arms, and treated us like family. The food was AMAZING!!!! The owners were AWESOME!!! The wait staff was extremely attentive and made sure we had everthing we needed. Feeneys is to me, a diamond in the ruff. We cannot wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed going to Feeneys, for their great food, nightly specials and to enjoy drinks with friends on their patio. Now after the resent renovations, the fresh look , and atmosphere makes Feeneys my favorite place for dinning and drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful people! We were visiting from out of state, looking for a great steakhouse, and could NOT have had a better experience! We've eaten at some of the \"well known\" Phoenix steakhouses in the past, but will forever come back to Feeney's when given the opportunity! The flaming cheese (Saganaki) was wonderful, entrees (filet, strip steak, twice baked potatoes) were fabulous, and the dessert was AMAZING!!! A definite must do for any visit to Phoenix! Quick tip- they must've switched web hosts- to see the menu go to: feeneysaz.foursquare.com."}
{"text":"This place is very outdated on the decore, and the customers are kinda older too, but they are on to something! they have a great salad bar and a great menu! everyone who was working there seemed happy and helpful.  The drinks are GREAT as well! Everyone I know loves the Monday night burger special........ $4 burgers with fries so they say! I stick with the fish and chips! they are amazing!"}
{"text":"this is a great place to go if you're looking for quality food at AFFORDABLE prices and a nice cozy atmosphere! they specialize in steaks and seafood but have other choices on the menu. i think this is a romantic place. it's small,  the lighting is low, candles on the table, and just all around intimate. this is not a large chain type of restaurant where you will be lost in the crowd and ignored.  the steaks & primerib are great. the prices are very affordable, much cheaper then anything like outback steakhouse or black angus. i get a large steak for about $15.00 and the primerib is priced under $24.  there are numerous daily fish specials to choose from which range anywhere from $9-$13. there are all sorts of fish dinners. you get an all you can eat salad bar with all meals. the appetizers are good and all appetizers are priced under $8. we always get the calamari. they do have a small bar area in the front. THE SERVICE IS ALWAYS BEYOND GOOD. THE WAIT STAFF IS VERY FRIENDLY AND THE OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT WILL ALWAYS COME BY AND GREET YOU AND MAKE SURE YOU ARE HAPPY WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE. they treat you very well and appreciate their guests. i go to this restaurant for all special occasions.  as an added benefit, THIS RESTAURANT IS ON  RESTAURANT.COM    IF YOU GO TO THIS WEBSITE, YOU WILL GET $25 OFF YOUR BILL OF $50 OR MORE. feeney's is on 12st, just south of glendale."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Phoenix to get some ribs! I wish I could come here every night. It is a family run restaurant that welcomes everyone. All the food is great, but the ribs in my opinion are the best thing on the menu. The service is great and it complements the fact that they are making the best food ever. So come try Fenny's in Phoenix, Arizona."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for dinner last week. I have driven by many times and saw the great reviews on Yelp. Our waitress who is also the owner was so welcoming and helpful.  I ordered an end-cut piece of prime rib and the salad bar. Nice selection of fresh salad items and salad. The prime rib was excellent, actually the best piece I've had since moving to Arizona in 1981. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Yum! Where do I start...from the Saganaki (flaming cheese) appetizer, Awesome Salad Bar, Amazing Entrees...Everything is Delicious!!! Today I had the Filet Medallions over Gorgonzola cheese mashed potatoes...OMG! So yummy! And of course the staff is amazing! Love Maria, George, Judy and all!! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very good local steakhouse. The wine was good and VERY reasonably priced. I had Prime Rib which was delicious and my husband had sirloin and shrimp. Sides were okay but save room for dessert....the cheesecake is made in house and is worth every calorie! We will be coming back...like the old school atmosphere and welcoming employees!"}
{"text":"Thought it was a dive bar until I read the yelp reviews. Definitely not a dive bar. Phenomenal prime rib!!"}
{"text":"Great cozy restaurant. Food is good especially the salad bar. Top sirloin was good and my husband enjoyed the prime rib. The service was not the best. We were never brought any bread and it took a long time to order another round of drinks. When my beer came, it wasn't cold. All in all, we will return."}
{"text":"I love this place they have the best prices for the quality of food they serve and when you go there you feel welcomed. Maria and George run the place they are great super friendly, and  you will always see them with a smile ! The best for last best prime rib in town by far keep it up guys !"}
{"text":"The potato skins were yummy! My Feenies burger was pretty good, although I tend to like my burger a little messier. The staff there was extremely accommodating and nice"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar. Took my friends there after they helped me move just around the corner from Feenys. I've enjoyed it ever since. Awesome peeps and great hospitality."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly but the food was terrible. Salad bar looked days old and the prime rib was the worst I have ever had."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of Feeney's but I've only been there about a half-dozen times because there always seemed to be somewhere else to go for a bite or a brew. But I was in the mood for a good old-fashioned steak dinner and made a point of heading there tonight. I won't be back.  There's charm inside this building, if a little stuffy and warm on a summer evening, and there's no denying the friendliness of the staff. But friendliness and charm aren't substitutes for quality and service. On past visits, I've eaten in the little sitting area off the bar, which is more casual and under the eye of the bartender. Previous meals have been fish and chips, burgers, and appetizers, and they've been mostly suitable. I guess I don't have high expectations for potato skins and calamari, snacks that could've come from a bag in the freezer, but I was disappointed by fish and chips, an entrée that looks like it fell from a TV dinner carton. That experience kept me from returning to the dinner menu for a couple of years. No matter. I was in the mood for red meat and that is supposed to be their specialty.  I ordered the top sirloin steak medium-rare and French fries. I got a thick steak on the wrong side of medium-well and pedestrian shoestring potatoes that were cold to the touch and basically inedible. The steak tasted fine but with almost no pink inside, it was some tough chewing. Maybe the cook made the fries too soon and overcooked the steak by accident or maybe the server forgot to pick up my order and it sat on a counter, the steak continuing to cook from carryover heat while the fries cooled down. Considering how seldom I saw my server and how long it took to get my order, either explanation is plausible.  Local restaurants are fun to patronize but it's not worth it if the product is overpriced and the service is lacking. My money will go where it spends the best. It won't be spent at Feeney's any longer."}
{"text":"We are visiting Phoenix and wanted a good steak that didn't break the bank so we went with the good reviews and were not disappointed! Maria is a warm wonderful hostess that made us feel at home and recommended the NY sirloins which were melt in your mouth fantastic! This place is very old school (think Ponderosa) with their chilled plates for the salad bar and dinner rolls but what it lacks in modern decor is balanced by the perfectly cooked steaks and fantastic service. I even got a hug on the way out from Maria, this is exactly what the hubby & I needed so five stars for food & service."}
{"text":"Excellent  Amsphere, great staff, and good food! Love this place!"}
{"text":"They really need to update their website! Went in for the HH specials and apparently no more happy hour to speak of! Also, the 10% off coupon  on the website  is no longer offered. I wish I could give their amazing bartender 4 stars while just giving the establishment 1! She is the ONLY redeeming quality they have."}
{"text":"Such a great place! We have lived just down the street from it for a while but finally decided to give it a try last night. The food was great the atmosphere was even better and the service was wonderful. We had our two children with us and one of the waitresses (who wasn't even our server) made a point to introduce herself and ask the kids' names; they were very welcoming. They have a great menu for both food and drinks and the salad bar was good too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is an amazing hidden gem in Central Phoenix. Maria and George are amazing hosts. The atmosphere is perfect and the food is outstanding. Outside seating with big screen is great for game day.   A must if you are in Phoenix"}
{"text":"I bought a few restaurant.com gc's & Feeney's was one of them. I have never been here, let alone heard of this place, but I checked it out on Yelp & the reviews were positive so I thought why not?!   We arrived at about 8pm this past Saturday. It wasn't busy but it wasn't dead either, I would say there were about 10 other parties there maybe more. From the looks of the building & decor it seemed that Feeney's had been around for quite some time, definitely had character.   For starters we ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms & I ordered a couple cocktails (strawberry vodka w/cranberry juice-yum!). The app was pretty good but it lacked flavor. I have to say Red Lobster's version is better. For our entrees, my hubby ordered the king crab legs & I ordered the filet medalions. You can't really go wrong w/crab legs, hubby loved them! I had a bite & the meat was sweet & very fresh. I am never one to clean my plate, but I finished my entire entree! The meat was cooked perfectly (medium-rare) & the mashed potatoes/asparagus were delicious as well. I wish I had received more asparagus though, only 2 pieces were given. Oh & I almost forgot, our meals came with their famous salad bar. Our salads were pretty good but kinda boring. I thought there would be more of a wow factor there but it wasn't a disappointment or anything since I am not really a \"salad person\". After devouring our meals we were stuffed but I wanted dessert for later so I ordered their mud pie to go. It was pretty standard but damn it was good. Chocolate cookie crust, mocha ice cream & chocolate ganache-freakin delish!   With the $25 gc our total came to about $70 (including tip). Not cheap, especially for the area, but I have to say it was pretty good! We would definitely come back, I am curious to try their $4 burger special on Mondays."}
{"text":"Feeney's is the best! I have been going for years and it's always been amazing. The salad bar is always a favorite. It's always fresh and packed with great veggies. The prime rib and the prime rib sandwich are the best I've ever had. I've tried a lot of prime rib at very expensive restaurants and Feeneys is by far the best. The sandwich bun is so soft and so delicious. The meet cooked perfectly at medium rare. I can't say enough about this place, the food, the service, the owners are all amazing. It's like your neighborhood Cheers where everyone knows your name, but the food is amazing to match!"}
{"text":"I met two friends at the restaurant who had previously eaten there.  They said it had great food and it was their neighborhood go to place.  They had always had great experiences and so did I.  I ordered the Greek Salad and my friends ordered the Shepherd Pie and the spaghetti.  We all loved the food.  The service is just the right amount of friendly.  They are attentive and seem to be available just when you need them but they do not hover over you.  The prices were in the medium range.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I love the local vibe of this place. It's very old school, nice old bar, low ceilings, dark lighting, etc. The food is very good, especially if you can get the prime rib. Salad bar has lots of selection. Can't go wrong. Parking can be a challenge on busy nights."}
{"text":"I genuinely cannot believe I haven't reviewed Feeney's. I look back at my reviews and it's like I'm emerging from a fog. A year flew by and I didn't review anything. I could have sworn I had reviewed Feeney's. So big a part has Feeney's played in my life this past year, it's like I've never NOT gone to Feeney's.   The first time I went to Feeney's was like every time I go to Feeney's. I marvel at its bald-faced lack of pretension. This is a restaurant by and for people who remember what restaurants used to be like before chains became the norm and non-chains realized they were special and started becoming overpriced poor-value destinations (cough-Durants-cough).   If you grew up in the 70s or 80s, you will instantly recognize this place. Dingy without being dirty, all dark woods and low ceilings and Irish village frescoes. At first, you will wonder how it could possibly have stayed in business while maintaining this look, because most of the places that looked like this flatly could not keep up with changing tastes and increasing demands for quality and flair. Then you eat and you realize the truth: Feeny's keeps it simple with can't-miss old-school standards and top notch preparation and quality.  It starts with the salad bar. That's right - that relic of the 70s and 80s where you are told you are welcome to go ahead and serve yourself while you wait for your dinner to be prepared. Not well stocked enough to be a meal on its own (which is as it should be), the salad bar is the perfect appetizer. What's there are all the standards for a competent salad, is fresh, delicious and even the dressings taste home made. If it starts with the salad bar, it finishes with a flourish with the entrees. Real deal steaks and seafood, prepared simply and competently. I always get the prime rib. In fact, the reason we found Feeney's was because I was in the mood for a prime rib and we went looking for one locally. I was not disappointed. Perfectly prepared with a side of au jus and creamed horseradish, if you like prime rib, you will be intimately familiar with its presentation here.   I should mention that the service has never been anything short of top-notch. Even at their busiest, we receive constant, uninvasive attention from the host, waiters and other staff.  In short, if you're looking for a homey independent throwback that has class-A food and service at reasonable prices, give Feeney's a try, you'll love it. I know we do."}
{"text":"probably one of my favs!  Escargot is amazing, loads of voices for small plates. The roast beef with herb cheese bruschetta is like a small sandwich of goodnessSince this is a neighborhood place for me I frequent often with my friend. Never a disappointment this STAFF is fabulous! Judy And Amanda never stop smiling and they HUSTLE to get your order in. Their prime rib and seafood is deliciously prepared!   go for happy hour but definitely stay for dinner!"}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that I came in craving a beef Wellington & my craving was definitely fulfilled! On top of the wonderful Wellington, the service was top notch. The bus boy was one of the friendliest guys I've met, so talkative & attentive. Our server & owner, George, was great. When you check in on yelp you get free potato skins, which were yummy! But on top of that, George gave us two free glasses of wine, for what he claimed to be \"a long wait\". We were enjoying our time, certainly didn't think we had been waiting long for our food at all. And finally, because it was our first time there, he brought us a delicious mud pie. Seriously... We needed them to wheel barrel us out of there, we had so much food.   They're a family run business, which I can appreciate as I have a family run business as well. They made us feel so welcome. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best prime rib around (usually).  The salad bar is amazing too...  They have a $4 burger Monday now too, which really gets the place packed.  Really good date place I'd say except for Mondays when it is packed full of people eating cheap burgers.  Really quality local restaurant all around."}
{"text":"If you were to ask me how I would describe Feeney's Bar and Grill, I'd say \"Good food and atmosphere ruined by overall lackluster service and a rude bartender.\"   We had been waiting for 20 minutes before I got impatient and had to ask for service. It was another 10 before someone had come to see us. Our waitress was friendly enough but after taking our drink order she decided to walk away for another 10 minutes before coming back to complete our order.  We did not feel like valued customers at this point.  However, what really ruined the overall experience was the rude and snarky bartender. She had come to drop our drinks off but when I tried to inquire about thet waitress she cut me off and said I'm a bartender not a waitress and walked off. She may've been having a bad night, but this act certainly made our experience bad.  Lastly, I'd recommend the Salisbury steak if you do go, but the potato skins were tasteless and boring."}
{"text":"Prime rib is always available and it is excellent. What is missing from most of the reviews is the 80+ beers available. A really outstanding list. Fine food, but a family/casual feel. Greek choices on the appetizers is a good move."}
{"text":"We had not been in for a while, so when we spotted a new sign and some new additions to the front, we figured we'd give it another go.  We would have wasted less time and had a better time if we'd just thrown $100 in the trash.  I ordered the Butterflied Filet on top of mashed potatoes with the Gorgonzola sauce, my husband had the prime rib. The prime rib was fatty and gristly. The filet arrived covered in gravy.  I'd forgotten that it had the gorgonzola sauce, so I didn't mention it. But if the sauce was unavailable, it should have been brought to my attention so I could either order it without the sauce, with the gravy, or made another selection altogether.   I cut into the meat and it was either not a filet at all or it was a low-grade fatty meat...not lean and tender like a normal tenderloin.  Worse, were the potatoes and gravy...the potatoes either came from a box or were not fresh and the gravy was either over-salted or it came from a jar. I ate a couple of bites, and couldn't eat anymore.  Let me stress that this would not have been a problem if we were paying $10 at the Golden Corral.  And we recently had a similar meal at a place that was about $20 less and 3 stars more.  I am rarely picky about food, I more often bang places on their service. I probably also should have said something.  But I also didn't feel like there was a way to remedy the situation...a sad and drab place that serves sad and drab food probably couldn't have re-made the meal so it was any better.  Better to cut our losses and leave.    We went to the Cheesecake Factory where we could count on some consistency, even though we'd rather frequent our local businesses.  As for all of the 5-star reviews...that I cannot explain.  Lots of people from out of town talking about how fabulous this little hole in the wall and including all kinds of photos...hmmmmm.  Definitely not a 4-star place.  And definitely not a place where we'll take our hard-earned money again."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends for $5 burgers with fries on Mondays. We had to vallet park, which I didn't expect. We were seated promptly in a place that took me back to my childhood. It was almost like I was back in Maine in the 1980s going out to dinner with my parents. The decor...the servers...the salad bar. I skipped the burgers and just got the salad bar....it is very cool, but I was disappointed in the salad bar. There were no tomatoes and the potato salad was 100% mayo with some random pieces of potato. Perhaps I came on an off night, because my friends have been before and they love it. I'll give it another go and see if the salad bar experience improves."}
{"text":"I found Feeney's on Yelp.  Many good reviews so I thought we should give it a try.  I am so glad we did.  We visited for dinner.  You would probably drive right by it if you did not know it was there.  As far as decor goes, the restaurant is a throwback to the eighties for sure.  It was very clean though.  I had the Oscar Tournedos and my husband had the Prime Rib.  Both were excellent!    Our waitress, Maria, was a very nice woman.  Attentive but not overly so.  She seemed to know everyone that walked in the door.  It was easy to see that once you eat here, you will be back.  The salad bar threw me off a bit, but I liked the fact that they had cold, metal salad plates.  Everything was fresh and their vinaigrette was delicious.  My dish was beautifully presented.  My husband had fries with his Prime Rib.  They were thick cut but they were perfectly crunchy on the outside and light and tender inside.  Prices were very reasonable.  I am excited to go back for lunch next time.  If you have not been here, you must try it.!"}
{"text":"I live in Glendale, and my girlfriend and I were on the east side to take care of some business. We got hungry at about 4:00 pm, and decided to find a local place to sit down and have food that wasn't at Denny's or fast food. We settled on Feeney's. It is one of those hole-in-the-wall places, but it is quite elegant inside. Outside appearance is certainly deceiving.   I will not review ambiance or time, nor will I compare foods with each other, because we went after lunch rush and before dinner rush and have only eaten there once. We cannot rate what they are best for, or what days are easiest or funnest because we ate on a Thursday between lunch and dinner and were pretty much the only diners at that time (which was awesome!). I ordered the half-rack pork ribs, with a side of baked potato and salad bar. She ordered the salisbury steak with a side of sweet potato fries and salad bar.  Establishment: As you walk in, you are greeted warmly. Their color theme is dark, matching the stone walls and dim lighting. It is pretty cozy, so it is not a place I would recommending taking rowdy kids. Besides, there isn't really a kid's menu. The bar is off to the right, and the dining is throughout. They do have a nice foyer for busier times, I guess. There are about 4-6 televisions throughout, with HD programming. One downside is that the patio for the smokers is in the front, but nothing can really be done to change how that is, except for moving to a new building. It is kind of secluded, so you may not have to worry about the smells. Parking is kind of small. You might have a hard time parking your limousine, but there is plenty of it. Just check it out on Google Satellite.   Salad bar: I always love the salad bars when I go to the buffet, mainly because they have all the fixin's. Feeney's is not a buffet, but hey! theres a salad bar! This one is pretty awesome, and yes, it has all the fixin's, even jello (which I found interesting). The ranch dressing is made in-house, and it is oh-my-god delicious, as ranch goes. Very sweet tasting. The only discrepancy I have with this salad bar is that it is mostly just dinner salad lettuce (iceberg) mixed in with a little romaine. I think it would be cool if they can offer some variety, like spinach, or spring mix. All the salad bar products are chilled and sneeze guarded.   Entree: The pork ribs were pretty good. They pour on the barbecue sauce, and it is thick and tangy. The meat is fall-off-the-bone tender, but I can say that mine was a little too dry; not dry enough to send back, but maybe overcooked by about 30-45 seconds. The barbecue sauce made up for it though. My baked potato was cooked to perfection. I did find it convenient that you can get any toppings for your baked potato at the salad bar. Our hostess gave us a small sample bowl of the Soup of the Day, to share, as both of us ordered the salad bar. We thought that was a nice gesture. My lady's salisbury steak came with brown gravy sauce and sauteed mushrooms and onions. She said the flavor was great, and the toppings were just right. This is not your Banquet frozen dinner salisbury. It is very hearty and juicy. The only complaint she had was that it was a little too seared on the bottom (heat a little too high in the skillet when cooked). Like my ribs, it was not enough to send it back, because the flavor was very good. This isn't Hell's Kitchen, after all. She also liked her sweet potato fries; she had them with the ranch dressing.  Customer Service: The customer service here was great. It was easy to talk to the hostess and waitress. They greeted us with a smile, and were very sociable. They really went above and beyond to make sure that our visit was top notch.   Recommendation: My girlfriend and I would definitely eat here again when on the east side. Price is okay. I do not eat anything too fancy anywhere I go (I am a student), but entrees range from $10 for the sandwiches, salads and chicken all the way to about $30 for the beef wellingtons and seafood. I think the only fault with the building is that the smoking area is in the front, so you have to walk by the smokers to get in, but it isn't like they can demo the building and make a new one. Small downside. When we went there, it was just some old men chewing the fat, smoking their cigars. I am giving them 4 stars just based on the slightly overcooked food, but that may change with time, I suppose."}
{"text":"Mmm i love feeneys and it also helps that its a redskins bar considering my boyfriend is a skins fan. We are there every Sunday morning"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue! My husband and I came in one afternoon to grab lunch and we absolutely loved the charm, service and food. My mother in law was coming into town the next week so we thought it would be a great idea to bring the whole family to dinner here. My husband made the reservation but then had to change the day, time and amount of guests multiple times and Judy was the sweetest and didn't blink an eye at all of our changes. She reserved the private room for us and the service and food was amazing again! The young man who helped serve us is so nice and polite even though we had a rather large rowdy group and a cranky toddler. We are future regulars and definitely appreciate how nice and attentive the staff always is. Anyway, the reason I ended up posting this review now is because my husband is still going on about how delicious the pasta bolegnese was weeks later. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Best Prime Rib Ever! I've been around the country and the world. This little whole in the wall homely restaurant has THE BEST Prime Rib! You have to go to the little gem!"}
{"text":"I've lived a rock's throw away from this joint for over 6 months now, and I didn't even realize the absolute gem that is Feeney's, until this afternoon!  I had heard an excellent review of their salad bar at work from a client, and decided to check it out! The overall feel of the place is welcoming, and up beat!  The dimly lit atmosphere is reminiscent of a dive bar (in a good way), but Feeney's is WAY cleaner and well maintained.  I saw a lot of reviews saying that the vibe was reminiscent of restaurants before major chains were the norm, and where as I may be a little young to remember such a time, I can see what they mean, and agree! Today, I actually decided to stop by to grab a quick salad to go (since I had heard that salad bar was awesome, and it is), but a quick look at their daily special (caramelized apple pork chop, oh em gee AH-MAZING!) and I knew it wouldn't be a salad dinner for me!  The menu has a lot of unique options that you don't see often, including their soup of the day, a Louisiana style seafood soup, london broil and even ESCARGOT!  I can honestly say I've never seen escargot on a menu before!  So I find their menu not only intriguing, but incredibly special!  Some of their dishes are a little on the pricey side, but you certainly get what you pay for, not only in quality and quantity of the food, but also in SERVICE! I myself work in the service industry, and I know how frustrating it can be, but as a result, I hold customer service to a high standard.  Feeney's blew my standards out of the water!  It took only a few minutes to be greeted by Judy, the fabulous bartender, who gave me a lunch and dinner menu to browse through.  I had a few minutes before another gentleman (I'm sad to say I can't remember his name) offered me advice on what to expect from various dishes.  I ended up deciding on the special of the day (that super-delicious caramelized apple pork chop), and a chocolate martini (crafted deliciously by George, co-owner). Both George and Judy were so fantastic to interact with, even going so far as to introduce me to the cooks, and other patrons!  I even left with a bag of grapefruits to take to my co-workers tomorrow and A HUG!  Which is a big deal if you know me, because I'm a hugger!  I've had some pretty awesome customer service in my day, but I can't think of a time or place when I have ever felt so welcome at an establishment I've never been to!  It's clear that the people at Feeney's take pride in their work and I can't wait to go back! From the menu to the staff, Feeney's is a breath of fresh air!  I would recommend this restaurant to ANYONE!"}
{"text":"If you have not been to Feeneys restaurant on 12th street in Phoenix, you have not had the best meal in Phoenix. It may not look outstanding from the outside, however, order the pork osso buco,  prine rib, rack of ribs, or pasta Bolognese or the fried ice cream and you'll love it all.  100s of beers as well. The customer service is above and beyond. I don't know how anyone rated this restaurant lower than a 5 star. Thanks to all the folks there, particularly George. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"We had our retirement dinner for our father here the other night. We were a party of seven and had a private room of the main dinning room that was perfect for out little celebration. We had checked in with yelp and got one of their free potato skin appetizers as well as an order of calamari and escargot. All were delicious and perfectly prepared escargot and calamari. We have done our research on yelp and wanted to try the prime rib and the liver and onions a couple of their specialties. Our water glasses were never empty the staff was very attentive.  I highly recommend this place if you're tired of the chain and Fox concept nonsense. This should be a local staple if you live in this area. For a party of 73 bottles of wine three appetizers seven dinners and desserts are total bill was 230.00. Wow great vale for excellent service and food!!!!"}
{"text":"First some of my background....20+ years as a waitress, hostess, catering captain, catering business owner.    We arrived at 5 pm on 12/31.  The first words out of the hostess/owner's mouth were \"do you have a reservation?\"  Not a good sign.  I snuck a peek at the reservation book, and there were a handful before 6 pm but no more.  I said that no, we thought we were safe coming in at 5.  She gave us the stink-eye and  proceeded to make a big deal about \"finding\" a table.  This while there were maybe 2 tables occupied in the whole place.  We should have taken the opportunity to say \"thank you very much\" and turned around and walked away, but we did not...having been wanting to try this place for a long time.  We sat and were waited on by the hostess herself.  Cordial enough, but no offering of a wine list or anything.  Clearly getting the bum's rush from the beginning.  We opted for a glass each of the house wine since no other options were given (generally we would order a bottle).  The wine was horrible, watered down and flavorless.  We ordered prime rib (Traditional cut) for $22 each.  Salad bar was small but good and fresh.  Meals were timed quickly after the salad was cleared.  Prime rib was decent, mine was not medium rare but more medium, barely room temp.  I had the steamed veggies which were done fine...husband had baked potato.  We were quickly offered coffee which we refused...at this point we couldn't get out of there quickly enough.    While the food was decent and the prices were reasonable, it was the initial treatment and the feeling of needing to free up the table that will keep us from ever returning.  Next time we will stay and have dinner at Dick's Hideaway where we had cocktails before venturing into Feeney's."}
{"text":"So, tonight we went to Feeny's. This is usually a great place, but lately they have fallen down on the job.   It's not the food, which is great, but the bar.  Exorbitant drink prices.  This is Central Phoenix, not Scottsdale. Short pours and watery drinks are not what I expect.  And a cocktail waitress who doesn't listen.  Very disappointing.   It will be a while before we go back."}
{"text":"Good food and EXCELLENT service.  There aren't many places like this left.  They welcome you into the restaurant like it's their home.  Everyone's seems to be family - customers and employees alike.  This place should be in a Best of Phoenix list."}
{"text":"Before we even walked in we were greeted warmly and then seated right away. The fish tacos we had were delicious definitely the best I've had in arizona. They had a salad bar which had various toppings and tasted great. They had a great selection of beer (according to my boyfriend who is a craft beer enthusiast) and a wine list along with a full bar. All of the waiters and waitresses were extremely friendly and provided excellent customer service. The atmosphere was very welcoming.  I gave this place 5 stars because the food was delicious,the customer service was fantastic, and the atmosphere made you feel right at home. Great for a date night. Definitely going back again."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Feeney's more stars.   I stopped there tonight to meet for dinner, getting there earlier than my boyfriend I waited at the bar. Within 10 minutes I was having a conversation with the owner Judy, the bartender George and several of the other bar patrons. It felt like somewhere I'd been 100 times before with how friendly everyone was.   George then was our server when my boyfriend arrived. He, the hostess and even the bus boy were prompt and happy to help with whatever we needed.   The food was awesome, to solidify this being our new favorite spot. We got the New York strip steak and prime rib, both cooked to perfection.   I can't say enough great things about every part of our experience and look forward to seeing Judy, George and the gang again soon!"}
{"text":"Warning: if you dine once at Feenye's, you'll be addicted, and you'll probably be writing a review for a 12-step rehab program that will get you out of the undeniable allure that this Restaurant/Bar has to offer. Having that said, yeah...it IS worth it!  Let me take you through this cozy satisfying experience by starting off with the appetizers that we tried; first few times we went there we were pretty much obsessed with the SAGANAKI, which is a flaming Greek Kefalograviera cheese served with fresh pita bread. We also tried, TENDERLOIN TOAST which is a to die for slice of meat lover's heaven on herbed cheese on garlic crostini. And, my go to fav' now is--GREEK BRUSCETTA which includes feta cheese, kalamata olives, tomato on fresh pita bread, with a glass of pinot noir, you can't do no wrong!   If that didn't tickle your fancy, the salad bar will. Fully loaded with your favorite greens and then some.   After we've been fully appetizerized, we also had a few of their main dishes that were defiantly worth trying twice! Last time we were there I had the CHICKEN PICATTA with lemon caper sauce and my husband had the PAN SEARED TROUT almondine. On another occasion I had the LAMB CHOPS with Greek seasoning and my husband had the GRILLED SALMON Greek style. Needless to say...DAYMN that was some good eats!  Now here's how you KNOW...you just know, that you're in for a night of class A eating, and it is when you're too full to move, but you'll say \"yeah...I will take a look at the desserts menu\". We had a slice of the ice cream cake that must not be named! Oh yes, it was that intense...chocolate, Oreo, and ice cream...'nough said.  If you're not sold by now, hit their bar with your friends...according to my husband and his friends, you CAN'T leave, thanks to the owner, George, who makes Feenye's Restaurant and Bar an experience that you'd want to revisit again and again."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and waited an hour to get our food  (filet, prime rib, Oscar tournedos) which when it finally came out was mediocre at best. If your customers are waiting an hour for their food because you've got a party of 20 ahead of them - at least offer them a drink or appetizer on the house. Service was friendly and attentive otherwise. Bud light pitchers are a bargain at $3.50 even if they are \"mini pitchers\"."}
{"text":"We just found this place and WOW!! The food was perfect, the staff was ever so helpful and we met some of the regulars who made us feel like we belonged.  I will be back again,"}
{"text":"Bees knees Beef Wellington! My husband and I came here not knowing what to expect and we were blown away! Not only was the beef Wellington the most amazing dish ever, the staff was also wonderful! They treated us with such gratitude and we were just as grateful for their service! We came specifically for the beef Wellington on the menu, but the rest of the menu sounded amazing as well. We will definitely be here for dinner again!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant, the food was priced expensive, $26-$48! I don't mind paying for that if the food is that great, this was not... The mashed potatoes were a ball with this dark brn stuff that had chunks (who serves burned gravy?!). I live in the neighborhood and was very disappointed, not returning..."}
{"text":"It's burger Monday! This place has the best salad bar prepared fresh everyday and uses the freshest high quality meats. A true central phoenix landmark that caters to generations of loyal customers. Amazing and friendly staff and owner make it feel like cheers... where everyone knows your name!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, but the food & service were even better!!! The pork osso bucco was incredible!!!"}
{"text":"Went with friend, twice now. Once just for a drink at the bar, and next for dinner.   We both enjoyed our meals and the service was good, but overall, i felt like it was a place out of the 70's (not necessarily bad).  However, they were still catering to the demographic that was in their 30s and 40s during the 1970's.  (Hope you could follow all those numbers!!)   What I mean by that is:  the food selection, salad bar, decor, and overall ambiance was made for my dad or grandfather and hasn't updated for four decades.   E.G.: my dad LOVES Liver-n-Onions, and Feeney's is famous for it.   I would recommend Feeney's to people at least 60  (or wiser) who are looking to have that feel of Phoenix fine dining in the 1960s or 70s.  Any younger than that, and, well.... I think it's hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"Great meal we had the prime rib and salmon, everything was excellent.  The service was spot on and appreciated."}
{"text":"Visited Feeney's for the first time last night. My first thought was that the inside is much more interesting than the outside. The outside in a fairly nondescript building on 12th St. The inside is more of a retro-throwback to an old school steak house.   We started with escargot and potato skins (the skins were a freebie via Yelp check-in). Both were good, but neither was great. For dinner, my wife had Pork Osso Bucco and I had the Beef Wellington with a Twice Baked Potato. The Osso Bucco was very big portion of shank served on top of mashed potatoes. It was well prepared and tasty. The Beef Wellington was very good as well. A petite filet wrapped in pastry dough and covered with mushroom sauce. Twice baked potato was good as well (quite large actually..)  Overall, our experience was good. The one negative, perhaps a pet peeve of mine, was walking by the outdoor patio to enter and patio is full up with people smoking. I would prefer not to walk through a wall of smoke to enter.   N*joy..."}
{"text":"AWESOME steakhouse, and coming from me that is quite a compliment.  I don't order prime rib out because so many places it just isn't that good, and I never order steaks out because I know how to grill them awesome at home. BUT I would gladly order either at Feeneys! Matter of fact, they are my gold standard for prime rib!  Super friendly service, comfortable but very nice ambiance, nice neighborly bar area, and an awesome salad bar. Lots of great specials, I think it is Tuesdays that you can get their angus burger for $5.   Best beef spot in town, great place to impress a date!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing staff! Food was delicious, especially the beef wellington. Our glasses were full the entire time. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Feeney's is one of my favorite restaurants.  The back room is always quiet, the service is always excellent and the food is very consistently superb.  Prices are very reasonable, especially their specials.    Monday nights are so good in all departments that I'm almost a regular with my family and friends.  Try it, you'll like it a lot."}
{"text":"We came here tonight for my birthday dinner, it was our first time coming here. We shared the prime rib and ribs, both were excellent. The service was outstanding, they are all very friendly and attentive. I even got a hug from Judy who is really nice! They surprised me with a complimentary slice of their delicious ice cream cake. We will definitely be back, it's a great place. We've driven by this place for years, I'm so glad we decided to try it. You should too.  FYI- I NEVER leave reviews, so this is really saying something."}
{"text":"Sirloin was amazing. Salad bar is great. I'm updating my review to 5 stars because the service at our last visit was top notch. Our friends had the rib eye and said it was amazing. The salad bar is always fresh and the ranch dressing is good. If you want a family friendly steak house this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"WeJust found this place a my colleagues and I were looking for a local steakhouse. We had no idea how amazing it was going to be! Not only was the staff amazingly friendly but the food was by far the best we could have asked for. ! The regulars even make a point to come and talk to you! I'm traveling to Phoenix again I definitely want to come back here!  We had the Prime Rib and it more than lived up to the hype!  Wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Being from Wisconsin we struggle trying to find an awesome Prime Rib in an unpretentious atmosphere. Feeny's hit the mark! Great food and friendly staff! Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times.  First time they were incredibly nice and apologized for our food being out so slow (it wasn't) and they offered us free drinks from the bar.  Food was awesome along with the service.  Second time was on Christmas Eve.  Great service, free valet parking, and awesome food.  Steaks are always good to our liking (medium rare and medium well).  Salad bar is pretty good and the appetizers we've tried are good.  The people who have greeted us each time (I can only assume they're the owners) are so grateful and happy you're there.  We've never felt so welcome at a restaurant and they're so nice.  A bit on the \"pricey\" side for dinner...but it's a steak house.  Given that, it's an amazing price for the quantity of food, quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Simply delicious!  Fabulous service!  The Best Food!  It is our family favorite!  We love Feeny's!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We brought a friend for his b-day and he loved it. The service is great and the cuts of steak were amazing as were appetizers and salad bar. The baked potatoes, fried zucchini and potatoes skins should be tried. Oh and the onion rings looked good too. The desserts were great! I was hoping for Creme Brûlée but they were out so now I'm hooked on the mud pie which is really really good! You won't regret eating here. It's a cute place with nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Every two weeks we visit from California.  I'm glad we finally decided to take the chance and visit Feeney's.  The food:  Both my wife and I ordered the Top Sirloin. Beyond my expectations the steak was extra thick and cooked perfectly. Ask your server to add extra cracked peppercorns (you'll thank me later). The side was a loaded baked potato included with the entree, DELICIOUS.  Atmosphere: The setting is low light at wooden tables. If you make a trip to the salad bar you can watch the chef cook your steak right in front of you which is pretty neat. The noise level is about a 5 out of 10 which is pretty good considering Feeney's has a full bar inside as well.   The service: We were greeted at the door and seated immediately. Our waiter George  Was on the money! Never left us waiting and kept my glass full (coldest 805 on tap).  Bottom Line:  If you've been wanting to take the shot...DO IT!"}
{"text":"Man I wish I would have found this place sooner I've drove by here many times and thought it was just some hole-in-the-wall bar so I never stopped in please don't make the mistake that I did stopping here get their delicious prime rib I always thought that Houston has the best prime rib but not anymore I think it's the crust that they have on it and there's not a lot of fat so you can enjoy pretty much the whole thing there  au ju is pretty damn good too taste just like that pan drippings now watch out for their horseradish pretty strong stuff I cut mine with sour cream how much better another definite must is there potato skins crispy and cheesy what else is there had that Ace Pineapple Cider very good it tastes like that hard pineapple candy another thing is their salad bar comes with any meal very good also finished off the meal with a creme brulee it was good I had a lemon taste to it not traditional creme brulee but very good at that Judy the bartender was great made you feel at home and like you belong there like the other regulars that go there definitely will be back very soon"}
{"text":"Maria was so approachable and friendly.  Our group ordered the calamari , prime rib and a wonderful mud pie for dessert.  Great atmosphere and good food"}
{"text":"Went for dinner the other night. Had the largest shrimp I have ever seen in the shrimp cocktail!  They make their own sauce which will clear your sinuses.   Delicious burger and fish and chips. We both agreed we need to order the fries crispy next time so they aren't soggy.   Nice salad bar.   Have heard about their brunch being very good so will try that next.   Parking lot is tight so careful parking.  Could have done without having to walk through smokers sitting outside the door."}
{"text":"Just had the worst prime rib I have ever tried. Went for dinner at 7 with my gf. There where a lot of people enjoying dinner. Service was pleasant . Ordered the prime rib with veggies and salad bar. Prime rib looked properly served as med rare. I tried it by its self then with the horseradish and Au jus . The meat Didn't have the taste or texture I find appealing . Bottom of the meat had a slimy appearance that resembled bad meat . Maybe I just caught em on a bad night. Needless to say it was a 60$ donation. I won't be back"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner one night because there are always cars in the parking lot and I live close enough to walk. The atmosphere was nice. It's old school yet romantic and laid back.  The salad bar is just a salad bar. There is nothing that makes it a great salad bar but I do like salad so I did eat some!   I ordered the prime rib with mashed potatoes. The prime rib was very good. There was tons of fat on my piece but that's pretty normal.  The potatoes were great.  I was shocked because you can tell they are made in house and so many places now used instant stuff.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's a little overpriced for the area."}
{"text":"Saturday night at Feeney's.  Ordered the Shepard's Pie and Chicken Marsala.  Dinners come with either unlimited salad bar or soup.  We chose the salad.  About 10 items including lettuce ( not the spring mix or anything like it), tomatoes, cukes, onion, cheese, cottage cheese, pepperocini peppers, bacon bits, etc were included.   We chose from 3 salad dressings and I liked the greek dressing.  They offer cold metal plates which keep the salad cold.  The shepard's pie was large and freshly made.  Since shepard's pie is an irish dish I thought I would be made true to Irish form.  Instead,  the meat was cooked Greek style with cinnamon and cloves in it.  It made me like it a lot less than I would without these added items.  Don't like cinnamon in meat.  I then realized (duh) that this is a greek restaurant or at least the cook is.   This is also one of those restaurants who use brown sauce on almost everything.  Even my shepard's pie had brown gravy on.  Ok.  I guess it doesn't hurt.  But when hubby's chicken marsala came with the same brown gravy, he didn't like it much.  What he disliked was that it was just an un-breaded, under-seasoned chicken cutlet, plated, and then topped with brown gravy with marsala wine in it.  This is not the way to make chicken marsala.  The chicken cutlet has to be partially sauteed in light olive oil and then transferred to a pan of marsala wine sauce and allowed to finish cooking there. He said that while the cutlet was not overcooked, once you cut into it, it had no taste.  So if given the opportunity, he would not order that dish again.  The service is very good and attentive at Feeney's.  So if you like a decent salad bar and not overly expensive dishes,  Feeney's will make you happy."}
{"text":"Not so good.  Pricey for what I got.  Salad bar was a bonus, not sure if it justified."}
{"text":"Read a number of good reviews here on this establishment. Last night, my friend and I had a hankering for prime rib so we decided to try Feeney's.  We arrived and were seated promptly. Drink orders were taken. Iced tea only (my friend has been on the wagon over 25 years!!). Small glass, but was constantly refilled. Ordering was no problem. My friend ordered the small cut of prime rib (approx 10 oz) and a baked potato w sour cream and chives. I ordered the \"Feeney's Cut\" (the largest, approx 24 oz) of prime rib with rice pilaf. Dessert was fried ice cream. There is complimentary salad bar. Warm rye and pumpernickel breads and butter come with the dinners.   Maybe the kitchen was having an off night. Maybe the vendor supplied substandard beef. Maybe the refrigeration was screwed up. I don't know. Let's start with the salad bar. All the usual fare: mixed iceberg lettuce, carrots, 3 bean salad, cottage cheese, cici beans, bacon bits, red onions, croutons, etc. There were four kinds of salad dressings, including ranch, russian and creamy italian. The ingredients were fresh, especially the lettuce. However, the salad bar itself was mildly cool, not cold. Otherwise the salad bar, in my experience, is nothing special.  The prime rib orders arrived as we ordered them: medium rare. Small plastic cups of horseradish sauce and au jus were on the plates. My rice pilaf was starchy and stuck together. My friend's baked potato was underdone. After trimming off 20% of the meat because one end was all fat and gristle, both orders were a tad dry. There was no rub on the exterior; no salt, no cracked peppercorns, nothing. The prime rib is really nondescript. The fried ice cream dessert was well executed.  The service was good. The iced tea server (that's all he does, apparently) was working overtime. I'd like to give this restaurant 2.5 stars because I find nothing about this restaurant particularly outstanding. They served us perfectly average fare."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat at feeneys all the time. We love their fresh salad bar, the warm hugs from Maria and the funny jokes from Judy. Every time we go there we leave satisfied and happy. We would go there even if they served rocks for food the love we get from the owners is amazing all on its own. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to experience true fine dinning."}
{"text":"First time here. The owner is super sweet. She waited our table.  Salad bar was an excellent perk. Very fresh and kept stocked. The prime rib was delish. Kids loved their burgers. Chicken kabob lacking major flavor but the owner changed it and let us take it home. What a sweetheart. The table next to us shared their enormous slice mud pie slice with the kids. What an awesome neighborhood experience. I would recommend for sure."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! From the owner, to the staff to other diners! My 2nd time here and Judy remembered us from 6 weeks ago! The food is to die for, the prime rib is just that, PRIME! Location also great at 12th St and Maryland. Can't beat this place!! We'll be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"We wanted Prime Rib for our wedding anniversary dinner so I googled \"Best Prime Rib in Phoenix\" and Feeney's was on the Top 10.  It was amazing!! Appetizer, 2-10 oz. Prime Rib dinners & a good bottle of red wine for under $100 (w/o tip).  WE had a reservation but arrived early...they were BUSY but they got us a table right away.  Salad bar is amazing (great Ranch).  Seems to be a popular local place...the waitresses were hugging their customers...that's always a good sign!!  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food best service ever! Oh my the prime rib I have left overs for tomorrow! I recommend the twice baked potato! Treated just like family will be back!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong! Service is ALWAYS friendly. My favorite is Monday night burger special. Burger is cooked to perfection, flavorful and juicy! The salad bar is a nice change and always stocked and clean. The staff is always friendly, talkative and gives you that family feeling of you just walked in to your favorite aunt's house.  My go to place for nights when I don't feel like cooking or driving, as the walk is nice as well."}
{"text":"Great great great!!! Awesome beef Wellington and prime rib. They have great specials if you do not want to spend a lot of money. The service is phenomenal and the atmosphere is perfect. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great Monday special (cheeseburger & fries). Customer service always good. Owner even checks in with patrons."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! We all ate excellent food (salad bar, soup, chicken marsala, lamb chops, chili, prime rib and delicious sweet-potato fries!) and were treated so nicely by Maria and taken care of so promptly by Sandy and Nester. Maria's son, John, cooks beautifully in the kitchen. Great food and ambiance...don't pass it up!"}
{"text":"Woah. Not often I get treated as more than just a regular dude. I usually don't mind that, because I'm as regular as dudes can get, but Feeney's treated me like a king. Or sultan. Sultan sounds better.   The servers are fun and they clowned with each other. I like people who love what they do. We ordered the Saganaki as an appetizer, which is this plate of awesome melty cheese you eat with pita bread. That was the best thing I have ever eaten. Then the waitress comes out and she all \"Hey do you guys want a bottle of wine on the house?\" Well, hell yes we would. And so there we were, full bottle of a delicious red blend, 8oz steaks and a delicious appetizer in our bellies.   Might not sound like much, but Feeney's nailed it with me and my girlfriend. You guys have indeed earned another pair of regulars."}
{"text":"Very good Prime Rib & Beef Wellington free potato skins salad bar biggest twice baked potato on the planet yum."}
{"text":"The best way to describe this place is a dive bar. Incense, burning in the bathrooms, wafts throughout the place.   Shrimp cocktail with nary a hint of horseradish (seemed almost like a tomato sauce), cold baked potato and creme brûlée that, well tasted like the burnt parts of a roasted marshmallow.   The prime ribs was good and the wait staff was awesome though.   All and all I can't see how this place gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"The people were incredibly friendly all the way down to the cooks. Food was good, but not great for the price point. The kids loved the French fries. We had the prime rib and teriyaki top sirloin, both medium rare. Ended up sharing the sirloin as it was much better out of the two. We also enjoyed the salad bar."}
{"text":"Great old school hidden gem to try in Phoenix. Okay, let me be clear - this is not ruth chris, flemings, or any other upscale steakhouse. This is old school 1960's-1970's steakhouse that looks its age with the vintage salad bar in front of an open kitchen to boot. Yes, it needs up grades, fresh carpet, whatever. Still, the steaks we had were great!  First off, make a reservation - the place was packed on Saturday night. The owners are there to great you once inside and as we waited for our table guided us to the bar for a cocktail. Drinks from the bar were strong and wine was a large pour. After a 10 minute wait we were seated.  The menu is not too big but is mostly meat heavy with some greek dishes peppered in as well. We opted for the ribeye and the prime rib both with twice baked potato (upcharge but worth it!) and salad bar. Salad bar was good, not too big but, at a steakhouse all I care about is how good the meat is so...  Steaks arrive and the ribeye is marbled a little more than I would hope but, very tender and juicy - twice baked potato was crazy big - like a small nerf football! The absolute star of the night was the prime rib - awesome. Cut was perfectly cooked and crust was spiced just right.   Overall, service was good, the owners were friendly, funny and made us feel like we were visiting their house for dinner. Place had all types of people from regulars, families, couples, suits, etc. It was a very causal atmosphere. FYI - parking can be a challenge too. So yes, the ribeye was good but, I will come back for that prime rib! I've read other reviews and the prime rib wasn't that good - on our night they nailed it!   Cool spot to check out at least once if you live in the valley."}
{"text":"Awesome family run business !  Super tasty salad bar. A really nice variety of entrees, and daily specials as well."}
{"text":"A old phoenix institution.  At one time this place was known as the cork and Cleaver.  Food is excellent, I had the Philly Cheese Steak.  I have not had one this good since I left the East Coast when i was there for school.  Great place to have some beers with friends and watch sports."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place to us and we decided to go and check it out.   It was Monday when we went and they their Monday special was $5 burger. We decided to start there for the first visit.   Our server was super friendly. We told him it was our first time here and he made sure to give us all needed information. We got the same treatment from him as if we ordered the most expensive item on the list. That is what I call great service.   Our food arrived and I must say, we were both really happy. I would of paid full price for that burger as well.   On the end our server came with the biggest piece of an ice-cream cake I have seen. It was on the house for us to share. How nice was that?   If you go, I can't promise you free ice cream cake, but I can promise great service, great food, great ambiance....You need more?   Thank you Feeney, we will see you again soon!"}
{"text":"I am pretty dissappointed with this place.    I used to think it was a great spot.  But I met a friend here on a Sunday.   Had some iced tea. Did not get one refill and we were there for an hour and a half ! But we we're charged still for two iced teas.  Six bux!!!! I was a regular there.  But I won't be after that.  Terrible customer service.  I'll find a better place to take people to. Very bad customer service.   Not a place I'll be introducing to anyone ever again."}
{"text":"What a find!  We dropped in for a late lunch and George took care of us. The atmosphere reminded me of a better version of Monti's steakhouse in Tempe with rustic brick walls and al fresco scenic murals in each room  The food was divine. I ordered the London broil in a sweeter mushroom sauce and my spouse had the French Dip.  The quality of meat was top notch and we both practically licked our plates towards the end. If my stomach could have handled it, I would have ordered seconds.  This place is located just south of Maryland on 12th Street with simple access and plenty of parking.  We will no doubt be back again.  Our service was excellent as well, but oh wow the food!!"}
{"text":"Welcome to 1971. This place has been stuck in a time warp for the last 45 years. That being said, they know how to cook proteins. I had the Osso Buco and it was done perfectly...hot all the way through and tender as can be smothered in brown mushroom gravy. Do not go here if you are looking for trendy gastropub fare with new fangled dishes and culinary creativity. Go here if you want and old style quiet meal with friendly service. There are lots of upscale menu items like beef wellington and lobster. The salad bar is weak at best. The imitation bacon bits are a real downer. It would be easy not to like this place, but they can cook good old style food. I am conflicted and don't really know how to rate a place that doesn't really fit into any recognizable category of restaurant. This place is just different. Try it and see if it works for you. Maybe, maybe not....."}
{"text":"I am not sure how they stay in business? oh wait their prices and low quality food is the answer to that question. Low quality, I am not sure what has happened to this place.. the last 4 times I ate here the meal has gotten smaller and the quality lacking. I took some friends for dinner and they asked that we not go back there again. The salad bar was dirty, the martini's were low quality. I could over look all that, but the place needs cleaned and bar needs remove the Tavern element. A few of the patrons were so drunk and loud, the manager just walked past as one of them almost feel off the stool. I will give it another try, but none of my friends are willing to go back there to eat... ( my liver and onions were Great!)."}
{"text":"We went back there again about a week ago.   The same things that appealed to me the first time annoyed me the second time.   Why valet parking? Its like having valet parking at a Lone Star. It doesn't make sense.   The hostess is...weird. The atmosphere is odd. Why is the kitchen attached to the salad bar?   Why the stupid cartoon building wall paper?   The steak with tender but tasteless.   Basically, it was a  bunch of blue collar workers who make less money than me acting like they were better than me.   Lame."}
{"text":"A friend, a big fan of prime rib, had never been here and wanted to try their specialty. Since I wanted to try their prime rib also, we met up here for dinner last night. My friend arrived ahead of me and told me that he was pleasantly surprised to be greeted as warmly as if he were a long time regular, even though this was his first time in this restaurant. For our entree, we ordered the same thing - prime rib, medium rare, with baked potato. I also got the salad bar while he got soup, and also a creme brulee for dessert. Everything was delicious, especially the prime rib - it was downright spectacular. It was a great way to cap the year off, and my friend says he's so glad he finally tried the place; he now has a new favorite for the new year."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Steakhouse and Good salad bar.the owners Maria and her son George are wonderful people who treat you right."}
{"text":"Wow! Excellent delmonico sirloin!!!!   Great beer list! Great service! The owners are welcome and inviting and accommodated special requests with a smile.  What great people serving great food. Thank you"}
{"text":"This is a real fun hidewaway in Phoenix.  You have to put it on your list and stop in now and then.  The staff and peeps there are really friendly and accommodating.  The food is also very good (unbeatable salad bar) and some pretty good steaks.  Had the ribs but did not care much for it.  Fun bar area as well if you go on a monday-thursday when they are not crowded (bar only holds about 10-12 or so).  Anyway, mark it in your books and we'll see you there!!"}
{"text":"Searched yelp for a Father's Day prime rib treat and found this spot and decided to give it a chance . Upon walking to the salad bar I noticed an open grill that had some sausages searing and putting out a pleasant Aroma . I felt I had made a good choice ..The Prime rib was on point along with the baked potato and salad . I will definitely be back to explore some more dishes ."}
{"text":"Hello, Phoenix history! This was the second location of the Cork N' Cleaver chain. Back when there was a Cork N' Cleaver chain. And not much has changed since.  In my mid 20's I lived around the corner and was in quite often. Never had a bad meal. Granted - I never had a GREAT meal - but it was never bad.  I moved away - then I moved back. While I am certainly not a regular - some of the specials are just too hard to pass by. Monday is CenPho is cheap burger night. $4 for burger and fries at Feeney's and Maizies, $5 at Vig and Vig Uptown. My mom's husband is not a big fan of Maizie's decor, so we have been frequenting Vig Uptown. I talked them into Feeney's last week - and it was a great trip down memory lane. Each of us went for the $4 burger special, and we each elected to add on the salad bar for $2.50.  Nothing exceptional - it was a standard, good quality burger. Nothing flashy or showy - nothing you wouldn't have seen when they opened this location in 1965. And it still works. Well.   Specials other nights of the week include fish & chips, liver and onions, fried chicken, salisbury steak and half rack of ribs - all for $10 each, and all including the salad bar.  Tough to beat that!  In this town, it's not easy to keep an independently owned restaurant open. And keeping one open almost 50 years? Well, I think we can all count on one hand how many places have made that happen.   The food is solid, if not spectacular, the service is always decent, the prices are fair and the portions are good - glad to have Feeney's in my area - it makes me feel like I am part of this town's history - and lets me step back in time a bit.  The advantage of not having updated is when you get inside, it's easy to forget the outside world. You're in a little time warp with a full bar, well executed food and none of the worries of the real world of 2012."}
{"text":"Despite Nikki Jo M's negative review I think its important to experience feeny's for YOURSELF. I have never given nor heard a poor recommendation when it comes to this place. You will find this establishment has a lot of character to offer which is largly in part why they have so many returning customers. It is true the staff and their clientele have often been compared to the environment of the popular show Cheers because indeed everyone inside is very familiar with one another making for a very comfortable environment. Doesn't matter if its your 100th time or 1st time in Feeny's. For this reason it is always a good time here; whether you're meeting for drinks or dinner. Everyone inside is extremely welcoming and gracious, nothing but good people.   If the people nor the atmosphere is satisfying enough, the food alone makes up for any dissatisfaction. The menu has a wide variety of items including classics as well as new dishes, all delicious! They are known for their salad bar along with their high quality meats, including some of the best prime rib in central Phoenix.   I've been frequenting Feenys for a few months now and will continue to do so as the food along with the people continue to make for a pleasurable experience.   I highly recommend Feeny's to people of all ages and backgrounds."}
{"text":"Great service, great ambiance.  LOVED the low arches and brick walls inside.  BUT Prime rib was barely warm, and broccoli was even cooler.  The bernaise sauce they brought was a bit curdled.  They were busy, but not swamped.  Maybe it was an off night."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time this past Monday, we wanted something simple & not too far from home so based on the reviews we ended up here. As you pull up to park you get the feeling it's a quaint little restaurant, nothing fancy but a nice little neighborhood spot. Well as you walk in it's as if you've just stepped back into time about forty years, mind you the sign says established 1975....... well I think that's the one & only time they've ever decorated this restaurant! We were greeted by I believe the owner who graciously sat us in one of the mini dining rooms, you see there's I believe 5 or 6 mini dining rooms that have about 5 tables in each except for the dining room in back which was larger. There was a bar that had about 15 bar stools & that had actually more customers then the restaurant itself but we got the feeling that most everyone in the restaurant had been regulars for many years therefore we decided we'd give them a try. We decided to start with a glass of Chardonnay for myself & a Stella draft for my hubby, then we were given some complimentary dinner rolls with some prepackaged pats of butter... the rolls were the kind you'd get out of the grocery store.... very basic. We chose to start with the calamari, my hubby chose the top sirloin with shoestring fries & salad bar for his entree, I chose to have the chicken Marsala with a baked potato & homemade chicken corn chowder. The calamari came out which at first glance looked just right & you had two sauces to choose from either cocktail or marinara. The calamari was actually good at first bite & loved that they included the tentacles but the marinara was actually too sweet, also once we got to the end of the calamari we noticed them sitting in a pool of grease because they were not drained long enough..... ended up not taking home the leftover calamari. Then I was served the soup which was actually quite good but very thick & filling, you could definitely tell that it was homemade because the ingredients were nice & fresh. My hubby had the salad bar which was a basic salad bar that has all the typical fixings, one turnoff was the imitation bacon bits...FYI had no idea that they still existed!! Then our entrees came out & my hubby's sirloin that was such a thick cut was a beautiful medium & super moist, he also loved the fries.... it was actually so big that he just couldn't finish his meal. My chicken Marsala was perfectly cooked with the fresh button mushrooms & the sauce was made just right, not too thick & not too runny. The potato was just that a baked potato with some chives but like I said they're definitely stuck in a time warp!! The soup & the entrees were delicious if you want a reasonably priced meal with some good quality meats but SIMPLE, VERY SIMPLE menu that is also kind of stuck in a time warp. It basically brought me back to those childhood memories of where this was the spot your dad would bring the family for a birthday or a special occasion. I'm sure we'll be back when my hubby is in the mood for his carnivore fix but it just won't be our go to spot for a gourmet meal."}
{"text":"Wanted something simple yet fulfilling & I chose to have dinner here tonight.  5 stars for service. Very hands on & friendly. 3.75 stars for overall food. 4.5 stars for value  Trout almondine was HUGE & really delicious. A definite keeper. I would have preferred a little less oil/butter for health reasons.  Prime Rib- great value!   Salad bar- included with meal. Very kitsch, old school feel. Basic; lettuce, onion, cucumber, tomato, olives, macaroni salad, coleslaw, beets   Lettuce a little watery/yet I helped myself to 2 servings.  Free potato skins with check-in on yelp and then he also (I think owner) brought us a chocolate dessert (a little icey) yet we devoured it.   I will definitely return here and get fish again.  Thanks for the awesome hospitality!"}
{"text":"Feeneys is the quintessential neighborhood gem spot that only the locals know about. They create a vibe of family and friendliness to ALL PATRONS who enter their door. A lot of restaurants in valley SHOULD go here and see what REAL CUSTOMER service looks like.   That paragraph rant and I haven't even gotten to the best part. The FOOD. From the old school salad bar to their legendary prime rib; Feeney's get it RIGHT. Not to mention it one of the few surviving places that still serves up properly cooked Liver & Onions (my wifes favorite), Beef Wellington, and Lamb Chops."}
{"text":"Hated it!!!  I had a pasta dish and had to pay an extra $4 bucks for 2 tiny shrimp.  My husband had a burger, which I swear would have been on the kids menu anywhere else, because it was so tiny.  Our server had absolutely no personality at all.  Would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"I LOVE Feeney's!  Stopped in with a friend a few years ago and have been coming back ever since.  It's a family run establishment that makes you feel as if you are a part of their family!  They ALWAYS take care of you here!  So special!  Thank you, Feeney's!"}
{"text":"When you walk into this place it reminds me of the movie Good Fellas. My brother turned me onto this place and it is fantastic. Family owned and operated. Just the nicest group of people. And the food, although not all heart smart from what I could see at our table, was quite delish!"}
{"text":"Nice non- commercialized dinner restaurant for good steaks and a variety of good food.  Best part is the family atmosphere with the nice waiters/waitresses.  That and of course the salad bar is amazing.  Great place for a date or to hang out in the small bar for a drink.  There is also a patio area which seems to be run by the locals/regulars that are always very friendly.  Food is reasonable priced with nothing crazy or out of the ordinary.  I plan to keep on coming back and exploring all the unique menu items"}
{"text":"This is obviously a family owned joint, and it shows. Their passion for their restaurant is evident. They were packed, and they still treated my wife and I like we were one of only a few customers. They were courteous and complimentary throughout the entire meal. The menu is very plain, but they do it right. All of the ingredients in the salad bar tasted fresh, and awesome. The California Burger is very simple, and they made it taste extraordinary. My wife loved the prime rib, saying it tasted \"How beef should\". They had an awesome beer menu, as well. Lots of imports and craft brews.  I will be frequenting this restaurant from now on."}
{"text":"Great staff,  food could use a bit of help.  Prime rib was traditional,  but I'm a prime rib snob.  Potatoes tasted like over boiled.  Salad bar needs some help."}
{"text":"Fun, quirky place for a drink and bar food. Great service too."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go any day of the week! Tonight I had a tasty juicy burger with sweet potato fries. I usually add the salad bar because it's always fresh from the garden fresh.  If you want great food at a family owned business this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We love this place.........we come here especially for the Prime Rib, and the awesome salad bar - who else has this anymore??!!  Always amazing, always delicious........best little late-night gem we've found in a long while."}
{"text":"Man!!! I LOVE Yelp!!!!  I was craving for a nice juicy rib eye and found Feeney's through Yelp.  I got there on a Wednesday night around 6pm and it wasn't too crowded so I was able to get a table right away.  It looks like this restaurant also has some Greek items.  For example they serve Saganaki (Flaming cheese with pita bread), if I was with another person, I would totally order it because I love this dish. They also serve Hummus and Pasta Mykonos (linguini with feta cheese, chopped tomatoes and chives in a garlic butter sauce).    I was very tempted to order the Greek items but I came here for the Prime Rib.  So I ordered the following: Ace Pineapple Hard Cider ($5.45) - Pineapple Beer.... No need to describe how good was this beer. Potato Skins (Free if you Check In) - Lots of cheese, bacon, sour cream and green onions.  What an awesome combination!!! Feeney's Famous Prime Rib 8oz ($21) - The meat melted in my mouth.  I ordered it medium rare, it was tender, juicy and flavorful.  So much meat for just $21.  I got it with a build your own side salad and baked potato.  They had to wheel me out of the restaurant. LOL :) :)   I can't wait to go back to Feeney's.  My mouth is watering just by writing this review."}
{"text":"This is a local gem! From the outside it doesn't seem like much. However, the owner, employees, & food is awesome. Try the salad bar & make sure you get some potato salad. It's the best potato salad I've ever had. The prime rib is always a good choice too. I love how cozy & comfortable you feel when you're dining here."}
{"text":"From being greeted at the door by the owners to a great dining experience.. This place is a true hidden neighborhood gem. The food is awesome and rarely disappoints. If so they make it right.. This is definitely on my top 10 favorites in the valley."}
{"text":"My new favorite. Stopped in to watch football in the bar and have some dinner with a friend, now I can't get enough.  Prime rib is excellent, Mondays burger special is a huge burger and fries for $5 and the salad bar is fresh and crispy. So far, the food is 5 star. The staff is so great-they make you feel pampered."}
{"text":"Dive bar Local family owned restaurant   Great Greek and steak themes The calamari is fresh and tasty All the plates so far are cooked to perfection  Quick fast service with drink selection  Will continue to come"}
{"text":"Their lemon chicken soup won over my daughter.  The intimate interior welcomes you as you walk in and the food is superb.  I can't believe I drove past this place for 20 years before finally stopping in.  I'll be dropping in more often."}
{"text":"Visited Feeneys last night for the first time and it will definitely not be the last. We were instantly provided seating although the place was packed on a Friday night. Later in the evening it was standing room only in the bar area and people seemed happy enough to enjoy their drinks standing!  The crowd was mixed ranging from young couples,  families with kids,  and older couples / singles.  The sign says established in 1965 and if you're in a mid-century state of mind, this is THE perfect place. Some of the decor is upscale (there are several dining \"areas\") some dated, some kitschy, some is just fun, like the disco ball hanging from the room to the right of the bar.  But this is NOT what makes Feeneys amazing. What sets this restaurant apart from most is the exceptional service. The owner himself is working his tail off making sure everyone is not just taken care of, but 100% satisfied! Even going so far as to provide a non menu item (that evening)for us since it was advertised on Yelp. The salad bar has all the basics you could want but I think the key to this salad bar was quality over quantity. There wasn't a wilted piece of lettuce to be found. Beautiful fresh Romaine with plenty of crisp fresh toppings. Cucumbers, tomatos, carrots etc. I had the prime rib and my husband had the Rib Eye. Both were excellent. My husband ordered his steak Medium rare and it was more on the rare side than medium which is perfect for him but something to keep in mind when ordering. Prime Rib is what they are known for and it lived up to the hype. The staff was exceptional. Not only were they friendly but also extremely accommodating.   Dining here is a bit like going back in time. Back to the time when service and great food was the priority!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm a foodie, so trust me when I say this place is PHENOMENAL! The ambiance is extremely chill and casual, (you can show up in jeans and a t-shirt), the staff is friendly and attentive, and the food is fantastic. I hadn't had prime rib in a long while, and it was worth the wait to eat it at this hidden gem. The meat was garlicky and flavorful, and so prime I didn't need a knife! I've driven passed it at least a hundred times, and I'm so glad I finally tried it. It's the perfect place for a relaxed evening with incredible food! I'll be returning to try the rest of the menu at least once a month. Thank you for a killer night, Feeny's!"}
{"text":"What a cute little place that I never knew existed. I arrived there on Monday night for UYE that Miss Dottsy put together for us. The best part about it was that they had no idea that we were coming. They accommodated us even though we caught them by surprise and we told them there would be at least a group of 15 of us. No problem!! The owners were so personable and the waitress we had OMG. Her name was Linda but I called her \"Bubbles\" because that woman has a very, VERY bubbly personalty and she made it a point to remember all our names all night.   Now their were a few pros and cons.....   Pros  It was Monday night so the burgers were only $4.00. Although I didn't have one of my own, the bite that I did take was delicious and everyone said that they were good and juicy!   The owners were super friendly. They even bought us a round of beer and gave us each a shot of Ouzo! (I had to declined but wow!!! You could smell the Ouzo seeping from our group lol)   Happy hour prices are really great!! You can't go wrong here.   Linda made sure everyone had separate checks without us even asking. Double score for that one.   I was with a great group of yelpers. Definite plus.   Cons  Parking is a little difficult because the parking is small. But hey that just means you have to get there early!   Their was a weird smell upon arriving. From what I understood, thier had been a back up earlier that day that had been fixed but the smell lingered for awhile. It almost made me leave because it was a little overwhelming. As the night progressed, it did air out.   The area we were in, was very nice until it got dark. There was only one light in that area and made it very bright, but only on one side of the table   The food that people ordered (aka the burgers) came out in weird spurts and some had to wait a ridiculously long time for their food. It was weird but not a huge deal. But it is still a con.   Now will I go back? Absolutely. It really is a nicely hidden gem of a place."}
{"text":"I really loved this place it's such a nice environment and I love the soup and the food was so good ! The salad bar is awesome . Maria is so amazing, the service was amazing as well . Very friendly and it is my new favorite place !"}
{"text":"What can I say? Feeny's has quickly become one of our favorite places for dinner.  The hostess, Maria, is a star in every way: wonderful, happy, and its impossible to be a returning guest without a hug! Its just a bonus that she says \"asparagus\" with a Greek accent I find sexy, and my entire table laughs at me every time she says it! The busboy Nestor is usually our personal drink refiller, and a great guy all around.  The salad bar is exactly the same as every 1970s salad bar at the steakhouse your parents dragged you to, complete with GOOD jello!  Steaks are done really well, and its clear the chef cares about his customers. Maria will not hesitate to fix any that isn't perfect in her opinion, too!  The Beef Wellington is a nice treat, as is the Tornado Oscar and other specialties. Definitely try the Osso Bucco and the Greek lamb chops!  Decor isn't a strong point at all - its casual place and nobody cares how your dressed. The food is great and the staff is too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Feeney's for our anniversary dinner and we were not disappointed.   The food: Overall, I think it was great. I ordered the top sirloin and my husband ordered the medallions. He loved his dish! He didn't leave one piece of food behind on his plate. Mine was good except the steak didn't have very much flavor. I'll be honest, it tasted as though they forgot the seasoning altogether. It definitely was a quality piece of meat but lacked the flavor. The mashed potatoes were heaven though. Once I added A-1 sauce to my steak, the dish was fantastic. On top of that you get warm rolls to accompany your food. The salad bar was amazing! I typically don't like eating from salad bars because some people aren't as sanitary as they could be but this one was good. The salad was crisp and cold. The toppings were fresh and it was very clean.  Experience: The owners made us feel like family. They were so pleased to have us there on our special day. They even brought us a slice of the Mud pie with a candle and it was to die for! The owner hugged us and said \"We'll see you soon\". It was almost like they could read our minds. We will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many times and never noticed it!! But per YELP...I found it. Went there a month ago.  Its not what you'd expect. A little dated inside, but the staff is very friendly. (Although, our waiter didn't stop by that much and it took a while to get our order in). Anyway,  I went there for dinner (party of 8) and we got our own little room practically. So it was nice to be able to not shout at anyone (like you do in most crowded restaurants). I ordered fish and it was really good (can't recall which one, sorry--white fish of some sort) And it came with their little salad bar option. (which was nice to be able to go up and get as much as you want). Overall I enjoyed this restaurant and would go back."}
{"text":"This place was so sweet and welcoming. the food was delicious too. it made me feel like i was at my grandmothers or something. we walked in and a gentleman asked where we wanted to sit, instead of telling us. then there was about 2-4 ppl checking on us. they joked with us, were sweet with my kids and talked to them instead of me, which i love because they are ppl that can speak for themselves. ugh i just can't say enough about this place. definitely will visit again next time i'm in phoenix."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in we were greeted and we were treated like family. Outstanding service. The gentleman hosting pulled out my chair for me and pushed it in when we sat down. Our waiter had no problem answering our questions and was very knowledgeable regarding their draft selections. Our meals were phenomenal. As soon as I checked in our waiter noticed and put in for the free potato skins. We were greeted multiple times by different employees and what seemed like the owners themselves. You could tell the restaurant is their pride and joy. Absolutely amazing experience. Wouldn't hesitate to make this restaurant our new go to steakhouse. Worth driving an hour for."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed in the slightest. We sat down fast and had our orders taken. Started with potatoes skins which were beyond cold in the middle and SO greasy. I ordered a burger and my boyfriend ordered the steak and lobster tail. My burger was okay but my boyfriends food... ordered medium rare steak and ended up with a very bloody rare steak which is disgusting. His lobster tail was burnt on the shell and trying to cut through it was like cutting through a thick piece of rubber. Our waitress dropped our food off and is never to be seen again. We waited 20 minutes until we could find a worker to help. We spoke to a gentleman and he said he would get the waitress but it took 10 minutes before we realized we'd be here waiting another 20 minutes for someone to come around so we just left. Poor service and poor quality. Not a place I will recommend"}
{"text":"We just enjoyed our Christmas company party there for the third year in a row. Everyone loved their selection for dinner. For a small place, they handled our service for 18 nicely. Thanks to all!"}
{"text":"Feeney's is a tradition in my family...It is my mom's favorite place to grab a bite. Let chomp down and Opa Opa Opa at Feeneys..  ~The Good~ Service. Hooo boy, the service. As soon as you walk in its like your family is welcoming you in. I am not a big \"don't touch me bro\" kinda guy, but the hostess (and I presume owner) is a sweetheart. She took me by the shoulder, made me feel amazing and took me to my table. I had a bunch of flowers for my mother and she made sure I got a big pitcher of water to dunk them in. I did not ask but she was persistent I needed the pitcher. Now its one thing if the service is great, but its another if they provide smiles but crap food...not here.  I got the Pan Fried trout in Lemon Caper Sauce...out of this world. I rarely get fried foods, but it wasn't drenched in oil. The sauce was a bit salty adding the capers in, and really meshed well with the trout. I will try my damnedest to replicate that recipe now. I love trout, and boy did they hit a home run. The salad bar which is attached with almost all meals here also hit the spot and was delicious. Happy hour was available, with almost all drinks being 3 bucks, including wine and well drinks. I got some Cabernet, which tasted about right, not bad, not amazing, just right for the dinner I had.   As for the ambiance and mood, I love it. Quiet and comfy, the lights are perennially dimmed, creating a cozy atmosphere. The staff who are quick to refill drinks and always helpful keep the ambiance rolling strong. I also like the slight hints towards Greece on both their menu and on the murals inside. Very much an independently owned restaurant vibe, which as you know well I really really dig.  Finally, their menu is eclectic, especially seafood. They have 4 seperate fishes on their main menu at any time: Pike, Trout, Salmon, Orange Roughy. That's pretty damn good for a small mom and pop place. They fly the Pike in directly from the lakes of Minnesota fresh, which is great. Overall, strong food selection as well outside of seafood, with dishes like Beef Wellington and London Broil to note.   ~The Bad~ Its an older location gang. You see all the reviews mentioning the former tenants and such. You can go outside, look at the roof and notice its older right away. Inside the walls are mainly filled with murals and it is dimly lit. Some people may not like this set up...actually I know a ton of people who hate any place relatively quaint and dark like this. Too bad for you. Also the prices are a bit high...$17.99 for my trout dinner? A bit much. They have to make their money somehow, and fish spoils quickly so I get it...but still, for trout? Oh well, thats my only real gripe.  ~The Downlow~ I saved the best for last: Their Happy Hour. This place has a spectacular happy hour guys. Every day is a new food special, so you never will go a day without a real kick ass special. Some days it isn't a price special, but a different food item. For example they had Walleye Dynamite the other day, which my father said was very good. Their Tuesday (I believe) Burger Special is especially of note...very inexpensive.  They get 4 stars for strong service, quaint ambiance, Great Happy Hours/Daily Specials, and a good selection on the menu.  Enjoy a Phoenix tradition and stop by Feeney's!"}
{"text":"Overpriced not even pretentious.  Dinner place comes with a choice of potato but twice bake is $2 more.  WTH ?  Really, at $20 plus on average a dinner entree?     Dinner of steaks were mediocre at best.  I have had better seasoned beef at a bar and grill for much less money.  Price is not the major issue but the place dated, dark and reeks of old."}
{"text":"The staff was super attention, the prime rib was incredible and the cheesecake was the best we ever had. Thanks Freeney's"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here a month ago.  Always meant to eat here, but  20 years ago, we were too broke, and later we'd pass it, keep on driving and say \"next time\".      Then we were broke again... :-)    I bought a Restaurant.com certificate, and we headed over.  Two words:   Really good.    Most of the reviews here sum it up well:   Retro, outdated decor.  Old-school salad bar which includes Jello.  Career wait staff.  Funky add-on, remodel areas.  Low ceilings.  Tight, weird parking.  Our food was prepared perfectly to order.  I had the filet medallions with the gorgonzola wine sauce- yum!  My husband had prime rib, perfect.    The salad bar was fresh with LOTS of choices.  Service was friendly and competent.    The mood in the place was familiar and comfortable- not a stuffy, pretentious feel.  I enjoy an eclectic mix of clientele, and that's what they have here.  No one looking to impress anyone by being at the local \"who's who\" location.    Just local folks wanting a good dinner, in a comfortable place.  Three words:  We'll be back."}
{"text":"If your looking for the best prime rib in Phoenix this is your place! The staff was incredible and loved the family owned feel of the place! It was beautifully decorated for st paddys day and received some free potato skins which were delicious. My mom and husband got the fish and chips and were very impressed , the fish was cooked perfectly. The offer a incredible salad bar with an entree order. Job well done! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very small yet quaint restaurant. My fiancé ordered the prime rib and lobster and enjoyed every single bite. I ordered the California burger which was delicious. Will visit again"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I didn't have a good experience with Feeney's. I'll start with the bad and end with the good.  First, the patio is tiny. If I were to sit on the patio, I had to share a table with someone else. Secondly, although the the wait staff were friendly, service was slow. I had a beer before the meal and requested that I get another when the meal came. My second beer came after I was finished eating. The waitress made the excuse that the keg needed changed. I get that, but it doesn't take the entire time of a whole meal to change a tap. The locals sitting near me suggested that I get the prime rib. $20 for the 8oz; based on the price, I was expecting a decent cut, but not exceptional. I was severely let down. I am aware that prime rib is fatty, but this one was more than half fat and gristle. $20 for about 4oz of edible prime.  Now for the good. The waitress was friendly and called me by name. I think it takes an impressive amount of effort to memorize your tables by name. Props to her. The potato skins appetizer was very good and had an adequate amount of sour cream on the side (I love sour cream). The baked potato was made well. The other patrons were obviously regulars and a whole conversation was happening all around me. They jumped right in to introducing themselves and included me in the talk. Finally, the horseradish with the prime rib was very tasty, with just the right spice.  I will not be returning to Feeney's for a meal, but I think it may be a decent place to drink."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and like it more, and more each time. First off they have the best Saganaki I've had in a restaurant, the cheese is very sharp and salty like it should be, and the portion size is very generous compared to most other places. I love the old school salad bar- ice cold metal plates, bacon bits, beets, macaroni and potato salads, jello, etc, reminds me of restaurants I went to as a kid. The dressings are really good and homemade, I heard one of the employee's dictating the recipes to another last time we were there. I've had the pork chops, a couple pasta dishes and the fish and chips, all were very, very good. The tartar sauce w/ the fish and chips was so good, it was surprising. That had to be homemade as well. Last time we were there we had the Mud Pie for dessert, another old school item, and it was huge and delicious. The staff is always super friendly and on top of everything. Great, great place and I'm looking forward to more great dinners here."}
{"text":"We have had dinner at Feenys several times and we have always enjoyed going there. Maria  the owner is a Beautiful classy lady with a great personality. And her son George is also very friendly they make you feel very welcomed.Ed the cook is \"awesome\" his plates always satisfy a appetite, I enjoyed the prime rib that Ed prepared for me perfectly it  was delicious and John enjoyed his pasta dish very tasty."}
{"text":"My first time visiting and it was phenomenal! The owner greeted us, as we sat in the lounge by the bar. Brought us a free appetizer because it was our first time. I ordered a glass of wine which was ok, my fault in the choice I made. However,  the owner opened a private bottle for me that's not served by the glass, and proceeded to pour me one glass so I could try it(ended up finding out it's his favorite wine). Two glasses later after he generously topped off my 2'nd(without me asking of course), I've found one of my favorite reds. How absolutely amazing of him. It's really about the little things during your dining experience. This did not disappoint. Thank you to the owner. The food was also very yummy, we split a ribeye that was done to perfection. We will be back again. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and really enjoyed it. The food was great...even the salad was delicious.I also liked the dim lighting and medieval feel.I plan to come back here for dinner with just my significant other:)"}
{"text":"Yelp said it's a good place, hubby wanted to try it. Won't be going back.  Took close to an hour to get food, ordered the shepards pie.  Wasn't very good and the gravy tasted like outta a jar.  The place is old, dark and gloomy."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times when I come to town.  The owners are very friendly and the steaks are fantastic.  Great atmosphere to relax on a business trip."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place 100's of times and never stopped here. Every time I passed by the parking lot was full and I always saw the sign out front with this giant steer on it. As my interest finally got the best of me, Twyla and I decided to give it a shot for dinner.  Upon arrival, we were greeted at the door with a warm welcome and then walked into the restaurant and seated. May I say that the service here was spot on and the staff amazing. Our food was exceptional! The twice baked potatoes are the size of Texas and every course was directed with timeliness and care.  A mother and her son are the owners and operators. They reside from Greece but have been here a long time and operating this fabulous restaurant. From the chilled pewter plates at the salad bar to the \"never having to ask for anything, including to go boxes.\" this place was awesome! I'm calling it a hidden gem because most people would not know to go here.  It resonates the old steakhouse feel with dark wood and rustic decor.  The bar screams to be hung out at and the crowd there was good. I added pictures of the menu as the portions are massive and the prices are half of other local steakhouses. The wine list needs a boost or I would have given this establishment five stars.  So, both Twyla and I would highly recommend a night out. The owners are so fun and hospitable but so are we... Enjoy!  #Vino2 #Vinosquared #Vino2ultimate #Irishcatv2 #jimsboisset"}
{"text":"Great place! Excellent prime rib. The staff and owners are very friendly and service is great. I love this place and go there frequently. It's a little neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"We had dinner last Friday night, party of about 20 of us... This was my first time to Feeneys, but have friends who have been going there for many, many years... I've heard so many different opinions from, Fantastic to old dirty dive! My first impressions were good, nice old school feel, very old building, but I like nostalgia. I think we are to quick to knock down an older building to rebuild, and I wish we would keep some of the older establishments around.. Anyway.... Feeneys has a good and fresh salad bar with the BEST homemade blue cheese dressing I've ever had, I can't rave enough about the blue cheese, I think they should bottle & sell it! I had the \"Feeneys cut\" of Prime rib (rare) with there delicious au ju & horseradish sauce (ask for the plain horseradish to add to there standard sauce, it makes ALL the difference) Gotta say Best Prime Rib I've had in years! The service was very good as well, the owner actually waited on us & my party didnt make it easy on her, they asked for separate checks, and she did a phenomenal job.. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered & heard the lamb chops were awesome...Two thumbs up! The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, is because there was some sticky stuff on table where I was sitting when I arrived, but they quickly cleaned it up for me! I'll be taking my Momma to Feeneys for Prime rib & of course salad with blue cheese dressing very soon!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop into Feeney's as my boyfriend had never been and it has been years (10 or so) since the last time I was there. When we arrived we were promptly greeted and seated.   with menus. I had a glass of wine and by boyfriend had a vodka/tonic. My wine was huge! Great deal. We checked in on Yelp and redeemed our potato skin appetizer which was great! fried perfectly and crunchy!!! I knew that I wanted prime rib as I was craving it and they always have great prime rib. My boyfriend ordered the smaller filet. We both had the salad bar and he also had mashed potato and I had the twice baked for a few dollars more. When my dinner came out I was SHOCKED at how LARGE my twice potato was! I knew I was going to take it home for leftovers as well. This thing had to be 2 lbs don't let the picture fool you...it was dense and huge! I hate my prime rib which was cooked perfectly and the creamy horseradish was PERFECT! Not to mellow and not to hot! My boyfriend enjoyed his filet and taters too and ate every bite. Service was great and we will certainly be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Service was AMAZING. Tasty food. A family owned joint for sure. Everyone working there made sure we were well taken care of. 10% discount from Yelp. Comped dessert. Lovely conversation. If I'm back this way again I'll be back there."}
{"text":"Best lamb chops I have tasted since I visited New Zealand. Sweet potato fries were the best I have ever had. I am definitely returning to this restaurant. Beef Wellington was cooked perfectly and the sauce was exactly as it should be."}
{"text":"We ordered our food, it was bland nothing had flavor and the price was outrageous. The service was horrible we never got asked to have our drinks refilled  We will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Sentimental college days date location!  Revisited this old fav of mine and it was \"cheese-burger night!  So a few of us had burgers which were delicious, but I had to stroll down memory lane and have my old favorite the base-ball cut sirloin.      All the food was very good and the salad bar was delicious and had not changed in 29 years!!   The proprietors were very hands on and involved with service the entire evening....very refreshing to see and independent locals place survive this O-Bama economy!  Please give Feeney's a try!"}
{"text":"Monday nights you get a sirloin burger and fries for $4 -- awesome deal. Good burger. Add cheese, avocado, bacon, mushrooms, etc. for a small up charge. Get all you can eat (simple) salad bar for an additional $2.75. TVs with Monday night football in the bar and on the patio -- great, chill Monday night option."}
{"text":"I like Feeney's. I must because I have been eating there for over 10 years. I like the owner of Feeney's (partially because his name is so much fun to say - Elias Pantazopoulos - but he will answer to Louie). Over the years, there have been very few times that Louie hasn't stopped by our table to make sure everything was ok. And although I would like to think it's because I'm special... it's really not. He genuinely cares about the people that come to his establishment and wants them to feel comfortable expressing their likes or suggestions.  This place is small and mostly dark (the perfect place for a quiet dinner with your someone special) without one iota of pretentiousness. The brick walls, archways, and dark wood accents give it a little bit of an East coast feel topped off with the tiled exhibition kitchen complete with a shiney copper hood.  The menu is mostly comprised of great steaks and sea food, but there are always a large selection of daily specials that are sure to mix things up. Most meals come with a trip to the salad bar... but beware, portions are pretty large, so make sure not to overload before your meal ever arrives. They have a full service bar up in front and if you are looking for a different game venue, grab a seat in there. The drinks are very reasonably priced, strong, and never run dry. They also have a hearty list of apps that you can supplement your drinks with, for the perfect game day fix.  If you haven't over-indulged with your meal, you MUST order the Mud Pie. It is a ginormous slab of goodness! Dark chocolate cookie crust, loaded with coffee ice cream and topped with a super fudgy ganache layer that you will want to rub all over your body.  Feeney's is a genuine rarity. It's a great little steakhouse that serves up above average meat but doesn't have a foo-foo bone in its body. Call ahead to make sure they have a table and head over to Feeney's. Oh and as Laura B. mentions, they are on restaurant.com so you can get a great deal on any meal.  I have to go now... there is a piece of pie calling my name!"}
{"text":"Omg. The hubby and I ate here last night for dinner on our random getaway to Phoenix AZ.  Its a diamond in the rough!  The staff was so amazing. You felt the love when you walk in the door... the food was so tastey!  And never once was our cup empty! We were so full and satisfied Well worth the drive from Riverside CA. The hubby says we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I stumbled upon this gem!  I had driven by a few times on my way home and decided to stop in for a drink.  The bar is small and full of life.  The same regulars have been warming the stools for years and they have the crazy dynamic going on that's so entertaining.  As soon as I sat down the bartender introduced me to everyone and they treated me like one of the gang from there on.    To eat I've had the filet mignon and burger - both were full of flavor and cooked perfectly to my specifications.  Everyone you encounter at this place is so warm and friendly, you want to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review of Feeney's, as when I read the review of my initial visit, I was sort of shocked. It is now one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  First, make sure you check out their website for the nightly specials. Wednesday night is particularly great, with your choice of 5 freshly prepared entrees, including potato or vegetable, AND soup or salad for $10. Nice.  Second, when you check in on yelp, look for the instant 10% off coupon. Immediately. For that use. Not a \"10% off after 4 visits\" or a one time use. Every time. Nice.  Third, I am always a bit taken aback by the sincere friendliness of the staff, especially the owner. She always remembers us, even when we haven't been for a few months and we are always greeted with a big hug and a hearty \"Hello! Welcome back!\". Nice.  Fourth, the salad bar that I was unimpressed with in my first review impresses me now not for its variety, but for its consistently fresh and always well stocked bounty. Not only leafy salads on the salad bar, but some slaws, a few pasta salad choices, and lots of very fresh veggies. And I'm a sucker for the carrots that have been shaved into curls and the cool fresh ground pepper mill. While you are getting your salad, the chef(s) will routinely visit with you, as the kitchen is right behind the salad bar. Nice.  On my visit last night, I started with the onion rings as an appetizer. They were good. No flavorgasm like the ones at Durant's, but then how could they compete with those? I had the $10 special Salisbury steak with mashed potatoes and salad. Salisbury steak has been much maligned by the Swanson TV Dinners of old. When done right, and Feeney's does it right, it is a flavorful piece of ground prime steak. Here's a hint, if they ask you how you want your Salisbury steak cooked, you pretty much know it is going to be better than the chopped steak meal you are going to get at other restaurants. The mushroom gravy is an added treat for both the steak and the mashed potatoes. Another at the table subbed the fresh veggies for the potato, and they were a nice assortment of zucchini, squash, and broccoli. Not a limp, greasy garnish like you get some places if you opt out of the potato portion. Nice.  Another hug upon our leaving. Goodbyes from the waiter and the bar staff. You can easily see why most of people you see in Feeney's are regulars. Count me as one now."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town.  Went with a co worker during lunch, food was great and service was wonderful.  A must vist again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place while searching for a restaurant that serves Beef Wellington.  We went for dinner tonight and I can say this is our new favorite spot.   We started with Calamari which was good. It came with 2 sauces, a cocktail sauce and a chunkier tomato sauce which I loved.    I had the Wellington and my boyfriend had the sirloin and shrimp. The Wellington was fantastic! so juicy and the gravy was rich and delicious. My boyfriend likes his steak \"Black and blue\" which is not common and usually when he orders it that way it comes out too done. The chef came out and asked him how rare he would like the middle and when it came it was perfect. His steak also came with 2 gigantic shrimp that were sweet and tender.   We finished with Creme Brulee that was very creamy but not overly sweet. (Which for me is a good thing!)  The prices were very good. We basically had a 4 course meal for about 90.00 and everything was wonderful! We will be going back and the sooner the better."}
{"text":"Old school vibe. Had a pretty good rib eye here.  The salad bar was legit.  I went thru the line twice.  Nice neighborhood feel to it. The bar by the front was dimly lit and a place I wouldn't mind hiding out and drinking in one afternoon.  Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"If you like that rustic, trip down memory lane type of steakhouse this is the place for you!  The food and staff were great!  Do a check in w/ Yelp you get 10% off!"}
{"text":"I used to come for the booze (I actually still do!) but I wound up bringing my family in for dinner while they were visiting from out of town. Being the zealous consumer of lamb that he is, my father ordered the Greek-style lamb chops. Needless to say that every time he's in town, he HAS to go to Feeney's and have the lamb. He has since tried the pork chops (also Greek-style) and is just as much of a fan of those. I've brought in other family since who are also nuts about the lamb. So bottom line, if you're into lamb, come here and take it Greek-style! Not a lamb eater myself, I usually get the filet mignon. There is just something about the way the filet is prepared, old-school style and not a lot of bells and whistles. Bells and whistles are not needed because it's just so damned good: tender and flavorful. What else is delicious? The calamari is AWESOME-probably one of my favorite in any restaurant anywhere. The service here is above and beyond. Maria and George and the rest of the servers treat all of their customers like family which is why they have so much repeat business. In addition, you will never have an empty glass in front of you, whether is beer, wine cocktails, soda, coffee, even your glass of water is always refilled. Sure there are other places in The Valley that are fancier where the food comes to your table almost too pretty to eat, but that comes with a price tag and often a nice appearance is used to mask inferior quality. Not the case here, you always enjoy a good, down-home, no-nonsense meal with great service and all at a VERY reasonable cost."}
{"text":"HAHAHA so I work in a restaurant and rarely allow myself a night out. My boyfriend and I had a long day at work and decided to smoke a bowl, get a great bite to eat and a bottle of wine. We decided on Feeneys because several of our friends highly recommended it. I ordered filet and a bottle of wine and absolutely loved every bit of it. Amanda was taking care of us and she was absolutely phenomenal. Then the owner had some sort of meltdown. She came out screaming about smelling pot and that she'd cut off someone's legs if she found out they smoked. Uhm...hi I just spent an hour and a hundred bucks in your restaurant but now I'm leaving and never coming back because you're a psycho. Thanks."}
{"text":"Not bad and not great.  This place is more atmosphere than anything else - it feels like a place you'd bring your grandfather to get a steak, with dim lighting and an old been here 30 years neighborhood bar feel. There's lots of beef on the menu and the food is decent.  I tried the Beef Wellington  - basically a filet mignon cooked into a puff pastry with gravy on top.  It was pretty good, especially the steak, and I kinda wished I'd just ordered the meat on its own.  The gravy was too salty.  All in though, Feeney's is worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had come in here on Saturday. I was planning to bring her on a Wednesday but she was so moody and angry...it was hard to accomplish anything with her. Wednesday is when they have some pretty good specials at good prices I hear, Thursday, and one other day I believe.   In any which case, the parking wasn't bad...I got a spot up front. However, the parking lot was like a strip design so if you have a large SUV like I do, you might have issues with reversing and leaving, etc.   The place looks pretty old school. There' s a small patio in front for smoking and presumably eating as well with some coasters and a TV inset...was pretty nice.   There's a small bar to the right when you go in and a salad bar and probably the cooking area front to the rear. I presume the bathroom is off to the side as well. When you get in, there's a small waiting area/lobby to the left. It looks pretty comfy on the couch.   We were shown our seats immediately. We waiting a few minutes for our server to get our drinks while guys were cleaning up our table off to the corner meant for two. They were quick about it and the busboy made some small talk, everyone seemed fairly friendly.   After our waitress took our drink order and appetizers which, was a potato skin appetizer we got free since I checked in on Yelp!Mobile and crab stuffed mushrooms, we probably waiting another 15 minutes for her to come back and take our order. My girlfriend picked out a filet mignon med-rare with rice pilaf and a side of steamed vegetables instead of the soup or salad. She didn't want a salad and they were out of soup of the day or the soup. I got a New York strip steak with a rice pilaf and a salad. You can either get your salad before or after entree. I went ahead and got the salad before entree since I'm a fat kid that needs to fill as fast and often as possible. They have a salad bar which has some pretty decent selections. There some macaroni stuff that I wanted to try too but I didn't, sadly. About 10-15 minutes after I got my salad, the steaks and stuff came. My girlfriend thought her steak and food was pretty good. I thought my steak was pretty good even though it looked way more rare than I usually would get. Let's be honest, when she asked me how I wanted my steak, I wanted to tell her, \"breathing.\" Heh, a page taken right out of Chuck Norris' book.  Anyways, the food was good. The check came out what I expected and we left pleased. I would come back again since my girlfriend liked it here."}
{"text":"As I was reading the rest of the reviews of Feeney's prior to lodging my own, I realized that I have never been there for the dinner hour! So I can't comment on the lights, candles, and ambience aforementioned.  As Arik mentionined, Crystal is one of the best bartenders I have ever met! She has the best combination of customer service and sassiness that many of us bar regulars love. I've been to Feeney's a few times for drinks, and always had a great experience. They have a really cool patio for smokers as well.   I think the thing I love about this place is that there are so many regular fixtures, presumably from the neighborhood. The times I have been there have been the early happy hour times, and it feels like a neighborhood bar, except the median age of patrons is closer to my parents age than mine. But not in a creepy way.   I have had lunch there once, a few months ago, and it was very fine (3 stars). I had a club sandwich, my other 3 companions had sandwiches as well, and we were all satisfied.   The 4 stars comes from the bar, its patrons, and the bartenders."}
{"text":"Love the Location, it is right around the corner from our home. So we decided to give this a try for the first time.   The staff is super friendly and let us know about the special right away. Im glad we tried it out. The 5.99 burger deal was way worth it. It was also delicious! The Gf also got the fried ice cream which was very tasty.  We will be back to try out the prime rib"}
{"text":"To say that this was disappointing is an understatement. My husband and I wanted to give this place a whirl to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. We set up a reservation through Open Table and were excited to have a lovely steak & lobster/crab dinner...until...  Not sure if they lost 1/2 their staff that night (no one was paying attention to the door), but we walked in, looked around for a host/ess or a sign that said \"Seat Yourself\". Not seeing either option, we kinda lurked around the bar area and stood watching a basketball game. About 5-10 minutes in, a woman said she would be right with us. Once we were seated, we were asked immediately what we would like to drink (yes, before we had any menus). Hubby ordered a beer and asked for a wine list. Then no contact for another 10-15 minutes. The table on the side of ours was muttering something about not seeing their waiter for awhile.   Prior to arriving, I researched their menu and was really looking forward to trying their Oscar Tournedos dish (filet topped with crab meat and a bernaise sauce over mashed potatoes). The waiter, initially unsure as to whether they still had that dish, informed me that it is no longer on the menu. He said that the filet medallions would be somewhat comparable as long as I like gorgonzola cheese. I went with it. Hubby had the ribeye medium rare, and we ordered the potato skins appetizer (ONLY because of the Yelp deal when we checked-in, otherwise I don't order potato skins) and the salad bar. I ordered a glass of Malbec.   The wine was delicious. the potato skins were tasty, if a bit overdone. The salad bar was really good. My steak was a little underdone (I ordered medium (as I was informed that if I usually order medium well, then medium is the way to go), it came back as medium rare. Not necessarily a deal-breaker for me (since it was a quality piece of meat), but I am unsure as to where the gorgonzola was underneath all of that thick brown gravy. *sigh*   Once the plates were on the table, we never saw our waiter again. We never got any water refills. We were never asked if we would like another beverage even though our glasses were empty. After asking for our bill 4 times, the lady from the beginning of our journey meandered her way to our table, mentioned something about it being a tough night (I think the cook walked out?), and asked if we needed anything. I mentioned that we were disappointed with the service, that it was our anniversary, that we were really looking forward to the experience but were disappointed in how the evening went, and, to add insult to injury, not only did she disregard all of that, she also charged us for the potato skins.   The table that was looking for their waiter in paragraph 2 was still waiting for something when we left. If I were a betting woman, I would say they were just waiting for the opportunity to slink out of there since it seemed as though no one really cared one way or the other."}
{"text":"Very good old school Steak restaurant that reminds me of how they used to be when I was a kid. It is kind of nice to see that a few places like this are still around. The prices are reasonable and the food is good. The service is superb. The best part is they serve dinner till 10 pm. My only complaint was the steaks are cooked a little more well done than most places so order it a bit less done than usual."}
{"text":"Old Fashioned Steak House worth coming to Excellent Food and the Shrimps Cocktails and Potatoes Skin Oooh mama. First Time here we had  great time and order the Prime Rib it was delicious. Excellent Service....."}
{"text":"Somebody mentioned the liver and onions here were good.  Didn't take much after that for a small gathering to check it out. They were indeed good.  We also had a couple of shared appetizers. Loved the feel of the place. After the baseball game was over it got sort of quiet which surprised me on a Friday evening. The service was great the whole time. This is a place I wouldn't mind coming back to to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"My hubby selected Feeney's for my bday dinner because I have been dying to try a Beef Wellington after watching Hell's Kitchen for years.  Pastry and beef, hello!!!    This place is one of those old school restaurants, tables, and feel.  I remember these places when I was a kid.  We were greeted right away and she turned out to be our server too.  Maria was awesome and her support staff.  Our drinks were never empty and they came to check on us multiple times but not to the point that they are standing over us.    We ordered: Chicken Wings with Ranch - Those little things are spicy but so crispy.  The ranch helped to cut some of the spicy.  Cream of Broccoli Soup - Thick, creamy, and good.  Beef Wellington - OMG, it was good.  It was so good, I could not stop eating.  The mash potato and gravy was a great side to go with my wellington.    Lamp Chops - My hubby loved it!  He said we are coming back!!!  They bread that came with the meal was so good!!!  I ate both pieces of the rye.  My husband had the pumpernickel.  The server found out we were there to celebrate my bday, so she bought me a huge slice of mud pie (ice cream).  It was so good and they sang happy birthday to me.  Too bad, I was only available to have a few bites.  I was so full from the wellington, but happy bday to my hubby, he inhaled MY mud pie.  =)"}
{"text":"We came here around 5 on a Sat. evening and it was already really busy! Surprising for such an early nite.  The ambiance was really cool, brick walls, old-time feel that we found refreshing among so many new and modern places everywhere else.   The server was very busy but attentive and helpful. We both ordered chicken dishes with the salad bar, which was well-stocked with a lot of options, all of which were fresh.  The prices were fair and the portions were reasonable.  I wouldn't say the food was anything extraordinary but it was tasty, hot, and filling.  We'll be back when we're in that area of town again, for sure! :)"}
{"text":"Went here again for the second time in 3 months, and like the first time I was not disappointed. The owner, Maria, is wonderful and so nice, and the rest of the staff is great as well. The food is so good, I have tried the Prime Rib and the Beef Wellington, both are worth eating again and again."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places. Judy tending bar during the week has locals and long time customers coming in just to see her. She's a doll and a great person to boot. Great little salad bar. Always fresh and well stocked. Burger Monday, Brunch on Sunday and their prime rib. All top notch."}
{"text":"Wow! Had the beef Wellington and I can say it was incredibly delicious! Wait staff was very polite and knowledgable. Will be back for sure! No drive could keep that from happening!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe the recent great reviews of this place! Had been meaning to go there for awhile and finally did last week as a pre-Christmas dinner, yuk! The place was dead on a Saturday night, we passed on the salad bar that looked lifeless and tasteless after our server basically forced us to go check it out. Mistake on her part as we saw some of the kitchen prep space that was filthy. The whole place seemed to be in need of a good cleaning. Now the food...I've never had a twice baked potato with so many lumps... My filet was cooked medium like I asked but no seasoning whatsoever...this place had me thinking of writing in to bar rescue or restaurant impossible for them! Definitely would not recommend or return, a shame we spent $80 here."}
{"text":"Feeney's is a great locals place that has been around for years. I only started going there a couple of years ago and had probably missed out for a long time.   When walking in, you are immediately greeted by one of the very friendly family members. We had a party of five and made a reservation on Open Table (I think all restaurants should be on Open Table by the way). Right away we were taken back to our table. Feeney's is small with several small rooms of tables so I would recommend making a reservation for any size party.   We placed our drink order, margarita for me, martinis or beer for my friends. They serve about 100 types of bottled beer and have a few on draft. This is when I made my check in on Yelp and was awarded a free potato skin appetizer. Why not!?  When our server returned with the drinks I mentioned our free appetizer. He said, \"I saw you check in, I've already ordered it for you.\"  Nice!  For the main event three of us had the prime rib, one had the ribeye and one had fish and chips. From what she was saying, the ribeye was outstanding, she could not have been happier with it. I was told that the fish and chips was also very good. As for our prime rib, it was good but needed a little boost in flavor. Still it was a beautiful cut of meat and tender. I was the only one who had been to Feeney's before and have only had the prime rib, so obviously it was normally outstanding. As I said, the prime rib had always been good in the past, it was probably just one of those not so flavorful slabs of meat that the restaurant received. I will return and I will order the prime rib again!   Let me back up to the choices that come with entrees. Salad bar or soup and your choice of side item. I opted for the salad bar as I always do when dining there. It's a nice little salad bar with several choices of toppings. They also have several choices for your side item with a small up charge for a large twice baked potato ($2). It's very worth it!  I am not a dessert person normally, but I always get one there. The mud pie!  Coffee ice cream, Oreo cookie crust and chocolate topping. Mmm! Delicious!  All and all this is a fantastic place. Support a local family owned business and check out Feeney's. They also have daily specials!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Family restaurant with amazing service! The flaming Greek appetizer is beautiful and delicious! The bartender/server Amanda is incredible and always makes sure you are happy and content! The selection of brews is hard to beat!"}
{"text":"WOW, first time here and had such a wonderful experience! The food is simply delicious and the service is the friendliest I've had ever! The owners were present and greeted every table as they made sure to keep a tidy environment. I will be back and recommend this place to others.  It's such a nice non-chain local spot to support!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, my friend found Feeney's from an Internet search.  The three of us were in the mood for steak and this place seemed like it fit the bill.  We were seated immediately, towards the back of the restaurant.  That's person number one we encountered.  The second person came and filled up our water glasses.  After waiting awhile a third person came to take our order.  Not one of the three people we encountered asked if we wanted anything else to drink besides water.  Meanwhile at the table across from us, wine and other cocktails were brought to their table and also bread.  We thought they may be dignitaries because of the great attention they got compared to our pithy service.  When we saw the bread, we asked for an order.  It was brought to our table but the server appeared put off by our request. Our steaks finally arrived served by yet another person. The filet was dry and served on tomatoes.  The ribeye was overcooked.  The prime rib was nothing to write home about.  When we were ready for the check we had to ask someone for it and yet another person brought it out.  Overall, service was poor to say the least.  The meal was meh.  Find somewhere else to go, or perhaps if you are a dignitary, your experience will be different."}
{"text":"I found this place because my mom was craving liver and onions. Upon arrival, it didn't look like much from outside, but once you go in, you encounter old world charm. My mom who's originally from Germany fell in love with the style of this restaurant/bar. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and were seated. Thereafter the owner followed up and recommended the special of the day- 3 tacos made with prime rib. I ordered the special and my mom ordered the liver and onions. The food was delicious- my mom is picky and she loved her food. My tacos were outstanding- the meat perfectly cooked and so tender- they came with an avocado-garlic mayo which was to die for- and also rice pilaf which I did not like- it was a bit salty.   The owner offered drinks from the bar- however we had coffee and water.  They have daily specials at great prices.   Pros & cons Pros- the owner is very attentive and he genuinely cares about his customers. I noticed all of the staff working together to get their jobs done and they all smiled. The restaurant was clean, and tables bussed immediately. The food is superb, the meat is fresh and tender. The bar appears to offer many different beers and drinks. Great vibe throughout and they have an outdoor seating area right at the front entrance.  There is also a larger dining area towards the back which was well lit.   Cons- it was a little dark when you first walk in-front dining room- low ceilings contribute to this, the bathroom is a bit small and not handicap friendly ( my mom uses a walker and it was very hard to get into the larger stall) and there was a sewer odor in the restroom. No lemon offered for my water. We will definitely be returning when we are in the area; we found a new favorite."}
{"text":"Five stars for Judy period. Five stars for fish and chips special-  get it. Five stars for cozy ambiance. It is a Phoenix treasure. Its not perfect but some things matter more than others. Great little fireplace at the back."}
{"text":"Chances are you haven't heard of Feeney's.   It used to be the Cork 'n Cleaver twenty or thirty years ago, but it has since split off and now is its own steakhouse and bar.   I can't speak thoroughly as to the food, since it has changed substantially since my last visit to eat, but I understand that the menu has expanded and has a Greek flair to it now.  The bar, however, I can speak to. It is probably the darkest bar I have ever spent much time in and I love that about it. Their motto should be \"Redefining Shady.\"   It is a dive in many respects, but the regulars may not agree with that. Drinks are cheap and easy to come by in the very small bar area, and everyone seems to know the bartenders by name. If they know you and like you, you can even request music or bring in a CD and they may play it for you while you sip a smokey gin and tonic. But play your cards right, because they absolutely play favorites.   The patio is comfortable for one group only but, it's all yours if you get it first."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place on yelp!! This place knows how to do potatoes... We tried the potato skins, mashed and a twice baked... all were quite tasty! Happy hour every day from 3pm-7pm. Service was on point!"}
{"text":"Had 45 minutes to kill so stopped in for a beer and a bite. Pleasantly surprised they're still here! Wow! Nice appetizers, had killer Calamari! They've a beautiful little lunch menu, great house wine, & bartender Judy is lovely. We'll be back for dinner to try the Prime Rib for Tom, Hummus for me... lobster ... crime brûlée - that menu will keep us busy. Nice steakhouse atmosphere, beautiful menu - Can't wait to try the steaks."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been our go-to for every Christmas Eve since the late 90's.  How things have changed!  We've always loved the ambiance and the ability to have a family gathering without a lot of hassles, especially on Christmas Eve.  2016 was different.  They had ONE PAGE of a menu for us to choose from, and all of their steak/prime rib prices were about $8-10 over the prices we used to pay.  The three adults ordered prime rib and asked for medium or medium-well -- our prime ribs came still mooing!  in addition, we had our six-year-old grandson with us.  I asked for a KID'S MENU -- they have NONE!!!  There was NO WAY on EARTH I was paying $24.95 for 10-oz. prime rib for a SIX-YEAR-OLD (this was the cheapest  protein on the menu!)  They wouldn't even offer him a hamburger or chicken fingers -- NOTHING -- NO ACCOMMODATIONS WHATSOEVER.  He ended up eating crackers and french fries. For this reason alone, we will not be eating at Feeney's EVER again."}
{"text":"This was a little gem of a place we happened to find, good food, good service, funky older location, try it!"}
{"text":"My bf and I came here for Valentine's Day and we're very happy we did! We chose the salad bar since tomato soup was the only option that night (neither of us are big on tomato soup). We were slightly bummed because we knew how typical salad bars are. Well we thought we knew! Feeney's salad bar is so fresh and delicious though! They also offer potato salad and macaroni salad which was an awesome bonus. Next we ordered fried zucchini. BEST fried zucchini we both have ever had! Melt in your mouth buttery, without being soggy nor undercooked. For our main dishes I got the filet mignon (butterfly cut, well done) with mashed potatoes and my bf got a huge ribeye (medium well) with fries. My entree was on the smaller side but so filling and juicy even though Maria (the owner and sweetest lady ever!) cringed when I ordered it well done lol. My bf's entree was humongous and he had to throw in the towel about 2/3 of the way through it. We both loved our entrees! Only downfalls were the wait time for our meal and that they weren't offering twice baked potatoes that night. But it was a holiday so it makes sense! We will definitely be back again:)"}
{"text":"Two stars because our waiter was so terrific. Neat place on the inside. Food was terrible. - steak overdone - gorgonzola sauce is thick brown grave made from a mix - no gorgonzola inside. Very expensive for what you get - so disappointing."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff . Ambiance was nice with warm rustic wood everywhere. We had the Prime rib and the Salad bar. Food was fresh, hot and tasted great."}
{"text":"Great food.   Even better service.   Lamb chops must be ordered Greek style.  Made my family feel like their family.   Even went out to find me matches for a birthday cake.   You'd be a fool to skip this restaurant."}
{"text":"We've been dying to have dinner here (happy hours have been top notch.)   The old school ambiance, complete with the classic salad bar is worth the trip alone.  The Manhattan Chowder was maybe the best I've had.  The Prime Rib and Beef Wellington were solid choices, particularly with the yummy twice baked potatoes.  The lamb chops were flavorful but could have been a little more tender.  Probably the only thing that we wouldn't try again is the Shepherds Pie.  However, the highlight of the meal was the impressive Baked Alaska for dessert.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We will be back! Maria was a delight, the prime rib was phenomenal and the cheesecake was some of the best we've ever tasted. The Yelp free potato skins were so-so but uhh they were free so whatever. New neighborhood favorite, for sure!!"}
{"text":"Drove by here a thousand times, first time stopping in. Cool little place. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff. Nice allotment of locals, friendly bunch. Decent selection of wine, top shelf Liquor and draft beer. I recommend giving Feeney's a try. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great little hole in the wall.  Apparently theyre categorized as a steakhouse? Whatever. Ive never had a steak there but Ive tried a LOT of the rest of their menu. Delicious. Their reuben is my fave.   I love the atmosphere here. It looks a little fancier than it is. Very chill.  It's actually a great place to watch football on Sundays.  Pro: technically, theyre a Redskins bar.  Con: technically, theyre a Yankees bar."}
{"text":"Don't be afraid of the location. Small, older neighborhood place that has a lot to offer. Came here for brunch on a Sunday and it was amazing! Prime rib eggs Benedict is great!"}
{"text":"This place is walking distance from me, I went in once but it took nearly 20 minutes to get a glass of water and a menu, at that point I walked out, maybe they were short handed. Went back again and it was not to busy, order the world famous prime rib and sadly I have to say I wasn't really impressed. The grilled shrimp and the au jus sauce were pretty good but the steak just lacked everything and it was cold, I was to hungry to wait another 15 minutes for another steak and clearly that can't re-heat the one I have. Maybe down the road I will give it another try."}
{"text":"I wrote a less-than-stellar review of Feeney's and I've taken it down. I've taken it down because the owner/operator reached out to me immediately after the review posted. He offered me my money back and a free meal. I will accept neither.   Can't ask for much more than that, right?  (A working food thermometer...he'll know what I mean.)  While my own experience at Feeney's is in the past, one has to be impressed with a restauranteur who cares. He DOES care and my guess now is, if you go there the owner will INSIST you get satisfaction. That's good enough for me."}
{"text":"This is where you go to have a good steak! Absolutely the best service and the owner personally served us and was delightful. The steaks were cooked to perfection, huge baked potato and a great salad. When you first pull up to the building you're wondering if you're at a dive bar or a restaurant, but once inside the ambiance is warm and wonderful with sectioned off rooms for quiet dining. This was our first time in and we will definitely be back and recommending it! 5 stars  all the way! P.S. The fried ice cream and creme brûlée was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"$4 dollar burger special Monday nights! Beer and drinks are a bit overpriced, but the week night specials are worth it."}
{"text":"This is place is solid.  It's not fancy; it's in an old building with a low ceiling, but it's family run and very welcoming.  I like to support places like this.  Much better than a chain restaurant.  The chicken piccata was delicious.  All meals come with your choice of soup or a trip to the salad bar, plus your choice of sides.  Portions were solid.  You won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Had a great night here with my boyfriend and new friends. First time and it was amazing. Food and service was above and beyond what I expected. The place is out of the way and looks dodgy from the outside but very warm and pleasant on the inside. Kinda pricey but worth it.  We tried the London Broil and it was tender and well seasoned. Also had a \"Envious Passion\" martini....it was radioactive green and was sensational!  I recommend this place for anything from hanging out with friends or family to a romantic dinner. Well worth it."}
{"text":"6th time here, never disappoints.  One of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley. Service, price and quality of food is 2nd to none."}
{"text":"Took the wife out for a birthday dinner. Kudos to the whole staff everything was excellent. Daughter burger came out late and they took it off the bill without being asked. Definitely a place for a special occasion or just a great meal. Will be back again. My only complaint is that I didn't find out about this place sooner."}
{"text":"Feeneys, you win. I really tried to like the place. We've been there four times. Cheap burgers on Mondays, who can resist? Welll, I now can. How hard is it to cook a hamburger? Apparently impossible. Four times we have ordered both of our hamburgers with little or no pink, and five times (we sent one back twice!) they have come back bloody. Tonight, they returned it on the same bloody bun.  Feeneys, PLEASE teach your cooks what well done means! Fully cooked doesn't mean cinders, but it does mean NO PINK!   The staff is generally friendly and welcoming. Drinks are only fair. The salad bar is great. I give a lot of leeway because I really love small, local restaurants. But really, if you consistently can't cook a hamburger to customer specifications, I can't keep going."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer at this restaurant over the last several years and in the past have been satisfied with the quality of the steak that I  order.   But when I ate at the restaurant last month (April, 2014) and ordered the Teriyaki sirloin, I got one of the worst steaks I have ever eaten.  It appeared to be a different cut of meat in compared to what I am accustomed to eat there.  The Teriyaki sauce I was given was a watery liquid with a hint of teriyaki flavor and nothing like the pungent sauce I have been given in the past.   I have also noticed other changes in the service.  They used to serve warm slices of delicious bread, which have been replaced with rubbery rolls. I won't go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I make a damn good Clam Chowder but Feeney' is the best!!! Absolutely delicious! Hands down the best service and dining experience around!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for a while. It is a small brick building that is sort of cramped inside. There were a lot of older people at the bar inside and there is also a patio outside you can smoke at. The parking lot was sort of cramped too and they also valet available.  I think I could have made a better selection off of the menu. I ordered a new york strip with a baked potatoes. The steak was very bland; in fact, everyone at my table had ordered a steak and they were all putting A1 steak sauce, salt and pepper on their meat. I was appalled by this because you should be able to eat a steak that costs upwards 20 dollars without having to put A1 or salt on it. Once I was done battling my steak the baked potato I had ordered with it was too cold to enjoy.  The salad bar that came with my meal was good, I don't have anything bad to say about it. The people that ordered soup instead of salad enjoyed theirs. I think this is the wrong place to order a steak from though.  The server was very quirky but did a fine job taking down our orders. Unfortunately when it came time to split the bill she got really confused and a person from our party accompanied her to the register to help her out.  Overall it was not a bad experience. I am willing to give it another shot and try something different off of the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Everything! Great place to take out of town guests or a date . Good for families too! burgers are delicious... wiping my chin...ooh and they have a great salad bar. Try the Beef Wellington and Calamari for sure."}
{"text":"tried this restaraunt due to excellent yelp reviews, so glad I did! Had Prime Rib, it was wonderful! Best prime rib I've had in a long time! I highly recommend this restaraunt!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to go to this restaurant because of the amazing reviews. Here's the nitty gritty. The service was excellent. Everyone was extremely friendly, gracious, and warm. I felt like I was at a real mom and pop joint. The place was clean and extremely accommodating considering my two toddler boys were running amuck (yikes!) The bad: There's a smoking patio RIGHT next to the entrance. I can't stand the smell of cigarette smoke and it kind of sucked having to walk my kids through it. The meh: the food. As much as I want to give this place a great review for the food (because their service was so great) but I really can't. The free potato skins were okay (yelp checkin deal), the dinner rolls actually were pretty good, the baked potato was... nothing special, and the ribeye was meh. I was especially disappointed with the ribeye and so was my husband. It wasn't horrible, it wasn't great, it was just okay. Maybe my high expectations were the problem, but maybe not. I'll stick with our favorite steakhouse for now (Bobby Q)."}
{"text":"Five stars for the prime rib!  The best I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"I love a local place where the regulars are smoking outside and taking their spots at the bar which is where I ate. Started off by the nicest lady greeting me and making me feel like a regular even though this is my first visit. I ordered the fried zucchini as I love that appetizer. This one had actual flavor in the breading and you could taste the zucchini and was delicious. The chicken vegetable soup tasted homemade. I don't know if it was but it tasted it. So good. The trout almandine was the perfect portion size and do I really need to say why the baked potato was so good? Why can't everyone make a perfect baked potato? The flavors on my meal were outstanding.  NOW.... most won't agree with my review. Most people like that trendy... mediocre... Luke warm greeting by hired kids as hostesses (I don't go to Hillstone any longer after years of patronage because I just got tired of the pretentiousness of the staff.... you work there... stop acting like that makes you better than me) and food that is good but not outstanding and the prices about 7-9 dollars more than the food is worth.... I mean.... 5-9$ for a bake potato other places? Please. This is a place where you have to choose from many popular items on the menu and you can come back 2-3 times a month or more.... because it's like eating at home but in a restaurant. I was happy to eat here. I will definitely be back. If you need to see and be seen go to the new places. If you just want to eat a good decent meal.... Feeney's is it. Old school. I feel like everyone from the cooks to the very nice bartender.... George was invested in my dinner.... oh the lady who nicely greeted me and talked to me on the way out?..... THE OWNER. good luck with that at any trendy Phoenix restaurant. Mealand appetizer with a good glass of Merlot.... $35. I feel as though I got my money's worth. I mean jeez I just spent $348 with tip for dinner for two at Steak 44. I don't think it was $300 better than my meal here.... even though Steak 44 is still my favorite restaurant. Please try this place the next time you get tired of being disappointed at other places. I'm thinking your review would be 3-4 stars. Not me. I like and miss this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow...this place is A++++!  Judy was absolutely hands down the BEST server/bartender I have ever met my entire existence.  I had the baby back ribs and they were out of this world.  My friend had the burger and was also very pleased.  Their beer selection was way more than I expected - maybe over 75 bottles to choose from.   Seriously, this is a place I will remember my whole life.  Judy, if you're reading this, you're the best!  Thanks for making us out of towners feel right at home."}
{"text":"Salad bar was small,not many choices,but the ingredients were fresh and tasty. Sirloin burger was ok,bun bigger than the burger,bun was drab,toppings were small and wilted,French fries were sparse and partially raw. Once a bigger party came in,our waitress \"dropped\" us--ignored us. It was my birthday and kind of disappointed with whole experience,won't go back. 13 north should of been my first choice,wanted to try something new...oh well. Definitely nothing special."}
{"text":"Went today for brunch for the first time. I haven't been to Feeny's at all for years, but was pleasantly surprised to find an updated interior while still maintaining the usual charm. We were greeted warmly by Amanda, our server, and seated immediately. The food and drinks were top notch and we will definitely be back again!   The prime rib eggs Benedict were delicious, as was the French toast. Come try this neighborhood hangout!"}
{"text":"The decor immediately catches your eye. It's very inviting, yet with a vintage feel. You definitely feel either a time warp or a country warp. We really liked it. Gave us a free app for checking in on Yelp. I started with the salad bar, then got ribs, a double baked potato and veggies. It was good. The double baked potato was amazing. They brought us a free dessert. The staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean and the prices weren't too high. I would for sure go back."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Feeney's for Sunday brunch...DO! It's a truly delicious selection of Mediterranean cuisine...Cretan Dakos, Tsoureki French Toast...a great iron-skillet vegies frittata with goat cheese and aioli. And the bright and shiny Amanda behind the bar!"}
{"text":"Been here two times now and the second time was better than the first.  Great food and drinks at a great price.    This is a perfect neighborhood bar/restaurant and I have to admit I hate telling you about this spot as I would love to keep it all to myself, but it's so good you all need to try this out."}
{"text":"Decided to celebrate our new Phoenix home by visiting Feeney's. The pork osso bucco was the best I ever had and my husband said the liver and onions was as good as his mom's (very high praise)!   We will definitely be back to this wonderful place. We are looking forward to becoming regulars."}
{"text":"Had the filet medallions.   It was totally delicious!  The service was great as well.  The owner greets everyone like they are old friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Great regulars. Go in on Mondays for the cheap hand ground burgers. The Tenderloin Toast app is awesome!"}
{"text":"I find it very difficult to write this review. I really like to patronize the little guys and the independent restaurants. So to write a bad review for one of them is very difficult. Feeney's has been in central Phoenix for many many years and I really wanted to like it but our experience was so bad, I cannot in good conscience write a good review. My aunt and I decided to go to Fenney's for our monthly girls night dinner. My husband and I had been there a few months ago and did not have a great experience but I really wanted to give them another chance because of their long standing in the community. My aunt and I had an equally bad experience starting with walking into the restaurant and not being greeted by anyone for more than five minutes. We stood at the hostess stand and waited and waited and waited for someone to approach us. I could understand if they were busy but we were probably two of only five people in the entire restaurant. When we were finally approached it was by a young waiter who seemed very unhappy with his job and seemed put out by having to interact with us.  He asked us if we had reservations which was laughable considering there was no one in the restaurant!  When we said no, he hesitated and looked down at the reservation book and then hesitated some more and finally sat us.  My aunt ordered an iced tea with a lime instead of lemon. The woman who took our drink order who I think was one of the owners said that was fine and then promptly brought my aunt and ice tea with a lemon. Seems like a little thing but starting out the evening it seemed like a bad omen. I ordered a glass of Chardonnay which was not delivered and I had to ask again if I could get my glass of wine. We looked over the menu and I asked about the beef Wellington. The owner said she could not make me the beef Wellington because the oven was broken and the pastry would not turn out properly. My aunt and I were confused as to how a restaurant could be operating without a working oven but we proceeded to order steaks.  My steak was good but gorgonzola sauce was not hot and was sort of congealed because it was not hot enough. The steak I ordered as medium and it was delivered very well done. My aunt's fillet mignon was good but the baked potato was overcooked and shriveled on the outside. The salad bar was so sad. There was a small amount of romaine bag-type lettuce in the  lettuce bowl and many of the toppings were empty. There were no tomatoes, no cucumbers, and there were several other containers for toppings that were empty.  We were there at the beginning of the night so I am not sure why the salad bar was so picked over. The service was also horrible. My water glass was never refilled, I was never asked if I wanted another glass of wine, etc.  It was overall not a great experience and we ended up spending over $100 so you would expect at least a minimal effort on the restaurants part. I've given this restaurant two chances and now we will move on to some of the other restaurants that have opened in the central Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Ok so I take my wife here because of the reviews.  First I have to say the area is not that great. Second there are people smoking right by the front door on the patio. Now these things dont really bother me to find a really good food spot but this is not it. What it really is, is a bar with food expensive food that tastes like its from The can not fresh.  I did get a free potato skin appetizer for checking in on yelp. But they were not that great. I really wanted this place to be great I ordered the beef wellington med. rare but it was well done and and the gravy and mushrooms were from a can and it taste just like liver. Wow it was gross.  My wife had the same problem but her meat was at least better than mine.  The Salad bar looked like my middle childs salad bar...Terrible,  that should have been our sign to get out but we didn't.   Though I would say the service is nice. But unfortunately We will not be coming here again.  $90 later! Man i was really wanting a Beef Wellington.  Well looks like i will have to try some place else. Update...20 minutes later I threw up. Man I feel like I have been Gipped!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant at least once a month for the past 6 years. The fish, steak and prime rib dinners at Feeney's are excellent  and include one of the best salad bars I've seen anywhere. A basket of fresh rye and pumpernickle bread and butter is included as well.  The prices are very reasonable and the service is above excellent.. They really want to make sure you're enjoying your meal and have everything you want. The Mudd Pie is incredible and gets 5 starts all by itself."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with family for my birthday and it was awful. Took 10 minutes for someone to come over to get a drink order from us. We were informed she was the bartender and the only one working the whole restaurant, so felt kind of bad. BUT, 30 minutes later we were still waiting for our hummus to come out. Our lunch came out much after that and it was just so so. I had a pasta dish with chicken that was kind of bland, mom had fish and chips which she said were just ok. Burgers looked good. It was just Meh. They would've been better suited having one bartender and one server cuz that wasn't fair for her. Dont even know her name as she never told us, but she was nice."}
{"text":"Don't go if you can't understand the ambiance of a 70's/80's steak house. Do go if you enjoy an old school salad bar, great steaks and lamb and excellent service. This is not The Palm or Del Frisco, not trying to be. Old style and old fashioned friendly service by owner, family and staff. Ribs, and lamb chops, Spanokopita (sp?), twice baked potato and a great salad were our choices. Enjoyed these sitting at the bar and encountered a lovely and very helpful bartender. We plan to return often!!"}
{"text":"Good solid Ma and Pa Restaurant.   I had no idea this Restaurant was here, and highly recommend you try if if you've never gone.  The Atmosphere is quaint, cozy, and great for a date/conversation."}
{"text":"This was the first place my uncle brought me to when I moved to Phoenix. I just retired from the military, from the moment I walked into feenies I felt at home, Maria and Judy have a way of making you feel at home.  I ordered the club sandwich with French fries and a salad bar. The best steak fries and freshly ground pepper with the salad bar I was hooked. As I continued to visit feenies and have become a regular, everyone that works and visits feenies has become my second family. I've explored the menu and it just keeps getting better and better, I've also made some odd requests (gravy and rolls), and George is always there to accommodate my every request.  Amanda  the bartenders joyful spirt is always appriciated. I bring all my friends and family to feenies, and the whole crew always makes everyone feel at home. The new brunch menu is amazing, George is the master mind behind it and he continues to make great progress."}
{"text":"Only thing preventing a 5 star review is that our steaks were slightly overcooked and there's the possibility that the cheese on the salad bar may have been imitation.  My wife and I went here for a quick dinner out after seeing some of the good reviews on yelp and noticing that we could get some free potato skins (Which were by the way excellent).  I had the London broil, and my wife, the fillet mignon. Mine was very rich but hit the spot as it was exactly what I was looking for the time. Than my meat was cooked about the way I wanted it and was very flavorful. My wife's was a little bit overcooked - she asked for it medium and it came out medium well. All meals come with free salad bar and one side. The salad bar was okay, nothing special but had the essentials and it tasted pretty good. The steak fries that my wife had was actually quite delicious (I had vegetables :( ).  The Decour the place is like a classic family eatery/pub. old-school, and I appreciate that. They have daily specials the best of which is five dollars for a burger and fries on Mondays. If I were in the mood for a burger I would've had that; I will definitely go back to try that next time. Our server was named Maria, and from what I can gather she is the owner of the place. She has a thick Greek accent and was incredibly friendly.  All in all it was worth it and we will go back sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Always enjoy it here. The Monday burger special is always good. If we're having drinks we the margaritas."}
{"text":"Feeney's is a great old school neighborhood restaurant. They have awesome specials ($4 Burgers on Mondays, $10 bottles of wine) and the food and ingredients are always good quality.  Last time I was there I had the baby back ribs and they were delicious. Fall off the bone, incredibly moist and the sauce was tangy and yummy.  I love the salad bar, it has canned beets as an option and I think that rocks. It also has garbanzo beans and potato salad.. Yum!   The service is great and they make you feel like family. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you'll feel comfortable. The place you want to go to get away from the chain restaurants. There's a patio/ waiting area. Style is old wood and brick. Take a minute to get a drink at the bar, maybe catch a few minutes of the game. There's an adaquate salad bar included with most meals. I tried the full rack of baby backs, no sauce. I can't be sure, but I think their dry rub has a slightly sweet cinnamon base. Ribs weren't quite fall off the bone or really meaty, but they were tasty. I kept getting that cinnamon finish. Next time I'm trying the Prime rib; talking to regular patrons, they recommended it."}
{"text":"I had a philly cheese steak and my fiance had the beef Wellington ..Both were great. This place is also accommodating to the little ones. They got chicken nuggets."}
{"text":"Amazing. We came for our anniversary and had made a reservation through open table (although reservations are not necessary). In the comment section we put that we were coming for an anniversary and as soon as we walked in we were welcomed they said happy anniversary. It really put a personal touch on our experience. The food and service are top notch and always amazing. We had prime rib and steak  medallions which I am already craving again. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My husband wanted prime rib and he wanted to try something new so I went on yelp to find reviews on steakhouses in our area. I came across Feeney's and they had 4 stars with quite a few reviews so I thought that was a good start. I had never heard of them so I was a bit hesitant since I'm a pretty big foodie and eat out 4-5 times a week. We were game and went for dinner. The ambiance is old and kinda dark but not in a creepy way it had a coziness to it. The greet from what I suspect was the owner was warm and inviting. We ordered wine which they had a nice selection and apps...calamari. The calamari was seasoned well but just a bit greasy. Still a decent start. I ordered salmon and asparagus, the Mr ordered prime rib...I enjoyed my salmon. It was cooked perfectly and seasoned... Hubby said his prime rib was very good also. They had a salad bar that comes with your meal but I shun buffets or any good that is not delivered directly from the kitchem so I passed... but my husband tried it and he ate his whole salad. We ate good, had good service and the price point was very good our meals with wine and an appetizer was $88 so in comparison to most steakhouses that's pretty good. We both said we would go again. Its not fine dining bit definitely solid and a great neighborhood spot. The food was good."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Feeny's and I was excited to try it! It is definitely a dive bar type scene, which is awesome because you can be comfortable and not have to worry about proper dining etiquette    It took a little while to get service in the bar's dining area, however, once we got service, our drinks came promptly. Ordering food took another hot minute and when we got our so told famous prime rib, we were a tad disappointed. My date got the smaller prime rib and I got the biggest option (more protein, right?). I also opted to pay the extra charge for the twice baked potato. While the food was good, my prime rib came out cold. I had to send it back to be reheated because it seemed like I had reheated it in a microwave. When I got the prime rib back, it was hot, juicy, and amazing! Side note, the salad bar was classic, fresh, and awesome!   All-in-all, I would come back, but I wouldn't sit in the bar area and try to enjoy an entree style dinner. The service was exceptionally lacking9' that area. The food was good, but you have to be assertive if your food isn't up to par with the prices they are charging."}
{"text":"Want great food, great drinks, and great people...well then you should be at Feeneys!  This local phoenix staple is a must visit.  The owner is friendly and fun. The food is classic but with a modern twist.  The bartenders are attentive and will quickly learn your favorite libation.  Feeneys is always my go to watering hole for any celebration, great for small groups or large parties."}
{"text":"Other reviews said they had a great salad bar so my  girlfriend and I went there on Mother's Day just for a nice salad. Not sure who felt it was great but we found it looked average and decided to go elsewhere and left. Restaurant looked nice and regular menu a bit pricey so overall we can only comment on the looks of their salad bar. Go to Ruby Tuesday if you only want a well stocked salad bar for decent money."}
{"text":"I have been here on several occassions.  Most for the Monday night special $4 hamburger which is one of the best I have tasted.  Quality meat. They have specials every night and mostly the same things.  I had the prime rib special one night but nothing to write home about., Salad bar is good but not great.  Not, a lot of choices, just average items. Small semi private dining areas with about 6 to 8 tables in each. Bar area which also has an area of dining tables.  Be sure if you sit at the bar to ask if the seat is reserved as there are locals who come in and if  you are sitting in their seat will let  you know."}
{"text":"Secret of the neighborhood   Friendly staff***** great prime rib***** Salad Bar***** great value******  Great classic Steak place recommend *************************************"}
{"text":"Loved my NY steak but you won't if you don't like garlic. Heavily seasoned.  My friends prime rib was so fatty he only ate about a third of it.  Service was very friendly but our table was  so near the bar it ruined our experience.  Paid way too much for dinner to have to listen to a bar full of local dudes watching football.  Finally, I was actually excited for the salad bar. It has been a long time since I've been to a restaurant that actually still has a salad bar. It was unimpressive."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good steak dinner while visiting from out of town and we found this little gem.  Food and service were both fantastic.  Great prime rib!  Very casual, comfortable environment.  We will return."}
{"text":"Excellent and quick service. Check I. For the first time and they give you free potato skins.   I had the Greek salmon. It was the best I have ever had. Salad bar + baked potato and huge portion of salmon for $20.00.   Even got a visit from Mr and Mrs Santa Claus."}
{"text":"This place was old school when it old school was in session.  I can't spot any changes since it was one of the original Cork N' Cleavers - maybe new carpet, but that may be it.  The salad bar is so old school, it still has jello - not jello shots - jello.  And since, I'm old school, I'm a fan of the salad bar.  Monday 4 buck burgers with 2.50 salad bar is the only food you'll require for the whole day.  Decent burger too.  Good barkeeps - they remember your name or call you hon (old school).  The food is pretty basic, but they start with decent ingredients and prepare them well.  Had the prime rib a couple of weeks ago and my view is that the only way to eat prime rib is to have it breath it's last on the way from the kitchen to the table.  It was early enough in the evening that they were able to deliver a tasty hunk of meat that was as requested.  If you're into modern, contempo kinds of joints, Feeney's won't be for you - but if you're in the mood for dark, old school, slightly seedy (in a good way) - then Feeney's  might just fit the bill."}
{"text":"Had the Envious Passion, and was duly impressed.  The salad bar was nice and fresh, and well stocked.  The London Broiled was tender and delicious, the au jus was very savory.  I had a wonderful time, and would love to return."}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough!!! Best food I've had in ages!!! Hospitality is out of this world.  Would recommend this to anyone.  Fall off the beaten path and try this place out!"}
{"text":"I came to Feeney's looking for steak with my family. I ended up ordering the lamb chops which did not disappoint. However, I finished off the remains of a teriyaki steak, and loved every bite. The mashed potatoes were tasty, and the gravy was excellent. The salad bar at Feeney's was a pleasant surprise that both I and my family enjoyed. If you're looking for a Greek restaurant, Feeney's is the place to go."}
{"text":"Confession - I am remiss in writing this review.  Feeney's great meal and service was an excellent compliment to a great evening with friends!  You see, this raucous bunch took the place over on a Saturday night and while we were by far the loudest table they didn't mind a bit.  From @AZvern to @audreyrlwyatt to @TheDottsyZ to @ThomasWSmith to @lupnacca to @chrissyP71 to @cutepup8191 we all had a great time and enjoyed the old school food and service very much."}
{"text":"Will not go back.  Too noisy. Food not cooked all the way. Site is to Review. Correct it, Do not remove it."}
{"text":"great food, great atmosphere, great service!! if your in Phoenix you must eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Love the live music. Seems like a good place to just hang out and have drinks with your friends.  Service: pretty good. The staff were very friendly.  Food: I had the Salisbury steak. It was alright. I should've gotten the prime rib!  Tip: Don't forget to check in on Yelp for free potato skins!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular. A nice Greek family owns the place. They remember me and treat my family and guests like royalty.  I stopped by near closing one night after taking the kids to look at Christmas lights. To my surprise they made a couple of phone calls and next thing you know, Santa Claus was at my table.  5 stars for service. 4 stars because food quality has been inconsistent. Never bad, but one of their chefs is hands down better than the others."}
{"text":"I am SO HAPPY we found this place! Thank you yelp! There are definitely some pros and definitely some cons. Let's start with the pros. We made a reservation and they had it ready when we arrived. House red wine is really good Daily specials-fish and chips and chicken-yummy Twice baked potatoes very good  Calamari excellent Jello on the salad bar-yes please! Waitress Judy was super friendly even though she was swamped Homemade mud pie from Maria Prime rib tasted awesome Cold plates for salad-super important!! Better next time Moldy cucumbers in the salad bar Prime rib had too much fat-yucky!! Ran out of ribs Overall we had a great experience! It seemed as if most of the people in there were regulars which also made for a fun time. The place seemed very Midwestern to me, almost like a supper club or something like that. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place rocks...it's simply the best neighborhood bar, with the greatest old timers hanging out there. I always enjoy my food, my drinks and the company - no one drinks alone here.  Where else can you find a salad bar from the 70's still up and functioning with bacon bits...  There is a great burger deal on Tuesdays (I think) and they ahve a neat little patio with a TV."}
{"text":"Oh yeah. Now we are talking.   This place is so old-school every time I go there I feel like I should be driving an Olds Toronado and wearing a Jantzen Shirt-Jac. I want to travel back in time and show up with Angie Dickinson on my arm and smoke a fat cigar in their bar while calling the waitress \"sugar\". I walk through the front door and suddenly it's 1972.  And yes, these are good things.  The ceilings are low, there are no windows to speak of, and the the brick arches inside recall something like a German rathskeller.  Along with more modern dishes, the menu features old delights like Osso Bucco, Liver and Onions, and Beef Wellington. At the salad bar  you load up your pewter plate with julienned carrots among other things under a generic \"Salad Bar\" sign that probably came out of a Sysco catalog 30 years ago. Just behind the salad bar is the grill, steaming away under a large copper canopy. Watch and smell those delectable slabs of meat give up their aroma. An offering to the gods of polyester, Johnny Carson, and the man who reads Playboy.  The martinis are adequate, though not killer. Actually they are probably made the same way they were back when the place opened in 1965. It's only recently that \"superpremium\" ingredients have raised the standard to lofty heights.  On my most recent visit I had the grilled salmon-shrimp special which came with a couple of asparagus spears, a lemony-butter sauce, a few shrimp and steamed veggies for $21. Hey, as much as I fantasize I need to remember it's not 1972 anymore. Thanks to modern technology I know what my arteries look like. Though the flavors were good, I felt that both the salmon and the shrimp were both a little over-cooked. Overcooked shrimp are safe but rather tasteless. The sauce helped compensate, and the overall effect was satisfying.  I looked longingly at my companion's prime rib, which was delivered exactly as ordered: Medium rare. The prime rib is the star of the show in a joint like this.  There are nightly specials during the week that look like good values.  Though I wouldn't change a thing about the decor, they do need to look after bathroom maintenance a bit, and some background music would be nice.  I plan to return regularly to soak in that 70's flavor. I need to find some white shoes and a matching belt."}
{"text":"Excellent Service!!! Excellent Food!!! Great little hide-a-way that's not your typical cookie cutter restaurant. Great salad bar warm bread and very good prices!  The porkchops are some of the best in the city. Great ambience.  The owner Maria does a fantastic job!"}
{"text":"I rarely do reviews but I felt like this little gem deserved some recognition! We chose to come in based off the prime rib reviews- it definitely lived up to the hype. It was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. But my favorite part of the meal was meeting the employees. We met three of them- each were personable and took time to ask about and interact with our baby girl. It is obvious that their customers mean a lot to them. They were so warm and welcoming. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a fun time here at Dottsy's UYE here.  Good cheap beer and burgers, on a Monday, and friendly service."}
{"text":"We showed up after my graduation as a party of 9 at 5:30pm on a Friday night with no reservation. They quickly accommodated us.  Everything we had was excellent. The ribeye was the best I've ever had. The prime rib was delicious. The chicken picatta was good. My son got a kids burger that was great. My daughter got the linguini with marinara and loved it. The twice. Asked potato would have been better with bacon, but were fantastic as served. The salad bar was fresh and the clam chowder decadent.   The menu said they add gratuity to parties of six or more, however they did not add gratuity, so we tipped them even better. This was an exceptional experience. We aren't local but next time we are back in Phoenix will will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Service and food were fantastic! Drinks from the bar were made well, Beef Wellington was to die for. My son had the lamb chops - also very good. My other son had a burger that he couldn't finish (very big portion)! We were too full for dessert but I did see a few go by and they looked awesome. Next time I won't stuff the whole Wellington down and I'll save room for dessert! Salad bar is good, there's a nice variety of appetizers and entrees, and even a variety of sides if you're not in the \"full dinner\" mode. They have specials during the week, too.   I'll definitely hit them up again soon!"}
{"text":"It was our first time I loved it. Judy is so nice and funny. Food is delicious. Atmosphere is nice and quiet for early dinner. We got prime rib and it's one of the best one. Salad bar is a nice addition"}
{"text":"Brought two newbies with me this time. As always great service coupled with great food. Prime rib was perfect with the baked potato prepared with slight crunch to skin. One diner said best prime rib in the valley. The other dining partner commented that the filet was perfectly cooked and would be back for another visit... Two new patrons .. Thx Feeney's"}
{"text":"Great little spot ! I would of never ever thought of walking in here. But the reviews made me want to try it out . Great service as soon as you walk in the door, your greeted walked to a table . Prices are reasonable. I only had appetizers but the where  tasty ! If your near by stop by give it a try ."}
{"text":"Really bad truck stop salad bar and the quality of food not good, beef Wellington over cooked meat and doughy pastry"}
{"text":"Old school yo!  We're talking salad bar with beets, sunflower seeds and cottage cheese yo!  We're talking prime rib of Flintstonian proportions!   I met a group of good friends here recently. We were seated in a back (non window) room and my claustrophobia almost got the best of me. It was a pretty tiny room. Soon I decided it wasn't tiny. It was cozy. And soon the Coronas were a- comin' and the conversation was flowing.  Our server, a delightful woman, was efficient and friendly. And a shout out to her just for handling a group of a dozen or so yelpers! Can you imagine waiting on us lol!?!?  My prime rib and baked potato were pure perfection. The salad bar was fresh and fully loaded.   Much like myself towards the end of the evening.  The decor is all muraled-out if memory serves me. So there's a lot going on!   So Feeney's you got a new fan! Great place to take my folks, out of towners or anyone I think is worthy of the Feeney charm!!!  Yo!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and have had many items on the menu except for the steaks.  I hear the steaks are really good by the way.  I like the old school look to this place.  Feels very comfortable.  There is a nice bar area by the front and a few rooms for dining plus a salad bar that is pretty well stocked.  Service is always good.  I have never had to ask for a server to come by.  This place is always busy for dinner, a couple of times I could not even find parking.  My last visit I was able to park close to the door.  I ate at the bar once at that was nice too.  I had the trout but for some reason it was not as good as other places I've had the trout.  I also had the Osso Bucco, $22.95, and is was pretty good but was missing a little something.  I had broccoli as a side and even though it was bright green, it was somewhat tough.  The Chicken Picatta, $18.95 was kind of a disappointment.  The chicken breast is supposed to be pounded but was not which often makes the breast dry.   It makes such a big difference I don't know why some places are not wiling to pound the breast this as it should be for many of these Italian style chicken.  I would not recommend this dish or the Chicken Marsala because it also should be pounded. (check out any receipe online).   I should probably try the steak because this is a steak place after all.  If you live in the area this place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I always get amazing service here. Staff is so nice and accommodating. They make a special order for me every time and it is the best thing ever considering I'm picky. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Nice quaint little restaurant. Nothing major negative to say but overall it was not what I was hoping for in a quality restaurant. If you are going to price like an upscale steakhouse then you should deliver like an upscale steakhouse. This was really nothing more than a nice neighborhood restaurant. Would not return."}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant with great service. Fun, local atmosphere and family-like staff after just a few visits. Feeney's Steak Salad for life!"}
{"text":"A group of three of us went on a Wednesday night for the first time.  I ordered the salisbury steak (one of the Wednesday $10 specials) and it was fantastic.  It was thick and juicy and topped with a wonderful mushroom gravy.  The mashed potatoes were homemade and very, very good.  The meal came with the salad bar which was nicely stocked with fresh items.  It wasn't a large salad bar, but it was perfect for a pre-meal salad.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  She had a lovely accent (Russian maybe?) and made sure we never ran out of beer.  Overall, it was a fun experience and we'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This neighborhood restaurant/bar is so excitingly unusual in Phoenix. The food is delicious (definitely try the prime rib), andthe service is unrivaled. This is a family-run throwback to pre-chain takeovers. The salad bar is crisp and fresh. The crowd is friendly. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"The burgers are great. The decor is definitely old school, but the waitstaff are friendly."}
{"text":"A hidden gem situated in Uptown Phoenix, the owners couldn't be any nicer. Great steak house cooking up all your favorites like ribeye, prime rib and fish dishes. When we stop in we're greated by the owner who gives us a big hug, it's like going to Mom's steak house. I've been eating here for years, so it was about time I posted a review. Hope to see you here!!!"}
{"text":"My fIrst dining experience at Feeney's. We had lunch. After reading reviews I opted for 8 oz prime rib served with potato or rice side and soup or salad. I chose mashed potatoes with gravy and salad bar.  Salad bar included fresh lettuce beets, garbanzo beans, carrots and cucumbers, black olives, red onion, etc. etc. served on a frozen pewter salad plate. yum!  Homemade coleslaw, potato and macaroni salads too. Salad dressings are all homemade. Blue cheese dressing was so delicious. The prime rib was an excellent piece of meat in every way--flavorful and tender.  The owner Maria, served us and she is extremely cordial. Looking forward to bringing my husband with me next time."}
{"text":"I went here last weekend with the BF's parents to see if we would like to have our rehearsal dinner here. When we first walked in, I wasn't 100% convinced because this place is old school....like what I remember a sizzler or something looking like in the 90's. The place is dark and it has an old school salad bar.... need I say more? But this place really surprised me with their excellent service and food. We started with apps (which is totally unnecessary because the portions here are out of control). We had the spinach dip and the potato skins....it was good, but typical bar food. I also had a couple mimosas because they were on special for 1$....heck yes! We then got our soup/salad bar. I had the soup and it was good, nothing terribly special, but not bad. Then the (humongous) entrees....I had the lamb chops and they were delicious! They were perfectly cooked and seasoned....super juicy, they reminded me of eating lamb chops at home as a kid....definitely delicious. The BF had the new york strip which was equally good. He got it medium well, and they managed to keep it moist and juicy....awesome! We all got twice baked potatoes with our meals, which were very good (how can potato and cheese and bacon and whatnot be bad?). We finished with mud pie, which was ok, but nothing special. Anyway, at the end of the meal (while I was sitting there dying of stuffedosity) the owner came over and spent the time to chat with us about how our party was going to be set up and what the room would look like. I liked how friendly and accommodating the owner was. We are planning to have our rehearsal dinner, so I will update after that! Definitely check this hidden treasure out!"}
{"text":"Judy!! Judy! Judy! Ok let me start with I LOVE their salad bar, simple and perfect. Happy hour is great. Their Prime Rib...the best. Honestly it's all great. Judy is the best! Remembers my likes, dislikes and just the nicest person ever. As much as I love the food here, Judy is the driving force for me each week!"}
{"text":"Love that is the same, haven't been here in years, excellent. Had the ribeye. This app is pissing me off forcing me to write more than I wanted to"}
{"text":"2nd time to Feeney's  fabulous, brought friends for a celebration. Prime rib superb, trout fabulous. Even though its a ride from Scottsdale  definitely worth it.                                 Barbra & Ronnie Gradozzi"}
{"text":"We went here for my husband's birthday on a Friday.  Got here around 5:30.  The place wasn't packed and we had a comfortable corner table.  The restaurant is clean and inviting.  We were immediately greeted as we walked in.  If there is one place I have ever reviewed that takes the cake for best service, it's definitely Feeney's!  For starters we had their amazing potato skins.  I could tell just with the appetizer that we were in for a treat with our meal.  The potato skins were meaty and crispy and crunchy and so on point! They were so generous with their sour cream too!   On to the main course!  Two words.  Beef.  Wellington.  Now I'm sure you've heard of Gordon Ramsay and his famous beef Wellington.  I had the opportunity to try Ramsay's version at his Vegas restaurant.  Feeney's version is very comparable in quality and a much, much more economical version.  The beef was so tender and heavenly.  If I had to make just one comment, it would be that the sherry reduction was a tad saltier than it needed to be. However, don't let this deter you from ordering this dish.  The sauce is more of a garnish than a necessity to the dish.  My husband ordered the prime rib.  I would have loved to eat more of his steak too, but I was beyond full by the time     he even thought to offer me any lol!  If you're looking for a low key date night (or any night) check out Feeney's.  Just be prepared to add them to your list of local favorites."}
{"text":"I have never been here before and my wife decided to take me here for my birthday dinner. I have always wanted to try Beef Wellington ever since I seen it cooked on Hells Kitchen.. And they didn't disappoint. The Wellington was cooked perfectly and the sauce was very flavorful. I would definitely come here again for dinner. A +++ service a nice quiet atmosphere on Sunday perfect for a couple having a quiet romantic dinner."}
{"text":"This little gem just got better with the upgrades they have brought Feeney's into this century with class. The food is still very good and done well to each customer's preference. They have some unique items other places do not. It is the best service and we love the owners and staff."}
{"text":"Had fantastic meal here.  The wife and I both ordered the Beef Wellington.  It was outstanding.  The outer pastry was light and flaky and delicious.  The meat was cooked perfectly as well!! Pricey but worth it.  From the outside it is rather nondescript, but the owners and staff were very friendly.  Inside it was nice, good decorum and a large wine list to choose from.  Salad bar was just o.k. Overall I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night it was fabulous. The service here is just phenomenal. They came to fill my drink before it was empty SEVERAL times. From the moment we walked in the door it felt like they wanted us to be there. We will be back for sure.   The prime rib was perfect!"}
{"text":"Back for meal two...salisbury steak..on special  and really good!!  This place is sooo awesome.  Great ambiance..amazing beer selection and always great and friendly service!! Will be back"}
{"text":"I love Feeney's.  The place is the best kept secret in Phoenix.  I'm bringing the family here next time they visit."}
{"text":"best of the best,  a Phoenix landmark, great food, great service, great reasonable house wine, why go anywhere else?  Love the place, warm, comfortable surroundings, like going back to the good all days.  Everyone seems to know you, even if you have not been back for a year.."}
{"text":"Great place, very friendly and welcoming, excellent food.  Frankly it is one of my favorite steak houses in town, in part because the quality of the meat is excellent and the price is reasonable.  The decor is rustic and reminds me of the steak houses my dad loved when I was a kid.  You pay for good food and excellent service, not for glitz.  That's just how I like it."}
{"text":"It was clean and quiet and my mother's walleye was very good, my Shepard's pie was alright but my wife's liver and onions was the worse she's ever had.  Also there was no bread or anything and it took probably 20-40 for our meals to arrive and they did no one came to check on us.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place encapsulates everything good about grassroots family-owned dinning. Amazing service, awesome food, very cool atmosphere. Total pride and ownership from the family, at point. Prime Rib was thick and plentious, way I like 'em! ;) salad bar was very good. Great experience all around."}
{"text":"Dark lighting and old school charm interior.  Decent food for take out; lacks presentation but again, this was a 'to go' order. We ordered the Beef Wellington which was good. This is not a high-end restaurant so factor that in when giving it a try. Salad bar had many options and salad items were fresh. Staff was nice and our food was ready to go when we arrived."}
{"text":"Delicious food the service is a little slow or they would get 5 stars...but its not stopping me from going back. Its close to my house and well worth the price."}
{"text":"I love this place! This is one of the best steaks I have had in Arizona. Perfectly cooked. I will keep going back here"}
{"text":"Great almond trout!  Get family run business feel and vibe.  Awesome place for a group dinner or place to grab a drink."}
{"text":"This place looks like they haven't changed anything since 1955. It's the kind of steakhouse my grandfather would have loved. They do all the classics really really well. The beef wellington is exceptional."}
{"text":"i'm feelin' a feeney. ya know what i mean? prolly not. but thats ok.  Feeney's is just a cool spot on the travels of my life. one of my favorites bartenders from Hanratty's works here now, Whats up Chrystal..we gotta do brunch soon. :)  Feeney's has a bomb patty melt. i love patty melts. greasy, cheesy, burgery and oniony. yep check all four things on the list. definetly something to check out if your in the area. awesomeness lives here. it's pure WIN...trust me."}
