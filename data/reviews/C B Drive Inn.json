{"text":"Been coming here forever, went there today and was a little underwhelmed by the burger...  if you get cheese on a burger, it should at least be partially melted, not thrown on after the fact.  fries were awesome as per usual."}
{"text":"Friends who live in the neighbourhood suggested I try CB Drive Inn, a little retro burger joint in the northwest. So I trucked all the way up here, quite excited for a great burger.  What I got was fair, fairly priced, and fairly decent.     
I ordered the cheeseburger special, which came with fries and a slushie for $6.25 with tax. The burger came within 2 minutes of placing my order, which may explain why the cheese wasn't melted on it. I would rate the burger as satisfactory, but that's about it. I can't say it was tasty per se, but it filled the void. The crinkle cut fries were, well, crinkle cut fries. I can make the same ones at home by way of McCain superfries. The slushie was small, but a nice option. 
This place would be nice in the summer, as they have picnic tables out front under an overhang for you to eat your pick-up only fast food and maybe have a shake with it. 
They sure have an eclectic menu. Really? Do we still need to have pizza pops on the menu in this day and age? Really? And zucchini sticks? I always think it's best to focus on a few items and do them well, so CB Drive Inn needs to focus a little more on their burgers."}
{"text":"See & Be C B - Drive ins, are a classic and a lost art! CB is reflective of a bygone era. With a decent selection of drive in fare, in a maintained and somewhat nostalgic setting, operated with familial flair, and with a steady stream of students from the nearby schools, you're assured of getting your order quick and fresh! Affordable, simple, and tasty, as fast food should be. All it's missing, are waitresses on roller skates."}
{"text":"Better then McDonald, and nice priced, i  have enjoyed the burgers here in the past and have always had a great experience,  for the price it is a better  choice the other fast food places, my kids loved the fries they were just crippler cut, but deep fried to perfection and then hit with season salt when still hot!!  that was good"}
{"text":"It used to be great for both the quality of the food and price.  

Now the hamburgers seem smaller/cheaper, missing their relished-based burgers from years past, get charged for Interac, plus $10.15 is too much to pay for a Master burger combo with small fries and small drink."}
{"text":"when I was 18 and 140 lbs I used to eat a Monster (4 patty) burger and two orders of fries. 
now i eat one Master and one order of fries. Great hangover meal for the price."}
{"text":"I can't comment how good any of their food is other than their very good crinkle cut fries.  That is all I can think about when I visit them in their location which once was a long, long time ago a A&W.  

You can ask for them to cook the fries extra crispy as well."}
{"text":"Love this place, lived on it for a few years while living in Brentwood."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was little with my parents. The place is wonderful, and so are the people that run it.

BEST fries in town :)"}
{"text":"When I think of Calgary independent food venues, I think of Peters and CB. The burgers are messy and delicious and the staff easily sees more people on a Sunday than I've met in my life and yet treat everyone special. The fries are to die for."}
{"text":"A small family owned fast burger joint. Very friendly and nice owners. 

Burgers are pretty average and just as good as the other well known burger places like Angels drive thru or peters drive thru. I really like their crinkle fries because its different then most places. 

Lots of parking and a good place to try."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for fries while driving home, and boyfriend suggested his childhood favorite - C B's.

This place is set up like an old school drive in, cover car ports were lined out front - for a second I thought someone in roller-skates was going to come and take our order lol

We decided to split a meal (cheese burger with fries and a pop for $8, pretty sweet deal). The Korean family who own this place are very animated and entertaining!

I read over their menu as I waited for our food - multitude of milkshakes flavors, their different sizes of burgers (single, double, master and MONSTER - 4 patties!) and random goodies that would appeal to any kid at the school next door (pizza pops, corn dogs and deep fried pretty much anything)

It was a bit cold out so we opted to eat in the car instead of the picnic bench outside. The crinkle cut fries were great - crispy and sprinkled with seasoning salt. The cheeseburger was pretty good, meat was juicy and flavorful.

I'm looking forward to the weather to warm us so we can come back to C B's for a milk shake and some more of their delicious fries."}
{"text":"Awesome milkshakes. I like the old style drive-inns. Pretty much exactly what you would expect. Lots of deep fried deliriousness and all your canteen basics."}
{"text":"Not the best but not the worst.  I had a regular burger and it was tasty but I opted for poutine and I won't do that again.  The gravy was gluey and there was a simple sprinkling of marble cheddar on top.  The fries were delish though...next time I'll skip the extra calories and comfort."}
{"text":"I really don't know how this place gets any good ratings at all.
Being hungry and in the area, we thought it would be a good place to grab some lunch.
Bad choice...
First of all, the place is kind of dirty looking, especially looking at the dust, grease, and grime on the overhead lighting.  It's a kitchen, and should be spotless top to bottom.  As for the food, it was seriously poor. The burger just tasted weird, the fries are basically just your garden variety frozen crinkle cuts, the onion rings are nothing special and very greasy, and the shakes are kind of weak, and don't seem to be made from actual ice cream.
Even the ketchup is some off brand rather than brand name.
There are much better burger joints in town, at that includes all the chains.  Save your money and go to any other joint instead."}
{"text":"Disappointed today, don't know when they down sized the pattie size but if you are going to do it you should down size the buns at the same time, at least 3/8 of an inch if not 1/2 an inch of bun around the Pattie had to pick off the excess to get to the meat, even noticed the amount of seasoning spice on the fries was less than usual. He has got to start including napkins in the bag as I only got two because I asked for catsup there was none in the bag before that. Place is always busy so I don't know why you would cut back on the product, a small raise in prices would not keep me from coming back but after today it may be a while, which is to bad as I have been there at least once a month since 1979."}
{"text":"This place is lovely. Good food and even better people behind the counter! The friendly staff/owners remember us after having been there a couple of times, and are always making jokes and having a good time - a very welcoming environment! 

The shakes are from a machine, not 'real' ice cream, but still very tasty (not as good as Boogie's, but on par with Peter's). The fries are awesome - eat them right away 'cause they're best warm! My favorite thing to order is the deep fried mushrooms - little blobs of goodness with ranch dressing for dipping... mmm! 

This classic joint should not be missed - great to take-away or to sit and enjoy if the weather is warm enough for a picnic table under the awning."}
{"text":"Kind of like a Peter's Drive-In style but better.
Old school, walk in or drive thru. Delicious burgers, even when eaten cold. My fave part of the burger here is the BUN. Soft and fresh complete with sesame seeds - sooo good!
The service was fast and friendly, the menu very self explanatory and CHEAP! The staff are on the ball. The person at the til will yell out omissions or additions to the burger to the grill-man, no fancy computer systems here.
One staff member was constantly cleaning the fry oil with his mesh spoon. Good to see.
If you are hungry, go for a double patty at least (you can go up to quadruple patties, accckkkk!) but the single was enough for me. Next time we will indulge in some fries or onion rings.
1 pop, 2 burgers = $7 and change. I saw a combo on the board for a single burger, fry or onion ring and a pop, $3.50.
:)"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and both times I have left disappointed. The service has been nice and friendly, but the food is not very good and not worth the money. 

The burgers were super overcooked and dry. It was as if the patties had been sitting on a grill for too long, and they were way too small for the buns. The cheese was a cold kraft single. For the price, you're better off going somewhere like Peter's. 

The regular fries are okay - they're just frozen McCain crinkle cut, but they were fresh and hot with a nice seasoning spice on them, though a bit dry. However, I seriously would recommend staying away from the chilli cheese fries - covered in gross nacho cheese and left me feeling really bad in my stomach."}
{"text":"Went after not having been in a year or so. Grew up with this place, and they always had juicy burgers and the best fries. 

Very disappointed today as the meat patties have shrunk in size substantially. The burger was mostly bun and the patties were dry. 

The staff are still the same, so nice and great service, too bad the burger quality has gone after more than 25 years of eating there."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely my last. Owner argued with me after I noticed my burger was wrong, I doubled checked twice that I was getting two double cheese burgers, one with bacon as I was paying. My second cheeseburger didn't even have cheese so I didn't want to go back and argue with him. He was making it sound like it was my fault even after I left him a tip. The burgers were dry and cheap on toppings. Milk shakes were good and so were the onion rings. The fries were way too salty. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Good burgers and best fries ever.  Very reasonable prices and everything very fresh and done to order.  Owners Korean John Wayne mannerisms are also hilarious!"}
{"text":"CB is a great family-owned place tucked away beside a small strip mall near the intersection of 14th St. NW and Northmount Drive.  Their claim to fame are their deliciously fresh, crispy, seasoned crinkle cut fries!   The burgers are okay (the bacon cheeseburger is my favourite; the fish burger is a bit plain and soggy though).  The milk shakes(available in small, medium, and large) are deliciously satisfying and thick, although they are smaller than the ones from Peter's Drive In.     They also have poutine (which I haven't tried yet), chicken burgers, and fish and chips. The service is friendly and efficient, just drop in and say \"Ah nyaw ha say o\"!   There are picnic benches available outside for you to enjoy your burger feast."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Got the chicken fingers combo and deep-fried mushrooms. The chicken fingers were frozen, and were served raw. I brought them back and they made me a new order. This time they were tiny and over-cooked. The fries were frozen McCain crinkle cut. Drinks don't come with the combo so I had to pay extra for that and it was very watered down. The deep-fried mushrooms were home made but very bland. I ate there outside and when a couple wasps got very curious about my food I just got up and left it to them. My lousy meal came to almost $17."}
{"text":"The burgers are OK, but the fries are really good: better, in fact, than at many fast-food places. Secret: they're seasoned, so you don't need to put ketchup on them. The shakes aren't as large as those from Peter's Drive-In, but for the price they're reasonable. Note: I don't order through the drive-through window, I park and then walk in and order at the counter. That way, I can be entertained by photos of other customers, taken by the owners."}
{"text":"CB Drive in is what legends are made of. I recently re-visited this gem after probably 10 or even more years away.  This is the epitome of a genuine and original drive in. It still has the parking stalls with a covered picnic area, which resembles the original burger joints of the 50's and 60's.

This place is still run my the same family after all of these years and the value and quality is also still as good as ever.

Now, why go to CB's you might ask? It does look like a classic dive burger joint on the edge of a strip mall that you would want to avoid, but that's exactly why you should go! Places like this don't stay alive because they serve crappy food. This place has the best French fries in the city!!! They are the classic 'crinkle' cut with a secret seasoning spice on it, served in a paper bag and overflowing! The personal size feeds 2 comfortably and the family size is beyond huge!

Their burgers are also not to be downplayed. They are made as they are ordered and always is made with fresh and crispy veggies!

To put the final icing on the cake, they don't just offer pop for drink options on the combo, they also have slushies! Year round!!

I highly recommend you go here for a great traditional burger joint or a special spot for a hangover meal!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to CB in my olden Calgary days... maybe about 5 years ago. The introduction came from a Mexican guy I worked with. He wasn't afraid of trying just about any greasy spoon or hole-in-the-wall. \"You should see the food carts I eat from back in Mexico,\" was his typically reply.

Thankfully, there's nothing sketchy about CBs. They're out in the open on Northmount Drive, the picnic tables, though they could use a bit of a paint job, are in good condition, and the area itself is surrounded by families, houses and big trees. 

During my most recent visit I ordered a mushroom burger with regular fries and a small (not the extra small, they've got four sizes of drink) root beer. My total? $7.09 including GST. Holy schnikes! That's cheap. And pretty good food too. The burger is not the best I've had in Calgary. I was watching the patties go through the broiler, and frankly, they're a little thin. But, all burgers come with some basic toppings like pickles, mayo, lettuce and onions and the basic burger starts at like $2.60 I think. Add-ons go up from there.

The best part of CBs for me (and for them because it says so on the paper sleeve) are the fries. The crinkle cut fries remind me of The McCain Fry kid... you know the kid, the \"strong silent type\" one concentrated on putting the best amount o ketchup on his super fries? Except these ones are seasoned and I don't have to cook them, which makes them taste even better."}
{"text":"heard about their yummy poutine so had to try.
SOOOO goood! hahaha.
crinkle cut fries which i LOVE!!!  oooey goooey cheese with gravy.
tasted delish.  would come back for their poutine.

burger was meh... wouldn't eat the burger again.... got the mushroom swiss.. and the swiss was the kind of process swiss from superstore...

benches around for you to sit and eat.
mom and pop shop that's set up like peters drive inn."}
{"text":"Not much excites me about this place. Tried the fish burger and it was OK. Wasn't overly memorable. Similar to Peter's  Drive-In, I think this is more a place built on memories than merit. Crinkle cut Fries are tasty and addictive. My son had chicken fingers and said they were fine. I would not discourage anyone from trying but I'd certainly only stop in for convenience if I was in the area and needed a quick bite."}
{"text":"I've got a soft spot for independent burger joints. That soft spot is my stomach.
 
This place is just bursting with character and they make a mean box of fries. Their burgers are, in my opinion, more delicious than Peter's - mostly because you don't feel like your burger was cranked out by disgruntled Eastern European women.

The owners here are a joy. They've got pictures of customers all over the walls and I've never been there without them cracking some sort of joke or messing with me at the till. Like, deliberately ringing in my order wrong and then making a joke about how I owed him 10,000 dollars. Pay for the food, stay for the comedy! As Cory put it, the \"Korean Guy\" who runs this place is a legend and before you know it, you'll be wishing he picked YOU to take a picture with and put it on his wall.

If you're really lucky, maybe he will.

Now, the fries.
Ho-ly-mo-ley.

They come in a cardboard box and they look like the ones you can buy from the grocery store. They probably are. But there's so much Korean love baked into these beauties that you're going to make awkward moaning noises the first time you try them, I can almost guarantee it.

Burgers are pretty standard but they feel \"cleaner\" than other joints. Shredded lettuce, flavorful patties, cheese.. ah, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

Either way, this is fast food burgers done right. This is community done right. Ah, little Korean man and your little burger drive thru, I'm coming to see you tomorrow despite a massive snowfall warning. Keep the grill warm for me."}
{"text":"After a long afternoon running around, completing errands I was really craving a burger.  Not a sit down in the restaurant kind of deal, just a fast one.  I didn't want to hit up a typical fast food joint so I turned to my handy dandy Yelp app.  C B Drive Inn appeared amongst other places but it was on my way home so I decided to try this place out.  

The parking lot is a good size and of course they have a drive through.  I decided to park and go inside the little retro joint to order.  When I walked in, the menu is hanging in the back and it appears to be a little family run business.  They offer burgers (beef and chicken), fries, hot dogs, onion rings, zuchinni sticks, chili, milkshakes, slushes and combos for a special price.  I decided to go with the regular single burger and a poutine.  The prices are very reasonable...honestly I forget the exact amount I paid but I think it was around $7-8, not expensive at all.  I took my order to go and ate at home.  The burger is small, similar to Peter's Drive Inn single burgers.  They use processed cheese, tomato, lettuce..nothing out of the ordinary for a burger.  I found it didn't have much taste but it wasn't bad either.  The poutine was delightful with mozzarella cheese in a small styrofoam container.  The gravy melted the cheese but the fries weren't as crispy as I had wished.  Maybe next time I will take advantage of the seats they have outside!

I would recommend C B Drive Inn if you wanted something quick and inexpensive for a fast eat!"}
{"text":"One of the only places I know where you can get fried mushrooms, my favourite!
And they have the hard to find rum and butter milkshake. 
The food is your normal drive thru burger joint stuff but I really enjoy it. It's one of those oldie but goodie things with nostalgia. And I love supporting mom & pop establishments like this. 
They only take cash or debit!"}
{"text":"Good ol' C B Drive Inn.  Over the years, they have provided me with numerous burgers and fries, as well as shakes and poutine.  This place was a daily favourite of mine.  It's comparable to Peter's Drive Inn, minus the giant parking lot for eating, and the huge maze you take to get to the order window.

Okay, the burgers they make might be on the messier side, and their fries definitely have too much of that seasoning salt on them, but it's delicious and addictive nonetheless.

I particularly love the guys that work here.  One man in particular was extremely funny every time.  He would always talk with a weird, deep voice and make me laugh instantly upon entry.  They give you your food quickly, but everything is still fresh.

The prices aren't ridiculous or anything, but you might be paying a little more than if you were to go to McDonald's or Wendy's or somewhere like that, but the food is waaay better.

Sadly, though, C B seems to always have a lot of high school and junior high kids surrounding the place, since there are two schools just down the street.  Still, even with the mass amount of youngins, C B is still a favourite burger joint of mine."}
{"text":"CB is a classic little joint.

It reminds me of so many  of the little ice cream or fried food shacks in midwestern USA.

The prices?
Good!
The guy who was working the counter (possible the owner?)?
Awesome.
The names of the burgers? 
Hilarious (a double burger is a \"master burger\" and a triple is a \"centenial?\" What the??).

The burgers taste like a burger you would make at home. For some, this may be appealing. For others, not so much. For me it was fine. I didn't LOVE it, but I enjoyed it quite a bit! It hit the spot.

When I first saw the fries, I thought ... \"Crinkle cut? Really?\"
But lo and behold, they were awesome. Extremely crispy and really well seasoned. I could easily see myself craving these often."}
{"text":"A classic-there is a reason it has been around so long!  They have delectable burgers with thick shakes-cheaper than Peters too!  I like the seasoning salt on the fries and the juicy burgers!"}
{"text":"GENUINE Old School drive-in Burgers Fries and Shakes here.

Cheap as all hell, and the food is good for what it is (ie: drive in bugers).
The fries are particularly good, old-skool krinkle cuts with orange seasoning salt, always hot and rad.

Im not certain, but I am convinced CB Drive In has been around UNCHANGED since the 60s or even 50s. In that way its a living legend.

Speaking of legends, the sincerely hilarious, friendly, and generally awesome Korean guy who owns and runs CB's is (or should be) a Calgarian institution. You just HAVE to go in person to experience this guy.

The \"Black Forest \" milkshake is great here as well."}
{"text":"seriously I've been coming here for at least 30 years! legendary burgers, amazing crinkle fries, and they used to have a licorice milkshake that was sooooo good! (it probably is still so good, but in my old age Milkshakes have become my enemy, sadly.)"}
