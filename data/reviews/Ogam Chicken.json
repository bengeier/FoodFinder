{"text":"THE best chicken joint in calgary. The deep fried chicken flavors is second to none.    If it was faster to cook id be there more often, but the 15 min wait requires preorder or dine in. Would die for drive thru"}
{"text":"Great chicken! IMO, soy-garlic is the flavour to get.  As for the sides, I liked the potato wedges and the obligatory pickled daikon. Even the salad was good - poppyseed dressing and dried cranberries; better than the typical spring mix.  I tried the Tteokbokki, but it was way too spicy for me. Fans of heat might enjoy that dish."}
{"text":"I love some fried chicken but Ogam puts a new meaning to good chicken they also have a great variety of Korean food. I would rather eat here then most chicken restaurants the prices are a bit more but the quality speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Chill and casual vibe with very tasty food. Had their Ogam fried chicken and the sweet spicy chicken. Both were fantastic. Can't go wrong here if you want a quick bite to eat or just hang out with friends. Great prices"}
{"text":"Sooo yummy!!   One, if not the best fried chicken in the city!!   Gotta try the sauces and fries here too!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. The food is very good and consistent. I really like the chicken but lately I've been ordering other things. The bibimbap is great! Love how clean this place is too!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted to try something new so I went to Yelp for any recommendations. We went to two restaurants but they were closed for renovations so we went to Ogam.  Ogam is located across from Chinook Centre in the small mini strip mall where the Le Chateau outlet used to be (the big purple building). There's a lot of parking in the area just as long as it doesn't say reserve or a 15 minute park time for the liquor store.  Our experience was okay, a mixture of both good and bad. They offer you cutlery but don't provide you with plates unfortunately. A cool thing is if you order pop they give you a cup with a can of your choice but they don't provide a straw which is weird since majority of the restaurants we've been to do. I mean drinking out of the cup is okay but I think for more professional more sanitary reasons proving a straw with your drink is always better.  We were greeted and seated right away but waiting to place our orders and waiting for the food to come took a really long time. We saw a group walked out because of the slow service, which is really disappointing and it does ruin the restaurant's image.   My girlfriend ordered their chicken teriyaki and she was really disappointed because for $14.50 she had a small portion sized chicken and steamed rice, no vegetables or more chicken to make up for the lack of plating space. I myself had ordered the sweet spicy chicken, you can also add cheese or fried rice for $3 more. I thought I wouldn't need it but boy was I wrong. There is no sweet flavours in the sweet spicy chicken, it was all spicy that was marinated into the chicken and the vegetables. When I found out that they didn't provide plates I got really disappointed and I wouldn't dare eat out of the sweet spicy chicken plating because it doesn't look professional so I had no choice but to order a side of rice just to get a plate.  Overall the experience was okay. If Ogam were to offer faster and more efficient service and plates then our experience would be different!  I would still recommend Ogam to others but for us this is a one time visit."}
{"text":"Friendly service? Check. Delicious finger licking deep fried batter? check. Moist juicy chicken meat? Check. Sweet coleslaw to counter the deep fried goodness? Check.  Ogam chicken is conveniently located on McLeod trail across from Chinook mall. Do yourself a favour and check it out. Korean Fried Chicken is my crack and I am happy to (continuously) bring my business to Ogam Chicken!  There is a slight language barrier but the food and service more than makes up for it.  I have gone to olive chicken and chicken on the way but I have to say that in terms of tender chicken meat that doesn't taste dry, this place definitely knows what it's doing!  There are other Korean specials besides KFC and I look forward to trying them out in the near future.  The lady behind the counter is so sweet and I would suggest going to the ogam website- there is a coupon for 10% off!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best fried chicken I have ever had. My only qualm is their delivery options -  ie. you cannot add side sauce to family packs as there is no option for this and when added to the notes to add this, they ignore the request. There is however an option for this on certain items, but it shouldn't be selective."}
{"text":"Solid Korean Fried Chicken, which for the unfamiliar usually involves a thicker coating, and a choice of sweet and savory sauces draped over it. A combo of crunchy and crispy, and moderate on the sauce front, Ogam gets it right.  The meat is also nice and juicy, and you can get rice, onion rings, or potatoes as the side. Not a cheap place, but reasonable for the quality. My table mate had a pan-fried pork belly dish that was quite tasty, with a distinct porcine flavor rather than just tasting like stir-fry sauce. The decor is pretty basic, service fairly quick, and the servers have a working grasp of English. All in all, a good spot for lunch or a casual dinner."}
{"text":"Good fried chicken, not as saucy as some places. I like saucy better. The dish described as Korean rice cakes with vegetables is more like thick, solid tubes of pasta in a kim chee sauce. Light on the veggies, hot but not too hot, with weird wiener like pieces of rice pasta."}
{"text":"Oh man, Ogam! I seriously love this place. I wish I didn't live so far from it, buuuut maybe that's best because I'd probably be here all the time lol  The have lunch specials (pork belly? YES!), those delish but SUPER spicy thick rice noodles (Tteokbokki) and of course, their flavorful and crispy fried chicken.  I liked that they do have different options of Korean dishes to try here, and the staff is quite helpful explaining the dishes you're not familiar with.  It's a open, clean and bright restaurant as well which is always a plus.  Prices are quite reasonable, and you'll definitely leave full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"When i crave chicken, ogam comes to mind.  Soy garlic is like the beast mode of all fried chickens. I get the traditional bibimbap and side orders of rice to share with my bff then eat with the chicken. One time, they probably got my order mixed up because I got spicy soy garlic, but I ate it all anyway because it's so good too. Service is not slow considering that there is one server per shift. Hella good chicken."}
{"text":"Background: solo business traveler. Need food, preferably with flavor. Taken a circuitous route: Australia, Kentucky, Edmonton, Calgary. Well:  Cold beer. Excellent chicken meal. No old boiler this one, tender, juicy super-tasty (hot soy-garlic seasoning) with decent rice & salad. Nor did it seem to be hormone-fueled pap. Cheap enough to put pretentious eateries to shame. So, bingo! Just enjoy....."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Calgary to get some fried chicken, don't miss the bulgogi dishes either. Top notch!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass hot soy garlic bites. Best chicken in the city. Period.  Wish they had more appetizers though, and there dip selection is a little weak"}
{"text":"Possibly the best Korean fried chicken we've ever tried! Went with a large group recently, so we had the luxury of trying every flavour at least once ;). Worth the heartburn.   Huge portion sizes, juicy chicken, strong flavours. Service was quick and pretty pleasant - we did have a strange moment when our server appeared as if they'd never heard of \"wet naps\". As it turns out, they go by \"fresh naps\" here and all you have to do, I guess, is get off your butt and go get them yourself at the counter :P."}
{"text":"While I can't yet consider Calgary a top tier food town (though it's definitely been making serious improvements in recent years), it definitely has its pleasant surprises. One of which has been legit Korean fried chicken, originally by way of Olive Chicken, then also Yum Yum Chicken.  Not all cities are blessed with good \"KFC\", for example it still hasn't really caught on in a big way in Vancouver (there are a couple places, but they're not spectacular...the one downtown Zabu is terribly overpriced to boot), and my current home of Portland, Oregon has yet to be truly impacted by the incredible phenomenon that is Korean fried chicken. In the US, LA and NYC are probably most well known for being meccas to find good KFC.  Back to Calgary: enter Ogam Chicken & Korean restaurant, a new hole-in-the-wall joint near Chinook Centre that serves up some mighty fine Korean fried chicken. Best of all, instead of a fast food atmosphere like Olive or Yum Yum, Ogam is closer to an izakaya, a little trendy but still very casual, and it's a great place to hang out.  To me, it was very close to recreating the atmosphere from an awesome KFC experience I had in NYC at Mad for Chicken (sorry BonChon - I think you've become a victim of your own success and your glory days are behind you. Still lots of tourists will flock your way though). At Ogam, you can also order alcoholic drinks (yay soju!) with your chicken - an awesome match made in heaven, and a combination you won't find at the other Calgary KFC joints. Now you're also telling me I can also have solid Korean BBQ including pork belly, bulgogi and kalbi beef short ribs alongside awesome Korean fried chicken?! ! Get the f@#* outta here!!   Anyway, on my first trip I was only able to have myself a 10 piece order of the seasoned chicken wings, and they were pretty epic. Exceptionally well-executed, the wings were juicy, crispy and the the flavors were as good (though not necessarily identical to) as top KFC eats I've had at the other Calgary places and also in NYC. I would love to try the soy garlic larger chicken pieces, as well as some of the BBQ dishes on my next visit, hopefully with some good friends. I did see some of these dishes being served to other tables, and they looked very enticing, and my fellow patrons really seemed to be enjoying their food and the overall experience. The service is fast and efficient, but still very friendly.  While I can't crown a king for the best Korean fried chicken in Calgary, I have to say that Ogam is definitely a very strong contender. Add on the fact that it's a great place to hang out, have a drink to complement your eats, and also get Korean BBQ, this is definitely going to be a new favorite place of mine going forward. If you're still reading this, dammit what are you waiting for? Get in the car and go there now!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly, and very courteous staff! Great food, good variety! Portions are quite healthy and are served quickly and very hot! the light fresh tasty Korean fried chicken will make you use kentukyfriedchicken for a door stop."}
{"text":"I wish I could tell you what the food is like but we got kicked out before we could even sit down because my fiancee has a guide dog. Even after explaining it was a service dog, the lady didn't care. We have now received and apology from the staff and have discussed handling situations for special needs such as guide dogs. Maybe some day soon we will go and try the food."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was delicious, crunchy and juicy. I tried both the standard and the sweet soy and can't pick a favourite out of the two. The pieces are heavy in flavour and protein fatty goodness and after 1-2 pieces I couldn't handle any more....geez I'm an old man.  Then again it's also because I was tackling their bibimbap, which was done on a hot stone bowl (dolsot), served with 2-3 mini banchan plates. Wow, what a beast of a meal. The veggies were all distinct in flavour and were freshly prepared.l and the fresh egg tied the whole rice bowl together once I mixed it all up with the gouchujang sauce they provide in a squeeze bottle.  Prices were very reasonable and our bill rivalled the cost of visiting a Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here twice this week and loving it!  Let's start with the chicken. Got the half bird with soy garlic sauce both times and let me tell you, some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. If you've had Bon Chon, this is similar if not better! Super crispy on the outside but not too thick, very juicy meat and just the perfect amount of sauce, not drenche and not greasy! Love the sweet and spicy soy garlic sauce! Perfect fried chicken  I love how this place has Korean bbq as well as chicken. We tried the beef ribs which were tender with a great sauce. Came with Korean side dishes, lettuce and rice.  They have a lunch special every day for $9.99, tried the Bulgogi with rice and salad. Large portion and perfectly cooked beef.  The interior is super clean, nice simple decor, clean bathrooms and not just a \"hole in the wall\" the servers are nice and attentive.  All in all, this place is amazing! I kinda wanna keep it a secret but in want them to be successful haha definitely adding this to my Korean food spots in Calgary!"}
{"text":"I love everything #Korean and now I know where to satisfy my korean spicy chicken craving. 5 piece chicken (big sizes) thats $13 is enough for 2. The only thing I didnt like about this resto is their lack of side dishes. Side dishes are always serve (always!) in a korean meal- so just 4 stars."}
{"text":"What an amazing surprise!   Looks like it's just another strip mall spot and then BLAM! So delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this. I will eat here whenever we are around this area. Awesome staff. Servings are so big considering prices aren't so bad. Everything's very well- flavored. 10 thumbs up for ogam!!! :)"}
{"text":"The reason that I am only giving this place 2-stars is the service. I have been there 4 times, 3 for take-out. The 1st time the menu was extremely confusing and they didn't take the time to explain that I had other options other than fried chicken. The next couple of times were more or less the same. The last time I went I ate in and the menu layout has much improved. The server pointed to a table and because I was  expecting a call on my cell I asked if I could sit on the opposite side of the room and was shouted a loud \"NO\". Soon after other customers just came in and sat down at the tables (same size tables) and no one really confronted them or asked them to move. The food is good, a bit expensive, for the portions. The fried chicken is crispy and I thought really good but I've since had other KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) and have to say that Yum Yum impressed me more with their flavour. I asked if they had any hot sauce and was told the only sauce was Korean Hot Sauce and I would have to pay $1 for it. It ended up as $1.50 on the bill. It came in a salad dressing size bowl. My water was never refilled. Other people had bottles of go chu jang with their meals. The restaurant was half empty and I was lingering as I was in the middle of a call (I generally don't do long calls in public but I was on the listening end to a friend in need). The server came and basically plunked the bill down and told me \"finished diner\" and then pointed to the cash counter. There were lots of tables available and no one waiting at the door. Her english was excellent so I doubt this is a case of poor language skills. I'm just telling you what my experience was. The food was good but it's not somewhere I would go out of my way for. If you're wondering why I've been there 4 times, it's because I always give a place several chances before I give a less than glowing review. I tend to be optimistic that perhaps the people are having a bad day and think the next time will be better. There are more and more Korean alternatives in Calgary and as good or better."}
{"text":"First time visit to Ogam on November 11 around lunch time. I had the sweet and spicy chicken combo and also tried some of my husband's fried chicken.   The sweet and spicy chicken was nicely spiced and well portioned. The fried chicken was excellent, with a thick breading, moist chicken and a slow building spice.   Very friendly service and great prices. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ogam hands down changed fried chicken for me forever. Their fried chicken is always served piping hot, super crispy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. My favorite sauce for the fried chicken is soy garlic, it has a bit of spice and it's perfectly sweet and garlicky. The hot sauces like hot soy garlic are PRETTY spicy. By pretty I mean really spicy if you're like me and can handle spice well. I would recommend it if you like really spicy food. But regardless all the sauces are still very delicious.  A couple of my other favs are the potato wedges (really great with the chicken if you don't feel like rice), short ribs, pork belly, and kimchi pork soup. I've honestly never been disappointed with anything I've ordered from here. The owner is such a sweet lady and she always remembers me when I come in. I love places who value their regular clientele!  Ogam definitely has the best Korean fried chicken in the city (that I've tried and I've been around lol) and they also serve a lot of traditional dishes too. They have a pretty good selection of beers too so you can't go wrong with that!  I will continue to drag my friends and family here because this place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place makes good chicken! Crispy and moist, and even the original/dry is not bland like other Korean chicken places.  The only thing is that the customer service can be a bit hit or miss. Sometimes service is friendly and fast and sometimes it's unbearingly slow."}
{"text":"I totally agree with all the previous reviews about Ogam. They truly offer some great food and service, the crispy chicken was outstanding as well as the spicy chicken and bulgogi."}
{"text":"We went there for a late lunch. The service was good. We got the tofu soup, spicy rice cake, crispy fried chicken and BBQ short rib. The fried chicken was really crispy but not very well seasoned in the center. The short ribs were so chewy... The seafood soup was pretty good. Spicy rice cake was chewy too. Overall, just ok"}
{"text":"I heard about how this place discriminated against a visually impaired woman because she arrived with her Seeing Eye dog. Their employees need to undergo some sensitivity, awareness, and legal training. Something like this could end in a lawsuit. An apology is in order as well as a promise to do better."}
{"text":"The bibimbap was out of this world amazing. The service was very helpful and friendly"}
{"text":"Open till 8:00pm but turn customers away at 7:30pm unless ordering take out. How does this make sense, the food is being made regardless. Terrible business practice."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch - great food, clean inside and nice service.  Portions are a great value as wel."}
{"text":"My friend and I were really excited to check this place out. So we go in, it's 7:40, we wait for a table for like 15 minutes. We get seated for a table and get menus, it's like 8pm. 8:09 server comes up to us saying that they \"close at 9\" and fried chicken takes too long to cook and eat. So anything we order has to be for take out. We literally just got up and left. Thanks for wasting our time."}
{"text":"Came here to check this place out since I saw the rating pretty good on Yelp. I went inside and I have noticed that even though its name is Ogam Chicken, only one table out of 6 tables (including me) ordered chicken. I have noticed the chicken portion is quite small and they charge $$$ for each piece. I decided to order the Bibimbap instead because there were other tables ordering it. The bibimbap before tax was $15.25. Definitely pricier than majority Korean restaurants. On top of it, they were very skimpy on the meat. There was hardly any meat. Mostly rice. Bowl big but they do not use the traditional stone bowl.   Not sure why other people are not ordering their chicken when their name trys to sell its chicken as being the popular item. Its located in a strip mall. The restaurant looks like its a family ran business. Nothing fancy.   Parking is available in front.   Don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"Upon a recommendation from a coworker, decided to check this place out on a Saturday night. We were seated fairly quickly as it was a full house at 6:50pm. We got our menus and then no one came to take our order. 15-20 min went by and I approached the counter to ask if I needed to order right there although she did take the order from another table. Anyhow, things were better after that.   It was our first time here so we asked questions about the flavours of chicken offered. She was was helpful and then we had our drinks within 5 min. 15 min later, our basket of potato wedges came out piping hot and well seasoned. Next up, 10 pieces of crispy chicken and 5 pieces of spicy soy garlic chicken and a glass noodle with beef n veggies.   Crispy chicken was delicious and so moist! The crunch on the skin was fantastic!  The spicy soy garlic had perfect heat and the glass noodles had a good sesame oil based sauce on it. We have hit the jackpot for KFC (Korean fried chicken).  So sad that yum yum has gone downhill. Ogam hits the spot for fried chicken..."}
{"text":"OMG I can't move...sooooo full gonna write the review while I try to get blood to my legs again. Garlic soy chicken 5 pieces is pretty much a whole chicken. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I say goooooodddaaaayam.....love me some korean fried chicken.  Come here for the fried chicken but lots of other korean goodness.  Nice crunch to the breading but still tender and moist on the inside.  Will definitely put this place on my rotation when I visit Calgary.  Tried the bulgogi as well and it was excellent.  Deeeeeelish!"}
{"text":"We asked a salesperson in the mall for a recommendation and she suggested Ogam, \"it we liked fried chicken\". We didn't end up going that day but then a few days later we were driving by and stopped in. It was OUTSTANDING! We ordered the fried chicken, and also a pan seared chicken dish. I craved the fried chicken for the rest of our short trip and we had to make another stop before heading to the airport.  I'm sure everything else is good, but make the trip for the Korean fried chicken. I just checked my map and it's 12 hours 47 minutes from here..."}
{"text":"The short ribs 4 of the 10 pieces were all fat, so it was unable to be eaten. Terrible service,  filled water only once. The chicken bites had no sauce, as it had to be separately purchased. Min. service fee is 15%. The worst Korea restaurant we have ever tried, never come again."}
{"text":"The pork belly was so tasty . We also had some Spicy grilled chicken. As for the fried chicken - We had original chicken, soy garlic chicken, and the spicy chicken. Jap chae was tasty as well had good amount of veggies. The meal came with 3 side dishes: beansprouts, some corn macaroni, and kimchi radish.   The grilled dishes were a little expensive for what you get but both were tasty. Then the fried chicken quality was great because it was really crispy. Food 5/5.  Service was ok. 3/5. They didn't really come around very much to clear the dishes and you have to flag people down."}
{"text":"The chicken was good and the wedges were amazing. I was not entirely sold on what exactly a korean chicken is."}
{"text":"We just got out of Ogam Chicken and I can't say I was truly impressed or disappointed.   As soon as we entered the restaurant, we were greeted and seated quickly. We ordered onion rings, original chicken, gamjatang, and pork belly. After 5 minutes or so, the server came back and informed us that they were out of gamjatang, which is disappointing as it is raining today and I was looking forward to it(I looked into their menu before coming).  It took 30 minutes for the onion rings and 5 pieces of chicken to come to our table. Then another 15 minutes after that for the pork belly and the rest of the food. The whole restaurant only had 4 customers, and all were already eating at this point. So I would think the service would be quicker. Also, our water/drinks were not refilled at all throughout the dinner and we had to ask the server before we were about to pay for some water.  The food was fine, the chicken was crispy and the pork belly was cooked nicely.  The onion rings were definitely store bought frozen onion rings.  Overall, Ogam Chicken is fine, not the best korean chicken joint and certainly not the worst."}
{"text":"We love korean fried chicken and we wanted to check Ogam out. We've had a bunch of fried chicken while in Seoul and found it a great snack to have while enjoying some drinks. Ogam was not bad for majority of their korean food (the japchae was not bad but a bit small). The fried chicken had too much batter on it. Korean friend chicken normally is a bit lighter and crispier, but I found that I was eating more batter than chicken. We tried the regular and the sweet and spicy version and liked the saucy a bit more."}
{"text":"Love love love their fried chicken! I am no stranger to Ogam (or fried chicken) and have been getting my fix from them for a while. I've tried other places in the city, but I always seem to be coming back to this place. I usually just order take out for the lazy nights and when I just need some chicken. I unfortunately haven't tried their other Korean dishes as I feel like it would be better if you actually dine-in.   Every time I go, their chicken is perfectly seasoned, has a thick crispy coating and is incredibly juicy. They have a range of sauces to pick from as well if you want some (my favourite is the seasoned sauce). Their family combo #2 is perfect for 2 people and only comes down to $13/person. It also comes with their ogam chicken bites which I feel is an absolute must!"}
{"text":"Oh man, the chicken is so delicious! My husband got it as take out while I was in the hospital after my son was born and it was a great treat. Definitely recommend this place over the chains. The chicken is fresh, crunchy and not overly greasy."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here for the first time awhile ago and it was fantastic. The colonel has nothing on Koreans in the fried chicken space.  We got both crispy pieces and flavored bites and by the time I got them home, still delicious and crispy.  I have absolutely no bad things to report from ordering. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after work during a business trip recently. Excellent fried Chicken, very crunchy and flavorful! Very friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Communications were a little difficult when asking for hot sauce but no other complaints"}
{"text":"The chicken is really good....i wouldn't recommend to get the pork belly though...its too much $$ for the amount u get...i would stay with the chicken. The one server we knew from insadong.so she is super good. Also the food came really fast and hot and pretty tasty. I asked what o gham means... O means 5 Gham means senses  We use our 5 senses when we eat.  I give it 3 stars because of the serving size of  the pork belly as for the fried chicken...i would say cheaper than yum yum chicken and waaaaay better"}
