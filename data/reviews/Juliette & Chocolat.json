{"text":"J'adore Juliette & Chocolat. C'est le genre d'endroits, presque un salon de thé, qui manque à New York. Rien que la carte des chocolats chauds m'a soufflée: une petite vingtaine de choix donnés en \"single origin\" pour mieux déguster la saveur du chocolat... wow.

J'ai aussi essayé tous leurs pots de crèmes (je crois): j'ai adoré le praliné et le caramel salé. Ce dernier était peut-être un peu trop sucré, mais il était en même temps tellement bon...

Leurs desserts n'ont pas la richesse de la Maison du Chocolat, ni la complexité de ceux de Hévin, mais ils sont délicieux tout de même, à leur propre façon.

Gros coup de coeur de Montréal."}
{"text":"Charging customers for decaf coffee or requesting to have same type of ice cream on your Profiteroles is a bad practice to keep faithful clientele."}
{"text":"Good dessert, but slow service. They had a real lack of servers when I went, and it must've been really hard on them since the dessert place was completely full of customers. 
The slow service may impact your dessert, as ice cream can melt, your hot chocolate can get cold, and etc. 
The desserts that I order whenever I go are always delicious, though, so even though they have slow service, I tend to visit regularly for my sugar fix. 
If you love chocolate, this is a must-try place in Montreal."}
{"text":"The original and best of the Juliette et Chocolat locations, this place is a chocoholic's paradise. The hot chocolates, vintages, brownies, crepes, fondue and other delicacies are to die for. Even the salads have the option of chocolate dressing. The wait staff wear French-style red hats -- a bit cheesy, but it adds to the atmosphere. Try the grandma's style hot chocolate. Everything is super rich and indulgent, just as a chocolaterie should be. 

This is a great place for date night or girls' night out. It gets crowded in the evenings -- expect lineups but worth the wait. The locations on St-Laurent or on Laurier are bigger and usually have more tables available."}
{"text":"Ohhhh Juliette et Chocolat! What's not to love about your chocolately goodness? If you're in town you simply MUST make a stop at this Montreal institution. This particular location is nice because its so much bigger than the others throughout the city. Its really spacious with lots of tables and the line-up goes faster than others! I remember, a few years ago now, this place used to be a supper club-nightclub type place and the transformation is crazy! You now feel like you're in a quaint little bakery shop! The service is always pretty good, if non-descript. Nothing to write home about but never awful either. 

The real attraction is the FOOD though, my gawwd its good. I always order the Chocolat fondant or Caramel fondant--like a lava-cake with delicious filling ooozzing out with the best vanilla ice cream you've ever tasted served on the side. You might get it and think 'gee, that's pretty small,' but looks are deceiving. I'm always full after eating it--its rich but delicious! You can't go wrong either with any of the brownies. The 'fleur de sel' is particularly good (it is Quebec after all!) and pair it with a scoop of ice cream and you've got the perfect treat! If you go, you simply must have a hot chocolate. The hot chocolate is not the powered crap you buy from a grocery store--or even a coffee shop, these days--but rather legitimate chocolate melted down and mixed with hot milk. They also offer some savoury crepes and while I've personally never ordered one everyone who has tells me they're also very good. If you don't have a lot of time--but want to experience the Juliette experience--they offer all of their brownies to go and you can simply order with the hostess at the stand with the till/cash register. 

Go! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We went only for dessert and were delighted. 
My only disappointment was that alcohol is only available with full meals- I was looking forward to a glass of wine with my chocolate.  Also, there was not a kids menu. 
Higher prices but definitely worth it for the higher quality desserts. 
Real caramel sauce!? Yes please."}
{"text":"From the moment we got there, it was a disappointment one after another. We were a group of 15, but instead of being seated right away, they were debating whether to let us in or not. Finally, after waiting outside in the cold, they decided to split us up into smaller tables. Then, to our disappointment, they gave us a reduced menu, even though we saw a couple sitting next to our menu getting the full menu. I ordered a regular dark hot chocolate. It was not bad, but my expectations were a lot higher for the price I was paying. Overall, poor service, slightly pricey, and \"meh\" quality."}
{"text":"Restaurant p-a-r-f-a-i-t! Rien de négatif à dire! Il faut ABSOLUMENT essayer le brownie à la fleur de sel qui est probablement meilleur que tout ce que vous avez goûté dans votre vie! Les crêpes sont également excellentes. Je recommande également les galettes au sarasin qui sont excellentes pour le lunch. Plus spécifiquement la complète pesto qui est  succulente! Allez-y tous vous ne serez pas déçu!"}
{"text":"The dark chocolate drink was really good :) i ordered a small one because I was worried for the extra calories. Now I am just missing that and wish i had the large..."}
{"text":"Cute little chocolate café in the heart of the Latin Quarter.  They have chocolate in everything you can imagine, so whatever your fancy, surely you can find it here.  Had the iced latte and peanut butter brownie.  Not as decadent as some of the other menu items, but was really good nonetheless.  They even have a chocolate \"shot\" on the menu as well as fondue dipping chocolate.  Great place to sit outside in the sunshine and people watch and catch up.  Would return when I'm getting a serious chocolate craving!"}
{"text":"Très bon."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to visit Juliette Et Chocolat on our honeymoon. We stopped in for a late-night dessert, and thought we'd get a quick sweet crepe, and maybe a brownie to go along with it.

A host quickly approached us upon our arrival and sat us down at a table. Either by our deer-in-the-headights look, or my saying, \"Hello,\" immediately upon entering, he could tell that we only spoke English (however much we wished we spoke French), and he handed us their English menu.

After looking over our choices we asked our waitress for the Dulce de Leche and Pear crepe, and The Peanut brownie.

Service was fast, and we received our crepe only 5 minutes later. As soon as we looked at our crepe we were both disappointed. They used canned pears!! The corn syrup soaked, grainy textured, pears were accompanied by a caramel that seemed to just be mixed with milk, since you couldn't taste the Dulce de Leche at all, and the caramel drizzle was hardly enough to bring any flavor back to our washed out crepe.

The brownie had the distinct flavor of being from a box. Rather than the rich cocoa an butter flavor of a freshly baked brownie, all we could taste was a syrupy flavor (which we simply presumed was more corn syrup, though we may be wrong). The peanut butter that came in the brownie was not fresh tasting, but had more of a Jiffy flavor.

Although some of the service we great, and we really liked how the host intuited that we were English-speakers, we can't recommend this place as somewhere someone should eat."}
{"text":"The Fleur de Sel brownie at Juliette was by far one of the finest I've ever had.  The jamaican coffee -- a mixture of rum, cointreau, and espresso, topped with whipped cream, was equally delicious.  Topped off with a smartly and tastefully appointed dining room (despite being the holiday season with all the associated hazards of tawdriness) and excellent waitstaff, the experience has me yearning for more.  It is expensive, but worth the indulgence if you have the money."}
{"text":"Juliette et Chocolat, chocolate specialists only apparently.

It is often said, in the restaurant business, that crepes and galettes are the most lucrative plate. Sell food, it is a restaurant's objectif, but Juliette et Chocolat, precisely the one on avenue Laurier, doesn't know a thing in the art of making a galette, as simple as it can be.

We order a \"complete\" galette and everything but \"complete\" it was, the gallette. Empty, dry, crispy (the bad way)... obviously only the presentation seemed to preoccupy.
Finally, apparently the particular etablishment does not seem to want to try and make the effort to propose real gallettes that one can actually eat. The model must be way too lucrative with the limited ingredients quantity and the turnover on avenue Laurier.

Juliette et Chocolat should restrain in doing chocolate desserts only. Dessert's hot spot and nothing else. We would feel less stolen from; 27 $ for two galettes \"completes\" and two juices ...from concentrated (no real fresh juice !).

BIG DECEPTION"}
{"text":"It was a drab & extremely rainy day Saturday when i went to visit Montreal. I'd looked up Juliette's before heading out, stopped to ask the directions at the visitors center. The girl (AND the guy's) reaction when i mentioned the name had me sold. It was a must try the way they were almost swooning by the name... I am so glad i trekked out to this small but lively little cafe, because i sure as hell was in for a treat :D

My friends and I ordered the chocolate fondue (my fav was dipping kiwi fruit pieces in dark chocolate) and the extreme brownie( intense semi-sweet brownie with icecream and hot chocolate sauce) was to die for. I regret not having enough time to go back here again and am totally planning my next Montreal trip, based on the fact that i want to go try more of the chocolate yumminess! 

If you are serious about chocolate and are in Montreal, this place is somewhere you MUST go."}
{"text":"overrated is the word..the coffee is just meh and the food is just average don't think ill ever go back"}
{"text":"Le personnel est sympathique. Le menu est varié mais a surtout l'air délicieux, on a le goût de tout commander

Nous avons pris l'assiette de dégustation et je l'ai regretté. J'ai payé 15$ pour 4 mini version de leur plats. C'était bon mais beaucoup trop dispendieux, surtout si le but est d'essayer, pour éventuellement commander des plats complet. De plus, ils pourrait mettre des morceaux plus gros!

Dans l'assiette il y avait une mini-fondue, c'est à dire une tranche de banane, une demi fraise et un morceau de brownie pas vraiment plus grand. Le chocolat était froid donc plus solide que liquide. Pour un spécialiste en chocolat, je m'attendait a ce que le chocolat soit à une température idéale.

J'ai aussi commandé un chocolat chaud a l'ancienne, au lait. J'ai l'impression qu'ils m'ont servi un mi-amer et il était froid. Très déçu!

J'ai mis 3 étoiles car le personnel était sympathique et que malgré la température des aliments, c'était quand même bon. (C'est du chocolat après tout). Mais je vous déconseille le plat de dégustation!!


Suite: Après mon courriel, ils se sont excusés de la mauvaise expérience et m'ont offert un certificat cadeau."}
{"text":"I love chocolate!  I'm not sure why it has taken me so long to find a dessert place dedicated to it but finally! Heaven. Chocolate heaven. 

So even after a filling (and lacklustre meal) I was happy to find this just down the street from where we were - I can't say no to chocolate.  I love the red floppy chef hats that all the waitresses wear (they probably hate it) - it's cute and adds a cute look to the place. 
We were seated right away (we came around 8pm on a week night). Their menu is extensive.  They have savoury crepes but of course, the menu is dominated with chocolate desserts & drinks.  
Ordered:

The Antillaise crepe ($13.95): grilled bananas & pineapples with two scoops of ice cream with chocolate sauce drizzled all over it.  It's one of their flaming crepes (yes - flaming!).  So it was flamed with rum.  So I was expecting a fiery of FLAMES but alas it was only meek blue ones that can only be seen in my photo if you zoom in. Oh well, the flame itself was great!  Grilled pineapples and chocolate - hello and welcome to my belly!

Araguni, chocolate to drink ($9.75): this is off their dark vintages menu.  It was thick, warm and just slightly sweet.  Hot chocolate from other places just seem like a farce now, though much better for your wallet. For $9.75, I thought this was a bit pricey. 

Another one of those places that I wish I had in my home town.  Sigh."}
{"text":"Granny liquid hot choc is good, rolled with the semi sweet.   Crepe with salted caramel and fried bananas was good but would have been better with more bananas and without the ice cream.   Pairing of granny and crepe was overwhelming, even pour moi!   Service was hectic and disorganized, took far too long to get our food.  The gnats buzzing about my table when it's snowing outside was a bit much.  Maybe they were really fruit flies, whatever, it was distracting and kinda gross.   Probably won't repeat.   Hope your experience is better than mine.  Good luck."}
{"text":"Je suis européen et je viens de débarquer a Mtl, une collègue de travail, ma  recommandé d'aller ici , et je n'ai pas été déçus. 
Pas beaucoup d'attente pour être servi, serveuse sympa, de la place pour s'assoir et surtout le principal c'est vraiment BON! 
J'y retournerai ;)"}
{"text":"Slow service and we have been waiting very long for the meal also. But the food itself is richy and good."}
{"text":"Only had time for take out but I was definitely glad I dropped by.   The aroma of all the nearby desserts was to die for.   I despereately wanted a savoury crepe but didn't think it would travel well.   Ordered two intense brownies and they definitely lived up to the hype, along with hot chocolate with salted caramel that went down real well.   Will definitely be back to further explore the menu in a dine in experience."}
{"text":"I ordered a hot chocolate with a scoop of ice cream, but rather than getting a hot chocolate, I got a cold chocolate. Yes, the ice cream would have cooled it down, but the hot chocolate should still be hot! It's like the hot chocolate was just sitting around before they added the ice cream and served it. The chocolate flavour was also not very good. Tasted like cheap chocolate. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Quality, perfect quantity and fairly priced. Good service, nice waiters, professionasl and quick."}
{"text":"Honestly? Only 4 out of 5? This has to be the best place for desert in town. Yes I agree there is a wait many times but who cares? They have great service and their deserts are phenomenal. I can't get enough of their intense brownie, really only true chocolate fans can handle it."}
{"text":"They know how to make sweet food. There is a very large variety of chocolate and chocolate desserts, such as crepes, ice creams, waffles, and chocolate fondues. The drinking chocolate is extremely sweet and thick, and after ordering it, I wished that I hadn't ordered anything else. The crepes are huge, and might even be big enough to share. They also have non-sweet foods such as salads and sandwiches, however, there was nothing special about them. They have menus in both English and French so don't be afraid to ask."}
{"text":"A friend recommended us to go here and this place didn't disappoint! I ordered the caramel trifle and I had a orgy in my mouth! I also ordered a hot chocolate (can't remember what type i think it was the hazelnut) and it was too bitter for my taste. I also ordered a packge of their chocolates and even after 3 days they tasted amazing, much better than your boxed chocos that you can buy from the mall/drug store etc. Above all the staff was friendly :D"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and my husband and I visited on the last day of our honeymoon.  We got galettes (savory crepes) and they were OK.  But they were out of bacon the day we were there.  Out of bacon!  in Canada!  So they substituted chicken instead, which was just a bit unsatisfying and threw the flavor combos off.  
The petit pots of chocolate were absolutely delightful though - creamy and decadent, not over-sweet.  Perhaps the lesson we learned is to get sweets at a sweet shop, and savory food elsewhere."}
{"text":"The crepes are delish. Great atmosphere, service was awesome. Perfect place to be for some chocolate overdose & good conversations."}
{"text":"Great place to have dessert after nice dinner! Not many ice cream menu but loads of other crepe and waffle. Will return to this place"}
{"text":"C'était un peu bruyant mais la nourriture était formidable et le décor était mignon. Les prix étaient abordables. J'ai pris une crêpe salée au chèvre et au miel qui était vraiment délicieuse, et une crêpe aux fruits et au chocolat pour le dessert. Miam!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like chocolate?
I've had the chance to visit Juliette & Chocolat many many times and therefore, to try a bunch of things, all were great!
My only problem (thus the 1* missing) is how they always serve you the hot chocolate without the items/half of the people served but not the others/the hot chocolate isn't that \"hot\".
Apart from this, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmh les profiteroles sont à tomber par terre. 
Love love love the profiteroles. 
The rest is ok. I tried the pecan brownie/ way too many pecan. The icecream sandwich is also just ok. The icecream is very sweet and the melted chocolate is not that impressive for that dish. 
But I definitely recommend to go for the profiteroles."}
{"text":"Dessert was acceptable. However the service was both slow and inefficient. When the length of time to wait was discussed with the server the reaction of \"it's not my fault\" was rather useless. Why would you charge a premium for decaf?"}
{"text":"F Grade for the \"Fruits Fondue\". Rotten (See attached pics) and this is not the first time ..."}
{"text":"Excellent dessert crepe. We shared a chocolate and pear crepe. It was smothered in dark chocolate, flambé with liquor and had two large scoops of vanilla ice cream.

The restaurant was very cosy but not claustrophic.  They were able to seat all of us, 2 adults and 3 children without an difficulties.  The server was very helpful when we inquired about nut allergies ...go with the hot chocolate or lemonade in that case."}
{"text":"My review concerns the service only, as I didnt get a chance to taste the delicious sounding spicy chocolate I was ready to order. 

We were seated and given menus plus water. then we waited.
I do believe we were seated in a no man's land of service. a vortex that made us invisible to the waiters hurrying by us to take orders from patrons who just sat down. 
Or...or maybe the waiter that was assigned our table, and our table only because everyone around us was being served, had thrown his red hat on the ground and quit his job to finally become the street artist he always wanted to be?

We had time to wonder because from the time we walked in, to the time we left without being served, it had been around half an hour.  

And yes I know, I could have complained about the service to the floor manager, if I had found them, or just pin a waiter down and forced them to take my order but the chocolate craving had dissapeared at  that point, we just ended up at the irish pub across the street, sipping beers and munching angrily on nachos."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed the marshmallow madness and chocolate grananche  brownie.
The service was excellent and friendly. Marshmallows were fantastic."}
{"text":"You can also eat some crepes sweet or salt. I recommended you the chocolat fountain, so delicious !"}
{"text":"Pretty good chocolate fondant. A little cold however and we ended up waiting an hour before we got our food. The waitress was friendly however. The place is also predominantly French so if you don't speak the language you may not like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious desserts. Just wish they had better savory options so we could enjoy dinner before our dessert. The crepes are ok for a lunch but not a dinner."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. It's hard to be majorly terrible when all you well is incredibly rich and chocolate-y foods.  

I came with a friend on a Tuesday night around 9:30. It was busy but we didn't have to wait for a table. Service was pleasant but a little slow and our foods themselves took a longer than expected.  I had the white chocolate raspberry smoothie and my friend had a hot chocolate - we also split a.. I think it was called 'Trifle' heavy cream and salty caramel bits as well as brownie bits all served with hot chocolate to pour over it.  Wow. Everything was very rich and sweet.  Our beverages came with a free crepe, which we got to go because it was already too much dessert. (I'm guessing the crepe would have been way more delicious at that time than for breakfast the next day, which is when I ate it. )

The desserts were pretty delicious, but as far as chocolate standards go, pretty middling.  Would I come here again, absolutely, especially with a chocolate-lover. Would a bring a foodie here for dessert? Probably not. The selections were too standard and the quality only average. 

That said, unless you are a chocolate nerd, you should probably read this review as 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great place for dessert!  However, be prepared to wait... the lineups can be pretty long. The dessert is fabulous! I tried the Chocolate Praline Bombe... it was heavenly!  They serve savoury items too for those that don't have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Excellent both on taste and presentation for the Profiteroles and Café Viennois. Service was good but a bit slow as the restaurant was crowded at the time. Only complaint was the very hot and humid seating area. Would definitely return to try other menu items"}
{"text":"Awesome desserts, I had some sort of chocolate banana split with brownie pieces. Although the selection of tea is lacking (8-10) it is all mid to high quality. Will return again for sure."}
{"text":"The delicious dairy overload sent my party and I on a quest to find the nearest bathroom upon finishing our food. The location is great, and the place itself is great, and nicely decorated. Unfortunately the service is horrendous. I don't know if I was expected to go make my meal on my own or what...

Anyway, our waitress took about 30 minutes to serve us. After the food came out, she literally disappeared. We waited for about two hours, after continuously asking others servers for the bill. FINALLY, the fourth server that we asked managed to track down our waitress and get us water before I literally died of thirst. Conveniently, our waitress decided to be super accommodating for about 2 minutes in order to (I'm assuming) rack in a decent tip. Just go to another location, the awful service here isn't even worth it."}
{"text":"My male friend and I happened upon this chocolatier in search of chocolate gifts for the ladies in our lives.  We were startled to find a restaurant setting.  Too embarrassed to leave, we sat for a lovely evening snack.  Actual review:  great service, desserts were good, only negative was it was expensive. 4 out of 5 crepes."}
{"text":"Creative, great quality, good service. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Be ready to head for the gym after a visit to J&C. This is the one place for all chocolate lovers. It's worth the experience.

However, when we went the service was absolutely awful. The food was good but not worth the wait. Everything was overpriced. Our waitress lost our order and we had to wait an extra half an hour before we got our food and that was without counting the time it took us to put our order and the time it took us to pay. 

If you have a lot of time on your hands and enjoy sitting down and chatting with friends then this is a good place to go. Otherwise, order a take-out or go to one of their other franchise."}
{"text":"Lovely spot! Bright, cheery, huge, and lively, this place is a gem. We had two crepes: sugar and a grilled banana with caramel. Both were delicious! We also had the Snow White hot chocolate and the Creole. Super tasty!!"}
{"text":"I love chocolate, and I seek out chocolate throughout the world when I travel. Upon visiting its website and reading reviews, it was clear that Juliette and Chocolat is less artisanal and more dessert-chain-esque. I was curious about this place but didn't prioritize it among my other chocolate stops in Montreal. On my last evening of a 4.5 day trip to the city, I decided to give it a go. The desserts were predictable but delicious. I order the fruit fondue with the s'mores bowl (the restaurant charged extra for the bowl even though the bowl is in the fondue's description!). The chocolate in the s'mores bowl was way, way, way too sweet. We probably only used a forth or a third of what was in the bowl for dipping. My partner ordered a crepe with bananas, hazelnuts, meringue, and 55% dark chocolate. We opted for the 55% because - and I know this from plenty of experience - that a chocolatier who doesn't know how to do 70% cocoa either has a bitter product or a produce dosed in too much vanilla. I have no idea what the 70% tastes like at Juliette, but the 55% was, again, extremely sweet. It was too sweet for my taste. We were also hopping for a dollop of meringue. Juliette provides a bowl of hard (freeze-dried?) meringue bits. We were not impressed with these. Still, Juliette is a fun place for dessert. Just don't go in expecting artisan chocolate."}
{"text":"Crepes, chocolate, and whiskey. Um...Yay!

So, we were looking for a place to get a light supper but got sidetracked when I saw this place. What. Chocolate? Omg. We have to go here.

Overall First Impression: Big date place. Great for after dinner dessert or drinks. Super great for a light meal and a heavier dessert. It's a large space that got busy and loud. Service was also a little slow, but we saw it as \"an opportunity to better practice the slow food movement\". :)

Chocolate Heaven: Loads of chocolate drink options (both with and w/out alcohol). The classic style is lighter while Grandma's style is heavier and more like sipping chocolate. Desserts, brownies, fondue, ice cream, pastries, and flamed crepes...ALL with chocolate. [hear chorus of angels]

We ordered 2 savory crepes and 1 very awesome chocolate drink:
Him: The pesto goat cheese with walnuts
Her: The Vegetarian (Mozzarella, tomatoes, and pesto)
Her again: Irish Chocolate (Dark chocolate and whiskey)

I liked the vegetarian crepe better than the pesto goat cheese.  The goat cheese was just a little too rich. Plus, anything tastes healthier with fresh tomatoes. The Irish chocolate was a thick, sipping drink, not too sweet, and with just the right amount of whiskey. 

I would SO come back here."}
{"text":"We got to enjoy crispy buckwheat crepes and light salad for lunch here. The wait staff brings a credit card machine to you and you can swipe and enter in the amount for tips right at your table. There are small gift options or desserts-on-the-go you can browse in the store."}

Merci pour le stress Juliette et Chocolat!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the entire experience I had at Juliette. The service was not good, simply because they were understaffed and unorganized. I went to Juliette for dessert, and the trifle I ordered - which was mostly just whipped cream - was the most cloying thing I've ever had. I couldn't finish it and I felt a bit sick as I waited (for several minutes) for my check. I suggest trying one of the many, many mom-and-pop places that abound around both locations of Juliette. I wish I had. I regretted choosing Juliette the minute I walked into its slick, corporate-heavy environment."}

The decor and ambiance was very basic
Too many choices on the menu but it's ok just because u don't know what to order

Again we end up spending 45$ for 2hot chocolate a Nutella crepe and a cheese and raspberry kind of verrine 1st and last time for me rather go to a French bakery on the street for 1/3 the price"}
{"text":"When I went here, this place was packed. It's line was so long. We decided to wait it out, since it must be good with sooo many people waiting.

We tried a couple of the crepes. They were amazing. I couldn't try the chocolate. Definitely will next time.

It's a bit overpriced but well worth it."}
{"text":"This is a place with nice fancy food and lots of options (salty and sweet)
I ordered a waffle with strawberries and whipped cream. It came with some chocolate ganache to add and some crunchy chocolate chips.
Having said that it has some downsides:

The waffle was perfect but too small taking into account that it cost 12 dlls (including taxes). The portion is ok maybe for a dessert but not to be considered a breakfast.

The waitress was polite but not quite there and not very helpful. She looked bored and seemed to be in a hurry to take my order and I don't like to be rushed in restaurants. She didn't even say \"hello \" or \"bonjour\" haha 

The \"ambiance\" was too sterile  not cozy with bad music and lots of noise from the other tables so I gave up in my intent to stay there and read my book 

I don't think I'm coming back which is a shame because the waffle was delicious  :("}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, with a creative and satisfying menu. We loved everything we tried, the hot chocolate comes with a cream pot-sized refill, and is literally drinkable chocolate. There is a salad dressing option that includes cocoa- based dressing. Mmmm!"}
{"text":"Desserts were fantastic! We had both the chocolate and caramel crepe. Out of this world!!!!

Only reason why I don't give it a 5 star is because the service wasn't the best. It took almost 30 minutes to get our order in and we had to flag down the waiter to pay."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find out that Juliette et Chocolat expanded to a few more locations! The first time I went was 5 years ago at their St.Denis location. This time, I went with four other friends to their St. Laurent location. I ordered a chocolate hazelnut fondue to share. The portions are quite large - a few of us had difficulty finishing. It's a wonderful place to hangout with friends while enjoying some yummy chocolate dessert. There is also a patio area for those who want to enjoy their dessert outdoors or for those who have dogs!"}
{"text":"If I was living in Montreal, I would be a regular customer. This place is awesome!

I've been here a few times and I've fallen in love. Juliette & Chocolat has a very clean, bright, cozy and chic décor. The place is big and can seat many people which I like about the place. The staff is very friendly, but most of my visits here I was suffering through the service.

This restaurant offers uniquely flavoured chocolates from different countries with great quality. You have the option of having your chocolate grandma style, classic, milk, white and dark with any order that has chocolate. They also have chocolate cocktails which I absolutely loved! I had their choco-mojito and snow white (see picture). My choco-mojito consisted of chilled dark chocolate with a splash of cream mint liquor topped off with whipped cream and crushed mint candy on top in a martini glass. My snow white drink had chilled white chocolate with baileys with foam and a dust of cinnamon, also in a martini glass. 

Other great chocolate or tooth decay options they have are a variety of crepes that come with either fruits, chocolate, ice ream, caramel, maple syrup and more; pastries, fondues, brownies, chocolate shots, variety of ice-cream etc. Everything is made with love and the presentation of the food is very nice too. What I love about the chocolate at Juliette & Chocolat is that their chocolate is not overly sweet to the point where it gets nauseating, it's just chocolaty in a very pleasant way.

Although this place is big for their chocolate, there are non-chocolate options too that I had the pleasure to enjoy. Their savoury meal options were my favourite! I love their pesto complete- buckwheat crepe stuffed with your choice of ham or turkey, your choice of pesto and egg with a side salad. Their chicken spinach with goat cheese was very good too- buckwheat crepe topped with spinach, good amount of warm goat cheese and tender strips of chicken with a side salad. Furthermore, I also had their Mexican salad which was uniquely delicious- mozzarella cheese with juicy chicken on mixed greens, served with crispy buckwheat chips and pineapple salsa.

The protions are great and food was consistent, fresh and delish each time. The prices are reasonable for what you receive. It may seem a bit pricey, but you're paying for the quality. 

Overall, Juliette & Chocolat is an amazing restuarant! Expect everything except great service-service is very slow. My advice would be not to come here if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Terribly long service 
Got half wet napkins 
The smoked salmon crepe is ... Lacking smoked salmon and the smoked salmon is very fishy. Not the salmon you expect 
I'd say pick another spot for lunch"}
{"text":"I came to this cafe 3 times before writing this review.  I cannot tell you how excited I was that a Juliette et Chocolate was opening in my hood.  I really, REALLY wanted to write a good review, but I am afraid, after giving it 3 tries, I simply cannot. I've broken up my review by visit, the final being the \"nail in the coffin.\"

Visit 1: Ordered two brownies. They were pretty tasty, but my friend said that they didn't heat the brownies like they do in Montreal.  The bill took a good 45 minutes to get to us once we asked for it.

Visit 2: Ordered hot chocolate.  It was thick and delicious, but it was lukewarm for me and my friend.  My friend (a different one) was disappointed because she said the Montreal one served the hot chocolate HOT.  Service was slow, as was how long it took for us to receive our order and bill.

Visit 3: Ordered some round chocolates (holy cow, they are 4$ each!!!).  I took them home as a gift for my mother.  They were terribly disappointing.  I've made chocolate by myself before and have an inkling of what it should taste like.  The chocolate crumbled into your mouth; it did not melt.  The consistency was chalky and there was far too much sugar in the chocolate.  The peanut-coated one had expired peanuts on it (there was a rancid odour and taste to them).  Now, I'm not one to complain about cost but the pricing was unjustifiably bad because of the poor quality of the product.  I paid a good 22$ for a box of 5 sugary, crumbly \"chocolates\". To be honest, I feel like this establishment ought to be ashamed to call itself a chocolate shop after eating chocolates like those.

I will not go back unless one of my friends convinces me to go back, which is an unfortunate possibility... (sigh)"}
{"text":"Always a line up
Expect long wait
Place is always packed
Expect to hear the gossip of the other tables

But chocolate lovers: it will all worth it....

It's no surprise this chocolate store became a chaine. Go there for the old fashion milk hot chocolate (a must year long but even more in the winter, their crêpes with your choice of chocolate and their grand cru of chocolate drinks. 

A date place or girls night!"}
{"text":"For all you chocoholics out there Juliette&Chocolate is the place to get your fix.  My personal favorite are the chocolate shooter glasses. It is beyond heavenly. If you take the Fondue and hot chocolate you might overdose but I assure you it's worth it."}
{"text":"Best way to land in coma.  The chocolate experience is unique and undeniable.  There are actually chocolate samplers like at brewery or a wine tasting."}
{"text":"I am in love.

I'm as much a feminist as the next person, but walking into this place and inhaling that warm chocolaty smell, I could just feel all my PMS-related bitchy-meanness melt away and my uterus and ovaries physically relax. Honey, we're home!

I had the milk chocolate hot chocolate, classic style and it was fabulous. Despite the 'classic style' being more creamy/milky than the 'grandma's style,' it was pretty syrupy and chocolaty. Sweet, creamy, chocolaty... hold me.

My boyfriend had the white chocolate crepe and liked it a lot. He said it was a little more white chocolate than he would have liked, purely because white chocolate is so sweet, but that yeah, he would go back and have more crepes.

Minus one star because the staff weren't overly friendly. I'm not asking for a hug, a kiss and a Christmas card, but smiles would have been nice. And how could you not smile when you get to wear one of those awesome hats every day??"}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant on Saturday at 8:00pm.

The food was really good.

The service was awful. After ordering our food took over 30 minutes to arrive, and when it did, the ice cream had already melted. I tipped the waitress 10%, only because I'd feel bad not tipping at all. 

The restaurant itself was very loud! It was not a pleasant environment.  People were screaming and it was really hard to have a conversation with the people at my table.

Never again... Not worth it for that price"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times.  This place has great deserts, but the service is LAME. Slow, non attentive, and rude.  This place can easily be 4 stars if not for the service."}
{"text":"DO NOT give this place your business! We had planned to have our daughter's 1st birthday here and called in advance to make a reservation for 16 guests. We called again to confirm and all was fine as we had rented the small 2nd floor space for the gathering with family and friends. We arrived the day of her birthday, July 7th, about 20 minutes before our guests, to decorate a bit and get settled and there was a sign on the door saying they were closed from July 3rd until the 16th! No phone call, no warning and our guests were on the way. We were absolutely devastated. We gathered all of our things, balloons, gifts, etc. and had to frantically run up and down the street with our little one, searching for a back-up. It was a nightmare. We had heard this place had gone downhill in recent years, but I had celebrated my bridal shower there and really liked the space and service. Things have clearly declined since then. I'm beyond disappointed in this business and have never been treated, or mistreated, rather, in such a shameful and unprofessional way. :("}
{"text":"Great choices for decadence 
Serve was imppeccable 
location was easy to find"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most reliable place in town for chocolate, crepes and a little chit-chat. Read more on http://theforbiddenmeal.com/2014/10/14/juliette-et-chocolat-a-rediscover/"}
{"text":"Look, there is only one thing on the menu: chocolate. If you share my love, that's all you need to know. But once you walk into this restaurant, you will understand that what you previously understood could be done with chocolate was just child's play. Pass through Juliette and Chocolate's doors, and you have walked into the ranks of the MLC -- Major League Chocolatiers.

While everything contains chocolate in some way, the menu is amazingly extensive, and incorporates so many different elements that a trip to their website is recommended, as I cannot describe them all here. We only ordered one item which we split, the Trifle, at first glance was a tall coffee mug with layers of whipped cream and brownie. On the side, melted dark chocolate (no sweetener added) was served in a small pitcher. Poured on top, the sweetness of the cream and brownie bites enhanced the chocolate, while the unsweetened chocolate tempered the sugariness of the Trifle. Just an amazing presentation and wonderful dish. I need to go back and try everything in this place."}
{"text":"First we wanted to go to an other place, but there was a crowd. We decided to go to have breakfest here. It was a great idea. We ate a pesto and a banana pancake. Both were great. I truly suggest this place not just if you like chocolate."}
{"text":"On a rainy afternoon in April, I was with a group of 25 international students who wanted to do something special to celebrate a classmate's birthday. The spontaenous choice of the birthday-girl was a chocolate restaurant, and as we were close by, we stopped in at this J&C. With no reservation, the friendly waiter accommodated our entire group, effortlessly switching into English with them. As I myself do not have much of a sweet tooth, I just had tea, but my students tried various things from the menu, and all seemed very happy with their choices. We didn't have to wait long for our meals to be delivered. A surprise mini-cake with candle and singing was brought at the right moment to the birthday-girl, and everyone left happy. There was a small mix-up with one of the bills, but this is the nature of dining in huge groups and overall I was really happy."}
{"text":"Overpriced. No. WAY overpriced. But their chocolate and crêpes taste so good. Still, ridiculously expensive. 
The atmosphere is very boring. And I am really annoyed that they make crêpes right where people eat, not in a kitchen, - smoke hurts my eyes a lot. If you wear contact lenses, be aware."}
{"text":"Was really not great. Service sucked. Crepes were not bubbly they were lumpy.....pretty gross. Kinda rubbery. Water was warm and it took forever to get fresh, and then to order........too much energy for not even a great dessert. I know it's a staple here supposedly but so not worth it. Save your cash and go to a place that isn't a chain for a dessert. They don't have the time to make it good."}
{"text":"- Horribly cold impersonal service 
- the staff evidently lack organization at first glance
- Chocolate fondue was served stone cold - what's the point!
- Hot chocolate tasted more like a sickly sweet drink that vaguely resembles chocolate 

I was so excited to try this place out but was sorely disappointed.

BOTTOM LINE : if u have refined taste buds, give this place a pass!"}
{"text":"I love their hot chocolate, so thick and rich ... their chocolate crepes are yummy too. You may have to wait to get in sometimes. If really busy, the service can be not amazing. The bathroom are not always clean especially if they are more busy. Overall, this place is a chocolate heaven and a very unique experience :)"}
{"text":"During our long weekend trip to Montreal in February, I told my hubby that I really wanted to eat crepes! So of course the first place we checked to find crepes was yelp and they suggested Juliette et Chocolat. 

Juliette et Chocolat is a lovely modern cafe with lots and lots of chocolate all around.  It looked like everyone had a pot of chocolate! Being a chocoholic...I was excited indeed! 

Both my hubby and I ordered crepes with strawberries but when I was scanning the menu, the trifle caught my eye.  

The crepes were ok...I thought the crepes would be folded into a triangle but it was like a large crepe with chocolate spread on top and sliced strawberries on the chocolate.  Nothing special. And to be honest, the strawberries weren't ripe but then again, it's February....not July so really I guess it couldn't be helped! 

The trifle on the other hand was absolutely the best thing I put into my mouth that weekend.  I am still dreaming about this trifle to this day.  It was basically layers of brownie, fleur de sel caramel, whipped cream and then you pour hot chocolate overtop.  AMAZING! Every single component of this dessert was heavenly.  I was never one to really like whipped cream (I immensely disliked the one on Chinese cakes growing up) but then I started making my own whipped cream and realized how good it tastes...and the whipped cream at Juliette et Chocolat was like that whipped cream...homemade and fresh! SO good! 

The five stars is honestly for the trifle...it was that good.  I will definitely be going back there to put some more heavenly trifle into my mouth!"}
{"text":"J'ai visité cet endroit avec ma blonde.  Nous avons toujours voulu essayer ce restaurant mais nous avons été très déçu. Service médiocre. 

Le restaurant est très beau et très bien décoré. Le Chocolat était excellent.  Toutefois Leur service laisse à désirer.  La serveuse n'avais pas le goût de nous servir.  Elle nous a assigné une table sale,  nous lui avons demandé 2 verre d'eau qu'elle nous a servi chaud de l'évier sans glace n'y rien.  Nous n'avons pas oser de lui demander d'autres eaux puisque j'avais l'air vraiment de la déranger.  Nous avons entendu un bon 20 minutes avant qu'un serveur vienne nous voir, il a décidé de venir nous voir quand on était sur le point de partir.  On a eu un autre service douteux par ce serveur qui aimait mieux parler avec tout ses collègues ...  

Bref,  pour tout cela nous avons décidé que nous ne retournons pas.  Trop cher pour le service."}
{"text":"Nice desserts and nice atmosphere but don't go here if you don't speak French because they will give you bad service -- moved us to a table by the open door in -30C weather and seated a French speaking couple at our original table"}

{"text":"Guilty vacation pleasure... the hot chocolate is like nothing I've ever tasted before.. I wish there was one in the US"}
{"text":"Both the savory an sweet crepes were phenomenal. The portions were appropriate, and you pay for the quality. Yum!"}
{"text":"Meh... this place looks better than it tastes.
Came for brunch and tried the crepes. They are okay but overpriced for what you get.
The hot chocolate was too sweet for my liking.
It definitely doesn't compare to similar chocolat places I've been to in Paris lol."}
{"text":"CHOCOLATE! how can it not be 5 stars? I kept it simple last time I was here and had the crepe with dark chocolate. Others on the table had fondue, banana split, and hot chocolate. All of them looked very good, and taste as good as they look! If you love chocolate, go to this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome deserts with a large desert menu. Savory crepes are pretty good themselves. Service is decent when they are not to busy otherwise you can end up waiting a bit for everything. The hot chocolates are awesome and how hot chocolate should be. Try one grandma style, thick, rich and creamy. Worth checking out if your in mile end or outremont."}
{"text":"Our first night in Montreal was insanely cold. After walking in the cold after dinner for like 15 minutes, JW and I decided to have some nice dessert before fighting the cold again on our way back to the hotel. Once we entered the Juliette et Chocolat, the lively and happy atmosphere quickly warmed us up. I instantly knew that we would have a good meal here!

We ordered fruit, melted chocolate and ice cream crepe. It was one of the best crepe I have never had in my life. First of all, I like it when the fruits and ice cream are placed on top of the crepe and not wrapped in the crepe because you get to eat everything at the same time in one cut. Most importantly, you get to see the pretty presentation all the dish.

There was A LOT of different kinds of fruits (at least 7!) While the bitterness of the dark chocolate helped to elevate the flavour of the fruits, the ice cream added a moderate amount of sweetness to the crepe. Therefore, we were not too overwhelmed by the crepe.

We also ordered the chocolate fondue duo. How could one not order chocolate at Juliette et Chocolat? We ordered extra-bitter and milk chocolate, hoping to get an equal balance of sweetness and bitterness. But we liked the extra-bitter a lot more because, again, it helped to bring out the flavour of the fruits. We found the milk chocolate to be a little too overwhelming.

As one might probably assume, banana and any kinds of berries, (strawberries, blueberries and blackberries) go really well with chocolate. Although there were a lot of fruits (pineapple, green apples, apples, grapes, organes, kiwi, pears)  and they did go with chocolate, we still liked banana and blackberries the most. We could not finish all the fruits after eating all those from the crepe.

conclusion:

roasted!

if you are in Montreal and if you like chocolate, you should absolutely visit Juliette et Chocolat.

{"text":"C'est beau, c'est bon, c'est varié et même souvent à modeler soi même mais on ne va pas se mentir : ça reste plutôt cher pour ce que c'est. 
Cependant le cadre est sympathique, le service agréable et rapide et on y mange bien. La carte est très grande, un choix énorme de chocolats chauds, de crêpes, de gaufres, de brownies, possibilité de fondue au chocolat ou toutes autres pâtisseries en tout genre (et cela, sans vous parler de la carte salé.) J'ai donc mis beaucoup de temps avant de me décider pour une gaufre fraises sirop d'érable, mais je n'ai pas été déçue!"}
{"text":"excellent homemade chocolate and deserts.
always busy with after dinner guest.
you can by the chocolates at the bar for take out if it is too busy.
friendly staff"}
{"text":"Where should I start? Maybe with the Chocolate chaud a la Grandmere which is so thick that it leaves a trail akin to that of lava. Or perhaps with the Fleur du Sel Brownies that contrast the tang and bite of sea salt with the richness of caramel and the complexity of dark chocolate.  Or maybe I should focus on the savories.  The buckwheat crepes filled with layers of spinach and Gruyere or served au complete. The salad with their twirling garnishes and chocolate inspired dressings.  Whatever you get, it will be amazing; that's why I've embarked on a mission to order every single article on the menu.  

The new location is very convenient located on St. Laurent Boulevard, close to the hustle of downtown and the urban hip Plateau.  During the evening, you may have to wait over an hour to get a table; however, if you go during the day, you're likely to be seated immediately.  

The service is decent, but not spectacular.  The waitress sometimes disappears and doesn't return for long lengths of time.  In order to place order, get waiter, or request the bill, you'll often have to hail someone down. 

However, what Juliette et Chocolate lacks in service it certainly makes up for in the menu.  They serve a variety of hot chocolates, savory buckwheat crepes and salads, sweet crepes, ice cream sundaes, brownies, and other pastries.  Last time I was there, we ordered buckwheat crepes and split a bottle of cidre brut.  The buckwheat crepes are light yet hearty, perfectly complemented by a green side salad.  Prior to that occasion, I've also had a dark chocolate-banana crepe, chocolate molten cake, more buckwheat crepes, a crepe flambé, an original brownie, an \"intense\" brownie, a fleur du sel brownie, and a dark hot chocolate \"a la Grandmere\".  All were delicious, decadent, and very rich.  

Overall, I love Juliette et Chocolate.  The service is slightly frustrating, but the overall experience is amazing.  For the best value, get a brownie.  They're decently cheap (not more than you'd pay in a coffee shop), beautifully presented, and wonderfully good."}
{"text":"The brownies are excellent with a nice exterior crust and moist center. Service can be slow, but if you stay on top of it- eveything will be fine. If you're paying with a credit card, you will pay at the waiter station- no wireless terminals, yet. The interior is nice, bathrooms could be much better (multiple holes in the walls that could be easily patched and painted) and they should be mindful of where they place the the baby chair, which was pratically left in the middle of the room. The Grand Cru frappés are huge- One each, is overkill (11$)- split it and save your money to try something else for variety. I will hold myself back from making a joke about women who substitute lack of sex with chocolate binges at this chocolate emporium. But, I will say this... parents do what you want, but you're not doing your kid a favor buy treating them to an obscene insulin spike from the glycemic index of these chocolate treats that contain high amounts of sugar; you might as well serve them a cup of beer- it has the same, negative, hormonal effect on your child's mind and body-a rapid spike in insulin response. Disturbing still, was a young pregnant women gorging on three different types of chocolate delights- poor baby! (Chocolate, hangover alert in the placenta). If you think sugar is innocent, think again. This place is rated PG. And you're saying,«What? You won't allow your kid to eat chocolate or sweets?»- ur damn right, not until they're old enough to read and write. How did this turn into a parenting anecdote? Well, let me see: don't complain about your kid not being able to concentrate, talking loud, yelling and running around like a maniac... If I gave YOU half a litre of Redbull to drink in 15mins... I don't think you would act any better as an adult. Think about it..."}
{"text":"Heaven and a HALF for any lover of sweets. I don't think there is anything bad here. There is cute decor, excellent service, and so many good chocolates. I MUST come back soon. It's a great place for an afternoon hot chocolate, bring your date or your child, or your mama!"}
{"text":"They microwave their brownies and they have no problem with it?!! The waitress said they didn't have ovens, in a DESSERT restaurant!! 
I didn't expect the stuff to be terrific or anything but I surely didn't see I would be so disappointed... Very impressed, in a bad way.

Je me suis laissé séduire par le brownie \"Le Pacane\", la version chocolatée de la tarte aux pacanes. Le dessert tant attendu m'a été servi 20 minutes plus tard, pour moi le gâteau est plus proche du moelleux que du brownie mais cela n'enlevè rien à la dégustation qui fut sucrée et gourmande.

Ce goûter en terrasse fut agréable couronné par un service parfait !"}
{"text":"This place is the perfect place for chocloate lovers. I come from the US and i wish there was a place like this in my city. This is literally a chocolate heaven."}
{"text":"Went here on a first date and this place is awesome! They have options for everyone! Whether you're craving sugar or savoury or you want something hot or cold, they have it! I ordered the banana strawberry Nutella crepe, it was good but got a bit too sweet near the end. The servings are also really small for the price which is why I took a star off. Otherwise, I'd recommend Juliette et Chocolat!"}
{"text":"Service - THIS IS NOT A DEAL BREAKER FOR THE JOINT
- No acknowledgment at the front when you walk in for at least 5 minutes
- Once served, the staff is great

Food
- All desserts came out hot and delicious 
- Presentation of desserts were great
- Taste were all phenomenal

**Tip** on any brownie, top it with vanilla ice cream

Atmosphere
- On the weekend, it feels like you are in high school
- Not a deal breaker

This review would have got 5 stars if we were acknowledged faster."}
{"text":"You can buy their hot chocolate to go, which is a nice souvenir to bring back. I got their milk hot chocolate and dark hot chocolate. I recommend diluting it with double the amount of milk though, otherwise it's too sweet and rich. The price for both cans was $26 after tax which is a great deal! I wouldn't give it a 5 star though because it wasn't the best I've had."}
{"text":"Okay, so the menu is spectacular. I've had things here that I never though could be done with chocolate. From hot chocolates to ice cream to more elaborate deserts, I've yet to try something here I didn't like.

However, it is (unsurprisingly) very busy, and wait-times for a table can be long. So while it would be a great date spot *in theory*, something gets lost in translation by the time you get a table and finally get served.

I wouldn't do it on a first date, but it might be a fun place to end a night with someone you know well, especially after dinner."}
{"text":"This place changed my life. I'm not a huge dessert person but I would go back to this place for every meal if I could. All of my friends absolutely loved it and would definitely recommend it to anyone going to Montreal."}
{"text":"A restaurant that focuses on chocolate? Hmm I must try this! Again we went with the French side and each ordered something different. I ordered the Balsamico: chocolate brownie with strawberries in a basalmic reduction. I was expecting a brownie with strawberries on the side. Instead I got a brownie with strawberries on the inside. It was good, just a bit gritty. -1 for that. Also the waitress kept forgetting to bring the drinks that we had ordered. My friend ordered a milkshake but he never got it. Weird.... -1 star. 3/5"}
{"text":"Chocolate: good. Service: horrible.  

And there are plenty of other amazing desserts around Montreal.

We've been to many establishments in Montreal where the staff really put in an effort.  This was the opposite.  There had to be at least four wait staff there, but after being seated, we waited for 15 minutes for an opportunity to order, before giving up and getting something to go from the counter.  And even then, we waited five minutes to pay for it.  The table next to us came in just after us and they were still waiting to order when we left.  I don't know what the staff were doing, but it sure didn't appear to be waiting on the customers.  It's not like they were so busy and it was 10:00pm."}
{"text":"This is a must eat place! The desserts are phenomenal! The staff is very friendly and helpful in explaining how things are prepared and which are the best of the best. The raspberry sorbet is delicious. The crepe is so large, I nearly had to be rolled home! Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Je ne sais pas pourquoi j'y retourne encore autre que pour leur brownie au caramel salé qui pourtant, n'était pas aussi bon qu'à l'habitude la dernière fois. 

Chaque fois que j'y vais, le service est plus que lent et il arrive toujours des choses désagréables desquelles je ris, mais tout de même! Des exemples? Une fois, j'ai reçu mon verre de lait (commandé 45 minutes plus tôt) une fois ma facture payée (sur laquelle j'avais, bien sûr, fait retirer le verre de lait en question). 

Ce qui s'est passé à ma dernière visite (lundi dernier)? 2 des personnes avec qui j'étais ont dû se lever pour laisser passer deux des employés qui sortaient de gros sacs de poubelles en accrochant tout sur leur passage 3 heures avant la fermeture du restaurant... Plutôt déplaisant.

Bref, on y va quand on a nulle part où aller, mais la qualité des produits est inégale et le service est terrible."}
{"text":"Oui l'idée d'un endroit (salon de thé ?) spécialisé dans le chocolat est sympa.
En pratique, c'est bourré de monde (la rançon du succès), le service est lent, la salle est très bruyante.
Mais surtout, la carte proposée n'est pas si extraordinaire que cela. Le brownie cheesecake est juste moyen, les glaces sont ok mais sans plus, les chocolats chauds sont bons, ce qui est quand même la moindre des choses dans ce genre d'endroits."}
{"text":"Chocolate fondant and Banana boat crepe were awesome (deserved 5 stars) but the service was poor! The waitress could not/did not want to speak English! I spoke English to her but she responded in French! I told her I can't understand French but she kept on talking in French! The food was late! Not enough napkins, forks and spoons! Disappointed with the service but liked the desert so much!"}
{"text":"The sweets were great! They had such a diverse offering, which made it difficult to decide what to choose. The service was so slow, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Le paradis!!


 Idéal pour une sortie entre fille. Un bon film au ciné puis un petit tour chez Juliette & Chocolat.


 C'est tout simplement délicieux. Crêpes au chocolat, fondues au chocolat, pâtisseries... (vous pouvez tout de même prendre un dessert non chocolaté), tout est un régal!


 Bien sur on ne compte pas les calories, on se fait plaisir!!!


 Il y a souvent la queue à l'entrée, mais ne vous laissez pas décourager, entrez et vous ne le regretterez pas!"}

Good for lunch.  We had the sugar crepe and the crepe Provençal. They were great

High chairs for kids.  Friendly waiters.  Great service.  Beautiful decor"}

{"text":"Décadent. Divin. Miam!
Cela décrit bien mon expérience chez Juliette et Chocolat!
:P"}
{"text":"Uncompromised quality service, good atmosphere good food. Additionally, the wife is always happy when we come here and you know what they say: \"A happy wife is a happy husband\". It's hard to find parking on the weekends though so have that in mind when you come."}
{"text":"Kinda cool. Certainly the desserts - I had an amazing brownie - are the highlight. Very good mocha, too.

Two crepes were ordered. Both savory. Both made with what seems to be canned vegetables: potatoes and spinach. The ham was tasty but I guess I was expecting something richer. The Gruyere was average.

Prices are reasonable. Attractive, bright dining space. Very polite service. 

There are 3 locations in the city. I believe this is a good intro to French breakfast food. But if you're a foodie, the meals won't impress. It will feel like a French Panera Bread with many more hot chocolate choices."}
{"text":"First time here, I had the sugar butter crepe! That was amazing. I ordered the grandmas hot chocolate and was expecting a drink but it was more like thick syrup. It was very hard to drink it. Busy atmosphere, popular place and wide variety on the menu."}
{"text":"This place was great for a late Sunday night outing for dessert.  If you like chocolate, you will be in heaven.  i thought it was a little over the top.  i ordered profiteroles, which I find are always served with a small pitcher of good chocolate to pour on top.  These profiteroles were literally drenched in a pool of chocolate that had the consistency of magic shell mixed with cement.  Seriously, the stuff got stuck to my fork and would not come off, and I could not eat it off.  it was rock hard and made eating a little annoying.   Have you ever eaten with a cement-dipped fork? if so, you know what I'm talking about.  BF's nutella crepe was much better, and understated.  We each had a hot chocolate as well, the spicy hot chocolate was not good-over the top spiciness that completely took away from any chocolate flavor.  
wish i had tried something else, I may have liked it better than what i ordered, but it was fun to see so much chocolate on one menu!"}
{"text":"My sweet-toothed chocoholic travel companion adored this place.  I thought the mousse and ice cream sandwich were sickeningly sweet for such an expensive place ($8 ice cream sandwich).  To each his own, I guess."}
{"text":"A crepe place with savoury as well as sweet options. The service was a little brusque. The savoury creeps are not worth the visit. Spinach and egg very overcooked on both fronts. Overdone spinach and solid and meagre egg. When the waiter took the leftovers away and asked about it, we expressed to him our poor opinion about it and he walked off without responding."}
{"text":"I came here on the suggestion of a friend.  Clean, bright, lots of servers, chocolate heaven!  My friend and I didn't get great service either.  They forgot her order!  I don't like if you want to sit at a table you have to have wait service.  I'd rather order my drink, pay at the cash and than sit down.

It was the most expensive hot chocolate I have ever purchased $6.37.  Was it good?  Yes.  Would I have known any better if it was a different kind of chocolate?  Probably not.  But anyways, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"If you're a dessert and/or chocolate fanatic, this is the place for you!! The fondue was incredible, and there is such variety on the menu for any dessert lover. The quality of chocolate is awesome and the experience great all-round."}
{"text":"This place is a must for chocolate lovers.  
Their brownies are to die for - slightly warmed, so they melt in your mouth, moist and drizzled with a little chocolate sauce.  The crepes are good and the desserts are ever so decadent and well crafted in their use of sweet, salt and chocolate as well as different food texture combinations.  
That said, sometimes the service can be very slow, so this place is not a good choice if you are in a hurry.
There is wifi, so it makes a nice place to study."}
{"text":"If you're looking for crepes, cross the street and head over to Cafeteria. But if you're searching for chocolate heaven, you've found it.

On our weekend get-away to Montreal, we stumbled upon some of the best brownies we've ever had. Juliette et Chocolat is pure, unadulterated decadence. A favorite was the Chocolate-Caramel with extra caramel sauce for dipping or simply pour it over and yum! 

The brownies were so good we went back for extras to take back on our drive home. Full disclosure: Only 2 of 3 made it back home; the third didn't survive the drive back. So good!"}
{"text":"The hot chocolate was amazing. The taste platter was good and really enjoyed the fondue. Was expecting to feel sick from the chocolate but it was actually good in that respect. The sweet portions were small enough to enjoy without overloading your senses. The atmosphere was likewise enjoyable: not too quiet not too loud. Overall, a five star chocolate experience."}
{"text":"Mediocre. It was loud, took over 30 minutes to get our desserts and when they arrived it was not as good as I had expected. Overall, I was disappointed and wouldn't go back. Total waste of calories."}
{"text":"Profiterols.. are amazing.  Service is great, pleasant environment and easily accessible location ."}
{"text":"Great way to finish off your evening.  Loads of chocolate. We over ordered and did the chocolate crepes and the chocolate almond bar.  The lava cake was delightful.  The area is great with cool bars and clubs all around to scope out later"}
{"text":"Didn't have a chance to try it unfortunately. We waited around twenty minutes at our table and no one came to take our order but there were five servers standing around chatting at the front so we left!  Keep in mind I've worked as a server for over five years"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while whenever I go on family vacations to Montreal. I absolutely love the atmosphere, the chef hats that the workers wear (along with friendly service), and ...CHOCOLATE! Oh the fondues and crepes, yum yum yum!

This is definitely the best place to get crepes (you won't see just Nutella as the only \"chocolate\" topping here!)! I would love to come back here when I visit Montreal next time~"}
{"text":"My best friend and I came to Montreal for a long weekend with hopes of trying every kind of cuisine the city could offer. We stumbled across Juliette & Chocolat on our first night and made sure to return before leaving town.

Upon entering, you are immediately smacked across the face with the rich, warm, welcoming smell of good chocolate. The shop is clean and well lit with defined areas for dining in, having a quick coffee, or purchasing items from the bakery case.

On our first visit, my friend had the Juliette sampler, a plate with a bite of five different desserts. I ordered a Viennese coffee and the intense brownie. The coffee was delicious - hot and flavorful with an abundance of real whipped cream and a dark chocolate drizzle. The brownie... I can't even begin to describe the sinful richness. It was as if every taste bud had an orgasm.

On our other visit, my friend had the sundae and was quite satisfied. I initially intended to have the intense brownie again, but then I noticed something even better: the intense brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate ganache. It. Was. HEAVENLY. The brownie was warm, so the ice cream was melting into it. The ganache was perfectly rich without being cloyingly sweet. I would have licked my plate clean if I wasn't in public.

Overall, an extremely pleasant experience both times."}
{"text":"Food good. Service excruciatingly slow. I just wanted to get out before the food was served.

Plenty of open tables in the restaurants, five minutes to be seated, 10 mins for someone to come to clean the dirty table and menus and water, 15 mins wait till i had to hail someone down to take our orders. 25 mins for first food. 20 mins more for three scoops of ice cream."}
{"text":"I have been to Juliette et Chocolat a couple of times, mainly when it first opened in Montreal a while back. Every time I go I seem to have the same issues:

1. orders take A LONG time to come out. I always find myself waiting, whether we are a large or small group.

2. the food is not exceptional. just average I would say.

3. It feels like a chain. It is trying hard to blend into the zeitgeist of Montreal's unique cafes and terraces, but it isn't. It uses cheap finishes and bad decor that are a far cry from the warm ambiance that is truly a unique Montreal joint.

I avoid going to these restaurants and am really surprised that they are getting such great reviews. I will try again seeing these reviews, perhaps they have changed in the couple of years I haven't stepped into one."}
{"text":"A busy dessert place where the staff wear big goofy red chef hats and thick rimmed glasses. It's bustling - a good place for groups and chatty dates. I had one of the many chocolate drinks and really didn't taste the unique flavour that was touted on the menu (I suspect they all taste the same). It wasn't as dark and rich as I expected. I think Soma Chocolatiers in Toronto makes a better chocolate drink.

The crepe was pretty good but didn't really stand out to me. I took a few bites of the peanut butter and chocolate.

Reliable place for dessert anyway when you're on St-Laurent post-dinner. Nice decor though a bit hotel-like."}
{"text":"Worst crepes I've ever had. 

Unless you like eating cardboard, I have to advise against Juliette et Chocolate. We ordered 3 savory crepes, all of which were terrible. They were almost empty and had no flavor. Had been planning on ordering sweet crepes, too, but we left after eating just a few bites to have dinner elsewhere. These were by far the worst crepes we've ever had."}
{"text":"Great food and service 

The Nutella hot chocolate will put you in chocolate coma, very rich , not for the weak hearted :) 

The Mexican crepe with chocolate BBQ chicken taco ... yes you read it correct , is really tasty and yes it's a fiesta. 

Sadly they stopped doing the profiteroles, so instead To end the feast we had straight forward chocolate crepe, and it was home run.

Again great food and very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Dont even think about going to Montreal without coming to this spot, and if you already did then Im sorry you wasted a trip. I like to call myself a chocolate hoar , and as a new yorker I try my best to maximize on my chocolate affairs ;-). But I found love in Montreal, unfortunately I don't speak French and it would be tough to relocate guess I'll just keep my chocolate hoaring lifestyle until I meet Juliet again. The quality of chocolate is amazing and assortment of desserts including Crepes which is my fav. I cant say nothing else , you just have to try it.

{"text":"Amazing brownies and desserts however, I feel the need to point out that this place is very much so over priced. Brownies are $4.50-$6 a piece!!! 

Definitely a once in a while splurge."}
{"text":"Best place ever !

Went twice, once alone with my best friend and once as a group of 5. Staff is SUPER friendly and makes jokes and laughs along with us. They also know their menu very well.

The food is amazing ! Last time, we had the Fraisinette (crepe with strawberries, white chocolate and vanilla ice cream). It was so good we decided to order it again this time. We also ordered a chocolate milkshake, a fondant, a brownie and the brownie degustation (5 different bits of brownies on a brochette). It was all SO good ! The plates are really cute and the 5 brownie bits came with melted chocolate in a tiny jug, it was just so so cute.

A scary hobo came in and tried to ask us for change and a member of the staff promptly shooed him out before he could even finish his sentence. Very attentive and quick to react !

The prices are also very fair. Will recommend to everyone I know and come back again !"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmmmm.  I had a crepe filled with milk chocolate and a scoop of hazelnut ice cream.  Next time, extra scoop.  That's the only way to improve on the otherwise perfection.  And in the middle of a busy Saturday night, the wait was very short, and our server was all smiles, extra attentive, and running back and forth to get us extra napkins and a plastic bag when our leftovers made a bit of a spill."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the concept of the place and the server was lively and entertaining. However as a venue,  it was too hot and the service was unorganized. We had the fleur de sel chocolate mousse pot and profiteroles.  The pot was unexpectedly small, and the profiteroles portion much larger. The mousse was a little runny perhaps because of the heat. The profiteroles were tasty but slightly overcooked as the shell was hard to break and a little dry. Will try the crepes or some more popular dish next time."}
{"text":"The crepes are not always freshly made which is a shame when you know how fast a crepe takes to cook! 
When i come to juliette et chocolat its for the hot chocolate, my favourite is the mangaro, 65% hot chocolate from Madagascar, it is thick, decadent and hit the spot every time!"}
{"text":"Super bon brownies maison a un prix raisonnable (aux alentours de 5$ sans tax) , 1,50$ supplements chantilly. Le service est au top . Le chauffage un peu élevé mais parfait pour passer un petit moment pour le goûter."}
{"text":"To sum it up in one word: average. 

This place is nothing special. I came here with a group of 7 ppl and since it was earlier in the day, they had room for us but otherwise I wouldnt recommend it for more than a group of 4. We each ordered crepes. My mushroom crepe was average. I've definitely had better. My big issue is that all the savory crepes come on buckwheat only. You can taste the texture and flavour difference and I would've preferred a regular crepe instead. The salad dressing was some kind of balsamic but this balsamic in particular was very offensive and I couldn't eat it at all. Service is slow but kind...at least for the servers who can speak english."}
{"text":"Although I agree with some of the previous comments about few staff relative to patrons, my waitress was always smiling as she passed me, and she even was patient with me as I practiced my french.

This place has very creative deserts.  Where else, now seriously, have I ever even imagined seeing chocolate makeup as an option on the menu?  

I had a crepe with nutella and banana.  And, the waitress gracefully took the whipped cream off of the bill when I said I thought it had been included (as it was in the picture of the desert on the menu).  Given my unsteady french, it probably was my mistake to not confirm it was included, and yet I appreciated her understanding.

Super cute restaurant, and it is defiantly a good bet to share a few deserts with friends."}
{"text":"How can you say no to chocolate? That was exactly what I said when I drag our group into this cute little chocolate store on the corner of the street. 

We were greeted in french and a sweet chocolate scent. 

There is a huge glass counter by their entrance that holds various kinds of chocolate truffles, treats, cookies, etc. There are so many different choices, but I was close to making a decision, until I saw more glass counters in the back of the store, with cakes, mousse, pies, and more!! I went to the back of the stores and there were different brownie, cake, pies, tiramisu, cakes, mousse, pies, did I say cakes? It doesn't matter how many circles I walked in front of these lovely sweet treats, or how many hands prints and nose prints I left on their glass case, I finally decided on 4 things, all for myself, of course. Bf can get his own.

their tiramisu is comfortably nested in a cute little glass jar, it's so cute that I didn't want to open it. Ok, I'll save it for later.

the chocolate mousse is the shape of half a dome, and covered with a layer of chocolate. I dug a fork into it and it collapsed because its center is filled with super moist cake, creamy chocolate mousse and a layer of hazelnut cream. I took a bite, then another bite, then another. Bf can keep staring at me, like I said earlier, he can get his own.

Of course I bought a piece of nutella brownie, how can you say no to nutella brownie?? and a piece of pistachio hazelnut brownie, because it's right next to the nutella one and you can just one by and not the other. It's not polite to make any one of them feel left out. These are not your regular store brownie. There are super moist, rich, but not overly rich to make you feel disgusting, they are just right, and extremely satisfying. Of course there's no sharing.

There's also cheesecake brownie. Who came up with that idea? cheesecake + brownie! I saved it for later but it disappeared before I get to try it!

It was a bit confusing since everything is in french, but chocolate is chocolate, no matter which one you choose, it'll be good! Especially the goodies from Juliette!"}
{"text":"We had the classic waffle and squirrel crepe. 
We just loved it. 
It isn't very sweet, which I appreciate. 
Very nice staff."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have never been anywhere like it. We had an enormous chocolate crêpe and a dark chocolate milkshake. Both were incredibly delicious. Our only complaint was that we went through our water pretty quickly and it took us a while to get more. It's a good thing I don't live near this place, or I'd be here every day..."}
{"text":"I've spent a lot of time at this Chocolate Cafe.
Free wifi and chocolate, you can be entertained for hours!

I used to drive out here because I didn't like the location on Saint Denis.
Too many students and bad service.
Well, this location had fewer students.

This place is great to take a date or friends visiting from out of town!
I used to always get the hot chocolate with ice cream (insert the fancy French name here) and the salted caramel brownie (insert the fancy French name here).

Pear and dulce de leche crepes,  fondue is fantastic!
Flambe crepes... a bit more booze than crepe.. but you are in Montreal after all!

They even have salad with chocolate dressing!
There are a lot of things I'll eat chocolate off of, but lettuce isn't one of them.

Great dessert place though :)"}
{"text":"Seriously wonderful hot chocolate. I stopped here three times during my weeklong stay. The Nutella one is disappointing with the Nutella largely getting lost in the mix. But the three chocolate mix of 33% milk, 33% dark and 33% white is just dreamy. And the Viennese is also wonderful. Plus the famous brownie lives up to the hype. Heaven."}
{"text":"Honestly, worst service I've ever gotten. We stood at the door for 15 minutes and the waitress made eye contact with me 3 times and still chose to ignore us. I had to go up to them and ask if they were closed before she decided to seat us and she gave us attitude. Worst service EVER."}
{"text":"I went back again the following day, but it was closed. They don't open till 11AM. BUT WOW!!! my first time here my fiance and I ordered the fleur de sole crepe and a balsamic vinegar brownie. BOTH were amazing.

The crepe was very well textured, and the sauce had an amazing salty, almost like salt water taffy, flavor and the stickyness of caramel. 
The brownie was extremely rich with a few raspberries in it. It had a delicious balsamic vinegar drizzle over it. 

I would both these again in the same sitting. They both complimented each other so well. One sweet and salty the other bitter and slightly acidic. Soo Soo Sooo good."}
{"text":"Après un excellente pause cinéma, nous avons trouvé refuge, pour le plus grand bonheur de nos estomacs, dans cette antre remarquable.

Remarquable par son cadre lumineux et son personnel bienveillant. Mais également par la qualité de sa carte et de son large choix, tant au niveau des desserts qu'au niveau des chocolats.

Pour ma part je me suis contenté d'un brownie qui s'est révélé vraiment très très bon. 

A ne pas manquer si vous aimez le chocolat!"}
{"text":"Walk in and ask for a hot chocolate, Grandma's Style. Also get a macaroon (we got the maple glaze/nuts macaroon). Walk out EXTREMELY PLEASED AND SATISFIED.

Seriously, the grandma's style hot chocolate is so thick and creamy and delicious, it hit the spot on a frigid night in Montreal. The people working here seemed genuinely nice too, which was great.

Yum."}
{"text":"The rich smell and beautiful bright decor let you know right off the bat that you're in for one decadent experience.  I came here not once, but twice with a friend when we visited Montreal this weekend. 

The first visit I had the Juliett Sampler. It gave a great overview of all their menu items, and was very filling. The next visit I had the Sundae, which includes brownies, vanilla ice cream, bananas and strawberries with a mountain of whipped cream on top. It was a meal in itself! 

I would recommend their fondues, ice creams, and brownies. Based on the sampling of their crepes and waffles, I would say that is not their strong suit. Its a little pricey, but definitely a place to go for a fancy chocolate experience!"}
{"text":"This is a definite come to for chocolate and sweet. They have an endless menu of things to choose from. But they also serve savoury crepes and waffles. I got a savoury crepe with some spinach, ham, cheese and it was good. The only thing I can say is that the crepe batter was a bit dry and too much at the end. But great for chocolate."}
{"text":"Best milkshake ever.  Take the dark one.  The milk version taste funny.

Best hot chocolate.  Take traditional and dark yummy!"}
{"text":"I love stopping at a Juliette & Chocolat when I'm in Montreal! Lots of sweets that you can indulge in, but also plenty of savory foods that you can enjoy. My sister had a pulled-pork savory crepe and it also came with a dessert and drink. I had a Nutella crepe that seemed to have some type of hazelnut ice-cream on it too. Absolutely delicious. As for the area, you have to find street-parking and hope for the best, but you usually will find a block or two away. We came on a Sunday and it was crazy packed, so be prepared to wait a while for a table!"}
{"text":"My balsamic brownie could have been a tad more balsamic, but sheesh- when's the last time you had a balsamic brownie?"}
{"text":"On a short weekend trip to Montreal, we just knew we had to stop into Juliette et Chocolat - and we certainly were not disappointed! This place has a coffee shop feel to me because they serve desserts, crepes, hot drinks, but at the same time offer full meals and entrees. There were lots of large groups of friends catching up and at the same time pockets of tables that looked like dinner dates or friend catch-ups. The star of it all though was the food - particularly the chocolate. absolutely sinfully delicious! Rich, creamy, dark - light, frothy, dilectible...the choices span the entire gammit. I would come back in a heartbeat to try it all over again!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings for this place. We ordered crepes & coffee. The coffee got to us AFTER our crepes did, and it was the worst burned coffee I've ever had. The crepes, on the other hand were  delish! We had the Nutella & the turkey, spinach, egg & cheese. I felt really bad for our over-worked waiter- Julien. He was waiting on about 15 tables which is why the coffee took so long to get to us. Giving 2 out of 5 stars because our waiter was nice and the crepes were good but it seemed the be very disorganized."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. I have been here for desserts mainly, and it never disappoints me! I tried a couple of different options, they were all good. The petit pot options are great if you just want a little sweet to go.
The ambiance is not that special, I feel the place could have more personality. The staff is pretty good overall."}
{"text":"This is one of those times when I wish there were two different ratings, one for service and one for food. The food is awesome. I've been to this location several times and everything I have ever had has been amazing. Granted, you have to like chocolate, but if you do, heaven! This visit I Le Medley Fleur de Sel, that consisted of a scoop of vanilla ice cream atop an intense brownie, served with a little pot of caramel sauce to drizzle. So good! And the perfect portion too, not so large that I felt sick, but enough to feel satisfied.  My companions had a Grand crus hot chocolate, a fancy cocktail, and a crepe.  Everyone was quite happy with their choices.

The service though . . . terrible. Pleasant staff when you can catch them, but they always seemed to be busy doing something else. It didn't seem to be for lack of staff, there seemed to be many employees working. We came in and waited what felt like a really long time to be seated, while there were many empty tables. A quick \"hello, we'll be with you shortly\" would have gone a long way instead of feeling ignored. Same thing once we were seated, friendly when someone was with us, but we sat for long periods of time waiting, whether it be to give our orders, or to get our bills and pay.  It was such a strange feeling.

We had brought an out of town guest with us, to show her something uniquely Montreal, and it didn't disappoint.  I love the Laurier location, for the high ceiling and big windows, very pretty.  The price is right too, when you compare how expensive a fancy drink at a bar can get.  This is an occasional indulgence, so quite fine.  Our guest's immediate reaction upon leaving: \"Was the service ever bad!  Is that common in Montreal?\".  But the next day, all that remained was the memory of a delicious experience, so all's well that ends well.  So four stars it is!"}
{"text":"Imagine that a brownie and a piece of dark chocolate fudge had a love child.  You will then have the mouthwatering dessert from Juliette et Chocolat that is, in my estimation, the best brownie of my life.  My husband has enjoyed equally delicious crepes.  I've found the service to be a bit lacking in the late evening (overwhelmed staff perhaps?), but the desserts here are beyond compare. This is definitely one of our favorite guilty pleasure spots in Montreal."}
{"text":"Ok. I feel its unfair for someone like me who doesn't have a sweet tooth to comment on this place but here goes...

I was at this place with two people who love chocolate, on of them being Mr. H. We walk in and there was a little bit of a wait to be seated. I was shocked at the number of people who came here to eat a meal of chocolate! We sat down and were given the very large menu of options. It was a bit too much of me so we went with a sampler and Mr. H tried the Peru chocolate drink. The sampler was the perfect size and we got to try a bit of everything. It had fondue with some brownie (the brownie was superb!) and some fruit. There was also a small crepe, a profiterole and some vanilla ice-cream served with whip cream. The ice-cream with whip cream was the most in quantity and it was also what was eaten the least. It was nothing special and I would much rather have had a larger portion of the brownie (somehow in platters the also serve more of the mediocre dish). Mr. H did not enjoy his Peru as much, I think it was too fruity for him (it says its fruity! hello!). I think I would have enjoyed this place much more had I come after dinner and not middle of the day. The chocolate fondue was not the best I've had but the brownie was really good. 

I don't know if this is a place I would crave to go to again, maybe if I wanted to try the crepes I might.

PS: i still can't get over people coming here for dinner!? I guess that's something only chocolate lovers will understand."}
{"text":"I love love love chocolate and this place fulfilled my chocolate craving and then some. The milk chocolate crepe with strawberries and bananas was amazing! They also have chocolate alcoholic beverages as well as gourmet hot chocolate drinks. I will definitely be back here again soon!"}
{"text":"I had their hot chocolate and chocolate fruit fondue, and they are amazing. Their ingredients are always fresh, and the chocolate they use is not something you can find in the supermarket. Their crepe & ice cream is a delight.

I never tried anything other than desserts there, but they do offer sandwich and wraps. The place is very cozy, however it gets quite noisy at night since it can accomodate lots of people."}
{"text":"Alright, seeing all those great reviews for this place, I think I probably went on an off-day.

Went there with 5 other friends, and they were all served except me. I waited 20 minutes for a glass of hot chocolate because they forgot my order. My friend also found a hair in his crêpe...

On top of that, given the poor service, the waiter was pretty rude at me when I left a very small tip (good service = lots of tips, bad service = little tips, sounds fair?).

Probably will never return and will stick with the one located on Saint-Laurent."}
{"text":"Chocolate cafe? Oh yes! Very cute shop with a huge intensive menu related to chocolate! I ordered a milk chocolate called \"New Guinea\" paired with a little chocolate-banana brownie. I would sip the chocolate drink and take a little bite of the brownie. It was superb and must be enjoyed slowly. I mean, what's the rush anyways? Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The best deserts and service are here. Their green teas are delicious, and their brownies OMG. i have tried lots on their menu, and ive loved everything so far. The place has that cozy vibe especialy when its cold outside. If you have a sweet tooth, just go there"}
{"text":"On prépare ma crêpe bien avant que mon amie reçoive sa commande qui demandait plus de temps à préparer! Je vois mon plat être sur le comptoir et les lumières pour le réchauffez semblaient brisées, car après 10 minutes d'attente, ma crêpe était complètement froide! J'aime Juliette et Chocolat, mais je recommande d'aller à un autre que celui sur Saint-Denis! Toujours une longue attente et les plats sont rarement chauds, plus tièdes.."}
{"text":"One of my very best friend took me there once last year and I fell in love with the place. The lineup is always very big but it is worth the wait time 10. The place it clean and very bright a bit cramped up but after tasting the food you forget about it. The service is also a bit slow but I can understand because the place is always packed. I tried a few of the sweet treat (dessert) but I have not yet tried the meal. Everything I have tasted so far was AMAZING and even that word doesn't make the food justice. You have to try it BUT be careful because it is very addictive and also without a doubt very sweet."}
{"text":"Amateurs de chocolat? ...Qui lève la main? ...Hein? 
Je vous direz que c'est à cette adresse qu'il faut se rendre. Le choix est large en chocolat, mais pas seulement! On peut y déguster des crêpes salées (sans ajout de chocolat!). 
En plus de ce qu'on peut y déguster, on y trouve la toque des serveurs qui est assez accueillante, on peut dire!"}
{"text":"I have been here so many times that I am eventually getting tired of it (I'd be very glad if they actually put some more salty side options as additionals), but each experience has been gratifying. I personally love the white hot chocolate during winter. Highly recommended for severely depressed people."}
{"text":"Someone recommended that we come here during our visit to Montreal. There was an assortment of pastries, chocolates, and drinks to have there or take out. We both got a semisweet chocolate shooter. It was rich, creamy, and delicious, and just the right size. It was a shot glass size. We bought 2 sauces to take home, salted caramel and chocolate. I will come back to edit after we have tried those items."}
{"text":"A tous les amoureux du chocolat et des ambiances cosy, c'est l'adresse incontournable pour un bon goûter. 

C'est une chaîne à Montréal, mais je recommande particulièrement celui-ci, sur la rue Saint-Denis. La petite terrasse est très agréable lorsqu'il fait beau ... Les crêpes salées sont également très bonnes.

Je recommande la crêpe poire-chèvre frais-miel ... à jamais gravée dans ma mémoire."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dessert on a dreary Saturday. Boyfriend opted for the single origin Peru drinking chocolate - so creamy and fruity (sounds weird but it's good, I promise). I wanted the s'mores (because s'mores is my immediate choice). This isn't a traditional take, but their version is just as good. A chocolate cookie crust, topped with caramel custard and a torched marshmallow, all set on amaze balls melted chocolate. I wanted to try so many more things on the menu but we just didn't have time. I'd definitely be back if we're in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"The place: nice but not \"WOW!amazing!\". Just regular! Really pretty style but personally despersive. A lot of people going there. At 7o clock it was almost full. WELCOME: the waiter who received us at the beginning was annoyed. As we preferred a table to the one he gave us he was manifestly bothered! The second waitress was vitriolic. The third just interested to let us pay. SALTED DISHES: really good even if the salad wasn't fresh. The BROWNIES: special! I took the one with nut. Yummy, dense, really good percentage of chocolate, bits of crunchy nuts. I'll try it againfor and again for food! Really special."}
{"text":"Perfect coffees and perfect French crepes. Very understanding servers who did not seem to mind as our baby screamed through breakfast (sorry, everyone else patronizing this establishment)."}
{"text":"I loved this place! We had a waffle with banana, nuts, salted caramel and I'm not sure what else but it was delicious! We were sad it didn't last long but certainly enjoyed it. My boyfriend ordered a mochaccino and he loved it too. The service was also quick! My only disappointment was the chocolate \"milkshake\" which was more like chocolate milk than a shake. Regardless, next time I return to Montreal I will stop by again for more!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! 

If one loves chocolate, Juliette is a MUST! Yes, it's a small chain, but it's such a great vibe that one wouldn't know without doing research. 

I noticed in some of the recent views, some complain about service ... but our service ON Quebec day was FAB-U-LOUS!!! Could not be more attentive and charming. 

Choices are limited here and all chocolate in some form. We loved that they had a section for drinking chocolates -- much like a wine selection. We opted for the Madagascar mango chocolate - comes in a HUGE cup and while thick was just the perfect viciousness to drink (plus not too sweet)! We could not finish so took it to our place and put it in the fridge to become a very smooth mousse drink for later!! :) 

Also had their nutella, banana, and strawberry crepe which had that rich eggy texture of a trrrrue crepe!! =) Crepe comes with a piece of their select chocolates!


A true chocolate aficionado find! ** pst -- check out their store up front.  they have a section devoted to the passionate chocolatier with a love for kuma sutra =P"}
{"text":"Yum! I came here super late and they close at 11pm so if you ever need to satisfy a craving come in for some food! I came in at 10:40pm and they were only serving brownies at this time. I got the caramel sel de fleur brownie and it was soooo good. My mouth was watering when I first saw it. There was sauce (salted caramel) that was on the side that you could pour over onto your brownie. The only downside to Juliette and Chocolat is that it can be a bit overpriced for some of the things you get. The total bill came to $7/8. It's good to come here once in a while!! It's also good for birthday celebrations and generally large groups of people!
The second time I came here I got the crepe. It was too good to describe. All I ask of you after reading this review is to go order it NOW."}
{"text":"We just ordered drinks and desserts.. We loved everything!! Staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"After living in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and NJ where the quality of food is very good due to competition, we have pretty high standards when it comes to food.

A definite must!!! Desserts are fresh, delicious and not excessively loaded with sugar!

We ordered the chocolate fondue with fruits and the trifle, which were both phenomenal!!! Even the quality of the fondue fruit were delicious! (note: for 2 of us we ordered fondue for 1 and the trifle...we realized if we had ordered the fondue for 2 with the trifle, it would have been too much food after we had dinner. )

This place was so delicious that we came back the next day! We ordered the hazelnut praline and once again were impressed.  I love how you don't taste any preservatives or fillers and how fresh everything tastes!

Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic dessert spot for chocolate lovers. Very good choice for dates or for coffee and sweets. I wish there were more places like this.  I prefer the semi-sweet hot chocolate which is delicious.  This is a great place for groups and the seating is ample.  Keep in mind that there can be quite a line at times. There's another location on Rue St-Denis but I like this location better personally as the layout is more spacious."}
{"text":"De très bons chocolats chauds et autres gourmandises mais tout n'est pas à la hauteur. Certains chocolats chauds sont trop sucrés alors que d'autres sont trop amers, après il ne s'agit peut-être que d'une question de goût.

Le service peut-être très long et l'endroit n'est pas très chaleureux. 

En hiver quand t'as froid et que tu as vraiment besoin de réconfort ici tu peux en trouver dans la nourriture, seulement le réconfort a un prix certain !"}
{"text":"Salade excellente et bon dessert, malheureusement le service laissait à désirer : une seule serveuse pour tout le restaurant en pleine après midi ensoleillée. Débordée..."}
{"text":"While I can say that the chocolate ice cream was damn near close to the best ever and the chocolate and pecan mouse will knock your socks off...the service lacked so terribly that I can't help but give 3 stars.

 If you would have thrown it to the ground and passed a plastic fork...we would have still eaten it and cried in endless joy but that's not the point. It COULD have been a wonderful experience, one of the best but you screwed me Juliette. Get your chocolate coma staff a shot of espresso and a tad bit of direction and you'd have yourself a true gem."}
{"text":"A Max Brenner meets The Chocolate Room. Best way to describe this place. Touristy, but still with quality food. A chocolate lover's heaven. We witnessed long lines at both locations, about a 20mn wait the night we came in.

They serve different assortments of hot chocolate (white, milk, varying degrees of dark) from many countries. We settled for hot milk chocolate. Since we weren't too hungry, shared a chocolate cake with ice cream on the side. Cake was very rich, decadent, delicious. Great choice!

Con: terrible slow service. Overpriced meals"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I stumbled upon it accidently while on a vacation in Montreal.  They serve crepes and bubbling hot chocolate, an ingenious combination that anyone is going to like.  They have a menu of hot chocolate options, all ultra-thick and rich.  They bring it to you in a steaming carafe, and you leisurely pour and drink your way to paradise.  I liked it enough to go back a second time on my short visit.  

(Side anecdote: I overheard another patron begging the owner (?) to let her franchise the store in the Middle East.  Why not?  Love it.)"}
{"text":"There are a few locations of Juliette et Chocolat around Montreal. We enjoyed eating at the St Denis location as it's a good people watching spot. The buckwheat crepes are good. The dessert we got was fabulous. Server was very personable and fun. Overall, a great place."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people rave about this place . If you are from a city that has good food and desserts (NYC, SF Or Toronto) you are going to be disappointed with this place. Go to any boutique bakery in Montreal and you'll have a great experience. This is just commercial stuff, poor quality."}
{"text":"Ever thought of managing your chocolate cravings? Well, i think it becomes impossible when you try one of the most renowned restaurants in montreal.

Juliette et Chocolat is a pastry shop famous for their chocolate bar, but there is a lot on the menu such as savory crepes, pastries, brownies, intense shots. and many other delicious chocolate based desserts...
Chocolates offered are great vintages with unique flavors, served Grandma Style or Classic Style

Located in different places (quartier latin, Laurier ouest, St Laurent, and St denis), one cannot but smell the chocolate when passing next to the place, I've been there a couple of times and every time i'm amazed by the quality of service, and the hospitality of the waiters wearing there red French style beret.

The Best things about Juliette et Chocolat are the Fondant au chocolate and the Hot Chocolate. Specially made for the place.. The Brownies are a dessert to try as well..."}
{"text":"I got the mango hot chocolate and my date got the Mexico hot chocolate. Both were tasty and I liked that you could actually taste the difference between the two drinks. We also got the Balsamico Brownie which was divine. The brownie was rich and airy at the same time and went very well with the the balsamic vinegar reduction.

Our waiter was very nice, but the service was a bit spotty (nothing too egregious though). I definitely want to come back and try their other offerings. They also have a bunch of merchandise for sale up front."}
{"text":"Juliette & Chocolat is honestly one of the best desserts in town. I have been there over 10 times but I'm always curious to try out new things from their menu. From the salty buckwheat crepes to the sweet ones, I've literally loved everything I've tasted at J&C. 

This time my friend and I respectively had a chocolate banana crepe and a salted caramelized banana crepe. Again, delicious! 

Also, every time I have been here the service has always been outstanding and the place, neat. Would 300% recommend."}
{"text":"Ma visite chez Juliette & Chocolat (Laurier/Parc) m'a appris que le cacao est presque aussi complexe que le vino. Moi qui voulais un simple chocolat chaud (d'ailleurs, chez J&C, on ne dit pas «chocolat chaud», on dit un «traditionnel»), j'ai dû répondre à une tonne de questions afin de savoir le type de chocolat désiré, la façon de le préparer, le niveau de «thickness», etc. Il était bon, certes, mais j'avais plus l'impression de boire une fondue de chocolat ou un pouding; je l'ai d'ailleurs «bu» à la cuillère, au grand désespoir de la serveuse.

Les fondants au chocolat au caramel à fleur de sel sont fous !

Très dispendieux par contre."}
{"text":"Grandma style hot dark chocolate, paper thin crepes made before me or fresh puffy and crusty, just slightly oily croissant.

Extra shot of espresso to kick start the day in Montreal.

Perfect!"}
{"text":"This place use to be good
But now they started getting stingier on the quantity and quality
Here is an example of before and after over a year.
This is chocolate madness"}
{"text":"Horrible experience....our dessert order was delayed, my coffee was forgotten....couldn't even get a straw after it was asked for on many occasions....definitely won't be coming back. Ruined my Montreal experience."}
{"text":"- to be fair, i only had their chocolate fondue
- points for giving customers the ability to choose what type of chocolate to use (milk, dark, etc)
- minus points for the fondue for just being a bowl of melted chocolate with fruit to be dipped into."}
{"text":"One of my wife's favourite spots to stop at whenever we visit Montreal. Truly delicious and wonderful way to experience different types of chocolate with plenty of classic and decadent ways to enjoy. Be warned it is easy to overdo and a chocolate coma hits hard. I tried the chocolate fondue for 2 set with my family and it was a very generous assortment of fruits, brownies, waffles and marshmallows to dip in super rich and thick chocolate fondue that melted in your mouth and gave you a little sugar coma with every bite. Very tasty but really decadent and powerful as well. I also tried a pure Aztec chocolate drink made in the ancient way with water that was believed to give strength. A rich and spicy flavour, almost like cinnamon or ginger spice with that antioxidant flavour but still creamy and smooth as it poured down my throat. Really great experience and I look forward to exploring the menu more when I get a chance to return. Nice classic layout and excellent staff as well!"}
{"text":"I think this place has become pretty legendary in recent years, this particular location is spacious and the drinking chocolate is always a good option. The service is just whatever, but the desserts are the best in town."}
{"text":"Very bad service. Took very long in a Sunday afternoon. Portions are small and chocolate is average. Cacao 70 on park is a much better option."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Their hot chocolate is out of this world! My son had milk while I had dark hot chocolate. We also bought chocolate mix to bring with us to the US. Lunch is very nice also - salads, crepes etc."}
{"text":"wonderful selection of hot and cold chocolate drinks, along with variety of milk drinks. 

we shared the dark chocolate and praline fondue, and white, milk, and dark chocolate swirl fondue with fruit platter and the sweets platter. oh we also got the banana split. it was all great. we didn't think we could finish it all, but we did, between the 4 1/2 of us. 

I will definitely go back next timw we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"I come here often and thought I should give a second review on some new items I've tried. This time I ordered the hot chocolate with house made marshmallows and caramel fondant with ice cream. WOW - the caramel fondant has become my new favourite. Perfection in every bite - Sweet, but not sickening sweet. Portion size was just right. Pairing with ice cream is a very good idea. 

As for the hot chocolate - again, very thick and delicious. It's sweetness level is just right for my partner and I. I really liked those marshmallows too. Very soft and warm. My partner treated me, and he was telling me how good the price is for such good food (It just became his new favourite dessert place)."}
{"text":"I just LOVE this place! From the moment you walk in, you can just smell the greatness!"}
{"text":"Just as the stars say... As good as it gets! The chocolates were beautiful & delicious! The best part? Other than the cute servers, great waitresses, cute chairs and delectable treats... It wasn't over priced! Such a lovely experience."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal and my friends and I decided to stop here for dessert. I ordered a delicious treat called \"The Cafe Gourmand\" (a single espresso served with sweet whipped cream, a small chocolate lava cake, a small raspberry cheesecake, and a bite size fleur de sel brownie) 

Great atmosphere. Open fairly late. In the middle of a great town with lots of restaurants. Great servers."}
{"text":"Ice cream sandwich was amazing!! Soft chewy cookie with delicious ice cream. Definitely worth the dipping!"}
{"text":"I went there with high expectations but I will never go back . It's a very very
overpriced place and the portions are no bigger than one mouthful of dessert . All the desserts there are like that . I see that the place has a high star rating but I am truly baffled by this . It's probably due to the fact that the place looks nice and the one bite that you get , does taste good . But remember , it's ONE bite . Literally !!!!  ....... Followed by a 100 bite wallet grab"}
{"text":"Yes 5 stars don't thing twice GO. The most creamy, thick, amazing , FLAVORFUL, rich luscious chocolate that had ever touched my palette . And I'm talking about the hot chocolate I got the traditional with a tiny bit of milk but I never saw the milk it's absolutely outstanding. If you love chocolate and dessert you need to experience this place . I've been craving this ever since I've been home ! I would go all the way back to Montreal solely for this !"}
{"text":"Ouf! Gosh darn I miss this place, now that I dont live in Montreal anymore!!

You dont underSTAND how unbelieveably amazing this place is, if you've never been!

Crepe with dulce de leche and pears = Perfect perfect perfect! 
Fleur de Lys Petit Pot = Holy goodness.. Heaven in my mouth!!

Counting the days till my next visit!"}
{"text":"Oh Juliette et Chocolat. I have spent countless evenings here sitting at a corner table catching up with friends, laughing, eating and drinking all things chocolate. The wait has sometimes been long - the place is so popular that lineups used to be out the door, even when it was chilly out. 

Their menu is nothing short of indulgence. They have profiteroles, salads, crepes, fondue, brownies, shots of chocolate, hot drinks, you name it, they've got it. Such a unique place you dont appreciate until you leave Montreal, then you find yourself CRAVING! But anyway! I digress! 

Its no secret I love Juliette et Chocolat. But this location probably the least of the other two. This is the smallest, so it is very cramped, and it takes years to get someones attention to order. 

Nonetheless, still one of my favourite spots in Montreal.


23/30"}
{"text":"It is a good place to indulge yourself . If u see a lomg line, just relax. It wont take u long for them to get u a table. Highly recomended"}
{"text":"If you are a chocolate lover you can not miss this place.  

I don't have a sweet tooth myself but I this was my third trip to Julliette et Chocolat (twice @ this location and once at the other close by location - different review for that).

The size of this location definitely helps with creating a nice atmosphere.  The staff are friendly although service can be a bit slow.  Both times we were seated right away and didn't wait long to have our orders taken.

In my initial visit I had ordered a savory chicken, spinach and goat cheese buckwheat crepe and the nutcracker drink.  I recall this combo being delightful.   On my most recent visit, I ordered a tea, along with a sweet Nutella, banana & strawberry crepe.  The crepe was light, fluffy and big enough - just right.  What I was disappointed with is the quantity of the toppings especially when I had paid extra to switch my chocolate to Nutella.

They do have WiFi at this location, which I hadn't used, and they accept credit cards for payments.  Their menu can be found on their website and lists the other chocolaty treats they offer aside from the crepes."}
{"text":"I definitely prefer the location on St Laurent Blvd a lot better than this location.  Despite the high reviews for this location, I was pretty disappointed.

The location itself is small and tight.  The server we had seemed very uncaring and not very knowledgeable.  The service was pretty slow.

We ordered a savory chicken, spinach and goat cheese buckwheat crepe with a latte and a sweet semi-sweet chocolate strawberry and banana crepe with the nutcracker drink. 

When we had initially inquired if any of the drinks came as hot beverages our server said no, we later found out that the nutcracker was served warm.  When we finally got our order after a long wait, my friend asked if she could have olive oil for her salad or any other oil type dressing, our server said they didn't have anything like that and the best he could do was maple syrup.  We later saw three bottles of oil & vinegar in their prep/cooking area.

The quality and the portions at this location were not consistent with the St. Laurent location.  I am glad I had tried the other location prior to my experience here, otherwise I would've most likely written of Juliette eh Chocolat and never returned."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places!!! I was expecting amazing things from here and I was not disappointed. 
My boyfriend and I shared a savory crepe and a sweet one. I forgot the names but the savory was raclette cheese muchrooms ham and the sweet hazelnut icecream white chocolate whipped cream and strawberries. Absolutely amazing! I also got a chocolate drink. This caramel \"drink\" more like delicious melted chocolate in a glass with whipped cream on top. I don't even want to think about the amount of calories. So worth it!
Service was okay. I kept asking the waitress what this is that was everytime someone passed by with another delious plate. She was very nice and always answered me. 
Only bad thing. The amout of people and the heat. Obviously this is a popular place and the line was already very long at 6pm. And we were basically dying of heat inside. Also the water is warm which really bothered me. But this is nothig compared to the amazing food."}
{"text":"Waited for 1 hour after ordering and still did not receive our order or even have any waiter or waitress come by in that time to check on us. Terrible service. Very unimpressed. Walked out after an hour of waiting. Ridiculous. We ordered a dessert in a jar stored under the counter which should takes no preparation to serve. Go to Rockaberry instead. Seriously. I went to rockaberry right after this experience because I still wanted dessert. Was served immediately and she gave us a free extra piece of cake because she hadnt sliced it perfectly. Amazing."}
{"text":"Si vous aimez le chocolat, Vous adorerez!! Les brownies sont sublimes, les coupes glacées sont généreuses... Tellement de choix irrésistibles!! Les portions sont parfaites pour une personne. 

Pour accompagner le dessert, ils offrent un excellent choix de thés en feuille. 

Les prix sont raisonnables pour ce qu'on obtient. Nous y retournerons, c'est certain!!"}
{"text":"Two of us were craving chocolate and this hit the spot. We got a few mini popsicles, as well as the classic waffle. Both were well made, and our waitress was nice. We sat in our the back section (the resto was full), and it felt a bit dirty as there was dried chocolate on our table."}
{"text":"Gonna keep it nice and simple.
NOPE!

Walked in...kept walking no one at the counter, no one anywhere.
Finally some waiter at a table in the back gets up from eating his meal and decides to seat us.

Either ur looking for a waiter to help and they are no where to be found, 
or there are two of them literally filling ur water glass at the same time.
Service was slow to non existent, the food was cold at the moment it got to the table, my girlfriend's hot chocolate arrived cold as did my watered down espresso.

We were at a table with two extra spots next to us and the waitress seats two more strangers basically at our table. Everyone was kinda feeling awkward since we counted over 23 free tables in the place.

The actual place is very nice but the staff is clueless slow and incompetent. 
The first thing we thought was the place was really nice looking but new staff and management is a must for this place to survive...which is kinda sad since it's relatively new.

Not going back.
Cacao 70 wins my business over this place any day."}
{"text":"Had the vintage hot Chocolat-peru and a Chocolat fondant. Woah! So so so delicious. Best chocolate desserts in Montreal!"}
{"text":"All you chocophiles, hold your breath: Juliette & Chocolat has finally decided to open a location on the south shore! 
I was so incredibly happy when I stumbled upon the Café/Boutique in the middle of the new \"Square Dix 30\"! The sitting area is quite large, and MUCH less crowded than the Montreal locations, which is a huge plus. Given that J&C is a chain, the desserts obviously live up to the expectations. This time, I decided to go with the chocolate fondue duo, and went with Milk and Very Dark chocolates. Mouth watering, scrumptious, delicious!
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been going for years and it's still good and always so busy and that's a good thing for the employees and owner! As for me I would go again! No regrets!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the dessert here. It's always delicious, the portions are big. Whichever desserts you choose, they are all good, rich and very satisfying."}
{"text":"Autre succursale de la chaîne assez bien connue. On y trouve le menu habituel : centaine de sortes de chocolat chaud, crêpes sucrées et salées, fondue au chocolat, etc. C'est bon au goût, mais un peu cher compte tenu de ce que c'est réellement.

Les employés sont toujours hyper sympathiques et souriants, sauf que le service peu être lent parfois. Ce qui me marque chaque fois que j'y vais est que c'est tellllllllllement bruyant. Puisque cette succursale est située en plein milieu du quartier Dix30, elle est assez achalandée... et par conséquent, c'est extrêmement bruyant. Ne vous y rendez pas dans l'idée de passer un moment tranquille en amoureux. 

Vous y trouverez certainement votre compte si vous voulez vous sucrer le bec après votre séance de magasinage."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of deserts in the first place but came after hearing some good things about the place. The cafe was much larger than I had expected and it was more of a sit down deserts restaurant. The place was loud and lively, and was perfect for our raining evening. 
I didn't find the deserts to be exceptional, and were too sweet and way too dense in my opinion. In retrospect I would have gotten a lighter drink or a crepe of some sort. I ordered the Petit Pot praline-caramel but the waiter got the order wrong and served a different one instead. They did catch it soon enough and brought me the correct order though and were very apologetic about it. Otherwise their service was great and quick fast. 
This may be a place for all you sweet tooths out there but is not somewhere I see myself returning to."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often only due proximity to where I live and the long hours (closes at 23h00). 

Of all the Juliette & Chocolat sites I've been to (including St. Denis & St. Laurent) this was the loudest in noise. Mostly populated by youngins - a Bieber concert you won't be able to hear yourself unless you sit in the outdoor terasse area. Parking is available because it's central location in a shopping area. You don't need reservations for this place- most of the time you will find a spot. Service is SLOW be warned even to pay. I was not impressed with the service. Food quality is sub-par comparable to other sites. I still like the the St. Denis site as my favourite one.

For the summer - there are some new additions to the menu including the Juju pops! Available in Mini and regular sized- assorted flavours like vanilla, Nutella, salted caramel and speculoos (Belgian cookies with cinnamon as the winter described it). You get to choose extra toppings for an extra cost. I got the mini vanilla milk chocolate coated with Carmel popcorn and the spéculoos both were light and great flavours!

I still would not come herw unless it was my only option available after your plans cancel out."}
{"text":"had the banana and chocolate crepe and they did NOT skimp on the chocolate. YUMMMMMMMMM SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!! my friend ordered a salad that had some crepe on it and it was delicious too - it had fruit and it was just all nicely presented. 

ordered something from the chocolate bar too - the dark and milk chocolate drink w/ ice cream. again, very good."}
{"text":"Went here a few times when I had those sweet night cravings! I loved this place that my friend introduced to me. Its a cute little place and has a sitting area outside which I prefer, if its on a summer day since it gets very warm inside. I had milk and dark chocolate fondu which came with a loaded fruit platter and it was delicious. I also grabbed their brownies and tiramisu the other time I went, and it was addicting. I will definitely come back to try their crépes and chocolate milk!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Juliette et Chocolat.  The food is always flavourful and I've been a loyal customer for over a decade. What I really can't stand is the ridiculous wait times each and every time I go. The Laval location is much faster but then again I've only been on down times. Dix30 in Brossard needs better management to control wait times. I got here at 12h15 and despite 3 different servers seeing me, none acknowledged my presence until 5 minutes later. I sat down at 12h20 and they took my order at 12h30 and I just received my crepe and coffee now at 12h54.  If they would bring the beverage within 5 minutes, it wouldn't feel like you're sitting there for an eternity. Getting anyone to come after you receive your food is always a chore and getting the check is a pain. Don't come here if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"OMG THIS PLACE HAS THE BEST CHOCOLATE!!!!! 

I ate here three times out of 4 days I was visiting montreal :) I had a chocolate milkshake, chocolate and fruit fondue, hazelnut ice cream with fruits crepe and a viennese coffee...ALL WERE DELICIOUS!!!!

you have to visit this place when you go to montreal!"}
{"text":"Le goûter chez Juliette et Chocolat......
Le chocolat dans tous ses états et de toutes les provenances.....c'est ici! 
Petite recommandation, commander un super chocolat (Blanc-lait-noir ou grands crus ) ainsi qu'une pâtisserie ou fondue au chocolat, même pour les adorateurs du chocolat, devient très vite écurant!
Préférez commencer par l'un ou l'autre.....afin d'éviter d'être rassasié en cours de route et d'être obligé de tout laisser dans votre assiette ou votre tasse....
Pour une première découverte, je recommande absolument la fondue fruitée avec au choix 4 chocolats différents!
C'est fabuleux!
D'ailleurs si ça vous a plu (et je n'ai aucun doute là dessus!) vous pourrez tenter de revivre cette expérience chez vous, grace à la boutique Juliette et chocolat!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dessert with another couple. I ordered my usual favorite fleur de sel brownie and my husband was feeling adventurous and ordered the red velvet cheesecake brownie. We were told that this was an off-menu item especially made for Valentine's Day so we were curious to try it since we are usually fond of red velvet dessert. What a big mistake! Not only did it not taste like red velvet anything, it was stale and hard! There was a clear difference in freshness between what the rest of us had ordered and this. My husband and I are not at all picky and we had never sent food back before but this was just not edible. Our friends even tasted it and agreed. Seeing that Valentine's Day was three days ago, we politely asked the waitress if this brownie was also three days old because it tasted as such. She proceeded to get her assistant manager (who by the way, had her paperwork spread out all over the table not far from us, it was like her own personal office). The assistant manager then asked us what the problem was and so my husband explained once again, very politely, that this not fresh and tasted horrible. By the look on her face you would have thought that this was her own personal recipe and she had baked it herself. She was clearly offended and kept insisting that she was very shocked because a lot of other customers had ordered it and loved it. We tried to explain to her that it just was not edible and asked her if we could change it for something else. After a lot of going back and forth, she finally offered to bring my husband another piece. We didn't see how that would help since this \"new\" piece would probably be from the same old batch but at this point we were so tired of arguing with her that we just agreed. Of course, the second piece tasted just as horrible as the first so my husband just left it there. What we don't understand is if you are going to give us a new piece anyway, why not give us something else that we would actually enjoy? It was as if she was purposely trying to get rid of this old batch of brownies. The worst is after all this, she retrieved back to her little office a few feet away from us to do her paperwork and never even bothered coming back to check up on us and see if this second piece was an improvement from the last one. Customer service was a big zero."}
{"text":"The prices are crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The hot chocolates are very small portions, but the savory crepes are pretty good. The goat cheese in the crepe is pretty bad. The waitress however was amazing. She was very sweet."}
{"text":"Went to Montreal with three friends for the long weekend and stumbled upon this place. We ended up loving it so much that we came here twice on our 4 day trip. I would highly recommend this place to anyone; they have sweet items as well as savoury.

I got two dessert jars the first time I was here and was left wanting more by the time I finished them. The second time, I got the broccoli soup and was pleasantly surprised. It came out warm with a crepe based garnish on top that was delicious. The service was lovely as well and offered suggestions to me and my friends as they knew we had not been before."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but the service was terrible. It took forever for them to take our order and then it was an ordeal to just get her back to pay. She was oblivious to her surroundings and if she took a second to check out her surroundings it would have made a world of difference for everyone (the couple next to us had the same issue), 

In terms of food, I was sold on the lava cake when I saw Yelpers' photos but it didn't wow me. Don't get me wrong - it was good but nothing special. My wife's caramel brownie, on the other hand, was super. I wish I would have gone with another option."}
{"text":"not sure if this is the same location i went to, but juliette et chocolat in mile end was divine.

i had the salty caramel crepe with fleur de sel and a chocolate banana smoothie - both were incredible.  pricing a little high, but all to be expected for designer chocolate, and their food looked so pretty it may as well have been fake.  would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  It took forever for someone to take our order, and then our order --coffee, hot chocolate and two desserts -- never came.  We asked about it, and were told she would check.  Still no order and no response.  We waited another ten minutes and left and went across the street to Starbucks."}
{"text":"If you are looking for decadence, Juliette's is your place.  Don't think about calories as you'll not be able to try any of their delectable treats.  Think about decadence and you are off and running.
We had a mix of offerings and they were all fantastic.  From the made-t-order dipped homemade ice cream bar (caramel sea salt ice cream dipped in dark chocolate with orange rind chucks) or the lava cake that oozes goodness.  The lava cake has a side of ice cream with hot salted caramel sauce.  It was all soooo good!
For an added bonus the cappuccino was huge, the milk light and frothy.  Soooo good."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here while wandering around Montreal. We got hot chocolates to share; one dark and one milk. Thick, full of flavor, and not overly sweet; these hot chocolates really hit the spot on a cold day! They were very rich and thick, so I highly recommend sharing because they are hard to finish on their own. I personally enjoyed the dark more than the milk. They also make an extra dark hot chocolate. They serve desserts as well, which looked amazing. We will have to come back for those!!"}
{"text":"Various treats to soothe your sweet tooth! Absolutely delicious, luscious, rich, and tasteful. 

I love their crepes, chocolate shots, raspberry sorbet with meringue, and brownies. Seriously, EVERYTHING is great. The St. Laurent Juliette et Chocolat is situated amidst numerous bars, clubs and other restaurants, which makes it a great spot to start the night or end the night - your pick! It gets busy and somewhat loud, but the ambiance and service never fail!"}
{"text":"Un peu cher, difficile à trouver au Dix30. Mais les desserts, les crêpes, le chocolat valent la peine. En hiver, un chocolat chaud est l'idéal"}
{"text":"We had the fruit and fondue for one which was the perfect amount for two people. We also split the grandma's cocoa which is like no other hot chocolate I have ever had. The chocolate was good as well as the drink and this place is definitely a must-visit. If anything else, it's rare to find such a large restaurant that centers on chocolate. Definitely worth the experience."}
{"text":"Nice food. Poor service. Also seemed quite disorganized as to who was seeing which table."}
{"text":"Juliette et Chocolat est un établissement qui nous a été recommandé par une amie qui vit à Montréal. La spécialité de la maison ce sont les brownies alors tout de suite ça donne envie d'y aller faire un tour.

L'établissement est grand, beau, propre, agréable, bref... tout plein de superlatifs pourraient s'y appliquer d'autant que le matin où nous y sommes allés, le soleil était radieux, les vitres grandes ouvertes... ahhh ça sentait bon les vacances et le bien être canadien !

La carte était toute aussi agréable à lire bien que le dilemme était important; j'avais presque envie de parler de \"trilemme\" ou \"quadrilemme\" même !

Je me suis orienté vers le Banatella alliant de la banane et du Nutella.... Hmmm un terrible délice que le capuccino et sa crème accompagnait à merveille. Le brownie n'est pas très très gros, tout du moins il était plus petit que ma gourmandise mais c'est pas plus mal d'être raisonable.

Un super spot à brownie à conserver dans vos smartphones !"}
{"text":"Last time I visited Montreal, I only got to try their savoury crepe so I came back and got one of the most choclate-y things on their menu: their hot chocolate. Or more like, pure melted chocolate.

I ordered the Maralumi 64% while my friend got the Ghana 40%. The Maralumi was less sweet and had a more earthy flavour compared to the Ghana. Both delicious. If you want to sit down from all the shopping on St. Laurent, this is a cute place to do so!

I won't lie, the Christmas decorations drew me in, naturally."}
{"text":"I stumbled across Juliette & Chocolat without Yelp-ing it first and I don't regret it at all!

I was starving so I ordered a savoury crepe with grilled pineapples, ham, and mozarella cheese and everything tasted so fresh and appetizing. The combination was fantastic and I thought that it was a great entree for summer. I didn't get to order their chocolates but I can say with confidence that their savoury crepes aren't bad at all :)"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Will go again. 
Chocolate overdose. That's the way I want to go"}
{"text":"Personnellement, je ne m'y arrête jamais pour manger sur place. L'endroit y est trop bruyantt, le service trop mauvais et je n'ai tout simplement pas envie de perdre l'illusion que j'ai de l'endroit qui est celle-ci: Les brownies sont à pleurer!!!
Grand amateur de sucré-salé, le brownie au caramel la fleur de sel est excellent. Les autres classique aussi, mais j'ai définitivement un faible pour le sus-mentionné."}
{"text":"As someone who is coming from out of town and with only a passable French, this place was absolutely accommodating , friendly and stylish. Located in an excellent spot for people-watching (inside or outside seating), just a coffee or hot chocolate stop is worht the visit.  But you would be insane NOT to try one of the chocolate (from white to dark) or desert crepes. You really can't lose here. 1 recommendation; split each crepe between 2 people."}
{"text":"I get the caramel brownie trifle whenever i go and boy is it just heavenly. 

I honestly don't have a single friend that's been to Juliette and chocolat that doesn't love this place. 

One of my friends is a celiac and lactose intolerant and even she has a dessert she loves from there.

The only downside is that I wished the service was better, I've been to all locations and i think they don't train their employees very well because the service is always pretty bad."}
{"text":"For years, the only thing I would eat was their fondant au chocolat because it was so good (it's still good btw). I remember trying almost everything on their menu until... today. I tried for the first time their rocher cake. Oh my, it was divine. Think chocolate mousse, praline, hazelnut taste + crispy chunks. DIVINE! Next time, I'll add an ice cream next to the cake and I'll have my new fondant au chocolat to enjoy. Juliette et Chocolat is the place to go when a coma by chocolate is needed the most. They offer various types of chocolate, milk, dark, etc. Their desserts are more rich than sweet. Satisfaction is guaranteed if you are a chocolate lover. This location is better too than the St-Denis one, there's less waiting time and no or almost no lineups to get in. Other interesting info: 
Fondant au chocolat: most of the time the center isn't melting (upsets me each time).
Wine: you need to order a meal (read: dinner/lunch - not dessert) to be able to order their wine, which is very disappointed providing their low price on wine. Plus, I'm not even talking about how chocolate would taste ridiculously delicious with wine."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes to be served. Had to snap fingers to be noticed. Chocolate is decent, but not worth the 1000 Calories."}
{"text":"Hot chocolate (Grandma's Style) is too thick, waitress should warn customers. The 70% is too bitter, again customers should be told this. The Classic Waffle is hard, dry and cold. The Complete Crepe (savory) is too empty and the crepe is dry. Service was slow."}
{"text":"this is what i had expected and was actually forewarned-- expensive and
too expensive, but delicious nonetheless. coming from nyc and chicago, i know what lure chocolate has for any establishment that does it well.  you get flavorful and yes, i will use the word \"rich\" once more with everyone else who already reviewed. hot chocolate---the taste and the texture are specifically complex, delicious, and of quality. if your pocket can stretch the way mine cannot so much of the time, it's good to try at least once. do not count on stellar service as in my case(s) it was spotty and inattentive."}
{"text":"If you know any children, bring them here. They will love you forever. 

If you dont know any children, bring your adult friends...especially girls.. 
Everyone likes chocolate."}
{"text":"This place is packed. Really cute, pretty average prices, except for the drinks because they are made of pure chocolate, so they are a bit pricey and my gosh are they decadent! Dang! 
Really cute for kids too becuase it's a place that specializes in chocolate...but also they have great crepes and chocolate liquer drinks. 
It's one of those, well known and well-loved restaurants of Montreal. Worth going to at least once."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting, but I guess I got it? It reminded me a lot of Max Brenner. 

I ordered the chocolate lava cake with milk chocolate sauce. I'm 99% sure I didn't eat it the right way (I think you're supposed to put the ice cream on top of the cake and then pour the sauce over it) but it was still tasty!

It was a pretty noisy environment, didn't make for a romantic atmosphere as the name suggests. Price-wise was kind of pricey but not too ridiculous. 

The dessert was sweet (duh) but nothing too special. I wouldn't come here again but it was still nice."}
{"text":"Delicioussssssssss,Awesomeeeeeeeeeeee,Crazyyyyyyyyyyy,Love itttttttttttttttttttttt. It's Not enough"}
{"text":"I totally love this place!
I love the red cook hats they're wearing.
I love that they have two patios - front and back
I love the location
and of course I just love everything on their menu!

their alcohol chocolate drinks are very interesting. I only tried Nutcracker and Chocolate Mojito but both very yummy.
Smoothies are think and chocolaty rich. 
brownies are yummy and always served warm.
crepes are yummy too!

I always go here when I'm in montreal!"}
{"text":"I went here for a chocolate fix and I was a little disappointed.  The decor was charming but it lacked in character like the store in St. Denis.  

I had the fleur de sel medley and it felt a bit off.  Less orgasmic than what I remember.  The saltiness of the caramel sauce did not jump at me.  The servers were nicely suited with cute red themed costumes but they were slow on the uptake.  This location seems to lack the vibrancy and flavour of the other store. But it is definitely better than no Juliet et Chocolat at all."}
{"text":"Bring your sweet tooth.  The place to go for dessert and coffee after dinner. Amazing and delicious choices for the chocolate and sweets lover in you.  Great milkshakes, crepes, pastries, chocolate and lunch (salads and lunch crepes). Yumm!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place.  It is decadent and delicious and open late!  I had the fleur de sel brownie with caramel sauce.  Out of this world!  I could have drank that whole sauce pot and have been content.  It was luscious, smooth and velvety.  Amazing!

They even have really naughty chocolate displays so you could bring the experience home and get a giggle from the recipient.

Service was ok but who cares when the food is sinfully divine.  Definitely a must go when you are in Montreal.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super variety of chocolate but watch out for long-waiting times. It's best to avoid the rush hour if you're in a big group.


 Great crepes, humongous ice cream portions and has a delicious raspberry 'n dark chocolate dessert. A must-go place while in Montreal!!!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for some chocolate and sweet, this is the place. Great vibe and wonderful selection of desserts. Everything looks good on the menu. Definitely must try the hot chocolate and the tiramisu."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum, yum yum!!!!  This place came extremely well recommended.  While I love chocolate it isn't quite worth the hype.... but still DELICIOUS.

My boyfriend and I went on the coldest day on record,,, something like -17 F.  We had to stop in to a bunch of hokey stores all the way down in order to keep from freezing to death.  Once we finally made it, it was warm and inviting.

We each had hot chocolate - great, but almost too thick to drink.  We then split a dark chocolate fondue... fruits were ripe and sweet.  Chocolate was thick and dark."}
{"text":"This wonderful little place is very close to the Berri-UQAM metro stop, and yet my mom and I managed to get completely lost and walk for at least 20 minutes in the wrong direction. No matter; it was completely worth the extra effort once we finally made it inside and saw the menu.  I don't think I even knew there were so many kinds of chocolate - talk about overwhelming (in a very, very good way).  

Though it was summer, I could resist ordering grandma-style hot chocolate in a variety that had a slight hazelnut flavor.  I was surprised that not only was is not overbearingly sweet, it was hardly sweet at all.  Again, this was a good thing - although it was also very rich so I had to drink slowly. My mom had a banana-chocolate milkshake, and it was probably the most chocolatey, rich, delicious shake I will ever taste in my life.  I would highly recommend it as a cold alternative to the delicious hot chocolates.

Mom ordered a maple syrup crepe and I had the salted caramel crepe with fleur de sel.  Hers was good, but mine was one of the best crepes I've ever tasted in my entire life.  The flavor of the salted caramel was intense but very balanced - so it didn't feel too thick, or too overwhelming.  Just absolutely delicious.

This was well worth our inadvertent detour and not too expensive for the quality of the food (and especially the quality of the chocolate)!"}
{"text":"Brownies, Chocolate, Ice Cream, and Hot Chocolate.  Wow, the chocolate options here are good.

I had the caramel hot chocolate, which came out served in a brandy snifter! (See photo)  Also I had a brownie with hazelnuts, topped with hazelnut ice cream and literally steaming hot chocolate topping.

Service is slow, but if you're not in a hurry and looking to enjoy a leisurely dessert, definitely give this place a try.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is a chocolate lovers nightmare. There is so much chocolate you'll order it all. No really. Anyways, I highly recommend this place if you love all things chocolate."}
{"text":"I did the take out option. The ladies, Maelle were amazing. She was so nice to us and patiently explained all the items available and how we could buy them. Would definitely go back, the staff is very professional!"}
{"text":"C'est très bon on ne peut pas le nier. 
Je me suis laissé tenter par un shooter au chocolat blanc. Je n'appellerai pas ca un shooter Parce que beaucoup plus gros. Si vous avez une grosse envie de ganache a la petite cuillère alors vous serait servi   Personnellement je m'attendais à quelque chose de plus petit. Du coup obliger de le mélanger au brownie pour pouvoir le manger en entier. 
Le brownie, j'ai choisis la version avec morceaux de gâteau au chocolat blanc et caramel a la fleur de sel. 
Le caramel beaucoup trop salé à mon goût. Et soyons honnête le goût du gâteau au chocolat blanc est inexistant. Alors oui c'était bon mais j'admets être un peu déçu par rapport à tout ce qu'on  m'avait raconté. Rien n'empêche que je souhaite tout de même revenir et testé leurs crêpes au sarrasin. 
Envie de chocolat vous serez servis !"}
{"text":"Incredibly decadent, sumptuous chocolate desserts. I was actually really impressed because I was kind of expecting a tourist trap. I enjoyed it, especially the classic nut brownie."}
{"text":"Saw this cool little place at the corner of my eye. Decided to try it out! Super delicious, they have different types of chocolate you can taste around the world. hey are pretty pricey, but it's worth it. Their banana split is loaded with melted chocolate at the bottom.

Love the atmosphere, can see this to be a really neat date night. 

I'm not sure if i would come back here - because it's really pricey and the portions aren't all that big. 

But overall, the dessert is good and would love to come here"}
{"text":"We got chocolate fondue, which was quite good. Good variety of fruits for dipping, and the chocolate was tasty. We also got milkshakes, which were alright (kind of on the watery side). The menu looked pretty extensive (and expensive!), and includes many different items. (The crepes the folks around us got looked really good.)

Unfortunately, the service really ruins the place.  We had to wait in line for a table (on a tuesday night).  The hostess was not particularly polite either. Once we sat down, we had to wait ages for the server to come by. They brought out our fondue first, and we asked about the milkshakes, and the girl who brought the food was extremely rude.  When we finally had everything, we also had to wait ages for our check.

I understand that the place was quite busy, but I at least expect the staff to avoid being outright rude to the customers."}
{"text":"My bf and I stopped here for a late night dessert and to meet up with some of my friends who were travelling to Montreal the same weekend. We arrived here around 9pm and it was still bustling. Thank goodness for outside seating cause the chocolate melters and other machinery behind the counter were heating up the shop to near suffocating degrees (And they had no AC on the night we stopped by! Poor staff). Being a huge fan of brownies and all things rich, chocolatey, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, my bf ordered the banana brownie, which turned out super rich and super fudgy. He loved it though it took quite a while for him to work through that slice of brownie. I, on the other hand, opted for a much lighter tiramisu, which charmingly came in a jar with a lid on the side. How cute! But the tiramisu wasn't just looks. It tasted heavenly! Not the best tiramisu I've ever had but it's up there on the list of good tiramisus. This tiramisu was more cream and mousse than cake. I'm used to a more balanced approach but this was good too. It was more like eating tiramisu mousse cake. You could taste a bit of the rum but not much; The coffee flavor overpowered most of the other flavors, though everything was eventually muted by the excessive cream and mousse. I prefer my tiramisu cakes to be complex in flavor, just the right mix of coffee and rum, and the right amount of cream/mousse to bring it all together, not overwhelm the other flavors. Still this wasn't a big deal. The cake still tasted delicious! Only thing that truly bothered me was how much excess powder they sprinkled on top of the cake. My first bite was like breathing in a sand dune, and I proceeded to gag and cough and choke for the next 5 min. After which, I decided to scrape off all of the powder.

But yes, overall, it's not a bad place to grab a quick sweet bite. It's just not the best desserts place I've been to.

Food: 3/5 -- good but not good enough to be exceptional
Service: 3/5 -- friendly, attentive, welcoming
Atmosphere: 2.5/5 -- nice open, outdoors patio area but no AC and sweltering indoors; also tables were fairly dirty... spills and crumbs everywhere

Overall: 3/5 -- good"}
{"text":"Brownies galore! If you love chocolate - you'll be in heaven. If you don't love chocolate, you'll learn to!
My group had brownies ($4.50-5 each, big): Balsamico, Caramel Salé, Orange+Amande. Also gianduja+lime mousse, hazenut mousse, (I think $5-6 each) and a spicy hot chocolate
all was amazing, I couldn`t even pick  favourite!"}
{"text":"Loooove their white chocolate coconut brownie!

Service could have been better, it was a little slow."}
{"text":"The service was great maybe a little too much chocolat for me but it wouldn't be a place where i'd go back"}
{"text":"We waited for seats for twenty minutes at which point they started shutting down tables. We asked what was going on and were given a song and a dance about how that section was being shut down. Eventually they told us that the bathroom was broken and they were closing but that we were welcome to take our expensive hot chocolate to go. 

Waiting for a purpose is fine, waiting for no reason is not. I usually don't give two stars without multiple trips, but this was a little too absurd to not comment. Based on others reviews, it sounds like management has a huge customer service issue to address with their staff."}
{"text":"J'adore Juliette et Chocolat, notamment pour ses boissons chaudes l'hiver, et aussi pour ses galettes et crêpes vraiment super bonnes!! Et l'odeur quand on y rentre est super agréable!
Par contre, dans ce Juliette-ci, l'hiver, je trouve qu'il y fait toujours trop chaud, ce n'est pas agréable!! De plus, le service n'y est pas terrible, on peut attendre un bon moment avant de se faire prendre la commande ou se faire servir..
Les fins de semaine, c'est souvent plein
Je le recommande toutefois car c'est un classique de Montréal, et les produits sont de qualité
On peut aussi prendre des gâteaux à emporter, et il y a depuis quelques mois une gamme de produits dérivés du magasin à vendre
Bon à savoir, il y a un truc pour changer les bébés dans les toilettes; il y a aussi des options sans gluten"}
{"text":"The hot chocolates are good and the location is great, but it is most of the time really packet. It took quite a long time for our order to arrive, I would advice against going there to eat if you are in a hurry. The service was great! The lady who served me was smiling from ear to ear and seemed to enjoy her job"}
{"text":"While the deserts were certainly tasty, I found the venue to be uninviting and loud, with out-of-control pricing on the dessert items. I recommend you try the sampler options providing a few bites of some of their most popular options, which also comes in at a fairly good value as well."}
{"text":"Je trouve que le \"Juliette et chocolat\" du quartier dix 30 est le mieux et le plus propre par rapport aux 3 de montréal. De plus, il est plus facile de se stationner et c'est gratuit :)
Pour la nourriture, j'ai pris un diabolo framboise comme boisson (correct sans plus), une crêpe savoyarde (on ne sentait pas beaucoup le fromage à raclette et les pommes de terre sont fades) par contre la pâte à crêpe à la farine de sarrasin était bonne, et en dessert un \"trifle\" (morceaux de brownies avec une sauce au chocolat noir) c'était bon :)
Leur meilleur dessert pour le moment que j'ai goûté et à conseiller : Medley fleur de sel"}
{"text":"This was recommended by a friend and Juliette et chocolat did not disappoint. I ordered the classic hot chocolate (33% chocolate) and the banana waffle and i was in sugar heaven. I have a natural sweet tooth and so most of the menu was catered to me. I walked out with 2000 calories of chocolate in my belly, a veritable walking cavity with a smile on my face. However, my girlfriend is a fan of savory food and had the complete a buckwheat crepe with gruyère ham and egg; her only complaint was it was dry and tasteless around the edges. We went for brunch just after they opened on a Saturday and the place was busy but our orders came pretty quickly. We also ordered a blondie (l'ivoire) to go which was heavenly. The place is charming and bigger on the inside than it seems. Also the kitchen area is wide open so you can watch them prepare your crepes."}
{"text":"Excellent dessert place. Not cheap, but very good. Even our non chocolate eater enjoyed a crepe with maple syrup and bananas. I had the ice cream sundae. Fantastic, wish we could come back and try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Before moving to Montreal I would always make a point to visit Juliette et Chocolat on St. Denis when I was in town. And with good reason. The chocolate is ohmygod so good. No, seriously. 

So, last night while strolling down St. Laurent on my way to a Nuit Blanche exhibit, I was very happy to see the new (and quite big, I must say) location of Juliette et Chocolat and easily convinced my friends to escape the crowds and enjoy some chocolate. It wasn't a hard sell, quite honestly. I had the fondant au caramel salée and it was nothing short of heavenly. We definitely had no regrets foregoing the Nuit Blanche activities.

The crepes and fondue are also amazing, but the fruit smoothies aren't anything exciting. Then again, why order a fruit smoothie when the focus is clearly chocolate?"}
{"text":"I wish I could have tasted the entire menu!  Warning: this is for true chocolate lovers.
The hot chocolate was too chocolaty for my Swiss miss loving son.  I had to drink some and have them put milk in.  It was unbelievably chocolaty!
We went back in the morning for crepes.  I had sugar butter which was buttery and mildly sweet.  Delicious. Hubby had savory buckwheat crepe with eggs and ham- very nice.  Waitress was bubbly and super friendly and seemed thrilled to work there.  She even came by with a sample of an ice cream sandwich- again, Very chocolaty. If you love chocolate or tender crepes, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews I went to Juliette Et Chocolat expecting a Cafe Rude / Soup Nazi experience and therefore I was both disappointed and pleased to be greated by a friendly and helpful staff at Juliette Et Chocolat. I am a hot chocolate nut, who rewards himself with two cups of hot cocoa each night of the year as a reward for staying within my dietary guideliines during the day. During any year I will go through 30 canisters of cocoa powder with my favorites being Allegro, Lake Champlain and Dagoga Xocotatl. I had the Chocolat Epice at Juliette and without question, it is the best I have ever had. The Intense Chcolate  Brownie for dessert was warm and everything I hoped it would be. I felt the portion of the Chcolat Epice was generous for $5.95. I will be back in Montreal in November and I guarantee that I will make it back to Juliette Et Chocolat."}
{"text":"The fleur de sel brownie was delicious, but VERY SWEET! So much that the next day, when we went to Juliette again (lol), I had the lemon petit pot - delicious. My hubby had the molten lava cake with chocolate and he loved it. Service was okay - the waiter was very serious and didn't really fit the cute cafe vibe."}
{"text":"Where do frazzled couples go for late evening dessert? And single girls who don't want another sweaty, dirty night of clubbing on St. Laurent?

Ah, yes, Juliette et chocolate!

You'll find yourself standing in line, and probably shouting over the table to your friend; it's that busy. I ordered the cheesecake brownie and a mousse pot. However, after finishing the brownie, I realized...there was no 'cheese' taste to the cheesecake brownie!! I told the waiter and he thought I had ordered the caramel brownie. He did not offer to bring me my actual order, or take the caramel brownie off the bill. I was NOT pleased. Although the mousse was pretty good, the brownie-mix up was a real downer.

Maybe it wouldn't have bothered me so much if I wasn't paying for overpriced dessert in a place lacking ambience, as well as tasteful service."}
{"text":"On a passé une commande pour emporter. La file s'allongeait alors on a avancé vers la caisse pour laisser la place à des clients qui choisissaient leur commande. 

Pendant qu'on attendait notre commande devant ce qui semblait être la caisse réservée au comptoir pour emporter une serveuse \"Amélie\" de la section des tables est venue m'engueuler sans ménagement  (oui, oui, engueuler!) moi et mon père car il semblerait que sans le savoir on était rendu dans un espace strictement réservé aux serveurs et qu'on y était persona non grata. Pourtant rien n'indiquait que l'on était dans une telle zone. 

\"Amélie\" était aussi contrariée qu'on ne prenne pas une table avec elle et qu'on choisisse plutôt de commander au comptoir avec une serveuse déjà affairée à nous préparer notre commande et bien plus sympathique. 

Cependant suite à cette intervention inopportune d'Amélie notre serveuse au comptoir est devenue vraiment toute stressée et anxieuse.

On a mangé nos deux brownies et deux chocolats chauds pour un total de 25 $ et presque autant de minutes debout au comptoir à attendre notre commande. 

Le chocolat chaud était tiède."}
{"text":"The brownies and the crepes are so good. Plus it's open till pretty late so it's nice for a late night snack. Good prices and good service."}
{"text":"J'aime bien mon Juliette et chocolat. Le service et la nourriture s'équivaut pas mal d'une franchise à une autre, ce qui est une bonne chose. 

Nous avons été plutôt mal installé (assez près des cuisines pour avoir trop chaud en hiver), mais bon nous étions un groupe et c'était achalandé."}
{"text":"Comme j'ai déjà dit, j'aime bien mon Juliette et chocolat. Particulièrement cette succursale puisque l'arrangement des tables nous donne de la place pour circuler (même avec une pousette) et que ça localisation au coin de 2 rues donne beaucoup de lumière et un effet terrasse.

Toujours aussi bon et aussi sucré, mais bon, on ne va pas là pour soigner sa ligne."}
{"text":"Ce n'est pas mon Juliette et Chocolat préféré, il est bizarrement fait, trop plein, et le service n'est pas toujours top. Mais comme il est proche de ma job, j'y retourne à l'occasion.
Par contre, lors de ma dernière visite, j'ai trouvé ma crêpe de sarrasin particulièrement petite et mon conjoint a eu droit à une assiette de pesto accompagné de galette de sarrasin. Bref, j'ai été déçue."}
{"text":"Great Chocolate, great fondue. Fantastic experience there. I had so much fun. Thank you."}
{"text":"We love Juliette & chocolat! We tried a couple of their locations multiple times and this one is particularly nice in the summer because they have a terrace. The food is always good. We prefer it over Cacao 70. By a lot. The service, however, varies from visit to visit, and yesterday night is was really hard to get hold of our server when we were sitting inside and she was serving and getting orders outside (I guess there's a down side to the terrace... especially if you can't get a seat there). They really need more servers to cover such a large ground."}
{"text":"We went on a Metro adventure to find this place.....

Good thing was we walked through Square Saint-Louis on the way....serendipity at work.

We came in and were quickly seated and served.

The great...hubby ordered a chocolate drink with 80% cocoa...and it was amazing!!

The not so great...I ordered a cheesecake brownie....and was very underwhelmed by the cheesecake. The brownie layer was good.

Buddies ordered a Fleur De Sel Caramel Brownie and Ice cream item they loved.

Word to the wise....stick with the chocolate."}
{"text":"We passed by this establishment enroute to the nearby \"must eat at\" deli. I should have skipped the deli and gone straight here. The desserts were divine. The hot chocolate is something I can hardly wait to have again. We ate our meal and wound up buying stuff to go. Some was for ourselves and some as gifts for our friends in the US.

I was concerned about prior comments on it being busy. We had a nary a problem getting a seat on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Amazing dessert bar/restaurant!! So many options it was so hard to choose! I can't believe anyone would give this place less than 5 stars, the desserts are incredible!

We had a heavy dinner so we wanted to share a smaller dessert. But I wish we saved room because their sundaes and fondue looked amazing. They have small deserts in a jar so we went with the black forest cake jar. 

The jar was plenty for both of us to share first because we were pretty full but also because the cream was very rich and flavorful. There was vanilla cream and chocolate cream with a layer of cherry jelly in the middle and chocolate shavings on top. So good!! 

They also had delicious looking crepes so we will definitely try that next time! 

Heads up, get ready to spend a little more on dessert when you come here. For the quality of food you get it is totally worth it, though!"}
{"text":"There's few things better than sitting on a terasse in warm weather, with good company, and enjoying a sweet or savory snack. I had the dark chocolate crepe made with semi-sweet chocolate. It was generous in the amount of chocolate, I just found the crepe to be a little too thin in certain areas. Also, the service was a bit slow...it seemed to be not the busiest time of day but there were a number of other patrons at the time. Was it good? Absolutely, and it's a nice change of pace compared to my usual spots. I'll definitely be back again to try something else."}
{"text":"The place is commodious and service is friendly. The grilled banana & caramel crêpe with chai lemonade both tasted fantastic ! Chocolate ice cream was really rich but brownie cookies were too sweet for me."}
{"text":"I had some brownies there and it's a must do for chocolate lovers! The atmosphere was cozy and the staff really friendly! A little but overpriced, though."}
{"text":"After indulging my favourite smoked meat at Schwartz's, I walked by this dessert place and got attracted by its bright, open, pretty (and girly) decor. It was a cool and quiet Sunday afternoon, and we were seated on the side while all the windows/doors were opened. Nice fresh air and people watching!

We ordered few items to satisfy our sweet tooth craving:
- Classic style dark semi-sweet hot chocolate ($4.99)
- The Velvety Chill ~ chilled milk chocolate, Baileys, scoop of hazelnut ice cream, and a dash of fleur de sel caramel ($10.50)
- regular coffee
- Gianduja and lime mousse cake ($5.99)

We loved the iced chocolate Baileys drink the most.  It's very smooth and not overly sweet.  Seriously, Baileys makes everything taste so much better!!! LOL

Hot chocolate was presented in a weird bowl and milk jug.  Initially we didn't know what to do with the bowl.  It tasted pretty good.

Coffee was A-okay, nothing to write about.

Mousse cake was meh. I have had much better cake elsewhere. The cake bottom could be more interesting if it was made crunchier.

Service was pretty good. Many Yelpers have complained that the service was cold. I guess we were lucky on that day. It wasn't exceptionally warm, but it was attentive enough. Just a bit slow, but that's what I found in many Montreal eateries. Is it because Montreal people are more laid back? :P

They do have some cute chocolate items for sale in their fridge. Heard of Chocolate Lipsticks before? :D They looked very real indeed!

This place is definitely on the expensive side. Would I be back? May be. I wouldn't mind coming back for a girls day/night out or a date, but not for a quick chocolate fix on my own.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I love coming here (and the other location on Laurier is just as good)! the food is always amazing! rain or shine - chocolate would make you feel better! If I'm hungry I like getting some savory dish to start and then move on to dessert. Sometimes soup. Other times, a buckwheat crepe filled with goodness. My favourite dessert is the balsamico brownie, but it's a really tough call, since I love so many of the things on the menu! Treat yourself to some goodness..."}
{"text":"Unbelievably slow, rude, and unprofessional service.

Tasty hot chocolate.  Somewhat expensive.  Good location."}
{"text":"My first time here was with my cousins.  We came in here to have some sweets to satisfy our palates.
 I have to say I enjoyed the atmosphere, it was warm and welcoming. The customer service was good; very accommodating.  The pastries were subtly sweet (which I love) and obviously not overwhelmingly sweet like most American desserts. Overall, I can't complain."}
{"text":"If you are PMS-ing and need some chocolate and dessert, come here to join the other chocolate craving girls. There are lots of females in this restaurant. 

The crepes are not that amazing, really. The food here in general is so-so to good. It is not like 'O M G' amazing kind of thing. 

Like I would rather spend my calories somewhere else unless I really need my fix right away and it happens to be right in front of me as I'm walking down the street."}
{"text":"Best Hot chocolate I have had. Home made marshmallows is cool touch. Loved the atmosphere. Would recommend to any one who is looking for a dessert and coffee. Chocolate lovers dream!"}
{"text":"This location is not a nice as the Saint Denis location, but the food is pretty much the same. Chocolate Chocolate and more Chocolate, if you go you must try the chocolate port, port and chocolate go so well together."}
{"text":"Since there are so many reviews I will just add my 2 cents.

I LOVE the chocolate Port, alcohol and chocolate were meant to be together!"}
{"text":"Really great options. Heaven for chocolate lovers but be careful to not to overstuff yourself! Chocolate fondue for one is big enough to feed two people. Must try it out when in the city."}
{"text":"I like the ice cream here...taste so good...this place is always busy..the service is ok..but the price is a bite expensive..."}
{"text":"Two of our friends ordered combos with coffees and desserts, the waiter only brought main courses and never ask until hours later when we check that he told us he forgot the other things, even the supervisor seemed to agree with the waiter that they thought it's our responsibility to ask for the coffee and dessert! What a ridiculous service!"}
{"text":"Chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate. Especially when served in a high ball snifter makes one want to indulge even more. Excellent chocolate selection and crepes, but what turned me off was the poor service. I really don't like to wait 30 minutes after I've finished to pay my bill."}
{"text":"After dinner on the Main, we figured we should try some desserts here. People waited in line even in the rain to get in. Fortunately, we didn't have to wait more than a few minutes to be seated.

My wife enjoyed her café au lait and I opted for the Pot au Chocolat. Very rich and delicious - I recommend.

The place can be quite busy, but the waitstaff is friendly and accommodating. Our waitress patiently waited for these two Americans to bumble through our order in French, even complimenting our efforts and encouraging us to continue practicing. Awww... merci beaucoup.

Definitely drop in here if you're on the Main!"}
{"text":"I had one of the Ecuadorian drinking chocolates, Arriba. I lived in Ecuador several years ago, so I'm partial to all things Ecuadorian, and my loyalty was rewarded. A perfectly balanced chocolate, just sweet enough, with a thick, smooth texture. My friend got one of the darker ones and enjoyed it as well. I can't remember if mine was Grandma's Style or Classic Style.

My friend and I shared the namesake salad that included pears, goat cheese, and strawberries. I loved it; she thought it was just okay.

I then had an Intense Brownie and LOVED it. Very rich. I also took home a few chocolates and enjoyed them a week later (I shipped them from Vermont to my home in Indiana so they wouldn't be damaged on my flight.) I got the Speculoos, the rum Coke, and another - the lemon tea, I believe. They were all delightful.

The server was very pleasant and helpful, and the atmosphere was so cozy! I'll definitely return the next time I'm in Quebec."}
{"text":"Service was quite lacking.
I had a savory salad with buckwheat crepe and it was uninspired.  Portion was substantial.  Lemonade wasn't very good.

I'd return to try something sweet but I'd never recommend this place for a meal."}
{"text":"I, like any other girl can only say yes to chocolate and other sweets. I would have given a five star if it weren't for the inattentive service. I understand the place is busy but you sooner you meet all my needs, the sooner i'll leave."}
{"text":"As we strolled down the street, the sweet, fragrant, chocolatey air caught our attention and when we lift up our heads, we noticed the the chocolate dessert shop Juliette and chocolat. Without a second thought, my friend and I walked in to check it out, but unfortunately, the lady told us they were closing soon. We still looked at the selection of chocolates they had on display and glanced at the menu. The next day we came back for desserts after dinner and shared the three-chocolates chocolate fondue with fruits. The sweet chocolates were smooth and creamy and complemented very well with the fresh tart fruits. 

Surprisingly, there can be quite a line in the evening hours and we had to wait about 10-20 min to get a seat inside. It's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Brookie.  It's a brownie with a cookie in it.   Yes, this place is really good at dessert.

However, I also ordered a crepe because I came in for breakfast, and it takes about a half an hour to get it.  I kept wondering what all the empty chairs had ordered, or if the crepe-cooker had to be called in from home when I ordered."}
{"text":"The best crepes. We were skeptical because the crepe is made from buckwheat but turned out to be delicious. Adding chocolate drinks, turned this lunch into a spectacular event. I had the classique hot chocolate with mushroom crepe. GF had the provenciale crepe with a large chocolate drink. We ordered 2 brownies but had to take them with us as we were a little full."}
{"text":"Likes: chocolate, location, concept, service
Dislikes: price

Went here in late August 2013 on a late Saturday night. The place was packed, and the line-ups took 20 minutes to get in. 

Location:
The location is prime. It's in a busy spot in Montreal where a lot of young people hung out. Night life was everywhere. This is perfect for date night. 

Chocolate: 
A place that specializes on chocolates?! Hell yes! I love the concept, how it really is a prime spot for dessert. Chocolate lovers will be served with all options for chocolate. They even had alcoholic drinks with chocolate, shooters, chocolate from around the world.

Service:
Service was totally there. The servers were friendly and energetic. They also spoke English, so a plus if French isn't your strength. 

Verdict:
Oui! Worth the wait. I wish they have this in Vancouver :)"}
{"text":"Took the family here before we headed to the airport to pick up some chocolate for our friends had a quick dessert. Wow it was amazing. The fleur de sel carmel was out of this world. No chocolate for our friends \"Let them eat Carmel!\""}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a long time, yet the other day I came in and it took us 45 minutes to even receive drinks (a diet coke and apple juice). Then another hour and a half before we got our food. I understood it was busy so we didn't say anything to our waiter (especially because it is not his fault), but when we eventually paid, my waiter crumpled up my receipt and threw it on my plate, exclaiming \"now you can f*** off\". This is never okay from service staff and I definitely will not be coming back here after."}
{"text":"They didnt have strawberries, didnt offer any better option or an upgrade, on top of that we didnt speak french and the waiter didnt have any patience towards us..not willing to wait for us to decide which plate.
In addition he had the courage to ask for tip like if its mandatory...seriously ?"}
{"text":"Of the three times I've visited this place, the service has always been bad, good thing their hot chocolates are worth the pain.

If you like dark chocolate, then order from their Dark Vintage selection of hot chocolates. I ordered the Guanaja, the Araguani, and the Tanzania. \"Grandma's Style\" is the best, uber chocolately.

They're served with a small piece of chocolate too, treat after treat. (The least they can do to make up for the poor service.) 

If you like Milkshakes, and are hungry, these will fill you right up with creamy goodness. Its not like Fat Burger's milkshakes, but a bit more chocolatelyish, its a rich shake.


As far as their crepes, they're okay, not so flavorful, kinda flimsy, that pesto goat cheese with walnuts. Eh, wouldn't come back here for that alone.  

The prices aren't too high, but they aren't too low. Medium priced, for what I order its about $12 per cup. I was full after drinking my hot chocolate. I felt like I overdosed on chocolate. 

To be completely honest, I felt sick, but its the kind where, its so good during the process...looking at the cup of chocolate, thinking, dang, I'm drinking a ton of calories and fat, and having a great time doing it. These drinks have nice consistency to them, they go down nice. The dark chocolate drinks are SO strong, but SO flavorful. Its like magic going down the tube. 

I love a good cup of fancy hot chocolate.

If this place weren't in Montreal, I'd be a regular, butttt the next time I find myself in that area, I'd surely return."}
{"text":"I just came back from Montreal. While I was here, I had brunch with Juliette et chocolat for three days straight once I discovered it. Just something great about having some hot chocolate and crepes by the sidewalk in the morning. Took my friends here the 2nd day that were also in town for the wedding. We kept coming back. They have a variety of unique chocolate, I'm not an expert but all I get here in California is nutella on all the crepes. Nice to see a change!"}
{"text":"Overall :
Good chocolate drinks, delicious crepes.  The alcoholic options were a little underwhelming, and the line to sit down was daunting, but overall worth stopping in if you're passing by.

Drinks :
My partner and I both had alcoholic chocolate drinks.  She had the nutcracker, and I had the Spicy Sunset.  Both were good, and you could taste the quality of the chocolate, and the thought that went into blending the flavor.  That said, I think I would have enjoyed a non-alcoholic option much more.  The alcohol was actually discordant compared to the rest of the drink, and it was tantalizingly \"almost perfect\"

Food : 
Oh god the crepes.  My partner had a plain sugar crepe and she was very happy with just that.  I had the salted caramel crepe and I wanted to take it home with me to live happily ever after.  The texture was perfect and the sauce was delightful.  Just thinking about it makes me happy.  Is it legal to marry a crepe in Canada?

Service :
We decided to go in because there was literally a line out the door when we walked by.  Despite that it moved pretty fast, and they didn't argue with us when we asked to wait by the side for an outside table.  They were pretty close to closing and that was definitely a distraction, but overall I'd say service was pretty good."}
{"text":"Seems like a great dessert place if you come in to order a dessert from their sit down restaurant. I just wanted a sweet treat to satisfy my chocolate cravings. I ended up getting a brownie which was already shrink wrapped rather than one from the display case. While the brownie was alright it wasn't anything special given the price paid for a small pre-packaged brownie. The staff  was not the most attentive as I had to get their attention to pay despite there being more staff than customers."}
{"text":"Overindulgence, chocolate overload, sweet sweet diabetic coma, whatever you want to call it - Juliette Et chocolat will give it to you. 

Your eyes will glaze over all the colossal chocolate filled menu. You won't decide what to eat immediately, it will take a few moments and perhaps a sip of one of their many artisanal hot chocolates to help your decision along.

The serivce was quirky. I couldn't tell if our waiter was just ridiculously polite or flirting with my friend and I. Perhaps it was his quasi-Franco-European allure, or his giant pearly white smile, with an oh so slight arch of the eyebrow?  Perhaps he had a small family to feed and relied on the big tips American women would leave. Either way, I digress, enough about him. 

I came for dessert only and had some sort of layed concoction of dark chocolate and caramel in a petite mason jar. Rich, tasty and thick. Definitely worth the indulgence. I also picked one of the spicy hot chocolates which to me, didn't have much kick at all. 

If you have a sweet tooth, Juliette et chocolate is worth checking out either way. Just don't expect it to be quiet or without an arduously long wait!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Love their huge selections of brownies. I had the caramel brownie with sauce and I felt like I was in heaven. Service was great and didn't wait long at all to get what I wanted. I'd keep on going here as it's so fresh and delicious. Their quality of food is consistent plus I feel like it's cheap to get a good chocolate night out with your friends or partners. To all chocolate lovers, I'd recommend it"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's so cute, kind of like a Serendipity. One of the best coffees I've ever had. I brought back the hot chocolate in a jar to give to my friends as gifts. They all loved it. I wish there were a place like this in Miami!"}
{"text":"Une envie de chocolat en après midi? En soirée? N'importe quand? On file chez Juliette et Chocolat. On commande une fondue, on choisit son chocolat préféré, des fruits ou des marshmallow... On commande l'assiette du temps des sucres avec 3 énormes desserts et un chocolat chaud à partager. On commande une verrine de crème praliné ou au chocolat. On commande un chocolat chaud au nutella. On commande un brownie ou un fondant au caramel. Attention au sugar crush... Mais qu'est ce que ça fait du bien!!"}
{"text":"We would not go back. 
We ended up walking out. We were seated immediately and served water but no one came to check on us after that.
We were right there at the wait station. No one looked our way. We had to ask for a server. 
We left after 25 minutes. 
We had reservations across the street at Maestro SVP. They know how to treat customers. 
We actually came back because this place had been highly recommended.
This time we were seated and taking care of after we had told the hostess of our experience earlier - so the server came within a couple of minutes. 
We ordered the chai tea. It was excessively sweet and lacked chai.
We also had a decaf cappuccino. They charge an extra $.60 for decaf.
We also ordered a mint chocolate herbal tea. There was nothing special about it.
Then we ordered the grandma's hot chocolate. We requested whipped cream on top of it. We were told they did not have whipped cream.  We all thought that was odd.
The table in front of us had three Sundaes. They all had huge toppings of whipped cream.
Our bill was 19.60
Overrated and overpriced. If you want good hot chocolate go to Suite 88. They were very friendly and they even brought us four pieces of domed chocolate. Complimentary."}
{"text":"This iconic montreal dessert place only focus on 3 things....chocolate , chocolate, and chocolate....lol

If there was 1 thing they specialize and out on everything....its chocolate. Its a dessert place wherein you can choose white, 33% milk.choco, 55% dark, or for the extremist...70% dark. 

U order a choco brownie...u guessed it...come with a small.jar of chocolate sauce. Order a molten lava cake...u pour the chocolate in the center. 

We ordered the crepe with bananas and strawberries. It was served open and we picked the milk chocolate....not the nuttela one. 

They have waffles , trifles, banna splits..all loaded with real chocolate sauce...

For the ultimate choco lovers...they even serve chocolate in brandy glasses and have a tasting menu for them. Lol. 

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I really hate giving negative reviews, I do but this place irked me so much I felt the need to post about.

Yesterday I was in the area having lunch with my husband, daughter, and father in law. My daughter was so well behaved I decided to go get her a treat. My friend always raves about Juliette et Chocolat so I figured what a nice place to get her some chocolate.

I walk in and there is a line up at the door of people waiting to be seated. I don't want to be seated, I just want to grab some brownies and various chocolates and bail. I go stand in front of the counter waiting for someone to acknowledge me. 10 minutes and NOTHING. About 5 different girls in those red hats come to the counter to grab something (menus etc) and walk away before I could even say anything. By now I've looked at their entire selection and I've tallied up an order in my head of what I'd like to get. A few bags of brownies, some chocolate with pecans, and some little truffle like chocolate. Man its going to cost me $100 to get chocolate and I just baked the day before! 

I decide to go wait in line and when I'm asked how many I'll just say its to go. I get in line and wait another 15 minutes. Still NOTHING. Instead of causing a scene I decide to just walk out and let Juliette et Chocolat kiss my money goodbye.

I won't ever even think about going here again. If I have to wait 25 minute to NOT be served I'd rather take my money elsewhere. 

Also, very over priced for chocolate..."}
{"text":"Qui n'aime pas le chocolat ? Adresse parfaite pour calmer une rage de chocolat. J'ai choisi le brownie végétalien qui est complètement décadent ! J'étais partie pour prendre un chocolat chaud pour l'accompagner mais je me suis ravisée pour un thé, ça faisait un peu trop de chocolat... Mes amies ont pris les fondues, ça semblait très copieux et très très gourmand ! 
Amis végétaliens, sachez qu'il est possible de remplacer le lait par du lait végétal dans votre chocolat chaud :)"}
{"text":"Reminds me of a mini Max Brenners with a French flare. They serve anything chocolate ranging from ganaches to shakes to lava cakes. They also have an array of sweet and savory crepes. Everything appeared delicious. We ordered a whipped cream dessert with bits of brownies topped off with chocolate and salty caramel. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Juliette & Chocolat is a cafe, creperie, and chocolate bar (yes, a \"bar a chocolat\"). Smoking is permitted outside, so we opted to go indoors. After a slight wait, we found ourselves in their air conditioned, smoke-free interior. This is a popular place and it's easy to see why. Just glance through their menu - complete with photos and English/French text (helpful for those who can't translate quickly) - and you'll find their offerings are simply outstanding!

Our server was genial, helping us through our agonizingly difficult selection process. After much deliberation, I settled for an really strong espresso-flavored dark chocolate brownie (C$3.45) that literally had crunchy coffee beans in it, and a rich, chocolatey flavor. To balance, I had a mango sorbet, which had a refreshingly cold, refreshingly smooth, vibrant taste. I took a bite of brownie with mango on top, and I was in heaven. (I sampled my friend's pear crepe and nutty bowl, both which were surprisingly good.) [See my photos!]

If I could legally marry Juliette (and Chocolat), I would. Recommended."}
{"text":"I will give them 2.5/5 but for the petite pot I round it to a 3


One of the water we were given had some black specs in it.... ewww

Deserts rating
4/10 - Hot chocolate - too thick for me more like soup. A bit Peru chocolate (avoid it)

4/10 - The trifle  - It's basically caramel and whip cream layers... with little brownie ... too sweet. over kill (avoid it)


9/10  Passion fruit petite pot - omg yummy.  Tart and sweet. I would have given  it 10 if they give me a bigger size.

{"text":"Went for a little chocolate treat tonight at the dix30 location. Service was okay but I thought it could've been better if the employees would have better attention on the floor... They kept talking to each other so we just sat there waiting to order.

Finally, I think the deserts we're not as well prepared as the location on saint-Denis street... Maybe a better manager would be a good idea.."}
{"text":"Sweet tooth craving? Not sure if you should have a brownie or lava cake? I know it's hard to choose between the 2... why not get both? Haha 
This is a classic hangout spot located on saint Laurent boul right in the middle of one of Montreal's hottest streets.
Luckily for me, when i craved chocolate this place wasn't lacked nor busy.. (thank god). 
I ordered the famous \"brookie\" which combines both of my favorite desserts with a cappuccino. Well my night couldn't have ended any better If a can be honest.
The staff at this one are extremely friendly and gave that extra effort to satisfy us with our sweet tooth :)

I kept this short and sweet.. (just like my dessert) ha! But would come back here again because out of all the juliette and chocolate.. I feel like this one has better service and location is amazing!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pour les amoureux du chocolat, il vous faut absolument tester un Juliette et Chocolat! Cette succursale est très agréable et la carte est pleinement fournie en desserts chocolatés. Ce n'est pas offert mais c'est toujours sympa de finir la soirée par un bon dessert chez eux. Les brownies sont parfaits!"}
{"text":"A really great date place if either of you are into chocolate. In the winter, definitely try the grandma-style hot chocolate...it's out of this world. On the weekend, expect to wait 10-25 minutes if you're coming in the evening...it's quite busy.

Be a good date and share some a fondu :)"}
{"text":"My sister lives in Montreal and insisted that when I visited, we dine at Juliette & Chocolat. Immediately, the space is quite lovely. With brick walls, nice lighting, and some touches of white embellishments on the high ceilings, the atmosphere was very pleasing. Not to mention the display cases of assorted chocolates! Now those were enticing...

We began with a shared decadent, chocolate-based beverage with an alcoholic touch of creme de menthe, served chilled in a martini glass with a dollop of peppermint-laced whipped cream. Following this delightful bevvy, we decided on sharing a crepe avec poivre, fromage de chevre, et de miel with a side of mixed greens. Once it arrived, in a very timely manner, we consumed what lay on the plate. The crepe was served at the perfect temperature for the fromage de chevre to be all melty, allowing us to spread the cheese around the crepe. Mmmm, yum! After that, we decided to try another crepe which we were also first interested in, with balsamic reduction, fromage de chevre, and roasted tomatoes. This second crepe was gone as quickly as the first! Delectable indeed.

What a fantastic (first) experience at this gem of a chocolate restaurant! Definitely returning before my departure from Montreal, perhaps when we have more of a chocolate craving for a dessert dish!"}
{"text":"Loud,crowded,music pounding from the club upstairs,people constantly streaming in and out. The waitresses are certainly kept busy running back and forth;the prices are definitely on the high side,but the desserts are very rich. I had a intense brownie paired with Earl Grey tea,my friend ordered a tiramisu and chai. My brownie arrived with my Earl Grey tea,and I must say,I was not impressed with the tiny size of the brownie,that is until I thought I would not be able to finish it,it is really VERY rich. The tea was good,but not exceptional,the teapot only half-full! My friend's tiramisu was really a pudding served in a jar,her chai was not what she had thought it would be,she ended up sending it back and ordered an Earl Grey as well. Service was timely and courteous."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place...I just don't have the sweet tooth to appreciate it but one of my best friend always drags me here for dessert so I have grown to like this place. The creeps are good."}
{"text":"Great desserts!! We have tried four things from the menu so far and everything tastes great and is gooey and chocolaty every time!! 
Hot chocolate is amazing as well. Perfect spot for winter evenings. 
Service is super nice and give great advice. Have already been here twice and we plan on coming here more often through the upcoming winters!!"}
{"text":"Must visit place if you have sweet tooth, its too much carving food, must try at least once and service is also good"}
{"text":"Ha ma belle Juliette, ton chocolat me fait mourir. Mourir d'envie, mourir de plaisir, mourir de remords. Qu'on ne s'y méprenne, ils ont des salades et d'excellentes galettes de sarrasin (celle au chèvre, poire et miel est divine), mais on vient ici pour le chocolat. Que ce soit sous forme de chocolat chaud, de boissons alcoolisées, de crêpes, de brownies ou de gâteaux, on peut pas (et il ne faut pas!) passer à côté. 

La carte des chocolats chauds est impressionnante, et il est intéressant de constater à quel point les arômes du cacao changent selon leur provenance. J'ai personnellement un faible pour le Saint-Dominique ainsi que pour l'Irish, un cocktail de chocolat fait à base de whisky, et bien que le verre de chocolat peut être assez dispendieux, la quantité qu'on nous présente comble nos envies chocolatées à la perfection. Et sinon, on peut toujours y aller avec un abordable et classique Viennois, un somptueux chocolat chaud surmonté d'une légère crème fouettée. 

Dès ma première visite, j'ai totalement craqué pour leur caramel fleur de sel. Il m'est donc impossible de penser à une visite chez Juliette sans me prendre un dessert au chocolat et caramel. Mon coup de coeur va au Fondant au chocolat recouvert de caramel fleur de sel et une boule de crème glacée noisette. Les petits pots étagés chocolat-caramel-brownies sont aussi très bons lorsqu'on a une petite faim ou un budget serré, et si on se sent ogre le trifle est tout simplement .. monstrueux!

La location sur Saint-Laurent est ma préférée; grande, aérée, éclairée et mieux adaptée pour les groupes. Je n'ai jamais eu de problèmes avec le service et c'est un point de rencontre fréquent pour moi et mes amis puisqu'on sait qu'on est toujours assurés d'être satisfait de notre expérience. Le seul problème c'est après, quand tu te lèves et que tu peux plus reboutonner ton pantalon; là tu te dis que c'est le temps d'enfiler tes pantalons de jogging!"}
{"text":"A lot has been said, so I'll keep it brief. 
Very nice, slightly underground patio.
Buckwheat crepes - one of the best I've ever had with very interesting toppings in sweet and savoury.
Good chocolate. It could be overwhelmingly rich, so chose carefully and savour!
Coffee is good, just not hot enough. I kept trying first with caramel mocha, then espresso, and finally an americano. It was me searching for coffee heaven that morning. The amount of whipped cream on top of that mocha - boy, it could easily have been a meal in itself."}
{"text":"I was planning on meeting a friend to catch up and wanted a simple cafe. Juliette served up a good environment to talk and get a bite to eat. I had a dessert for breakfast (how could one resist?). I ordered the Peanut butter, milk chocolate and banana crepe. It was great. It wasn't too heavy but combine a lot of my favorite things, how could you not go wrong?

In addition, my friend and I stayed a bit longer to talk. They didn't try to usher us out and were very polite about my non-french speaking capabilities (however Montreal makes me want to take a class).

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try a classic crepe in Montreal so I made my way over to Juliette Et Chocolate alone on a Thursday evening.

The place was fairly busy, I waited in line for about twenty minutes before I was seated. The menu was very large and I would have had trouble deciding what I wanted if I had not already had something in mind. 

I ordered a half-dark, half-milk chocolate, banana and strawberry crepe. The server was sweet and charming and brought me my dessert within ten minutes. 

It was exactly how I wanted it. The fruit was fresh, the chocolate warm and the crepe recipe sweet and soft. 

Everyone around me looked very happy, there were many couples and groups of friends. The environment is warm and welcoming, and perfect for anyone planning on eating alone as well."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and with my friends and we weren't impressed. 

Service 2/5: The service was slow, def not somewhere to go if you're rushing. We wanted to have a quick simple lunch and were stuck for 2 hours even though the restaurant was less than half full. The bathrooms were also not very well kept as there was toilet water all over the floor.

Cleanliness 1/5: Absolutely everything was dirty. My tea glass had chocolate all over the outside, the cutlery was dirty, the water glasses had white and black stuff floating inside and my friends cup had tea leaves in it. 

Drinks 1/5: My friend ordered the Vienna hot chocolate and it was like drinking melted ice cream. It was way too thick and sweet. I had the creme earl grey tea which was very watery no matter how long I let it steep and they only had \"dairy milker\", no real cream or milk.

Food 3/5: I ordered the Mexitalian crepe which had tomatoes, guac and bocconcini on a buckwheat crepe. It was not bad but not amazing. My boyfriend got the pop eye salad which had fresh veggies but the chicken was bland and dry (very clearly frozen). However, my meal came with a chocolate dessert crepe and that was delicious!"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me at all, knows that I'm a true chocoholic. So upon the recommendation of a couple friends, I went straight to Juliette & Chocolat on my Montreal trip this past weekend, before I even checked into my hotel.

We reached at around 10pm on a Friday, were seated immediately, and received our food 10 minutes after ordering, so service was efficient.  

Mine: \"Chocolate waffle\" - Homemade Belgian waffle with ice cream, melted chocolate, and chocolate pearl balls. 
I was really disappointed that the waffle wasn't warm/fresh - isn't the point of a waffle being homemade at a dessert restaurant, that it will be freshly made? The ice cream, chocolate sauce and pearl balls were tasty. The pearl balls however were in a mini bowl that was very clearly chipped badly. 

His: \"Medley Chocolat\" - Vanilla ice cream with chocolate brownie. 
Extremely rich brownie, closer to the consistency of fudge than typical brownies - he enjoyed it. It also came with a bitter chocolate ganache that had a coffee-type aftertaste.

Lemonade ice tea: decent, nothing special. 

Total was $26 after tax / before tip. 

If I visit Montreal again, I'll either give Cacao 70 a try or order something other than the waffle from J&C."}
{"text":"Un super concept qui manque cruellement sur Paris ! On se délecte du chocolat traditionnel ! hummm (traditionnel = pointe de lait en +) Des recettes originales notamment pour les broonies dont je ne suis habituellement pas très friante. Ils sont étonnamment gourmands (un seul petit carré vous suffira donc ;) Je me suis laissée tentée par un chocolat blanc coco.
Un service sympathique et souriant où l'on s'était souvenu de mon visage (passé une heure avant pou repérage) ! J'ai vraiment apprécié le lieu, idéal pour une pause l'après-midi ! Le soir l'endroit parrait souvent victime de son succès ... À en juger par la longue file d'attente face à la devanture ;)"}
{"text":"I was recently in Montreal with my boyfriend, checking out Yelp for some yummy place to grab a snack.  Based on the helpful review from Laurence, we decided that this might be our spot!

Although we got there around 10:00pm on a Monday night, there was a line to get a table.  We waited patiently, and it was definitely worth it.  We  ordered some crepes, hot chocolate, and a milkshake (I can't turn down a good milkshake).  Everything was delicious!  Many choco-centric menu items are offered in varying degrees of sweet and bitter, so everyone is sure to find something to suit their tastes.

For those of you who are not entirely interested in sampling the desserts, there are also savory items on the menu--buckwheat crepes with goat cheese, ham, asparagus, etc.  Didn't get to try them this time, but I would definitely stop by again if I had the chance!"}
{"text":"Really great experience loved everything we got! From the lava cake, to the fondue and the crepe, everything was excellent! Prices were decent and service was very good. Would 100% recommend for visitors! Do not leave without trying this dessert spot! You wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First place I wandered into in Montreal looking for a late dinner; the savory crepes are definitely not the stars of the menu- the milkshakes and sundaes looked the best!"}
{"text":"My daughter discovered this place that is within 2 blocks of her apartment. I have been there twice and had the Dark Thick Hot Chocolate. It is totally deliciously decadent. It reminds of a cafe on Rue de Rivoli in Paris. 

I did not, on either visits, sample the food. In my mind this place is not about that. I suspect they will not survive, in the long run, but it's fun while it lasts. 

As a point of comparison Soma is about 35% better."}
{"text":"The fact that this place mainly sells desserts is like heaven on earth for me. We wanted something sweet & looked up the highest rated dessert-sequel shops & luckily found this treasure-trove. I had the Le Fondant Au Chocolat & it was absolutely exquisite. Fast service, awesome staff, & decadent treats!"}
{"text":"A great chocolate dessert place with pleasant atmosphere. Great hazelnut ice cream. But the wait staff here are mostly dolts and therefore cost this place at least a star. Things like, taking 5 minutes to get you seated even though the place is half empty and three of the waiters walked past without much of an acknowledgement, plunking down a carafe of water for the table when you were almost done with the sweet chocolate desserts."}
{"text":"Had lunch and dessert here with the parentals and my girlfriend. Quite enjoyed the food (the ice cream sandwiches are incredibly good and nicely presented), and the service was friendly. My only beef is with their prices, which strike me a little steep for what one gets."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this location over the one on Saint Denis. This one is larger, cleaner, often less crowded (or, at least it feels that way because it is so much larger) and has a more relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"All your usual Juliette et Choclat fare, but in a smaller, more subterranean location than the other location on Saint Laurent. While I have no issues with the food or coffees at this location, I prefer the one on Saint Laurent for the larger and more relaxed dining space. There's just more room on Saint Laurent. The atmosphere here can feel a little cramped when it's crowded. Good spot for a reasonably priced treat and the cafe au laits are excellent. I was rather disappointed with the bathroom here the last time I visited- not very clean!"}
{"text":"If you consider yourself a chocoholic, this is the place for you. The whole menu has a variety of options, including sweet and savoury. The savoury side consists of crepes and salads, while the sweet side consists of things like brownies, crepes, ice cream, pastries, chocolate drinks and liqueurs. 

I ordered the ivoire brownie, which is one of the best things I've ever had. It's a brownie made with white chocolate and coconut, and is really delicious. Highly recommended! In addition, their crepes and chocolate liqueurs are amazing as well.

I went to the location on St. Denis, and it was packed. If you don't mind waiting for up to an hour to get a seat, then go to that location. I am not sure about how busy it is at the other locations in the city, as I was visiting Montreal from Toronto and a friend introduced me to this place.

It was well worth the wait though, the food is amazing and the atmosphere of the place is cozy and inviting. I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"I only had the \"milk\" hot chocolate but it was THE BEST hot chocolate that has ever passed my lips.  By the time I got to the bottom I was chewing on little chocolate morsels.  SO GOOD!!! Swiss Miss will never be the same after experiencing Juliette Et Chocolat."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best desserts place I have visited in my life!

This restaurant looked so inviting from the outside - with its homely Christmas decorations and warm lighting ... perfect reprieve from the cold winter weather!

Friend ordered (and I tried): Chocolate Profiterole - they were WOW - the puffs had chunks of hard dark chocolate amidst premiere quality vanilla ice-cream. A dense layer of thick hot chocolate coated all three profiteroles. 4 stars for the profiteroles.

I ordered: The Medley which comprised an extreme brownie, vanilla ice-cream and a small flask of Grandma's Chocolate. This Medley was so melodious that I had the primitive urge to skip around the restaurant after savouring my first bite. Mind-blowing delicious. 4.5 stars for The Medley.

4 stars for its cozy ambience!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed Juliette et Chocolat.  While it is not obvious when you read the name, this restaurant also has fantastic main course options.  I thoroughly enjoyed my ham, egg, cheese, and spinach crepe.  I also don't think anyone can beat the brownies!"}
{"text":"Great stop for a late night desert!  After a delicious dinner at Laurier Gordon Ramsey next door we stopped at Juliette et Chocolate for desert.  The wait was long but worth it.  During our last visit to Montreal we went to the sister location on St. Laurent.  The Laurier location is the same in terms of food quality just a bit \"fancier\" spot with newer decor.  I would strongly recommend the molten chocolate cake with carmel topping.  For chocolate fans that have been to Angelina in Paris, this feels like a scaled down version of that over the top choclate stop and well worth the visit."}
{"text":"chocolate is good.......however if you find a favorite they'll most likely be out of it.

service is super slow and the staff are over run and look miserable there are not enough waiters or people to help wait tables and offer good service and there is no one dedicated person to help ring up people so getting your bill is tedious and long.  

normal meals are over priced and the chocolates as well but if you need something sweet it will do the job.

just don't count on the service to help"}
{"text":"I read reviews about this place and was excited to have dessert there. Chocolate is truly amazing, however the service left much to be desired. Once our server found out that we did not speak French, she became very curt and unpleasant. She gave us an attitude when we ordered a lot of food and then asked her to wrap it up. It should not be a big deal, but her energy ruined our appetites and the overall greatness of the place. If you are an American or just don't speak French, don't expect good service. Very disappointed..."}
{"text":"This place makes me religious, why, cos I wanna scream every religion's prophets while showing how much I loved this place.

The place is semi-underground and you kinda have to wait in line in order to be sit, which is not bad at all, cos the hot smell of chocolate keeps you busy on dreaming what you're gonna order, why ur gonna order that and how violently you're gonna devour THAT THING with the HOT CHOCOLATE. AWWWWH! greatnessssssssss.

I ordered this fantastic thing with vanilla ice-cream, topped with hot chocolate on top which had become frozen from the ice-cream and there was a triangular crepe to take ur mind-blowing chocolate experience to the highest level.

On Rue Saint-Denis on Latin Quarter this has to be tried at least 5-6 times while you're visiting other beauties of Montreal. 

When you get there and indulge into the chocolate experience, you'll remember Sunny from Yelp! I can assure you on that."}
{"text":"Have you, like me, had a lifetime of 'Augustus Gloop' envy, wondering what it would be like to fall into a chocolate river and drink to your heart's content? 

If so, here's your (golden) ticket to The Gloop Experience...save some nickels (quarters, actually), come here, and plan to order Alto el Sols until your eyeballs are swimming. You'll only end up drinking one, but you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you were ready/willing/able to drown in it. I drank 2 on separate occasions. Not gonna try to describe it. If you like chocolate, you're obligated to try one. 

Be warned, though, that drinking from the glass and using a spoon will leave a lot of chocolate up and down the sides of the snifter, and you with commensurate regret. 
During my 2nd visit (and after my 2nd 45-minute wait), I used a straw and drew from the middle of the brew. Only a few chocolate molecules were left on the sides of the glass. Airfare to Montreal, justified."}
{"text":"If you love chocolate, it's necessary to go here. 

Pros: 1) One word: Brookie. Yes that's a cookie baked inside of a brownie. It was as delicious as it sounds. My husband got an equally delicious nutella banana brownie. 2) the people who worked there were very helpful and cheery. 

Cons: 1) if you get these from the pastry counter to-go (as we did) they serve everything cold. Who wants to eat an ice-cold brownie? 2) Pricey. $11 for two brownies."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another go! I had only been to Juliette & Chocolat once when I had first moved to Montreal and was really disappointed. All this time, I had avoided it and chose other options instead.

For some reason, last Saturday around 11pm, I was craving a good luxury hot chocolate and dessert. If anywhere would have something open on the South Shore at that time, it would be Dix30. Juliette & Chocolat was buzzing, the place was quite full and people were still coming in so we figured they probably let people in until 11.45, even 12am I guess. 

I had felt sick after the caramel brownie trifle thing I had the first time, so we decided not to order too much to give the place another try. I ordered the 3 Chocolate with Marshmallows hot chocolate and the 'Brookie' brownie. Both were amazing, the brookie was right up my alley - half cookie and half brownie, what more could you ask for? Great for my indecisive self! The hot chocolate was tiny but delicious and very good quality of chocolate with a small heaping of marshmallows - expected more for the price though! (8$ for a tiny cup)

The service was excellent and the waitresses were all super friendly - in fact, one of them made a small error by bringing us the wrong order so we told her it wasn't ours. We didn't think too much of that but she 'felt bad,' so brought  over a  complimentary pot of hot Rooibos tea! I would never think to order that in a dessert place but the tea was super relaxing and flavourful! How lovely!
Had a wonderful experience this time and have truly been converted to a Juliette & Chocolat fan!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try Juliette and chocolat on my last trip to Montreal but we ran out of time. I visited Montreal a few weeks ago and made them our first stop. Parking was easy to find on the street but pricey. We knew we wanted to get white chocolate fondue and we were also considering a crepe. Even though I couldn't afford the calories we decided to also get the lemon meringue crepe since the waiter told us it's delicious. 

Our white chocolate fondue was not as good as I expected. The white chocolate did not have a ton of flavor. We ordered the dish that came with strawberries, bananas, waffles and brownies for dipping. The brownies were amazing but the waffles were terrible. First they were burnt so we had to send them back. They brought us a new set and they were extremely oily and tasted deep fried. I ate one and couldn't handle anymore. If you're going to get fondue I would suggest the fruit only. 

Our other order, the lemon meringue crepe was to die for! It was one of the best crepes I have ever eaten. What made it amazing was the lemon curd. I would go back for this dish alone. 

The service was alright but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"So we were walking through the street in montreal in search of a dessert place:
1) Person 1 to Person 2: I will take Julliete and you take the chocolate
2) Person 2: Deal!

After having their chocolate
ME: I will take Juliette and the chocolate, i will take everything they have to offer, thank you!

Chocolate HEAVEN! why don't we have this in Toronto??

Service:
Our server was really courteous, he helped us through the menu items and made recommendations based on our taste. I really like their uniforms, neat white and cute looking lol. We were thirsty and the server filled out glasses multiple times, we didn't even have to ask him. The place was super busy though.

Food:

They had soo many types of drinking chocolate, i didn't even know this was possible.
We all had different things from the menu and nothing was short of delicious!

The drinking choclate was thick and without any sugar, as if it was made for hardcore choclate lovers. The Cheese cakes, waffles and every other thing we had was delicious!

I wish i had more time in montreal so we could try more of their stuff. Whenever i go back, i am definitely going there again."}
{"text":"Happened up on this chocolate heaven one night while walking around.  Love coming here., great atmosphere, friendly staff and great fondu.  Haven't tried any of their savory menu items yet but they do look very good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this spot - a huge menu of different items, all chocolate!  I was here on two occasions and had brownies, which were incredibly rich and moist (these were gluten free too!), and had their sundaes, which were a decadent dessert.  It's nice to have a relaxing and comfortable place to enjoy chocolate desserts."}
{"text":"Never in my life have I had a sweet tooth. But this one particular night, while roaming the streets of Montreal I stumbled upon this gem. As I walked in, I noticed this group of people in the back whipping and chocolate syruping their hearts out. 

I walk to them and immediately they read my mind. My first time in Montreal, they recommended the cheesecake trifle.

Layers of fudgy dark chocolate brownie chunks, hazelnut praline cream, luscious cheesecake sauce and sweet whipped cream, served with velvety thick dark hot chocolate.

Yes, you read that correctly. 

So good, that I convinced the group to attend for brunch the next day. Sweet deal. Along with your meal, their brunch comes with:
* A choice of café au lait, or chocolaccino, or tea
* A glass of orange juice
* A small homemade seasonal cake
* Unsweetened yogurt with homemade seasonal fruit compote and our gourmet chocolate granola

Definitely a great choice if you're visiting the city."}
{"text":"Local Queen of Chocolates, Ms. Juliette has created a modern & chic cafe style ambiance, delightful desserts, and impeccable buckwheat crepes and classic flavors. One of the best crepes in my humble opinion outside of Brittany. It's open all day from 11 AM, so stop in any time for a cup of coffee, glass of wine with some classic french sweet and savory offerings."}
{"text":"Great spot for a casual dessert date in Montreal.  This was one of those random finds during our off the beaten path excrusions when one of my girldfriends decided to check out the street that was decorated with lights.  We arrived shortly after dinner around 8pm and had no wait.  But when we left about an hour later there was a long line. We ordered two crepes Strawberry nutella and a banana vannilla with chocolate.  Definitely ask for the nutella.  If you have had nutella compared to chocolate there is a difference. 

Tip: Great for groups since they split the bill for you hassle free."}
{"text":"Really cute place. The food is exquisite and the whole ambience makes you feel as if you are in chocolate heaven. Be prepared for a bit of wait but it will totally be worth it."}
{"text":"Heaven. Chocolate heaven. And the crepes are fantastic too. My kids wanted to go here every day we were in Montreal. I couldn't blame them."}
{"text":"Great place for chocolate desserts in Montreal. It all about the chocolate here even though there are other items on the menu.

Shared a couple desserts with friends:

Squirrel: Crepe filled with nutella topped with i cream, nuts and marshmallow bits. I'm usually not a crepe fan but this dessert was amazing! crepe was nice and thin, nutella was not too sweet. All the ingredients just blended well together

Hazelnut praline bomb: I was expecting this to be a heavy dessert by the looks but don't be fooled. The chocolate is mouse like and it was pillows of light chocolate hitting your tongue.

Grandma's hot chocolate: I was not impressed with the drinking chocolate. It was super thick! more like a dip and found it hard to drink. Wished I had some fruit or marshmallows to dip it in.

I liked how there was a lot of seating here. Great for big groups or kids."}
{"text":"Delicious but they know it so the prices are way too high and the service is a bit iffy.   But,.... It's like Disneyland for chocolate lovers.  We were lured from across the street on a very cold night by a very cute storefront.  Once we peaked behind the red curtain we were enchanted and left with a much lighter wallet, warm fuzzies and a sugar buzz.  I'm not sure if go out of my way due to the cost and because Montreal has yummies everywhere but if wonder in again if I were around."}
{"text":"I waffle about a place like this, it is a place I try to make a habit of going to late at night but it has a very Jekyl and Hyde persona.  I try to make an effort to go here everytime I am in Montreal, but last time made me rethink.

Juliette could best be described as a chocolate house, with a dessert option that also provides crepes.  Emphasis though is on chocolate in many forms.  Cups of cocoa with variations of chocolate from around the world.  white,milk,dark and various spices are presented in huge brandy snifters for you to enjoy.  They are decadant and world class.  Brownies, tortes abound, and not blase creations either, they may look simple but are filled with solid mouthwatering ingredients.

The place and menu has expanded greatly too, but the seating and service is really hit and miss.  On a superb cold December night I was here on a slightly less crowded but still very busy time, drinking ganache and whiskey.  It was pure heaven.  Many of the alcohol options though you will have to order with a crepe since they can't serve it without \"food\" by law, which is too bad, but rules are rules I guess...

Unfortunatly though service here can be painfuly bad.  Much of the wait stuff is straight out of high school or at least still in it judging by how young they look.  A return visit this August for myself, on a time when the city has more tourists provided nothing but pure chaos as our server quit her shift before we could even get our bill.

sigh...

The good thing is you can walk out of here spending 20-30 dollars and getting a good fill on exquisite and fun chocolate, but the service can be attrocious, and the chance to get a table very difficult. It is quite popular. The staff also doesn't look like they are having a lot of fun either most nights, they just look totally slammed.  Too bad, because when this place is in a good rhythm it's phenomenal."}
{"text":"Not so much GF friendly. 
More 
Gluten Free & Lactose Free
options please.

It is a shame. We have 2016. 

Staff friendly."}
{"text":"Really 4.5:

We came here for dessert and got the chocolate fondant and the fleur de sel medley. The fondant was great but the fleur de sel medley was amazing. The caramel sauce was perfectly creamy without being too sweet and the brownie was delicious. I'd recommend the hazelnut ice cream. It's got just the right amount of nuttyness and meshes with the brownie well. Our server was also very friendly and made sure to explain everything to us non-french speakers. 

The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is that it took a while for our food to arrive and the portions weren't too big so make sure to order plenty if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Delicious chocolate. I got a couple of different pieces of chocolate, all were yummy. What was even better- their brownies. They are to die for. I got 4 different kinds and all were just as good as the other."}
{"text":"Chocolate. Enough said.

Seriously. Yelp wants me to write more.

It's chocolate. That's all you need to know. Is CHOCOLATE! IT'S CHOCOLAAAAAAAAATE!"}
{"text":"OMG, I dont even like chocolate that much but found myself drinking 2 cups of hot chocolate, eating chocolate fondue with 2 different kinds of chocolate, and devouring a brownie.  

Something about the chocolate here...its perfectly rich without tasting overly processed. You can pick from extra bitter, semi-sweet, milk, and white. Also, there are a variety of different types of chocolate to pick from for your hot chocolate drink as well. 

If you are a chocolate lover, you should really really really try this place."}
{"text":"The fondue with fresh fruit was simply delicious, and the trifle was one of my husband's favorite desserts he's ever had.  The waitress was very sweet.  This seems like one of those places where you can't go wrong with whatever you order.  It's the only place we are planning to visit twice during our short trip in Montreal, because it was so good.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"An entire restaurant devoted to the brown stuff. We just got hot chocolate to go this time, the best $6 cup you'll ever have. Almost needed a spoon."}
{"text":"Very nice decor, and really great concept. 

I always used to see small line-ups in front of this place and the St-Denis location. I finally decided to go and take a look at the menu. I only tried two of their specialized hot chocolates, and they were bot extremely good.

This is a great place to hand out."}
{"text":"The location is fancy. Display is like something from a movie. Overall the atmosphere is everything you look forward to for dessert. Tried the waffle but wasn't impressed at all. Although the ice cream was delicious, the waffle itself wasn't fresh at all. Definitely recommend getting a coffee from here."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, nice hot chocolate and in one word : Chocolate heaven"}
{"text":"Chocolate overload...!
We ordered the chocolate fondue for two. We ordered it with milk and white chocolate. It came with a wide variety of fresh fruit 
It was definitely enough for 3 maybe 4 people. My boyfriend tried the semi sweet ganache shot? It was super sweet... Just like your standard chocolate frosting
The chocolate milk shake was horrible...


The service was really slow and everyone looked confused Lol"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  Chocolate heaven.  We wandered into here upon me deciding that I wanted to end the night with some chocolate.  My group ended up getting 2 crepes, 1 sundae, 1 fondant, 1 alcoholic drink and my hot chocolate.  All of us shared bites from everything.  

As nessa stated, the alcoholic drink was interesting.  I forgot what we ordered but it was the one that had the spicy kick to it.  Good, think but interesting nonetheless.

My hot chocolate came in a small pitcher and a latte mug.  The hot chocolate was so think and rich even though i got the bittersweet chocolate -- my kind of hot chocolate.  

Both the crepes (apple  and strawberry/banana) were great.  Crepes were light and think, with a drizzle of dark chocolate covering the fruit.

The sundae and the fondant were lovely as well."}
{"text":"This was an horrible location and had an overall awful experience. The staff was ill mannered and rude from the time we walked through the door. When asked to be seated the server told us they were busy and walked off without asking if we would like to wait. The lady serving us threw down our food on the table spilling our drink everywhere! The cup was broken and the waffles were cold and stale. The server did not apologize and continued to serve us with a horrible attitude. I'm very disappointed in how we were treated at this location. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and got two brownies and two cappuccinos to-go (Note: Don't bother with coffee/cappuccinos get the hot cocoa). Service was nice but flaky. We got our order to go and it seems as if we introduced a novel concept to Julette.

It took nearly fifteen minutes to get two brownies and two cappucinos all the while we did our best to stay out the way in a very busy entrance.  Our cappucinos were handed to us in plastic cups (which were warping from the heat), and our brownies were tossed unceremoniously into paper bags.

Classic brownie was terrible. Something that I could have gotten out of a package or from a super market. The classic was dry, and was most certainly stale and may have been a shrink-wrapped brownie from a gas station.

Luckily we got another more expensive brownie which was fantastic and blended dark, milk, and white chocolate. Moist, dense, ever-so-slightly gooey It still suffered from being a little too sweet and not quite as rich as I was hoping for. But a chocolate experience much more on-par from a place like this. My partner and I shared this second brownie after tossing the first and it was plenty for two.

But overall this place strikes me as awfully pricey for what it serves up. Nothing here is significantly more awesome than you'd get at a solid bakery (and some if it is quite bad)."}
{"text":"Beautiful quaint café. Very bright and clean looking.
I enjoy desserts, but I think everything was too sweet and too rich for my liking. 

I wouldn't order the hot chocolate again (unless they can do it without sugar), but I would try the coffee or latte."}
{"text":"Cafe with a great motto: chocolate is good for the soul. If you're like me - you love chocolate but am wary of the overwhelming sweetness it can sometimes surprise you- fear not, the homemade 70% cocoa Grandma's hot chocolate and the marshmallows are a wonderful combination. 

Grandma's hot chocolate (70%): comes in a little pot with a bowl for you to pour as you go. However, it does cool down quite quickly. The servers though, are very kind to offer to heat it up for you again if need be. Awesome attentive service!!! 

Homemade marshmallows: delightfully surprised at how neutral (sweetness-wise) it was. Pairs perfectly well with the hot chocolate. 

We also tried:

 Nutella crepe. It was very fresh and they were very generous with the Nutella servings. Loved it. 

Liege waffle: wellll done!

overall: Sweet date spot"}
{"text":"Très bon mais je n'aime pas les locaux. On sent qu'on a affaire à une franchise,  il n'y aucune âme dans les restaurants, c'est ce qui me manque quand j'y vais, il n'y a pas de cachet"}
{"text":"Sat there for half an hour before someone came to see us, maybe 45 mins before we got our plates by that time our coffee was cold. Asked for coffee again, took them another 15 mins and I had to get up and go ask for it!! They look busy, but the place was full of staffs but probably 1 chef in the back.

Won't be back"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, I'd bookmarked this sweet shop so we could be sure and try it. After eating lunch on our first day in Montreal, we stopped by here since it was just a few doors down. 

***The Trifecta of Sweet Tastes while in Montreal***: Brownie, Fondu, and a Crepe. 

1st Sweet in Montreal: Le Banatella. Yep, your guessing right, a homemade, fresh as a baby's powdered butt, banana and Nutella brownie with crushed hazel nuts sprinkled atop. Rich, creamy brownie. Somewhat soft and gooey because of the mashed banana mixed is. It's real, folks. Stop pinching yourself. Instead of wasting time, just get a second one. 

2nd Nite's Visit: Fondu for two. I forget the name of the dish, but was their milk chocolate with hazelnut cream and crushed hazelnuts sprinkled on top. The wooden board is chuck full of fresh, juicy sweet fruits. And of course the chocolate stayed warm and a perfect liquid consistency. If it were up to me, I'd of just drank the damn stuff straight from the bowl. Jhezzz, the things we do so others can partake in your Ecstasy. 

Third and Final Visit : I tried one of their crepes (you didn't really expect me to pass up those dreamy desserts?). The Tuxedo Crepe: Warm, thin, fluffy pancake with there cheesecake cream sauce, milk chocolate drizzle, and homemade brownie chunks. Rolled that bad boy up and sliced off bites of pure bliss. The 70% dark, 55%, and 30% milk chocolates used here are the real deal. 

According to Yelp, there are 3 J&Cs around Montreal. This one is closer to the UQAM campus life, and smaller, too. But so freaking quaint! Why doesn't Columbus have a chocolate cafe? I mean! The servers were all wonderful. Life in Montreal is all about the experiences, so sitting and chatting over coffee for hours is no absurdity. We were never rushed, even though there seemed to always be a line at this locale. This establishment is so Parisian, and so welcoming. I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Had one of their savory crepes... the grilled tomato and goat cheese.  Excellent!  For dessert, the chocolate fondant with salted caramel.  Was also very good but should have been served warm."}
{"text":"I prefer the Saint Denis location which, although darker, has a better ambiance.

My suggestion - go with friends and share a fondue so you get some fruit. Order either an alcoholic chocolate drink (i highly recommend the  raspberry ruby - melting sherbet in hot chocolate is purrfect...), a crepe or a brownie. Their smoothies are also very good, but not the best choice of an outstanding menu. The Fleur de Sel brownie makes you roll your eyes. Leave the balsamic brownie unless you KNOW you'll like it - the taste is interesting, but sort of counteracts the whole chocolate craze.

If you're just walking by - the truffles are a great backpack snack well worth the money."}
{"text":"This cafe caught my eye often as we took the bus along Saint Laurent. Spacious and well lit, this dessert cafe offers a myriad of desserts. I ordered the brownie kebab and my boyfriend ordered a banana hazelnut crepe. My brownies were rich and a little too chocolate as it was drizzled with a milk chocolate and served with a chocolate sauce for dipping. The hazelnut banana crepe was good, however I enjoyed my brownies better mixing them together with the crepe for a better balancing of flavor. This cafe is for the instagram worthy pics as well as rich,sweet flavors."}
{"text":"In the Quartier Latin, near Université du Québec à Montréal. Close to the Grande Bibliothèque on the Saint-Denis street. 

If you love chocolate, this is the place to go. Hot chocolate is very thick. Don't wait until it is cold because you won't be able to drink it, you'll need a spoon to eat it.

You can use your laptop (or other wifi devices like the iPhone) to access the Internet at this location. This is an \"Ile sans fil\" hotspot (free acount, Ile sans fil is a non-for-profit grassroot group who manages hotspots in Montréal) but follow the rule: 1 hour for each 10 dollars you spend there (this rule is NEVER enforced formally but it is a question of honnor)."}
{"text":"Great desserts, average food, poor service.  Not the best combination.

We strolled by after reading about this place and found it to be somewhat busy on a Sunday afternoon. We ordered food and waited a while as the staff members constantly bumped into my chair as they opened a door (why did they seat us next to a storage room door I don't know).  When we were done we ordered dessert and waited. We then waited some more. We then asked our waitress about the dessert, she went to check.  We waited a little bit more. Then someone noticed we were irritated and asked us what we ordered. We waited some more and then she came back and asked us again.  Finally, we got the dessert and then paid and left."}
{"text":"This place is like a dream. I never thought a hot chocolate could be so good. Oh, how I wish we had a Juliette et Chocolat in San Francisco. The service was a great complement to the whole experience. I loved our server and I LOVED my hot chocolate. Gotta go back there before I fly back home!"}
{"text":"Overall the environment was very cozy!
Food was delicious but some how too sweet, i give it 3 stars because the service was okay and i didn't like that they put the napkins and utensils after we sat down. 

I had the waffle with banana and vanilla ice cream, topped with caramel and nuts. It was really good but it wasn't a regular size waffle, it was small and not fulfilling."}
{"text":"This place is all hype & a complete tourist trap. We waited in line into the sidewalk since this place is always flippin' busy beyond belief. Considering I am a chocoholic, I had to give this place a try per my friend who lives in Montreal. I was not impressed at all. We got the chocolate fondue for 2 & it wasn't even hot which didn't make sense to me. Our other friend got a crepe & it came out open which was even more strange. Crepes are supposed to be folded, hence why you put stuff in it."}
{"text":"These guys take their chocolate very seriously. I'v had the most decadent brownie ever here. I tried their intense chocolate brownie during my trip to Montreal and had to go back again for more the following day. 

Their brownies are a must try!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm writing this eight and 10 is because we were well served, Cedric gave us top-notch service, I was really  impressed by his great service and kindness. You could see him enjoying his work and giving his best show. It changed and affected my experience at this dessert place and def helped me enjoy more. We had vegan brownies and fruits with chocolate dip, nothing really special, good vibes though we sat outside in their mini terasse. Without Cedric 5/10, with: 8/10"}
{"text":"It has been a perfect day.

I have had chocolate.

* * *

Juliette and Chocolat is a hot chocolate restaurant.

Yes, they have sandwiches and salads for you to have a meal first.

Yes, they have other desserts.

But at the end of the day, it is the hot chocolate.

You can get classical cocoa in milk, with various kinds of chocolate,

(Bittersweet, Milk, White)

and various toppings .

(Marshmallows, Caramel, Nutella)


* * *
You can also go for the very pure, very classic, very unadulterated chocolate experience.

Pure chocolate melted down with only enough water to make it sippable.

Served in a snifter so all that chocolate flavor stays in the glass.

This is an intense communion with chocolate.

This is you talking one on one with your chocolate god.

This is you and chocolate taking your relationship to the next level.

* * *

It comes in three flavors based on the chocolate used.

65% Cacao Madagascar.

65% Cacao Peru.

80% Cacao Uganda.

I went for the 80% Cacao Uganda.

It was 4:30 in the afternoon when I finished the Cacao Uganda.

There was no point in doing any more traipsing around Montreal.

Our day was complete. Our day was full.

The sun had set in our hearts and everything was the way things needed to be.

My wife had the 65% Cacao Peru. That was more like a candy bar than the 80% Uganda.

It was also wonderful.

Her sun set in a different place in the west than mine did but it was a lovely delightful place too.

Technically they offer a sampler of three different chocolates served on a wooden tray in three different snifters.

It would be a night of love with first Taylor Swift, then Scarlett Johansson, then Jessica Biel.

You could do that - but each successive experience would undercut what went before.

Take just one snifter and be happy.

Save the other treats for another time.

* * *

And yes they have regular hot cocoa and milkshakes and lots of other stuff.

The world is full of wonderful things.

But sometimes just one wonderful thing is all you need to find contentment."}
{"text":"Chocolate Lovers unite! My out of town guests and I decided that calories were of no consequences this weekend, and I brought them to one of my favourite dessert places (my friends are die-hard chocolate lovers). 

Tonight we each got something and shared it.  We had the Chocolate fondue, The intense chocolate brownie, and the Medley with Fleur de sel caramel. I'm addicted to caramel with sea salt, it's my freakin' kryptonite, throw in a brownie and a scoop of ice cream, I died a little bit (literally cause I should know better as slightly lactose intolerant) but it was worth every bite. They actual got a couple of hot chocolates to help wash the chocolate down, I realized I just couldn't do it. 

They were so impressed by the place and the selection. Finally the handmade chocolate pieces (my favourite the peanut butter and jam) we purchased a couple of pieces to take out even though I couldn't hear the word chocolate without feeling a bit of sugar high mixed with oh-my-god we're crazy. 

The only issue about the area is the street parking isn't exactly plentiful and the construction around it doesn't help either."}
{"text":"This was the very first place I stopped to eat in Montreal and I have to say, I wasn't impressed at all.  Service is really lackadaisical - my water was given to me without ice (warm) and was never refilled.  It was also really hard to flag the wait staff down to place my order and get my bill (though I think that may have been a cultural misunderstanding - in a lot of places in Montreal I saw you went to the front to pay without a bill).  When delivering my ice cream and brownie to the table, the ice cream slipped off the brownie and hit the table on one side.  I watched in horror as my waiter just pushed the ice cream back on my plate.  Rather than dealing with refusing it, I just didn't eat that part of the ice cream.  But ick.  As it turned out, it was no great loss.  I mean, an ice cream and brownie is hard to mess up, and Juliette Et Chocolate's was fine, but nothing exceptional (I agree with Peter G. that I've had equally good brownies from supermarkets).  It certainly wasn't worth the $7 or $8 they charged for it.  Fortunately, all of my other Montreal gastronomic adventures went uphill from this.

I will say the patio is very, very nice.  It's a great place for people watching on Rue Saint-Denis.  Just don't expect refills on anything."}
{"text":"Yesterday I ordered a dulce de leche and pear crepe to go.  It was amazing!!! Super sweet and fresh, and a little different from the typical nutella or chocolate crepes I go for.  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is DUMP, and I cannot understand how they stay in business! NEVER again! Horrible service, Dirty, crowded, and the food was tasteless and expensive. I had the Nicoise Salad ($20.00) hardly any toppings or tuna, served with this pathetic buckwheat pancake on top. Everything felt dirty from the glasses to the dishes. They dont take Amex like most places in Montreal and dont accept American money. NOt worth the wait, time and money!"}
{"text":"I'm not the first one you go to when it comes to a recommendation for chocolate or brownie and stuff but this place is MUST go, ordered the brownie kabob which helped me taste 5 different brownies! Super great service by Rémi!"}
{"text":"Don't even play with me on this one!  Chilly Montreal night with my partner across the table and a REAL hot chocolate between us.  Thick, rich, creamy, melted cocoa goodness.  We sat out in the middle of the sidewalk patio area where the people watching  was divine.  The service was slow or what I call \"European\" but don't go to Canada expecting New York style warp speed.  This is chill the f*^k out and enjoy something sweet in your mouth kind of place.  And so I did!

2 Montreal-cold hard nips!"}
{"text":"Great place for desserts! Great selection of different desserts for everyone, even for those who are not interested in chocolate. Wished we could have tried everything on the menu."}
{"text":"The absolute best deserts we have had in Montreal!!  This year I tried the Classic Waffles can you say delicious!!  They have English menus and accept credit cards.  They Also offer a dinner/lunch menu but I have only tried dessert!!!  The hazelnut crape is so large and the hazelnut ice cream on toP YUMMY!!  this is a must try when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Very good chocolate, and such a variety--but the place needs a good clean! The floors (and it's now only late morning) are dirty and the ledges under their huge wall-sized windows are filthy! I can't even put my bag down on it. If the public areas are this in need of attention, it makes me worry about their practices in the kitchen."}
{"text":"The place is fine. It's clean. It's got chocolate coming out the wazoo. But, it feels like a chain restaurant's manufactured experience (which it is). Everything we had was tasty, yet unremarkable (in the way that loading things with butter and sugar makes everything tasty). I'm glad we experienced the place, but will target more unique establishments with future after dinner delights."}
{"text":"We always love stopping in here when we are in Montreal. They have a wide array of desert items centered on chocolate. I really like the fondu bowls although the last time I had it, the waffles were a bit burned. 

Staff is nice and will work with you if your French is not so great. One of the few places that does not automatically go straight to English when I attempt to order in French. They have a bit of everything."}
{"text":"This place is AH-MAZING!  IF you are a diabetic you should make sure to bring an insulin drip.  There is so much chocolate and delicious items and crepes that I don't know where to begin!

The waffles are unbelievable!  I went into a sugar coma right after!  A must if you are visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"Wonderful selection of diabetes inducing treats. Opted for the mango smoothie but their menu is robust and delicious."}
{"text":"Juliette et Chocolate is really a great place for all things chocolate, as well as crepes and beverages.

The chocolate ice cream and the Fleur de Sel crepe were both delicious.

The only negative here is simple complacency. Service could be a bit better, and the place is not super clean. Other than that, you can bring your screaming kids in here (everyone else does) and have a great sweet tooth experience."}
{"text":"Quelle bonne idée d'aller manger chez Juliette et Chocolat avant d'aller se faire dorloter chez Caudalie! Faut bien se gâter une fois de temps en temps!

Mes deux collègues et moi avions rendez-vous à 19h, donc un peu pressées par le temps, nous l'avons mentionné à notre gentille serveuse, qui s'est assuré de nous accommoder parfaitement!

Pour ma part, j'ai opté pour la table d'hôte. La galette bucheronne (Galette bretonne de sarrasin avec du bacon croustillant, du chèvre crémeux, des pommes de terres grillées et du thym frais) servi avec une salade verte, une crêpe caramel fleur de sel (ou chocolat) et un thé (ou café). Vraiment, j'en ai eu pour mon argent... Non seulement c'était délicieux, mais n'ayant plus faim pour le dessert, je l'ai ramené à la maison et quand je l'ai mangé elle était imbibée du caramel... Oh my, quel délice, un vrai péché!!!!

Pas ma première.... et certainement pas ma dernière visite chez Juliette et Chocolat!"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food, as  no one ever took my order.

Was feeling hungry while shopping, so decided to pop in for a bite to eat. 

Although the large restaurant was almost empty, I was left at the front door for 5 minutes before being seated, although it was clear that the wait staff saw me.

After finally being seated, I waited for a menu. And waited and waited. Fortunately, I had a newspaper with me. After reading almost the entire newspaper, I still had not been provided with a menu, so I left and ate somewhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a freezing night with my wife for warmth and some chocolate. What we got was a fantastic dessert experience!!! I ordered the a chocolate drink \"grandma\" style of dark semi sweet chocolate that was think, rich and delicious! My wife got fondue chocolate for one which was a cup of fondue surrounded by fresh cut up fruit - apples, kiwis, pears, strawberries, pineapples, etc. and was equally delicious and definitely enough to share a bit with me as well. Service was very friendly and the atmosphere was lively and busy but didn't feel cramped.

I have three minor criticisms: one, I wish both of our chocolates came out a little warmer; two, our orders did not come out at the same time and I was almost halfway done with mine before my wife's came out; and three - Montreal is freezing at night, and yes, I get it ladies, your thin stockings you wear while going to the nearby clubs aren't doing much to warm your legs, but the line out the door gradually turned into people holding both sets of doors open in an attempt to warm themselves - thus freezing everyone else. I wish management would enforce a door closed policy.

With that said, those are obviously minor critiques and this chocolatier will otherwise offer you an otherwise incredible experience!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The smell of chocolate wafts out the door. The place has a huge seating area for a dessert place, which it needs because a line was forming at 10pm. 

What ever you order, make sure it has the cheesecake sauce. That stuff is legal heroin. One bite and you will eat anything that this sauce covers.

The service is friendly, but not swift. It is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is Gluten Free Desert Heaven!  The Trifle is the BOMB, and the caramel sauce is additive.  I also love the Citrus Salad."}
{"text":"definitely one of a kind. the la patatas is definitely a must try. service was alright, for a Saturday id expect them to be better staffed to be able to handle the influx of chocolate lovers. 

they definitely need to have one in Toronto."}
{"text":"J'ai visité Juliette & Chocolat  en soirée. C'est très dispendieux pour la portion reçu.  Je crois que cet endroit est un \"tourist trap\" le restaurant était bondé de monde, donc très bruyant en plus de la musique qui y joue. 

J ai commandé une gaufre et dès que le plat est arrivé, je l'ai refusé car elle était trop petite, la grandeur d'un Joe Louis.  La gérante est venu me voir pour m'expliquer qu'il recevait les gaufres dans ce format, il allait corriger la situation sous peu et qu'elle était au courant des réactions de plusieurs clients. Donc pour ce prix ils se servent des aliments fabriqués ailleurs est livré préparer ailleurs et prêt pour la cuisson. 

Je résume aussi la clientèle comme étant des jeunes filles qui commencent à sortir en ville seules et qui retrouvent l'extase dans ce restaurant. 

Le restaurant est quand même le seul endroit pour sortir en famille sur Saint-Laurent durant la soirée 

En somme il devrait revoir les prix et les menus."}
{"text":"Service was great, the salty crepes were great, presentation was nice and carefully crafted for each things. It's a worthy experience and of course you can't order the whole menu and spend the day eating chocolate, but you'll seriously consider it.

However I feel it's slightly hyped and pricey for what they offer. But don't worry, it's chocolate!"}
{"text":"We'd walked past a few times drunk, it looked awesome but rather expensive.  After a long talk we decided before we left we had to try a few things or else our Montreal trip wouldn't be complete:  Poutine. Schwartz. Crepes.  Old Port.   

After a disappointing plate of poutine at la belle province  (tip:  you must be SHIT FACED to enjoy that slop)  we decided to rebound with some chocolate.    the glossy, chic over priced look and sound of Juliette Et Chocolate fit the bill for the crepes.  and it was also next door.   

We had grannies peanut butter hot chocolate.  and after asking our waitress (condescending bitch btw!) what she recommended, sided with the crepe with fruit with ice cream and chocolate.  it was like 11 bucks.   the hot chocolate was more soup/spoon worthy.  A bit too peanuty and lack luster for me and the whipped cream was just from an areosol can (whipping it your self is not that hard guys... was really disappointed.  its like a pepper shaker at a fine dining restaurant.  tacky)  Buuuuut:   the over priced crepe was delicious and really surprised us.  It was enough for the two of us no doubt.  After taxes our buttholes definitely ached something fierce, but hey, at least its a town full of attractive french people fucking you."}

{"text":"I went here four years ago with two close friends. It still occasionally enters conversation and we reminisce about the desserts and chocolate milkshakes we had. I was excited to return when I came back to Montreal for a visit today, and was not disappointed. I had the raspberry chocolate mousse, and it was perfect. This places knows chocolate and keeps it very classy. A great place to impress your sweet tooth friend or upscale relatives. Also, lovely patio."}
{"text":"We got two of the warmed brownies here, and they were simply delicious! The l'intense was exactly as promised - chocolatey and intense. If it hadn't been our last day in Montreal would have definitely returned!"}
{"text":"40 min d'attente avant d'avoir une table pour 4, finalement on nous dit qu'on ouvre une section pour nous sinon nous ne serons jamais assis. 20 min pour qu'un serveur prenne notre commande et 20 min de plus pour être servi. Nous avons été pris en charge après tous les groupes qui étaient arrivés après nous. J'ai donc trouvé ça très moyen... J'avais pourtant aimé ma première visite chez eux, mais pas celle-ci. Je ne pense pas y retourner, pas tant pour cette expérience mitigée, mais parce qu'étant en transition vers un régime végétalien, mis à part le brownie végétalien, ils n'ont aucune autre alternative (pas de lait végétal pour leur chocolat chaud). Dommage."}
{"text":"J'en ai entendu parler, alors j'ai voulu m'en faire ma propre idée et j'ai choisi l'heure du goûter. 
Déjà l'accueil est chaleureux et le personnel sympathique. La prise en charge rapide et efficace. 
Concernant la carte, il y a du choix sans que l'on s'y perde non plus.
J'ai choisi un brownie, ce qu'il y a de plus simple et pourtant j'ai été ravie. 
J'y retournerai probablement pour le goûter ou un dessert après une sortie en ville cet été !"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today after having dinner near by and was not impressed. I have already been to the one on St. Laurent or in Brossard so expected big things. I was fairly disappointed. I ordered the \"youngster's bowl' ice cream which was very disappointing. I usually order a brownie when when i visit the other locations but thought i would change it up and wish i hadn't. There was more whipped cream than ice cream (above and below the ice cream). The vanilla tasted slightly freezer burnt. My friend ordered the caramel brownie and said it wasn't as good as usual. Something about watching the waitress take it out of the microwave and bring it straight to your table, kind of alleviates the charm. I think i will stick to the other locations next time."}
{"text":"Crepes... what more can be said?  The place was very busy, but the waitress was attentive and friendly.  I ordered a dark chocolate praline crepe, and the bf got dark chocolate with strawberries.  It was awesome being able to have an option for the chocolate.  When we ordered \"dark\", they asked if we wanted bitter or semisweet.  Unsure of how bitter the bitter dark would be, we both went with the semi sweet and were pleased.

The dessert they were churning out all looked amazing.  We both left the place in full-fledged chocolate comas.  Full, but satisfied.  If you are a chocolate lover, this is definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"Juliette et Chocolat, l'adresse à ne pas manquer à Montréal! Tout d'abord, moi qui suis une grande mangeuse de chocolat, d'ailleurs, je ne pourrais jamais m'en passer alors comment ne pas me rendre dans un tel endroit oú un vaste choix de desserts et de boissons à base de chocolat sont offerts et sont bien faits! 
J'ai déjà essayé plusieurs de leurs brownies et je peux vous dire qu'ils sont à tomber par terre! Je dois vraiment me retenir pour ne pas en commander un deuxième, mais bon, il faut garder la ligne! Il y a encore plein de chose que je dois essayer et rien qu' à les voir en photo ou sur la table du voisin quand on est sur place donne vraiment envie! 

J'ai également essayé les plats salés et principalement leurs crêpes de sarrasin, je n' ai rien à dire, à part que c'est un délice, et celle-ci est accompagnée d'une petite salade toute simple mais avec une bonne vinaigrette! La dernière fois que je m'y suis rendue j'ai pris celle au pesto, et ce fut un vrai plaisir gustatif, il y a avait bien du pesto (ce que je redoutais un peu au début)

Concernant l'endroit maintenant, j' aime beaucoup, il est très propre et très lumineux et c'est un grand espace, comparé à celui se situant sur la rue Saint-Denis. Et avec leurs grands comptoirs où ils exposent leurs produits, gâteaux, pralines,... Je peux vous dire que tout cela est bien tentant, moi j'évite carrément de tout regarder sinon j'achèterais bien tout! De plus, le rapport qualité-prix est excellent! 

Le personnel est sympa et souriant, ils viennent souvent nous resservir à boire, juste petit détail, vraiment petit, notre serveur avait un peu du mal avec les factures, il a fait quelques erreurs mais rien de bien grave! 

Pour les amateurs de chocolat, n'attendez plus et testez, vos papilles gustatives apprécieront grandement!"}
{"text":"I am giving this café 5 star because they have a wide range of different desserts for all different tastes who love chocolate. 

The ambiance is really cool and the staff working there is really friendly and considerate. I ordered Chocolate Fondant which was so yummy! 

I would definitely come back to this place!"}
{"text":"We came for crepes and were quite disappointed.  It was noon on Sunday morning and the place was packed but only has 2 servers working so service was pleasant but very slow.  Buckwheat crepes arrived over cooked, bordering on burnt and fillings were stingy.  The cafe au lait was warm not hot.  Prices were also high and considering the competition I would say this place relies on tourist business.  Chocolate seemed to be their thing so perhaps we should have tried that instead"}
{"text":"What attracted me to this place was the sweet aroma that wafted through the air and I knew that I definitely needed to check this place out. 

Unfortunately, the first time I came here was when it was closed. However the staff was so nice that they let us come inside and explore the food and menu. We then knew we had to come here again. 

The second time we came here was for dessert after dinner. My friend and I ordered a chocolate fondue with fruits and sweet stuff (ie. Brownies, waffles, etc.)    I definitely preferred the fruits than the the brownies because it was too sweet. 

The service was okay. We were seated and our orders were taken rather quickly. However, it almost took 30 minutes to get the chocolate fondue."}
{"text":"My order: brownie & dark chocolate raspberry mousse (yummy) 

Pros:
- Huge selection of chocolate goodies. From drinks to entrées and desserts, they have it all
- the cutest uniform. I usually don't comment on this but they pair a big red bakers hat with a black apron. Adorable! 
- they heated up our brownie ; the texture of it didn't even seem semi solid. It was pretty cool! 
- they have their desserts on display ;that helped me decide what I wanted to get! 
- free Wifi courtesy of Bell 

Cons:
- I hear that they develop a line outside (to get in) as the night draws."}
{"text":"The chocolate cake is very yummy!! Five stars for the food! the service is ok but little bit too slow, minus one star."}
{"text":"I think not.... I went a few weeks ago, ordered a hot chocolate..they brought the order about 15 minutes later, and it was warm, almost cold...I ask the waitress to replace it since I had ordered HOT chocolate and she took it back, stuck it in the microwave...and voila...\"hot\" chocolate...never, ever again...."}
{"text":"After some walking around, we stopped by for some drinks and munchies.

The restaurant is big and clean; the service was good. We were seated at a table by the window on St. Laurent so we got to people watch.

They serve everything chocolate - hot chocolates, alcoholic drinks, desserts, crepes & ice cream. 

There were 3 of us and we each wanted to order a drink and split 2 crepes. But we were told that you have to order a crepe with each alcoholic drink. I don't believe the same rule applies to non-alcoholic chocolate drinks. So we ended up splitting 2 drinks and 2 crepes amongst the 3 of us.

The choco-mojito and Irish chocolate drinks were good. The choco-mojito was kinda thick though. The Irish chocolate is chocolate milk with whiskey (served warm).

Their crepes are made from buckwheat; they were thin and light. We ordered a turkey pesto crepe which was delicious. We also ordered a dark chocolate/banana/strawberry crepe. They were out of strawberry so they substituted blackberries instead. The dark chocolate was really good, not too sweet. 

As others noted, this place is on the pricier side. Most drinks (even non-alcoholic) are above $6 dollars. You also cannot buy a drink at the counter and sit down, you must get waiter service."}
{"text":"Service is slow but warm and kind. Chocolate brownies are very tasty. Probably the best brownies that I have ever had. Hot chocolate is delicious. Will definitely visit this store again and again whenever I can!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing with the exception of the fact that there was a huge bug in my salad. Not enough wait staff. We waited a long time for service in between our meals leaving us to take most of our deserts to go. The environment was clean and neat. I would eat here again considering the set back. Staff was apologetic and friendly."}
{"text":"If you love sugary things, you will love this place. I had the sunset smoothie, it was delicious, the staff is nice and very smiley. I love their cute red hats, they look like little smurfs."}
{"text":"This is my go-to hangout spot (although my boo prefers Cacao 70).

I have a major sweet tooth so J&C always has me covered, like the most reliable dealers ever 

Their white coconut brownie, amazing, fondant au caramel to die for, brownie au caramel fleur de sel, hellooooo! I wanna go now, just talking about it 

Cute spacious interior, just love it."}
{"text":"Now lets get one thing straight- there is no question that the food here is worth every single penny they charge however the service is nothing short of disgraceful.

I can only speak on the location on St Laurent and what I experienced was enough to keep me away from there for a very long time. Staff were too busy talking to each other to take orders and clear tables. When the couple across from us asked to give their order in, the waitress told him to \"hold on\" and then rolled her eyes (this couple ended up leaving because they were so disgusted after being told to be patient 3 times)

When we got there, the restaurant had 10 people in it and it took over 20 minutes for us to submit an order. The staff look annoyed, uninterested and bothered no matter how friendly one tries to be. Getting the bill was a 45 minute ordeal and we ended up having to corner a busboy to get it. We waved someone over who dismissed us to go and chat with other coworkers. When another couple asked to speak with the manager, the waitress laughed and went and got a colleague to deal with him.

If you like chocolate and disgusting service, definitely stop by- i'm sure you'll get a full serving of both. I will be spending my money at their other locations."}
{"text":"Je suis, encore une fois, très déçue de mon expérience. Les desserts sont supposés être extraordinaires et on dirait qu'ils me laissent indifférente. Ma gaufre était OK, mais manquait de cuisson et la garniture était très ordinaire. Pour le prix, je trouve qu'il y a 100 autres places bien meilleurs !!"}
{"text":"Ah, Juliette et Chocolat, your brownies are still as delicious as I remember. Been here a bunch of times as it was one of the places I took out of town friends to when they were craving chocolate/dessert.

Place was pretty busy when I met up with a friend on a Wednesday evening. Staff is super friendly and tres mignon in their hats. Haha. 

I had a dinner to go to afterwards so we just split a brownie:
- The Banatella ($4.65) - nutella, banana and praline. We didn't taste a lot of banana but it was moist and rich in flavour. I still think my favourite is the Ivory (white chocolate and coconut).

Great place to take a date or chill out with a friend or two. Definitely a place for chocolate lovers."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of this place. It's pretty, bright and sunny, and perfect for dessert with the girls! 

Me and my friend came here to try out their crepes. My friend got the dulce de leche with pears but after a few bites, we realized they didn't put the dulce de leche and instead gave us chocolate. I asked if my friend wanted the kitchen to fix it but he was okay with it since he liked chocolate. I really wanted to try the caramel sauce though.... 

I got the fruits and melted chocolate crepe. This was soooo good. There was a lot of variety of fruits and a massive amount of it too. Portion size is definitely big.  Quality of chocolate was decent. I really enjoyed the crepe but I couldn't finish it. I also got the cafe au lait which was strong and perfect match with the crepe."}
{"text":"Squirrel crepe was AMAZING. Absolutely heavenly and pure bliss. And I don't even like crepes. And am not even crazy about hazelnut chocolate. But this crepe. was. freaking. awesome. This is the first time when I can finally understand why people love crepes! I've had crepes before, both sweet and savory, and I didn't like them at all; the texture of these crepes always repelled me - too rubbery and weird for me. But this crepe was absolutely perfect - warm, fluffy, and soft but also CRISPY, not rubbery! My sister loves hazelnut and gives this crepe 5 stars too, so yeah, you gotta get this! 

Chocolate milkshake (55% chocolate) was heavenly too. SO deep and rich, thick and syrupy. I would say it's slightly more bitter than sweet, so it's a matter of preference - just keep that in mind."}
{"text":"10 workers empty restaurants but somehow took them 15min to seat us. The waitress took forever to take our order and there 5 chefs it's taking them 30min to make our food even though there was no one"}
{"text":"This place has such a big and diversified menu in terms of desserts that I wouldn't be objective to review it only based on one visit as it would take at least 5 times to get an idea and go over the whole desert menu. It was my third time, with my last one before this week maybe 2 years ago.

So based on not only my but my friends experiences, the deserts were all good, some
of them really, and tasty, service was quick and sharp as well."}
{"text":"The clan trekked to the farmers market over at Jean Talon and after walking around, everyone got peckish.  We noticed this place serving all kinds of crepes and decided to give it a shot. 

The menu is actually very large and they serve a plethora of sweet crepes, savory crepes, salads, pastries, and drinking chocolates.  The crepes are very large and fill an entire plate.  Salads were fresh and well portioned.  Drinking chocolate was also excellent  (we got the milk chocolate tasting which let us try 3 kinds of deliciousness).  Service was friendly and good.  I would say that its pricy for crepes and salad but the quality was great so hard to complain."}
{"text":"Another location from my BEB 2013 journey!

I hate Chocolate...Im just not a dessert kind of guy...especially anything chocolate. Id rather eat a fruity type of thing as a dessert. Im one of those guys who would rather save his stomach space for the main entree than consuming something sweet and sugary.

So why am I giving a chocolate/dessert place 5 stars?

This place made me a believer and lover of chocolate! Ever had that feeling or urge of wanting to convert someone to liking a certain something? (In my case it was chocolate).

This place...geeze...where do I even begin? Let me put it this way: THIS PLACE HAS AWESOME CHOCOLATE! From the decor...to the presentation...to the creation...to the items placed in the freezer! Everything about this place was awesome! I was so against ordering something because I knew I didnt like dessert and that I didnt like chocolate. 

When the order came and I saw the presentation on the plate, my mind began be grow curious. Eventually, I had the weirdest urge and sensation and wanting to try it! So...I did. After one bite in...the doors were open and I was converted!

If your ever in the area...and have any sort of appreciation for chocolate...or if your just looking for something sweet...this place is your jam!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^"}
{"text":"Après plusieurs visites au Juliette et chocolat, force est de constater que l'endroit ne s'améliore pas .

Je dois aller avec la majorité des commentaires : le service est mauvais, pas très attentif et assez long. Un sourire est difficile à trouver. Et attendre 20 minutes avant qu'un serveur ne vienne, c'est normal ? Situation qui s'est répétée plus d'une fois. 

Également, même si les desserts sont bons, ils sont beaucoup trop chers pour la qualité des produits .

Des chaises en bois inconfortables, sur un carrelage en céramique et aucune décoration. Bref, un décor de fastfood. Dommage."}
{"text":"Best chocolate menu I've ever seen! I recently hit up Max Brenner in NYC and wasn't very much impressed  but Juliet et Chocolat delivers! Hot chocolate drinks are served in red wine glasses and they are thick and rich.  I had the chocolate fondant cake with fleur de sel caramel topping and hazelnut ice cream.  Delicious!  The cake was gooey and rich.  Definitely worth trying if you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"For chocolate lovers, but be prepared to wait (to be seated and to be served). Most dessert items are better shared to save yourself a sugar-induced coma (particularly any of the ice cream dishes). 

My low score is due to consistently poor service (at both locations) and overpriced menu. I have ordered the lemon and sugar crepe on a couple of occasions and both times there was a tiny dab of filling in the center of an otherwise dry crepe, so even the food can leave you wishing for more (although, generally, the food is the redeeming part and it is the only reason I have visited this restaurant more than once). 

It is a great concept, but it's not really worth the hassle. If you want a decadent chocolate experience, visit suite 88."}
{"text":"After having dinner at Au Pied de Cochon and not being able to get their dessert menu, we decided to get our dessert elsewhere. My friend recommended this restaurant to me so I decided to give it a try.

Right away, I love the brightness of this restaurant. It has a real Parisian feel to it. My boyfriend ordered le fleur de sel which is a salted caramel brownie and I ordered a marshmallow explosion drink.

The brownie was SO good; we still think about it back in Toronto. The drink was not as good probably because it was a mixed of dark and milk chocolate. The marshmallow is supposedly made in house but it was nothing special in my opinion. The brownie was a perfect blend of sweet and savoury. Whenever I get salt and caramel desserts, I feel that it's unbalance and some bites are too sweet or too salty. This brownie was perfect.

We need this restaurant in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Juliette is a wonderful place to bring in a group of people and have a nice conversation while enjoying decent desserts. The ambience is very modern and cute-like, and they do have free wifi. The food actually took a bit long for it to be served.

I ordered chocolate fondant with milk chocolate and vanilla ice cream. The ice cream was very rich and creamy, and the fondant was also really chocolate-y and great, but it was a bit too sweet for me. Maybe I should've gotten dark chocolate instead of milk.

I also ordered the dulce de leche crepe with pear. It was a huge portion, and the crepe was amazing. However, after each bite, it was getting to the point where I did not enjoy it as much.

I'll definitely come back here for other desserts with a few peeps! Hopefully there are better desserts than the ones I've had!"}
{"text":"Nice place to park yourself while shopping. Excellent tiramisu and coffee and free wifi. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Juliette Et Chocolate is quite an experience. You don't know if you rate it \"OMG AWESOME\" because of the amazing chocolate, or if you just walk away and punch all staff in the face because you've experienced the worst service of your life. 

What I'm trying to say, the chocolate is really good, but the service is so bad, is almost compromising. They should give more chocolate to their staff, I'm sure it would solve the problem."}
{"text":"This is a review for just the ambiance of the cafe. We only had an a hour and a half before we left back to NYC so I was still full from breakfast and time deprived.  

It's a popular chain in Montreal and just upon entrance it seems like you are walking into a French inspired cafe/bakery.  Ohh the delicious smell!  The fragrance of sweetness, i.e.,chocolates, pastries...yum!  Wish I had room in my stomach for treats that were offered here.  The interior was so lovely and roomy, staff was courteous (like all Canadians!) and I loved the decor!  Check out the my pics...Chocoholics wouldn't know which to choose first!

I'll definitely sit down and eat here next time I'm back in town."}
{"text":"For a place with chocolate in the name, it certainly delivered in quality.  We sample the fondue, some crepes, hot chocolate, and the star of the evening, a brownie with salt caramel sauce.  Truly memorable for a chocolate lover."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat this kind of food, but when traveling there is a exception. We ordered two different dishes, white chocolate fondue with brownies,waffle bits and fruit. The other was lemon meringue crepe. The fondue was just okay, but the lemon meringue crepe was just great. I liked how the inside was not over loaded with the cream and the meringue was just enough. The waiter who served us was my first bad experience with waiters in this country. They are usually very friendly and upbeat to their visitors. This guy just was not too happy to be serving us. I had to skip my tea since he never came back to check on us."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and although I was eager to try the chocolate delicacies on their menu, I started with a salad for dinner.  I had the \"agrume/citrus\" salad and it was wonderful. The portion was enormous, with grilled chicken, oranges, grapefruit and a fun crepe-based wheel of sorts on the top.  So fun and filling. 

But not to worry, I saved room for dessert (and wasn't disappointed)!!  The fleur de sel brownie was amazing.  Served warm with a caramel sauce drizzled over it, there was the perfect balance of salty and sweet.   Luckily, it was a normal sized brownie because otherwise I would have been in trouble (and eaten far too much).  

The service was great, our waitress was so nice and the food came very quickly (and the water was poured often which is so nice).  Plus, she let us sit and talk for a long time with no fuss.  Truly a wonderful (chocolately) experience."}
{"text":"Juliette & Chocolat gets 5 stars from me without hesitation. The first visit with 3 of us and we each ordered something different so we could share. My second visit was alone and I sat by the window while it rained outside and it was truly like a dream come try.

My sweet tooth has never met it's match until I indulged in the Caramel Explosion. I'm salivating now just thinking about it. We also had a chocolate crepe and a nutella crepe, both with bananas and strawberries. 

My solo trip included The Nutella Decadent and some hot chocolate. 

The prices are a bit high and they were incredibly busy our first trip, forcing us to wait for nearly 30 minutes before somebody even took our order. But we understand and were aware of what to expect. The service was fantastic regardless."}
{"text":"Delicious marshmallow hot Choc!!!  My friend & I also had the squirrel crepe...gigantic. Big enough for three people to share. This location is super close to the berri-quam subway stop"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! They have the coolest desserts that will leave you super satisfied:) and the vibe is young and classy... Filled with people at 10pm on a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"The food is below average compared to the ones in downtown. This is not a place to sit down for a quick bite of quality deserts. The wait time is exceptionally long, even when the place is half empty. Which kinda suck. The waiter are polite but slow as well. We waited 30 minutes for a glass of water and another 15 for hot chocolate."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to meet up with friends in our trip to Montreal and let's just say I was presently surprised. I was told this was a hipster place but on a Monday at 1p I'd say the crowd was averagely average. I ordered the caramel dish and when it arrived I was struck in how large it was. There was a good amount of whipped cream on top but once I reached the ice cream and caramel it was heaven. Prefect balance of all the flavors."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this popular chocolate heaven. 
Overall enjoyable time, the place is a little bit noisy on Sunday afternoon and doesn't feel very cosy, the service was good and friendly, but on a busy day you need to work to get immediate attention.
Nothing can go wrong with peanut butter, chocolate and banana crepe, where you can choose between milk, dark and less sweet chocolate.
However, the highlight of this visit is my \"alcoholic\" hot chocolate called Spicy Sunset (Le Soleil Epicé according to the French menu), which was an amazing concoction of chocolate, spices such as pepper and ginger, and Cointreau. So yummy!!!
I wish they have a hot chocolate taster option, so you can try and compare the different flavors at the same time."}
{"text":"The only drawback to having found this lovely chocolate shop is that it's so darn expensive. I barely managed to pay for my vinaigrette brownie without wincing but damn that brownie was good. I think I ate it a week after buying it and it was still perfectly moist and fudgey."}
{"text":"Pros:
Grandma style not-so-bitter hot chocolate (the best I've ever had)
Anything with chocolate

Cons:
Not much 

If you love chocolate (I don't even think I am one), this is a must visit spot. Their hot chocolates are to-die for. They are superb!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I bought the Tanzanian chocolate drink, which cost about $11 overall. It was good, but I've had just as good elsewhere for half the price. Still, the wait staff were helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I was so excited  to try this place, but, I went away disappointed. The staff had no emotions.  The crepe was so dry, and had no taste at all.  The desert was ok, nothing special.  I may give it another chance, we'll see ..."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I was here, but everyone raves about this place!

I only had the Hot Chocolate, but it was more of a semi-liquid chocolate concoction.  You have to stir it to keep it from solidifying!  

The flavor was very unique and it was delicious.  The chocolate fondue left a lot to be desired though..."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!! I've read the reviews regarding the poor service, but I've been lucky and have yet to encounter bad service at this place or the other locations. If you're a chocolate fiend, then this is your spot. It's a beautiful place, with a minimalist type decor and it's very clean. I go here for the \"grandma style\" thick, milk, hot chocolate: it's to die for!!! I've had the dark chocolate drinks as well, to which you can add spices, or fruits flavors, and the same applies: to die for!! There are lots of yummy things on the menu....such as the chocolate cake with a molten center covered in salty caramel with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side...have I said I love this place yet? Yes, it's the chocolate bomb! Their succulent products can be purchased so you can take the chocolate decadence home with you! A definite do!"}
{"text":"Fantastique! The crepes were amazing and desert was worth the calories! This is a small, friendly café where your neighbors may chat with you -- which only adds to the good vibe you get."}
{"text":"The crepes here are fantastic and well worth the wait. The wait staff is actually really good, and they better be with all the options you've got in front of you. The Hot Chocolate I had was marvelous, and the crepes were amazing. I didn't even order anything fancy and they were still amazing!

On my second visit, somebody set up us the Bombe. It was an incredible blend of both textures and flavours. I was floored.

The place is a comfy restaurant too. I'm certainly planning a trip when I'm out there in August for WorldCon."}
{"text":"Première expérience. À priori très bien. Service un peu long. Brownies très bon pour le prix."}
{"text":"The best molten chocolate cake I've ever had, I had here. Super soft cake, gooey molten center, and covered with a caramel glaze. FOODGASM!"}
{"text":"Ok you don't come here for ambiance.  You come here for something delicious!  And delicious it is.  We has the Poire Helene flambé crepe and it was unbelievable.  So glad this place is not near where I live!"}
{"text":"Un chocolat chaud à emporter (à l'ancienne, même si je ne pas eu le temps de vraiment demander la différence) tellement bon que j'avais envie de manger le gobelet en carton... Très épais, tellement chocolat, tellement gourmand.

Une part de Brownie façon tarte au sucre/pécan terriblement bon !

L'étoile en moins ça va être pour le prix, légèrement trop élevé à mon gout, histoire de faire le tatillon."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this place was really, really good. The only reason they received 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the service. Our server was fantastic and I don't blame him in the slightest for how long it took but we were there for 2.5 hours for lunch. He did tell us the food would be slow as they were busy but OYE. We had just landed and were famished! It appeared there was only 1 server and 1 cook. 

We sat outside and the ambience was awesome. Could not have asked for better weather in fall. I started with a cafe au lait, which was just ok. For my meal, I had the turkey and pesto crepe with a sunny side up egg. 5 stars for sure. Huge size and delicious. For dessert I split the squirrel with my friend. Nutella stuffed with hazelnut ice cream and homemade whipped cream. Y'all...that whipped cream...heaven. 

I would go back for sure, but not if I were in a rush."}
{"text":"I don't care what the other reviews say. This place was effing amazing. I do agree that the service wasn't the greatest, but it was all made up for in the food and drinks. That being said, it looked like our server was the only one in the entire restaurant, which is probably why it was so slow, so I'm willing to overlook it.

I've never experienced a place like this. There is chocolate everywhere. That. is. AWESOME.

We had chocolate martinis with real melted chocolate, hot chocolate (dark, milk, white) with massive homemade marshmallows and chocolate balls, crepes, and a cheesecake chocolate brownie. We literally made ourselves sick here, and it was so worth it.

If you do go here, one of the menu items that I recommend is the \"Snow White\" martini. It's a white chocolate martini with frangelico. It was delicious and cold with cinnamon on top. 

We decided to go with some savoury crepes to offset all the chocolate we were eating. I had the caprese crepe and it was just great.

All I can say is that the next time I get out to Montreal, I am going to remember this place because all I want to do is go there and stuff my face with chocolate. Yum."}
{"text":"Four stars is for the brownie only. We went in because we wanted to try a brownie, had the traditional one. We wanted to sit down and eat it but since we only wanted one brownie they didn't want us to even though the place was empty. The guy heated it up for us which was nice, brownie was amazing, especially warm, but service wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Got sucked into this place when we saw 4 star yelp reviews. Not worth your time if you value service.  We (2 of us) got there around 9:30 pm on a summer Sunday.  Not that crowded yet the service was extremely slow which was odd because there was almost a 1:1 ratio of staff to customers. People seated AFTER us were being served BEFORE us... and others were in the same boat as us. Saw one couple walk out after waiting too long.   Crepe was good but nothing special.  Had semisweet hot chocolate grandma style... that was delicious... very rich and thick.  Wish I had churros to dip in it."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a dessert. Service was terrible as sadly it is now expected everywhere we go in Canada. I can't blame it on the waitresses which were super nice but maybe they are trying to run the business with too few people. It took them 20 minutes to pour water on our glasses and another ten to take our orders. This is a small café. I ordered a fruit fondue which was ok, I have high standards for chocolate and this one was not great but not awful either. Fruit was fresh and the selection very appropriate for a chocolate fondue. Friends had crepes. Consensus was it was ok but not worth an entire hour of your day to eat there."}
{"text":"I expected so much more from J&C. Over the years i've watched this place on the rise, but it is really becoming more 'chain like' and the quality has gone down a bit. The hot chocolate we had was burnt, the dishes were over priced and the quality of chocolate is not in line with the pricing. 

It's the end of something great, but the start of something that reminds me of a could be Canadian version of the Cheesecake Factory....which really isn't a bad thing either - just a different direction."}
{"text":"Having never tried nor heard of this shop, I thought this would be a typical chocolate cafe in which their desserts do not live up to its name. If the store claims to specialize in chocolate, they better serve legit high quality chocolate and this place did just that! 

Located at the corner of Boul St-Laurent and Rue Prince Arthur O, this cafe looked extremely bright, inviting and cozy especially from the outside of a cold December night. The inside was very spacious with ample seatings for large and small groups. 

The menu offered a diverse choice of chocolate in forms of hot/cold drinks, alcoholic beverages, cakes, brownies, crepes and waffles. For the dark chocolate vintage tasting in wine glass, they offered three chocolate from around the world: Peru 65% of cocoa, Uganda 80% and Mangaro 65%. The dark chocolate was creamy, thick and extremely unique in taste. The Peru dark chocolate was the sweeter one of the three, whereas Uganda was very bitter and Mangaro carried a hint of citrus. I wasn't able to taste any hints of earth, mushrooms, mango or gingerbread as described in the menu but it certainly was an interesting and fun experience trying and comparing the taste of cocoa grown in different parts of the world. I highly recommend sharing this tasting with a larger group and asking the server for individual spoons when tasting to avoid \"contaminating\" the chocolate. *All chocolate drinks vintages are gluten free as well.

The brownie kebab was a bit of a let-down. Of the 5 different brownie flavours, I only remember peanut butter, salted caramel, classic nut and this banana flavoured one. The brownies were dry and even hard, often crumbling into pieces when I forked it. Since I'm not a brownie fan to begin with, I didn't find this dish particularly special or tasty. 

The crepe with nutella and banana was a hit though! The crepe was thin and chewy which I loved. To conclude, this chocolate shop deserves 4 stars for its ambiance, many chocolatey options and overall deliciousness! It's the perfect spot for chocolaholics and dessert lovers!"}
{"text":"OMG! The best chocolate desserts ever! Must try hot chocolate. So rich, creamy and delicious. Everything we tried here was delicious. The Chocolate Fondant was so good. Definitely high quality chocolate. The crepes are the best quality. Tried the banana and caramel.  (tried this at another shop and couldn't believe the difference) The atmosphere was warm and welcoming. The staff was helpful, friendly and happy. Totally good experience. :)"}
{"text":"I was so excited on my way over here...
I turned out that this was just another over rated place.

The crepes was okay, espresso was terrible. 

I thought that I can get some chocolate, like truffle, it turns out they serve hot chocolate.

Worse part, the decor of the place was really nice, however they need better HVAC system because I smelled like grease after sitting in the place for at least 30 minutes.

Don't feel too bad if you miss this place when you're in Montreal, QC."}
{"text":"I completely over-ordered here and didn't regret it for a second. Everything was delicious. 

The server was prompt and friendly, and she happily switched between French and English for our bilingual group. Top notch!"}
{"text":"the fleur de sel brownie was the best brownie i have ever had in my life!!!

concept is amazing, service was friendly and attentive, there were indoor and al fresco options--on a perfect part of the Saint-Denis strip to people watch--and the menu was extensive.  bonus: waitstaff spoke English fluently and didn't mind my high-school attempts at French!  the hot chocolate could have been a little richer for my tastes, but i eat like Paula Deen pre-diabetes....

the world needs more places like this!"}
{"text":"Yes this place is slightly pricey. Yes it's delicious. Yes it's worth a visit. 
I popped in for a quick take away - chocolate milkshake and a hazzlenut chocolate bomb. I downed the milkshake, not too thick not too watery. Perfect for a hot summers day. The bomb.. was too cold and bland when I first bit into it. Luckily it was so huge and I was full from the milkshake so I put it away and ate it later than night once I was back at the hotel. Ummmmmmmmmmm delicious.Pure gold in your mouth , all nice, gooey and melt-ey. I want more! The shake , the dessert and a small coffee came up to $17. 

The menu looked pretty good , might dine-in the next time I'm in town. Sip, savour and enjoy a quiet little break at the cafe. I'll also try the hot chocolate next time ( I had asked for a cold hot chocolate when I got the milkshake.)"}
{"text":"-Savory Crepe was delicious. Server had suggestions. Crepes are large and filling. 
-Server was friendly, attentive and bilingual 
-Sat on a lovely spot on the patio with a great view of the sidewalk for people watching :D 
-washroom was clean and spacious 
-will go back when in Montreal to try a dessert crepe next time"}
{"text":"Stopped in here to get off our feet and to enjoy some food that is bad for us. My wife got a Nutella Crepe and I got a cookie and Nutella milk. What can I say, it's dessert, it was pretty good. The cookie was filled with chocolate and almonds. It was soft and tasted great. The crepe had strawberries and Nutella. My wife thought the crepe was, \"pretty good, about the same as if you make it at home.\" They seem to have a lot of chocolate drinks to include hot and cold and milkshakes. Not a bad spot."}
{"text":"Yummy.  Chocolate. Nothing can be better.  Hot chocolate sooo good. Got the classic, and cute little parfaits were delicious.  A little on the busy side so a little wait, but completely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  We shared the following:

-Banatella Brownie (Banana, Nutella and Pralines) - I didn't know what to expect, I never really had a banana brownie before.  Let me just tell you, this was AMAZING.  It looked like a brownie but tasted more like \"banana bread\".  It wasn't too too sweet and the pralines added a nice texture.  

-Strawberry Banana Crepe with Vanilla Ice Cream and White Chocolate drizzle - First off, I'm not a huge white chocolate fan.  However, this crepe was to die for.  The white chocolate wasn't over bearing at all.  The combination of strawberries/banana/ice cream/white choco was mouth watering.   

-Citrus Salad - This salad was very light and refreshing. 

-Spinach, Egg, Turkey, Buckwheat Savory Crepe - The Spinach is very over powering.  I love spinach but this had a seaweed smell/taste to it."}
{"text":"I make sure I come to this place at least once when I'm in Montreal. Everything here is amazing. I tried the chocolate fondant today with chocolate sauce. 5 stars aren't enough! If I could, I'd give it more."}
{"text":"WOW this place really hits the spot for dessert lovers. The intense brownie is so rich, gooey, and perfectly balanced with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. One of the best brownie a la modes I've ever tried. If you like banana, get the banana crepe with caramel sauce and ice cream- it's out of this world. The whipped cream is also fantastic. My family was speechless while we were eating, we were so happy."}
{"text":"For our last meal of the day, my partner and I stopped by for dessert after Schwartz and were pretty disappointed. They're known for their buckwheat crepe but all the buckwheat crepe options were savory. I asked my server if the Nutella crepe can be made with buckwheat and she said yes so we got that and a mini hazelnut popsicle. 

Although there were two of us, the server only gave us one place setting so we had to ask for another set of napkins, fork and knife. The crepe is huge and definitely can be shared by two. The hazelnut popsicle is good and I'd get it again.

It was my fault for changing the dish, but the buckwheat nutella crepe was not good at all. I've had buckwheat crepe before but forgot to specify that I like the crepe softer. Theirs was very hard and bitter. Also i found out when I got the bill that she charged me extra for getting buckwheat without telling me when I ordered."}
{"text":"I am from the San Francisco Bay Area and I went to Montréal for vacation during Easter weekend. I finished dinner and looking for dessert and I found Juliette et chocolat. First I don't speak French and the waitress gave me good impression by willing to communicate with me in English. There are a lot of chocolate dishes like ice cream with chocolate and else, but their Chocolat fondue attract me the most. You may to choose different type of chocolate and fruit plate; I chose milk chocolate because I like smooth texture. Plus a latte so it cost me around $15 for all of those. Beyond my expectation, their fresh fruit dip in a very creamy smooth chocolate and I felt love from the fondue. So it is the best place to come with a significant one (although I came by myself). Because it was Easter, they served my latte with a bunny on it! That shows québécois are very serious on coffee quality and presentation. If you are a tourist, be sure to get some box of chocolate for gift because chocolate is very smooth. 

They have a variety of good chocolate dishes and are attractive, because I only have one stomach and not a lot of time spent in Montreal so I didn't have a chance to try all of them but I will come back next time.


Not to mention, it is $15 Canadian dollars so Americans may enjoy 20% off after exchange rate. At least the chocolate and experience are better than the ones in the Bay Area. Bon appetite!

{"text":"My first two experiences here have warranted a 5-star review, but my last visit brought down my rating to a 3.

The good:
The food is really good; I love chocolate and this is the perfect place for dessert or a date. Everything I've had here has been really delicious and they have cool combinations.

The bad:
The service is unbelievably slow, and they are understaffed when it comes to busy nights. The St Laurent location is REALLY loud and even more understaffed than the one on St Denis. But the real disappointment was coming here after dinner and hoping for a drink (most are above $9 and made of rich chocolate with a bit of alcohol). We were told (after waiting 20minutes for our waitress and taking all of that time to decide) that their liquor license only allowed alcohol to be served if the person that was ordering it got a \"meal\" - salad, sandwich, or crepe. I'm sorry - it is 11pm on a Friday and we're coming for dessert - why would I want to order a $10 chocolate and Bailey's with a SALAD? We were very disappointed that this rule was not mentioned anywhere on the menu or on signs and that we had never had a problem with this before during our previous visits. We were told only upon ordering by our (rude) waitress and had to pick something else on the spot.

Basically, if you have this type of liquor license (which is ludicrous for this type of place) then notify your customers or else they will leave feeling sour, which no one should do after having dessert!"}
{"text":"Appetizer - 2/5 stars.
Entrée - 2/5 stars.
Dessert - 5/5 stars.
Service - 1/5 stars.

Long story short - get dessert for takeout here, and then try and get out as fast as you can.  Service was absolutely deplorable for a party of four, taking us close to THREE HOURS from sitting down to actually paying for our meals.  I might expect that sort of wait if I was in a two- or three-Michelin star restaurant, but to wait that long in a fancy-pants ostentatious chocolate/crepe bar is completely unheard of.

The butternut squash soup I had for my appetizer was watery and as a result not very flavorful.  I like my broths to be a little bit thicker when it comes to a squash soup, and this was anything but that.  The potato-ham-cheese crepe I had for an entree was a very nice portion size (filled the whole plate), but imagine my shock when I saw sliced deli meat ham inside - are you kidding me?! Maybe I've been overly pampered by other creperies where I've had chunks of the savory meat inside, but to have deli meat inside a crepe?! Get the heck out.  If I wasn't disappointed enough from the soup, this was most definitely the coup-de-grâce of the evening.  Other than that, the buckwheat crepe itself was crisp and delicious, but the filling continued to do nothing for me the rest of the night.

On the only bright side I can find, the dessert was truly spectacular.  I had the tiramisu and it was the most coffee-flavored tiramisu I've ever had, smacking you in the face with that rich espresso flavor.  Major kudos for an excellent pastry chef, but man oh man, they've got to do something about their savory dishes.  For a place as hoity-toity as this, they should certainly be able to do better."}
{"text":"Before I visited Montreal for the first time, my co-worker from work told me about this place. He said even someone like him who doesn't like sweet will fall in love with this place! 
The location is super easy to find and the interior is cozy and relaxing. There are so many different kind of desserts on the menu to choose from! Me and my friend ordered a Chocolate Fondant, a Millefeuille in a jar, a pot of Moon tea and a pot of Green tea and peony.
The Fondant we got was served with 70% melted chocolate and hazelnut ice cream. It was warm and rich. The ice cream also taste really good. Me and my friend love it! 
The Millefeuille was super tasty too! The vanilla curd and the Bavarian cream were super nice!! This is the good choice for someone who doesn't like  dessert that is too sweet.
For the two tea we got, the green tea and peony is really nice if you are someone who like floral scent. On the other side, the moon tea was the only thing we don't like. It smells fruity, however the aftertaste of the tea reminds us of the liquid medicine we both had when we were little. Not sure why but it's a no for us. 
Overall, me and my friend really enjoy our stay at this cozy cafe. Would probably come back for more chocolate dessert since there were so many different option on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Always a good spot to get your sweets / chocolate fix. 

I tried many desserts on their menu and they were all delicious. I would definitely recommand their white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake, their dark chocolate raspberry mousse, and finally, their banana and strawberry crêpe. Oh! And if you're feeling something colder, grab a dark chocolate milkshake. It's a must. 

I also had a lunch package once, but got disappointed with the soup included that reminded me Campbell's Chunky soup. Salad and cheese crêpe were good though.

You go chocolate on this one or go home!"}
{"text":"If you are a chocolate lover and you are reading this, please note that this is the destination for you!! If you are visiting Montreal and have a sweet tooth (especially if it is for chocolate) visit this place and you wont be disappointed. 

You know how you can do wine tasting with 4-5 wines. Well J&C is so extreme that they offer chocolate tasting. Just so we are clear, they offer glasses filled with some molten chocolate that you can drink. They also offer, much in the same fasion as a wine or beer tasting, a flight of different molten chocolates. To be honest, I didn't try it but it looked awesome! 

Wait time for the food were was lengthy at around 20-25 minutes but wow, the food was good. 
On their own, my Banana boat waffles were great but the combination of caramel and bananas was just so tasty. I'm not usually too fond of caramel, but the caramel that they create here has a higher butter:sugar ratio and it was much more savoury than usual."}
{"text":"Chocolate chocolate everywhere; fondu, mounds, drinks, cakes, with ice cream, brownies ...... We didn't have any.  What we did have were buckwheat crepes which were great. There are maybe a dozen varieties, mine was with chicken, spinach and goat cheeze. Totally enjoyable and unique. It's not a \"stuff yourself\" meal but well worth going for."}
{"text":"Service was sooo slow! The first waiter didn't speak English so ordering or asking questions was difficult. Then we had a 2nd waiter and luckily he spoke English. He wasn't really good at recommendating anything so we just ordered what we thought would be good. I ordered some chocolate drink. I wasn't too happy about it. It wasn't really sweet as I was hoping for. Our time there was a bit longer because of the super slow service. They had free wi-fi which was useful. We were able to check in on Yelp and find out other places to see near the area. Maybe another location would be better to try next time in Montreal. But I think I rather search for a smaller shop for a chocolate drink."}
{"text":"Every female friend I have who has been to Montreal recommended this chocolate joint to me.  Upon arriving I didn't realize it had multiple locations, but the one on Rue Saint Laurent had a great patio and spacious seating inside.  I had a grandma's style cup of fair trade semi-sweet hot chocolate.  It was frothy, just acidic enough, and I enjoyed sipping it leisurely as though it were a lovely port or postprandial cordial.

Still, the ambience, while nice, felt chain-like and I empathized with the waitstaff for having to wear red chef's hats.  I remain loyal to Burdicks in Cambridge, but am glad we stopped at Juliette et Chocolate to experience it once."}

Le hit de sel, de sucre caramélisé du Medley de Caramel avec glace à la prlaine, en buvant du cidre, un party dans la bouche"}
{"text":"While exploring Montreal - My boyfriend and I had a sweet tooth and found this chocolate shop.

We stopped in and the service was great. We shared a peanut brownie, a scoop of ice cream, and 2 coffees. The brownie and the ice cream were delicious! The coffee was so-so, but accompanied the sweets well.

We actually stopped in the next day and bought two more brownies. One was a salted caramel brownie with a salted caramel drizzle - so rich! The other was a coconut brownie and was awesome.

Great location and decadent sweets!"}
{"text":"Last time was here, Yelp didn't cover Montreal. Now it does, so I can adequately express my love for Juliette et Chocolat. I don't drink alcohol but my friends tell me that the Mojito, etc. are very good. I had the chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream, fantastic combination. It's always crowded but we didn't have to wait more than a few minutes either time."}
{"text":"Sweet god, I had an amazing dessert here. The chocolate cake with a molten centre, covered in salted caramel with vanilla cream in a bowl on the side.

The service was lovely.

I am glad I do not live anywhere near this place, I would weigh 500 pounds."}
{"text":"Sweet Lawd Baby Jesus! I've died and gone to Chocolate Heaven!

I think we went into chocolate overindulgence overload in this place while visiting Montreal. It was too damn close to our hotel. Could not resist coming here a few times for lunch and a late night sugary snack. I think I caught the beetus here.

Heck, just the smell alone wafting out the door here is intoxicating.

Nice French inspired bakery/bistro decor. Terrific service. Super variety of items on the menu to eat and drink. Savory crepes, dessert crepes, frozen chocolate drinks, hot chocolate drinks, and so much more to put you into a chocolate coma. Forget the diet when dropping in here. Just go off on a rich chocolate feast. The menu has so many chocolate options on it you have a hard time deciding on just one. Everything we tried was prepared well.

If you are a chocolate lover this is a must visit when in the area.

Just give me an insulin shot and all will be ok!"}
{"text":"Allez-y pour les desserts surtout! 
Les brownies sont un must et les chocolats sont vraiment originaux et bons!  Je recommanderais particulièrement le chocolat au beurre d'arachide et confiture à la framboise et celui au l'orange et amande!!"}
{"text":"Juliette and Chocolate is kind of like a fancier place compared with Cacao 70. The menu is still awesome but the décor is definitely different- prettier (girls might be fans here). The place is really clean and neatly decorated, a bright and friendly atmosphere. Good place for girl meet ups.

Their crepes are big, but not thick and raw. It's thin yet big enough to cover your whole plate. Might have been a bit too thin actually. Tried the nutella, banana and strawberry; whole crepe was covered in strawberries and banana goodness. The presentation was pretty too.

Their petit pot de fleurs are pretty cute; a nice treat for someone or just to enjoy for yourself. I wouldn't recommend enjoying at the restaurant though as there are many other 'fresh' things to order. The fleur de sel and chocolate ganache was very rich, so the portion they give is pretty good.

If you want something a little fancier go to Juliette; if you're just into CHOCOLATE in general, Cacao is a must visit."}
{"text":"3.5

This is a solid dessert spot for any day of the week! It's open until 11 PM, and has such an amazing line up of chocolate-y good desserts. 

Juliette is definitely a Montreal staple for dessert, and they have 3 locations. 

The menu also includes some savoury items which I got to try as well. The menu is a whopping 19 pages long! It took me so long to decide what I wanted to get because everything looked so good! 

I finally decided on the farmhouse crepe (and substituted mushrooms instead of chicken) and the chocolate mouse sea salt petit pot, b/c how could I go to Juliette's without having something chocolatey. 

The food was prepared quite efficiently once the order was put in, but the service was a bit slow to start. I signalled to the waiter we were ready to order and he acknowledged but decided to continue to talk to his colleague for 2 minutes...a minor thing. 

The food was really good though I have to say, and I need to come back to try more. However, one surprise thing was they charged me more for substituting mushrooms without informing me. Again another minor thing. 

In all, the food and nice ambience makes up for the service which really wasn't all that bad. I'll definitely be back excited to try more!"}
{"text":"Good decor and view but not a chocolate fan. Not sure what grandma style hot chocolate is even after ordering. Girlfriend liked it though"}
{"text":"The place is kind of small so you can expect a wait if you go on a weekend.  This is a very popular spot and what's not to love?  Chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate!

I'd recommend if you want dinner (or lunch) as well go somewhere else before hand and then head to Juliette for dessert.  I find there salads and savory crepes to be ok but nothing great.  The desserts though are another story.

I usually get the brownies although the crepes are good (especially the peanut butter, chocolate and banana one).  The balsamico is worth trying.  It's a dark chocolate brownies with a raspberry-balsamic reduction.  I wasn't too sure about the balsamic part when I ordered it but I was proven very wrong when I tried it.  It was very good!  Also you can't go wrong with the intense brownie or the fleur de sel one.  I' wouldn't recommend the cheesecake brownie though as I found it too rich for my liking.

The service can be pretty good some nights and bad on others.  A few times they've forgotten to bring things that someone I was with ordered like lattes, milk, etc.  It can also be slow when it's an off night.  On other nights though it's spot on.   I'd definitely recommend going though.  It is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Our apartment was only a few minutes walk away from this cute little shop...we had just finished eating a very hearty, hearty lunch, but who said we can't make room for dessert....let alone chocolate?? :)

They have a nice variety of foods to eat but where our stomachs and eyes immediately went to on the menu was the back side....\"The Chocolate Bar.\" To put it into the easiest and simplest terms.....this page is a glorious page of an assortment of chocolate DRINKS you could indulge yourself in! If you're looking to keep your calories low for the day.....you might want to flip the menu back over...but come on, everyone needs a nice cheat day or chocolate pick-me-up once in a while! ;) 

We ordered one of the milk chocolates under The Vintage sections...and OH MY GOODNESS.....when this nice cup of chocolate arrived and that first spoonful of delectiable chocolate hit my tastebuds........I couldn't help but close my eyes in pure bliss and sigh, \"Mmmmmm!\" I was in chocolate heaven. It was simple. It was elegant. It was delicious!

I wish we would have worked out of this shop later in the day because they do have WiFi! Maybe next time :)"}
{"text":"Seems kind of touristy but I had a good meal and a fun time going here.  It gets busy and is kind of pricey for what you get, but overall i'd come back if I was in the area.

Ordered the chocolate/peanut butter/banana crepe and was pleasantly surprised by the giant square that arrived. Nothing really special about it though."}
{"text":"All I can say is this place is chocoholic heaven!  They have a menu of various hot chocolate's that would remind you of a scotch list or wine list. I know you're thinking \"hot chocolate, that's boring\".  Well, don't be so quick to judge. This hot chocolate is thick and heavenly. It was wonderful. Hot chocolate was appropriate that day. It was in the low 50s. Montreal is a cold place."}
{"text":"I have been to Montreal 3 times now and can only say that Julliette's & Chocolat is a must go to adventure. Multiple locations - we went to the one on St Laurent. Easy to spot in the corner- large sigh and patio. You can smell the sweetness from a block a way. Chocolatiers have not only mastered the sweet they have also done well with savory. This was the first stop of Montreal for my friend ( her first time in Montreal) and they didn't disappoint. We ordered brunch: I the spinach /buckwheat crepe with sunny side egg and my friend the Turkey. Be aware they do have gluten free options but their crepes are made with Buckwheat. We each tried some form of chocolate latte and then after some time of easy chatter and digestion we shared the Tiramisu. Best brunch experience ever! Can definitely purchased goods to go as they have great fondue sets. St Laurent location was large and I have been to St Denis location- small but quaint - still the same yummy smell and ambience of each!"}
{"text":"Delicious quality chocolate desserts in a trendy and inviting setting.

I've visited 2 other Juliette and Chocolat locations in Montreal which are more or less the same. They're always busy, especially in the evening, expect a line up.

I visited this Dix 30 location on a Friday evening with my cousin, had no problem being served - there were many available spots but we were seated in the same corner as all the big groups which prooved to be quite noisy...

 The menu is grand, intimidating if it's your first time. There's an assortment of hot chocolate drinks, where you can choose the percentage of cocoa, milk, cream as well as cocktail concoctions with cream liqueurs.
I ordered a white chocolate and raspberry couli smoothie as I was in the mood for something cooling in this overheated environment.

With that, I got a crepe with semi sweet dark chocolate, strawberries and bananas, fool proof choice. They let you pick the type of chocolate - a step up from other crepe places that just spread that processed nutella.

Everything is rich and decadent. I've previously tried their sundae and brownie desserts which are equally satisfying.

Wait staff was particularly attentive, she made sure to give us time and check up on us when we were eyeing the menu, came several times to refill our glasses of water and when she noticed my cousin and I were having good conversation, she did not interrupt us for the bill nor chase us out.
We spent nearly 2 hours there, chatting and catching up on lost time - unfortunately the longer we stayed, the more people starting coming in and it became very loud. Maybe not the best place to have a conversation on a friday evening, but food is delicious, I definitely understand why this place is always packed.

Only drawback is the price, for my smoothie and my crepe, walked out of there with a 15 dollar bill + tip."}
{"text":"That place has become overrated. I used to like it but the last times I went, service was painfully slow (from not getting seated to the table service), menus are dirty and there are flies flying around. BUT the food was still at a good quality/price ratio. Won't go again though..."}
{"text":"Très populaire- Great for desserts. Very popular for their coffees and pastries\desserts au chocolat in Montreal! They are known for their Belgium crepes and Chocolate. Chocolate fanatics welcome. Recommend their Rocky Mountain float.. The Good: Found on St Laurent, the Main. A Great after party or dinner get together. There is also a take out for those in a rush. You can come here cuz it stays open late Fridays to Sundays. The bad: well calories..but hey you're in chocolate heaven!! The Ugly: Gets crowded during weekends. There can be waiting times. You can't reserve, first come first serve.$$-$$$ if you're at this end in price this means you got all the expensive choices on the menu and you have a real nice problem...you're a chocoholic:)"}
{"text":"I really wish we had a Juliette et Chocolat in Toronto!
We stopped by here on what must have been one of the coldest nights of the year. It was great to see that on a night where every bar and restaurant was empty, a dessert shop such as this actually had a lineup of people waiting to be seated. 

I tried the crepes which were good, and the Peruvian hot chocolate which I found exceptional albeit a bit too pricey! I must admit that the hot chocolate menu is simply the best one I've seen so far and would have me coming back over and over to try every single item!

Overall, there is much to love and little to complain about a spacious, well lit joint serving delicious specialty hot beverages until late! I will be back."}
{"text":"Here they treat chocolate like fine wine. A perfect place for an evening with a friend or special someone. Order up a \"vintage\" of dark or milk chocolate served warm served in a wine glass... And pair it with a delicious chocolate crepe. It doesn't get better than this! A chocolate lover's dream"}
{"text":"Pour y être allé plusieurs fois, je dirais qu'on y trouve toujours notre comble niveau desserts et autres trucs sucrés mais le service est souvent lent et très peu personnalisé. Le staff est poli mais pas particulièrement accueillant et jasant! 

Lors de notre dernière visite, j'ai commandé un fondant au chocolat avec boule de crème glacée et un coulis de caramel salé. C'était décadent! Prix raisonnable pour ce dessert (certains sont un peu cher pour le format, selon moi)."}
{"text":"Before even having heard of this place, we drove by this location on Saturday night, and it was packed, we decided to give this a try ourselves the night after.  Considerably less crowded, we sat down and were almost overwhelmed by their vast selection of chocolate desserts and their chocolate drinks.  They have a wide range of milk chocolate and dark chocolate for your enjoyment, just depends on what % you want.  We ordered the small chocolate drink from Ghana, it came in the same glass cognac is typically served in.  We also got the hazelnut praline bomb, which reminded me of a ferraro rocher and the bill actually said \"rocher\".  The fleur de sel petit pot came in a cute little jar with little pieces of chocolate brownies and caramel with chocolate mousse on the bottom.  

This place is definitely for chocolate and/or dessert lovers!"}
{"text":"WOW!  The best crepe I've ever had, really fantastic chocolate... I am still dreaming of the food here."}
{"text":"Cute chocolate-themed cafe. I was looking forward to coming here on my trip to Montreal but I didn't leave very impressed. 

I got their chocolate trio bowl and Juliette & chocolat plate for fondue and it was just alright. It came with bananas, strawberries, marshmallows, waffle pieces and brownie bits. The waffle pieces were way overdone and not very edible.. The brownies didn't go well with the fondue because it was just way too sweet but everything else was fine. 

I also got the grandma's style hot chocolate in semisweet dark chocolate and it was really rich and foamy but after a couple sips it was just undrinkable- it tasted essentially like melted chocolate and it was way too thick. I do have a sweet tooth but this was too indulgent for me."}
{"text":"This is heaven on earth for chocolate lovers! You have to go here. Everything is amazing; their Ivory brownie is MUST have....so out of this world. The chocolate drinks are so thick and delicious. You also have to try their fondue. It comes with so many fruits and yummy dip........Service is hit and miss...we went there several times during our stay and got good and bad service.......but the chocolate is worth it."}
{"text":"MANDATORY VISIT!!! Omg grandma didnt make chocolate this gloriously sinful. It was overwhelming how decadent everything was. The brownie cranberries with pistaccios, mmmmmm, and the chocolate fruit smoothie oooooohhhhhhhh, and the grandma chocolate drinks, knocked us on our derriers. If u like chocolate, then this is a mandatory stop. Worth the stop and worth the calories, you may have to run a lap or two afterwards but totally worth it!!!"}
{"text":"This is where dessert dreams are made of. My boyfriend and I stopped by after dinner with a craving and we were not disappointed.

The Juliette & Chocolat fondue for two, $23, came with strawberry, banana, marshmallow, brownie, and waffle. We opted for the milk and dark chocolate blend with hazelnut +$2. 

The chocolate was incredibly rich and luscious with a nice crunch from the nuts. The dippables were solid with my favourite being the waffle bites. Portion wise: 'for two' would be perfect for 3 people.

In an attempt to balance the sweetness, we selected The Fleur de sel Petit Pot, $5 - a tasty dessert jar that would satisfy any salted caramel fan. 

Lovely dessert spot with a warm café vibe."}
{"text":"Went there a couple of times in different seasons, generally I like their food and particularly their fondue. Nice ambiance and friendly staff, price is fair overall. I strongly recommend their dark chocolate fondue since my bff licked the whole bowl after we ran out of fruits and waffle bits and brownies... just to show how good it was! Chocolate is really amazing food!"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom..I had the brownie with the scoop of vanilla ice cream and it was amazing, albiet super filling to a level such that I told myself I would not eat for 2 days (of course I didn't follow through).

My friend got the chocolate shake with the spicy pepper flavor...wasn't so spicy. I was a little surprised they had \"crepe with Nutella\" on the menu. Really? Why would anyone come here for something they can easily make and have at home?

Too much noise and too many rowdy little kids."}
{"text":"Je crois que tout est dit, mais je vais renchérir sur plusieurs points :

Juliette et Chocolat est surement l'adresse la plus touristique et incontournable de Montréal, située dans la rue la plus touristique du Quartier latin (St Denis). 
On pourrait donc s'attendre à un attrape-touriste. 

Et bien pour les prix, c'est pas loin d'être ça, mais bon, la douceur, l'excellence et la gourmandise des produits vous fait (presque) oublier la douloureuse.

Le chocolat chaud maison à la guimauve est à tomber. Le fondant est une pure merveille... bref, si le chocolat est votre péché mignon, ou au contraire si vous êtes fâchés avec, c'est ici qu'il faut venir. Juliette et Chocolat saura vous réconcilier avec les saveurs d'antant.

Pour conclure :
Réconfortant.
Gourmant.
Délicieux.
Comme quand on était petits !"}
{"text":"6 janvier 2013
Retour chez Juliette et Chocolat. La dernière fois c'était pour des chocolats au comptoir. C'était très bien, les chocolats sont extraordinaires (5 ÉTOILES) mais comme ils ont voulu allier le concept service-resto et chocolaterie-pâtisserie, ils ont oublié de maîtriser les deux côtés. La succursale est superbement décorée dans un look très actuel, nouveau-post-industriel, ouverte depuis le 7 décembre 2012, ils ne font pas sur place les confections. C'est une usine, à l'extérieur, qui prépare le tout et qui transforme le chocolat initialement pour approvisionner les boutiques. Ils préparent, sur place, seulement les produits finaux destinés au concept resto ou les confections pour la partie pâtisserie. 

J'ai pris, une galette de sarrasin savoyarde accompagnée d'une simple salade. Rien de particulier mais bon. Comme dessert, je les teste avec les profiteroles, simples pâtes à choux farcies à diverses sortes de crèmes glacées et décorées de chocolat et caramel. Très bonnes encore mais tout réside dans le service et la durée du service. Au début on se demande si c'est une question de clientèle trop abondante. Mais non. La boutique n'était pleine qu'à moitié avec un flux constant de circulation \"in vs out\". On vous demande 2 FOIS, par 2 PERSONNES DIFFÉRENTES, LA MÊME CHOSE ! Franchement ! On prend beaucoup de temps pour vous servir. C'est long 10-12 minutes pour des profiteroles !!! Je suis sorti de là après environ 1 heure. J'avais mangé une galette, une petite salade et 3 profiteroles. Oh !

C'est nettement en bas de mes attentes pour une deuxième visite. Le concept resto OBLIGE à avoir la cadence et l'organisation d'un café, sinon, on passe à côté de la cible COMPLÈTEMENT. On en sort avec 3 profiteroles à 5,99 $. La galette Savoyarde à 13,99 $ était assez impressionnante question grosseur. On est loin de la simple collation.

Conclusion : on y retourne pour le concept chocolaterie-pour emporter.

January 6th 2013
Returning at Juliette et Chocolat. Last time, I tried the chocolaterie concept at the counter. It was very nice, the chocolates were A1 (5 STARS) but they tried to link two concepts without mastering both of them. The place has been decorated in an actual look, new-post-industrial, opened since 7th of december 2012, they don't prepare the confections on site. A dedicated outside plant is doing all the work. They only distribute and re-prepare what is needed for the resto part.

I chose a buckwheat galette Savoyarde style served with a simple small salad. Nothing incredible in terms of taste. As a dessert, I test them with profiteroles, simple choux pastry stuffed with diverse ice cream flavors and decorated with caramel and chocolate. It was good but everything resides in the service of the order and its length. At first you ask yourself if it's a client number reason. No. The place was half full and the \"in and out\" ration was constant. They ask you TWICE THE SAME THING by TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE ! Come on people ! They take too long to serve you. 10-12 minutes for 3 profiteroles, it's too much !!! It took 1 hour to complete de meal which was ment to be a snack. I only ate a galette, a small salad and 3 profiteroles.

For a second visit it's subpar. The resto concept IMPLICATES a coffee place tempo otherwise you miss the shot COMPLETELY. You get out of it 3 profiteroles for 5,99 $ and a large buckwheat galette Savoyarde for 13,99 $, it's for a snack, bring your apetite.

In conclusion : return for the chocolaterie concept as takeout."}
{"text":"Great service and nice space. I had the chocolate fondant (le fondant au chocolat) with salted caramel sauce and hazelnut ice cream. It was divine. The salted caramel sauce was the best one I've ever tried. They also sell some different caramel spreads (with dark chocolate, passion fruit, vanilla, fleur de sel etc.) and they are all great. My favourites are the dark chocolate (chocolat noir) and the passion fruit (fruit de la passion). Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Long story short, everything was amazing. I'll review each item in point form.

Forest crepe
Fresh fragrant mushrooms
SO MUCH MUSHROOM
A lot of North American places over-salt (assault :P) their food but I really like this place because I can taste every ingredient.

Savoyarde crepe
Perfect balance of ingredients
It was really good. I'm not a big potato person but they made it really well

Sunshine crepe
Sundried tomatoe went perfectly
It was really good

Lumberjack crepe
This was really good but I prefer the Savoyarde (it's really similar) more

Chocolate Shooters
It was different than what I imagined lol
It was basically thick chocolate cream in a small chocolate cup

Grandma's style
It was really thick. Chocolate heaven.
If you've tried a chocolate shot before, it was like that

Fleur de sel Petit Pot
Served cold.
Personally, it was overly sweet and had too much caramel compared to the amount of chocolate inside. It was still good, but it wasn't for me.

The only thing I didn't like was that some of the dishes were chipped. Everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm! The Giandula and Lime Mousse cake was rather divine... 2 tier chocolate mousse with a subtle crunchy praline base, with a surprise lime jelly center... was so good! Not overly sweet, which was a concern with most intense chocolate-y things but this was a perfect dessert (after a full meal somewhere else!). 

Had a Cafe Au Lait - which was pretty standard, nothing to complain about there. 

They have an english menu which made things A LOT easier, and the venue we went to in Laurier was sooo soo pretty! Beautiful ambience. My total was about $11, so I wouldnt be doing this every day but definitely worth a visit if you're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"After eating smoked meat up the street, now it is time for some sweet..

My Yelp Friend knows Juliette Et Chocolat is not his place the moment he stepped in and saw the white pretty deco. And when he saw the menu, I know he rather be drinking local crafted beers in one of the brewery pubs than drinking these overpriced hot chocolate.

We shared Hazelnut Praline Petit Pot ($4.25) which I really enjoyed and Dark Semi-Sweet Classic Style ($4.99) which I hated! I find the hot chocolate was such a disappointment just overly sweet with hardly any chocolate taste! The Vintages ones does sounded better but seriously at over $10? Definitely overpriced IMO!

Service was meh, not on par with other Montreal business I been to. It took forever to take our order and our glasses stayed empty even several requests to be refilled! 

I don't think I will be back......... and I know my Yelp Friend totally agreed with me on that!"}
{"text":"Wow!
Okay I'm going to take another line to say it again....
WOW!!
What a nice place!  First of all, my girlfriend and I are certainly fans of chocolate, and so we figured we MUST go here.  She'd been here once before and had a great time, and she knew I'd love it.  ..... INDEED!
So even though this place is designed around chocolate, they have some great salads and crepes too!  The entire menu isn't chocolate.

We started with a bottle of cidre, which is typical for my girlfriend and I.  We each had a nice salad.  Hers was strawberries and goat cheese on a nice, hefty bed of mixed greens.  This was all topped with a strawberry-chocolate dressing of some sort.  Mmmm...  Mine was a mixed green salad with spinach, chicken and warm goat cheese.  What an amazing combo!  I told my girlfriend we should get a different thing every time we come, but I'll have a hard time because I\"ll want to order that amazing salad again!

For dessert, they had quite an assortment.  Half the menu or more is chocolate-something or another.  My girlfriend had a nice little peanut brownie which she said was absolutely delicious.  I had a martini which tasted like a melted chocolate raspberry bar mixed with liquor.  Truly unique and yummy!  The service was okay, though a little slow.  This was probably due to the fact that they were so busy.  We went on a Sunday night and the line was out the door (literally!)  We sat within viewing distance of the door, and noticed that the line was there during our whole meal (maybe... 1 hour 15 minutes).  What a nice place!  We WILL be back (again and again and again...)"}
{"text":"maybe because I dont like things too sweet, Not a big fan into the chocolates...decor was great"}
{"text":"We accidentally find this wonderful place when walking to get a smoke meat at Swartz . Chocolate fondue is one of the hallmark. Milk chocolate is more tasty than semi dark. It is tasty and yummy and goes well with fruits. We have to ask for more for the chocolate. The icecream bowl is good but it not come in a bowl ( as I imagine) . The portion of the icecream is good for 2 ppls. Tiramisu is so so , taste like general tiramisu. Go for chocolate fondue for this place with a nice chill out place and good service."}
{"text":"Sincèrement, je ne comprends pas l'engouement qu'il y a pour cette enseigne.

Une première fois dans la succursale du Quartier Latin, j'ai commandé une crêpe du jour aux fruits des champs... Fabuleux, lesdits fruits sortaient tout droit du congélateur. Avec mon ami, nous nous sommes aussitôt plaints au serveur qui lui-même a reconnu la contradiction entre crêpe du jour et fruits congelés. Pour accompagner, j'avais choisi un hot chocolate \"Guimauve en Folie\" tellement épais et bourratif que je n'ai pas pu terminer.

Deuxième essai plus tard dans la succursale du Plateau-Mont-Royal, j'ai opté pour un fondant au caramel... et il aurait été excellent si on ne me l'avait pas servi noyé dans la sauce caramel.

En bref, un problème évident de fraîcheur et de dosage des ingrédients, rendant le tout très approximatif.

Il n'y aura pas de troisième chance, je n'y retournerai certainement pas.

Avis initialement publié dans mon blog culinaire \"Délice ou Supplice\" (lien dans ma bio)"}
{"text":"I came here a few years ago and was excited to return after having a great experience last time. A few years ago, I ordered a crepe with dulce de leche and pears and was sad that this crepe was no longer available on the menu. I chose the sautéed bananas and salted caramel crepe with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The crepe itself was yummy but I felt that the homemade caramel sauce was a bit too sweet and not salty enough. The crepe was okay, but nothing to rave about. I will not be coming back here for a while."}
{"text":"If you need to have that chocolate craving handled, this place does it right. We came here on a Saturday night at 11pm at it was packed. Chocolate was amazing but I docked one star just because this isn't the best there is in this area and I feel like while good, it could be so much better n"}
{"text":"Juliette offers many chocolate-centric desserts which are delicious although nothing new. Where it is special is the \"single origin\" chocolate menu. Here you'll find lists of chocolates with detailed tasting notes usually reserved for fine wines, served melted in a glass to be eaten straight up by spoon. It's a decadent and cool experience, and the chocolate is damn good even if you don't taste every nuance. They also serve excellent coffees including a chocolate covered Viennese, so make sure this is on your list for dessert or a midday pick-me-up. Your girlfriend will be thrilled and you'll enjoy it too.

Recommended: Any Single Origin Chocolate, Fleur de Sel Caramel Pot"}
{"text":"Very good. I'm not that big on desserts usually, but this is something I would definitely come back for. I had a brownie with ice cream and it was hands down the best brownie I have ever had in my life. My girlfriend had a taster dish that came with four small desserts. She loved hers as well."}
{"text":"If you're not willing to sit down for a full-blown experience, but still need a mid-day pick-me-up:

Go to the side counter (\"Chocolate Bar\") and order a Grandma-style hot chocolate to take out. Hedging our bets, we ordered a Dark Semi-Sweet (how can you lose?), with the addition of a little extra milk. Intense, thick, smooth, and not overly sweet, this is just about the perfect cold-weather beverage.

For tourists, an absolute necessity. You'll need the extra calories to power up and down the Boulevard St Laurent. (Plus, the cute items in the display case up front will make good gifts for the folks back home.)"}
{"text":"If you have a sweet tooth this is probably a good place to try. They do have many location but the one on St-Denis is probably the busiest. If you ever have a meal downtown just skip desert and go to Juliette et chocolat. The price are worth it and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"Not finding any appealing dessert-specific spots in Old Montreal, my friend and I ventured into the latin district on a Wed evening for something that would satisfy our sweet tooths.  We were not disappointed.  

There was no line, we were seated outdoors on a beautiful June evening and we got our orders pretty quickly.  I ordered the banana-salted caramel-ice cream crepe, and cleaned my plate.  The crepe itself was particularly delicious, in my opinion.  One of the best crepes I've ever had- it had a wonderful flavor and texture.  

I also wanted to try their drinking chocolate, but was worried that it would keep me up since I had taken a nap not too long ago and typically try to avoid caffeine, so I opted for the extra bitter/dark shooter.  The shooter's are more like a ganache than a drinking chocolate, so it wasn't exactly the same experience, but at least I got to taste their chocolate that way and it was heavenly.

Would definitely recommend to friends and if I'm ever back in Montreal I will be sure to stop here again!"}
{"text":"best of the best a innovator this Juliet women the quality of the chocolate is amazing can't beat it all the places trying to copy is don't deserve to exist"}
{"text":"Amazing! Only reason it is not 5 stars is that it is kind of pricey for dessert, though the quality of the dessert makes the price not a bad deal. The brownies are delicious!"}
{"text":"Le chocolat, ça doit faire partit un groupe alimentaire, non?

Il n'y a pas grand chose que je ne ferais pas pour une bon chocolat, que ça soit un petit morceaux de chocolat pur à 80% cacao, un chocolat chaud à base de Nutella ou bien un brownie avec du fondant au chocolat à l'intérieur et un boule de crème à glace à côté.

Je ne suis jamais allée chez Juliette et Chocolat pour manger les repas principaux parce que, comme je l'ai mentionné plus tôt, j'aime croire que je mange toutes mes vitamines quand je prends un repas à base de cacao. Suis-je la seule à penser comme ça?

Je trouve le service très bien - les serveurs sont tous généralement de très bonne humeur (est-ce que c'est un effet de l'endorphine qui est créée quand on mange du chocolat?) et bien que le service ne soit pas toujours hyper-rapide, il est parfait pour prendre son temps et profiter des saveurs complexes des produits au cacao qu'ils suggèrent."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with beautiful crepes, that (unlike the rest of the crepes we had in Montreal) were full of gluten! Hurray gluten! So we went a little overboard and between the 5 of us split 5 crepes....Ya....Sick. we tried a plain butter and sugar, one with Nutella, the squirrel, a fruit crepe, aaaand a salty caramel....They were all fab. Can't complain. Only thing I didn't love was their mocha....Im not sure why, but mine was like straight up drinking melted chocolate, which would be great for dessert, but didn't really count as a 'drink.' I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal 2 weekends ago, and I went to Juliette et Chocolate for an early evening snack. It's a cute place and the people working there were friendly. Service was a bit lacking though, as our server was always nowhere to be found, but there was usually someone else around to find our guy.  

Now for the food: I got the strawberry crepe with chocolate and a scoop of hazelnut ice cream. It was pretty good, nothing too special. But this review isn't about the crepe - it's all about the BROWNIE.

OMG the brownie. 

I'm not big on sweets and usually don't care much for brownies. But Juliette et Chocolat is known for their chocolate and their brownies, so I decided to split one with my friend after having my crepe, and I was so glad I did. We got the intense brownie and it was amazing. It was warm and moist and oh so delicious.  Next time I would come back to try their other brownies and a hot chocolate. 

I had to give 5 stars because the brownie was so good. I didn't take into account any other factors below:

Taste: 5/5 
Service: 2/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Value for Money: 4/5
Would i come again: Yes"}
{"text":"This is for the chocolate-holics. Come here if you're craving sugar. The good thing is that their portions esp. for crepes are very generous so good for sharing."}
{"text":"A cute dessert place, but definitely overpriced and more for dessert-LOVERS. I like dessert, but I enjoy savory foods more, so I probably would not want to make a special trek here if I were back in town.

Had the chocolate and caramel fondue cakes. I would recommend getting the chocolate fondue cake with chocolate syrup and vanilla ice cream -- classic! But the cake wasn't warm. It just tasted like they pulled it out of the display case and threw the syrup on with a scoop of ice cream on the side. My friend who came before and raved about it said that it was warm the first time she came. It would have tasted way better if it was warm.

Also tried the chocolate crepe, and had a coffee. Both were unexceptional."}
{"text":"Not a huge sweets person but it was freezing outside and we craved something hot and sweet.  The place is very relaxing and perfect to just study or lounge with a side of hot chocolate.  There are lots of souvenir chocolates to buy and me and my friends liked our chocolate choices (the marshmallows were a good pairing for my hot chocolate).  

I don't have much experience with these type of dessert establishments but if you're a chocolate lover and are in the area give it a try!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast expecting to have a big crepe menu. Apparently they didn't but of course they did have a good food and drink selections of all sorts of chocolate. 

As far as atmosphere they have a nice outdoor seating area where its good to people watch. 

Food wise I had the 3 cheese crepe which was good but not full. I did not get any cheese till about 1 1/2 inch in and it wasn't that big of a crepe. Drinks I had the white chilled chocolate martini which was very very good. 

I would recommend this place for an after dinner desert or drink, not for breakfast."}
{"text":"I do love good chocolate, and they do a pretty good job at feeding my chocolate appetite on most days. I also love their outfits. Very cute place."}
{"text":"Great place to sit back and have a desert with friends. The staff is incredibly friendly and the menu will have something to please anyone. While their speciality is chocolate based deserts, they also have savoury crepes if you're looking for more of a meal than a desert.

In my opinion, the best value is the crepes. The fondue is also a good choice for sharing.

Give Juliette & Chocolat a try, it will likely become one of your favourites."}
{"text":"So my wife and I wanted some sweets.  We came here they asked if we wanted to dine in. I informed the lady we would only be getting dessert. The lady sat us and walked away.  People payed and left. Came and sat down and got drinks had the menu  explained to them. After ten plus minutes  of being ignored we decided  to leave. On the way out asked to speak with the manager.  He was the manager for the night.  Explained  what had happened  and he didn't care. He did say if I wanted to stay but I showed him they already sat my table.  I am a visitor. A tourist. I do not expect  extra treatment. Just service. I asked for a corporate  number  he refused to give it.  I am here for 3 more days and was very excited  about the menu  it looks fabulous. But if they don't want to serve you because  you will not be a regular that's a shame.  

Could have said sit here I will make it right.
Or let's get you a better seat over here and we will make the dessert  right now.  
I would have even taken here is a sugar cube but instead it was oh well post or call what ever bye."}
{"text":"Kind of gimmicky, but fun. My husband ordered Viennese coffee (he said it was perfect) and I ordered Viennese hot chocolate, which was served lukewarm! I would have complained, but the servers were so busy that I decided to suck it up. The hot chocolate itself was nice, very thick and chocolaty. I would like to go back and try some of their crepes, especially the salted caramel one."}
{"text":"Seated almost immediately. Maybe a 5 min wait. Turn over was quick. The staff was great, friendly. A PLETHORA of crepe selection for whatever your craving is. Hot chocolate had multiple levels of intensity. We ordered 1 and it was enough for 2. I love that the marshmallows were served on the side so I can add in as needed. The crepes are huge as well! Split everything and it's perfect for you and 1 other. So many choices!! Great environment and vibe."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious chocolate fondue.... Nuff' said!"}
{"text":"Delicious chocolate pots as usual! I love J&C chocolate. But I think 4.75 for little Pots of chocolate are a little excessive. I also went to do a carry out order since we were  a little rushed. I ended up waiting 15min for a girl to come ask us for our order after I had told them I was ready. Was hanging out in the counter right in front of the items I wanted to buy! All in all good food but poor service."}
{"text":"Agree with the reviews. I am in love with the place! 

My friend recommended me to this place and just looking at it from the outside it gave a sense of a great quaint ambiance. Their variations of chocolate were huge. 

We tried the Fleur de Sel Brownie since my friend recommended it. It's basically a chunky warm chocolatey packed brownie with a salted caramel drizzled over it. It sounds overbearingly sweet right? fortunately the salted caramel was slightly salty to the point that it made the combination amazing.

We also tried the fruit salad crepe which tasted devine as well. There were large amounts of fresh food and paired perfectly with drizzled white chocolate over the warm crepe. 

The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake was unique too. The pie crust had a distinct taste with a slight hint of salt which really pulled the cake together. 

Also tried the dark hot chocolate with nutella and a dark hot chocolate with vanilla ice cream. These would have been SUPER amazing on their own. But in my opinion, with our desserts it was too much chocolate overall.  Get these on their own. 

It's best to order regular milk with all the deserts so it can somewhat clean the palate from all the sugar but at the same time compliment the chocolate super well."}
{"text":"Juliette et Chocolat has good chocolate, which is expected from a chocolate restaurant, it's not cheap but hey it is good quality so I won't complain (it's not overpriced either). Their savoury dishes are not impressive though...bland salad and half empty, kinda dry crepes - still, not too bad.

The reason I am writing this review today, and why I am only giving two stars instead of three or four, is because their service is awful. I live right next to Juliette et Chocolat and my roommate is a chocoholic, so I come here about twice a month - almost a regular. Today it took us 40 minutes to get our dessert and coffee, and the waitress avoided eye contact the whole time and did not apologize a single time (oh and she also messed up my friend's order), and again made us wait another 15 for the check ( that we had already asked for). At 9 PM the restaurant is super packed, I totally get that you are running around like crazy, but at least let us know you are sorry for the waiting time.

The problem is this is far from being the first time it happens. The service is always slow, even if you go for brunch, but this year the restaurant has been obviously understaffed during dessert time (8 to 11 PM), making waiting times ridiculously long. Also their staff is very unprofessional. They need to remedy to this because it's really affecting their dining quality. 

Also, Cacao 70 on Parc has great service and just as good chocolate, so it's time to get off your high horse Juliette."}
{"text":"Tres grand local, tres spacieux, haut plafond et malgré toute la grandeur, l'endroit a un cozy feeling. I like it ! Choix varié et évidement cochon ;)"}
{"text":"Chocolate fondant is simply the best
tried a bunch of things since i went there twice in two days but stick to the fondant"}
{"text":"On y va pour le chocolat. Les repas qui y sont servis sont bons sans plus. Presque impossible d'y trouver une alternative vegan. Le resto sur St-Laurent propose le meilleur décor et service tandis que celui sur Ste-Catherine on peut laisser faire."}
{"text":"Difficile de trouver un repas vegan maise service etait excellent et l'atmosphère très agréable et pas bruyant. Et que dire du moka!!!!"}
{"text":"je ne comprends pas le hype  de cet endroit. j'y suis été plusieurs fois pour vérifier que ce n'est pas une mauvaise expérience et c'est toujours pareil.  en fait c'est pareil dans tous les Juliette et chocolat. 

Le service est extrêmement lent. Être placé même quand il y à des places peut prendre 10 minutes.  Ensuite recevoir les menu et avoir quelqu'un pour prendre la commande peut prendre facilement un bon 15 minutes entre chaque. Le meilleur service que j'ai eu à pris 45 minutes en tout entre le temps que j'ai été assis et le temps de recevoir ma commande.  ne pas oublier qu'il s'agit d'un restaurant de dessert,  les repas ne prennent pas 15 minutes a cuisiné. 

Ensuite la qualité et quantité par rapport au prix.  C'est très cher pour ce que c'est.  Je trouve que tout goute pareil et très subtile. Le chocolat est souvent en très petite quantité alors qu'il fait partie du nom et que c'est supposer être l'accent le plus marquant des plats. Mais en plus,  tout est petit. Bref ça ne vaut pas du tout sont prix. 

Si vous voulez un bon dessert,  suite 88 ou chocolat favoris sont deux endroits qui savent faire de vrai portion à prix raisonnable qui goûte vraiment bon"}
{"text":"Came here on my last day in Montreal, I really wanted to try more of their sweet desserts but we went around 11am so I ended up getting a buckwheat crepe and Viennese coffee. I got the spinach complete crepe which was very tasty, nice touch with the gruyere cheese. The Viennese coffee was amazing, yummy espresso topped with delicious whipped cream and drizzled with chocolate. My bf ordered the fondue with fruit and dark chocolate, also very good. The waiter was super nice and let us wait in the restaurant for a bit since it was raining out, we will definitely be coming back whenever we're in town!!"}
{"text":"Slowest service I have received on three continents.  Nice hot chocolate but not really worth the very long wait -- especially to pay.  Staff seems untrained and not particularly service oriented."}
{"text":"Good environment, love their crepe, not big fan of chocolate but their dessert looks all delicious to me"}
