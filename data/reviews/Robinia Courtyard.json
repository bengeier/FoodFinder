{"text":"Robinia Courtyard is great, if not a little bit magical. Some of my favorite memories from this past summer are of sitting in this courtyard, playing a boardgame with friends and drinking some delicious beer. The taproom offers a well-curated selection, and always offers some beer I've never heard of or tried.   And the food has always been fantastic! When I checked out Jardin about a month or so ago, I tried this chicken dish, and it was phenomenal!!    Black Locust has always been one of my favorite little coffee shops, and they've been hosting some awesome art openings over the last several months. In fact, it seems like there is ALWAYS something going on at Robinia! Tons of fun events to check out.  Parking can be tricky, but just use the side streets around the building. Or walk. It's frustrating when Madison gets a unique establishment like this, but people who live in a giant apartment building across the street can't be bothered to visit. It's literally right. across. the. street.  Get up off your damn couch and check it out.  I really hope this place can stay afloat until the new construction nearby is complete. Robinia really is a hidden gem, and I love it."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to rank robinia courtyard because I don't want it to get crowded! This place is just too cool. Always having varied events. I've seen several concerts and gone to a cheese raffle here! Food and beer are excellent at MadisonTap. Ambiance of robinia courtyard is very cool, with art and heaters. Definitely space for groups or good for a date."}
{"text":"I love Robinia Courtyard. Totally modern concept of having a cafe and a tap room on the same premise. The best of the day hang and the night hang. I enjoyed a lot  and probably the most at the open area in the courtyard. Even in fall, there are heaters that makes it comfortable to enjoy the beverage and food out there. It's a nice pretty courtyard with a lot of green and very modern looking.   Very friendly people around. Just a little under staff otherwise service could have sped up a little. If you are in a rush, it's probably not the best place for you. But if you don't mind, the taps and the food are worth the wait. So does all these nice seating too. I had the duck confit tacos, poutine, lamb sliders and shoshito peppers - were all top notched ! They also do private beer school which I love. And they get to have different brewers coming in every month taking over the taps. Never really get bored of the taps really. A great way to try different local beers on tap without going far off the city. This is the best of Madison in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great service, tasty drinks, and what a lovely atmosphere. This place is devine and the outdoor area is dreamy. More than just a bar!"}
{"text":"Fantastic patio for dining and/or drinking! I think I may have a new place for hanging out with friends. What a fun little garden patio! We started at the bar in The Julep and quickly moved out to the patio. The cocktails seemed to get tastier out there. (maybe it was the awesome fall weather we were having too!) We didn't grab any food, but I noticed quite a few plates walking by to other tables and they looked awesome. This is a great addition to Madison!"}
