{"text":"Great place to get a bite to eat. Fast service when getting take out."}
{"text":"Reeeally good pepperoni pizza and Italian hoagie. So happy this is right around the corner!"}
{"text":"Generally gross pizza. Made by teenagers with bad attitudes. Anything other than pepperoni pizza becomes a challenge. How do you screw up pizza? They do it here everyday"}
{"text":"So. Today I arrived to pick up my normally delivered pizza because of a special they were doing. Big mistake! Three girls were working the shop and all three were eating at the prep table, taking orders, building pizza's and never once did I see them washing their hands in between. Even saw the famous fingers through the hair deal. Oh then low and behold the delivery guy cam in and took an order from the gal at the counter and gave her pizza all the while he had a large dip in his jaw. I have finally had my fill of this place. The crust is always soggy and they cut the pizza in the weirdest way."}
{"text":"Spent $42 on wings (Cajun Ranch & Lemon Pepper) that we couldn't eat because they were OVERLY salty.  When we called to give feedback, the snarky women on the phone replied \"well, Cajun ranch are supposed to be salty!\". We threw out 46 of 50 wings.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Italian hoagie is excellent, as is their pizza.  Staff is friendly."}
