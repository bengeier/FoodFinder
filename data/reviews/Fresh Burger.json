{"text":"Best burger and fries my brother and I have had in a very long time. Not a fancy place but burgers are great. Will be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"I was disappointed..i expected more from this place. I found it to be very bland, i make better burgers at home forsure."}
{"text":"To me the best burger is fresh, simple and not too greasy. Fresh Burger just does it the best. Their beef is great quality, nicely grind and perfectly grilled. The owner, Jacques, even takes the time to drain away the grease before he puts it on the bun.   The bun is nicely toasted. Each burger is topped with cheese, fresh lettuce and fresh tomatoes, not the tired dull looking veggies which are normally seen in some other burger place. That's all you need for a good burger, nothing fancy required.   One bite into the burger, you can feel the juice coming out from the beef, which can be absorbed by the bun, and the richness of the beef is perfectly accompanied by the crispness of the lettuce and tomatoes.   The burger doesn't look big, but it's a good portion for me.   The fries are great too. I normally don't eat fries, but the ones here doesn't feel greasy and they are all crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. If you're doing take out, make sure you don't close the bag when you're carrying it home. It will be a waste if you soggy them out.   Also, they have a great choice of drinks if you're getting the combo.   You can call ahead if you don't want to wait there. They can be very busy during lunch hours.   Been here numerous times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"Fresh Burger doesn't kid. They're fresh and pretentious, and they show you out in the open. You can taste it in the patty - a subtle crunch on the outside, and so juicy on the inside...and that's from their basic cheeseburger. Their fries are so good too, not overly salty. It's like a hidden gem. I not heard about it through Yelp, I probably would have walked right by into the nearby Timmies.  They are not ridiculously priced either. $7.99 for a Cheeseburger, Fries and a Drink. Will come back fo sho'."}
{"text":"Simply fresh and delicious. They make the burgers on the spot; definitely worth the wait. Seats are limited so I would recommend getting takeout."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since it's so close to where I live. It's a small place and are currently renovating to expand. I went at night, close to 6pm, so it wasn't crazy busy but I imagine it gets busy during lunch time since there are many businesses around.   I got the fresh burger with poutine. I was pleasantly surprised to see them drain the oil from the burger before putting it on the buns. It made the edges of the patty a bit crispy which was nice. I wish I opted to change the [processed] cheese topping to something better though. The poutine was really good, not too salty, and they give you a decent portion.   Better than settling for a McDonald's run. You can also order online from their website for a quick pick-up."}
{"text":"Best burger and poutine in the GTA! Fairly simple menu but the food is delicious! You can see them cooking and preparing their burgers with fresh ingredients, so you don't have to worry about what goes into ur food. Although the food is a bit pricey, trust me, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Out of ALL my burger hunting escapade province wide I have finally found my resting spot. Hands down simply the best burger I have ever had. The flavour of the meat, the consistency and the overall burger eating experience can only be defined as Fresh Burger."}
{"text":"Great tasting burger. Yelp led me to this burger joint. Burger melts in ur mouth and the fries are filling. You can pre order your burger before 1130 because this place is packed at noon"}
{"text":"Opted for the standard 4oz Fresh Burger and fries combo. Although the patty itself was good, I would have enjoyed a few more free toppings. You do get all the traditional items (cheese, tomato, lettuce and their own special sauce - plus a choice of optional onions or pickles, if you fancy them) as a base, the premium toppings will run you a $1.00 per topping. So your burger tab can add up pretty quickly. Fries were great and I suggest trying the gravy, it's equally delicious. Wish they had onion rings as a side but can't fault them for that. It definitely lives up to its name \"Fresh\" as the burger was made from scratch in front of us. Kids loved it! We will be back with the family again."}
{"text":"Getting progressively worse, won't be back. Food sat around right in front of us, nobody called our number to say our order was ready!  Order online for pickup a total waste of time!     - site would not accept my credit card (triple checked) info when setting up acct. spent so much time putting my 6(six) burger combos order in and had to abort my acct. What a waste of time.Had to call in my order.   - site doesn't let you modify your order once you add to cart.either.  Once I called in my order in, employee said we're not busy come in 10 min. Took 15 min to get there and still had to wait another 15 min. That's not even the worst part. We saw an employee packaging a bunch of food in plastic bags and just left on counter. Our food just sat there getting cold for 5 or more minutes. We didn't know it was our order, no one called our number. Was wondering to myself, is that our order, maybe not complete and was waiting for another item, or was the next person's order. We had to ask for our order, and it was just sitting there the whole time. No one had the courtesy to asked us which order we are waiting for. No apology, is like our fault for not getting our food.  On top of that one of our burgers was PINK, undercooked !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing burger place!! Honestly I can't tell the difference between the regular fresh burger and the prime version, they're both so delicious to me! Their burgers are super fresh just like their name - buns are crispy on the outside but soft oh the inside, patties aren't drenched in oil and make the whole bun soggy, lettuces are fresh and crispy, and oh boy their burger sauce is amazing. Very friendly staff and is always very clean inside. Remember to pay extra to get their hamburger sauce on the side - they're heavenly as fries dip and extra burger sauce!!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever eaten.  They cook their burgers like at Harvey's but way better"}
{"text":"My first time at this burger joint. I will be rating this plsce according to the service,  atmosphere and food.  Service 4/5: the perople working there were all very friendly and nice. They were helpful with our order.   Atmosphere 3/5: nothing special typical burger joint. I found the tables and chairs were a little dirty and also most of the tables were wobbly. I had to wipe  of the table and chair before sitting at the table.  Food 3/5: again these rating  are for my liking. My friend and i ordered two prime single burger combos. She had regular fries and i poutined mine. In my opinion the burger was way too oily and made me feel a little sick after eating it. I couldn't finish my burger and my friend had to eat it for me. She found it a little oily but she was okay with it. Also with the burger i didnt taste their sauce at all. I am kind of sure they missed that. The poutine in my opinion wasn't that great the gravy wasnt hot enough so the cheese curds did not melt. I barely ate the poutine because the burger just made me feel a little unsettling.  The fries were good.   All in all i would give this place a 3.5 star."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of the best burger place in Trono you pay 10 bucks so the price is great you get home cut fries and a amazing burger with cheese on it and a can of pop and the started selling beer......"}
{"text":"great flavours and meat quality.  We tried the fresh burger, mushroom melt, and bacon cheeseburger.  mind you, all their burgers have cheese included. You could probably switch it out for another topping, I didn't ask. Upgraded one of the fresh cut fries to poutine. Fries were hot, crispy, and well sized. Dare I say better than Smokes? I just did.  An array of condiments to add to your fries, including... clubhouse (tm) CAJUN!  Definitely coming back to try the prime burger."}
{"text":"Got the special which was the mushroom melt burger for that month.  Beef patties were excellent, not too thin.  Bread was perfect.  Only down side was the service was a little slow, so if you're looking for something quick, it'll probably take about 15 minute to get your order.  Will visit again in the future.  Nice mom and pop restaurant."}
{"text":"Working at the airport down the street, all of us frequent this place quite often. Great service, food is delicious, fair price for fresh food."}
{"text":"Burger is delicious and fresh. Poutine is good and not salty.  Nice to have this quality without going downtown"}
{"text":"Compare to other burger places in the neighborhood:  Five Guys, Harvey's, Hero etc.    I will rank this place equal to Hero.  But they really need to season the beef some more, I believe them when they say 100% real beef with no fillers.    Fries taste like was deep fried twice (left over from the previous day)."}
{"text":"Coming here for the first time with friends, and so far it is pretty awesome, the smell of the burgers on the grill already capture your attention. Now, the actual meal: there are variety of drinks (well it is mostly pop and water bottles and one type of orange juice). The burger, taste pretty good, the burger crust is crispy, but I feel like the burger is well done, other than that it is still consider juicy. Just a heads up, if you like bacon, caramelized onion, etc.... Those are extra. Pickles and regular onion are free but you need to tell them to put it on your burger. Finally the fries, I got the California upgrade for it (it's not on the menu, but if you tell the cashier, they know what to do). Just a friendly advice, it is messy but it has a special sauce (taste like Big Mac sauce) and with caramelized onions. It taste pretty good, it's sweet.  Overall, this is a pretty good burger joint, you order and wait to pick up and enjoy. There are not lots of space at the joint so if you are coming with a bunch of people, be warned, you might not have enough space. Staffs there are alright, not overly friendly but not rude at all."}
{"text":"Best burgers we ever had. So juicy. It is unreal. When my 3 young boys said that this was the best burger they ever had, well...it says it all. Quick service. Low price. Friendly settings. The owner Jacques is always there - this guy cares about his business.  Well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"You really cant get a good burger unless you go downtown. Ive heard and read many good reviews on fresh burger but finally had to try it for myself. First off, the staff was friendly and passionate about their burgers. Their menu is small, which I didn't mind, just burgers and fries. I had the 4oz burger combo with fries and a can of coke for 8.85+tax= $10 , and here's my complaint the price is way too much for its portion. The burger was average,a bit small, couldn't really taste the meat, a bit oily, the meat was very crumbly, I like a more solid texture. The fries were good but nothing special, a more reasonable price would be $8.50 flat. Overall this place is too expensive"}
{"text":"Simple, fresh, delicious.  Had the Freshburger.  All burgers come with sauce (kind of like a Big Mc sauce), tomato, lettuce, cheese.    Only thing for me was it was missing pickles, so I had it to go and added my own pickles at home.  They didn't salt my fries which is to my liking."}
{"text":"I'm undecided about this place now. Their burgers taste very good as always, but I feel the value continues to decline. Recently, they have increased their prices even more. $10 now only gets you a VERY VERY small burger combo, 4oz to be exact. That's significantly smaller than a simular McDonald's burger that you can get off the $1.39 menu. I know this is a better burger of course, but even at their old pricing the value was debatable. In this area there is not much to choose from, so people may continue to pay it. But at the new locations opening in Toronto where people have much better alternatives such as Burger priest or the works, this might not go over as well."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with it...  Just nothing special about it. There are far better burgers to be had in Toronto"}
{"text":"Very tasty. Made fresh right in front of you. A little pricey, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"As a huge burger fan, I was excited when reviews started pouring in for this place and right around the corner from our house!    I'm happy to say that it definitely fulfilled the hype.  The burger was delicious and tasted really good.  I would rate it slightly below Holy Chuck, almost on par with Burger Priest.  Better than five guys and much better than anything else in the neighborhood.    The fries were just soso though, not bad, but not standout either.  I will definitely be returning again and again!"}
{"text":"Best burger in the city-- dare I say the world? My go to burger spot, the burgers are perfect everytime. I always get the double fresh burger-- it is a good size and somehow much more flavorful than the single patty fresh burger- I attribute that to the way the two patties make love in between the buns. Poutine is delicious. Fries portion is very large. Service always friendly and quick."}
{"text":"i like this place. for a place that has tiny signs at the side of the road advertising their combo (it made me suspicious it would be of low quality) - BUT I WAS WRONG!!  i walked in and was greeted by the site of someone putting balls of red ground meat onto the grill. i was impressed right away. i then noticed they flattened them out. once. because thats what is supposed to happen!  they will dress the burger in a certain way unless you tell them you want it a special way. it comes with special sauce, tomato, pickles, onions. dont hold the burger over your pants like i did - my pants looked like i got way too 'happy'. if you want something else tell them.  the fries were... meh. they advertise freshly cut/peeled fries - but the flavor wasn't leaping out at me the way they do at other fresh cut fry places. I had the poutine and it really didn't seem worth the 3 bucks extra BUT they use REAL CURDS (i mention this because its a big deal for some people)  at 7.99 for a good fresh burger, fresh cut fries and a can of soda? good deal. and i'm coming back for more.  they have both coke and pepsi here. ooooo controversy. not sure why i mentioned that but I like that they're both here (although kept on different shelves :)"}
{"text":"Yumm. I was craving burger priest or holy chuck but was not about to drive forty minutes to get some. I was tired of the terrible chain restaurants in my area so I searched yelp for something new to try. I came across fresh burger and raced there without a moment to spare!   I just had this and it is definitely up there with the big dogs of Toronto burgers. I had the double freshburger combo and it didn't disappoint. The meat is excellent, tender, juicy cooked perfectly (no raw centre). I like that it's juicy but not so greasy that your hands are covered in oil. It's definitely the star of the show as the accompanying toppings are just typical.   One thing I will say however, is I wasn't a fan of the bun. It's soft, but tastes very run of the mill, local grocery storeish. But the meat and cheese was so good I didn't really notice much after the juices got to it. I would say they need to improve that. The fries were also just typical. Crispy? Yes! but also kind of hard. But maybe that's just because I came near closing  They also apparently have a \"special sauce\" on the burger. At first I didn't really taste it but later I found that it accompanied the burger very well. It was subtle but appreciated so that's a plus.    I probably came in at 7:50 (closes at 8)  and I could tell the guy at cash wasn't pleased. He immediately came behind me and put up the \"closed\" sign before he took my order. It seemed like it was one of those days for him so I understand but I was the last one so at least fake it for one more customer!   Anyway all in all I say this is a fantastic burger joint. I'll definitely be coming back since its only 20 minutes from my house.  Not quite as good as my two favs but definitely extremely close. They're well on their way!"}
{"text":"Overall: 5 stars  Parking: Ample parking shared between a few restaurants and professional offices.   Service: Mostly good. Sometimes they get really busy, but it's worth the wait for fresh food.   Food: Their 4oz Fresh Burger is juicy, flavourful and I like their special sauce. It's usually enough to fill me, but when I'm hungry I need the 8oz Double Fresh Burger. If you like onions and pickles, totally add them into the mix.   Oh man, their fries are actually great as well, and always fresh. Just a bit of Cajun or seasoning with ketchup is enough, but their poutine is also delicious! They recently expanded the restaurant and it seats many more than before :)  Comparisons: This is my favourite burger at the moment. For me it's on the same level as Shake Shack down in the US. If I have the time to come here why would I bother settling for Hero Burger?  Impressions: I'm a regular here and unless things change drastically, I'll continue to come."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints ive been to. The prime rib burger is delicious. It tastes very similar to in and out."}
{"text":"They are fresh burgers! Poutine had a good amount of cheese, but overall too much to finish for lunchtime.  Next time will likely just go with combo 1 or just the burger. Feb 2016 - Work lunch Freshburger 4oz - $5.59 - Charged $1 extra for Sauteed Jalapenos  Poutine (shared) - $5.99  http://www.fresh-burger.com/menu/"}
{"text":"Good burgers, great prices. Not the best flavour though. A bit bland but it hits the spot if u want a burger. I like that it's made fresh though. Def tastes fresh."}
{"text":"The burgers are juicy and delicious however they're quite small. I ordered the 4oz fresh burger and the burger came smaller than I expected. However with the price of 5.49$ a burger it's a good deal. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you like a fresh juicy burger. However, it does take a while for them to cook the burger so if you're In a rush for something quick this won't be a good spot."}
{"text":"Love the burgers and fries here. Parking is sometimes a bit tricky but I work close enough that I can walk in the nice weather. Service is generally good but it does get busy at lunch."}
{"text":"Found this place from a street sign saying they made their burger fresh daily.  So we drop in to check this place out.  And indeed just like their name \"Fresh Burger\" it serves up juicy burger with fresh slice of tomato, lettuce, and Onion. I am not a big burger fan, but this place makes me think that wow.. I can come back for more next time if I need a burger fix.    Their menu is simple, just burger and poutine.  Honestly I thought their gravy was a bit weak, but their beef patty is super juicy.    Their prices are decent, i think for this quality in comparison to McD or Hero Burger around the corner, i would rather come here.  Here are what some items i remember off from their menu with prices.  Cheeseburger combo comes with fries and a pop for $7.99 Double cheeseburger combo with fries and a pop (sorry cant remember how much) Cheeseburger itself $4.99 Poutine $5.99 You can upgrade the fries to a poutine for extra $3.    Burger super juicy. So if you got a burger craving, consider this place.  I would definately come back again."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about this place, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Best straight up burgers in town and fair pricing. Not much else to be said, if I'm getting a burger in RH it's always here."}
{"text":"burger was very typical. near a mcdonald plaza, i would rather pay mcdonalds instead. was very normal. didn't feel like i'm eating a \"in-house\" made patty. wished they had more sauce or toppings."}
{"text":"I go here often. Good burgers and good fries. Staff is friendly. Poutine is really good too. They sell their sauce on the side, but without the burger it's nothing special. It's super cheap so check it out you may like it. Will be returning again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The burger was moist, flavourful and tasty, the balance of toppings was just right, and the fries were chunky, with a crispy outside and light, fluffy inside. The server was pleasant, professional and quick, and the restaurant was clean and well-maintained. And the quality was a good value for the price.  I've tried several burger places that were disappointing; this one lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Got it the first time as take out and the burger was so juicy and cooked perfectly. The fries were also great, very thick fries and they give you a lot of fries! Went back the second time to have it in the restaurant. Very quick service even with a decent amount of people inside and tried their poutine this time too! The poutine was average, nothing great but nothing bad about it. Definitely one of the best burger places in Richmond Hill & can't wait for their expansion to their current place."}
{"text":"Awesomely fresh and fabulous owners.  For two bucks you can buy a homeless person a meal.   Make sure you take the special sauce."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place. Really affordable, at $10/combo. I can't get over how amazing their french fries are! The burgers are tasty and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great burgers.  I will go for the 6oz next time. Not a fan of the fries though. I will pass on the combo next time."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I would compare it to other \"gourmet burger\" joints it lacks the marketing/design finesse that the others offer. With combo options printed on a large foam core board, it's more of a ma & pa burger joint. But who cares about decor if the food is awesome right?  That's the thing... Combo #1 which is a 4oz burger, a can of pop and fries, for a total of $10 which is a great price now-a-days! I mean you can go to McDonald's and a combo will cost more than that! So price is reasonable. The actual meat patty in the burger delicious! Could they have squeezed a little more oil out of it before it went into the (I didn't really like it, un-toasted) bun, yes, and they probably should have. If you just get a regular burger and don't upgrade your cheese from the processed cheese for the extra dollar, or if you don't add additional toppings then I wouldn't write home about it. If you do upgrade then it's well worth the wait, but your bill does increase once you do all that... The amount of fries you're given is overwhelming and for food that always a plus! So, all in all it's an ok place, but if you're going for lunch get there early because you won't get a seat while you wait for your number to be called."}
{"text":"It is kinda tiring driving to Burgers Priest and Real Mccoy for my burger fix.   I try most new burger places in the area, so wasn't too optimistic when Fresh Burger opened a month or so ago.   It was so great seeing such a simple menu.  Burger and fries.  Option for poutine.  Perfect.  And super reasonable prices.  $7.99 for the combo - are you sure?  For frozen I can see it, but for fresh daily ground sirloin burgers and fresh cut fries - that sounds too cheap!?  But that just makes it an easy decision to add bacon and fried onion! As good as the best of the Toronto burgers - and at a better price.  And right here in my neighborhood.  My kids already starting doing the fresh burger chant in the car when we are deciding where to go for dinner.   I've gone with coworkers and been a little nervous seeing the line up almost out the door, but it is worth the wait.  I'm almost embarrassed to say that I have been back 3 times already."}
{"text":"The suburbs finally have a proper burger joint!  If you are obsessed with Burgers Priest, but you live in York Region this is the place for you.  The burgers are perfectly griddled and the meet is clearly incredibly fresh.  The buns are soft and their secret sauce is amazing.    This place is a must stop for burger lovers!"}
{"text":"Great caramelization on the meat... Juicy... Good flavour... A bit pricey but soo delicious.  Fries are double fried in Peanut oil.. Also tasty"}
{"text":"Just finished my burger combo here with my partner. Was an even $20 for both combos. Tasted juicy and fries were done properly.  Service was quick and friendly. It's too bad this place is not busier but I believe they have only been opened a few months. Would be great if they were opened later at least on the weekends. Over all nothing to complain about and will be back for more."}
{"text":"Good good. Bombardier and Westjet sure combine for a solid burger.  Its priced right, the quality and freshness are immediately evident, and the food comes quick.  There is a very good business model here with only 5 or 6 items on the menu, and being that the owner is from Montreal, the poutine has the real deal curds.     I can see myself eating here regularly."}
{"text":"Just absolutely delicious! We tried the 4 oz fresh burger with all the toppings and it was perfect. The poutine was also delicious. We will be returning soon! Yum!!"}
{"text":"The name says it all.  Fresh Burger is a must try if you're hankering for a great tasting burger reminiscent of years gone by. Excellent fries with potatoes sourced locally and peeled right on the premises - you can't possibly get fresher than that. The store is kept 'spic and span' clean and is an ideal place to bring kids. Plenty of parking, reasonable prices and consistently friendly service are always appreciated."}
{"text":"The burgers are fabulous ... However Fresh Burger in Downtown Toronto has a few problems: 1) Be careful with the French fries ...as you may well find yourself chewing on a piece of plastic wrap straight from the deep fryer. This has happened to me on several occasions and once when I was with my youngest Godchild, who choked on a piece of plastic in his fries requiring rescue to stop him choking.  Another time we found large chunks of potatoes in the fries which were inedible. 2). Sadly, staff members at the Church Street location never seem to smile ...and generally appear to be upset and unfriendly towards the customer - which is most unfortunate when they are the face of the company and should be providing good customer service.  I now send others to pick up my orders and have given up on the fries."}
{"text":"The newly opened Church and Wellesley location replaced the old Acme Burger. The interior is spacious, with ample number of booths with lots of sunlight shining in. I loved seeing the sack of potatoes at the front of the restaurant which are used for the fresh cut fries.  For a simple good quality burger, Fresh Burger provides a tasty bite at very reasonable prices. A customer can get a combo for less than $10. Many restaurants charge $10 + dollars just for a burger.   I ordered the 4 oz fresh burger, topped with cheese, tomato and freshburger sauce and added caramelized onions and sauteed jalapenos, and shared a poutine with my friend.  The burgers were as juicy as the first time I had it in Richmond Hill and consistently stayed true to itself. The focus is on the taste of the freshly ground 100% lean Canadian AAA Sirloin that is grounded fresh daily."}
{"text":"Fries were hard, re cooked and tasteless, burger was a moist mess. The canned Dr Pepper was good."}
{"text":"Best burger in Richmond hill hands down. Wish they had onion rings and more room to sit. Only gave it 4 stars because they close so damn early."}
{"text":"Top of the line Burger! So much better than other \" hand crafted burger\"  places, hands down any day make sure to ask them about their succulent poutine! One of a kind!"}
{"text":"Best burger in the GTA hands down. Been there a million times and still haven't left a review until now. Burger priest, holy chuck, move over. Fresh burgers food and prices kill those places. Top shelf in every way. 10/10"}
{"text":"I just happened to have a huge craving for a freshly made burger and since I did not want to go to the big chain fast food joints, I searched my options on yelp and came across Fresh Burger. Since there were so many good reviews, I actually decided to drive out of my way to try this place out.  I ordered the 4oz hamburger, fries, and drink combo. I was so excited to fulfill my craving with what was supposed to be an excellent burger and fresh, crispy cut fries according to the other reviews here.. Boy, I was DISAPPOINTED!!!!  First of all, the burger- which I ordered with all the toppings (lettuce, tomato, cheese, onion, pickle, homemade sauce). When I opened the bun to add some mustard to my burger, I saw that the toppings were so SCANT. There was exactly one very small piece of lettuce hardly big enough to cover the patty, one and a half pieces of pickle, a dab of the homemade sauce which tasted like a mock of Big Mac sauce, and the onions... Oh man, it was a joke. The onion pieces looked like some leftover pieces and they were so small that I could not even TASTE them!! If you're going to mock your customers this way and put in a couple of shrewd pieces of veggies as \"toppings\", just don't offer them or make them right!! Honestly, it would be better off eating the burger without those scant toppings that really left a cheap image to the business. Even though the most ingredient of a burger is the beef patty itself, it's the other toppings that really enhance and compliment the whole taste. If I just wanted to taste the beef, I might as well as just eat a piece of steak or something. By the way, even the beef patty itself was rather bland, nothing really extraordinary compared to other popular freshly grilled burger joints.  Next are the fries, which I thought would be the last saving grace.. WRONG. They were not golden fried and crispy at all- rather, oil saturated and limp. Yup, LIMP. It was so oily and the limp texture making me frown every time I chew that I just ended up throwing away the whole batch away. What a waste of money...  You may think that I'm overreacting with this whole burger experience, but with all honesty, I really wanted to like this place so that I can satisfy my occasional burger craving here rather than going to McDonald's and other fast food joints. But this whole experience really left me disappointed.   I would be more sympathetic and understanding of the whole scant topping issue and limp, oily fries if the place was packed and busy, and the employees couldn't exactly keep up with the consistent quality control. I tell you, there were exactly only THREE other customers than myself when I was there- two customers already almost done eating and one customer waiting for her order. So what is the excuse for this disappointing quality of food? There should be NO excuse. If it's the employee's fault, then the owner better keep his/her eyes open with quality maintenance and train the employees well because your good reviews so far will be replaced with bad reviews like mine."}
{"text":"Very juicy patties. Had the double primeburger with poutine. Fries are good as well. I liked the way the burgers are wrapped, which made it less messy. The price was also reasonable given the quality of the burgers."}
{"text":"Whoever that last reviewer is named \"Derek C\" , I have to say, while his review is good, he looks as delicious as the burgers themselves. I can't wait to bite into one."}

{"text":"DELICIOUS   I absolutely love this place and go for take out every once in a while. I usually get the prime burger combo and it is able to fill me up. Their food is cooked to order and their beef is delicious(real beefy taste). I also love their handout fries.     Give it a try if you're in the area, definitely worth it.  Happy yelping!!"}
{"text":"Place is bomb! One of the rare times that I visit a place highly reviewed and felt it deserved it. Burger just melts in ur mouth. Juicy, tender, flavorful. Buns were perfect too. I did the simple, no extra added toppings.   The ratings for poutine were spot on - a little over on the salty side. It was ok.   Although not big, the burger did fill me up tho. Couldn't finish the poutine, saving it for later. And I'm a grown man who can eat.   Ps place is super clean too."}
{"text":"I'm sorry! We decided to get combo #1 and #3. We waited about 25 minutes for our order??  ( and it wasn't even that busy)  this PAINS me to leave a scathing review! This is not what I like to do.   I am well known to let things fall off my back when it comes to food.   The fries were terribly salty. Omg! Just horrible! The Burgers were SO BAD.. I purchased the ( thicker 6 oz burger) and it was the same size as my partners 4 oz burger. I usually am one to eat ANYTHING. I'm the pig of all pigs that loves food!! What the hell??   This burger was the most tasteless thin dried burger ( if you call it that). I thought maybe I was wrong and picked off the patty (to make sure I was wrong) just tasteless!   I provided photos to prove I was throwing it away, and I didn't eat all of it! I didn't want to be a person to rant and not prove it!   They should be ashamed of themselves! The $24 I lost.  If the service was ok.. and the food ok. I would let this go.   Worst part of my Toronto visit."}
{"text":"When I first arrived I wouldn't have expected myself to ever come in if I was just passing by but after a recommendation from my friend I gave this place a try. Upon walking in, it was very open with a lot of place to sit. Everything was freshly made and the wait was short to get our food. Everything tasted fresh, from the beef to the veggies to the fries. I also had the poutine where I could taste the fresh fries and real cheese curds. The only complaint I had was there was a lack of variety for a burger place. It only had beef burgers and did not cater to vegetarian or chicken burger options."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices . It's a great place for a hot fresh lunch. Poutine was really good . Maybe a little salty but I am sure you could ask them not to salt the fries as much.  Wish we had a location closer to where we live.  Thanks again for a great lunch"}
{"text":"Burgers and fries, and nothing else.   They do a good burger but no topping selections, every burger comes with cheese,  lettuce, tomatoes, and sauce. $7.99 for their Fresh burger combo that comes with fries and a can of pop. You can add bacon or mushrooms for $1.  Decent burger, decent price.  Very busy at lunch."}
{"text":"Wow, exceptional burgers here. Simple no bullshit menu with choice of single or double patty burgers. Quality beef and fries made fresh in front of you. Poutine tasted great as well. Not too salty and the cheese actually melts!  Great high quality burger place that can you access uptown without having to trek downtown."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a while! The patty was juicy and had a soft, kind of crumbly texture (in a good way!) and was super delicious. Only gripe was really the fries. My friend and I got both the regular and the upgraded poutine with our combos. The gravy and cheese curds on the poutine was good, but the fries itself were kind of mushy. Looks like they pre-fry it before serving. Unfortunately, I'll only be back for the burgers and probably will skip out on the fries."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch last week with a few colleagues. This place was crazy busy and once my colleagues and I filled up six seats, there were a few customers coming in who had to wait for tables.   This place is also loud and you might have to repeat your order. The guy taking my order didn't hear me ask for pickles so I didn't get any on my burger, which was a shame.   The burger patty is smashed onto the griddle so they get an amazing char on their patties. I ordered the Prime burger which is supposed to be 6 ounces. I honestly didn't notice much difference between the thickness of my patty and my colleague's 4 ounce Fresh burger. Perhaps it was wider in circumference? I don't know.  They do smash down these patties to quite a thin size, so there isn't much chance to retain a lot of juiciness, but this patty was in no way dry. It was good and flavourful, thin and well-charred. The bun and toppings (save the missing pickles) were all good.  The fries were decent. Crispy and golden. Nicely seasoned."}
{"text":"BEST BURGERS Let's just say, this is the best burger joint I've ever tried. Nothing beats how tasty, fresh, non-greasy, non-oily, the burger and fries are.   Their stuffings are the same (I believe) for all their burgers. Very easy menu to follow and it tastes so damn good.   You know that their meat is freshly hand made. Not frozen and flat like other burger joints. The meat is moist and tender and filled with flavour. The bun itself wasn't even oily. Fries too, you can barely see any oil leaking through the bags. Incredible!  You won't feel sick after having this burger. You'd want to have another one.   COMPETITION Normally when I have burgers it's usually Hero Burgers. After a Hero burger, I feel nasty and gross. Same goes for Burger Priest. They are great places to have a burger but so OILY having you feeling sick after. I normally can't finish it because of how oily it is.  APPROVED My picky husband approves of this place. He will now only have burgers from Fresh Burgers. No where else!"}
{"text":"Very good burger choice. I've been to many joints across the gta and this place fairs quite well. It's deserving of 4 stars solid. The owner is a former bay street fixture. He seems to have grasped the burger industry from a bullish standpoint."}
{"text":"This place does it right. Simple menu. Freshest ingredients. Staff that cares. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"It's really in the name: Fresh!   I have been to Fresh Burger many times and it never disappoints! Whenever I'm craving a nice juicy, delicious burger, fresh burger is the one that always comes to mind. You even see the employees cutting the fires behind the counter.   I usually order the 4oz regular fresh burger combo with added onions. The burger itself is extremely juicy but never feels too heavy. The special sauce is similar to Mac sauce which is delicious :) I always, always upgrade my fries to California fires which is on their secret menu. It is fries topped with caramelized onions, special sauce, and a slice of cheese. These are my most favourite fires in the world and are amazing if you're in to all those toppings.  If I had one criticism it's that I wish the burger meat had a little bit more salt but that's not enough for me to take off a star.   Thank you Fresh Burger for always serving perfect burgers and California fires!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a late lunch here today on my way home. Due to the hour, I think I caught them at a slow spot in their day, as the place was nearly empty; but the staff was ready and waiting to take my order, and seemed friendly and welcoming.  It was pretty easy to choose what I wanted, as they've got a very limited menu. I only really needed to think about what size of burger I wanted, and what to put on it. A limited menu has its pros and cons; and for me there are more cons than pros. I do like the idea that I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time humming and hawing about what I want to eat, but when it comes right down to it, I prefer at least a little more in the way of options. Chicken burger? Veggie burger? Onion rings? I understand from the signs on the wall that the limited menu keeps costs down for the franchisee, but to me this just limits my experience.  Now for the food:  All I can really say is it was good. Not great, but definitely worth the money. The burger was pretty plain tasting. They look and taste like they're just done on a flat-top, so not a lot of taste from the cooking method. The toppings were good. Nice and fresh, and I do like that cheese comes on the burger as a standard topping, but again, it just made it taste like a regular everyday cheeseburger. I was told there was going to be \"freshburger sauce\" on the burger, but if it was there it didn't really taste like anything.  Fries are good too. Nothing special, and a bit overcooked for my liking (this is definitely a personal preference though, as I tend to like my fries more on the soft side), but definitely worth eating.  All in all, kind of a mediocre experience. Nothing bad at all about the place, but nothing really great either."}
{"text":"Nothing not to like about this place. Straight up , fresh ingredients, well managed and fast for a place that makes every patty from scratch and to order (good things take time if you are looking for a fast burger go to mcdonalds) But my absolute favorite thing. Its not run and operated by pretencious hipsters that make you never wanna set foot in an establishment again (pay attention burger priest) And thats that"}
{"text":"When I heard that there was a place called Fresh Burger, I immediately was reminded of the cinematic classic masterpiece: Good Burger. You know; \"Welcome to good burger, may I take your order?\"  Honestly, I wasn't impressed with what I saw on their website, which is how I do 90% of all my research prior to visiting any restaurant. The location is unimpressive, but strategic as it is nearby the surrounding industrial park. It's actually the only place in the area serving to a burger loving demographic. The amount of competition from other restaurants in the area are immense, and also there's a Tim Horton's right next door. Fresh Burger better have some kind of a niche, because freshness isn't a strong enough product for me to park my car here.  I got here on a Wednesday evening for a gathering of burger enthusiasts. Our host was gracious enough to purchase all of the sides for us. Fries, poutine, Cali-fries which was caramelized onions served over fries covered in a mysterious sauce. Supposedly, this sauce was the deductive reasoning of the owner who figured out the sauce for a major California hamburger brand but made it even better. I didn't know any better and had no reference to compare the said sauce. I didn't need a reference, because it was damn good. If it even better, then what's the point of a reference?  I got the prime burger with Swiss cheese, and immediately upon my first bite I regretted not doubling up on the patties for a price increment that couldn't even hurt a hipster.  The soft fluffy texture of the beef crumbled like pastries, not a single tendon or any chewy parts--oh yes, I was eating pure beef. It required no explanation or further evidence that this patty was made right here, fresh as the store name claimed with a level of cut from the cow that is so rarely found in anything between two slices of bread. The uncompromising taste of 'never frozen' has redeemed my eagerness for that dreaded word of 'burger' to which I still cannot pin-point the origin.   Fresh burger is an unassuming space where all the efforts has been concentrated towards the quality of the food, leaving absolutely none for ambiance. The truth is, I couldn't care less about the horrendous orange paint, unpretentious drink options (free drink with any combo order), or even the compact estate.  When the food hits your taste buds, all matters of ambiance becomes immaterial, and the frivolities of non-food matters dissolve into thin air, and the only thing you are left with is the appreciation of God blessing you with a mouth.    On the website, the owner states: \"After 28 years in the financial industry I decided to create Fresh Burger to provide an honest hamburger experience.\" I had no idea the jackals in finance were responsible for the dishonest burger experience epidemic. I will be taking my business to the honesty of Fresh Burger from now on. Yes, Fresh Burger, you may take my order!"}
{"text":"Burgers that taste great. There is not much selection tho. Would be nice if they added a chicken burger. Everything is fresh, I usually call ahead to order before heading in to save some time because this place can get pretty packed. There is not much seating so be prepared to bring it back to the office. Was not a huge fan of the fries, although they are freshly cut, they were not crunchy enough. They were fairly soggy like eating Swiss chalet delivery fries. Nevertheless still a great burger."}
{"text":"The good: The food is damn tasty. The meat is delisioso as was the poutine. I will be going back soon enough for another meal.  The bad:  I was given a regular poutine instead of the cheeseburger poutine I ordered.  Also the burger did not have all the condiments I requested.  The owner himself was on cash and grill, and served the order so I would have expected to get what I paid for. If it was a part time teen employee that made the mistake instead I'd be more generous with my star rating."}
{"text":"Owner is very nice and the place is very clean. I wasn't overly impressed with the food. The fries taste like they are frozen. The paddy seemed like it was falling apart and the taste of a good burger just wasn't there. I've been to many burger places and I won't be returning. I could mention good places to try but I'm choosing to be nice"}
{"text":"This place had good reviews but I was skeptical. After trying it all doubt has been wiped out. I was never a fan of burgers priest and found holy chuck to be slighty better but still very similar so I was expecting this place to be more or less the same.  While they are all of similar ilk, I can honestly say that fresh burger for me had the most properly seasoned patty out of all of them. I actually enjoyed the flavor of the patty. Other than that, one is not much better than the other which makes me glad this place is in richmond hill."}
{"text":"Based upon on all the positive reviews from others and was looking to try something new around my workplace so I decided to give this place a go. The place is very clean and neat. I got the 4oz burger combo which comes with fries and a can of drink. I love the drink selections! They have can of apple or orange juice and lots of other options. The burger wasn't the greatest but ain't bad either. With just $11 and such a huge portion I think I can totally skip dinner tonight :)"}
{"text":"I think it's safe to say I have an addiction, I thought it was pizza, but no, it's burgers. And if my addiction has impacted you in a negative way... TOO BAD, because I'm going to get doing what I'm doing.   Even if I wanted to stop, with a place like Fresh Burger opening up in my hometown I couldn't even if I wanted. Their beef is my cocaine, their fries/poutine are my heroine and their special sauce... A fantastic psychedelic too strong for any man to withstand.   No wonder when: - each burger is hand formed and pressed on the flat top to order - fries are peeled in house, soaked to extract excess starch, blanched once to cook them half way and then fried to finish on order - sauce made in house is the perfect balance of ingredients that it can safely stand on it's own on any burger.   Little known fact is that Fresh Burger is modeled closely after the legendary California burger chain, In and Out Burger. Having eaten at I'nO when in San Francisco I can safely say that they've perfected the In and Out Burger and concept... And improved upon the original.   A burger buddy with me this evening made the observation that the burger was \"almost a fluffy texture.\" An excellent way to describe the melt in your mouth burger, bun and topping combination of their creations.   I'm thrilled to say that despite the burger renaissance currently occurring in Toronto, the best burger around is being served north of Hwy 7, in Richmond Hill. Don't believe me? Make the trek and you'll see.   Fresh Burger has accomplished in 4 months what other burger joints can only aspire to and it's burgers are one addiction I'm happy to have."}
{"text":"got the #1 combo just a single freshburger with fries and a soda. Fries was quite similar to 5 guys maybe with a bit more crunch and salt level was great. The burger was quite nicely balanced but i would like to have more char on my burger coming off a flat top, there was no crunch factor going on and i think they use more leaner meat than 5 guys.  So overall it was a nicely balanced burger that needed a bit more tweaking. It felt like a burger that you can get on your cheat day that would not entirely derail your low cal diet if u stay away from the fries that is."}
{"text":"Busy place, but has sufficient seating.  Burgers are freshly made and are a decent size (i.e. meatier than your cheapo fast-food joints), but lack customization (other than adding onions and pickles).  Great selection of seasoning and condiments for fries.  Poutine's gravy was a tad salty and curds weren't very melted.  Great service and clean place."}
{"text":"Yum Fresh Burgers (thinking of that moment before the first bite of that burger).  This is a solid burger place in the Richmond Hill area. I tried the double freshburger (8oz) combo and upgraded my fries to a poutine since other yelpers recommend it.  I came here with no expectations. Once my order was ready and I saw the burger itself, I started to salivate because it looks so good! After one bite, I was sold that this is a great burger. The condiments were fresh and the patty has a great texture. The burger was hot and everything blended well together.  The poutine had a lot of cheese curds and gravy but I find that it was a bit salty to my liking.  Comparing to other burger places I visit frequently, the prices here are definitely alright. There is not that much seating if you want to go during off hours that would be better. However, they are renovating and adding more tables and seats to this location.  Overall, this place serves solid burgers as it comes #2 in my burger ranking of places in Toronto."}
{"text":"With so many options in this world it's kinda nice to eat somewhere where the menu just offers burgers and fries to maintain the freshness and quality that other fast food joints lack. That's what I like about this place and oh boy is it delicious. Burger are 100% Canadian beef ground in-house everyday which means they're never frozen. Toppings are kept simple - lettuce, tomato, and special sauce (a request is required for pickles and red onions) with the option to add for $1 bacon, sautéed jalapenos, cheddar cheese, provolone cheese, swiss cheese caramelized onions, or mushrooms. Fries are also peeled and cut in-house. I highly recommend upgrading the fries to a poutine. It does not disappoint. You can also order online ahead of pick-up to avoid line-ups. Online says that service time is 7 minutes. Drinks options include a variety of pop options but not a lot of non-carbonated choices.  Verdict: No false advertisement here -  these are great fresh burgers!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place multiple times before but never really tried it till today. I had the Freshburger combo and I must say that the burgers really are the star of the show here. The beef patties were really juicy and tasty especially with the melted cheese on it. The only real complaint I have is that the buns are kinda cold and not toasted. Other than that, the burgers are really good. On the other hand, the fries are okay. Nothing too amazing about them, so they're pretty standard. They are pretty generous with the amount of fires they give you though. With the combo, it comes with a drink and I absolutely appreciate how many different types of drinks they have for you to choose. Overall, I'd probably give this place 4.5/5. I definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Best burger and fries I've had in at least two years!  Hawaiian is rockin', juicy, combo."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night just before closing time (7:20pm) saw a lineup with a large family waiting on their order..  I asked if they could make my patties rare and the young cook told me he would try but they are really busy with back orders.  It was just the two of them covering cash and pumping out burgers on a very busy night!  Did they turn anyone away? Did they tell customers that it's closing time and they had to leave?   No to both. These two guys were working extremely hard on the tail-end  of their shift but kept being kind and providing great service along with excellent burgers.  I will always come back to this place and recommend just based on customer service today!"}
{"text":"The cashier when I ordered was super super nice and friendly. This burger literally reminded me of a shake shack burger and I was all for it..  It melted in my mouth and was super delicious. Will definitely come back to try the poutines I've heard good things about. But I got the regular fresh burger and was def a fan!!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST Burgers to be had in the GTA. Quality blend of meats. Cooked to perfection. Perfectly salted. The caramelized onions and grilled jalepenos add a nice sweet and hot flavour to the burger (though a little goes a long way). The bread stays together until the last bite unlike a Burger's Priest one that disintegrates half way through. Fries are decent. Better Gravy than BP.BTW my go to order is the Double Fresh Burger w/ House Sauce & Pickles when I crave the salt & when looking for sweet and savoury I substitute the pickles for the caramelized onions and jalepenos. Great & Fast service. David the owner is always on point and makes sure that you feel welcome there!! A MUST have."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday and it would be a 3.5 if I could give it.   Pros - Burgers were slightly above bar. Kind of tasted like the Angus burger at McDonald's.   Cons - Food was pricey for what was given."}
{"text":"I came here the other day with my son, and we just got some simple cheesburgers. They were absolutely delicious. The burgers had so many flavors and were a great for the price! They looked just like the pictures they had on the menus and had such little grease, it was surprising! The simplicity of the menu made it easy for my son to pick what he wanted but being able to just point at the picture and say \"I want that one!\"  Also, the service was fast for such a busy burger joint and everyone was just so nice to us."}
{"text":"Love this place! Jacques and his staff are nice and friendly.  Their double prime burger with cheese is absolutely delicious and not to mention good portion size for the price you pay. I am always full and still have a bit of fires leftover when I'm done."}
{"text":"3.75 Fresh burgers are fresh burgers. Period.  The buns are good. The meat is good. I like adding mushrooms jalapeños and some Cheese. They use sunshine buns and you can find them at the food basics grocery store.   Their secret fries with their secret sauce is a little much sometimes but it's better than their poutine. I find their gravy too salty.   Not a perfect restaurant though. Their fries aren't good. Too bad. Fries are so important. They need to compliment the burger. Esp when the menu is so small.  The workers there seem very uninterested. That sucks. But there's a Japanese lady who works there who seems to show passion to serve. She might be the owners wife? Sweet lady.   Also I like the clorex wipes. Use these to wipe down your tables before you eat."}
{"text":"Simply the worst burger I've ever had. The one star is for the staff. The food though awfully non-fresh and tasteless."}
{"text":"I like to consider myself a burger connoisseur and of all the places I've tried so far this one gets \"the whole package\" done right.  There's enough beef to taste it, the toppings are no frills, and fresh as you can get, the bun-burger ratio is just right enough that you can taste and feel the crunch of the sear on the burger.  The fries actually taste like potatoes should.  Best part of all, its not greasy, and the bun stays properly dry throughout eating it, due to the proper build of a burger.  Easiest five out of five I've ever given."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0  Perfect place for a classic burger. The patty is grilled nicely with a slight crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. Would prefer the burger sauce to have a bit more tart."}
{"text":"Great burger and poutine, I ordered the prime rib burger so juicy! Not too salty like most places, the poutine has a nice gravy and authentic cheese curds, I base my experience with the first 3 bites and every bite was delicious, packed at 12 so go at 1 if you want to get a table, food came out very fast I give it 4 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, tasty meat patties, and simple.  Cali fries is almost the same as In and Out animal style fries.  The Poutine is delicious and the staff is uber friendly."}
{"text":"Food - 5 Drinks - 4 (lots of pop options and no alcohol) Staff - 4  Service - 4 (not full service, they say their service time is 7 mins) Décor - 4 (spacious and simple) Atmosphere - 4  Cleanliness - 5 Portion - 4 Price-Point - 4  Must-Tries: - Prime burger (6oz) (added bacon and cheese) and a poutine is a must.  All burgers come with lettuce, tomato, and special sauce (Extra toppings are $1 each - bacon, sautéed jalapenos, cheddar cheese, provolone cheese, swiss cheese caramelized onions, mushrooms)  Perks: - 100% premium Canadian beef that is ground fresh on site every day (never frozen) - Potatoes for fries are peeled and cut by hand - Peanut-free restaurant - Accept online orders for pick-up to avoid line-ups  Downer: - No vegetarian options - No gluten-free bun options - No delivery service but it is available through Foodor and Just Eats - Drink options are mainly pop/soda  Tips: - You have to ask for red onions or pickles as free toppings if you want it   ig: @freshburgercanada"}
{"text":"My third burger from this place, just never got around to writing a review :P. Gotta say, it gets better every time! Except this time I got the Double Fresh Burger (8 oz) compared to the Prime Burger (6 oz) the other 2 times. Pretty busy today (lunch) but didn't have to wait long at all.  The burgers...are amazing. Very fresh (as the name states lol) and lots of taste. The texture of the patty is also excellent. Only gripe I could have is that the bun got a bit soggy for me.  The fries were pretty good. Not too much salt, which is definitely good.  If you have a burger craving this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"One of, if not, the best tasting burgers I have ever enjoyed. Good quality bacon as well. Not the biggest fan of the special sauce, but that is something that I can always skip next visit.  Can't wait to try the cheeseburger poutine, though."}
{"text":"This place surprised me, good reviews and all this place delivered, literally, i ordered via just eat and the food arrived hot and fresh, their fries are excellent, fresh cut and delicious, perfectly cooked. their poutine was excellent with fresh cheese curds and lots of them. The burgers are just the way i like it, juicy and cooked perfectly, and the patties were not too thick either. Topped off by a very Fresh bun, crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes that haven't gone mushy.i really loved this place. These people obviously care about the product they produce and it shows. I will definitely be back/order again."}
{"text":"Great Burgers! I don't normally eat nor like eating burgers however I have recently had a craving for a juicy burger and this place definitely quenched that cravings. Eventhougb atmosphere isn't the greatest, if my friends ever want to grab a burger I'd definitely recommend this location. Burgers are big, juicy and flavourful! The fries also are big and they use fresh potatoes that have been cut and fried. It is not crowded or too busy so the wait does not take long. Writing this review and thinking about that juicy burger is making me crave it again. Can't wait to return and try out their poutine next time!"}
{"text":"Great place amazing burgers and poutine. Well worth the 10 to 15 min wait. Not as expensive as all the other high end burger places."}
{"text":"This was a really solid burger, definitely top notch and fresh, and cooked perfectly.  The bun was soft and soaked up everything, which is what a bun should do.  The staff was super friendly and efficient as well, I'm only here for a week but guessing I will be back several times before leaving."}
{"text":"The patty is delicious and is definitely fresh and I love the poutine but I was thoroughly disappointed with the bun. Mine was cold, not grilled or anything. You can't tell me that they wouldn't push it to the ultimate grease factor by slopping on some butter and pressing their buns.   When I eat a burger, I eat it because I want something greasy, I want something that's worth cheat day. It tastes great but it is missing that key extra factor (for me)."}
{"text":"Being to Fresh Burger a few times.   Great burgers and fresh fries!!!     Pros: - Fresh burger custom cook to order.  I like it well done and burnt. - Fresh fries - Friendly staff - Service was pretty fast - Burger and fries taste great.  Cons: - Very little seating for lunch crowd since they are very busy during lunch time. - Poutine portion is a little small.  Overall, I give it a thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"My family is new to the area and my little adorable daughter has been asking for In-N-Out, chain of fast food burger restaurants primarily on the west coast of America.  Thanks to fellow yelper Peter M, I found Fresh Burger.  Although the hamburgers here are more artisanal style, my daughter still loved the taste and of course, the fries, too!  Thank you for helping us navigate the new neighborhood, PM."}
{"text":"The burgers were fantastic: fresh, perfect texture and a nice mild and fatty flavour. The fries were very good, and the top 40 hits were on point."}
{"text":"I had been eyeing this place after visiting their neighbour Nam a couple times. I'm so glad I finally checked it out. Ordered the prime rib burger and their secret menu Cali fries. One word: delicious!! This place reminded me of in and out. The burger was simple with cheese, lettuce and tomato, but it was a perfect juicy burger. The Cali fries were topped with caramelized onions, cheese and their freshburger sauce. The onions were on the sweeter side, but I loved it and the fries stayed crispy all the way to the end. Yummm. Will be frequenting this place whenever I'm craving a burger and fries."}
{"text":"Came during grand opening period and received a fresh burger on the house.  It was a 4 oz patty, with tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, cheese, and onions. The burger was quite small. Taste was alright, not too greasy. Wasn't too impressed with the lettuce; I like it when it's just a huge leaf rather than the sliced up ones you get from those salad bags. Definitely feels healthier than a lot of other burger places though, and the texture of the meat feels like meat.  We also ordered a poutine. It came in a small styrofoam container. Cheese curds were nice and chewy, though the gravy was a bit too salty.  Overall, it's not a bad option if you're craving burgers and looking for one that's not too heavy."}
{"text":"This gem of a burger place is tucked away in a small plaza on the corner of leslie and 16th. The place itself is small with a few tables for those who choose to eat in. We wouldn't have thought of trying this but for the great reviews in Yelp. Soooo worth the visit. The burgers taste fresh (hence the name) and juicy. I ordered the standard 4oz and it was perfect. The fries are also perfectly crisp and seasoned. The poutine is worth the extra money to upsize your combo. We'll definitely be visiting this place again for any future burger cravings."}
{"text":"Came here expecting something different. Burger patty was pretty bland. Big M's on Kennedy and Steeles are 10 times tastier and juicier. I rarely crave for burgers but if I do I'll go for Mc ds fir big m."}
{"text":"Ordered a Prime burgers with fries and gravy.  As a good chef once said love a place that just sticks with a simple menu and gets it right.  Great burgers made fresh good fresh cut fries even the gravy was on point.  The only reason it's not 5 stars was I wanted more fries lol.  Will be on my favourite list"}
{"text":"Delicious burger and fries for a great price!  I had the 4oz Fresh burger with hand cut fries and drink.   The burger is topped with cheese, lettuce,tomato and their special sauce.  Optional items include pickles and onions.   I opted for the pickles and onion! It elevated my burgers flavor 100%  All in all fresh burger is my new favorite burger joint!  Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"They only take deliveries for 100$ in their Richmond hill location. Love that this isn't ANYWHERE on their website.   Good burgers though, so it's a shame about this.   FYI this merits a review because it states on your Yelp page you do delivery. Catering and delivery are two different things."}
{"text":"The prime burger was so good! I especially liked that I didn't feel like falling into a coma right after because it wasn't overly heavy or salty. I also liked the simplicity of the toppings and sauce they added. The buns were also really good without being overly dense or airy. Most importantly, you can tell that they use real beef! None if those 'patties' There was also sufficient char. I'm so glad to have tried this place and will be coming again. Thanks yelp for the 5 dollar burger binge!"}
{"text":"Craving for burger if your living in uptown (markham/richmondhill area), this is definitely a place to go! But if I get to choose I would rather go to Holy Chuck or Burger Priest. The poutine was good, overall it was okay but didn't impress me too much. Will go back if I don't want to drive far for a burger and a way better choice than Mcd."}
{"text":"Sitting at a near perfect overall rating (edit: oh awks, it was a 4.5 before this review pulled it down to a 4), I've had this place bookmarked for months so I finally decided to give it a try after it was further hyped by YelpGTA's recent March Muchness battle-off on Instagram. I came on a nice, breezy, sunny day and for a little under $10 after tax, I got myself a double freshburger with all the toppings except for onions. It was a picture-perfect set up - I sat near the opened garage patio, the spring weather was beautiful, and the service was great. Needless to say, I had my hopes up.. and unfortunately, I wasn't blown away.    I can only give this restaurant a maximum of 3 stars as a way of tipping my hat to them for doing well at what they do.. but it wasn't a spectacular burger worth going out of my way for. Let me explain. The burger was exactly what you would anticipate from a regular diner, except that this was fast food. No surprises, no bursts of novel flavours, no deviations from the norm..  just your regular everyday burger! A standard beef patty, a slice of processed cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and condiments.   As a liquor-licensed restaurant, I can appreciate the appeal that they offer to customers who just want to kick back and have a beer with their burger, but I don't see the big deal for everyone else. The burger was just so mediocre and it didn't provide that satiable feeling that greasier, juicier, and more loaded North American burgers typically do. I'm not saying all burgers should be like that, but if I had to choose, my two sides of the spectrum would be healthy, clean, fancy burger (eg: Bareburger) vs. greasy, filling, artery-clogging burger (eg: Holy Chucks). This... in-between burger that's neither filling nor fancy just puts me at a weird place that I deem not worth my quota or my money.   Take my review as you will! I can appreciate that people may enjoy what this burger joint has to offer but for my experience, it was underwhelming and I wouldn't really recommend it for everyone."}
{"text":"I was finally able to visit this place, and even now, i don't know what all the hype is about. It feels like any other burger place, except that it is more expensive. The burgers are plain. Any toppings that you want to put on it is extra, it is expensive, and there wasn't really anything special about the toppings.   I agree, the burgers are fresh, but other than that, there really isn't anything special. There are basically four options; one 4 oz burger, or one 6 oz burger and then their equivalent double patty. All the frills are extra; ie. bacon, cheese, mushrooms, etc.   I ordered a prime (6oz) bacon cheese burger with poutine and the total came out to just under $20.00. I was really shocked.... you can go to other places for cheaper and just as fresh.   The overall atmosphere was just like any other hamburger joint. line up at the front to order, and then tables where you can sit. No waiting staff or anything else. No trays, just a paper bag where you can bring your food to the table. A reminder to those who might rip the bag open like what I did... it will be a pain to clean.   Overall, i'm not really sure that I will go back."}
{"text":"The name says it all - FRESH! The first few times I went I could only say that about the burgers, but now it's everything! They have recently expanded into two units so there's more fun and more burgers for all. Came on a Saturday just after 11 am (opening). Surprising there were already people there but the was definitely not long. Its a fast casual location, where you order at the front and can sit down or take out as you wish.   I always order the double fresh burger and its always nice. Patty is juicy, bun is not soggy, and the other toppings (lettuce, tomato, pickles) mesh well together. Just like krabby patties there must be some secret formula to create such a masterpiece. Fries are good, long pieces that are not overly oily. Drinks are self serve and they've got a wide selection of Coke (*owner edit: AND PEPSI!) related products.    Did I mention free wifi? All in all a nice casual place to enjoy a burger. Prices are comparable to other spots (11.50) for the double fresh burger. Bonus (for me at least) is that its super close and convenient! Just off Leslie and 16th."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a good burger?  Fresh Burger's menu is very simple - they do burgers and they do them well!  Recently renovated and expanded (they took over the space next door as well) - this is because I'm not the only one who loves their burgers!  Do yourself a favour and get the Prime burger instead of the basic burger.  The patties are juicy and remind me of In-N-Out in the West Coast.  Combos come with Fries and a can of pop.  They do have a crazy selection of soft drinks in their fridge.  Their fries are also done well and they provide a lot.  4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Simplicity is always better!   They only have two different burgers on their menu other than the option to double up. We had one of each with a poutine as well.  It's really expensive if you're comparing it to other fast food places but it was worth it! (paid 29 and change for 4oz fresh burger, 12oz prime burger a poutine and drink) you could get a burger at a sit-down restaurant but I think do it better here anyways ;)   The burgers were really good, it was really similar to shack shake with in-n-out's sauce..? I opted to keep the burger as is with extra onions, my partner added mushrooms and said she really enjoyed it as well. The poutine was really big as it was more than enough for us to share but the fries weren't really crispy (it's hard to make fresh cut fries crispy especially combined with gravy) so I didn't really enjoy it thaaaat much but that's just a personal thing lol. To put it in prospective; I really enjoy Costco poutine more than anything LOL.   The service was pretty good for a fast food joint, workers came by here and there to clean tables and check up on customers/ get their feedback. Nothing negative to write home about.   The only reason why they lose a star is, wait time. The wait time was a little longer than I expected, can't remember exactly how long but it was more than 15 minutes but nothing over 20."}
{"text":"K-I-S-S. Keep it Simple, Stupid. Fresh Burger does it right. Simple menu, simple items, simple prices.... and what do you get? An amazing burger. Can eat the burger without sauce, but definitely get the special freshburger sauce. Well made, good solid ingredients and quick and strong execution.   For lunch I had the freshburger combo...for a flat $10. Great value. Great option if you're in the nearby Markham / Richmond Hill business complexes."}
{"text":"I have to say I was not expecting much but this place blew me away!   Small burger joint located on Leslie and just south of 16th ave that offers fresh burgers. It has a simple menu and that's all you need from this place! Their burgers was juicy, not greasy. Patty was cooked perfectly, with a little pink in the center. The bun was soft and the ingredients were fresh. Pickles and onions needs to be asked to be added at no additional cost (everything taste better with onions!!) I like their fresh burger sauce which reminds me of Big Mac sauce but with less relish. They also have other sauces like garlic aioli for additional cost that I would try next time.   A combo order comes with fries and drinks. The drink selection is quite large - you can pick from pop juice or water and there was a lot of different drinks to choose from. I had a poutine upgrade for $2.99 and their poutine was disappointing. It had good serving size, loaded with gravy and cheese but it was way too salty. I couldn't finish the poutine due to the saltiness of it.   The staff was friendly and the place itself had limited seatings. In front they had a tray of seasonings and condiments. It even has Cajun seasoning which made their fries more flavourful.   I give the burger 5/5 but because of the unbearable saltiness of the poutine, i'd have to rate Fresh Burger an overall of 4/5. Their fresh burger for $5.59 is reasonable price for the quality you're getting. Definitely coming back for their burgers!!"}
{"text":"If Burger Priest and Five guys had a baby it would be Fresh Burger.   The fries are nearly identical to the burger priest, but they provide a poutine option which is awesome.   The only downside would be the super focused menu, it really is a place only for hardcore burger lovers.  The price point is impressive.   One of the best burgers in the city."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because the office \"burger expert\" overheard me say i wanted a burger.  Immediately i googled mapped it, planned my work escape.  I showed up dripping wet from the rain and ordered the #1 well done.  Oh my.. delicious.  I did not even take a pic because i attacked it!  Next go at the burger,  I'm trying it with jalapenos!  Who are these burger geniuses?"}
{"text":"Very good burger!  I got the single burgers with fries and a pop. Came to about $11. Burger was very good though I think next time I would get the double burger. It was about 1/4lb patty which with the fries was good for a lunch. The food was all fresh and you got a good amount of fries. They had malt vinegar too which I always look for at a burger place.  I would say this is a VERY good basic burger place. Not a gourmet burger place like what is popping up everywhere but if you want a good burger it's a great spot. It was also nice they had a patio however it was too hot today so I sat inside."}
{"text":"Love this place! The burgers are great! People are so pleasant and they were playing reggae music to tie it all together. The burgers were juicy and cooked just enough that the edges was crispy. Love the burger sauce that they put on your burger. The combos are come with fries and can pop! Poutine is perfect with the amount of cheese and gravy. A definite must try! FYI they accept the PLATINUM PLUS card."}
{"text":"I am.. I'm.. No words to say how impressed I am. Had a fresh burger with coworkers and it was just.. just.. No words. The meat so fresh and perfectly cooked it was still slightly pink on the inside. It was such a delicacy even for modern times like the 2018s.. Gut damn, the lettuce was so crispy especially when topped with onions. Had a full on foodgasm in the middle of work, I wasn't able to contain my composure. The next day all my coworkers did was rave about it and we decided to do round two. This time I ordered a fresh burger with caramelized onion and mushrooms.. I was in burger heaven. The sweetness of the onions complimented the savoury taste of that beef. After my second experience, I thought it was enough for the week.. NOT! The third day I ordered the prime burger without all the extras. Gut damn.. Gut damn! Like I said before, words cannot express how good and FRESH that bugger was! Can't really do it justice with this review except to go and try it out for yourself! Please do yourselves all a favour and go get a FRESH bugger :)  Thanks team, you guys are doing a fantastic job!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger, decided to go with double freshburger since 4 and 6 would be too small for me. Two double 4 oz patty was good. Good patty, good combo, and price. Cant say I hate it. I will probably be back  13 buck for 8oz combo isn't bad,"}
{"text":"Looking for a good burger then this is the place. Fresh ingredients and crispy fries. Busy little spot that I would recommend if you need a burger fix."}
{"text":"I got the fresh burger with fries and a drink. The burger comes with tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, and sauce, and you can add pickles and onions for no extra charge. I found the burger too salty and the sauce really runny. The fries were pretty good, and they give a generous portion of them. Overall, I thought it was nothing special and a little overhyped. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say this is the best burger in the GTA, and I've tried a lot.  These guys focus on just a basic burger, no messing around.  I can scarf one back and not feel bloated.  Somehow this burger seems light, from the tender and juicy beef to the soft bun, they do it the best."}
{"text":"**update** they've expanded this location. There's more seating and way more spacious! Love it. Burgers are still as amazing."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoons got me hunkering for a good burger so I thought I would try this newcomer to my hood.  Very simple yet straightforward menu giving you choice of combos and varying size burgers. I chose a prime burger and the regular burger combo (6oz and 4oz respectively). Prices are comparable to Five Guys however the toppings cost 1.50 for any special items that Five Guys gives you free (on some).  Patties are fresh not frozen and the fries were pretty good and generously given. I would recommend share one order fries between two people. They also offer a cool selection of pop and cuz I worked hard today I spoiled myself with a cream soda!!  Place was clean, service fast and friendly! Definitely would return when the next craving hits!"}
{"text":"The food is great. It really earns the name fresh burger. Everything is made on-site in a \"5 guys\" style. The only downfall is their service. Every single time I come in here it seems like the guy who takes my order is depressed and it kind of brings you down. The atmosphere is great, has rock n roll playing, and good food at great prices, but the staff are just total downers. It's a shame to see their 5 star review has slowly been lowered since their grand opening but that's how the burger crumbles."}
{"text":"I guess for a burger joint in Markham it's good. Can't touch the Priest or even 5 Guys for that matter. The burger was good, I couldn't decipher if the special sauce was plain mayo or actual sauce. This may be kind of picky but I really didn't like that they toast their bun, it tasted like it was toasted in the oven.... Not my thing... The fries tasted frozen even though I know they aren't, they had no colour and because there was a lack of caramelization there was almost no flavour."}
{"text":"The burgers here are delicious and juicy. The poutines are even better! Portion is plenty.  I love to come back when in the area and craving a burger.  Much better deal than the highly rated burgers priest.  They have some tables and seats so you could eat there comfortably so, although many take it to go.  Service was good, a nice family."}
{"text":"Solid burgers and fries. A bit pricey but not too bad when compared to a major fast food burger chain. Limited options on their menu so they can focus on what they do best."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had! So fresh and juicy! The crisp on the bread added a nice touch."}
{"text":"Pretty hard to rate considering the burger was free (grand opening special).  I enjoyed it and the patty was very fresh.  It's a very plain and simple burger and they don't try to fancy it up.  I also ordered fries and they were very good.    Here's what I can tell you though: the owner is very involved in quality control and was watching each of his employees very closely on how long the patty should be cooked, the exact amount of salt on the fries, etc and I was very pleased to see this.  If anything, I can tell this place will be very consistent.  I'll visit again next week and pay for a burger and write an updated review at that time."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers. Does not need no sauce or anything. Beef tastes great. I come here regularly. Recommended."}
{"text":"My gosh!!! One of the best burgers I've ever had. You can tell the ingredients are fresh, and the food is tasty! I got the 4oz burger and my husband got the poutine. It took us literally minutes to inhale it all up, haha! Better than Whataburger (a place back in TX), and trust me...that says a lot. Will be back when we visit again!!"}
{"text":"I had a double Freshburger and upgraded to Poutine fries, both were very good, but my 5 start is for the two guys running this joint! I have just arrived from Los Angeles for a business trip and had forgot to get my debit cards approved for International transactions.  After several attempts they told me to just pay them another time.  Tell me the last time you have heard anything like that from any business. I was fortunately able to get one of my cards working while they made my food.  I will definitely be returning during this trip and spreading the word of the tasty food and incredible service."}
{"text":"I went at the urging of my husband on a particularly emotional day so basically dragged my feet all the way there.  When we pulled into the small parking lot, I saw the outside of the store and thought great, no customers and basically was not impressed.  When we walked in you see the menu all over the walls with nice Yelp sponsored posters on both sides.  The kitchen is open concept and they have very few tables to dine in at.    So we placed our orders and I asked if they had anything for kids.  We were told they did not offer kid sized burgers so I was a little bit put off but ordered two burger combos and an extra hamburger.  We decided to eat there and they simply gave us everything in take out containers.  Again, I was a bit put off by the brown bags and having to dig through the bag to get my burger.  So I asked for a knife to cut in half for my daughter and they had to take the burger all the way to the back and cut it up as they had no plastic knives.  When I finally got settled and ate my burger the first bite had my mood completely turned around.  You could taste the freshness of the patties and I enjoyed every morsel and didn't even have to put ketchup on it.  Absolutely juicy and savoury to the last bite.  I up sized my fries to their poutine and I have to say it was one of the best poutines I have come across.  Lots of cheese curds and gravy over fresh fries.    Overall, I would have given it a 5/5 based on fast, but the overall experience and customer service knocked it down to a 4/5."}
{"text":"Me and my SO have been going to Fresh Burger since they opened. We love going to different burger joints in the GTA and I must say this place has the best-tasting burgers I've had. Burgers are very tasty. The buns good and the poutine - WOW you gotta try them!! In some burger places you barely taste the patty and the toppings usually overpower the taste of the patty but with Fresh Burger, the patty is all you taste. Did I say the patty is tasty? The service is good and fast :) the owner is very friendly.. the place is neat and well-kept. Washrooms are clean as well. Just try this place! You'd love it!!"}
{"text":"Honestly a super tasty burger and really delicious fries! The perfect answer to your burger and fries craving!  I'm already dreaming of my next trip!!   We got 2 of the #1 combos, the 4oz single patty combo. With an added 2.99 we upgraded one of our combos to a poutine.   The burger- so delicious, the bread was soft, the party was juicy and the toppings were just enough to make it a classic and substantial burger. Really no complaints about the burger!!   The fries- these were also SO good! I think they cut them fresh on site. They also give you a very generous portion with the combo, which comes in a baggie.   The poutine- nothing extraordinary but still delicious. Probably wouldn't come here for their poutine but definitely still ok if you're feeling it and want to upgrade your combo!!   Only complaint is that all of their meals are given to go and wrapped in wax papers, and then in a paper bag. I felt like its an unnecessary production of waste since it looked like the majority of customers sat down to eat, instead of taking away!    Lastly, since it was summer- they've got a really nice area for outdoor seating and also a huge walk out window/garage door type set up which opens up the atmosphere for the indoors! I really enjoyed this on a nice summer day!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the few good burger places in Richmond Hill / Markham...  The place was introduced by a friend, claiming that the burgers are great and couldn't wait to check it out.  About the Price, I would like to say that is really good CA$5.60 just the burger, and with fries and drink is like about $10... the issue is that each toping cost extra.. the good thing is that you pay what you get.  The quality, no doubt is really good, I would like to say that is really close to Five Guys quality. the paddy is soft and juicy. Is indeed that they take their time to make it good.  The place is simple and everyone looks really happy, not much to say actually. The Staff is really friendly, the place is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Wow what a pleasure to have a burger go to place uptown. It basically follows the In N Out formula out west, fresh and simple. In fact the taste and packaging is very close. And a lot cheaper than Burger Priest.   Ample parking and seating (most get takeout)."}
{"text":"Never dissapoints. BEST burger joint in the GTA!!  Fresh cut fries with juiciest burgers.  Highly recommend after 2years."}
{"text":"Open kitchen concept you can see everything, how fresh fries are made and the burger orders.   Burger was a good size it wasn't flat. Toppings were fresh.  Price is a little pricier but it was good."}
{"text":"Very delicious burgers! I was pleasantly surprised :). Ordered two cheeseburgers and a poutine for pickup. The burgers were juicy, flavorful, and the toppings were generous, fresh, and delicious. Poutine gravy was very tasty and their cheese curds were great!! Melty, but still hold their form. If you're in a rush I would recommend calling and ordering as it took about 12-15 minutes to prepare. Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to get a burger in Richmond hill.   I have been to burger priest, but I find fresh burgers parties are much more juicy.   The fresh burger sauce is delicious I can eat it with everything. It's a mixture of mayonnaise, ketchup, and relish I believe. It has similar flavour to thousands island sauce.   The staff is super friendly, and very nice. The only downfall is that they close early! I believe they close at everyday but Sunday they close at 7!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers but too small (even the 6oz) and too much $. The cashier was enthusiastic and friendly, the opposite of the person in charge of the grill. Personalization of your burger is obviously frowned upon, but it's okay as their own sauce and other toppings are pretty good. Recommend it overall, but maybe not as a regular hangout for somebody that eats out every day."}
{"text":"Just a solid burger. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the burger patty itself is just damned good.   I can eat a horse when I'm hungry, and for $13 for the double fresh burger with fries and a drink, I was very satisfied with the price and how full I was.   5 more dollars will get you a Vatican with bacon and fries at Burger' Priest, and that is definitely better. But for this price, I'm a happy customer!"}
{"text":"I made the trek from Mississauga to Richmond Hill because of testimonials that Fresh Burger was comparable to In-N-Out, the famous burger joint in western USA. If you've been to In-N-Out, you'll know that it's well worth a 45 minute drive.   I arrived at Fresh Burger on a weekday around noon, as excited as one could be. It was packed. I grew confident that their burgers were going to meet my lofty expectations. I ordered the $5 burger that they offered as part of their participation in Yelp's Burger Binge week (great promotion, btw!), and waited eagerly.   ...And it let me down. Not because it wasn't a good burger - it was actually a great burger! And if I lived in Richmond Hill, I'd probably be a regular customer. That's how good it was. But it didn't taste anything like the In-N-Out burger I was expecting. I was disappointed because of the bar that others had set before me. But you know what? That's okay, because those comparisons that others had made got my attention, and allowed me to make the journey to visit what I truly believe is one of the best burgers in the GTA.   PS. I do understand where the In-N-Out comparisons come from. They even have \"California-style fries\", which mimics the famous \"Animal-style\" fries."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers in the city. Always comes out fresh just as the name implies. Cooked perfectly and always the right amount of burger for your burger appetite."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to try the much talked about 'Fresh Burger'.  I feel like every burger boutique gets a lot of buzz, so I don't know that I was expecting much from this outing.  The service was....weird.  The young guy working the counter was very standoffish.  He barely uttered a hello, no smile, and it was very off putting.  My husband and I actually exchanged a look over it.  The food: we both had the double fresh burger and we got an order of the cali fries (fries, carmelized onion, cheese and special sauce).  The cali fries were very heavy and not for me, and next time I will opt for gravy.  The burgers were REALLY good!  They were juicy and the sauce on them was to die for.  My 3 year old enjoyed his burger too - and ate almost the whole thing.  Gosh, I can't wait to go back.  The owner came in half way through our meal.  He was very nice, unlike his employee.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try. Small, clean establishment with limited seating. Price is in line with other 'fresh' burger joints. Service is good.   Burger had a nice grind. Not too fine. Simple toppings didn't mask the taste or flavour of the nicely cooked party. Overall a good burger. Fries were 'real' and generous in portion.  With all the choices now in burger joints in the GTA it's debatable which are the best but Fresh Burger should be included in the list.  UPDATE Oct 2015:  Over the past year Fresh Burger has maintained a consistently high quality of their food. Burgers are still fresh, juicy and cooked just right (slightly pink inside). Fries too are perfect golden brown.  While other burger joints have let their quality slide Fresh Burger remains a welcome place for good food."}
{"text":"The burger here is exceptional. Richmond Hill/Markham were long overdue for a good burger. This place is truly authentic. Father & son run the show, grandma peels potatoes in the back. They bring meat in and grind it onsite. The restaurant is not pretentious and not overrun and it's not trying to be anything. Function over form.  I was pleasantly surprised. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Tried the regular fresh burger, prime burger, poutine (not all at once).   Everything is super tasty.  Burger purists heaven. Poutine is as québécois as it gets considering then owner is from there."}
{"text":"Solid burger. People coming in and out and eventually a long lineup during lunch time on Sunday. They are expanding, so hopefully it will get less crowded once it's done. Juicy patty with fresh tomato and lettuce. The sauce really brought everything together. Buns were soft but not fragile. I couldn't have asked for a better burger for that price. I love gourmet burgers, but sometimes it's good to have a classic, old-school burger."}
{"text":"Found some great reviews on this place... to be honest the burgers were fine, nothing to like rejoice over. However getting the fries California Style, was amazing, best specialty fries that i've ever had at a burger spot, so I hook it up with a 3 star based on the fries alone. If you try this place def get them done that way."}
{"text":"What is there to say?  There are already over 80 reviews, and a lot of Elites have graded Fresh Burger at the top of the heap.  All I know is that I left the store with a 6 ounce Prime Burger, and I can't find it anymore.  All I can see is this empty wrapper, brown paper bag, and a soiled napkin. And I want another one!  Now!!  I MEAN RIGHT NOW!!!!"}
{"text":"Second visit in two weeks, decided to have it again for my cheat meal. I love the simplicity of the burgers made at this place - their beef patty is made from ground sirloin fresh daily and is not greasy at all. Toppings are always fresh as well and the bun just compliments the burger   (and no I have no tried other gourmet burgers: Burger's Priest or Holy Chuck - as FB is my go to joint) Ordered it with fries again, same quality as my last review, delicious. They do have California fries which are not on the menu but you can order it - which consists of caramelized onions cooked on the stove top with american cheese and then their fresh burger sauce. It was pretty delicious if you're on an onion person because they load that thang up. Anyhow - will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Came here with a small group from work for lunch on a Friday.  Arrived just before noon and a line already started to form.  Glad we got there when we did though - within 10 minutes the line was out the door, and even though we were there early, it took about 15 minutes to prepare our orders!  Fast food this is not; the service at similar establishments (eg. Hero Burger) is much quicker..  On to the food..  The poutine was good - squeaky curds, gravy, and fries, though nothing spectacular - but good.  Salty as heck, but poutine always is, and the portion was a good size, so I'd say 4/5.    Burger was phenomenal - that's the only thing that gets a 5/5 here.. Nice and tender, great bun and add-ins.  I'll get the bigger one next time (yes, I'll be back - though not after noon due to service, and will skip the poutine).  A note about service - one of my coworkers ordered poutine and it came with no cheese, so he took it back.  The guy just sprinkled some curds over top instead of making him a new one.  Me being the agitator, I asked the guy to get him a new one, because really, the curds should be in warm gravy to make it right.  He didn't like that but agreed to do it.  Then, he noticed that there *was* cheese in the poutine, just at the very bottom of the container.  The guy who dished it up had held the container upside-down, so when my coworker opened it, everything was buried at the bottom.  The guy behind the counter thought it was my coworker's fault, but uh no - those containers are meant to open only one way - and it was the guy's fault for putting everything into the wrong side of the clamshell to begin with.  Rather than being apologetic, he was obviously miffed.  Not cool guy - in this industry the customer is always right, and in this case, he actually was, so that's a major ding on this place, along with the slow service in general.  Overall it would be a 4/5, but service is taking it down a notch.  I'll be back and will update if things get better (or, yikes.. worse)."}
{"text":"4.5!   It's simple call your place Fresh Burger and it sets the tone.  Everything is made FRESH!  All the patties looks like they were made the morning of and not frozen.  You can even see someone in the back peeling potatoes for their fresh hand cut fries.  The menu is straight forward...burger and fries.  If you are going to make something simple make it fresh and amazing...they succeeded!  See you again guys."}
{"text":"Personally, I'm a fan of simple burgers and this place is doing it right. I had the 4oz fresh burger, which was topped w/ lettuce, cheese, tomato, and homemade sauce. All the toppings were fresh, and the patty was juicy w/ a seared crust. It actually tasted like beef and wasn't greasy at all; I really enjoyed it. Their hand-cut fries were delicious as well and they came in a generous portion.  I don't exactly live close to Fresh Burger, but I'll go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Very juicy tasty burger, I would compare it to the big Kanhoona burger from pulp fiction! Mmmm ! Now that's a tasty burger! I won't be giving the righteous man speech and shooting up the room! Lol"}
{"text":"Bumping the ratings to 5 stars. I come here at least once a weak and I can safely say their service and quality is consistent. You're in for a meaty treat, their burgers are made from fresh ground beef, classic, juicy and cooked to perfection. I know both of the owners who run this place and they are amazing folks, they have other staff for rush hours and they have been pretty quick as well.  Yes they still serve the burgers in paper bag, but honestly it doesn't bother me anymore, or the burger is soo good that i dont mind it lol"}
{"text":"2 hour drive from Barrie was well worth it. Staff and the level of customer service was superb. Burger was juicy and succulent, poutine was on another level. Have to absolutely recommend this place. Have a craving for burgers and fries or your on your cheat day then this spot will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Very good burger, I tried the richmond hill and church street location, both excellent but richmond hill might have the edge. Beef is very fresh and juicy. I would have liked crispier fries but overall the ingredients are high quality and fairly priced."}
{"text":"I highly suggest fresh burger!! I've never had a problem with the quality of their food. It's great to see them cooking everything in front of you. The burgers are high quality beef and their fries compliment the entire combo. I will agree it's a bit pricey for Richmond Hill. If you don't want to go downtown to burger priest or holy chucks this place hits the spot!!"}
{"text":"A good burger to me is your classic toppings that has been around since the dawn of time... lettuce, tomato, onions, ketchup.    Fresh Burger keeps it simple, stupid.   No over exorbitant offering of a million toppings. Just where it counts most and that is the fresh grind daily ground beef.    Having frequented this place and location in the last 2 years, I can honestly say things are consistent.  I've never been disappointed, not even once by the taste.  Fries have been off once or twice, but hey, I'm here for the burger, not the fries.  Best part, I don't have way, way overly greasy hands and feel bloated unlike some other burger joints out there that charge $10 just for the burger alone."}
{"text":"Freshly made Super tasty Burgers.  Excellent!!  After comparing the other big so called burger franchise this one really surprises you and you really see how not only he shows passion when making his burgers but he backs them up with his words and if he felt that his work was not satisfactory he compensate you back but still satisfy his customers and that what really counts. Honest and very friendly people.  I'll be Back!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite burger joint! I love the regular burger and wouldn't change a thing about it. How do they get the crunch around the beef patty, so different and delicious. The fries are so good too. Seems so simple but quality ingredients make the difference."}
{"text":"Fresh and nice staff.  The burgers are great!  I'd write more but I'm tired, just go and try it!"}
{"text":"So I don't know what's been going on with this location lately, but my last experience, food wise, was not good. My burger was over cooked and dry, and the patties were not holding together well. Half way through the sandwich, it feel apart. Also there's absolutely no taste in any of the veggies they put in, and the sauce is minimal.  But the poutine was great. But this is a burger joint, not poutine joint.   Sorry to say, but this was my third and final visit due to this."}
{"text":"Great burger with lots of choices in terms of size. Starts at 4oz and you can get up to 6oz and 8oz which was great. Had good meat flavour, fresh burger and reasonably priced. Would definitely come back next time we have a burger cravings."}
{"text":"First time being here today. Was recommended from a friend. I got their 4oz burger with poutine. It was such a great home made burger would definitely recommend it for others"}
{"text":"Hands down  best burger and fries in downtown T.O 5 stars is for the fact that they give u REAL fries, ol school home made fries! They always make a fresh batch when u place ur order, they give a nice big heaping bag, usually cant finish them. The Burger is always fresh, I order well done and it's still juicy... Staff and owners are always pleasant and friendly, even on New Years day whn they were the only place open at 11pm.   My only suggestion for improvement wld be not to put the fresh sauce directly on the bottom bun, usually I do take out so by the time I open it,  it's a soggy mess and no bun left. (I usually remember to make the request and staff is happy to oblige)"}
{"text":"Simple manu of 4 sizes of burger with fries and a drink if you choose a combo.  Upgrade the fries to a poutine (a Canadian staple). Was not brave enough to try it. Great burger joint and delicious medium well burger."}
{"text":"After looking at the great reviews here, I wanted to try Fresh burger out. It turned out to be amazingly close to my house and I was definitely not disappointed. The bun is perfectly toasted and fluffy. The beef patty was juicy and flavourful without being overly greasy. I just wished they put a bit more of their special sauce because it was so tasty! They also give you a lot of fries, which can be quite filling. However, I am not a big fan of their fries (personal preference). There are also a lot of condiments available.  This little burger joint was packed during lunch hour, but most people do order take out. The menu here is simple but there is a selection of toppings you can add. We did have to wait a good 10-15 mins as everything is made to order."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first I must admit. I drove by many times, curiously snooping them out and each time I would make an excuse to leave - \"It's too empty\" I would say, \"they are obviously closed today, it's Wednesday afternoon\", \"I have to use my MCD coupons\". Well, I took the plunge and never looked back since. The experience was nerve racking but it was all worth it.  These guys serve simple yet quality stuff. Their burgers need no fancy condiments and 800 sauce options to mask the sub-par beef used by other burger joints. Their burgers are simple yet delicious; beefy, juicy and lightly seasoned to perfection."}
{"text":"This is my go to burger place now. Quality beef and fresh ingredients make a juicy and tasty burger. Prices are decent compared to many burger points around. This place is a bit hidden away but I would go here over any other including Burger Priest or Golden Star."}
{"text":"Very mediocre burger. It was juicy, but lacking flavour. Really did need some sort of salt. Malt vinegar tasted watered down. Fries would have been nice if you didn't have to pay for the side mayonnaise/sauce....   Wouldn't necessarily return in the future."}
{"text":"Best burger joint in Richmond Hill! I normally don't like burgers, but absolutely love Fresh Burger. I usually get their poutine too.  They renovated/expanded, so I really appreciate the additional seating."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews for Fresh Burger and thought I'd give it a go.  Thank you reviewers !  Fresh Burger is a great little spot to get a quick and very tasty burger.  Walked up to the place and the patio was pretty much wide open for seating.  There was 2 people inside, one eating and the other waiting for their order.  At first I wasn't thinking this would be too good.  An empty place is not a good sign.  The menu is simple and straightforward.  You pick your burger and if you want fries, or a combo.  Really there isn't much else other than burgers.  I ordered a prime burger and then asked if I could get gravy on the fries, they said of course.  Waited a very short time for my burger to be prepared and then took the bag of fries/gravy and burger outside to eat.  The Burger was fresh, juicy, and good tasting.  Albeit it was falling apart a bit.  The fries with the gravy were smokin' hot !  good fries and very good gravy.   So hot that I think I burnt my tongue.  Finished my fries, cuz I had to let them cool a bit.  And gathered up my trash.  Overall, the staff were very helpful although they looked a bit tired, and I can't say I blame them, it was a hot day and the place has no A/C.  I'd be tired too if I was cooking next to a hot grill with no a/c.  The food was fresh and hot, exactly the way it should be.  The interior of the place does seem a bit run down and a bit disorganized.   I liked the food and I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Can I give them a 6? There's nothing to dislike about this place, from the service to its burger.  $10 for a 4oz burger combo (fries and a pop).  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I had Fresh Burger for the very first time today and really enjoyed it! The burger was made fresh as were the fries. I really enjoyed how it was juicy, not greasy, and how fresh it tasted. It was seasoned just right and I also really like how the edges of the patty had a crisp to it as well. I didn't add any additional toppings and also did not feel like it needed anything else. Simple and delicious! I got the poutine and it was okay. My friend really enjoyed the fries on it's own. Will come back again when I get a craving for burgers!"}
{"text":"It has a great atmosphere , location, and the burger has great flavour. It's almost close to a shake shake burger wit a 5guys fries. I will definitely be back to try more options."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of burgers but I really enjoy this joint. My brother introduced this place to me and I can't get enough of it.  The burgers are perfectly sized and the ratio of bun:beef:cheese is nicely balanced. Magically I don't get itis after eating their burgers which is a big plus. I guess it shows how much less greasy these burgers are compared to most. If you enjoyed burgers from the top joints in the past few years, you'll put Fresh Burger's among the top I'm sure.  Their fries are good as well!  They introduced their PRIME RIB burger near the beginning of their existence and my brother loved it so much he asked the owner, Jacques to keep it on their menu. It's still there!   WARNING: If you try their prime it'll be hard to go back to any other."}
{"text":"Most reasonably-priced freshest burger not only Ontario but in Canada. Bravo to owners Jacques and Nagako for their passion for quality which can be tasted in their daily ground fresh beef, freshly sliced home made fries and home made secret sauce, wow a must try for everyone."}
{"text":"Just finished the meal and it was very mediocre. My husband wanted me to give it one star. My kids thought the poutine were sub par and they NEVER complain about food quality. Though I had a burger craving I was utterly dissatisfied. It is rare for me to regret a meal. But I do at this time and hope I forget the experience quickly. Their menu is limited as you see from the pictures. The meat in the burger was not substantial nor flavourful."}
{"text":"Amazing burger by amazing people. The customer service is top notch and the food is excellent. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Really good beef. The burger is top notch. It would be a 5 star if they would just clean the place. It was early in the day and it was filthy. The condiment bottles had gunk on the top spout and the bottle was greasy. Staff and owner are very friendly."}
{"text":"This Fresh Burger is one everyone raves about, I remember there was an elite event here, sadly I missed it though. The restaurant is located at Leslie and 16th, on Leslie, the south west corner.  The outside looks very plain and simple. However, the inside is very modern and the décor is amazing. I asked the guy if I should get a double or single, just because it was my first time there.   He didn't try to upsell me, he was like, \"honestly, if you're hungry, then go for the double.\" I went for the double. Took a look to the left, since I got a combo. They offer you ONE can of pop ... which is kinda sad considering you pay $14.00 for a combo. But I guess your extra money is really paying for that amazing burger and fries.  I paid by VISA since they don't take American Express and as I tried to tap, there was a tip option. This is something I disliked. This is a fast food joint to some extent. A little classier than fast food, but I'm not sure it merits a tip. If it does, shouldn't McDonald's employees also get tips? This kinda made my eyebrow raise for a second but I got my stuff to go anyways, so I didn't tip, cause they didn't wait on me.  Other than that, the burger tasted amazing. Melted in my mouth and the fries were above average but not amazing enough to rave about.  4/5 would definitely recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Bun was perfectly toasted. Patty is crispy on the outside but juicy and soft inside. Condiments is simple and nice.  Service is ok because we waited a bit long. It's that busy dinner time..,,  Another story was my bf went there with his colleagues on a week day... Their order was all messed up but the owner professionally correct the order and everyone was happy."}
{"text":"4.5 stars! Just had lunch here and it was really good! We had the Freshburger, Primeburger and fries. The burger itself is flavourful, simple and juicy. The way a burger should be. AND it's wrapped so you don't get your hands messy! The fries compliment it so well. Seating area is nice and clean. Service was good. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. In a quiet plaza behind the Shell gas station, it is small with seating for up to maybe 20 people with an open kitchen where you can see everything that is happening with your food. You can call ahead for pick up so that you don't have to wait too long.   Burgers are really good here! The meat is juicy and fresh, could use a bit more salt though but I like things salty. Comes with standard toppings and sauces and premium toppings are $1 extra each.   The poutine is a bit too runny, too much gravy for my taste. But the cheese and gravy is good, could ask for less gravy is you are like me and don't like your fries super soggy and drowning in gravy.  Great burger place for the Markham/Richmond Hill area!"}
{"text":"This small location was hopping at lunch. The small staff run the small kitchen like an assembly line. Prime burger and fries were fantastic. Will definitely be heading back with friends. Prices are reasonable for what you get. Compares well with my favourite (by way of reference, that being Five Guys Burgers)."}
{"text":"I still have a hard time picking between burger priest or fresh burger. In terms in Markham this is my favourite burger. The meat just melts in your mouth. For some reason the double fresh burger tastes way better than the single!"}
{"text":"This is another reason I feel lucky to live in this city. I don't have to drive far to get my burger fix. Thanks to Kris U's review, I added this place on my list of places to try ASAP. It is located in unassuming plaza, I wouldn't have noticed if not for Yelp reviews. Its a clean place, and serve their burgers really fresh. I ordered the prime sirloin burger without the bun. It was perfect. I did not add mustard or relish as I wanted to savor the taste. Perfectly seasoned patties! The fries are good too. Crispy, not oily and just the right saltiness. After that first visit, i came back 5 or 6 times more. I hope my gym trainer doesn't read this.  i also tried their California fries with caramelized onions and sauce. It was pretty close to Inn n Out animal fries. And yes, they will be open in Sundays soon. I can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"Update: We've been back twice since then.  My son is a burger fiend and this has made it to the top of his list.  Visited Fresh Burger yesterday and it was the best decision of the day.  We were heading for sushi when I looked up places close by on Yelp.  Fresh Burger came up.  Kris U's review had us convinced.  Did a U-turn and got us a FreshBurger combo (caramelized onions and mushrooms) and a Primeburger Combo (no extra toppings).  The fries are so good.  Crisp and salted just right.  The burgers are juicy and delicious.  The bun soft and doesn't overwhelm the fillings.  Quick friendly service."}
{"text":"If you are craving burgers this place will satisfy you. They make a decent classic burger - nothing fancy, just delicious juicy burger to satisfy your craving.  They make the burger fresh to order, owning up to the name of the restaurant. You also get an ample portion of fries on the side. I have only gotten the #1 combo which comes with a fresh burger single patty, fries and a drink, which more than fills me up."}
{"text":"The burger buns are grilled yet maintains a very pleasant softness. Patties are juicy and tender, you can tell that they are indeed fresh. The burger is compacted with a nice amount of onions and pickles, you have listing of cheese options to choose from. The burger sauce reminds me of Big Mac sauce which is delicious. Friendly staff is always a plus, would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a good burger."}
{"text":"The menu here is simple and the place is neat.  I ordered the 4 oz freshburger.  They gave me my receipt with the order# and I sat down to text.   Surprisingly, they didn't call my number but instead my burger was placed right in front of me.   It came with lettuce, tomato, cheese and sauce.  The bun was soft and patty was thick, tender and juicy.  The sauce was good and just the right amount.  It was just too yummm!   **Excellent service! **"}
{"text":"The good news is a 2 am you can get a decent burger with fries. I ordered gravy and bacon sides. Taste way.better than a big mac and the.sauce tastes like a gourmet version of it. I think you might as well support local businesses. Gentrification has changed Church and Wellesley st. Please support the community. You can work it off dancing across the st. Nice people work here. I love the double cheese burger with.bacon. Big time. Cute girl works here."}
{"text":"I visited Fresh Burger at a CMYE for dinner.  Boy, isn't it good to be led by the leader to discover the best of the best?  I ordered a regular hamburger that came with cheese, tomato and lettuce ($5).  Oh yeah, the bun was wholesome, soft and bouncy.  The beef was fluffy.  The just-right amount of toppings were fresh.  They have definitely named the company right.    We left around 9pm.  I saw people still coming in.  Don't people always love a good neighbourhood hamburger joint?"}
{"text":"Definitely my place to go to satisfy a burger craving. I usually get combo #1: Freshburger with all the fixings (4 oz beef patty, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and Freshburger sauce), drink, and upgrading the fries to a Poutine (which is fries covered with cheese curds and gravy) or California Fries (which is fries covered with sweet sauteed onions, cheese, and secret sauce). California fries are not featured on the menu but highly recommend it. They recently expanded so there is more seating, but still relatively small. Expect a bit of a wait during prime times."}
{"text":"This place trumps burger priest any day. Fluffy buns, juicy and flavorful patty, and it's not even greasy at all! For once I can enjoy a burger without my entire hand being a mess.  The fries are really good too. Very crispy - the way I like it!"}
{"text":"Expected better from ratings I've seen. Burger was really good, but they all but force you to have what they consider the proper toppings, and there are not many options to choose from.  I generally prefer to have what I like rather than be told what I should get. Fries were just ok."}
{"text":"Gave Fresh Burger Church location a second chance.   I was not disappointed. Since the second chance, i have been back here for more than 10 burgers. So this review is a review after 10 burgers.   Burgers are FRESH as advertised. grilled to perfection, seasoning on point, crispy buns with juicy burger meat, perfect amount of toppings each time. Always get extra sauce, their sauce is amazing.   The lunch special is a steal of a deal, after taxes you get a burger and a drink for a bit under $6."}
{"text":"Still great burgers but there's a ventilation issue there. You'll smell like burgers the rest of the day if you eat there.  I picked up take out and we were shocked at how burger fat stinky my coat was. Something changed here and it's nasty.  You are in an entertainment district. People don't want to smell like cooked animal. Please fix this."}
{"text":"I liked their fries more than the burger, but that could just be because I'm a \"carbivore.\" The burger was juicy, cheesy perfection. Definitely better than Hero Burger or your typical burger joint.  Clean place. Kind owner. Will be back to try their poutine!"}
{"text":"O.M.Gosh! This place beats five guys! And that's hard to do in my book. When we walked in, we were greeted by very friendly staff & we could see them grinding the meat for the hamburgers in the back. It's that fresh! We could also see the potatoes sitting out, waiting to be sliced up. This place is true to its name--fresh. The burger was delicious with a nice sauce on top of it. The fries were crispy & delicious, not too thin or too thick. They were the perfect size & tasted amazing!! It's altogether not very expensive & I can't recommend this place enough!! If you're a burger or fry lover, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Simple and fresh is the best way to describe their burgers.  Fresh burger 4oz $5.29 Prime burger 6 oz $7.10 Poutine $5.99  There was a hint of sweetness in the burger sauce which I liked. The bread was soft and had a nice toasted crunch to it. The beef was so juicy that the juice rolled down my arm as I ate it. Simple ingredients with lettuce, cheese and tomato. The burger was simply awesome.   The poutine was a good size and had good balance of gravy and cheese.  The only reason I give a 4 star and not 5 is because I can only think of one other place that tops this one - Main Street Burger Shoppe"}
{"text":"This place gets a one star because the staff is friendly. Someone needs to clean this place. Has the health department really passed this place? Flavour lacks. Dirty restaurant and bathrooms. Need I say more? Ewww"}
{"text":"Come here for an amazing beef burger that melts in your mouth! Lunch times are super packed but we'll worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to Fresh Burger. I was ravenous after spending my morning at Canada's Wonderland. I was recommended this burger joint through a friend. First impression when I walked in was how clean this restaurant is and how extremely friendly the staff were.  My order: Double Primeburger (12oz) with Poutine, Prime Burger (6oz) with Cali Fries, and Arizona Half Iced Tea & Half Lemonade.  Standard toppings are lettuce, tomato, and their house sauce. Onions and pickles are available on request. Additional toppings ($) include bacon, caramelized onions, sateed jalapenos, and mushrooms on your burger.    Great selection of drinks to choose from. Burgers were made on the spot. Staff checked up on their customers to ensure the order was correct and the quality met their expectations."}
{"text":"Oh Fresh Burger. I pass by you multiple times a week, but never had the opportunity to stop by...until today. I was doing a car test nearby and decided to have lunch here after exhausting the other options around the area.  The menu was certainly not extensive at all. This wasn't that big of an issue for me, even though I tend to prefer extensive menus. Either way, we ordered the #1 combo and the prime burger. They use ground beef for their burgers, which I only realized after looking around the restaurant and seeing the poster on how the burgers are made. They also have a separate board on the more exotic toppings such as provolone cheese, sauteed mushrooms, and sauteed onions...something that I didn't see until after I ordered.  The combo came with fries and a drink, which is mostly canned pop from the side of the restaurant. The fries were okay, a little bit on the soft side in terms of the skin but mushy as well. As for the burger itself, it felt...\"healthy\". There wasn't much of a taste, but I didn't feel thirsty at all after eating it, so in terms of the health level this burger was quite good. However I do wish I tried out the other toppings they have, and more importantly them putting the whole menu in one blackboard.  Service was okay, although one of the chefs rushed his meal so he can have his lunch break, meaning we didn't get our food until around 15 mins later. I wouldn't be too keen on coming back here immediately, but it's not a bad place if you're not into chain restaurants or want a burger that's lower on the sodium scale."}
{"text":"I have been coming here ever since it opened and its $4 burger coupon came in my mail. Ever since then..... Well it's safe to say I am ADDICTED. I seriously can't get enough of this place. The burgers are fresh (no pun intended), juicy and full of flavour. The burger just melts in your mouth, unlike other places where you need two chainsaws to cut through the meat. I also love that they have pre-picked toppings for the original Freshburger so I don't have to go through the hassle of ordering the essentials like cheese, tomato, lettuce and their special sauce. Do not even get me started on their special sauce. Other than the juicy meat, the sauce is probably my favourite part of the burger. The ONLY downside to this place (which isn't even that big of a deal since it's usually not busy when I come) is the limited number of seats. Other than that, I'm not even gonna complain about the 10 minute wait for getting my order because it just shows that my burger is made FRESH and on the spot. I also love that they have an open kitchen so you can see how your burger is made right in front of you. I will stay loyal to freshburger forever!"}
{"text":"I am really, really impressed with Fresh Burger.  We went in on a whim after a day of covering events and I am so glad we did.  These burgers are done on the flat top and are hand-smashed to order. They're then left alone on the griddle to develop a beautiful crust that's to die for. Amazing. The meat is ground in-house and is the perfect blend of meat and fat. Enough for a juicy burger but it's not dripping everywhere. Definitely not a grease-bomb. Nice fresh toppings and a great house sauce.  The buns are great too, often an afterthought at many places but these were obviously picked to complement the patty.   Fries are done properly here. Blanched ahead of time and made to order. Great in a poutine as well. Real cheese curds, of course."}
{"text":"Best burger ever and I hate to say this but even better then in and out in Cali ... So good"}
{"text":"Hands down best poutine in Toronto. Owner is from Quebec so he knows what he is doing.  The burgers are also great, I would suggest them with extra mustard and ketchup though."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a try based on a friend's recommendation, but i found the burger dry and not very flavourful. Value for money didnt seem great. But I guess when youre in the mood for burgers its an ok place to go. I definitely would not get the fries again."}
{"text":"Great place for a burger and fries!  The meat is of great quality and taste and they really do use fresh ingredients!    They recently expanded their seating to accommodate a growing customer base.  Their menu is simple and consists of 4 to 5 items.  I wished more fast food restaurants followed their business model.  It does get busy (especially on a Friday @noon) so arrive early if you can.  My only wish....a larger burger cooking surface so they can cook more burgers simultaneously so the line moves faster on peak periods.  Kudo's to this place!"}
{"text":"Truly is unbelievable how good this burger is! Cooked to perfection with the added touch of their special homemade sauce and whatever other toppings you choose.  Can't say enough good things about this place, but it is easily one of the top burgers in the GTA and should be ranked among the rest of the highly publicized burger spots in the city."}
{"text":"First time experience at Fresh Burger and I was very pleased. We each had a double prime with cheddar cheese, bacon, carmalized onions, sauté jalapeño and all fixings short of mushrooms. It was a great burger and the meat was a standout winner! I would rank this burger as one of my favourite, second only to The Stockyards. That said, I would not hesitate to return and enjoy another. Not the cheapest burger but frankly, I am happy to pay for a good quality burger.   I will give the burger 5 stars with a notation, the bun can use improvement. To be fair though, we did have to take it out and it was at least 15 minutes before we could enjoy, and we did in fact enjoy. Keep up the good work Fresh Burger as you now have a new loyal customer who will preach praises."}
{"text":"Pros: Great burgers  Cons: No variety  I love my self a good burger so I'm always looking around for new burger joints to try.  I found fresh burger through Yelp and I'm very thankful.  Fresh Burger makes a heck of a burger.  If you're looking for a variety though, you're not going to find it.    Fresh burger is like the No Frills of burger joints.  They have their fresh burger which is 4 ounces and their prime burger which is 6 ounces.  They have double version of that burger and that is it.  You can combo then with fries and a drink.  The fries can be turned into a poutine and there are some extras you can pay for to add to the burger.  Burgers come with lettuce, cheese and tomato. You can add onions or pickle optionally.  THAT'S IT.    There's nothing else.  There are no extra toppings like relish, hot peppers etc.  There are no sides like Onion rings, sweet potato fries.  There's no other entrees here to be found.  The lack of any other variety is my only gripe.  So seeing as those 4 burgers are the only thing they do here, you hope they at least do that well.  Fresh burger delivers on that plenty.  The burger was delicious and juicy throughout.  It was excellent start to finish.  The fries you get are a very big portion as well.  I switched one of the fries to a poutine and that was super delicious as well!!    I am a fan of Fresh burger.  If I'm feeling a burger and in the area, I will definitely drop by.  If I have my kids though, I will have to think twice.  They love chicken nugget/fingers and onion rings so I have to find somewhere else if I'm with them.  They don't do much, but what they do they do very well."}
{"text":"Came into Fresh Burger in hopes of eating a decent lunch while I rested my feet and stole wifi from the coffee shop next door.  Fresh Burger has a simple concept which is great; it's a typical burger joing with of course the option to get those amazing Canadian poutine fries. All Burgers Come With Cheese (in Canada they call it Canadian Cheese), Lettuce, Tomato, Freshburger Sauce, and that sauce is pretty amazing.  Extras like: bacon, carmalized onions, mushrooms, Swiss Cheese, ane more are just a dollar (CAD) more.  Completely fammished, I ordered the Double Freshburger which is 2 four ounce patties. Way too much, but of course, I finished it!  The burger was good. The poutine fries were epic as usual. The service was fast. The guys working the restaurant were friendly. You do end up smelling like grease afterwards so don't come here before a date, unless you're date is one of these burgers then you're okay.  Tip: You must, must, must get the poutine fries."}
{"text":"I had heard many good things about this place but found it hard to believe as it looks really plain and boring on the outside.. boy was I wrong!  I was craving a really simple, no frills type of burger and this place totally hit the spot. I love that the menu is so simple... you have 4 options of burgers (4oz, 6oz, 8oz or 12oz burger).. they also have fries/poutine.  I ordered the 4oz Freshburger and it comes with cheese, lettuce, tomato, freshburger sauce, onions and pickles. Other toppings such as bacon and mushrooms can be added at extra cost.  The burger took a good few minutes to make.. but it was absolutely delicious. The burger was juicy and the toppings were fresh. The freshburger sauce reminded me of mac sauce.  The fries were similar to Five Guys.. yum.  Will definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"Best burger. Juicy, simple and yummy!  The staff was very accommodating when I asked them not to add any more salt to my burger and fries. Delicious  Love that they have expanded and added malt vinegar as one of the condiments. Excellent!  Congratulations! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Good place to go if you just want a basic, affordable burger. Place is clean, and staff are friendly. Their fries are good."}
{"text":"I've been to Fresh Burger a few times at the Richmond Hill location so I was pretty surprised when I drove by to see a Fresh Burger open near my house. I'm a fan of their burgers so the Vaughan location holds up pretty well in that regard. Also the menu is very simple and the prices are pretty good for combos compared to a lot of other competing burger joints. Customer service was very friendly as well. I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Earth-shatteringly excellent.  The fries were so delectable; lightly crispy enough to tickle, freshly cut enough to have it's own natural sweetness.  I am non-stop clamouring to everyone I know to come here.  Long gone are the long drives down to (most) other downtown burger joints.  The burger was nice and juicy.  For this price point too, I am utterly befuddled at how people can fork out just as much money for a crappy fast food burger.  Please, you MUST try this place out.  It's in a small spot so I'm afraid it will disappear.  Do NOT let this place disappear.  It MUST stay.  I love it too much.  Please."}
{"text":"Best burger in Richmond hill. Seriously delicious, but expensive. I only wish they would extend their hours of operation."}
{"text":"Always. so. friggin. good. every. time.   That special crisp on the bun, the seasoning of the meat and the seared edges of the handmade beef patty... and that special orangy sauce ohhh lawwwwwddd"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. Everything was very fresh. I had the 4 oz and hubby had the 6 oz and we split an order of fries. I liked the fries better than NY Fries and one order for the two of us was enough as we had mainly gone there for the burgers."}
{"text":"Awesome burger joint beside Tim Hortons at 16 and Leslie!!!!  $13.50 including tax for a 8oz Double Cheese Burger with fries and a can of pop.  They obviously made the burger fresh right in front of you and they use real cheddar cheese. You also have the option of Swiss or Provolone cheese.  The burger was perfectly juicy and perfectly flavourful and not too greasy. The size of the bun was just right.  Would defiantly recommend and come back again."}
{"text":"3.5-4*  Ok, finally was in the area to check this place out!  It's been bookmarked since FOREVER.  Fresh Burger is definitely the right name for this place!  Burgers are reminiscent of In 'N Out, but not really the prices.  A Fresh Burger combo (burger/drink) + upgraded fries to poutine was like $13, including the taxes.  So not cheap and burger, although it was enough for 2 small Asian girls, probably would be considered small for a bigger eater.  Poutine - Quite good and you can tell that fries were fresh cut!  I found the gravy a tad on the salty side, but heck, it's gravy so that wasn't a surprise.    What I didn't quite like was that burgers, despite dining in, came in a paper bag.  What's up with that?  Many burger joints seem to do this!  Paperbags seem to be wasteful especially when they're extraneous.  However, this is just my personal 'beef' about the environment.  Asian female who took my order was very nice.  Even offered me an actual knife to use to cut my burger in half."}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty darn good - it was so fresh (totally goes with the name of the place). So many burger places just go over the top with all these crazy burger toppings. But here they keep it simple and amazingly delicious.  I got a \"4 oz Fresh Burger + Cali Fries (secret menu item). All burgers come with cheese, lettuce tomato and their fresh burger sauce - free onions and pickles are available upon request. I must comment that my burger could have been a lot better if there was a little salt - but it was still pretty damn good regardless of that. The california fries.. omg the cali fries.. sooo gooooooooooood. It's essentially fries, covered in sauteed sweet onions, cheese and their secret sauce (same sauce that's on their burgers). It's so freaking good. You cannot say no to this.  I wanted to try this place for so long ... and after trying it, it made me wish that I had tried it sooner."}
{"text":"So glad I have gotten around to trying this place out. Loved the buns and everything in between. Fries were served barely warm to me which sucks, so next time I'll definitely get the Cali fries or the poutine. I was worried that the 4oz fresh burger wasn't going to be enough; but it was the perfect size for lunch. Next time for dinner I'll try the Angus, or if hungry enough the double patty! So glad there is an authentic burger place in town. Simple is best!"}
{"text":"I am a usual at this place so this review isn't based on a one time go.  Service : ALWAYS quick and they have never messed up my order, ever.  Food : Well, its fresh. As fresh as it gets. I wouldn't be surprised if they had cows in the back waiting to become burgers... Yes, i said it.  Wait time : The place is PACKED at lunch time but the key to this is being organized and these people are organized. Max 4-5 minutes wait.  The poutine : If you like to pig out, grab one with your combo.. The poutine is awesome and im from Montreal so take my word for it. Those damn fries they use, Fresh Fresh fries.   All in All, i cant give this place less than 5 stars because they excel in every area.  Anyways, im out. I just got hungry."}
{"text":"Best burger ever! If any one is in the Richmond Hill area it is a must try. Service is great."}
{"text":"BEST BURGER IN MY LIFE. I have been here a numerous times and never failed to make my mouth water. We get the \"prime burger\" and the \"double prime\" majority of the time as there are only four menu options of burgers. The patty itself is made perfectly, the edging is crisp but not burnt and so succulent on the inside. Toppings like caramelized onions and jalapeños and certain cheeses are a $1.00 extra but basics are included with the burger you order, if you like raw onions make sure to ask for it! Also ask for extra \"special sauce\", It reminds me of In and Out sauce Nom nom!  The fries are fresh cut and double fried. Poutine is also another thing to try here! They know their poutine because the cheese curds are delicious and the gravy is light and smooth (I think it's because they were from Quebec, the best poutine I had was in Quebec, so that is my logic). For those not sure if they want a burger or poutine get both with the \"poutine cheeseburger\". Lovely crispy patty on top of your poutine topped with caramelized onions, sliced cheddar cheese and more gravy and special sauce. Salivating yet?  The prices are reasonable but so worth it! It always busy when we go so seating can be limited. Turn over is quick but a fair share of people take out as well, you do wait for approximately 10mins for your freshly made burger but again it is worth the wait!! Always will be coming back to this family run burger joint!!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Fresh Burger. Unfortunately my first visit we couldn't even get food as it was packed and the place was very small and no seats available. This time they renovations have been completed and we went slightly after the lunch rush to make sure we got to try it. I had the double fresh burger 8oz and the wife got the regular fresh burger. All the burgers come with cheese lettuce tomato and fresh burger sauce. Onion and pickles available at a request. We decided to split a poutine (great idea). The burgers were very fresh. Nice and moist inside and had that nice crisp exterior due to the flat top cooking. The poutine was great. Good amount of cheese curds and lots of gravy!  I will definitely be back. And won't hesitate to recommend to family and friends. Next time I'm trying the Prime burgers! Mmmm my mouth is watering already!"}
{"text":"Love the burgers when they actually cook them. Make sure you aren't eating half raw meat."}
{"text":"Mother of all burgers!!! Never have I ever had anything special to say about regular burgers and fries before I highly recommend this place if you are around the, also recommended you use the online order during lunch hours as their business is thriving during those hours!"}
{"text":"As a 20ish person, i have had a lot of hamburgers but none better than here. The orgasmic experience you get from the freshburger is amazing. I have tried the other burgers on their menu but they are inferior to the freshburger. The perfectly cooked meat and the ratio of veggies in it is spectacular. All that and the burger isn't even that expensive, certainly cheaper than hero burgers.   If you want to get a good burger, go there and see what I mean."}
{"text":"The Best hands down!!! I've come here for 4 years and whenever I'm in the area I make the extra trip to come and have a good meal.... Best in my opinion!"}
{"text":"First off, do not let their name deter you from eating here. I have a theory about restaurant names, which is anyone that named their restaurants with words like \"fresh, tasty, authentic, or yummy\" are probably neither of em'  Finally decided to try this place and got the double burger special. Friendly guy served me at the counter and food came out fast. First bite in, it was delicious! Thick double juicy patties with fresh toppings. Buns were really good, not too soft and so the buns didn't get soggy with all the hamburger juice soaked in. I pretty much inhaled the burger. So glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Pros: - Good sized burger for the price and quality - Lady at the cash was very friendly - Food came out quickly - Different flavours of pop (Pomegranate Sprite)  Cons: - In the middle of nowhere lol - Closes relatively early  Ordered:  $9.75 Fresh Burger Combo w/ Cali Fries(+$3.19) $11.45 Prime Burger Combo w/ Poutine (+$3.19)  Conclusion: Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at Fresh Burger. When we got there, the lady at the cashier was very welcoming and inviting. She recommended that I try the Prime Burger. I'm glad that I ordered the Prime burger. It was very juicy, flavourful and filling. You can tell that the food was very fresh and was made with quality produce. The poutine was also very good. The Cali Fries were a bit too saucy for my liking but still pretty good. I'm a big burger person and I really enjoyed my meal. I would highly recommend Fresh Burger."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out for lunch the other day and I'm quite impressed. I got the 4oz fresh burger with cheese and a poutine.  The burger was really good, kind of reminds me of Burger Priest except less greasy feeling, I only regret not adding caramelized onion and sautéed jalapeños. I will definitely be back:)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Have been coming here since just after opening this location. Very good quality and great tasting burgers. I'd recommend the double prime burger combo."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for a good burger in York Region.  I always get the Fresh Burger and it tastes amazinggggg. The patty is well seasoned, toppings are super fresh and the bun is so nice and soft."}
{"text":"Looks like I've found the new best burger in the burbs. The hamburgers are flavourful, fresh and perfectly cooked. Seared on the flat top, the crisp edges are the perfect juxtaposition to the creamy, gooey cheese and soft bun. The best thing about this place is that the burger is large enough to be satisfying, but doesn't sit heavy. The fresh veggie toppings are simple and effective, and I love the fresh sauce. The fries are also perfectly crisp and tasty. Big fan."}
{"text":"Oh, wow! In a sea of tasteless industrial chains, up pops this little gem. You can actually taste the griddle-smashed patty, and boy does it taste good! No need to pile on the toppings to make it barely palatable, like at Hero Burgers across the street. You can clearly see that it's freshly-made on the spot. The taste and texture are perfect: soft and greasy, just like classic greasy-spoon diners used to make. While I do like most fast-food chains, THIS place has burgers that taste like no other. The husband and I have to be tread carefully if we don't want to find ourselves eating there every other day... Oh, and take the time to read the posted articles on the owner, a former financial analyst who speaks 8 languages. It's a fun read.  This is going to be one swamped patio this summer!  Pro tip: ask for the fries well-done. Although their fries are also wonderful, it really brings out the taste."}
{"text":"The owner runs a tight ship and service was great. As for burger its definitely home made but I just don't know why such a good piece of meat gets grilled on a flat top fryer fried in its own fat when you can grill it on a BBQ. If 5 guys burgers is your thing it's an almost cookie cutter copy.  Jumbo Burger on Runnemede kicks this place's **$ in a major way when it comes to homemade burgers.  Great quality without the wow flavour...unless fried up quality cuts of meat is your thing....and nothing wrong with that...just not for me."}
{"text":"If you wanna satisfy your burger cravings and not settle for those overkill greasy other burger joints, I would highly recommend Fresh Burger.   I came here after not having a burger for quite sometime and I'd have to say it was a pretty darn good tasting burger. I'm used to burgers being super greasy, but fresh Burger proved that wrong! For a decent price of around $10, you get a burger, fries and a drink (combo). Fresh burger patties are well put together, great recipe and sauce. I don't know what's in it, but their secret sauce is bomb! I got the combo and subbed the fries for a poutine. The poutine was pretty good considering the cheese curds and loads of gravy.! The burger was just the right size and includes cheese!!! Bonus!!   Verdict: would definitely come back here to satisfy burger cravings. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to fresh burgers this summer and since then have been there a few times.   This place is a hidden gem! Upon walking in, one will immediately notice it's extremely simplified menu. It makes one wonder, how does this place stay in business with all the other burger joints out there that offer menus filled with endless toppings and burger options. The fact that a friend took me there and wouldn't stop raving about it intriqued me even more.  I order the regular burger and a drink. They ordered the double burger, less than $20 all together. Took a seat and waited about for about 5mins for the food. When I got my burger it looked exactly as the photo on the menu. Buns, slice of lettuce, tomatoe, melted cheese, grilled onions, their house sauce and thick piece of beef patty. I took the first bite and was blown away! Their ingenious is definitely in the simplicity of their burgers. Perfectly grounded and juicy, with each bite the beef patty was so tender it would crumble and melt in your mouth. The buns were soft and not doughy. There were no crazy toppings to mask the flavour the burger. The burger was hearty but not heavy or greasy. You could easily eat two or more of their burgers in one sitting or eat there few times a week without feeling sick or unhealthy about yourself.  They are definitely one of the top burger joints! I definitely think their burger patties beats preists' by miles!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh Burger is a burger joint that originated in Richmond Hill. They recently opened their Toronto location on Black Friday and gave away free burgers as part of their grand opening.  I had the opportunity to preview the new restaurant before it was opened to a line of hungry people. Fresh Burger puts emphases on their quality premium meats. You can order your burger based on how much meat you want along with additional toppings. If you want poutine instead of fries, you can upgrade it for $2.99 in a combo.  The menu is kept to a minimum because their sole focus is the Canada AAA sirloin served. As someone who likes to order interesting items off the menu, their menu did not stand out to me because of the limited choices. I tried their Freshburger and it tasted like any standard burger. It's typical comfort food but made fresh on the grill every time, which I like. Fresh Burger is for people who love the classic burger and want to eat it fresh. No frills, no fuss."}
{"text":"If you are looking for simple, delicious burgers, this is the place!  I ordered the standard Fresh Burger, which was made on site in front of me. The burger was delicious and juicy, and was definetly made with quality ingrediants. Service was great and staff were very friendly. The owner has a really interesting backstory.  Just note, the portion size is a tad small. If you're coming for lunch or dinner, I recommend getting the larger burgers and/or sides. Also, with toppings, the burgers can get a tad pricy, but still well worth it.  Overall, I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a burger fix."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews for this burger joint and decided to check it out myself. I came near the end of the lunch rush but the small place was still pretty packed (not many seats/tables were available).   Got their 4oz fresh burger (and asked for pickles and onions) and it was good. I was satisfied but it wasn't life changing or anything...It was a regular burger that was well made.   But after I went home, and the day after my visit, I could NOT STOP THINKING ABOUT THAT BURGER! It was juicy, it was meaty, the right amount of toppings, the fries were good. It was a classic burger that was made REALLY well. I'm coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger. Not too saucy, process cheese surprisingly paired well with the beef, not too greasy, and beef was tender but not as juicy as I would've preferred."}
{"text":"The best burger in town! It is a pricey burger similar to five guys but it really is fresh here. I get the fresh burger with the sautéed jalapeños...really amazing!!"}
{"text":"With the increase in prices, I'd rather get Five Guys or South Street Burger. Or Drive to Holy Chuck.  Before, the prices were reasonable, Now, they have priced themselves out of the getting good value for my money category.  Bad marketing plan in my opinion. They may do well in Richmond Hill due to limited options, but downtown where the options are abundant., they won't last."}
{"text":"Great burger place. Really is \"fresh\" and surprisingly filling but it could also me my small appetite. Go to is the simple burger, no combo for a quick lunch. Quick service. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Fresh Burger is by far the best burger joint you can come across in the area! They grind their beef on site every day, so it's as fresh as it can and should be :) it's no Burger Priest, but for the area it's worth a trip!  I'm a fan of their burger, but not so much for their fries (quite oily and lack of season when I had it).  Their service was also good and the staff was friendly, but the parking lot can be a bit busy, so be patient when looking for a spot to park."}
{"text":"The burger was average, the patty was good but the whole burger itself is just average. I think everyone hyped it up that I had too much expectation going in. The cost is average, I think A&W is kind of better. The fries were good though."}
{"text":"A nice burger joint with alot of seating and friendly service. It was quite busy at lunch on a Friday.  I tried the 4oz burger plus onions and was a little underwhelmed. I think the patty was overdone and didn't have the juicy greasiness I tend to enjoy with burgers. Maybe it was lean meat. It was definitely fresh and simple if that's your thing you will enjoy it.  Also had the poutine because it's Friday so gotta go crazy and it was not bad. The cheese curds were really good, and the fries are seasoned well, but wasn't a huge fan of the gravy. Felt like it had a slight funky flavour.  Overall based on the price and leaness of the patty I think I would opt for other fast food like A&W."}
{"text":"Every pattie cooked with care, good quality meat, delicious special sauce, and very reasonably priced menu!"}
{"text":"I've been to Fresh Burger twice now in the past year. It's a surprisingly good place, given that the plaza is pretty well-hidden in this part of Richmond Hill. The first time I was here, I ordered the 4oz. Freshburger meal ($9.75+tax), the second time I ordered the Double Freshburger meal ($12.39+tax). There's a steady stream of customers around dinner time and seating was enough to accommodate all guests.  I feel the burgers themselves are good, but the patties are a bit thin and don't release a strong umami taste. The combination of ingredients works well, but I don't get that euphoric feeling of biting into a burger like at other restaurants. However, they don't add too much sodium to the burger, so I'm not left with that cottonmouth feeling later on.   You get a can of soft drink and fries if you purchase the meal option. The can of drink is okay, though it would've been better if they had fountain drinks to get more beverage. The fries are good and not overly salty so you can add your own seasoning, vinegar, or other condiments to your preference. You're definitely full at the end and get good value for what you pay."}
{"text":"Burger was cooked to perfection. Good quality meat. Very tasty. Good bang for the buck then most burger joints  I will come back!"}
{"text":"Burgers were guite good, actually very good. However, for the price that you pay (7.99 for the combo), I'd rather go to Hero burgers because there are a lot more toppings that you can add to your burger at no extra charge. The burgers on the website look like they include a slice of red onion and pickle, but when you order the burger you get a piece of iceberg lettuce and a tomato. Slightly disappointing!  But the burger was tasty no doubt. Just don't cheap out on the toppings and I will be satisfied."}
{"text":"Fresh burger was good but their service was really slow.  I had the prime burger and it was delicious!  I do hope they focus more on in store customers more than mobile orders."}
{"text":"Fresh and simple.  The owner Jacque is quite passionate about his burgers that he lives and breaths burgers all day long.  It's not as fancy as Burger Priest but if you want just a good tasting burger, Fresh burger is the place to go.  No fillers and daily grounded beef ensures that you get the best tasting burger that your mouth can handle.  If any can compare this with Hero burger, they must have went to Freshco and ate some burgers from the frozen section that's been in the freezer for over a year.  Double prime burger was flavourful and juicy, but I had to forgo the fries to make room for the extra 6oz patty going into my stomach.  Best burger uptown!"}
{"text":"Upon reading the raving rewiews from our awesome CM, Kris U and Yelp superstar Jennifer K, I trusted their taste and decided to give this place a go.   Beef patties were prefectly seasoned and grilled to perfection, not overly dry.. just the way I like it.  Ingredients were fresh like they promised, but the selections for burgers and toppings are very limited. Toppings included only lettuce, tomato, and processed cheese.  Although this is a heavy burger, you wont feel greasy heart burn after eating one!  :D   They have 2 different patties with 4 combo selections on the menu. Considering all good joints are downtown, this is as good as it gets in Markham Richmond Hill area.   This is definitely my go-to spot if i'm craving a burger uptown."}
{"text":"I like how Fresh Burger is keeping everything simple and try to do one thing really well..  Burger!  I love how my freshly grind daily in store from AAA Sirloin burger was cooked perfectly. Cooked through with no pink but still juicy and moist inside. The bun was nothing fancy, but the toppings were all fresh and I can tell that my burger was cooked to order with care!  $7.99 combo includes Hamburger with Cheese, Fries and Pop, which is really reasonable.   The fries though was freshly cut but was a little over cooked.   Give Fresh Burger a try if you are in the area. A small owner/chef burger joint that still passionate about the food they serves!"}
{"text":"Damn, you want a good burger? This place has it, plain and simple. I found how it was all the rave here on yelp, and since its close to my work, I decided to go for it for lunch. They are relatively basic burgers--cheese, meat, lettuce, tomato, special sauce. There is nothing special to them inherently, but they are made right and are delicious. They won't fall apart on you, they're not too big that you are eating the top or bottom only, they're just right. The fries are standard fresh cut, deep fried and salted just right.  These guys are the standard for basic cheeseburgers. Only downer was they were out of pickles today."}
{"text":"The Canadian version of In n Out. Love this place. The burgers are awesome and so are the fries."}
{"text":"This is a great burger joint. The balance of meat and bun is perfect.  Just enough fat juicy beef that you an still taste the soft toasted bun.   Definitely one of the best burger in the Richmond Hill/markham area.    The place is super clean which is a nice bonus.  Oh and the ventilation system is pretty good you don't smell like beef after going to the shop.  I think I still smelled a little beefy but I assume that was my beef sweats from the double burger I had :P"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good - the beef was the real McCoy - tasted freshly ground. Fresh toppings too... fries were great. Best burger I've tasted in Richmond hill. I will be back for sure! Don't judge the place until you've tasted it. Classic burger with great flavour. Nothing too exotic. Good cheese and special sauce. Crisp onions. Tangy pickles ... ohhh yeah it's burger time"}
{"text":"What can I say? Good fries, good burger for a decent price. Mine was $10--I did the special with a drink.   Decent price for lunch and they are always hustling in the back to keep cranking out the burgers. I would come back here when in town and needing a quick lunch.   Friends at the table weren't fans of the poutine, but I guess soggy fries are an acquired taste."}
{"text":"It's good burger place but a bit over rated.  With not much A/C in the store in hot summer day getting take-out is a must."}
{"text":"This small burger joint located on Leslie just south of 16th is your go-to mom and pop burger joint. The color theme of the place reminds me of Carl Jr's or in-and-out burger. I ordered the run-of-the-mill hamburger combo with a side of poutine. The poutine was good, but not to die for. Could have done without but who doesn't want  poutine when it's an option?! The burger was good, the party was not too oily which is one of my peeves with burger joints. The burger bun was remarkably soft which is one of the highlights.  Verdict: would go again if I'm in the area and in the mood for a burger."}
{"text":"I love this place! Definitely fresh burgers. Good quality bread/buns too, which is just as important to me. I would pick this place over McDonald's, Harvey's or any other fast food place. Their poutine is delicious, melted cheese curds with gravy, can't go wrong. After upgrading to a poutine for my combo, I was unable to finish everything. Good portions. Of course, it takes little longer to make than a McDonald's burger for example, but it is worth the wait. If I wanted a crappy fast burger, I'd go to McDonald's... but I don't, so I will wait."}
{"text":"Fresh burger offers some great food, with a fairly straightforward menu. I've had pretty much all of their food here and i've never ever been disappointed. They also have a great selection of soft drinks [some that I've never seen before.. Like Barq's brand cream soda which is fantastic by the way]. The staff is always super friendly as well. I've even ordered online and put burger puns in the comments, and they were even nice enough to reciprocate and have a good laugh. 10/10 would recommend, I dare say i even like this place better than burger priest [and it's more affordable too!]"}
{"text":"I heard many good things about Fresh Burger from friends and have been meaning to visit the Richmond Hill location. I was excited to hear that they opened up a location in Vaughan. I visited this location on a Friday evening. It was not busy at all and the staff was just starting to clean up for the long weekend. Service was courteous and friendly.  I ordered the double Fresh Burger with fries. With the Yelp check-in offer, I was able to upgrade to a poutine for free (usually $3.19). The burger was made to order. It was certainly fresh. The beef was very juicy and soft, but was solid enough that it didn't fall apart. The melted cheese added to an already flavorful and savory burger. The burger comes with a fresh slice of tomato and a fresh lettuce leaf.  I wasn't a fan of poutine in the past, but the poutine at Fresh Burger was excellent. The first thing I noticed was the savory gravy. Next was how soft the melted cheese was. Simple yet delicious."}
{"text":"Food so great it motivated me to leave my first Yelp review! In short, its a MUST EAT if you live in toronto/GTA and you ever loved \"IN N' OUT\" in U.S! The burger is so fresh, juicy, not too thick or thin and the sauce is so amazing that preserves the original taste while offering a kick. Oh I'm Drooling already... They even have their own take on animal fries, called california fries. Have yet to try it. Everything is made fresh on premises.  All I got to say is im impressed and glad I dont live in the area or I would've been fat in no time!  WARNING: after this food, you wont be looking at burger and fries the same way and cant step into another junk fast food burger joint.  I just hope to dear God they keep the quality as they grow bigger in size and the fan base."}
{"text":"Update: they recently renovated and did a wonderful job! More seating and a nice look and courtesy scheme. Great job! Still the best burger in town!"}
{"text":"I WAS NOT IN THE MOOD FOR A BURGER....so where did I end up? You got it! Fresh Burger in Vaughan (It's a long story).  Walked into this newly minted location, located across the street from Vaughan Mills, on the north side. This location was nestled in an unsuspecting strip mall next to a Coppa's supermarket and not easily seen from the road.   Walked in, it was quiet (8:ish pm). I found it nicely laid out and very clean. We walked up to the counter to order and Zal behind the counter explained the menu and choices to us as if it was his first time doing this, his enthusiasm was infectious. I just wanted some fries maybe a poutine, but Zal's enthusiasm made me want to try more so we all ended up ordering burgers fries and poutine, hell, I was not in the mood for a burger remember.   The food was cooked up in a jiffy, and first bites were amazing! I finally found a franchise that can cook up a...well....Fresh tasting Burger!! The fries where also very good and made from real potatoes. I later found out that Zal was co-owner and he informed me that the fries were made Belgium style (re-fried to ensure crispness) thus explaining why my poutine was soooo good and not soggy. If for some reason you are not in the mood for a burger, give FB a try, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"The food at fresh burger is delicious and I love how I can get multiple patties in a single burger, however I don't think that it is worth what you pay for. The patties in the burgers sometimes crumble when you eat the burger and crumbley meat doesn't really appeal to me. This place is a once and awhile place at best, but the way they market themselves and their food is superb. Eat well friends!"}
{"text":"Service is sloooooooow........ I get that the place is popular, but we waited for a long time for the burgers. The burgers are good one you get them after the long wait."}
{"text":"Best service quick and easy. Menu is perfect and the taste of quality of the meat is 100% best burger place in Canada hands down I can't wait for those fry's either if you are in the areas you as a tourist you can't leave the city with out trying Fresh Burger !!"}
{"text":"First time at Fresh Burger today. Burger was amazing. Definitely more of a homemade burger than processed fast food burger  fries were okay - not amazing but not bad. My 9year old who has only recently opened up to eating burgers at new places loved the 4oz with cheese and ketchup but did not care for the fries. Nice atmosphere place well lit and has lots of big front windows."}
{"text":"Found some fresh new coworkers that were raving about \"amazing\" burgers here. I was a little hesitant as I am not a burger guy but I have to say it's really cool here.   From what I quickly saw, most of it came in a combo form of a burger, drink (that you grab from the fridge), and fries. It was a small wait; it wasn't packed but my coworker warned me that when it gets busy, it could be a while as everything is made to order. Hence: fresh.  When we grabbed our little baggies, we headed back and I took a bite. It's a really good burger. You can feel the freshness and I enjoyed it. I was not really hungry, so I couldn't even finish my fries. They aren't the best I've ever had, but definitely are the tip of the iceberg to fill you up.  Good place to get a good burger. 4/5."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late 2pm lunch, restaurant was extremely clean and surprising empty, I guess I missed the lunch crowd.  Ordered the prime burger which was recommended  by the staff member waiting at the register. Combo comes with anything from the open refrigerator and a order of fries.  Back ground music was clean and easy to hear, I hate listening to static. The burger had a little too much salt for me but it was still delicious and the jalapeño added just enough heat to satisfy my pallet.  Fries were fresh and hot.  Will probably return because of the close proximity to my commute."}
{"text":"reasonable price and nice burger. much better compared to slab burger..."}
{"text":"Really great burgers!! The meat is crisped perfectly but still very juicy. I'd say this would be the best place to go get a classic burger! Its my go to place for a burger fix, been here about 3 times now, mainly because it's far away from where I live. For what this place is they deliver quality food!"}
{"text":"I want to say I love this place but the agonizing pain and hour long in the bathroom prevents me from doing so.   First bite into the burger and I'm in heaven. The buns are so soft, it feels like I'm touching silk and the meat is so tender and fresh, it was literally melting in my mouth.   Unfortunately, that's where it goes bad. Digging deeper into my meal, I realized the middle section wasn't fully cooked. Meat was still fleshly pink and three hours down the road, I'm dying on the toilet.   Upgraded fries to poutine. It was good but would've been fantastic if the gravy wasn't so salty. Felt like I was downing on all that salt content.   Overall I think I'll come back but making note to remind my patty flipper to leave my patty on the grill a little longer."}
{"text":"Fresh Burger delivered. Very fresh, no frills burger. I got a 2-1 coupon in the mail and decided to try it out. Clever advertising as I never visited the acme burger that was there previously. It was AH-mazing. There wasn't anything too special about the burger, but it's just what Toronto needs. I opted the extra 2.99 to try the Poutine, fantastic. The burger was delicious and I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Burger Binge Week review: 6oz Prime Burger  In the south west corner of 16th and Leslie just south of the gas station is a small plaza where this place was.  The owner I guess says that if I wasn't satisfied that I didn't have to pay for the burger.  Personally I wasn't 100% satisfied.  The patties though good, is just taste pan fried and it didn't have any fragrance.  The bun was not toasted either so it was a bit mushy.  So overall, I wasn't too satisfied.  However, it wasn't blatantly bad so I won't call on the challenge for the burger because it isn't fair anyway.    In fact we had three burgers.  Primarily because we were too tired to go anywhere else and I had to take one home for my wife.  The first one we got medium rare. Second one was medium rare with onions. Third one was well done.  So we did try different variants.  Unfortunately, they were all relatively blah.  The price is relatively fair, but I don't think I would think go back again, it wasn't anything special for me."}
{"text":"I love, love, LOVE Fresh Burger, and I'm not much of a burger person. Before I had Fresh Burger, my favourite burger place was Shake Shack. Now, it's a tie!  It's pretty close to my workplace and I love the convenience of it. I can order online or through the app, customize my burger, and pay through my credit card. I also love that they show you the status of your order during the entire duration from when you're in line, to when it's being prepped, to when it's ready for pick up. I can quickly grab our offices' order and head back with minimal lunch time lost.  If I'm dining in, I'll usually grab a thai iced tea from Nam next door. The burgers did go up in price from what I remember but it's 100% worth it. They are the perfect thickness and texture. So juicy! My go-to order is the 4oz fresh burger (add onions, bacon, and no cheese). The bacon is deliciously crispy! The fresh sauce brings everything together. I'm already craving for another one just by writing this review. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Walked in today with 2 buddies around 6:20. First time trying this place for all 3 of us. The owner was present and he runs a tight ship.   We each ordered the double burger with fries, one buddy got the poutine for $3 extra.   The burgers - really good. Exceeded my expectations. They were fresh, juicy, melt in your mouth. You could tell they were hand made fresh. The burger was falling into pieces because of the real minced meat that was used to produce it. Buns were soft and chewy, as they should be, real burger joints don't toast their buns.   The fries - pretty good, but I've had better. They were fresh cut and definitely blanched/double fried. The centre was soft and moist, outer shell of the fries were nice and crispy. Perfect combo.   Poutine - relatively small. But when you pair with it with a double burger, it's quite the feast. The gravy was freshly made, paired with real cheese curds. They were however not melted.   The joint - also relatively small. About 10 little tables with chairs, little high top bench by the window good for 2 people. A/C is non-existent, but I did see a sign saying they're in the process of fixing it.   All in all, nailed it. Wasn't perfect, but again, exceeded my expectations.   Would I return? Absolutely. Would also definitely recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Only ordered the Fresh Burger to get a sense of how the food was. After devouring it like I haven't eaten in a few days, it's easy for me to say I will be back to try more of their options like the Prime Burger. The first thing I noticed was the gentle crisp on the toasted bun which had no sesame seeds on it (personal preference but I don't like buns with seeds on em). The patty was fresh as the name suggests and there was plentiful of cheese. However, the portion size was not the greatest. As a light eater, I was not close to full after finishing the burger, but that's my fault for ordering the cheapest burger they served. I think the prices are still quite reasonable in comparison to other burger joints and I am very willing to pay for higher quality food than settle for garbage like *cough*, McD's. Service was quick and friendly. Double thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"I saw all the hype on the social sites and ratings and the family has gone there about a handful of times. I personally don't see what it's all about. The meat is done fresh - nice. The bun (which is a standard package one) is toasted on the grill - not nice. The burgers come with cheese - processed, I believe. They charge for the good toppings - mushroom, fried onions, and others. The fresh meat is fatty and they do try to drain in before they put it on the bun - but still leaves quite a large deposit on the wax paper when you finish the meal. The fries are fine and their version of the poutine is ok. I have seen them busy off and on and they seem to be doing ok the last time I was there - which was a little while ago. If you like burgers (who really doesn't), the place is worth a try. Who knows, it might ring your bells more than it did mine. The owner has a good story behind his reason to enter the competitive burger landscape and I wish him all the best."}
{"text":"Been seeing this all over social media a while back and tonight I was in the mood for meat so I stopped in. It can be summarized as -love the burger hate the fries.  Location: 16th and Leslie on an awkward plaza with a Tims  in it.  Decor:  Nicer  than I expected. Clean. But it was the guy at the cash who sweeps and wipes tables. When he's busy it doesn't happen until there's a lull in customers. But it's honestly cleaner than almost all places I've been to in the neighbourhood!  Parking: Awkward. It's a right in and right out. Shares parking with a few other businesses including tims. So parking can be tough if everything is busy  Staff:  So nice. The guy at the cash seems really fun. Perfect person to have there and the woman handing out the food to customers seemed super sweet.  Food: You have two burgers to choose from the fresh burger and the prime  burger. You can also get them as doubles. Fries. Poutine.  Thy burgers come with cheese, tomatoes and lettuce.  I got the prime burger with mushrooms ($1 extra) and loved it. Kinda fatty (but not so bad that it ran all over the place the prime must have less fat) burger so it was juicy and full of flavour.  Hated the fries. Got them fresh from the deep frier but they were weirdly tough on the outside, not hard but tough. Hard to describe. Not how I like them but taste varies with everyone. They would probably be awesome poutine fries!  Conclusion:  I'd come back. I might just buy a burger tho not the fries. Mmmm"}
{"text":"Tried this place pretty recently after seeing it come up on Yelp so many times. It's close to my house and had good reviews and im always down to try a new burger joint! I ordered their basic 6oz burger combo. They have no special toppings just your typical lettuce tomato etc  The staff were very friendly but the burgers took kind of long to make. Nice to know they're making them fresh but come on!  The burger was good but honestly nothing to write home about. Kind of tasted like a Big Mac to be honest! Similar tasting sauce. The fries were okay.  I think I'd come back here and give it another shot but im definitely more eager to try other fancy burger places that put crazy things in their burgers like eggs!"}
{"text":"Finally a hand made burger for an affordable price. I didn't have to wait an eternity for my order. It was mega tasty and delivered with a smile.   One more star would have been given if I could have bought Juice or Vitamin Water instead of Pop or bottled tap water.   Still, a must try. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Burger was alright compared to other burger places in GTA, but would consider it slightly above average if comparing to fast food chains like McDonald's/etc.  Found the burger itself to be a bit plain tasting. Either more salt or better cut of beef with maybe more fat in it... for me if it's an amazing burger I can instantly taste that delicious fatty and beefy flavours with each bite but can't say I found that here.  Fries were meh for me.  Overall average rating BUT if you are craving burgers and in the area it's an okay pit stop.   Place was clean, service wasn't too slow, prices are good."}
{"text":"I love this place! A friend brought me here and I will definitely be coming back. I had the 4oz freshburger and just like the title implies it is indeed one of the freshest and best tasting burgers I have ever had."}
