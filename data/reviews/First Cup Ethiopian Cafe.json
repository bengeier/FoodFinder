{"text":"Came here with a group of 10 earlier this month. None of us were familiar with Ethiopian cuisine. We shared 4 different meals. The portions are prepared family style. Everything was delicious!! We all were crazy about the lamb. Good and friendly service, I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and friendly staff! Located close to downtown and the I-17 its a perfect spot to stop and grab a cup."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating Ethiopian food and it was delicious. We had everything on the menu because we went as a big group and shared our meals. My favorite was the lamb and the spicy lentil. But honestly everything was tasty! I will go back."}
{"text":"The food is great very very tasty! It's a husband & wife who own this place they're very friendly and they make you feel welcome. The Tibbs shiro vegetarian combo kitfo qunta firfir are really really  good. If this place upgraded their interior design they could really be popular in the Phoenix area. One other thing they need to remove all plates from the table once people are done eating."}
