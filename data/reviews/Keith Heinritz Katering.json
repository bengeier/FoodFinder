{"text":"Probably the best fish I've ever eaten, PERIOD!!!! Local gem without a doubt. Be patient when attempting to park, because most of the time you can't fine a spot because it's usually a packed house,  it's worth the wait (which is short). Get the \"small sandwich\" because the large is enough for 2 meals. No toppings need on this sandwich only Keith's homemade hot sauce, if you can handle it!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty, huge sandwich, working mans atmosphere, good service. parking on street. Ideal for quick lunch that is a sit down Enough fish to make two sandwiches."}
{"text":"The fish is the best and so are the people.
Come hungry and, still, you might be taking leftovers home!
Our favorite place for fish...EVER."}
{"text":"I'll probably never order from here again! U called and placed my order picked it up at the time they said. I walked in and a lady with red hair I'd say in her 50's is working swearing loud enough you could hear it outside, she had a mouth worse than a trucker. Then I get home to eat and my macaroni and halushiki were ice cold. All the did was pull it from the fridge and throw it in a bag."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place just a local place in Trafford. Hands down the best fish dinner and fish sandwich in the Pittsburgh area. Also love the Mac n cheese. A true diamond in the rough!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good fish, we had a bad young waitress. Never really paid attention too our table. She actually avoided us. Even though we spoke with both owners. Would have another star if our waitress was better."}
{"text":"This place has one redeeming quality, seriously just one.  The fish sandwich is legit.  But the owner and the restaurant, quite bad.  I alluded to the proprietor of this establishment in relation to the \"Soup Nazi\" from Seinfeld, however that might be too harsh a comparison, for the Soup Nazi that is.

The good.  Fish is huge, lightly battered, HUGE, and wait for it...Seasoned.  It's not too greasy either.  Definitely one of the best I have had.  Many people rave about the hot sauce.  I could take it or leave it.  Everyone I know that eats here loves it, but to me it has the consistency (and color) of a duck sauce packet at a Chinese takeout restaurant with some chopped and possibly pickled as they are softer but not cooked, onions slightly spicy peppers and some seasoning.  I think I can almost replicate it.  It hardly classifies as hot sauce to me, lacking the first descriptive word in the phrase itself \"hot\".  Also they only provide you with enough to use on maybe a quarter of your meal.  Up to recently they would not sell any additional cups of sauce!  They are only small souffl√© cups of 2 oz portions but nope.  However, now you can buy them for a mere .70 cents.  The bun they use is ridiculous, but I am fine with that.  I tend to ignore the bread on a nice fish sandwich.   You can order additional buns, also at an exaggerated price of .70 cents.  These are the kind of buns you can buy a bag at the grocery store for under $1.00 so if you're getting takeout I would just buy it elsewhere.  

Now the size of the sandwich is unmatched.  It can feed two adults to the point of being stuffed.  It could probably feed three people nicely, hence the attraction of buying additional buns.  The flavor is awesome and the crunch and crust just perfect.  

Now the not so good.  The place is a complete dive.  Not a charming dive, a grease pit, smelly, sticky, restaurant that really, really needs some TLC.  It appears it hasn't been cleaned in decades.  Another not so charming thing about the establishment is the owners.  They have no qualms telling you no even for reasonable requests without having a understandable reason.  Point in case.  Me and 3 co-workers head here for lunch.  One co-worker calls ahead so meal is ready when we arrive not cutting into our lunch hour.  Upon arrival we say who we are at the counter and they start packing up our food.  My co-worker said oh we want to eat here since we all drove there.  The answer is NO.  You called ahead you take to go.  I looked at my co-worker and asked \"is he serious?\"  He just nodded and said let it go.  HA!  Hence the Soup Nazi comment.  So instead of letting us eat there where we would have undoubtedly purchased drinks, maybe a side or two we were booted out of the empty restaurant for the crime of calling ahead.  A few weeks later I was in the area at another retailer and asked this proprietor if he knows the restaurant and owners and what's up with them.  He first said \"best fish sandwich around.\"  I said yes but what's up with them?  He says \"you think the man's bad the wife is worse.\"  He went on to tell me that they are so popular they couldn't care less about being professional or polite to customers because if someone gets that upset about the service well move over because there is someone behind you ready to take their place.  He also said that once someone called in a takeout order for salad (BTW they don't serve salads) and the person taking the call told the customer to F off, and hung up.  See Soup Nazi in the dictionary for further explanation.

Still a damn good fish. The fish alone is 5 stars.  I'll be back.  Cash only."}
{"text":"amazing fish sandwich !! homemade hot sauce is splendid as well !!"}
{"text":"This place was as disgusting as it gets. The gentleman who brought me my take-out meal looked as if he didn't bathe in eight years. One of the workers was smoking a cigarette out on the front steps as I was trying to walk in with my two young children. She was missing approximately 8 to 10 teeth. The cooking items inside looked dirty as ever. 
 
To top it off, they do not accept debit or credit cards. They don't tell you that of course. So, when I arrived at the place I had to go back into my car drive around town and find an ATM in order to pay for my meal that they already cooked.

The 16 year old cooking the fish had purple hair with some rock band shirt with no sleeves. If the health department went in this place they'd have a field day. It would be condemned within minutes. My fish sandwich platter came with 2 sides. It set me back 20 dollars. The fish was ok. Id give it a 6 or 7.  I wont be back for sure.  Gross."}
{"text":"TOP NOTCH FISH SANDWICH!

I have tried hundreds of fried fish sandwiches, HEINRITZ is near or at the top! Little know secret, they have more than fish. Great place for lunch for a quick combination sandwich!

THE BOMB HOT SAUCE!!! Keith makes homemade!

{"text":"Went for lunch today. Not busy a few people inside. 
The place is worn and dated. The food however is very good. Had a fish sandwich with wedding soup, coleslaw and Hakuseki. Fish and sides are very large enough for two. Suggest half sandwich unless you are very hungry. Would return for great fish and to try other menu items. Friendly staff and owner. Prices are low quality is high"}
{"text":"I am happy to be the first reviewer of Keith Heinritz Catering.  This is the place to come for incredible fish sandwiches on the east side of Pittsburgh.  Don't be alarmed by the \"hole in the wall\" appearance from the outside because the inside is the same (ha ha).  This is a pretty clean place for the high volume of activity going on here.  If you order a large fish sandwich - it is enough to feed 2 people (but you may want to get an extra bun or 2).  The krinkle cut fries and clam chowder soup are also very good.

What makes the fish so good?  Very good light breading but most importantly - extremely fresh tasting big chunks of perfectly fried fish.  The big hunks of fish tend to fall apart when you eat it.  Not greasy like some fish fries.  No sign of a bad or old taste to the oil and fried stuff despite the long line and high volume.  Perfect and yummy.  They have about 7 or 8 workers swarming in the little kitchen and they seem to be serving it up fresh with minimal wait.

A few more important notes - CASH ONLY.  If you want to go on a Friday in Lent, you should consider ordering and picking up before 5:00pm to avoid the longer lines.  There are some tables in here but most people take out.  These folks are the experts - much better fried fish than that church basement down the road (please don't tell the priest or pastor that I said that).  Give this place a try."}
{"text":"This is a 10 star fish sandwich in a 3 star establishment manned by a 2 star staff. 

You don't get greeted when you enter, they just yell out names of to-go orders. 

No chit chat, no pleasantries, cash only.  

But it's the price you pay for a fish sandwich that will feed you 3X and comes with the best hot sauce, ever.

So place your order, shout out your name, pay your money and enjoy your sandwich.  But if you need some love, call your mom on the way home, cause you won't get it here."}
{"text":"Good fish sammy. The end. Enormous portions. Be sure to get extra buns. One sandwich can feed three people. Hot sauce is delightful. I am a serious coleslaw snob but this stuff is beyond delish. The halushki is good as well as mac and cheese. Bring your money because debit/credit cards are taboo. They ate not superstars when it comes to customer service, true. But the food is worth it. There were \"keiths\" tee shorts hanging on the wall. I inquired about purchasing one being from out of town. The guy, who was wearing one, confirmed that they do sell them. However, they were somewhere because someone moved them. Needless to say, I didnt get one.   I may be the only person interested in that tee shirt ever. :). Missed sale. But the fish was good."}
