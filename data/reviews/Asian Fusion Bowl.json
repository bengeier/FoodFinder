{"text":"The food was delicious! Clearly different and better than regular Chinese food. I could taste the freshness and lack of additives. Great job guy! 
The only thing I'd like to see improve is the quantity of oil you use. Since you're making everything fresh I don't think you need to add much oil."}
{"text":"Just walked by this new place today and decided to try it out. The servers were all super nice and friendly. I had the kung-pao chicken with fried rice, and for a lunch special I got two dumplings and some fresh veggies, and a fountain drink. The dishes were all tasty, definitely one of the better asian food I've had in Pittsburgh. For $7.99, it was a LOT of food with varieties. I'm giving four stars as there is always room for improvement. Will come again."}
{"text":"This place is great! The dumplings are amazing- super juicy and flavorful.
Also, I like that everything I've gotten here (from the dumplings to standard Americanized Chinese food ) tastes homemade- it's not greasy and tastes super fresh. 
It's obvious that they're using better quality ingredients than other places.
Also, the service is great! The owner seems to be always there and he's super excited about what they're doing which is cute."}
{"text":"Two things here were exemplary: the service, and the giant portions. We were consistently checked in on, brought additional items without prompting, offered to have our personal water bottles refilled, etc. My entree was tasty, cooked to order with fresh ingredients, and lasted me three meals (one dinner and two lunches) - and I do not lack for an appetite. 

The only minor disappointment was that my friend ordered tofu expecting it to be the same dish I had, just with the meat swapped out, but instead ended up with just tofu and rice with her sides; a communication error that we didn't bother bringing up as we both still had plenty to chow on. 

If you eat here with a group, be aware seating is limited and mostly a bar along one wall."}
{"text":"Skeptical like everyone else here. and before I write this, just know I am NOT a picky eater, elitist or can even tell the difference between pepsi or coke. That being said about my taste buds the General Tso's was okay, not much sauce though. But I ended up eating that plain, as the rice was dry. I ended up throwing the rice away. Chicken Lo Mein was again, just okay - lacked sauce as well. My favorite part was the shrimp egg roll and the vegetable dumplings. The dumplings had a lot of flavor, but needed a dipping sauce. The wonton soup was unbearably salty. Do NOT get the wonton soup. I threw that out too. Some hits and misses. Glad I had a coupon for 50% off my bill, or else I'd be mad at the waste of money."}
{"text":"Walked past this new place a couple times before trying it. Had a good opportunity to try it out today for dinner and was not disappointed. It's fast casual Asian food - the classic bowls are enormous, easily enough for two meal (not complaining). You pick a starch, a main dish - I chose beef Szechuan which was delicious,  and a vegetable.

I tried the dumplings which were excellent and these little cheese balls which were tasty too.

You receive a fountain drink with the price of the meal, which is nice.

The service is very friendly, the food is fresh, authentic and bountiful. Great dinner and lunch spot, didn't get to try to breakfast but I've heard it's really good as well.

Certainly with a try when on the south side."}
{"text":"The service is super friendly, and the reason I'm giving this place 5 stars. The food is decent. Overall it is similar to but way healthier than a Panda Express. I had the king pao bowl, which was good, especially the brined boiled egg, but the serving of chicken was small, definitely a high carb to protein ratio. I had a lot of leftover but Lo mein with no chicken."}
{"text":"Super meh place. Don't think I'll return. I went in and immediately felt pressured into buying something from the staff. It was so awkward that I decided to try it just to break tension even though I wanted to leave -- What I was badgered into was weird combo options and a set up like a buffet, which wouldn't be too bad if there were more than four main options to choose from (two of which were general tso's and orange chicken... I feel like that doesn't necessarily count as separate but that's me). Beside that the chicken and vegetables that I was assured were \"fresh as of 10 minutes ago\" were soggy and greasy and the vegetable Lo Mein (same advertised freshness) was cold in some spots and scalding in others. The interestingly paired hard boiled eggs (I get it it's fusion) that came with it had some shells on them which I discovered upon biting into them. Then the cashier struggled to put the lid on the whole mound of awkward greasy fusion, the eggs sliding about like figure skaters for a whole minute adding more to my awkward encounter. She then showed me where the silverware was on the dining counters and grabbed a handful of it and put it in the bag. It was just... interesting. The \"lunch special\" that I had apparently ordered was just under ten dollars, which isn't all too special when I can go to Szechuan in Oakland and get great food of substantial portions for two bucks cheaper. Two stars cuz I'm not mean enough to give them one..."}
{"text":"Friendly service, had the shrimp lo mein and beef/onion dumplings. Lomein was good, a bit greasy for my taste, dumpling beef seemed to be undercooked for some reason, very pink inside - will prob give them another try though."}
{"text":"I was prompted by Groupon to try this establishment for lunch. Menu had a wide variety. I had Orange chicken with lomein. It was good and hearty enough for 2 meals. The portions are large. The staff was helpful. My only caution would be to read the fine print on the Groupon. A great South Side find."}
{"text":"It's not your normal Asian/Chinese food. It's quite healthy and not your standard greasy Chinese. Our food was delicious. The biggest thing that won me was the owner was about to close and he reopened the doors and turned the grill back on just to make us something. Taking the time just to make another happy customer is why we'll be going back."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience here.  The food tasted like if I tried to make Chinese food in my kitchen.  The place was dirty, especially the cooking area.  They were stressed out because they had 1 big grub hub order.   The fried rice was not fully cooked. Rice was still crunchy. Everything else was very greasy and not tasteful. Best thing I ate was the bok choy side.  Definitely don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I came from NYC to Pittsburgh for a long weekend.  We finished touring Mt. Washington and were in the south side looking for some Asian food for lunch.  The chef cooked in front of you.  We ordered two soup noodles and a vegetable.  Portion was huge.  We can only finished one noodle and half the vegetable.  Taste was fine, not excellent but not bad. Price is reasonable and considered cheap for the big portion. We also ordered some Chinese tea and they gave us two large cups of hot nice Chinese tea.  Service is very good too. They worked hard to maintain their business."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place bc I read some good reviews and I heard they offer a \"healthier choice\" of Chinese food. First off, the guy who took my order did not know how to navigate the register, and took 5 minutes just to take my order, and I was on my lunch break I had a time limit. Second off the food wasn't the greatest. It was way too salty and oily. Then a few days later I was at work and I was discussing places to eat around the Works and my manager described a bad experience here too. She said that they served her raw food and when she confronted them, the owner started yelling at her. Not worth the money in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Not sure I understand why the rave reviews. First thing I ordered was sezchuan chicken. It was terrible super salty and wilted veggies.

 Owner or manager came by and asked how it was. Told him and he offered to remake it fresh.  They remade a fresh batch. It was ok, but nothing to brag or rave about.  I was going to go with 1 star before he did that. 

I'll probably try something else next time."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place today for lunch. The food was alright. There were definitely too much noodles and not enough meat (Szechuan chicken, and note that it's SUPER spicy in a good way), but I like noodles so okay. The pork and green pepper dumplings were especially tasty. The best thing about the place is the service. Special shout out to the guy giving everyone the \"tour\" as we stood in line. Super friendly and nice. Only reason I'm giving it three stars? Cut to six hours later. My tummy is definitely not in a good place right now. Occam's razor tells me it's food poisoning. I've seen other great reviews for the place though so maybe I just caught them on a bad day?"}
{"text":"Good made to order food.

This place was a great lunch find. High quality fast Asian food at a great price. Food was freshly made and served to us by the owner himself who was an outstanding guy. For a quick just above fast food style meal you can't beat this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in for a late lunch yesterday. The owner was very friendly and helpful, explaining to us how the lunch special worked and explaining a little more about the food. Not your typical Chinese-American food, this was a healthier, lighter take on the usual dishes you see at any other place with lots of gluten-free and allergen-free options. I ordered the general tso's and he let me try it first to ensure it was to my tasting. It was a little different than what I am used to but I could definitely tell it was lighter and fresher (maybe a hint of pineapple?). I loved it! With the lunch special I got noodles, general tso's, veggies, an egg, two dumplings, and a fountain drink (for $1 more we added egg rolls). The owner told us to let him know if we wanted anything remade, or in the future made in front of us to let him know which was nice.The amount of food was large enough that I had leftovers for lunch the next day. My boyfriend loved his chicken and broccoli, but could not stop raving about his veggie dumplings and how pleasantly surprised he was. For the price and quantity you can't beat it, but the quality was an added bonus. If you're craving Chinese, but are trying to be a little healthier (or you have limited dietary restrictions) try Asian Fusion Bowl! You won't be sorry! I work close by so I will most definitely be back for lunch sometime."}
