{"text":"Inexpensive, authentically Mexican, delicious. For $8 you can have a huge burrito.If Lamb Soup or Lamb Shank is on the specials board, have that. Lovingly owner operated by Ben and Sofi."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food.  I had the pulled pork tacos.  My wife had the chicken quesadilla.  Both were very tasty. The quesadilla's crust was more like a spinach pie crust than a tortilla.  Yum.  We had the churros too.  Fried.  Yum.  We had a beer and a pop, two entrees and 2 deserts, for under 40 dollars."}
{"text":"Super loud music, vents hanging from the ceiling, waiter stood all up in my personal space and no one greeted us at the door. Menu could be displayed on a spreadsheet with types of meat on the X axis and types of tortilla preparation on the y axis. Tacos took 30 mins to arrive, did not taste fresh and made us feel so sick we couldn't even finish. I still can't even hear myself think, I've been permanently deafened by the music"}
{"text":"I've been to Sofi's four times - walked out once.

So sad that the service is so bad and the food is quite good.

Every time I've visited Sofi's the service is slow and lackluster at best, terrible at worst. Every time I've visited there are two servers but only one takes orders while the other seems to fill water.

Last time after waiting at the bar for a table and the server indicated that she would be right with us, we were ignored for at next 15 minutes, so we walked out and went to Mexico Lindo in Ajax. The service at Mexico Lindo was a 100 times better and the food was as good or better than Sofi's. Too bad cuz would love to support local restaurants.

If you want good Mexican food and bad service, check out Sofi's as you won't be disappointed.

If you want good Mexican food and great service, check out Mexico Lindo in Ajax (much better than Pickering location). Better atmosphere and much busier. Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, the atmosphere has a vintage vibe to it. Its really cheap so your getting a really good value for a cheap meal. Its really hidden in the plaza, but its definitely one of my go to places."}
{"text":"The food at this place was fantastic! .. but the service was terrible. Only one waitress was working I felt so bad for her but that meant we had to do a lot of waiting while she cleaned, and reset the tables after others left. My note to this restaurant... hire more staff."}
{"text":"This place has been around for months now and I was finally able to check it out, even though I live literally down the street.  Over the years that I have lived in the area, though, I've noticed that this location hasn't brought much luck to the tenants. Sofi's is probably the 3rd to take over the spot.  Fingers crossed that they'll be able to establish themselves nicely and as fortunate as say, Fratelli's, which is located at the same plaza and has been an icon at Old Kingston Rd., along with Ted's.

Their menu is quite extensive especially when it comes to tacos, which is nice.  They also do offer more of the Canadian type dishes such as poutine, wings, mac and cheese, which makes this a great place for a group that includes the foodies and the not-so-foodies.  Not only that, you can order from their pretty large specials menu so that your party can try many various dishes.  One thing I must add is that their presentation is beautiful! Makes you feel as though you're in a higher end type of restaurant 

Elotes: A nice start to a meal if you're gangsta enough to be sporting some pieces of corn stuck in yo teef.  The queso fresco was deliciously complimented with the paprika sprinkled on.  I just personally wished that the corn wasn't over-boiled.  I like to have that nice pop and crunch when I eat corn on a cob.  This was a little to mushy to me, but the flavor made up for it.  4.5/5

Ceviche: Very cute presentation in a martini glass, accompanied by some fried tortilla chips.  Though the presentation was cute, I'd personally rather have the chips on the side since it just gets soggy, unless of course, you eat it right away.  I've also had my share of fresh ceviche, mainly in Costa Rica, but their ingredients were still quite fresh.  I wish they did have more shrimp and scallops in it though, rather than the other garnishes. 4.5/5

Chicken Nachos: Had just a few bites but it thoroughly enjoyed it.  The chips were nicely cooked and didn't get soggy and kept their crunch.  Jalape√±os were very fresh, versus the usual pickled ones.  Serving was also quite generous so it's a perfect appetizer or for a pekish group. 5/5

Pescado (Fish Tacos): Because they have a pretty large tacos menu, I asked the waitress what they recommend and she recommended the Pescado which was a nice, meaty white fish.  It was nicely battered and not greasy at all.  I'm quite picky with my fish tacos but this I'd definitely order again. 5/5

Longosta (Lobster Tacos): Whenever there's lobster on the menu, it's a must try.  I'm glad that my friend feels the same way as we happily shared a platter.  We received a pretty good portion of lobster and it also tasted pretty fresh.  Definitely worth trying. 5/5."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh and authentic Mexican food. Excellent variety on the menu for even the pickiest eater, including kids. Very friendly service. Wonderful manager named Ella who welcomes everyone. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Try the fish tacos!!! Very authentic Mexican with a couple choices for the picky family member. Friendly and fast customer service and good prices with a really chill vibe. I wish more people would eat here cause I like a busy and lively atmosphere, but this restaurant doesn't seem to be appreciated in the neighborhood it's in, so I'm usually the only person in the place."}
{"text":"The server recommended upgrading our cheese nachos to veggie nachos and it was a great choice. Big portions though lettuce with nachos was a bit odd. Fajitas were a bit dry. But loved the sauce on their enchiladas."}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favourite places to eat EVER. I absolutely adore the chicken quesadilla and chicken nachos - they are some of the best I've ever had. The quesadillas always come out hot and crispy and packed full of ingredients, the orange sauce they drizzle on top is to die for and it's always LOADED with cheese (sometimes I actually ask for less cheese.). The chicken nachos are amazing, you get a large portion and are super tasty I love the purple cabbage as it's a great addition. I'm personally not a big fan of enchiladas but friends who I've brought to Sofi's said that they are tasty. I was not a fan of the burritos and although the tacos are tasty I find that all of the salsa and toppings make them a little cold and if you don't eat the tacos fast enough the tortillas can get soggy. Again if you go I'd 110% recommend the quesadillas and/or nachos as they are the best things on the menu - the enchiladas are great too. The desserts can be a little hit and miss - like the churros are decent but I've been spoilt by Panchos (in Kensington market) so nobody can really outdo them. I read other yelp reviews that complain about the service at Sofi's but I [luckily] haven't really experienced that if I'm honest. If you like spicy ask for some of \"Shaun's\" hot sauce on the side but beware it's definitely spicy. Lastly Monday - Thursday it's fine to \"walk in\" but Friday - Sunday make sure you have a reservation or are willing to wait as it can be SUPER packed."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this restaurant doesn't have more traffic. Staffs are nice and friendly. I had the Enchiladas de Pollo as per the waitress' recommendations and it was very delicious."}
{"text":"We had the surf and turf (a taco platter) and the brisket enchilada. Both were very good. Enchilada was rich, nicely flavored and very filling. The tacos were full of very different and interesting tastes. Portions were generous. Service was excellent - friendly and fast (thanks Ella). We are reserving the five stars to the tacos at Kensington Market, but their enchilada would certainly get our five stars.

{"text":"This was so gooood.  The Guac and chips were okay.  Nothing to write home about.

I got the lamb shank without Mash and omg, it was soo tender and was complimented by some delicious vegetables.

Yum, yum.

My friend that accompanied me was really skeptical, but now she wants to go back.  Yay lol."}
{"text":"I recommend this place to everyone that likes authentic Mexican food. I've been here a handful of times and everything I have had here is delicious. I especially love the lobster enchiladas, very good portion and there are huge chunks of lobster in the dish. I also like the elotes which is corn served in a delicious cheese sauce. The space is also very cute, good vibe, service is always good and I believe they have some live music on select nights. Love everything about this place."}
{"text":"So great to check out this Mexican place in the area. Never got to check out this location when it used to be a pub but loved what they did with the place now. The decor is nicely decorated and wait staff are attentive. My husband and I enjoyed the vegetarian nachos as an appetizer and had the salmon and tiger shrimp taco trio and lamb enchiladas as our entrees. Both our entrees were off the chalkboard as their specials and they did not disappoint. The lamb meat was very flavorful and texture was like beef brisket meat but more moist. The taco trio was made fresh and lots of nice vegetables and toppings. We also liked how they gave extra tortillas so you could almost eat the taco like a sandwich. The nachos were quite unique in that it had lots of vegetables in it and didn't seem as greasy as we thought. We liked all the fresh ingredients and felt truly satisfied after the meal. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, very accommodating staff. Current high chairs are not great but they have told my wife and I that new ones are being ordered.  Beef brisket and fish are our go-tos, have never been disappointed.  I would even go as far as to say these two tacos are on par with (or even better than) the trendy Mexican places downtown."}
{"text":"If your looking for the authentic Mexican food you gotta try this place.  It has a nice atmosphere with a great choice of food to try. So if your feeling the Mexican food vibe you gotta give this place a try"}
{"text":"I had the lamb enchalidas. It was delicious! The dish was so flavourful. I really recommend that everyone give this place a try! They have a live music late night on Fridays aswell.

I can't wait to come back and try one of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest Mexican fan, so it says something that Sofi's really impresses me. Super fresh ingredients, really nice service, great atmosphere. 

We had the nachos...they were full of flavours. Every bite had a different mix...really good!
Taco sampler...very good, but super messy. I liked the fish..i was a bit disappointed by the shrimps....not enough shrimpiness!
Also tried the pulled pork enchiladas...excellente! Great flavours...rice was so tasty...

Go here for a date, or a special dinner. It's a bit pricy, but not ridiculous by any means. Great to have a quality restaurant in the East.

I'll be back Sofi!"}
{"text":"Finally, some good Mexican food in my area! I have always thought I needed to go downtown to get authentic Mexican food, and I am so happy that I can just drive 9 minutes away to Sofi's! The food is incredible - the chicken and fish tacos I had were extremely flavourful, and the service was beyond excellent. The guacamole is pretty chunky... I'm mentioning this because some people like it smooth, some like it with lots of texture! All in all, Sofi's is definitely a hidden gem and I'm so glad I found it (thanks to yelp)!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere/Decor: 5/5 score
I was very impressed by the warm and cozy ambience.    Reminded me of mexico. There were cowboy hats on the wall, and western themed decor. Upbeat Latin music and the centered location of the bar area made it feel very welcoming. The backdrop lighting along the bar and other areas of the restaurant are bright and add a colorful accent to the space.  

Service: 4/5
Ordered for take out and service was real fast. Our waitress/host greeted us with a welcoming smile.

Brisket Enchiladas - 3/5
The rice was flavourful and the chimichurri sauce added a nice touch. I regretted choosing the brisket because it wasn't very appetizing. Despite the queso fresco, the dish didn't do it for me. 

I'd definitely sit down to have some drinks here and try some of the other items on the menu. This 4 star rating is mainly based on atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Chris and I had lunch today at Sofi's Mexican Bar & Grill. Lovely choice on the menu. We enjoyed the Taco Trios:
Appetizer: 
Elotes - Boiled Sweet Corn, Queso Fresco Sauces, Sweet Paprika
Main:
Tostada Vegetarianianos - SGrilled Organic Vegetables, Guacamole, Bean Puree, Lettuce & Pico De Gallo;
Tinga - Chipotle Roasted Chicken, Iceberg Lettuce, Pico De Gallo & Sour Cream
Pescado - Deep Fried White Fish, Lettuce, Guacamole, Pico De Gallo, Chipotle Aiol

The hot sauce was infused with flavour and heat! Love it!
Our waitress was awesome! We love her recommendations and service. Thanks Krista.  The combination of good food and Krista's recommendation, charm and conversation made for a delightful experience."}
{"text":"I've been looking for tacos in Scarborough for months and by luck I came across this beautiful place! The interior is soo nice and well designed. The food was amazing! I got the surf and turf special which included steak taco, brisket taco, shrimp taco and lobster taco. I LOVED the shrimp and steak!! My friend ordered the shrimp trio and she loved it too! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is more bar than restaurant, which is why it's surprising that the Mexican food is pretty good!

Tried various tacos and some burrito.  The fish taco was the best.  Only complaint is that the food/plates could have been warmer.

Server/bartender was nice."}
{"text":"A quaint quiet Mexican restaurant tucked away in a small little village like area is Scarborough.  The flautas were delicious.  One of my favourite Mexican dishes.  The Brisket nachos were a hit.  Lots of meat, a full meal.  Order the Pico de gallo on the side, it is a little watery.  The steak taco was also very good.  Overall everything was tasty and homemade.  A nice find and worth coming back."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend ate here for the first time tonight and it was fantastic. We started with the guacamole and chips which tasted very fresh. For the main course I got enchiladas and she got the quesadilla and both of us enjoyed our meal very much. The service was good considering there was only one server working. I never had an empty glass of water and didn't have to wait long for our meals. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!! Went there on a Friday evening with my daughter and mother and there was only one waitress working all the tables. I ordered the brisket,shrimp, and pork tacos. Shrimp taco was ok but the shrimp are TINY. The brisket was horrible and the pork was ok. After eating here my mother and I became ill. My daughter did not but she didn't eat the pork so I'm figuring it was the pork. My whole weekend was a ruined as I was so sick. Do not eat here!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been going here for a long time absolutely love the food however changing anything on the menu seems to be a problem. Requestion no tomatoes and asking for guacamole or queso seem to be a big problem. Waitress suggested it would be to much for the kitchen staff. I didn't ask for any thing additional that was not on the menu. 

The staff is very friendly and nice. I went in a large group and not everyone agreed. I will say every times i have gone they seem to be seriously under staffed.

I keep going because food is honestly out of this world good."}
{"text":"Sofi's has quickly become my all-time favourite Mexican restaurant and I have never been a huge fan of Mexican food. Who remembers Chi-Chi's? Okay, this is nothing like that. I love this food!

I've been here many times since my original review and have enjoyed many dishes - just take a look at my pics. This review update, however, was prompted by one of tonight's dinner specials, the Lamb Shank. OMG! Delicious!

I'll keep coming back as long as they keep serving food like this."}
{"text":"Quiet and cute restaurant.  The waitress was great, only one person serving the various tables.   The food was ok.  What was the disappointment was that the lobster enchiladas were made with chopped up shrimp, passed off as lobster.  Maybe I'll just try regular tacos, next time."}
{"text":"So i come here expecting it to be ghetto since it is in deep scarborough but it's not.  It's more upscale/loungy decore however it's missing the mexican authenticy.  It's just a few mirachi band hats hanging on the walls with a few old pictures and jazzy/frank sinatra music playing, no mexican classics.  You'd think it would be at least a little bit of Day of the Dead themed with some sugar skulls as decor but i guess it's supposed to be family friendly.  So I sit at the bar, no napkins or utensils, had to ask.  The drink menu is small with beer and wine, not really any specialty drinks like bulldogs/beer-garitas.  The Piscado (fish tacos) was alright.  It was served with a lemon not a lime.  My napkin gets take away.  Asked for another napkin with a fork and spoon.  Beef brisket burritos was alright, almost dry but didnt taste like beef brisket.  Out of all, it was alright, it dosnt have enough authenticy for me.  I'd prefer Playa Cabana on Dupont and Davenport.  This is the first place I've seen that doesn't have El Jimador."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant. The ambiance is amazing, friendly staff and unforgettable food. My staples are the guacamole, sirloin quesadilla, brisket mac and cheese.. and the Pinot noir! My family and I have celebrated a few birthdays here and got a dessert platter that was delish. We also visited on Valentines with a prefix menu and ate like kings... I can't say enough!"}
{"text":"Imagine a Mexican restaurant that runs out of guacamole ! Doesn't seem like a big deal ?!? It's on pretty much every option in the menu so no guacamole is kind of a big deal. Then to be told by the server so flippantly \"O by the way we don't have any guacamole\" It was made all the more disappointing  because one of the reasons we went was because we were told their organic guacamole was amazing ! Not last night it wasn't... Service we were a group of 10 and waited 30 minutes before our first drink came. Way too slow but we weren't surprised as Sofis has a reputation for very poor slow service. We were expecting it so we're not surprised. On a positive the food is fresh and flavourful. Would we go back ? Yes we would for the food but the poor service and unforgivable lack of guacamole let them down."}
{"text":"Was in the area for work and checked Yelp for a late lunch spot. It opens at 4pm, so we were good and hungry. We all had 3 tacos, a variety of fish, pulled pork and beef. Very good ! Well presented and friendly server. The restaurant is a mix of classy and fun, the kitchen looked spotless when I glanced in.  The neighbourhood is improving and I hope Sofi does well."}
{"text":"Food & drinks are good.  Only bad thing is not enough waiters and sometimes slow service."}
{"text":"Have dinner for a pre-birthday!  Found this great Mexican place in our neighborhood! Food, service, atmosphere and prices are fantastic! If you are in the Westhill area drop in try the food, you will fall in love with the place."}
