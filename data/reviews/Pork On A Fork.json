{"text":"I was expecting a little more based on the good reviews. I ordered the brisket and wife had the monster. The barbecue sauce was fine but the meat was a little dry. Sides were fine. The service was minimal, no smiles and the cashier wasn't really helpful."}
{"text":"BBQ how you like it!!  Smoked, charred, grilled to make your taste buds pop.  Many options to choose from and mouthwatering.     Yummy Yummy to my Tummy!!! Happy Man!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service was even better! Mac & cheese was amazing. Got the pulled pork bowl and loved it. My boyfriend got a burrito and enjoyed his just as much. So happy to have a tasty BBQ restaurant in our area!"}
{"text":"Ordered a half slab of ribs for carry out. Got home and there were 5 ribs, and this cost $15? The ribs were also dry. Don't think I will be going back again."}
{"text":"So glad they opened here! This is really decent BBQ... The prices are decent and the portions are generous. Definitely worth it on cheat day!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ place I've ever been too. They have so many types of sauce and their meats are always fresh"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Sunday, had a lot of traffic which is always a good sign. I ordered the BBQ sampler with brisket, pulled pork and pulled chicken.  I loved the brisket and pork, full of flavor and super tender. The chicken was ok. Perfect amount of smoke.  The beef brisket was my favorite. I also loved the sweet potato fries and the beans were awesome, not too sweet. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"$15 dollars later ..... I was super stuffed and felt like a greasy mess (I had the Midwest Monster). The food was not bad! It was just not incredibly amazing for the price! My friend went with her bf and spent $30 on two people!"}
{"text":"First time here, stopped because of the reviews, and because I saw DDD was here. Some of the best BBQ ribs I have ever had!  The ribs were perfectly smoky, with a little brown sugar and a spicy kick.  I really appreciated that the ribs were cooked well, had a nice crust, and were beautifully juicy inside. One of the nice young ladies who works there brought us some excellent cornbread muffins to accompany our ribs, very nice of her! I would definitely recommend, and I plan to be back- worth the 2 hour drive from tucson!"}
{"text":"Dined in for dinner a couple of weeks ago. Tried a sample of Ribs and Brisket.  I LOVED the brisket-it was very tender, and had great flavor. Ribs were fall off the bone tender. They offer several different sauces- sweet and smokey to hot and spicy. I really like the hot and spicy.  We will be back for more great BBQ!"}
{"text":"The people were super friendly and the ribs were fantastic. A true gem of a place and one I have already recommended to others. I will be back. The mac & cheese is spicy and tasty - not your typical mac & cheese. I look forward to trying the brisket next."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome people working there! Anytime I'm in the area I make it a point to stop in. I consider it to be one of the top BBQ spots in Phoenix. Definitely get some brisket and the Mac and cheese is killer!"}
{"text":"Honestly wasnt that impressed... I work at a Hotel near this Resturant and i had a few guest tell me about it and how much they liked it. But when i finally go and try this place it really wasnt that good and kinda pricey.. Really got my hopes up on this one."}
{"text":"These folks at Pork on a Fork are simply delightful and the food was AWESOME!  We had a graduation party for 25 and all everyone could talk about was the fantastic food we had.  We opted for ribs and chicken, mac and cheese, salad and baked beans...and wow, it was very yummy!  Veronica was a dream to work with...delivery was on time and just as promised...and my invoice was accurate.  I couldn't have asked for more.  When we return to the Phoenix area, we will be calling Pork on a Fork again for sure!!  5 Stars!!  :)"}
{"text":"\"Best BBQ in the Valley!\"  Oh stop!  Save your money.  Go to Rudy's in Chandler for the wet brisket or back to KC.   This place is below average.  Ribs are poor.  Slaw is tasteless.  Fries are greasy.  The beans are at least decent.  Beef is way overcooked and not flavorful.  Poor ambiance.  A garage without any character.  Sloppy order handling.  Overpriced, way overpriced.  Skip it!  Take a bagged lunch with peanut butter.  Just cutesy marketing with lousy food.  Poor effort, Pork, start over.  No wet wipes?  Worthless napkins?  Staff too busy or poorly trained to take care of customers?  What were you thinking?  We are BBQ starved in Phoenix, but THIS? Very disappointed and not going near there again."}
{"text":"Pulled pork is just right, almost melts in your mouth and its not greasy like most. The best bbq place I've been to in the valley."}
{"text":"1st time trying this place. Have to say last one as well. My wife and 2 boys went in high hopes and we'll fell short way short. Everybody had pulled pork and I had the monster. Everything was extremely dry. You had to drown the meat in there sauce. The meat didn't look pulled at all looked like small cubes. As for the taste the meat had NO pork flavor at all. All you taste is smoke flavor. I've had good BBQ and this was not award winning pork. If you like your pork with just smoke flavoring added to this is your place. As for the sides, blah!! Potato salad bland macaroni salad bland dry coleslaw the only thing halfway decent was a frys and even them you can tell were store bought and just thrown in a fryer. They tried to add flavor by sprinkling paprika on all there sides. Their barbecue beans taste like they were canned and added some pulled pork or brisket to it to make it their own. Looks like older reviews when first opened and when DDD TV show was there it might have been better but by far from being any good. I'll stick to Tom's BBQ a lot cheaper and WAY better. A true BBQ place you smell the BBQ not this place."}
{"text":"Its ok, but honestly i was extremely embarrassed when the cashier charged me for three platters instead of the two i ordered and i had to start returning food in front of a packing waiting area because id only brought 40$ in my wallet. And the wait times just to get the food always average around 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Love the pulled pork sandwich here!  Mac and cheese and bbq baked beans round out my meal perfectly."}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it! I'm here every Friday, that's why I'm currently the DUKE!  The staff is awesome at P on a F, they are all really friendly.  The only complaint I have is my shirt stinks like delicious smoked BBQ the rest of the day. I order the brisket sandwich with sweet potato fries. I'll be in every Friday defending my Dukedom and stuffing my face!"}
{"text":"Great food as always for a good price! Cashier seemed grumpy today and can ruin one's appetite!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing BBQ and service. What a friendly and helpful staff!  The menu is diverse and the servers are super helpful if you are undecided. 4 different homemade sauces to smother your hearts delight and the pulled pork is heavenly melting in your mouth. Highly recommend this BBQ. Best I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Food is incredible and everyone there is super friendly! Since moving here a few months ago I was introduced by a neighbor and have since brought everyone I can to POAF. Do yourself a favor and try the Midwest monster with Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Found this place because of a Yelp search for BBQ. The food was good. The service was good and it's close by. Would definitely go there again. Our company brought this in for lunch today (6/18/14) and now everyone loves it!  Did not disappoint"}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal here! This time I went for the Sampler and substituted Brisket for the Chicken, +$1.49(not a huge fan of chicken on the bone) Pork, and a smoked sausage.  Delicious! The Pork was better than last time, more juicy. The Smoked Sausage was one of the best pieces of sausage I have ever had. Great Smokey flavor and an awesome snap! The Brisket, well 1 piece was better than the other, but still great. I think the 1 piece was a bit of a burnt end, which I know some people love, but it was just a tad tougher and drier than the other. I am hooked on this place and have upgraded to 5 Stars. I think next on the list is to try their Ribs!  The only thing I can say about some of the previous bad reviews is they got a bad meal, it happens..."}
{"text":"Great bbq. Everything done right, down to the perfect dispensing bottles. Great choices, love that you can get waffle fries, cooked to order. The meat is juicy, tender, not over seasoned."}
{"text":"Place has excellent food,probably the best mac and cheese ever. Only problem is the dining room was dirty and the damn flies , every time I eat there I get invaded by flies. I will only do take out from know on."}
{"text":"Loved the pulled pork. Great mac/cheese and baked beans were bananas delicious! Friendly folks and legit bbq in Phoenix finally!"}
{"text":"Today we didn't feel like firing up the grill, so the most brilliant idea popped into my head and I said, \"Ooooh!! I want ribs! Let's order from Pork on a Fork!\"  We each ordered the sampler plate, subbed briskit for the chicken, and even added a couple ribs.  We ordered our meals to go and couldn't wait to get home to get our grub on. Oh my goodness!! I was loving every bite of the tender briskit, the ribs, the pulled pork, mac n cheese, and coleslaw!  Whew!! It was a very delicious and satisfying meal, and while I wasn't able to finish it, no worries! I plan on finishing it later... well, that is if I ever get hungry again  By far the best BBQ I've ever had in Phoenix!...  well hell, I'd even say it was better than any I've had in TX! If you love BBQ, you will not be disappointed! And if you're a vegetarian... their coleslaw is super phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and BBQ beans. The meat was decent but dry. I added the smokey BBQ sauce twice to try and moisten it up.  There didn't seem to be any sauce on the meat to start with.  Same issue with the coleslaw; there was little more than chopped cabbage.  The meal was saved by the beans which were quite tasty."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've tasted in Phoenix! I had the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and baked beans and for lunch. The pork was tender, moist, and had a perfectly underwhelming smoky flavor. The beans were equally as amazing as the pork with chunks of BBQ meat mixed it, awesome. Coleslaw is coleslaw, but most importantly it was fresh and crispy.   I'll agree that sauces are not spicy, but there is a good range with different flavors for different tastes. I don't understand the review that gave 1 star and described the pork as \"dry\" and the consistency of \"baby food\" at the same time, seems contradictory to me. I think the owners take their food very seriously so I would be surprised to find anything sub-par on their menu.  Bottom line, it's going to be hard to take any of the other BBQ joints in the area seriously. Pork on a Fork is on another level completely, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Wonderful discovery. Pulled pork plate was top notch. Good amount of food. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing brisket and smoked sausage , great mac salad. And good services and prices. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"We tried the pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches.  The beef was as a tender as butter - no need to even use a knife.  The pulled pork was a great variety of smokines and slighly crispy ends--yum!  They have four selections of sauces and we mixed and matched to our content.  Very nice owners and definitely the best BBQ we've had in quite a while.  We wish they were open on weekends!"}
{"text":"2 words: Food Poisoning I ate a handful of times to Pork on a Fork after they opened. I thought it was great to have a close place with good BBQ...... Until my colleague and I went for lunch recently. I had the worst night in my recent memory. My colleague also got sick. Now I can't think about Pork on a Fork without feeling sick."}
{"text":"The brisket was moist and tender. Had good smokey flavor!! I will definitely come back again next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Pulled pork, Midwest monster is fantastic as well. The people behind the counter are super helpful and friendly. 5 star !"}
{"text":"I had the sampler platter with pulled pork, brisket, and a chicken thigh with sides of mac n cheese and beans.  The beans were a bit cold, but the mac n cheese was very good.  It actually had real cheese rather than just a cheese sauce.  The pulled pork was excellent and I would definitely come back for it.  The brisket had very good flavor, but I did have a few bites that were a little dry.  The chicken thigh was very good and had the buttery texture that I love when eating smoked chicken.  I prefer not to use BBQ sauce but I did try 3 of the 4 that they carry.  I enjoy spicy food but the spicy bbq sauce tasted like an ashtray finished with vinegar.  Needless to say that I didnt care for any of their sauces.  However, I came for the BBQ meat, not the sauce, and was not disappointed!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The pulled pork was good but their buns were dry, like they had been left out too long.  They do have a variety of 5 sauces to choose from."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ.  Ribs and Pulled pork are so good they don't even need sauce... However the BBQ Sauces are awesome!!!Sweet & Mild, Crazy J Hot & Zippy Mustard are all amazing.   Fred Langley catered his party with this place and it was the best I have ever had!   Gonna go there bet soon!!!"}
{"text":"Was craving for something filling after what seemed like a purgatorial wait at the dealership for my vehicle today.  Scanning the archetypal lunch recommendation from Yelp's search list I spot POAF.  This is not my first visit here so I know what to expect and my recollection was of: messy fingers, sauce residue in and around the mouth and lots of used napkins; this despite using the plastic utensils.   They've expanded since my last visit to now include the front of the building that used to be a coffee place which now serve as their take-out area.  The dining area is relatively the same from what I can remember - a few seating up-front and a larger area in the back.   Today, I went with the sampler again but I opted for all the proteins -- pulled pork, beef brisket, sausage and chicken with mac & cheese and baked beans for sides.  It was as good as I can recall from my last experience but I can only give it 4 stars because Corky's in Memphis, TN, in my opinion, was my Gold standard in BBQ.  Overall, great friendly service as usual and food that's definitely re-eatable (as in worth coming back for).  P.S.  If you're planning to go elsewhere after having dined here, then you might want to bring cologne or perfume because the smoky BBQ bouquet will cling to your clothes. I suppose it's not as bad as the smoke of a different nature from the casinos."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times now (2 dine in and 1 UberEATS). Each time they were out of something that we wanted. The first 2 times they were out of cornbread. The bbq is ok in flavor but dry. This is ok because they have sauce but you would expect a bbq joint to have very juicy meat. The worst experience was when we used UberEATS. We asked for extra sauce one of each kind because they have 4. We didn't receive any sauce at all. We called Uber who called the restaurant which said they only give 1 cup of sauce even though we didnt get any. For this reason I recommend avoiding using delivery or going elsewhere if you want juicy bbq."}
{"text":"Your barbecue is very good. The brisket is good the ribs are good. One of the best places on the side of town.  Definitely worth worth a try"}
{"text":"I really like BBQ and since this is local to my business I go there quite frequently and have to say not only does it taste great but the prices are very reasonable as are the portion sizes."}
{"text":"I  dine here on a regular basis when I get the hankerin' for some bbq because it is within biking distance from my house. I have been coming here for a few years and have noticed the quality drop significantly. A few years ago I would order the pulled pork sandwich and it would be so good and moist and have the perfect fat to meat ratio it wouldn't need any sauce at all. Now it is so dry you have to drench it in sauce just to be able to swallow it. I really hate to mask the flavor of bbq with sauce. POAF if you are reading this please go back to making your bbq like you did a few years back. What happened to you guys? Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Slightly leery of food places with Guy Fieri plastered everywhere, but I did see they made a National top 10 BBQ list so I had to try.  I don't remember much after eating the brisket....that's really all that mattered in life.  It melts in your mouth, and all is right at that moment.   The service is good, and the ambiance actually matches a BBQ joint pretty well.  I'm knocking off a star because it is hard to find, but the food is what matters most, and it was awesome."}
{"text":"This kind of breaks my heart giving this place a drop in the love category. We've been coming here for years and it's going downhill. I want to say it's because we came in 45 minutes to close, but I'm not fully sure it is. They have certainly cut a lot from their menu.  Last night my husband and I went in and got our meal to go...we new we were going in late and didn't want to keep the workers.  Husband ordered the sausage and got 1 link...usually with an evening meal it comes with 2, but this came with one. I didn't realize until after we left and he said something. I ordered the brisket because they no longer sell chicken (except pulled chicken). It was very dry, not normal for POAF. I feel like they changed the potato salad recipe as well because I didn't like it at all and I've always loved the potato salad. They got rid of the mac n cheese bites too because they didn't sell enough, but every time we went in they were out so I'm not sure how true that is. So I got the Mac n cheese regular and it's very bland and tasted like cooked noodles, no cheese flavor at all. Hubby liked his baked beans though so that's good because his 1 sausage link wasn't filling. Not saying I won't return, but I certainly am not craving a second night of it like I always do.  When we left last night I told my husband I bet they are going out of business and that's why they've downgraded so much on selections."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the portions were great!  I got the pulled pork sandwich with a side of macaroni salad and sweet potato fries. The buns were soft and fluffy, and there was a generous amount of pork. My brother said the beef brisket was really good. My dad got the burrito and it was huge.  All the sauces for your meats are at each table. Our table had the zippy mustard, smoky & tangy BBQ, and mild & sweet BBQ,  My brother's and my favorite was the zippy mustard; I also liked the sweet & mild BBQ.  Note: they put the fries in the fryer after you order them so if you're super hungry and/or in a rush, you should avoid the fries. My dad had to wait a few mins for his waffle fries, and I waited quite a bit for my sweet potato fries (and a few still weren't fully cooked).  Verdict: will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and catering services! We served Pork on a Fork brisket and shredded pork with several sides for a family gathering of 18. The food was delicious with very generous portions. Ordering and pick up was easy. Great value."}
{"text":"Best BBQ ever! We love the food, the staff, and did I mention the food. We have had to cut back from having it every weekend because it was helping is gain some unwanted weight LOL but everyone we introduce to Pork on a Fork loves it and becomes a loyal follower as well."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in a while. Its the kind of place that you find as a one-off and realize what you are missing out on in the world of American BBQ"}
{"text":"Pork on a Fork - Exceptional!! Those of us who love BBQ just know when it is done right.  Pork on a Fork does it right!  All of the food is tasty, but the Baby Back Ribs might be the best that I have had outside of Texas.   We picked up food for a party and the catering department had everything ready on time and well packaged for freshness.  It is worth it to add the Baby Back Ribs to the main selection for a small additional fee. They included a full-sized BBQ sauce in three flavors, which our guests loved.  We have also dined at their location, which is a throw-back to any of the BBQ joints that I have always found to have the best food (meaning, don't expect fancy).  I usually try to include a downside for your consideration, but had to think hard for this one, so here goes -  the restaurant is a little hard to find since it is in an office park.  On second thought, the location is not a problem once you get in and have a Baby Back Rib."}
{"text":"Congats guys. I am so happy for you. A 5 star product at a 3 star price. The best BBQ in Phoenix bar none! Love me some Pork on a Fork!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but the staff are very absent minded and/or bad at service. Ordered the food corn bread wasn't ready but would be another 8 min. No big deal the staff was super nice and offered a side of coleslaw just because. My wife ordered a side salad and they said they would make it and bring it right out. 5 min later no salad I go up and ask for the salad was told \"someone is making it\". 5 min later still \"making it\" Well 15 min later he cornbread comes out and still no salad I ask the cook where the side salad and then the cook was surprised cause no one asked him to make a side salad. Two min later salad came. A lot of wilted lettuce and huge pieces of lettuce that my wife had to tear herself. Food was alright but I won't be going out of my way to go to this place again."}
{"text":"This is terrific no frills barbeque. The meat is full of flavor and juicy... sauces are served on the side and are also really good. Try the Midwest Monster - you won't be disappointed and your taste buds will be kept very busy!"}
{"text":"Went there recently with my wife for a late lunch. We had the sampler as well as the ribs. The brisket was dry as was the chicken. Rib meat should fall off the  bone not hang on for dear life. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"My fiance found POAF online when we were looking for a good BBQ place to cater for our wedding. We decided to come in for lunch and try a sample plate of everything. HOLY COW (no pun intended) the meats were amazing and the beans were to die for! The dining area we heard is new so once you have your plate and can't wait to eat it at home, you can enjoy in the back dining room where they jave soda machines, booths, tables, etc. with all of their amazing sauces on the tables to enjoy. Needless to say we got Matt's info to set up a meeting to cater - can't wait for May 23rd to come! ;-)"}
{"text":"I had a small craving for BBQ and unfortunately after I was full the craving only became BIGGER. Now I fear I might be venturing out into the late night only seeking more of its deliciousness!!  I ordered a brisket sandwich with a side of BBQ beans and a side salad. It did cost more than I would like to spend and I wasn't able to finish it all. Kinda wish there was an option to just buy the sandwich and a bag of chips."}
{"text":"I love to BBQ myself , and lived in Texas, as well as Kansas City MO, and I can tell you this place is AWESOME!!! Great balance of taste on the meats, nice smoke, great sides, and the BBQ sauce is awesome. New favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"Really good meat!  I had the ribs without the sauce.  I can tell you the rub was very flavorful.    We also had the pulled pork bowl.   The rice and beans were less than desirable,  but again,  the meat was really good.    They could improve on the side  salad... there was nothing to it really.    Only greens and a few yellow peppers.  They have other stuff to top it with,  but minimal (tomatoes,  pickles,  cheese,  corn ).   Definitely worth your time.  Your belly won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This was mine and a friends FIRST and LAST time.  We both ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich. After adding some BBQ sauce as most people would, we began to eat with great expectations.  After the first bite, the meat had a STRONG smoke taste, but unfortunately lacked the pork flavor. The meat was dry, so we requested some au jus and added that to the sandwich. This made the poor quality bun fall apart. (Yuk)  Most of the pork looked and felt like it was run through a food processor. It was so mushy, that most of it had the texture of baby food. (Yuk again)  For side orders, we both had the waffle fries that looked good but, no flavor. They were fried in oil that was too cool and therefore, ugh. And we also had the BBQ beans that was no more than pork and beans from a can. (Yuk again)  Even the sodas were watered down!  Not a good experience from a new establishment.  Hmmm ... maybe they just had a bad day.  I know we did too! We should have compained but, our payback is this review and ... our pass-it-along message to family and friends.  Roger  P.S.: The parking accommodations sucked too!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I had pulled pork, sausage and brisket. It was great! The line was a little long but I feel like that's always a good sign!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Pork On A Fork for over 4 years and have always enjoyed the food. The place is in a warehouse area and not fancy but the food is good although a bit pricey.    We made reservations, a week ahead of time, for the Prime Rib/Salmon menu for Friday, February 14 (Valentines Day) thinking this would be an excellent meal and in a casual environment.   When we arrived 10 minutes before our reservation the hostess said they could not seat us.  Not at all!!!!  No other explanation other than they had overbooked reservations.  She did say we could order \"to go\" if we wanted.   In all my years of dining out I have never experienced this kind of treatment.  I can promise you that we will never return to this place and will discourage everyone we know from going.  You lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Tried Pork on a Fork 1st time today. Recommended by a friend, work nearby. I ordered the brisket sandwich, the wife got ribs, sides were beans, cole slaw, potato salad & mac salad. Brisket was very good, so were the ribs, crazy js hot bbq sauce good, though not real hot. Slaw was good, potato salad bland, no seasoning, beans were nothing special. Disappointing thing, the portions. I know, your thinking - they were looking to pig out! But seriously for $30  total the brisket sandwich very small, 6 bones on the ribs, sides really small. The styrofoam container for the beans wasn't 1/2 full. We had take out, so maybe dine in is better. Was left hungry!"}
{"text":"Not bad, a little on the high priced side, but food overall was good. Hopefully they can get a following, place for the most party was empty at lunch time.  I've noticed any restaurant that goes in that location has a tough time making it.  Had higher hopes for macaroni & cheese, it wasn't overly flavorful, but pork was good, moist & no fat in what I received which was a plus."}
{"text":"Pretty weak sampler plate. About 2 pieces of brisket, few shreds of chicken, half a sausage, and a baby amount of pulled pork. That would've all been okay had it actually been good. It was mediocre as can be. The sauce is solid, but the food leaves a lot to be desired. I do not believe that this food is slow cooked for 14 hours. Has no smoke flavor in it. And it generally tastes like the kind of \"bbq\" you'd get at a bar.  Try MJ's BBQ in downtown Phoenix for some real stuff. Won't be here again even though it's near my work. Don't let your suburban taste buds fool you. Say no thanks."}
{"text":"I was a little confused about the Friday menu, but got passed that.  My wife ordered the burrito with a mix of pulled pork and beef brisket.  They were out of black beans so they subbed with bake beans.  She thought it was ok, not entirely memorable.  She also got mixed up with the sides and their availability (Friday menu thing again).  I ordered the sampler with the two rib add-on, to hit all the high points.  My meats were a little fatty, but the ribs were good.  Overall, while I'd eat here again, I don't think I'd go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  Definitely worth stopping by.  Better than all other bbqs in the area.  I've been to them all, trust me."}
{"text":"Hands down..the BEST BBQ baby back ribs around. I have had BBQ at Bobby Q's, Bryans Backyard BBQ, Dillons,Big Apple,Toms,Lovejoys,Famous Dave's, Sir Charles, Honeybears and many other places. This place beats them all for bbq ribs. The ribs are tender, not fatty, and full of flavor with the perfect char. I am the type that always leaves something on the bone because the meat is usually fatty or cartlidge. Not these, I cleaned them bare.The BBQ sauces are delicious, but I found you don't need to slather the ribs with them. The meat can stand on its own! I have also had the brisket and pulled pork and those were also delicious. But the ribs- WOW! The sides did not blow me away,They were not bad just did not taste as homemade as I like. I have tried the beans, coleslaw,potato salad,cornbread(thank you for serving REAL butter, not the hydrogenated oil goop) and sweet potato fries. I wish I could have tried the mac n cheese but they were out. Greens would also be a welcome addition so we don't carb overload.A little work on the sides is all they need. And a larger dining area!The service is so friendly and these are down home good Nebraska boys who have their own hog farm in Nebraska. The gal that works there is also very nice. Checking on you to make sure everything is ok. They all know how to get their \"Pig\" on! Please expand to a larger dining area and extended hours! I love the fact that such a great place is only a 10 min drive from me! Prices are decent as well. I can't believe I did not write a review for them before this!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm an addict.  I wasn't big on BBQ before but love this place and go back.  I do have to repeat myself often of what my order is and I think it's more of the persons attention than rest. noise.  I like the selection of sauces they give you and honestly, I always bring a bag of chips (I put my pulled pork on them to eat it).  I asked at the front one day to make sure it's ok and they said they welcome it and have never once said anything to me about it.  That alone boosts them a star!  They have the Belly ap for frequent guest rewards.  The staff are friendly and welcoming.  The seating area is very clean.  Urgh...now I am craving BBQ for lunch..."}
{"text":"Still really like this place but was a bit bummed with part of my lunch order today. I decided to give their sweet potato fries a try & took my order to go. When I got home & opened up the box I found only about 6 sweet potato fries with my meal (see photo). Maybe they were running low & this is not the usual amount they serve, but I feel like I was jiped!"}
{"text":"This is a small café t that is strictly for meat lovers. And meat lovers will love Pork on a Fork's meat,  .The valley has a lot of barbecue joints. Many of them are good. Pork on a Fork simply kicks it up a notch. . Those who loved pulled pork will find their day's activities just happen to take them close to Pork on a Fork from anywhere in the Valley, whether they drive there or fly in. Great food, which will keep you going back for more. Just wish they were opened longer."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ in Phoenix, good size portions, great side items. A must have !!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Facebook a while ago. Yesterday they posted they were going to have prime rib tonight. So I called them to reserve two plates a day before and set a time I would be there.  I walk into the place and go to the start of the line. Stand there for about 5 minutes before I'm even aknowleged. Finally, after the two girls right in front of me ignore me, someone from the back asks what I would like. I tell them I reserved two prime ribs and they instruct me to go to the cash register. I then checked out and waited in the dining area for my food.  Time goes by, with a server who keeps telling us just a couple minutes guys. At the 60 minute mark from when we sat down a food runner comes and asks us for a recepit because they don't even see or orders back there. 5 minutes later they come out with our order; wrong sides. 65 minutes finally went by before we had our order in front of us!!  The prime rib wasn't done, so it looked like they put it on the grill to speed it up. Overdone outside and a completely rare inside.    First time and I will never go back. Service alone was enough, not to mention food that wasn't cooked correctly."}
{"text":"Went with my mom because we were in the area and saw a sign for them. We got the big boy sampler and a sandwich. Her side portions were much larger than mine. They measure out the meat so that every portion is the same but the sides just go right onto the tray so its not very consistent..  The bbq beans and the coleslaw were great. The potato salad was average but the mac salad just tasted like vinegar.   The meats were about what you'd expect. Was okay. Nothing great, nothing terrible. The sauces were good but I would have preferred a side like fries so I could try out each sauce on something else before putting it on my meat.   The sandwich meal is a good deal but I wouldn't get the big boy again. Not worth the price I paid for it."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. A unique warehouse setting with blues music in the background works well with the amazing BBQ and tasty sides. Friendly and fast service too. We recently moved from Tennessee and have been searching for good BBQ in the Phoenix area, and we gave this place a chance after reading good Yelp reviews. The Midwest Monster was divine and I highly recommend it if you like spicy food."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a great bbq place in the Phoenix area for years.  After my lunch today I have to keep looking.  I was born in Phoenix but have lived in Texas.  While in Texas I was told a couple of tips on finding a great bbq place.  First, if you can't smell bbq when you are in the parking lot, leave asap.  I couldn't smell bbq even when I was walking in the front door, but I still decided to give Pork On A Fork a try.  The second tip I was told was that a great bbq place always has sweet tea or at least decent ice tea, here I found an \"Out of Order\" sign taped over the ice tea machine!  Yup, a machine!    Still I said I would try this place and I did.  I got the pulled pork sandwich, and sides of bbq beans and  potato salad.  The beans were decent but I would suggest adding some brown sugar to them.  (Hey, my grandmother did that with her bbq beans and they rocked!)  The potato salad was boring and bland.  It didn't help that about half of the potatoes that were cut into small cubes were under cooked.  The pulled pork was a lukewarm mixture, either dry or VERY chewy.  The last piece I had tasted off and left a horrible taste in my mouth,  Also, I picked up a squeeze bottle from another table for some sauce only to find out the entire bottle had sauce all over the outside of it.  I ate in the dining area down the hall from where you order and it has ZERO bbq joint ambiance.  Music was playing but it was Bill Haley and the Comets followed by other 1950's rock and roll songs.  (BBQ joint or Johnny Rockets?)  There were three employees in the place and two of them passed my table several times but said nothing.  There were only four other customers in the place and they were together in a booth across the room.  When I left no one said anything to me.  (\"How was it?  Thank you!  Do we suck?\", etc.)  Judging from my review and other recent reviews, the owners need to get back in control of this place asap and return it to the great reviews it used to get."}
{"text":"Good BBQ and you can order online! Brisket is a little dry but their pulled pork, sauces, and sides are all really good."}
{"text":"Food is amazing the service has gone dramatically down hill in the last year. They are slow, don't go if you're in a rush!"}
{"text":"Great place and food. It's even better after the remodel. Service is always great here. Big and roomy dining area. I will continue to come here for my BBQ needs"}
{"text":"I was down for a three day visit  in Phoenix recently and ate the sweet potato fries 2 times a day. I could not get enough of them. They are great. All the other food is great also but the sweet potato fries are to die for."}
{"text":"Amazing food, pretty awful service. Basically walked in and they said \"ok what do you want?\""}
{"text":"This is a great place for BBQ . Authentic. Smoke flavor . Was informed they use pecan .i ordered the sampler plate   With 3 Meats .   It consisted of Brisket, pulled pork , chicken and sausage . 1st the brisket was very good flavorful and tender . The pulled pork was decent and had a good smoke flavor . Only complaint I have with it just. A little dry not much though .   The chicken was not bad good decent flavor with a hint of smoke . The sausage was also good and flavorful .this plate also came with 2 sides. I got the mac and cheese and potato salad ,No complaints they were both very good .   The staff was very friendly and seemed like they honestly cared about the product they put out . You can tell when a place puts there heart into something , and these guys do . It shows in the food .    Next time I'm back in. Phoenix I will be going back for sure you can count on that ."}
{"text":"I've eaten at PoaF plenty of times, sometimes multiple times in a week, and it is always great each visit. Hands down one of the best BBQ joints i have ever had, and i lived in Georgia for a little while. Going to head there this week to pick up a couple bottles of their BBQ sauce for some homemade fathers day ribs!"}
{"text":"I called in an order for chicken wings the day before and was eager to try them. When I arrived at the time they had told me, the nice girl working the smoker told me that there had been some kind of mix-up and my wings wouldn't be ready for a while. They were very nice about it and apologized for my inconvenience. While waiting, I ordered some additional items including some of their mustard based sauce. When my order appeared they were very gracious and gave me a 10% discount for my trouble. Unfortunately, the wings were grossly under cooked and they forgot to include the sauce I purchased. The wings were inedible. They tried hard but this will be the last time I order chicken wings from this place. A for effort but s big zero for quality."}
{"text":"last night we made the 20/minute drive to pick up dinner. not our first time, was so looking forward to the brisket and beans. brisket was ok, but way to salty. the beans were just ok too. in the past the beans were a meal by themselves, there was some small pieces t meat in the beans only. Mac and cheese a huge disappointment. BTW fill the to go sides to the top, feel like I only got 3/4 of a pint."}
{"text":"Just catered from POAF for a family birthday for 20 people.  Yelp did not let me down!  I hadn't eaten their bbq before so it was a bit of a gamble, but after reading reviews I decided to give it a try.  Everyone enjoyed the food and I can't wait to eat leftovers tonight.  I ordered pulled pork, pulled chicken, 2 racks of ribs, beans, coleslaw, and small mac&cheese.  The pork and chicken was smokey, tender and moist.  They even delivered on a Sunday when they are closed!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ, probably the best in the area! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness.!!! First time here and the customer service was great as well as the food. Ordered it online and it was prepared on time once I showed up."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the BBQ burrito!  And to really make sure you are in AZ just get the Spicy BBQ sauce to go with it."}
{"text":"I like the casual atmosphere and the food was decent.  Overpriced for what you get in my opinion"}
{"text":"Having sampled ribs from Chicago, St. Lou, KC & Mephis to the Southern & Texas style to say I've been disappointed by what I've found so far in Phx would be an understatement.  Until tonight.   The full rack was smoked to perfection and just enough sauce with just the right combination of sweet & heat.  The pork & beans actually had more meat than you'd find an a typical fast food hamburger and the sauce was mild enough that it didn't over power the taste of the beans.   The coleslaw was fresh with enough dressing to make it moist & tasty without drowning it.   Tucked back in an office/industrial complex the only thing this place needs to be a success is a more visible location."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome! Love that brisket .. Me and my son go in all the time ! I have never had a bad experience.. Top notch service .. Great environment.. And award winning food.. I will be going here for a very long time ! The only issue I have is my 3 year old son seem to think that Wes the owner is his dad. Very awkward when that happens .. But the food is worth the brief confusion ! Go Lions!"}
{"text":"I had been dying to try this place for a while now, but it's quite a drive from where I live. I finally decided to make the journey yesterday, and I'm glad that I did. The industrial feel to the dining room is a nice change from the norm, and the staff was very friendly. It took about 40 minutes for the brisket to be ready, but that was just a small hiccup in our experience. Anyway, I had the pulled pork sandwich, macaroni and cheese, and beans. The pork was delicious, especially when I bathed it in the sweet & mild sauce. The mac and cheese was amazing. The beans were my least favorite. They were great, don't get me wrong, but they were a little spicy for my taste. Still searching for the perfect BBQ baked beans...  My hubby had the sampler with pulled pork, chicken, and he got the brisket in place of the sausage for an additional $1.49. The chicken was really good, but the brisket was the star of the show. It was juicy and just overall an amazing chunk of meat. It did have quite a bit of fat on it, but it was still really good. I really liked the overall experience and see myself coming back in the near future. I don't think I'll come often because of the drive, but it's definitely worth some follow up visits!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about how great our experience was at this place.  We had a group of 10 for a family dinner, and sat in their dining area in the back of the restaurant.  They made sure we had everything we needed.  The food was incredible.  Some of the best BBQ we've had in Phoenix.  We tried everything:  ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and smoked sausage.  All were excellent.  Fries and slaw were awesome.  We'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came in today for lunch with some bros on our lunch break. The immediate smell you get when you step throughout the door is very welcoming. Brisket sandwich was excellent and of good size, Mac and cheese was off the hook! They have 4 different sauces, all unique. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Food and service was good. Food was limited due to busy day. Get there early to insure all menu items are available. Extremely fair pricing. We'll be back for the ribs."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to my by a friend. Said it was the best BBQS in the valley. I wasn't too impressed. The best thing I had on the menu was the bbq beans. Those I must say we're very good. The brisket, pulled pork and sausage seemed to be average. My daughter really enjoyed the ribs. And I would not recommend the chicken. The skin was tough and rubbery and the skin is usually my favorite part to eat. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're going strict for ribs and beans.   Not to mention the service wasn't the best either. The server forgot one of our orders."}
{"text":"I'm a BBQ lover. After seeing pork on a fork featured on tv, I had to try it. It is good old fashioned competition style. Just delicious. The beans have bacon in it which is always a plus. My girlfriend loves the BBQ burrito (she can't let go of her Mexican food obsession, even at a BBQ place) the combo platters are where it's at! The sausage is probably my favorite of the meats, however they're all equally tender and savory. They have 4 different sauces and all are delicious. I just wish they were open later! 8pm is way too early! But it's my go to BBQ spot for sure"}
{"text":"Back again with a group of friends from work. I can't control myself and got the pulled pork again. Still as good as the last time I was here.   I did get to try the brisket And it was very good and moist. I'd like to see a smoked turkey sandwich as an option.   Great to be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of BBQ in my life all over the world. The quality and quantity that you get at PoaF is hands down the best I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. I don't often say that BBQ that is available at a restaurant is better than my own backyard, but that is indeed the case here.  The pulled pork literally melts in your mouth, and the selection of BBQ sauces available make it the perfect sandwich, lol.   Sweet potato fries are the best I have ever had, and the baked beans are amazing. I have got brisket tips in there that are a mouthful by themselves!  Waffle fries are, as you might expect, phenomenal.  The only problem I have is that they only offer two sides with the meal, and I want to have all of them. Of course, with the size of portions you get that may prove physically impossible. I usually eat there at 1030 AM and don't eat anything else the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ and Mac and cheese.  Had the pulled pork which was so good and not sure what the spice mixture is that they put on the Mac and cheese but it really kicks it up a notch from regular Mac and cheese.  Glad to have found this place.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Best Barbeque in Phx. Great sauce, ribs and pulled pork. People are friendly and service is prompt. Only draw back is location so look for a address not a sign. I have eaten at many BBQ's in Phx. and it's the best followed by Hap's and then Honey Bears. I like the fact that if you fill out a birthday card they will send you a coupon for a treat around your birthday"}
{"text":"Not bad, a little pricey, great pork sandwich. The mac and cheese and bake beans sides are better than average. The four different BBQ sauces are also tasty. The burrito BBQ meal is also a great meal. Too bad we're moving, we would be there all the time."}
{"text":"Delicious food - everything was excellent except I wasn't wild about the sauce choices. I prefer a Kansas City style sauce, sort of a cross between their sweet and their smokey. Had the large sampler and all the meats were great. Had baked beans, potato salad, and an extra side of mac and cheese. Beans were very flavorful, mac & cheese was great. Service was beyond excellent -- Darius went the extra mile in service with a smile, even though it was almost closing time. Other staff were friendly too."}
{"text":"Pork on a Fork is bitter-sweet to me. Their staff is attentive, wholesome, and quick, and their service is what keeps me coming back. Although their dining room is in the back, they manage to still keep it clean, even during a heavy lunch rush. I love their macaroni and cheese, and their sauces are to die for. However, it seems that their brisket (which was my FAVORITE) is very inconsistent. One day it's tender, smokey, and delicious, falling right apart and melting in your mouth. Other days, like today, it is tough and flavorless. It is very cool to watch the staff cut and pull the meats right in front of you, but when you can see them struggling to cut tough, fatty, brisket with a dull knife, it doesn't get you very excited to eat. Then, when you do sit down to eat, it feels like you're chewing on rubber. Not pleasant. I wish that every time I go, the food was the same. I don't know what they do different, but I hope they can figure out how to fix it."}
{"text":"It's been so sad to witness the decline of quality and standards at Pork on a Fork. This used to be a go to place that we brought our out of state visitors, after our last visit today, we will no longer be patronizing this place. Usually we go for the pulled pork but this time it tasted like it was just cooked in a crock pot. There wasn't the usual smoky flavor that was associated with the meat. We also ordered the mac and cheese and to our dismay they have changed the recipe. Long gone is the cheesiness that made the mac and cheese good, now it's just a liquefied cream sauce that doesn't taste cheesy at all.  The afternoon that we went into the restaurant, it was utter chaos. There was no direction being given and it seems like everyone was just doing their own thing. The person who pulling the meat kept touching his pants with the gloves on. Luckily for us another girl came up to assist us with clean gloves or I would have walked out right there. When we went to the back the tables were all dirty. No one was seen cleaning up anything. Back in the day when they first opened, POAF really did have great BBQ. Now I think they need to take down the sign that's on the door, because they are definitely not the best of the valley anymore."}
{"text":"Had a great experience with Pork on a Fork this past weekend. I needed some food for a party, sent a message on Yelp and promptly received a reply. I called to place my order and Kylie was very helpful in answering all of my questions. We ended up going with 2 of the extra large family platters. Those are great because you get 4 different meats, so there's something for everyone. All of the meats and sauces were delicious! My guests ate every bite so the food was a huge hit! Great customer service and food, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Our first visit was amazing! We ate at the restaurant. The pulled pork was tender and juicy. We tried all of the barbecue sauces and like each one for its own unique taste. The Mac n cheese was unbeatable! The corn bread was moist. The waffle fries were crisp on the outside and fluffy inside.  Our second visit we ordered take out and ordered the exact same thing as our first visit since it had been so outrageously delicious. When my husband got home they hadn't packed any of the sides. Just our sandwiches. It was too far of a drive to go all of the way back to complete our order. It took 20 minutes on the phone for the girl to figure out a partial refund for the sides, so she ended up doing a full refund which was nice of her.  Our third trip we also did take out. The pulled pork was so dried out that it almost had a cotton like texture. The Mac n cheese tasted like it was a few days old and scraped from the bottom of the pan. The waffle fries were soggy. Maybe they just didn't handle the 15minute trip inside a styrofoam box well. They were out of corn bread and a few other things as well.  So, I'm not sure if this place lacks consistency or the quality had just gone down hill all together. Such a shame, because the first trip had our mouths watering!"}
{"text":"I had the beef brisket, pork, and chicken sampler. I had sweet potato fries and coleslaw on the sides. The coleslaw is not something I would order again. The sweet potatoes were good. It is the waffle fries that are full of flavor and they remain crunchy. The beef brisket was my favorite out of all the meats. The one I finished the first as well.. The chicken was second most moist and tasty and lastly the pork. The potato salad was alright ."}
{"text":"Get this place ever week  Love it  Delicious  Best BBQ around I highly recommend checking it out  Alittle out of the way  But it's worth finding"}
{"text":"Totally underwhelmed, tiny portions of mediocre food for big prices. Read the reviews, thought I'd try it out with my free dinner coupon from Uber Eats.  On the delivery menu the brisket and bbq sampler $13.11, you're prompted to add two meats (pulled pork and sausage for me) and two sides (Mac n cheese and corn bread) the price mysteriously becomes $21.10 plus tax and delivery.  It was free so I figured... Well, I was wrong, tiny portions of brisket and pork, half! of a so-so sausage and tiny boring sides. Save your money, you can do better at home. Never again Pork on a (tiny) Fork, never again."}
{"text":"I purchased a deal from Living Social and I'm sure glad I did. I would have never known about the place and I live in the area. I am not a BBQ \"expert judge\" i guess but like most people I have had it alot. In my opinion its the best I have had... Cant wait to go back..."}
{"text":"I was really excited about going here because we love BBQ. While the food was fine, the atmosphere was really off-putting.   The food: We went around 6:00 on a Friday and they were out of chicken and ribs. I don't know if this is a normal thing, but it was disappointing to not even try the meats we wanted to. We ordered 2 plates - 1) pulled pork, waffle fries and coleslaw 2) brisket, waffle fries and mac and cheese. The meat was served dry, as others have noted, and there are 4 different sauces to try. I didn't love any of the sauces, but the mustard based sauce was interesting enough for me to use on my meat. I think the seasoned waffle fries were the highlight (which is sad, really, as they were probably one of the only things here that comes to the store frozen...). I didn't care for the mac and cheese (tasted only of swiss to me) and the coleslaw was made with a pre-shredded mix and boring dressing. Nothing interesting about it. My husband thought the brisket was good, but didn't care for the chunks it was cut into, as he prefers chopped or thinner slices.   The atmosphere: Although I knew ahead of time that it was in an office-park type setting across from Deer Valley airport, I still felt weird eating here. Maybe it's more of a pick-up place? The restaurant was dirty and worn and the staff was unenthusiastic about being there.   Overall: Head over to Bryan's Black Mountain BBQ in Cave Creek instead. Although they have less side options available, Byran's has a better atmosphere and good food. I'm still waiting to find that knock-your-socks off BBQ in Phoenix, though!"}
{"text":"Great prices, great portions, outstanding  taste, great service. This place is is not your conventional dine in restaurant. When you walk in there doesn't seem to be a place for dine in customers but there is actually a nice dining area in the back with plenty of seating and 3 TVs.  If this is your first time here the ordering process can be slightly confusing but once you figure it out it actually works out quite well. Fantastic overall. Only negative is there is only one shared restroom for men and women which looks like it needs more frequent cleaning. But don't let that keep you away from this place."}
{"text":"It's been a lot of years since I've had pork this incredibly tender.  The Polish sausage was also prizeworthy.  The brisket was very good.  The downsides: the hot bbq sauce was good, as was the sweet one, but the \"North Carolina\" sauce didn't do much for me.  The cornbread muffin was dissapointingly miniscule."}
{"text":"We came in for a late lunch, only a couple diners at the time. So there was little wait. Our party of three ordered two of the midwest monster specials with pork, brisket, coleslaw, and jalapenos and one brisket sandwich with two ribs. We sampled a variety of sides: waffle and sweet potato fries, potato salad and mac n cheese.   We sat in the back and had the area to ourselves. We all agreed we liked that hot BBQ sauce best, so we used it on our sandwiches. The meat here is well smoked and very tasty. The ribs were really impressive. I love how the sauce carmelized the top but the meaty was filled with smokiness. The brisket crumbled into tender pieces, yum! Both variety of fries were good, the potato salad tasted like what you get at Sam's club, the mac n cheese was ok a bit too congealed for my liking. Overall, everything was quite good. Our only complaint was the bun. It's too soft and filmsy to support the sandwiches. Next visit, we'd prefer to order the meat by the pound and avoid the sandwiches all together."}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday May 28th 2016. Drove a long way to try this place out. I had the pulled pork. It wasnt bad. Average I would say. My wife had the ribs and she said they were a bit dried out. As for the bbq sauce, I could feel a slight burn from the seasonings but overall, the sauce had very little taste. And I use a lot of sauce.   For me, the real problem is as follows. As I stated above, we drove a long way to try this place. When we got there they had a sign on the door stating that a \"party\" was using the dinning room and all others must eat outside.  I work in the heat so the very last thing I want to do is eat in it. But we tried it. I wish we would have just gone somewhere else. The table clothes were stained up and disgusting. And sharing our meal with flies is gross. Never mind the 99 degree temp.  This place is average at best. I honestly dont know how it ever won Best of Phoenix one year."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever had. The macaroni salad and corn bread muffin was awesome also. I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"The folks at Pork on a Fork know how to do BBQ!  Great food - good service - casual environment.  Take-out is set up separately from the dine in area - which makes for a fast get in get out with your order.    Hats off to the boys from Nebraska!"}
{"text":"We can here looking for some good BBQ and WOW did we find it here. My dad is very hard to please when it comes to ribs and he was very pleased. I had pulled pork and it was so tender and good it just melted in my mouth. Our friend had the chicken and said the same."}
{"text":"The owners are from Nebraska and so am I so they automatically get points for being super cool like me. Everyone knows the coolest people in the world come from Nebraska and that is a scientific fact!  Now the food here isn't good....Its GREAT! This is by far the best barbecue in town and I've tried it all...Stacy's, Ric's, Honey Bears etc. They got nothin' on this place. In fact, I am going to eat there today. I'm getting the \"Smokin' Meal\". Its pulled pork, beef brisket and a piece of sausage. It comes with two sides and I recommend the potato salad. This potato salad is ridiculous. It tastes exactly like my Grandma used to make...authentic German potato salad. They have a variety of sauces to choose from which range in flavor and heat.   I don't dole out 5 stars very often but this place has always been very consistent. The quality of the meat and pork is what sets this place apart. I am sort of pissed though because a few weeks ago they made smoked prime rib and I missed out on it. How good does that sound? Mark my words, I will never miss out on that again.  GO BIG RED!"}
{"text":"Awesome Pulled Pork and Smoked Sausage.  The ribs are great and I love the Mac and Cheese with Waffle Fire.  We get our BBQ fix a couple times a month at minimum.."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and helpful, making good suggestions. The pulled pork and coleslaw were excellent (though I wish they had a Carolina style vinegar sauce to go with.) The baked beans tasted as if someone dropped the pepper shaker in by accident. Great if pepper is your favorite spice, but I will not order those next time. Absolutely plan to come back!  Update one year later: stopped in today and didn't realize it was 15 minutes before opening time until I tried the door and it was locked. Disappointed,  but since I had a lot to do today, I headed back towards my car rather than wait. Someone came running out to catch me and said, \"Please, come on in!\" Made my day!  Got the Midwest Monster to go, and it was incredible as always. Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. When this place first opened and the owner was doing all the cooking it was awesome. Now the owner isn't cooking. The BBQ isn't that great. The prices are higher and the amount of food is less. The Monster for instance was a huge sandwich and a huge hit. Now it's smaller and the meat isn't the same.  The taste is ok BBQ. No longer the BEST.  :-( and we've been going here for about 3 years."}
{"text":"Appearances can be deceiving! This bbq joint is in the middle of an industrial area that I drive by daily! North Phoenix lacks a good bbq joint... Well until today! I tried the bbq platter and for the price I'm quite satisfied. Not a fan of the potato salad but the meat and sauces were good! I'll be trying more items on the menu in the future."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! If your not sure what to get, try a meat sampler. You get to select which meats and side dishes you would like."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. I like their brisket, chicken and pork pulled. The employees were so friendly. They put together a table for seven   even though they were so busy on the Xmas' eve. Definitely not a fancy place to eat in since most customers do carry out."}
{"text":"Well, the food was served cold, the sandwich bread tastes like it was purchased from the local grocery store with the bag left open all morning, and the corn muffins are dry and tasteless. Now that I think about it, the whole meal is dry and tasteless. Maybe I went at the wrong time."}
{"text":"The staff were very friendly!   The beef brisket was excellent! Had the sampler and ribs and brisket sandwich....shared it of course!  Loved the sauces."}
{"text":"I had the bbq chicken sandwich Sunday at the Steel Horse event and it was AWESOME!!!  I can't wait to try again and again.  We even bought a bottle of bbq sauce to enjoy at home.  Truly enjoyed!!"}
{"text":"I'm from the Midwest and know my BBQ. This place totally knows what its doing!! super yummy and well priced! Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"The ribs are good unless you get some that are old.I've got ribs 4 times 3 times real good 1 one time they were old  and taste bad."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs until management gets it right...my first time I chalked up to working the kinks out because it was their first week; I give it a few more weeks and it was worse...  For starters the menu is deceiving and doesn't contain enough info to explain what each thing comes with. The service line is disorganized and quite gross - mixing of utensils, dirty service, prep area, and poor temperature control - food borne illness waiting to happen. Upon ordering a brisket sandwich the employee thought it was acceptable to put pieces of nothing but fat in basket to weigh as part of order. When I called him on it, he removed fat out and proceeded to do it again with the end part/trash part of brisket.  People in line behind me were as astounded as I was. After that, I cancelled order and left.   Eat there at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but I was not impressed.  Pulled pork sandwich was dry.  Waffle fries so oversalted I used my napkin to brush off the excess.  Macaroni was sloppy with way to much ??liquid.  Sausage dry.  Will not return."}
{"text":"When you have BBQ out its because there was no time at home. Or your away from home and need some comfort. If either, you are good here. Your standards are their standards. If you like it a certain way staff will ensure its to your custom. Even had a rib order that was not normal to their quality. After mentioning this to staff. Staff called management and it was pleasantly replaced."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place !!!!  Best barbecue in the valley !!!!  May have a little higher prices than other barbecue places, but it is well worth it !!!  Give it a try !!! My husband keep going back and it never leaves us disappointed !!!!"}
{"text":"Here having a birthday meal with my son. So yummy!!!! The staff are funny!! Great costumer service. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"I'd like to update my review after Jake from Pork On A Fork reached out to us.. He definitely made things right and I'm so glad we'll be going back! I'm not sure what happened the day(s) that we originally went but it's very clear that customers are valued at this location, and Jake did more than make it up to us. Everything was ready to go when expected, and the food is awesome. I can't say that I've had BBQ this good in Arizona, everything from the Mac & cheese to the BBQ sauce is wonderful. I'm super excited that we have a new place to go to while we're working, this might be my new fave!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I wish I could like it more than I do. They have a vast menu and quick service as you move down a Chipotle style line. Problem is I just haven't found any of their meats to be that amazing and their sides, other than the mac & cheese, are all just average. The mac & cheese is yummy though so I would recommend that.  Parking at this location can be a bit of a pain during peak times but there are quite a few 10 minute parking spots directly out front if you're here to grab takeout.  This is a good place if you want some quick BBQ but not where you go to get melt in your mouth 5 star meat."}
{"text":"Hands down best bbq I've ever had. Tracy,Krystal, and Karl gave the best customer service a guest could ask for    Food was really fresh and super tasty. Not to mention they support the troops by giving military discount!!!!!!!   Much love for this restaurant and the staff. They treat you like family. Will be back   Forever new customer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Huge shout out to the 3 of them. ( all-star team)!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  Location is odd cuz its in an industrial park.   I ordered the Midwest Monster. Portions were great. Loved the BBQ beans. Huge chunks of bacon. Can't beat that. Cole slaw could use more flavor. Either sweet it up or tang it up. Meats were very tender and juicy."}
{"text":"Midwest monster is what it's all about. Best bbq sandwich I have ever had. Great atmosphere and I love the garage doors in the back"}
{"text":"Yummy! Even though their name is pork on a fork (the pork is amazing!) I love love love their brisket, it's super tender and has a great smoke flavor, I love that they leave the sauce on the side, it honestly doesn't need it. If you're torn between sides, try the baked beans!"}
{"text":"Went a little after 12 on saturday and got a bit of everything chicken, sausage, ribs & shredded pork. I tried the Mac and cheese and sweet potato fries for my sides. Unfortunately the only hot thing on the plate were those fries.  Don't know if it was a one off but everything else was served at room temp. I have to deduct a star for the cold Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"We came to Pork On a Fork for lunch today. I've been there before and generally enjoyed the experience. However, there are several pros and cons to this place.   I'll start with the pros: The time from when you walk in to when you are eating was pretty quick compared to other BBQ places. They have good enough options to chose from and have a specialty sandwich called \"The Midwest Monster\". It's a combo of their pulled pork and brisket. If you don't know what to get, get that sandwich. The sides were actually excellent. I had the coleslaw and mac and cheese. Both were very tasty. I managed to escape at $13, which is actually pretty good for BBQ.   Now for the cons: The line situation is very awkward. They ask you to grab your drink first before ordering. This is fine, except the line is always too long and is wrapping around the lobby. People trying to exit the restaurant have to cut through people in line to get out. It also can be very confusing to first time diners. It's easily solved if they give you a cup at the register, and put the drink stand in the dining room. In line, they brought out a new pork shoulder to refill the containers and the server immediately pulled off the bark and threw it in the trash. I died a little on the inside when I saw that. I was going to do the midwest monster, but switched to the brisket when I saw that. That's one of the best parts, right in the trash! For the food, the brisket left much to be desired. It was dry, and overall lacked smoky flavor, but it did pass \"the pull test\". Sadly, I had to grab some sauce to assist the sandwich, not good. It's similar to other places that use gas/electric \"smokers\", you'll never get the same flavor as a good, wood fired BBQ pit.   Overall, it was \"just ok\" BBQ to me. I can't label it \"Best\" as they do, but its meets the need and I'm sure others will enjoy eating there."}
{"text":"Huge chunk of fat in my pork, which I was told was was the Lean one between  pork and brisket. Potato  salad was cold cold but full of red onion. The beans were still hard, undercooked,  but tasted ok. The pulled chicken  was not hot!  The tops of the bottles on every table table were filty! New place, won't  go back!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy good!!!  Awesome Baby Back Ribs !!  The best I have had anywhere."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Brisket is like butter. Pork is like cotton candy.  Meat comes out smoked without sauce. A variety of sauces are available."}
{"text":"Dammmmmmmm!!!!!!!!! That's some good BBQ. This is going to be my new BBQ spot. The price is right and they're not stingy with the meat. I would definitely recommend this joint to everyone. I will be back. Oh yea, I got to give a shout out to Daniel one of the coolest servers."}
{"text":"This is a very quant place. They have some really classic BBQ and their sauce variety is awesome!! The meat is to die for and they have a nice variety of sides. The brisket was very moist and delicious as well as the pork. This place is definitely one of my favorite BBQ places."}
{"text":"Coming from Texas, I dig some Q!  These guys know some Bar B Q.  The meats were juicy and had a smoke ring.  One of the most important factors.  Had all of the meats and did not experience one bad thing, except I was too full for desert.  Highly recommend my friends here, you will be extremely happy about your choice."}
{"text":"I would say keep driving past this way way over rated BBQ spot .. Ya ya there from the mid west but let me tell you., there not fooling this Iowa boy ! liquid smoke ! Let's just leave it at that .,, my sides where good all give them that..  The lil corn bread mini muffin was a joke !"}
{"text":"Best place to get BBQ in AZ! The brisket is so good...great sides-Mac n cheese and waffle fries are a fave! Hubby got the Midwest Monster last time and it was killer! They have a few sauce options that you can choose for yourself once your plate is dished up. Has big room in back and has a warehouse feel. Like the atmosphere. Think it's slightly costly for BBQ but worth it. Kinda nice you can enjoy a beer here too"}
{"text":"One of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've found in the valley. A bit pricey, but worth it. Its hard to find good BBQ in Phoenix. I'm very picky when it comes to pulled pork and this is my new favorite.I didn't know what to do when they closed Sir Charles. And have been on the hunt ever since. I work nearby and blew off going here since it opened. Man! What a mistake that was. Its full of Asshole out of towners so I suggest getting it to go. But definitely try them out."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, it saddens me to have to give this place 3 stars for my 2nd review. For 3 years this place was mouth-watering amazing. I don't know what's happened within the last year or so but the last few visits the food has not been consistent. The mac n cheese has been served lukewarm, they've started measuring the meat when in the past it was a handful of incredible meat. Now it's measured to almost an exact weight and the brisket was dry. They've changed the way orders are taken so it really slows things down. They don't have Coke or Pepsi products, just RC cola, tea, Squirt and other non memorable liquids.  Guys from Nebraska: please get this place back on track! You're heads got so big from a visit by Guy and Triple D that I think you're forgetting your roots. I'm giving it one more visit and if it's not back to being yummy, I'm boycotting you."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars after over 200 reviews? What gives? My wife and I visited Pork on a Fork today and we won't be returning. Not because we spent $40 on lunch. Not because the side of mac and cheese was over cooked and dry. Not because the cowboy beans didn't have any brisket in them. Not because my wife's brisket sandwich was tough and over cooked. The reason is the pork ribs. I ordered a full rack to find out if they could properly smoke and cook pork ribs. They failed. We had to fight hard to get the meat off those ribs. There was little if any moisture left in the meat. Adding some of the various sauces was on no help. My only explanation of the many outstanding reviews is that a lot of people haven't been to places like Coopers pit BBQ in LLano, Texas. Once you've had the gold standard of BBQ, you realize what is possible if you carefully and thoughtfully watch over your pork and beef while it is being slow cooked and smoked. I'm hoping to visit Little Miss BBQ in the coming weeks to test their award winning beef and pork ribs. They are about to open  in Tempe and my wife and I got to try their ribs at a Saturday open market and feel they may be the best hope for BBQ lovers in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ in the PHX metro area, if not the whole state. This place holds its own against the likes of Gates BBQ and Arthur Bryant's. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place a gone down hill since my last visit. Purchased the $11.00 sampler and when I got home and looked at it I was extremely disappointed. A spoonful of pulled pork and spoonful of chicken and half link.  Do not order this !!! I they were not so far away I would have taken it back and demanded a refund. See photo."}
{"text":"This restaurant is has pretty decent pork but they have awful customer service and one of the dirtiest restaurant I have been in. I have been in this restaurant several times and in the last 6 months it has gone down so much and the lack of caring in more than noticeable"}
{"text":"Been trying places around my work and when here for the first time. Yeah, I'm going to be going back a lot. Their brisket was amazing. Falling apart and flavorful, the macaroni salad was zesty, and the cornbread was gone. This is the BEST BBQ I've been in a while."}
{"text":"Wasn't blown away like I hoped.  Had the pulled pork with beans & coleslaw. The pork was the best part. It was so freaking tender & juicy, it's probably the best in AZ. The rest of the meal sucked. The bun was cheap & added nothing. The BBQ sauce tasted like A-1 thinned out with liquid smoke. The beans were out of a can. The slaw was on par with any you'd find at a grocery store deli. ...I will probably give them another shot, but there's better BBQ to be had in AZ."}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed with Pork on a Fork. I ordered the brisket sandwich and it was very fatty. I had to cut off the inedible fat pieces. The sides were decent but nothing amazing. Besides the food, the ordering was very unorganized. The assembly line and the menu does not flow well and I was cut in line without the cutter even realizing it! I will most likely not return to this establishment."}
{"text":"The barbecue sampler (pork, chicken, sausage) was excellent. The sauces were quite delicious too. We had 3 different sides: potato salad was good, the cole slaw was bland, like it needed salt or vinegar, and the baked beans were not very good. Overall the excellent barbecue meats will have me returning here."}
{"text":"The Sampler is great! Great smoke flavor. The variety of sauces are all good. Mac and cheese is awesome."}
{"text":"OK. Not terrible, but not great. I won't be back.  I had the sampler, as it was my first time and I wanted to try a little of everything. The meats are very juicy, but didn't have much flavor. BBQ is supposed to taste smokey (and sweet/spicy) but I didn't taste like BBQ. It tastes more like it was baked in an oven rather than over coals or a wood fire. In other words, the texture is excellent but the flavor is very lacking.  My sides were Mac n cheese and criss cut fries. Fries probably came from a big bag from Costco, not very good. Mac n cheese was fine.  The restaurant itself is not impressive. Weird layout as you order in front then walk past the kitchen door, two restrooms and into the back where they have tables (and another bathroom in the middle of the wall by the tables) Wobbly condiments table, dirty utensil and napkin dispensers; for a BBQ place I don't care too much about ambiance, but it should at least feel clean.  It is overpriced too. The sampler plate ($1.50 brisket substitute...why?) And a drink came out to $16 and change. I can get a full pound of brisket and a drink at Rudy's for the same price.  Its out of my way anyway but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I used to like (not love) this place.  Tonight I dined in and was served half the portion size I used to get.  Along with the decrease in serving sizes, the price has gone way up.  What was even worse is I paid 1.50 for a mini muffin corn bread.  Totally pathetic.  The young girl at the register said the prices weren't made by her... It's the companies fault.  lol..  Guys... Raising the prices and giving smaller portions will put you out of business for sure.  You're location is bad, the interior is dirty, food sub par and employees young and careless..."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ and amazing sides to go with! This spot is in an industrial building but don't let the location fool you this is high quality. Loved the home made sauces the zippy mustard glaze is my favorite. We got the regular family platter... Defiantly was enough food for us four adults. It was our first time here so this platter was a perfect way to get and try all the meats. I would take a picture to show off the food but it was gone as soon as it hit the table... Amazing! we will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent brisket and pulled pork. Crazy Jay's BBQ sauce very spicy and very good!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. MAC n cheese cold. Cole slaw was grose. Baked beans were good. It wasn't so much the food but the delivery was sloppy. The bar b que sauce spilled all in the bag making quite a mess!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite BBQ place. There's lots of good BBQ places but this one it a little different. The food quality is as good as any and the flavor is the best. Love the sauces. The people and the low prices here take it over the top. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"OMG! I was craving BBQ and googled BBQ near me... Pork On A Fork popped up, and I was shocked I never seen this place before.... But! That pulled pork sammich I had yesterday was DELICIOUS!!!! Now I have to try the ribs that I am most certainly sure are amazing as well ! Trust I will be back today. #MarkMyWords :) Good job everyone there! Let me add, you will be kept happy while in line. They are cheerful and just happy to be of assistance ! They welcome your upbeat, energized spirits to the fullest ! Thank you again for such great service."}
{"text":"The service was pretty terrible, employees made it feel like it was an inconvenience that they had to get food for a to go order. When I requested for waffle fries the young girl sighed and asked another employee if they had enough for me to order them. Portions were skimpy for the price you pay. The food was good quality, pretty standard for BBQ expectations. Overall, it's worth a try once but I'm not sure if i will be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious.    Tried the sampler platter.    Meat tender and juicy.   Service great.    No complaints.   All positive."}
{"text":"Have not been there in several months. The one thing that stands out most is that the food is overpriced for the meat portion. The side dishes are generous. Ordered one portion of brisket which was not enough to feed one hungry person, got more but of course had to pay additional cost. However, brisket was delicious. Not sure if we will return."}
{"text":"I managed to scoop up two humongazoid pork chops from their booth at the Downtown Phoenix Market. I also got to sample the smoked pull pork. The pork was awesome, perfectly smoked and moist. I took the chops home to grill up and man was I a happy camper. The chops were bone-in, and just perfect. You could taste the quality in the pork, I'll be buying these chops again. Way to go Pork on a fork, you got skills"}
{"text":"This is a new location, their second (the first is just south of Dear Valley Airport).  And this was my first visit to either location.  It was very clean, as it should be being brand new.  The brisket was excellent. Good quality meat, nice deep smoke ring, good crust. They were out of pork (how could that be?) so I had a sausage link which was nothing special. The potato salad was quite good. The beans were not up to the quality you get at Honey Bear's, but OK.  On the sign they listed Coke products for fountain drinks, but the fountain actually had Kalil products (RC Cola, for example).  I will go back, if only to find out if the pork is any good."}
{"text":"The overall meal was great. I had the sampler. The chicken and pork were very good. The brisket dried out before I got it. This is too bad because they do a nice with it. Most day the guys rate a five. The staff enjoys what they do and it shows. Get here early and dine in the back room while your food is hot."}
{"text":"After my last review, I received a response from the owner, Justin. I had my hopes up that he would take the bull by the horns and  things would be much improved. In that spirit, I returned to POAF on 9/28. Mondays, as a rule, aren't too busy. Therefore, it makes sense that the staff would have the time to be diligent.  I was hoping for a brisket sandwich, beans, mac n cheese and a Dr Pepper. This is typical barbecue. At 12:15 pm on a Monday, I was told that they had run out of brisket! I settled for half a rack of babybacks and the aforementioned sides. BTW, POAF's soda dispenser was out of Dr Pepper. I settled for sweet tea.  The babybacks were smoky, a bit chewy and hung on to the bone -- and they were almost room temperature. The beans were good and spicey. There were a couple of scraps of meat in the beans. However, not as much meat as there once was. The mac n cheese was, as usual, very good.  I'm trying to be supportive and understanding. I really am. However, I just don't understand how a barbecue joint runs out of brisket, on a Monday, before any real lunchtime rush. It's these missteps that have become emblematic of my trips to this establishment. I worked my way through college in a hotel kitchen. I watched the prep chef get fired over not having a steamship round ready on time. I'm wondering who was in charge of smoking briskets and if they still have a job....   Management has to solve these problems. One day, there's no meat in the beans. The next time, there is meat in the beans, but not as much as there used to be. Lastly, a failure to adequately prepare enough of one of your signature menu items to get through a Monday lunch is inexcusable. The problems here are a failure of leadership. I don't blame the laborers. I blame management and ownership for this carelessness.   I hate to say it, but it almost seems like POAF is coasting on it's reputation."}
{"text":"Better than other so called smokehouses in the area. First couple times in food was excellent but the smoked meats are starting to lack in smokey flavor. Sides are the same and excellent. BBQ sauce choices are good.  Ambiance could use some help.  Again what happened to the smoke?!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!   Very clean place with friendly staff.   I had the pulled pork and homemade mac n cheese.  Yum!  Highly recommend this place.  I'll be back for sure:)"}
{"text":"Place is really good! Love the Mac and cheese and baked beans! The pulled pork sandwich was great also! Too bad it's in the opposite side of town from where I live! I would eat here once a week if I could!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!!!  I haven't had anything here that wasn't spectacular.  Try the Mac n Cheese!"}
{"text":"I've never been impressed with BBQ in Arizona until now. Sure, Lucille's has those amazing biscuits served with apple butter; those things are good.  BobbyQ's has those cute little donuts, and Honey Bears makes a great sweet potato pie.  But until I finally got to eat at POAF I have never been impressed with the meat in this town.  As far as slow smoked meat, forget about it. It really doesn't exist in Arizona as far as I can tell.  But now we have POAF.  POAF is amazing in every regard.  Their large smoker is in the middle of the restaurant (which is more of an industrial warehouse converted into a meat-eating complex) and when you walk in you smell that amazing smoke.  You can see the smoke loft up the vent. It smells sooooo good.  On the window outside it say \"Competition Style Barbeque\" which really says a mouthful.  First, you gotta have some serious swag to declare that what you're putting out is competition worthy.  You're placing yourself into the category of those artist smokers who dares to compare their wares to other fanatics.  What it really means is that they don't serve their meat with sauce, and you gotta have some real confidence in your product to do that.  When the meat stands alone without the sauce, which POAF's does, then you know you've got something special. You can add your own sauce from a great selection. Let me tell you about the meat.  We had the brisket, which in all honesty is the best brisket I've ever had in my entire life, hands down.  Now I come from a long line of Jews and we know brisket; we eat it pretty much on every holiday.  Take a look at the pics I posted.  The smoke on this brisket is amazing.  They cut it perfectly.  It melts in your mouth with a great texture. The flavor is \"wham-bam-thank-you-maam\" with or without sauce. In short, it is brisket perfection.  That baby back ribs were also fantastic. The smoke ring can be seen.  This is the dark outer layer on top of the pink meat.  The contrast of the outer smoke ring with the pinker meat makes some people think it's not cooked thru, but that is not the case. These babys are smoked to perfection.  The best part of the baby backs is that they serve them in a puddle of their AMAZING mop sauce. The mop sauce is the best part and I'm told it's made fresh.  The mop sauce is not available in bottles unlike their barbeque sauce.  This mop sauce is thick and sweet and truly my favorite part of these ribs. Mop sauces are usually thinner; this is thick. If you don't order the ribs, ask for some mop sauce to go with whatever you did order.  The baby backs were not the best I've had in my whole life, but probably some of the best in Arizona. They left the membrane on the underside; I prefer to have it removed.  Only true baby back Q'ers will know what I'm talking about regarding this membrane.  The owner told me they usually remove it, but it depends on whose putting the slabs into the smoker.  Again, these are truly smoked and amazing. The best smoked ribs in town.  I am equally impressed with the sides we had. The Mac-and-Cheese was probably the best Mac I've had at any Arizona BBQ place hands down.  The sweet potato fries were thick and piping hot, just how I like them.  The coleslaw was nice and lite; it did not distract from any of the meat, and the corn muffin was just okay (I would go up one size on the muffin - it was kind of small and we BBQ folk like things big!).  The red velvet cupcake was highly respectable.  I am so happy to have amazing smoked meat in Arizona. I LOVE POAF. Oink!"}
{"text":"Talk about a disappointment. Good barbecue shouldn't require slathering it with sauce due to all moisture being cooked out of it. We tried the chicken, brisket, and the pulled pork. As someone that makes barbecue this may have been my worst experience in Phoenix. Just felt like I was chewing on leather coated in too much barbecue sauce.   Now, the barbecue beans were good and mac and cheese was ok. Never again."}
{"text":"Highly satisfied with excellent food and service tonight. The camelback location is clean and well taken care of by staff.  First time visit had me blown away. Customer service was exceptional.  Food was very impressive with taste and quality ingredients. Can't wait to visit again! I had the Midwest monster sandwich with waffle fries and the Mac n cheese. The meat has great smoke flavor you don't expect from a small strip mall place however it was phenomenal. The sauce selections will blow your mind. Try the mustard BBQ sauce... The waffle fries are amazing,crisp and fresh. Not to mention the serving is huge.  Mac n cheese is creamy and just the way it should be.  They have draught beer and bottled. So good  Cornbread muffins are to die for!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for the last 3-4 years, quality has been going downhill. I can understand with the popularity that the quality would decline a bit but not like it has. Today was the straw on the camels back and I will not be returning. The girl cutting the meats with glasses was pretty rude to us and the people in front of us were pissed off too. The brisket that was about to be put on my plate was so much fat and not much meat, gross, the people behind me ended up getting that in their lb to go, thanks for asking if I didn't want it (the reason I gave it two stars). I got ribs which were dry as heck, i have jerky that's more tender. They now only give you one bbq sauce per sandwich, i fel like I was getting nuggets at McDonald's. I'm from around the Kansas City area and was so happy I found bbq that reminded me of home, good luck poaf I hope you improve things."}
{"text":"Normally excellent right? Beware of carry out however as there is no notice when they run out of food. The Midwest Monster was more of a monster disappointment as they left off the queso and coleslaw making it.....a $12  sandwich? When we called to ask the reply was they were not willing to refund. Really disappointed more in the lack of service than anything."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years but have never left a review. I have had mixed feelings over the years. I've tried just about everything but I am going to keep my review to one thing. They used to do prime rib Fridays quite a while back once a month and then discontinued it. It was amazing. We were monthly regulars. The quality of the meat and the flavor you can only get when its been lovingly smoked/roasted for half a day or more. It was a good value with asparagus and a side. I am really happy they have brought this tradition back. It seems they have kicked it up a notch or two as well. Now you get a loaded potato and a side with your 10oz.+ portion of rib. I asked, I noticed them weighing it to make sure the portions were right. This last time I ordered the mac and cheese with my dinner. They must have had an off night on the mac as it was bland as could be and had almost zero flavor of cheese. A dash of the rub they put on top saved it. I also got the beans. Super tasty but I miss having a piece of pork now and then mixed in. But getting back to the star of the show, the prime rib. Although its technically not \"prime\" rib, but most likely a choice cut, it is still wonderful. As I mentioned before I am no novice to their rib night AND I am a pretty big eater. So I decided to ask for a double order. I had them cut a double thick slice of prime rib and double everything else like it was two orders. If you compare something like this to any big prime rib cut you get at a steak house this is an excellent value and I encourage any big eater to do the same! Kudos PoaF for bring back our favorite!"}
{"text":"I had a very good dinner from them! I got the Midwest Monster and it was very flavorful  and I was very happy I got extra BBQ sauce with it for the extra juiciness. Needless to say I will be back for more items on their menu."}
{"text":"Disappointed, we took a chance and went with pork on a fork for dinner, nearly an hour before closing, and we called ahead for our order. The order ended up being cold, we didn't even end up with the meats we selected (our surprise not knowing this until we had already been home) and on top of that all the food was pretty much the leftovers of the day, I know it's an hour before closing but it's no excuse for poor food and service, the Mac and cheese is what held me on with my bad experience last time but even that was awful this go round I'm truly disappointed :("}
{"text":"! had lunch here with a couple of fellow yelpers  and we all had a great lunch.I had the Pulled pork sandwich (good), waffle fries (real good) and the baked beans (great) . Everything was pretty good the only thing I can really complain about is my pulled pork sandwich would have been better if the bun was thrown on the grill for a minute to warm it up and toast the buttered side. That would have gotten them the fifth star. I am sure they will get it the next time I go there because a girl at the next table got B.B.Q. chicken and it looked awesome, I thought I should have ordered that, next time I will try the chicken and I am sure they will get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Strike three for Pork On A Fork last time dried out ribs to no ribs at all this is the second time I've come and they are out of ribs and they made it out to be my fault cause I didn't call in to hold ribs for me. If you ran out at lunch time and I'm coming at dinner time ya think those ribs are gonna be juicy and yummy nope dried out. Sorry but your not worth my families trip there anymore or my co workers off to hunt for another BBQ place."}
{"text":"Oh boy!  An abbreviation like POAF deserves a visit.  I am going to TRY to keep this short and simple due to the amount of people that may check this place out.  We came around 7 pm and the hospitality was great being greeted with a smile and recommendations on entrees and sides.  Therefore, we got the brisket sandwich and half slack of ribs with waffle fries, mac n cheese, cornbread, and the baked beans as sides.  Oh dang, you are getting excited, aren't you?  I believe coming late meant the food was not that fresh.  The food came out immediately and the brisket was chewy and dare I say dry with a little lack of flavor.  Don't hurt me POAF.  I am hoping this was due to the fact it was later in the evening.  As a result, I drenched that extra BBQ sauce on my sandwich.  Extra BBQ sauce?  You got that right, 4 different kinds to satisfy your taste buds!  My wife said the ribs were similar to my brisket.  However, we did enjoy the baked beans that had a meaty flavor with the pork mixed in.  Overall, I will have to try this place again.  Maybe a little earlier.  I am basing my 3 stars that the price is expensive and all the hype.  I looked at a menu at another popular BBQ SIT DOWN restaurant, and POAF was only a bit lower.  Therefore, if I am going to spend this much, it would be at the sit down.  Although, this is to be continued pending my next trip for a fresher experience.  I will see you again POAF!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from Pork on a Fork thru Grub Hub. The delivery time took almost 90 minutes.  I realize this is most likely the GH drivers fault.  But the food was nothing spectacular, I ordered a 4 meat sampler, with beans and potato salad. The sampler comes with pulled pork, brisket, pulled chicken, and a small piece of hot link. It was all in a ball wrapped in foil and all mixed together so it all tasted the same.  It should be kept separate so one can enjoy the flavors of each individual meat. The baked beans were killer, and the potato salad was ok."}
{"text":"We stopped in for some bbq yesterday- I'm already planning my next trip! The ribs were basic, kind of over cooked. The beans were very meaty, unlike the beans sans meat we ate catered a few weeks ago. The Mac and cheese noodles were turning mushy (not very fresh). The brisket was pretty good. The sauces were darn good. Half pound brisket for $10, Mac and cheese came at a surcharge price for \"premium\" side, and no corn bread or Texas toast... Rack of baby backs $25.... Pretty steep price. Missing that real bbq experience without cornbread or bread to mop up that sauce! For a bbq joint in a desert strip mall, I'll give it 3 stars. The customer service was 5 stars! The Midwest is alive in that place- love it! We'll be back to try more food and hopefully get a 5 star quality experience."}
{"text":"This place smells like Morbid obesity and happy place dreams.  I was sooooooo impressed with the food!  The pork is flavorful, moist, tender, expertly cooked and seasoned and paired with a delicate bread.  I added Mac n cheese and it was also wonderful!!  I just came from Charlotte and it rivals the best from there!  Don't let the strip mall facade fool you.  If someone gives this place negative good reviews they are stupid....  This they can do better: home brewed sweet tea and lemonade. Get some!  Collard greens done well with fatback!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp!  It is quite a task to find a good BBQ place in the North Valley and without you guys, we wouldn't have found this place.  Very friendly staff and great pork.    The sauces are not my favorite, but that is just me. Mac and Cheese rocks.  Planning to introduce some friends next weekend."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. I had the pulled pork sandwich with mac & cheese and waffle fries. The pork was dry, bun was soggy and the noodles in the mac & cheese were hard. The waffle fries were good. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Brisket and ribs, brisket and ribs, brisket and ribs.  Did I say brisket and ribs?       As a certified BBQ judge, I am very picky about my BBQ.  That having been said, I have traveled 20 minutes each way many, many times to eat here.  As you might guess my favorites here are the brisket and ribs.  Both have a very nice texture with enough smoke flavor to make any BBQ fan happy.  For the sides I will normally get the mac & cheese and the sweet potato fries.  Both are real palate pleasers."}
{"text":"It's all about the beans for me!  Pork on a Fork has the best baked beans EVER, with great flavor and chock full of smoky meaty bits!  I've been there just once, and had ribs and sweet potato fries in addition to the beans.  Ribs were okay, but a bit over cooked (dried out on the ends). They had several sauce options, all okay, but none made me say \"wow\". Sweet potato fries were a little underdone and soggy for my taste. Their new schedule is frustrating - when I go for BBQ, I'm generally looking for ribs, but they offer ribs only for 2 hours on Friday evenings.  (What's up with that?!!)  Pork on a Fork is on the opposite side of town from me, but I will drive there again just for the beans."}
{"text":"So, the meat was awesome! We got a big sample platter and I loved it all! Brisket, pulled chicken,  pulled pork,  sausage,  with Cole slaw, and sweet potato fries.  Then we had the mac and cheese and beans on the side. To me, the meat was the best... the sides were good,  but nothing special.  Price was great and service too... only thing I didn't really like was that it felt like I was sitting in a cafeteria. I really miss a restaurant that doesn't feel like a quick in and out atmosphere. A lot of places feel like fast food and this place was really cold feeling and kind of like a high school gymnasium. It doesn't make me want to hang out,  but I'll take some meat to go!"}
{"text":"I am an admitted BBQ snob.  I have lived in places that make BBQ an out of body experience...so with that being said this place is AWESOME.  I mean AWESOME.  Me and the bf drove about 20 minutes out of the way to check this place out and so glad we did.    I got the meat plate and the bf got the bbq sandwhich.  He is a very non excitable man and he has not been able to stop raving about this damn BBQ all day.    My experience was quite the same.  With the beans and sweet potato fries as sides (and might I add probably the best sweet potato fries I have ever eaten) this place is top notch.  Why not the 5 stars?  The service is non existent and it's a do it for yourself kinda place.  This place is a MUST TRY!!!!"}
{"text":"This is our second time visiting. The food was so-so, but our big complaint was the wait. We stood in line for at least 30 minutes. The servers were extremely slow! Weighing the food doesn't take that long! Bringing new pork from the back-taking the wrapper off was the Biggest ore deal. Not having certain food is crazy as well. That has happened both times we have been there. Honestly, it became comical after this long of waiting."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING! And WAY OVERPRICED I am not trying to be a hater here, I just call 'em like I see \"em or in this case see and taste 'em! Now to be fair I have to admit we did arrive there Friday at just a little after noon so they were definitely busy but having to wait over half an hour just for some tattooed twenty something employee to get some pre-cooked food out of the steam table and into a Styrofoam togo box is just a tad excessive! The first 15-20 minutes of the marathon wait I was entertaining myself swatting at the swarm of flies that were buzzing about this fine industrial park establishment. But that charm wore off after awhile and I decided to check on my order as I could clearly see that people who had ordered food after I did, were already served. So when I inquired with the tattooed boy wonder behind the counter he assured me that my order WAS ONLY another five tickets back and should be up in about 5 minutes. Well about 10 minutes later there it was: a Styrofoam box of the most bland, boring and dry BBQ meat I have ever paid $13 for the displeasure of trying to choke it down!!  Not even one of the mundane BBQ sauces they had in pumps could make this arid, dull, flavorless pork, chicken and beef combo come to life. Oh and by the way you pay an extra buck for their dried up brisket!  Really, who cares about the obviously paid for plug from DDD just skip it, you can do better just about anywhere- AND save a few bucks as well!!  THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE"}
{"text":"Searching for BBQ, I wasn't expecting much since PHX isn't a BBQ town other than old, fat, retired hogs roasting in the desert.   But I had to try Pork on a Fork, if only to say, \"This little piggy is going to Pork on a Fork!\"  The $11 Smokin' Sampler included pulled pork, smoked sausage, and chicken with choice of two sides.  The tender pulled pork also came with a warm, soft dinner roll to make yummy mini sliders.   The half smoked sausage link was just that - a smoked sausage link without much excitement for texture or exotic flavors.  The chicken thigh was lightly basted in sweet BBQ sauce - not my preference, but the baste was light, so it was easily masked with the available BBQ dipping sauces (sweet, vinegar-based North Carolina, mustard, or hot).  The delicious mac & cheese had oversized macaroni pasta and was slightly seasoned.  The waffle fries were particularly yummy, even worthy of being a standalone snack.  WIFI and FREE fountain drink with Yelp check-in when ordering.   Great friendly service, as I still got the freebie even though I checked in after ordering, and the staff came out from behind the counter twice to ask how we were doing.  The only downside is the indoor location in a boring business park, as I was expecting a small roadside shack with some picnic tables and the smell of smokey BBQ for miles around.  But that could be a good thing because this fat little piggy wasn't slowly roasting in the Arizona sun while stuffing his face.  OINK OINK."}
{"text":"What a difference! After a being contacted by POAF Mgmt - We gave it another try and....  Excellent! The ribs were back to their meaty and delicious old selves! Racks were evenly cooked and juicy! Mac and cheese was creamy with just a perfect hint of spice. Sauces were great too!  Staff was very friendly and attentive as well.  Yup, it is only our first return visit and time will tell if these high levels are kept up but, we are more than happy to stop by over and over again this summer to make sure the ribs stay crazy good!  Thanks POAF - Welcome Back!!"}
{"text":"A review for this place is long over due. I came across POAF reviews by accident just now, but once I saw they had a few bad reviews that we're all kind of the same. Ex. POAF used to be good now it's bad. I wanted to chime in as well.   They are totally coasting now off of regulars, I've been going for a couple years now and it was great at first. Now I totally agree with the other reviews.   First off, they have to be mad profitable. So why all of a sudden are they weighing the meat out. I used to not be able to finish the sampler. Now it's no problem. The pork (which should be a staple of your food line up) is way different now. Dry. Brisket is still always the best. Everyone knows that, but they're stingy with it now. Beans are good, but like the other reviews say, there is no consistency. Sometimes it has  an abundance of meat and sometimes none.   The staff. All are friendly. However, are they overwhelmed or something?? They mess up some easy details. Management should actually simplify the menu believe  it or not. Yes I know it's not a huge menu, but they can't handle the subs on sausage, chicken, ect. They are soooo slow now too. Weighing out meat takes them too much time. Good call management. (Sarcasm) Or phone orders with two tabs; one time I told the employee exactly what I ordered and what I would like to pay for and she charged me for the wrong one. (This was two separate tickets.) I'll still be back, brisket is all I get now. The double barrel of course. The price is always different too. Once again, no consistency.   When I go I always go with the mindset of what will the issue be today? After I eat the food though, I forget about the problems, but still, take some pride in your business. Especially when you have so many loyal customers."}
{"text":"So a cafeteria style bbq place where you place your order on one side & pay at the other. Had the baby back ribs and pulled pork. Both were very tender & the meat almost fell off the ribs without trying. Side salad was basic w/ dressing in small plastic container. Baked berms were average. Lots of black pepper to try and develop flavor. Coleslaw was okay too w/ little dressing to hold together.  The meat is what shines. Was hoping for traditional corn on the cob too but that is not offered. I'd go back but just for the meat. I'd get my sides elsewhere & take out."}
{"text":"This is Seriously some of the best BBQ I've ever had! I used to eat this at least twice a month because I worked around the corner and now I miss it so much! Any BBQ place I eat at I start by having the pulled pork and branch out from there, because if they can't do the basics I don't want to try anything else. The pulled pork here is outstanding and the portions are huge for what you pay. Some good sauces, not the best ever, but definitely presentable. The brisket was moist and flavorful, you can tell it's truly smoked. The sides are so-so, no Mac n cheese, which is weird. Where this place truly shines are their smoked meats, which is what barbecue is all about!"}
{"text":"I am a BBQ guy. I have traveled throughout the south and have had some really great BBQ in the Hill country of Texas. That became my threshhold whereby all others would be judged and compared. Having just moved to the Phoenix area I wanted some BBQ and read all the yelp reviews and decided I would try POAF.   I ordered their Smokin Sampler and sub'd for the brisket. First the good: Their smoked pork is really, really good. Some of the best I've ever had. I give that a 5 star. Their brisket is good but not among the best I have tasted = 4 stars. The Polish sausage is a great brand = 5 stars. I was really looking forward to trying their smoked chicken that was included in the sampler plate but they were OUT - in the middle of the dinner rush at 6:30pm???!!! The person who brought out the plate apologized as he handed out the meals and said they ran out so they substituted a Polish sausage instead which is is exactly what I DIDN'T want. I paid an upcharge to have chicken, pork and beef brisket and got a polish sausage? I was not a happy camper so I asked to have some additional brisket to compensate - to which they agreed. The chicken (or the lack thereof) = 1 star. The two sides were baked beans and coleslaw which were bland and mediocre at best = 1 star x 2. The slider buns were not fresh baked and served at room temperature. Just steaming them would have been better = 1 star. The various BBQ sauces (of which I tried them all) were nothing to write home about = 3.   The cleanliness of the dinning room(s) was horrific. Perhaps the smoker was not venting properly?? The walls, ceilings and floors were in desperate need of a deep cleaning. I was afraid to check out the bathroom... = 1 star.   Totall score 2 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I first visited Pork on a Fork a few months ago and it was amazing. The service wasn't the best but the delicious BBQ made up for it. We have been dying to take my mom so this past Saturday we decided to let her check out this hidden gem. Unfortunately our experience was absolutely HORRIBLE. The individuals working had us repeat our order at LEAST 6 times and then they still didn't get it right. It seemed like some of their friends came in and their focus shifted to their wants/needs. We followed the rules and ordered our french fries at the beginning of our order. When we went to pay, they forgot to charge us and then proceeded to charge us but never made the fries. We had to go back and remind them that we ordered them. A few of the workers didn't know answers to basic menu questions. The food came out and the meat was extremely dry and such a disappointment. It seemed like the pork had been in a crockpot all day and needed to be lathered in sauce. The sides had very little flavor. The overall quality was extremely poor and I am so disappointed. We will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Got a pulled pork sandwich. Service was very friendly. Plenty of meat on my sandwich and I loved the sauces. Meat had a nice flavor but could have been slightly more warm. Fries were great. Corn bread average. Went for the meat and was very happy with it. I will be back. My buddy said the mustard bbq sauce was one of his favorites he has ever eaten. The bathroom was clean and had a great foam soap."}
{"text":"First couple times I went here it was delicious. The last 2 times I went the beef brisket was low quality and real fatty. Has no flavor ever since they switched to lower quality meat"}
{"text":"Awesome food at Pork on a Fork!  The pork is so moist and tender.  And the brisket and chicken and ribs are so tasty!  You gotta love this place.  Their customer service is exceptional.  Whoever smokes the meat really knows their craft.  If you want great BBQ...please go to Pork on a Fork!...btw...I loved their bbq sauces too. And Matt Beard  is a very friendly catering mgr.  - Doug Howitt"}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service! My favorite BBQ place. The Prime Rib they occasionally have is so delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First time trying, ordered through Uber Eats. So far so good. And my son inhaled the Mac & Cheese. Fork optional..."}
{"text":"This place is average, and quiet honestly overpriced. The big boy platter is small, and stay clear of the beef brisket. The best part was the Mac and cheese and the portion for that is tiny! Hard pass on coming here again. People were cool though."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have had in Phoenix! I have been many times and have yet to have a bad experience. Everything on the menu is good, the sides are amazing and I can get enough of the BBQ sauces they have."}
{"text":"Pros:  good service tasty meats yummy sauces (love that they are on the table to try) great fries and beans  Cons: dry mac and cheese  out of chicken nuggets (we have four kids, so this was a bit of a sticking point) pricey!  3 kids meals and two adult meals with drinks cost $50.  Honestly, I just don't think it was worth it.  Tasty, but not THAT great."}
{"text":"I want to tell everyone about this place, but then I don't want there to be a line out the door when I go there myself.  Such a dilemma!  I first read about PoAF in the AZ Repub and being a lover of anything BBQ'd and delicious pork, this was on my list of places to try.    My husband and I were out in the Deer Valley Airport area one day and I saw their sandwich board sign on the road and made him turn around and stop.  Didn't matter that it was barely 10am.  I had to try it.  Just getting out of the car, the smell of the BBQ made my mouth water.  Can I get that in an air freshener?  I had the basic pulled pork sandwich - no sauce.   It was amazing.  It was better than amazing.  I did not share it.  Hey, he could have ordered his own!  The sweet potato fries were a great side, adding just enough sweet in between bites of the sandwich.  I was in heaven.  I did share the fries.  Kind of.       The only downside to this place, for me, is that it's a bit of a drive from where I live.  But, since I'm able to buy the pork by the pound, when I'm there I make sure I stock up.  I have tried the sauces.  All of them are really good.  But when the pork is this good, it's really not necessary."}
{"text":"First time here and decided to get the Brisket with 2 sides ( Mac 'n Cheese and BBQ beans) The food was very good but took a Star away as the price was high - $12 n change without a drink!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I get the BBQ burrito every time and it's awesome! The portions are huge and include your choice of two sides which are delicious. Mac and cheese is my favorite. This place reminds me of a chipotle where u walk up and order exactly what you want down the line which is great for the fast paced lifestyle or if you just want to sit down and have a nice meal. Also, the sauces are delicious. Try them all."}
{"text":"Came here with the wife on a Saturday for lunch. This location is a little hard to find since it is not facing the street. Good thing they had those sailboat advertising thingies out on the road to help guide my stomach.  Inside and out are pretty industrial. Lots of concrete and unfinished ceilings to look at while eating. The front section is very small with a tiny seating area. The back section is larger and set up with giant TVs and enough area for several families or large groups.  Service was a little confusing. It seemed hard to get answers for what I was asking. Just had a few simple questions. Maybe it was a training day or something. We are not talking rocket science here. Then again it was my first time there also. Maybe I was the one confused. Ha!  The wife wanted a 2 pc Combo Plate but they do not offer one. You have to order the Sampler Plate which is 3 Meats and make 2 of the 3 choices the same. What? I ordered the Midwest Monster Sandwich which was rather large and tasty. Both meals came with 2 choices of sides and there are 4 different sauces at the table as well.  The food was pretty good but seemed a bit average for Q. The brisket which was the real test for me and seemed dry and not very tender. I would have to guess it may have sat in the warmer a little too long. The Pulled Pork was really good and we saw several other people ordering the Bone in Chicken.  Overall they have pretty good food. Still looking for some real TX BBQ or something similar without all the sauces to cover up the flavor of the smoked meats. The meats should stand out on their own and not require much of anything. Maybe I'm just spoiled. Right across from the DV Airport. ROUND THEM UP!  3.75 STARS"}
{"text":"I have heard of BBQ places running out of meat, but not cole slaw. The slaw was gone about 1pm. Get there early folks for the slaw...lol. Well in this part of town, this joint seems to control the neighborhood - all of the business' use the place for catering orders and everybody else who doesn't want to eat fast food every day likely ends up here for lunch in this food graveyard part of town. Well, the place was mostly empty on our late lunch arrival except for the several flies that made their way inside the hangar like building to join us for lunch. My brisket was a tad overpriced at 10.50, but they did include two sides, but then again there was no option for anything else (like sandwich only, etc). The brisket was about average, but the young teenager serving the food was kind of a rookie in cutting and serving. If I want teenagers cutting and serving my meal, I will head to a fast food joint. The sides had some potential, but sweet potato fries were served without a dipping sauce and the mac and cheese was an unusual version that was lukewarm on arrival.       The small midwest monster needs a makeover as well. The kid shoves meat in a tiny 4oz plastic cup and pushes it down then it goes on the very small Hawaiian roll and that is 8 bucks (it was supposed to have cole slaw). Two of the sauces were good and those were the smoky sweet and traditional version.   OTHER ISSUES: they Have a door where employees come out and it enters right into the path of people carrying their food to the back room. Poor design as I nearly collided with the busboy as he darted through the door. Not a top 10 BBQ place in the valley, but the folks who live in this part of town will still be loyal until a better selection of food arrives in Deer valley."}
{"text":"My wife & I ordered take out tonight from here we both ordered the BBQ pork burrito with the cornbread as a side.   Upon opening the box the aroma of the BBQ pulled pork permeated the room right away. The burrito was very large with a tortilla that was bulging from the pulled pork inside.   As my wife & I took our first bites we both looked at each other acknowledging our approval of how delicious the burrito was.  My pulled pork was juicy, well seasoned, incredibly moist and tender with a whole lot of awesomeness. It had an amazing Smokey flavor and the extra side if BBQ sauce was really good. Both meals came with cornbread which was the perfect addition to the burrito.   FOOD: Great BBQ - Love the tangy/sweet sauce , The food is incredible. I really enjoyed my meal.  SERVICE:  The staff is always very pleasant. PRICE: The price is entirely on-point.  For the quality of food you receive, which is one of the best BBQ places I've tried in Phoenix. The food is worth every penny...and probably a little bit more.  I have never been disappointed here. CONCLUSION: One of the best BBQ places we have tried.  RETURN FACTOR 100%.         ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH"}
{"text":"Have been here several times and living in North Glendale, this has become my go to for good pulled pork sandwich.  Have been to Dillon's and Thee Pitt's on Bell Road and 55th \"ish\" and this place is better than both.  Only place I like better in the valley is Honey Bears but it is too far away from my home.  Though it looks good, skip the rocky road brownie.  Not as good as it looks."}
{"text":"So many BBQ spots opening up in the area it's almost hard to choose.  I got the sampler platter... My favorite part was the beef brisket. It was AMAZING!!! Everything else was just okay. I'd go here again but just order the brisket. I had to tell them to keep the fat on cuts of meat though.   The lunch line can get crowded but I think they just need a better way of taking orders.   The dining room set-up is a bit interesting as it looks like an old warehouse and its in the back of the space. I like that they are reusing the space without having t o do too much. I came back here twice in one month... that says a lot!"}
{"text":"Great catering....food and service outstanding. We will use them again"}
{"text":"I find it harder to come back each time I visit.  The quality of food has slowing gone downhill as operations grow.  Tried the Prime rib for the first time, it was way over cooked and very dry.  Frankly I would have been embarrassed serve it.  Wish the quality would return to way it was in the beginning."}
{"text":"Wohooooo!!! Just moved to Phoenix from LA and my company just got Pork On A Fork catered today!!!! Man best brisket ever..... Baked beans, corn bread, chicken all great flavors...  Thank you Pork on a Fork."}
{"text":"This place was incredibly tasty!!  Its a little pricey, but you get what you pay for!  The quality was A+!  Can't wait to eat here again!!"}
{"text":"highlights:  1. the meat was really well cooked. we had pulled pork and the brisket. both were tender. moist. smokey. (not a bbq salt lick) 2. the sides were great. the beans were flavorful. the rice was soft and the coleslaw was cold and not overly dressed.  3. the staff was awesome! we went in at 8:45 (they close at 9) and received friendly service and good attitudes.  4. THIS IS FAST FOOD AND FAST SERVICE! having a good quality bbq meal fast and delicious requires a good review.   would we go back? HECK YAH! it's the only close bbq joint in town that ACTUALLY tastes like great bbq."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town!!  I've had the chicken, pork, and brisket and all are super tender and moist.  You get your choice of sandwich, salad or burrito or bowls.  All are top quality as are the sides. The staff is very friendly and helpful. While super casual the dining area is super clean."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, not sure their claim of valley's best holds up though. Good if you're in the neighborhood but not really worth a special trip."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and there are a lot of choices and a menu that can be a bit I overwhelming in my opinion.  I had a brisket sandwhich with two sides and was stuffed. The main reason I did not give  it stars was due to the service. They were not rude nor were they friendly. We were clearly taking some trying to understand the menu as fisrt timers and they did not seem very thrilled about is doing so. The food was excellent though."}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich was awesome. Next time had the brisket and two meat sampler. Very good BBQ. Ubereats turned me on to this place."}
{"text":"There's something about the smell as you walk in the door.  Its the wonderful smell of the smoker.   This smell will haunt you all day.  Its soooo delicious.   This is about the only place I eat meat at, Pork On A Fork is a great little hidden place near just opposite Deer Valley Airport.  The food is fantastic, the meat is so tender, moist, not fatty and the smoked tasted is fantastic.    Their sauces really compliment the meats and sweet potato fries! I wonder if they will ever jar up the sauce... but i am sure it wouldn't be the same without the tender juicy smoked meats.     One of these days I would like to try the salmon, i am sure thats great.   HEY THEY HAVE LOOOOOOADS of seating space now!! plenty of room. Fast service, friendly staff GREAT FOOD!."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to be part of the Groupon deal (thanks Christina P.) and picked up a Premium Pork Package at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market on Sunday.  The $50 package includes 2 pkgs (4 chops @ 1 inch thick) of Pork Chops, 1 pkg of Ham Steaks (or sliced for sandwiches), 1 pkg of smoked pulled pork, 1 pkg of bacon (choice of Regular, Peppercorn or Cottage).  Seeing as how patience is a virtue that I do not have much of, that same afternoon, we made B.E.L.T.'s using the peppercorn bacon.  Wow-wee, was that peppery (i.e. not for the weaklings) but it sure was tasty!!   A few days later we had pulled pork sandwiches for dinner.  Just as easy as the guy made it sound; defrost, warm, serve.  Quick and delicious, perfect for a weeknight dinner.    Up next the ham and the pork chops.  I can't wait!  Next time, I'll have to try some of the bratwurst (flavors include original, jalapeno, pineapple, garlic, and tomato basil).  Or maybe the breakfast sausage . . .   Local products + fresh food = money well spent, even if it is a little more expensive.  In the end that makes me slow down and appreciate my food a little more, which is another good thing!   This is win-win-win-win situation!   Well, maybe not so much for the pig.  :-("}
{"text":"Yumm!! I was so excited to find this hidden gem. Really cool atmosphere. The food is delicious. It's set up kind of like Chipotle, so once you walk in the door you'll have food in your hands within minutes if not seconds. Their sauce selection is excellent and caters to all different taste pallets. Good pricing and great food! Will definitely go here on the regular. OH, and did I mention the great selection of local brews on tap!?"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic, great tasting barbecue, you've found it! The Midwest Monster is my personal favorite and the sides are made fresh and have fantastic flavors. Add more flavor with one of their delicious sauces and you're set! I like the Sweet and Mild sauce!!"}
{"text":"If there was a category of \"Where Not to Eat in Phoenix,\" this place is in the Top 5.  SAVE YOURSELF AND YOUR MONEY AND GO TO \"NAKED BBQ\"   Stayed away for over three years and thought I would roll the dice and try again. Wrong.  Terrible, there is no way on this planet anyone in their life their sane mind would say this place is any good.  Sauce sucks, meat sucks... No flavor, no body... Dry brisket... Lame sauce.  Messed up every single to go order. The guy opened every bag three times and still messed up everyone's. It would be faster to wait in line than order online. My coworkers say this happens every time.  This may seem like an petty but as a former customer service manager for a Fortune 50 company, this is the type of odd stuff that keeps people away......So a to go order get two sauce cups or you pay for additional..... Dine in and use all you want.  Makes me want to dine in and just pour bottle after bottle on my plate. They also should quadruple or more the exhaust and fresh air exchange so pe people don't smell like BBQ going back to the office, it's just a courtesy to your clients.  Save your money and go get a bunch of Dollar Menu items at McDonald's or go to Naked BBQ down the street or Little Miss BBQ down south.  Sorry no pics, the place isn't worth the effort."}
{"text":"So glad to see other great reviews for this place - we discovered this place because my husband's company used to get delivery from there - we have lived in the area for 5 years and never even knew it was there - in fact that is both it's biggest downfall and part of the draw for those \"in the know\".  If you didn't know it was there, you would probably never know - but once you go - you'll be SOOOOOO happy!  The staff is really friendly, the menu is easy to understand, the food is hot, fresh and oh so yummy.  The waffle fries are awesome!  So...  find it, try it, love it!"}
{"text":"Wow! Some of the best barbecue in the state!! The pulled pork and the BBQ Baked Beans are a must try!!!"}
{"text":"WOW are their drinks expensive!  Just got home from POAF and was surprised at the price of their drinks.  I ordered a large Midwest Monster and a drink.  The total with tax was $17.53 the Midwest Monster is $11.49, the tax should have been $1.39 which would put the drink at a WHOPPING $4.65.  Next time I think I will just get water which is free."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ!!!!   My favorite thing about this place is that it allows you to choose your meat (brisket, chicken, pork, sausage, etc) and then they have a variety of different sauces on the table to sample with the meats til you found out which one you like best!   They have several different combo options if you want a lot of different kinds of protein. They also offer sandwiches and bowls. The sides are really awesome as well. I got the waffles fries and charred corn and I'm excited to try more!  Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"WOW what an unexpected hidden pleasure in a Industrial complex.  Good BBQ, good service, good location and when you put it all together you get great.  Kodda helped us with suggestions and he was right on, the sampler was the best. We had never enjoyed good chicken at a BBQ place till now, brisket so tender you could cut it with a spoon and melt in your mouth.  Shout out to Paige the Manager she knows what she is doing. Excellent choice of sauces, reasonable prices all this makes you want to leave a great tip.  Keep up the good work!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is homestyle and delicious.  They are wise and do few things and do those few things well.  The environment is laid back,  open and comfortable. A great place for kids."}
{"text":"Smokin! Thats how I'd describe this place. The food is smokin' good...and it also is smokey inside. I left smelling like I was preparing the meat myself.  Because of that, and the fact that the sauce selection's \"Hot\" was more like \"mild\" can I only give the place four stars.   After reading some reviews and blog posts about the place...and learning it was just down the road..I had to try them out. I suggested going there with a PR colleague of mine for a lunch meeting. Luckily, there was a place to sit. If this place gets super busy, you probably will have to stand or take your food to go. I think there were only six 4-tops of tables in the place.  Pork on a Fork is in a business complex and not easy to find from Deer Valley Rd. Drive slowly as you go down the road and hopefully they'll have a little sign out to designate where to turn in or you'll probably miss it. The food is GOOD! I ordered the brisket sandwich with sweet potato fries and potato salad. Our food came out in a few minutes and was really good. The brisket was in big chunks...it had some burnt areas around the fat, which was fine with me. It was a nice helping of brisket on the bun, and some fell out as I ate it.  The sauces, which I mentioned above are not that exciting. The \"hot\" sauce wasn't spicy...I have sinus issues right now and the sauce didn't clear them at all.  The sweet potato fries were hot and crispy and just a light salt on them. The potato salad was your typical mayo-based potato salad with big celery pieces in it. Creamy and yummy.  The staff was friendly and nice. One of the workers saw us as we were disposing of our trash and asked if we liked our food. They also offer breakfast...no dinner yet. I'll be back. For sure. Just maybe before I shower for the day."}
{"text":"Went here this week with my coworkers who chose to have lunch here. I was excited about going here because I love BBQ. When we first got here, it was probably about 1145 or so, and the line was pretty long. They only have one cashier who takes your order, and that  coupled with the long line made even getting my order in take pretty darn long. The food itself? I had the baby back ribs and mac salad and potato salad. My thoughts? Meh. The salads were just mediocre and the ribs only a step above the kind you can buy in the package at costco and heat up. Dissappointing to spend $22 and get that, and the servings of the salads were also fairly small. The worst part though? The flies in the dining area. I was constantly having to waive away flies! Unacceptable! I mean maybe it was because of it being the rush hour with people constantly opening the doors but man, it wasnt like I was eating outside, I was eating INSIDE. So in summary, the food was just average, the portions of the sides small, the cost high, and the dining experience, terrible. I  would give it 0 stars if I could. Hopefully they will get these issues addressed.  Not sure how this place can average 4.5 stars,. My visit was just awful."}
{"text":"I am eating this fab BBQ right now!! My husband works near them but didn't even know until a client took him out to lunch. He was so impressed that he went back after work to get us both dinner!! Great ribs, smoke ring, tender but not falling apart... great slaw and tater salad as good as mine!! Wow... what a find. My ex was a competition BBQ man and until today, nothing could beat his ribs...now, I have had better...wonderful stuff.  Chef Jill Ames Miranda, Ames to Please Catering"}
{"text":"Not the best in any town. Went for dinner and everything was in foil on warmers. Will not return."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had a Groupon for here that we used several months ago. We went for a late lunch/early dinner on a Saturday.  Location: A bit out of the way and in an odd strip next to the Deer Valley Airport. Inside was a bit small and noisy. Location and bathrooms were clean.  Food: I had the pulled pork, brisket, and smoked sausage with coleslaw and bbq beans. The pulled pork was pretty good. Decent balance of flavor from the meat, seasoning, and smoke. The brisket is the best I've had outside of Texas. It was a bit dry but had a nice crust, a good smoky flavor, and went well with the sauces. I regretted making the sausage part of my sampler, as I felt I was gypped because there wasn't much of it. It was pretty standard restaurant sausage: better than what you buy at the grocery store but I've had better. The coleslaw was okay. The bbq beans seemed like they were canned beans that had been dressed up a bit but still tasted like they needed something added. With the addition of my favorite of their sauces to the mix, I thought the beans were pretty good. I can't recall much about their variety of sauces anymore but do recall my gf and I had a couple we both liked.  My girlfriend had the pulled pork, ribs, and chicken thigh with mac n' cheese and cornbread. She thought the pulled pork and ribs were pretty good. I ended up eating her chicken thigh because she was full and felt it was too smokey. I was actually pretty impressed with it. It wasn't dried out like a lot of smoked chicken and, while the smoke was the predominant flavor, I felt it suited the meat well. She really enjoyed her mac n' cheese and cornbread.  Staff: Friendly and helpful.   Summary: So far, this is my favorite barbecue place in the Phoenix-area. I haven't been back yet, but I do plan on going again in the near future and I always recommend it whenever anybody inquires about a good barbecue place in the valley."}
{"text":"This place is bomb.com. I even got my food to go and it was still poppin. I got the Mac n cheese and it had some type of Cajun seasoning, it tasted delicious. I even had sweet potato fries to go and they were not soggy when I got home. The fries with sweet and salty and a tad crispy. I got the BBQ chicken sandwich and it was also delicious. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"This place is great, just not as consistent in their delivery as some of the other BBQ places in the area. They were the first to bring BBQ to Deer Valley so I have to give them props for that."}
{"text":"Metaphorical back to back to back orgasms in my mouth every time. I literally cry when my food is brought out. Mac and cheese is bomb. Sweet potato fries with honey mustard is fire"}
{"text":"Had never heard of this place before today. But I won't soon forget! A rep took me here for lunch today. It was truly amazing. Then eat was so tender. Delicious! I had the 3 meat deluxe and while I appreciate her using her hands to pull apart the meats rolling it between her fingers, it was bothersome to me. A bit barbaric at first. But omg it was so good. Love that they weigh the meat. The place is so unique. Smart and niche. I love this place. Can't wait to take my carnivore 15 year old son! Wait I can't wait to go again too!"}
{"text":"Really good pulled pork and chicken! I mean really good!!! Solid potato salad and tasty waffle fries. I tried the burrito today which disappointed as they use baked beans in it, which was kinda weird and standard store bought tortillas. I would suggest that they use super large premium local made tortillas and also include quesadillas on the menu. If you stick with the pulled pork sandwich...you will not be disappointed. This is really close to work and I will come back a few times a month."}
{"text":"Yum-E, Great BBQ Joint.. Went today to the restaurant for lunch. I had purchased a Groupon for a discount and thought it sounded to good to pass up.  The restaurant is kinda hidden in a business building area, but just look for the signs near the road it's not terribly hard to find.  Hours are limited Mon-Fri closing at 3pm so unfortunately you can't stop by for dinner.      I walked into the place and it was filled with the sweet smells of smoking meat.  With my mouth watering  I ordered the smokin' deal.  It had a smoked sausage, a pulled pork sandwich, and a brisket cut on a bun, which came with two sides.  For $10 bucks for lunch not a bad deal for all that.  The food came out pretty fast and while I was waiting bumped into a fellow yelper who was proud of this restaurant find.  Myself I couldn't wait to dig in.  It was very tender and fresh tasting.  I'm very glad this place isn't very far from my home, but I must find out where these farmer markets they go to on the weekend are. A+ place"}
{"text":"After many years of searching the Peoria Glendale area....we have found our place. Our high bar is Dreamland Ribs in Tuscaloosa Alabama....so we feel pretty confident we can identify good BBQ  Meat was stellar. We had the brisket and the pulled P. the 4 sauces offer anyone something from super sweet to tangy.  Atmosphere was good.....cool little back room with a few plasmas. This place gives you what you need, good BBQ. Not heavy on the frills which is fine with me to keep the prices down. It has a very southern/Midwestern  feel and evidently the guy is a Husker fan. College football fans are almost always GREAT people  ;)  Friendly service. Price was reasonable for a family of 5 and a 1/2 lbs. of brisket.  Baked beans were a little weird tasting. Slaw is good with.   mac and cheese was actually not that big of a hit with the kids. Wife liked it.   This is a MUST go to if you like BBQ...... After our last run to fmsDvs.....and a sandwich that was half fat....we were at a loss.   Go...."}
{"text":"Best brisket! Smoked chicken and pulled pork were delicious as well. Good sides and a decent price for BBQ - which can actually get kinda expensive. Atmosphere was kinda meh - I would definitely recommend grabbing and going."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service. I rarely get out to this area so luckily I was able to get in minutes before they closed.  I ordered the sampler but with brisket and extra pulled pork instead.  Half an hour later I get home and find that half of the portions was pure fat.  I guess I got the dregs of the day.  The parts I did get were amazing, just wished I had more meat than fat.  If I were eating in I could have said something but I guess the moral of the story is don't go in moments before closing.  I've eaten BBQ at various small operations around the country and they do have some very good stuff so I give them props for having some great BBQ."}
{"text":"Very disappointed which I guess isn't the norm here but my meal was not very good. Maybe they had a bad day but not a good experience despite everyone recommending this place.  I ordered the sampler platter, hot link sausage, pulled pork, chicken, and added 4 baby backs.   Chicken-Excellent Cole Slaw-Good but nothing special Waffle Fries-Seasoned so not very good Sauces-The Mustard was the best and very favorable, the others aren't bad but nothing special. Ribs-Major disappointment, they were over cooked, very dry, and nowhere near \"Fall of the Bone\".  Hot Link-The was good and it's about third of a hot dog size wise. Pulled Pork-portion was big but also very dry. Corn Bread-Did not eat because a fly landed on it twice. Price-pretty overpriced too  Unfortunately I won't be back on my next trip to the area and drove down from my hotel in Anthem."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Very clean! Very knowledgeable staff, locally owned . The food is fresh fast and huge portions . Really great flavor foods. Brisket sandwich is awesome!! Barbecue at its finest. This place is addicting."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in Phoenix! My family and I loved the food, we were all so full and happy with delicious meats. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"This is twice  we've used this location with the same result.   I have no problem charging and taking the order over the phone. When we go to pick it up, huge problem.  They can't find the order... Have no idea what we're talking about... Even though I can show them the charge on the bank app  from the day we place the order, this still does not get the order moving any quicker.   20 minutes of wasted time before they finally find it in  some archived system,  even though the order is only two days old.   The food is ok, but seriously I just can't recommend these guys"}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place after watching it on Diners Drive ins and Dives with Guy Fieri. Upon arriving the place was empty even though we stopped by a hour before they closed or the foods sells out, that's what the sign said. We got the Sampler plate with  four Meats( Pulled Pork,Chicken,Beef, Sausage) and you can add Baby Back Ribs to your order. Our sides Mac n Cheese Potatoe Salad and Baked Beans. All the meats were dry, the ribs were tuff, to tuff to finish, It didn't taste like they were cooked long enough and the Mac n Cheese was old, the other sides were ok. Customer service was fine. We had high hopes for this place, we left disappointed."}
{"text":"Holy crap this is some good BBQ.    My wife and I love BBQ and are always looking to try new places.  When we saw this place was just down the street from us we decided to give it a try.  My wife and I both got the smokin' meal, which comes with brisket, pulled pork, sausage and two sides.  The meats were each equally fantastic and the BBQ sauce was really, really good.  I also really enjoyed the baked beans and cornbread I got with my meal.    The price was pretty reasonable and we got our food super quick.  The place is located in kind of a weird place but it's worth looking for if you have to.  Seriously, some of the best BBQ in town."}
{"text":"Someone else used the words \"salt bomb\" in their review - that sums it up perfectly!  I was in on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. I wanted to get a feel for the offerings, so I decided to order the two meat and two sides platter. I requested pork and brisket (they were out of pork, so I switched to chicken) as the meats, and the potato salad and beans for the sides. The employees behind the counter were great. Friendly, able to answer questions, and in good moods. The place is kept clean, and given the \"off\" time I visited, plenty of table space to choose from. The meats are served without sauce - and there are four sauces on the table to choose from. (Mild, sweet, mustard based, and hot.) The potato salad was nice. Maybe a little heavy on the red onion - but I happen to like onion, so I didn't mind. The beans were bland, and somehow, the pork in the beans was completely dry and tough. I can't figure out how that's possible - as there's so much liquid in the beans - any meat in there should positively be tender. Then comes the salt bomb! The chicken was so salty, I could barely taste any of the sauces other than the hot, which tasted like a BBQ salt lick. Tasting it without the sauce, I could barely discern any chicken OR smoke, only salt. The brisket (also seen in another review) was almost like a beef jerky. It was so dry and tough - and when tasting without the sauce - I could taste the meat and smoke - but mostly - no surprise here - salt! In the time it took me to eat the potato salad, half the beans and half the meat, I went through three cups of iced tea, and filled my cup a fourth time on my way out - and was still thirsty). I ended up throwing away over half the meat and leaving still hungry - I just can't handle all that salt. There are several options for decent BBQ in the area - I won't be coming back here at all."}
{"text":"We came with high expectations because of the Yelp reviews but I must say that we were pretty disappointed. The place was not very clean at all. 80% of the tables were dirty, the restrooms weren't kept up, the overflow compartment at the bottom of the soda machine was completely clogged and dripping water on the floor. There were no clean cups so we had to get our drinks in to-go cups.  I ordered the sampler and added brisket. The pork and chicken had a great smoke ring appearance but not flavorful at all and the brisket was really dry. I chose bbq rice and Mac and cheese as my sides. The bbq rice had absolutely no flavor other than being spicy but the Mac and cheese was really good. I really wanted to like this place and always want to support independent restaurants because I know how tough owning a restaurant is and how hard the owners probably work but it just wasn't as good as I'd hoped."}
{"text":"We had brisket with no bun. Brisket was excellent and could be cut with fork. No knife necessary. Sides were good and BBQ sauce was good. Fun industrial feel. They do have a good selection of bottled beer. Tvs in dining area and kid friendly"}
{"text":"I've been here three times and have had terrific food each time.  The meat is incredible and their sauces are amazing.  Portion sizes are generous and the mac & cheese is delicious!  This is what BBQ is all about, definitely one of the best in Phoenix and we're lucky to have it here in the NW valley!"}
{"text":"Great food, great access and great people. Thrilled to have a BBQ place this good in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Spent 120.00 on a huge feast to go. Picked up order and requested all of the sauces to be included. We  didn't get one. By the time we got the food and realized we didn't have any sauce we were annoyed and no one wanted to drive back. Meat was ok, probably would have been good with sauce. What a waste of 120.00."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, please dont go here when you're starving because the smell when you walk into order will cause you to order everything on the menu. I ordered the deluxe bbq sampler with sausage sub'd for the chicken. I chose the coleslaw, mac and cheese, and an added cornbread muffin for my sides. All of the sides looked very good and this was a hard choice to make. Driving home was torture and it took all of will power to not dive into it one-handed and cause a wreck on the 17. The pulled pork was great! Very moist and flavorful. The sausage was a letdown as it wasn't spicy at all and tasted like a plain johnsonville sausage. The brisket was moist and very smokey. In fact the smoke flavor was all I could taste.  As for the sides, the cornbread was by far the best of the 3 I bought. It was sweet and light. A bit crumbly but in a good way. I loved this muffin. I'm not ashamed to say that I scraped the wrapper to get every bit of it that I could. The coleslaw really lets the cabbage be in the spotlight. The sauce is slightly sweet and is inly barely coated on the cabbage. It disappointed me at first but was actually a nice break from the otherwise heavy meal. The mac and cheese was also good. Very cheesy with the main cheese being cheddar. They add a spice mix to the top that added a smokey/salty touch. I'd probably eat here again as there aren't very many bbq places to choose from in the north valley. The pulled pork will probably be my go to. I wonder if they'll serve it to me on cornbread muffins????"}
{"text":"We used them for catering for a party at our house and everything was amazing and got rave reviews from our guests !"}
{"text":"This place is very good. The pork ribs were not fall off the bone, but they were very flavorful.   The brisket is juicy and flavorful. make sure you get it fresh cut from their smoker, the meat out of the single portion trays where they plate the combinations was pretty dry."}
{"text":"Good call Yelpers, good call.  Full disclosure, I've had barbecue at some pretty famous establishments in Austin and Kansas City.  While this place doesn't have the history or the reputation of some of barbecue bastions of the world, this is definitely among the best barbecue joints I've been to in the valley.  Perhaps that might not be a high bar to clear, but its definitely worth a try.  As with so many barbecue joints I've been to, this location seems to have a goofy disposition.  This particular establishment is located in a row of storage warehouses right across the street from Deer Valley Airport.  You really have to be looking for this place as the exterior blends in with all the other businesses in the complex.  Once inside though, the story changes entirely.  I was warmly greeted by a gal at the register as the lunch crowd came streaming in.  Their meat smoker is right behind the register filled with slabs of brisket, ribs, pork, and sausages.  The smell wafting into the front counter is heavenly.  Theres a tiny amount of seating up front, but there's a bunch more around the corner in back.  The back is basically an industrial garage thats been turned into a sports lounge of sorts with multiple TVs showing ESPN channels, a bunch of booths as well as table seating in the middle.  Not fancy or pretentious at all, but very relaxed.  If it had a bar, it'd be perfect.  Being that this was my first trip, I grab a sampler plate.  You get pulled pork, smoked chicken, and smoked sausage along with two sides.  For a little extra you can substitute a meat for brisket.  Being that brisket is their calling card, I exchanged brisket for chicken this time.  I got BBQ beans and waffle fries as my sides.  And got a couple of soft rolls to make sandwiches with my meats.  I grabbed a booth seat in back since the front was already getting crowded.  So let's get to the verdicts on their food.  And for the record, I typically like to eat my BBQ without sauce as the best barbecue doesn't need it.  For starters, excellent brisket.  Nice smokey flavor with a pronounced smoke ring to match, tender and juicy, and a nice portion.  The sausage's smokey flavor was a little less pronounced, but plenty juicy and flavorful as well.  The pulled pork was also good, though perhaps a little on the dry side.  The beans were a little bit of a bust as I didn't taste any BBQ flavor in those.  I actually got the waffle fries so I could try their four sauces which are provided at the table.  Of the four, I actually like their mustard flavored sauce best.  The mustard gives it a little tangy zip that adds to the flavor without being too spicy.  They also have a sweet & mild sauce, a smoked tangy sauce, and a hot & spicy sauce (it wasn't all that hot in my opinion).  I applied a little of the mustard sauce to the meat which was great, though as I said great smoked BBQ doesn't need sauce.  Total for the sampler plate (including the brisket substitute and two sides), 2 rolls, and fountain drink was $15.  Good lunch portions that left me satisfied without feeling uncomfortably full.  I was in and out in less than 30 minutes.  The place was really getting busy as I left so the average time spent here might be a little longer than that.    After eating here I still give a slight edge to Bobby Q's as the best in the valley, but POAF can certainly hold their own, especially on the brisket.  In the end, its not Bryant's, or Franklin's, or Salt Lick.  But if the Phoenix area is going to get into the barbecue sweepstakes going forward, it will be competition style BBQ joints like Pork On A Fork that will be forging that path."}
{"text":"Normally Pork on a Fork is my go to for lunch and tonight I decided to get it for take out for dinner for me and my husband. I regret this decision as this is by far one of the worst meals I have ever had.   For $30, I got a Beef Briskit meal and a Briskit BBQ bowl. They gave about half of the portions of both meat and sides then they do during Lunch hours, which is a mixed blessing as the flavor was severely lacking. My BBQ bowl was more than 50% potato salad. This normally would not be a big deal as I usually love POAF's potato salad, but tonight it was a gloopy, watery, odd tasting mess. It is pretty gross and I tried separating out as much edible food as I could. My husband took one bite of his potato salad and scraped the rest into the garbage.   The meat in my husband's meal was very fatty. He did like the flavor, and was satisfied with the cornbread muffin, paltry as it was. Most of what I brought home ended up being thrown away. If I lived closer I would have taken it back. Instead this was a very expensive lesson: avoid Pork on a Fork after 2pm."}
{"text":"Boy - used to love PoaF...but since they've expanded their operations, it's just not the same. The smoker isn't sitting right behind the servers any more (I think I missed the smell right off the bat).  The Po Boy sandwich isn't on the menu anymore (though they made up something close to it when I asked - close, but not the way it was).  Just seems a lot more like the other BBQ joints now.  :-("}
{"text":"I got a BBQ bowl. You choice of filing. Rice beans or Mac and cheese. Your choice of meat and your choice of toppings. I did cilantro rice, brisket, Cole slaw, and corn. The brisket had good flavor but on the drier side. Overall okay if your in north Phoenix and want some BBQ. A little pricey.  For a 24 oz drink and the BBQ now the total was 17 bucks.  The guys behind the counter were slow. The contents of the bowl were not consistent with two other people who were in my party."}
{"text":"The pulled pork was absolutely fantastic. The only downside is seating is very limited so be prepared that you may need take-out but the food is fantastic"}
{"text":"Let me add to the 5 star reviews here!  My husband and I got the sampler plates and oh man....we are so glad we found this place. Best BBQ ever. Brisket was tender & flavorful, pulled pork was juicy and tender and smokey, sausage was perfect, sauces were amazing....  The sides were all great (get the beans!)"}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place, I've been back twice now.  Great barbecue and a ton of seating in the rear"}
{"text":"We got the family feast for 5 its nicely portioned it could even feed maybe 6 depending on how hungry your group is. I am bummed out that they didn't have any cornbread left when i visited, however i will be back soon.  The employees are very friendly and they keep the establishment clean."}
{"text":"The BBQ is incredible but I personally fid it a bit overpriced.  Even so I would go more often but the deal killer for me is the drinks.  Coke vs Pepsi - i don't care, but these guys are serving RC cola.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time this year.  Had the bbq pork sandwich with waffle fries and potato salad. My sis had the Midwest monster with Cole slaw and mac and cheese. The pork was good and the sides were generously portioned. The place was super busy even for a lunch on a Sunday. It's nice you have many sauces to chose from. The RC cola was a cool soda option.  Would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Been twice. Probably the best BBQ in North Phoenix.  I like the following things in BBQ. #1) Smokey flavor - I want to know it spent lots of time in smoke. #2) Moist #3) Great sauce Ordered the side of two ribs and a pulled pork sandwich. Fail on #1 for both. Smoke flavor was not what I consider smokey.  They nailed #2 and #3. Little lacking in the smokey flavor for my taste, but it is what I expect when I go out for BBQ, Beans with the burnt ends are pretty darn good. Potato salad was good. Sweet potato fries and waffle fries are good.  Staff is friendly and the place is kept very clean.  I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"I normally get the pulled pork and that is absolutely delicious I also recommend the macaroni salad that is very good. This is a great every day barbecue place"}
{"text":"Ok first you will pass it at least once, don't give up it is worth it. I saw this place on food network and was like hmmmm let me give it a go... Glad I did! Are you tired of the same old BBQ place, you know the ones don't smell of smoke and the stainless steel is way too clean, and when you taste it the food yep tastes like it was oven cooked! I know, I know we have a few good places but most are not on the north side of town. Well this place smells like the BBQ pits of NC, you know the ones that have wood outback and you walk in and can taste the Que before you taste the meal. Not saying this is NC style but that is where this transports me.  So let's talk staff since they are the heart and soul.. and let me tell you, for the most part these are young folks and maybe first or second job, but they care about this place! They walk you through everything and will make sure they make the best deal for you. You want the fatty piece of brisket you got it, you want the darker piece of sausage you got.   Now the food!! If you get nothing else or you are looking for your last meal get the brisket. It is the best I have and I have it just about everywhere they are known for it. Maybe you don't like brisket, fore shame, but they have you covered with pulled pork, some of the best pulled chicken and smoked sausage. They have great beans, Mac and cheese and corn bread. All around it is top notch.  We order for all adults a family of 6 and we spend less than we do at any fast food and we are full.   Have them cater your next event I am sure you won't be disappointed!!   This is the longest post I have ever written but that is how impressed I am with this place."}
{"text":"It's 1030am right now and I'm drooling for some Pork on a Fork as I write this.  Walk into the restaurant and you are assaulted with the smell of bbq, and like Pavlov's dogs... IMMEDIATELY start drooling.  I just couldn't help but be shocked at how good this place smelled.  I am one of those customers that is led by her nose and these guys had me at hello.  A coworker and I went for lunch during the week... walked in around 1130ish and it was pretty empty for the moment, but there are only five tables in there.  Those tables filled up while we were there.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich... and fell in love.  I swear, I went to this place on Friday, and it's now Sunday... and I'm considering going back already.  The meat just fell apart.  The pork was so moist and juicy... toss some of the sweet bbq on top and BLAM! You have yourself an excellent lunch. (possibly dinner too, depending on how big your stomach is)  It came with two sides... I got the bbq beans and the sweet potato fries.  The beans are just as high quality as the pork!  They have bits of meat in them...   Hold on... I need a napkin to wipe my mouth as I write this....   *wipe* Ok.  We're good.  Anyway.  The sweet potato fries are thick and moist as well... very sweet, which is excellent.  My coworker had the beef brisket, which was drier, but that's to be expected with brisket.  It was definitely tasty tho.  So I guess these guys are at some farmers markets and stuff... I would check out their website and see if they are anywhere near you, since they are in the north valley.  But you GOTTA try this stuff.  It's off the hook! (pun intended... Guy Fieri has visited here)"}
{"text":"I'm from Kansas City and I can tell you this is the best BBQ in town hands down. I've tried just about every BBQ place in the valley the last 10 years that I've lived here and nothing comes close. There beans, bbq sauce and meats are all top notch, but their pulled pork stands out above them all!"}
{"text":"An edit from my previous review. This place was probably in the midst of some growing pains where their food quality suffered. But they have made a great turn around since and this is back to being one of the top bbq hole in the walls in north phoenix"}
{"text":"The Short: A restaurant that boasts having 'The Valley's best BBQ' but only serves up an uninspired, 'meh.'  The Pros: - It tastes ...... alright. - The back room dining area is clean, comfy, and features three large-screen TVs.  - Orders are brought out pretty fast.  The Cons: - Brisket is as dry as the Phoenix desert.  - No real smoke flavor or spices. - Customer service is often dismal. - Sides don't complement main dishes.  - Majority of meats have a bland mass-produced flavor.   The Best Item(s):  - Coca-cola  - Interesting Fact: BBQs used to be the politician's venue of choice to speak with their constituents. Back in the day, talking with your senator was always accompanied with free food! (Source: BBQ: The History of an American Institution, Robert F. Moss)  _____________________________________________________________  The Story:  I consider myself a BBQ aficionado. I've feasted at several of America's most cherished BBQ Pits from coast to coast and roast to roast. Congress has passed legislation that requires BBQ festival patrons to address me as 'your majesty.' Cows and pigs are afraid to make eye contact with me!  So believe me when I tell you, I know the difference between a good and bad brisket.   Because of such, I take it serious when a restaurant claims to have the best BBQ of a particular locale. Unfortunately, more times than not, these claims are a mix of bravado and marketing. Pork on a Fork happens to be an quintessential example of this phenomenon.   I've been to this outer-beltway Deer Valley location twice and both times ultimately led to me feeling like Mick Jagger (cause I can't get not satisfaction).   The customer service was not just disengaged with the task at hand, but seemed to have no interest in the customer being there at all. I have tried their pork, brisket, and ribs. All three had the same mass-produced bland flavor that was more reminiscent of fast food than it was masterful BBQ. The brisket was the worst offender, possiblely due to the entire top fat cut off before smoking. The end result, regardless of the reason, was a BBQ sandwich that had the same succulence as a bucket of sand. There are bags of charcoal scattered throughout the restaurant, and I'm sure they're actually used, but a disconnect exists somewhere because it's almost impossible to make anything with such promising beginnings this insipid.  Pork on a Fork has great reviews overall. I find this mind boggling based on my experience but sometimes that's just how it goes. There's always the possibility they were having a bad day during my visits. Cooking is more of an art than a science.  If you're looking for some quick and easy BBQ, stop by. Otherwise it's probably best to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I believe many of the folks doing reviews on here need to take a trip to Texas to try real barbecue. Their portions are also small here for what you pay."}
{"text":"My advice is to go online and sign up for their reward program (rewardmebaby.com/porkonafork) before you go in to eat, because you will be back!  We went today at an off hour, so there was no waiting. We both sampled the brisket and loved it so that's what we ordered. The meat is hand sliced and weighed right in front of you and it's very moist and tender. For sides I had the mac and cheese and waffle fries and my husband had cole slaw and something else. The mac and cheese was worth ordering again and the fries were good for holding the sauce. There are 3 sauces on the table and the sweet and smoky one was my favorite - i'm a big fan of smoke. Everyone working today was friendly and seemed happy to be there."}
{"text":"Pork on a Fork is easily the best BBQ you can get in the northwest valley. The restaurant is in an unassuming building but the scent of smoked meats lets you know you are in the right place. When you walk in you are met with the meat counter and the easy to read menu board. I would highly recommend getting a sampler which has 3 meats and 2 sides so you can get a good taste of everything the place has to offer. This time around I got the one that features pulled chicken, pulled pork, and a half sausage link. The chicken is by far the best bbq chicken I have ever had and the zippy mustard glaze is the perfect complement to it. The mac and cheese is my favorite side. They top it with some kind of house seasoning that takes it over the top. My meal was just a shade under $12 and will kept me fed all day long."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, it's time once again to drop my rating of what used to be one of my favourite restaurants. If this happened at any other place I'd give it a 1 star and permanently avoid on principle, but because PoaF have pretty much the best barbecue I've ever tasted it'll get a flat 3, accompanied by a giant frown of annoyance.  So what happened? Did the prices increase like they did at Loving Hut? No. Food quality dropped? No. Still cramped as a sardine tin inside with less than a snowball's chance in hell of getting a seat at lunchtime? Well, yes, but that isn't the reason. This time it's due to false advertising. Several weeks ago they came up with the idea of a loyalty card. Buy 5 meals, the sixth is free. Here's my photo of it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/825nC-s-cQG6Hsul5Gm2cA?select=sSvKMJtwYvgp3PuNafyBsA). Seems pretty obvious how it works, right? Well, last time I was there I reached the free meal marker. I usually get their \"Smokin' Meal\" menu item - two types of meat, plus two sides and half a sausage. However when I tried to claim the free meal the counter girl informed me that they don't give that particular meal out as free because, quote unquote, \"there's so much meat in it\". Which equates to about two fistfuls of meat, half a sausage like I said, plus maybe eight ounces in canned baked beans and sweet potato fries. She then tells me that I can get any of the other items on the menu for free, or else she could give me a free drink OR, \"say.. three dollars discount\". The card didn't say \"excludes Smokin' Meal\". They brought me there six times and told me the card was frickin next to worthless. Get another menu item for $7 for free, or get $3 off my smokin' meal which is only a couple of bucks more than the items they classify as free? Wow.  I'd have been happy to show up here forever and pay their asking price for a meal. But the fact that they pushed off a loyalty card on me then told me to GFY when I tried to claim on it is rank as hell. Fail, lose two stars, Seacrest out. Oh, Seacrest back in for another ten seconds. Went there today, bought the usual, girl didn't offer me another card or mention the concept at all, left. Still delicious; still pissed at them. Seacrest out again."}
{"text":"I'd seen Pork on a Fork pop up on check-in's for some time now and had been meaning to check it out since I work fairly close by.  The first time I went I had trouble finding the place (even with the warning that it is tucked away).  Heck I came back a week later and had trouble finding it again!  3rd time might be the charm...  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich seeing as that was what was raved about in most reviews (and coming from the name of the restaurant).  The pork was juicy, and the tangy bbq sauce complimented it well.  For sides I got the sweet potato fries and cornbread muffin.  The fries were great, but the muffin was small and tasted more like a vanilla cupcake with a hint of corn.  Next time I swapped the muffin out for the mac n cheese (on recommendation) and wasn't disappointed.  The total for a meal came out to around $10, but you definitely get your money's worth.  After eating here for lunch, eating dinner didn't really seem necessary either time.  In addition to the food sticking with you, I noticed the smell of bbq was ingrained in my clothing for the remainder of the day.  That may come from sitting in the primary seating area that is right by the cookers, maybe sitting in the \"overflow\" area would prevent that.  Either way, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy.  I stopped in here on my way from Los Angeles to Sedona.  The restaurant is in a small office park near an airport.    -Ordered a mixed sampler plate for about $11.  -pulled pork and brisket were both very good.  As others have noted, they don't put a bunch of sauce on the meat allowing one to really taste the smoky flavor (rather than a sauce).   They do have a nice selection of sauces on the side that you can add yourself. -the meat quality seemed very good. -sweet potato fries are a winner. -checked in on yelp for a free drink.   All in all.. a nice place to stop for lunch.  I'd come back."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Moderate line. Staff was friendly and helpful.  Ordered the brisket bowl. Just the right amount of meat. Tender and fall apart. Mac and cheese was delicious. Only issue was it was lukewarm.  Would prefer a tad hotter. Wife had the pork bowl with Mac and cheese and cole slaw. Luckily there was bbq sauce, because the pork was dry.  Not sure if it's the best in the valley, but worth a try."}
{"text":"Brisket and chicken on point. Loved the Mac n cheese too and spicy sauce. Bbq beans were too sweet for my liking and the waffle fries were too heavy like they had breading. I'd love to see a little spice in the beans. Awesome spot - love the chipotle style setup and quick check out."}
{"text":"Stopped by after an appointment in the Northern part of Phoenix. When I first walked in I wasn't sure if it was take out only or more of a butcher place. After reading the sign and peering around the corner to see seating is in back, I decided to order.   The young man serving was very friendly. He suggested the combo so I could try several different items. He also recommended the baked beans and Mac n cheese. His recommendation was spot on. I'm not a huge Mac n cheese fan, but loved theirs - good cheese flavor. Beans were good too.   The combo comes with pork, sausage and chicken. Enjoyed all of them and was thrilled they had watermelon tea. It's rare to find but I love it. There's not a lot of ambiance but the people are friendly and the food is tasty."}
{"text":"The meats are always taste really good and their sauces are exceptional. However the meats always tend to taste a bit dry and almost NEED the sauce... the best BBQ I've ever had was from MA and you had to wait almost an hour for your order. I think the problem here is their Chiptole style setup where they allow the meats to air dry..."}
{"text":"I've been craving BBQ for a very long time, saw the awesome reviews & made the drive over here.  Simple menu which I love, helps me narrow my decision down faster ;) I got the chicken sandwich with waffle fries & cornbread, hubby got pulled pork sandwich with waffle fries & macaroni salad.  These are definitely the kind of sandwiches you don't even need sauce on! So flavorful & tender.  Fries were fresh & very crispy but my cornbread was way too sweet, it was almost like dessert to me, eh no biggie.  We will definitely be coming back here soon to try some other meats!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. It just wasn't HOT enough. This never sits right with me. I also waited 10 minutes looking for help for someone to come from the back to give me a take out box. I was the only customer in store at the time, but they were inattentive. The peach cobbler was NOT good. No real crust, just dry crumble and it was like gelatin thickened peach filling. No thanks. You shouldn't offer subpar desserts. It's better to have none at all. Not in a rush to return."}
{"text":"Too Bad I can only choose a 5 Star!  This place Rocks the Great AMERICAN SPIRIT.. I ordered the Pulled Pork meal and my tummy loved it.  The staff is friendly and they have a cool place out back to eat at with music and TV'S.  I will be back for sure. I noticed other great foods available that I will explore soon enough.   I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great quality meat."}
{"text":"Not too bad, sort of like a Chipotle but for BBQ, food is very good, service was a tad slow, prices are a tad high. Had the Salad with chicken on top, pretty good but they didn't seem to know what to put on it besides lettuce and chicken. Soft drink prices are insane, $2.25 and RC, no pepsi, no coke, I'll pass, at least they gave me a full size cup for water. Atmosphere is decent . I'll be back...4 stars."}
{"text":"Came here to test out for work as a potential catering option. Had such high hopes, maybe it was a fluke. Co-worker had told me how delicious, moist & tasty the food was when he had it at a wedding-sadly I was let down. Ordered the BBQ Sampler-Deluxe (pulled chicken, pulled pork & brisket). The pulled chicken was dark meat & very tasty to my surprise. The brisket & pulled pork both was dry & bland. With all the meat a dinner roll would have been nice, but no. Baked beans were yummy & peppery. Mac&Cheese was a bit grainy. Workers were really nice, but a bit slow for the lunch time crowd."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best BBQ places I've eaten at in AZ. Every single one of their meats is money. Used to go for the Midwest Monster (pulled pork, brisket, pepper jack cheese, coleslaw, and crazy js spicy BBQ sauce, delicious) Recently I've changed and started getting their sampler platter. It comes with pulled pork, roasted chicken, and sausage, with 2 sides(for 1.49 you can sub brisket for one of the meats, which I always sub for sausage) and then ask them for some slider rolls to build my own sandwich. Portions are ALWAYS HUGE. Which is perfect for leftovers. Honestly their meats are so flavorful and tender to eat on their own, which I definitely do. But still like alternating with sauce as well.   And what's a BBQ joint without sides? Thy have Some of the best Mac n cheese. Half the reason I go there is because I get a craving for that alone. Which they top off with the base of their secret rub. Their potato and macaroni salad are money, which get the same sprinkling. Baked beans are on point, and their cornbread muffins are amazing. Can't remember the others they have. I usually go with Mac n cheese and potato salad. And I always get a cornbread muffin and happily pay extra for it. I don't say this lightly, but their cornbread is the best I've ever had, period (sorry grandma)   On top of some of the best food out there, the staff is awesome. They are very knowledgeable about their products and happy to suggest things or accommodate any special request, which is rare in food service. Just went in, and the guy at the counter recommended trying their \"zippy mustard glaze\" I was hesitant since I had never tried mustard anything on BBQ, and their crazy js spicy BBQ sauce is so good. But I told him I'd try it, and can honestly say I'm glad I did. Because as  of right now, I'm currently alternating dipping between the two. So good.   Top it all off, throw in a celebrity chef endorsement by Guy Fieri and you got yourself a winning combination ;)"}
{"text":"The place is filthy dirty. All surfaces, floors, walls and condiment bottles a mess.  Pork OK, but sides flavorless. No recommendation here and won't be back."}
{"text":"After a little hiatus, Foodie Friday resumed yesterday and BBQ was the pick and it was delicious! My friend and I shared the platter where we could try 4 types of meat. Chicken, brisket, sausage and pulled pork. As for sides we tried potato salad, macaroni salad, mac n cheese and cornbread. My favorite was the brisket and mac n cheese. Delicious and worth a repeat visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, huge portions, amazing staff and kids eat free on Mondays. What else can you ask for!?!?"}
{"text":"I stopped by to pick up some lunch to bring home for the family. The experience was good but not quite as good as I remembered. They were out of pork. When the item is in your name, you should probably make more of an effort. I bought some corn breads which were roundly criticized by my family. The guy who helped me could not answer some pretty basic questions and did not seem particularly well-trained. Chicken was excellent and brisket was okay (C+). Mostly I feel like this place is a closed club for guys. There is very little direction or help. Seems like they only want their regulars and by that I mean men who are there all the time and know the drill."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Hubby and I tried the monster sampler plate with mac & cheese and baked beans, beans had a spicy flavor in them...awesome!!! Pork was out of this world with great smoked flavor, brisket was perfect!! There wasn't a negative thing about our experience honestly everyone working there was so friendly- even bought one of their tshirts!! Must try it's worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't tell you how the bbq is as they were out of ribs at 6:30p when they close at 8. But hey they will have ONE rack available in 30min if you're in the area. Looks like the other reviews were right, I'll stick to naked bbq."}
{"text":"Oooh sweet lord baby jeezus I love this bbq! And omg the mac and cheese my mouth is watering as I type!"}
{"text":"First time trying. Great portion of pulled pork - tender and juicy. The BBQ Beans are VERY good. The potato salad was bland but not awful. I wasn't impressed with their sauces but mixing the spicy with the smokey gave me something acceptable. The mustard based glaze was good but I'll have to try that one something else next time.  And there will be a next time. The staff was great. The hole-in-the-wall places are usually good. Oh yeah, bring your own plastic spoon! You'll want it to get every drop of those beans!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit gluten sensitive, so stayed away from the sandwiches and wraps. Decided on the Big Boy Sampler: Brisket, Pulled Pork, Pulled Chicken and Sausage. All were great, but the Chicken and Sausage was extra-ordinary! Staying away from the gluten and heavy carbs, I went with the slaw. Only good, but I'll probably get it again.   Taking a star away... the ecologist in me doesn't like all the paper containers used to measure the meat out. Styrofoam and plastic take-out (and dine in) containers - I wish there was something else."}
{"text":"I went to the farmer's market in Old Town with a friend this morning.  I wanted to bring home something for husband to eat and he really loves pulled pork so I went with POAF.  The gentleman running the stand was really friendly and helpful.  I got a pulled pork sandwich a bag of chips and water for $7.  I got him a side of the spicy BBQ sauce to go with it.  He LOVED it.  At first he was kind of unhappy I woke up him at 10:00 am but after he saw what I brought him he changed his tune!  He said it was one of the best pulled pork sandwiches he'd ever had and the BBQ sauce was delicious.  The pork was juicy and had a nice smoke flavor, it wasn't overpowering it was just right.  We will be going to the restaurant to check out the full menu."}
{"text":"Everything here is so delicious. I would highly recommend the Midwest sandwich paired with any side. I personally like the macaroni salad and beans.  Expect a wait at almost any time of the day."}
{"text":"I tried Pork on a Fork at the ASU Tempe farmers market. Beef brisket and pulled pork sandwiches were sold there in a small tent.  My sandwich (brisket) was very tasty, albeit a little plain (just meat and bread). There were three great BBQ sauces available - sweet/mild, tart, and spicy. I used a lot of all three, but spicy was the best. I felt like I could drink those sauces!  At $6-8, the sandwiches are a little pricey, but they are filling and taste excellent. It would be nice if they came with some corn, beans, or the like to round out the meal."}
{"text":"I ordered food for my friend and I online 5/9/18 and we had been talking about dining here for months now. That said, I placed a carry out order and she picked it up Wednesday (last night). We both ordered ribs and a couple sides. The ribs were inedible. They claim to have the \"best bbq in the valley\", this is far from best. I should have taken it back."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. It has a different feel then the deer valley location but both locations are equally awesome."}
{"text":"Fantastic! My favorite is the pork with extra pickles, waffle fries, and mac n cheese! I would recommend this place to anyone. Meat is always cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I went for the first time this week and enjoyed the food. The brisket was a bit dry (normal for brisket) by delicious with bbq sauce! The chicken was mediocre, not bad just not great. It had a strong chicken flavor to it and not much else. The pulled pork was delicious! I was disappointed in the size of the cornbread vs the other sides. The mac and cheese was an appropriate portion and delicious. My girlfriend loved the macaroni salad. She orders a sandwich with two meats. Unfortunately, the girls forgot to put the bread in! Not the worst mistake in the world but very disappointing when you want a sandwich. We will likely give them a try again. Next time I would probably try the ribs and get more brisket/pulled pork."}
{"text":"You can tell these guys like what they do. Food is prepared nicely and they are a fast casual type of place. The lunch crowd fills this place pretty regularly but I want to come in at night to try a rack of ribs next. I had the brisket sandwich and it did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I have eaten their food before at special events and decided to give their restaurant a try. I have lived in Texas and eaten at plenty of BBQ places as I travel for work. I would say the POAF is really good BBQ. I usually judge BBQ by their brisket because it is either good or bad with nothing in between. The brisket was very tender with a nicely spiced thick bark. The pulled pork was good but a bit on the dry side. Sausage and chicken were also very good.I would recommend them as one of the best BBQ places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in North Phoenix.  Sauce isn't the best  but the pork, brisket, and chicken are Wonderful without any.  The mac n cheese is a must get side.  Baked beans are good too.  Love this place"}
{"text":"Stopped in Saturday afternoon and ordered the BBQ bowl with pork, mac & cheese and cole slaw.  Such a great combination...warm, cold, soft, crunchy.  I added their mustard-based sauce on top.  Also ordered a smoked sausage..just the right amount of spice and snap.  The place looks great and the staff was very friendly.  They also brew a variety of iced teas....loved the watermelon tea."}
{"text":"Wow, that is some great BBQ.  Probably the best I have had in Arizona.  The pork was great as were the BBQ beans.  I will be there again and again!"}
{"text":"I am the odd man out in that I am not a big meat fan. Had heard about POAF on Yelp and had driven by a lot of times before. I was getting pretty excited thinking about BBQ chicken though.   I had no problem finding it because they have a little sign at the entrance to the complex. There isn't much parking though. I took forever to decide what to order but finally got the sampler for hubby with pork, sausage, and brisket. I ordered the chicken sandwich myself. We got cornbread, Mac n' cheese, beans, and cole slaw for our sides. I took samples of three sauces to go.   My favorite ended up being the brisket, and I don't even like red meat! Hubby actually loved my chicken the most. I was pretty impressed with their Mac n'cheese. I would eat it and I am super picky about Mac n'cheese.   You come for the BBQ though, and it doesn't disappoint. We had to go back the next night it was so good. That brisket with its deeply smokey flavor and its perfect smoke ring! Definitely the best BBQ I have ever had."}
{"text":"What a meal, definitely a stick to your ribs ( no pun intended) kind of meal. Had the mac and cheese base w/ corn, bbq beans. Then topped it off with the brisket and cole slaw. The brisket was tender and smoky and delish. Could only eat half of my bowl, so a good deal for alot of food!!! Well done \"Pork on a Fork\", see you soon!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here because someone reportedly said that this place has the best man n cheese in the valley. That claim has been confirmed."}
{"text":"The food is awesome--all of it. We ordered for 20 people and got 2 family meals, and salads--it was plenty!! Hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent ribs, great sauce, sides were good too.  Located in a storefront, nothing fancy, but excellent food. We will return."}
{"text":"I walked in and didn't have a clue what I wanted, but the guy behind the counter recommended the brisket and walked me through the options (bowl, burrito, sandwich, etc). I went with the brisket burrito, and when he cut the brisket I could see the juices pouring off it. It was the most tender and juicy piece of brisket I've ever had. I want to try the pork, chicken, and polish dog too, but it'll be hard to pass up the brisket.  The layout of the place is a little unconventional because it's in a business park, but the seating area was clean and they had the Dbacks game on (always a bonus)."}
{"text":"Came here with my family and friends. It's been along time since I have eaten here. The rest of my family has not been here so I wanted to show them how good it was. The place was clean inside unlike other reports and food was very good as it has been in the past. We will be back again also I want to let it be known that the service and all the staff were very nice, caring and out going."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ. I got the sampler and the meats were tender and moist, especially the brisket. Sweet & Mild sauce was my favorite of the sauces. Mac & Cheese was particularly good too. This place is comparable to the authentic Texas BBQ I'm used to and I will definitely be back. Employee Ashley was very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu and helping me decide what to try."}
{"text":"My brisket and ribs were as dry as a bone! Needed to was every bite down with my drink."}
{"text":"Been a couple times and besides it being packed at lunch the food and people were great!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. The guy who took my order was rude and slow. The place looks dirty and all employees grossed me out. Meat was fatty and Cole slaw had zero flavor. Only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is the Mac and cheese was good. Don't bother visiting."}
{"text":"My brother introduced me to POTF couple of weeks ago. I was hooked. Took my friend there last week now he is hooked. Food is truly out of this world and BBQ is not even my favorite food .. Pizza is. Will go here again and bring more friends with me next time."}
{"text":"What shall  I tell you first? Another great strip mall non descript place hidden in an industrial area. I do have to say they did a great job making the restauarant look clean , inviting and very functional for a very small space.  I definitely will be back ...love the smoky flavor of the meat, sweet and throughly washing the meat with flavor  and the sweet pink ring  that makes the meat  and you know its the real  smoky deal. they have lots of choices of sauces but it was juicy and flavorful enough that I could have eaten it without sauce. The flavors were great  all around even my daughter's waffle fries was really tasty. We loved the smoky sweet white BBQ beans. Our friends Paul and Paula ( see Paul I mentioned you ...now write your own darn review)  had brisket and a tasty smoked sausage which looked great and the bites I had were delicious.   Prices are very reasonable and the service was perfect.    Look for them at local farmers markets , Friday night dinners (prime and ribs mmm)  and hopefully a bigger site s I can bring my friends."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The beef brisket and a drink costs $12. The taste is average at best. I would suggest serving this dish without the bun and put the bbq sauce on the meat. Instead of letting the customer squeeze some sauce out of a bottle.  The bratwurst is ok and the pulled pork is average, nothing that really blows you away. The seating at lunch is crowded and somehow needs to be re-configured with maybe a couple of dueces instead of all 4 seat tables. That way the single diners don't take up all the 4 spots."}
{"text":"You can't see this place from the road since it's hidden in a business mall across from the Deer Valley Airport. This is a very casual order at the counter kind of place and your food quickly gets ran to you.  I tried the smoked chicken and was expecting it to be pulled BBQ Chicken but instead it was two chicken thighs. The chicken was very moist and tender with a careful gentle light smoke flavor. I thought it was very good and didn't really need any sauce but I had to try one of the assorted sauces on the table for fun. This plate comes with two sides I tried the cole slaw and it seemed very fresh, was sort of sweet but it was drip free so I thought that was good. I also tried the macaroni and cheese, it was seasoned nicely and was familiar like what you eat at a picnic.  My husband tried the Monster that was described to us as brisket and pulled pork with two sides. It however is a sandwich of the two meats together topped with coleslaw. Like the smoked chicken I had the meat in this sandwich isn't all sauced up but you can use the assorted sauces on the table if you care too. My husband did like the sandwich and said it was very good but would order something different next time because he's been here before and liked the regular plates better. He said the beans here are very porky.   The staff thanked us for coming as we were leaving."}
{"text":"Unassuming business park location knocks it out of the park with competition style BBQ.    You may ask yourself \"What does competition style BBQ really mean?\", you won't find ribs that fall off the bone, dainty plating or complex flavor profiles BUT what you will find is high grade meat, cooked to perfection with a down home side dishes and menu options using fresh alternatives.  This BBQ Joint brings a wicked burrito stuffed with beans, cheese and whatever kind of meat you want (Pork, Beer or Chicken) or go with the Midwest Monster, a BBQ sandwich piled high.  For those looking for more traditional BBQ fare, order the Pulled Pork or Brisket Sandwiches or just go with a half-rack of the killer pork ribs.  Ambiance in straight forward as the space is a converted business park location, but that doesn't mean it doesn't feel good.  Lots of BBQ posters, farm pictures and contest memorabilia let you know these guys take their food seriously.  Ample seating in the back room and the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and very approachable. Great value for the amount of food you get per order, but the best is buying bulk pounds either take-out or eat picnic style at your table.  Good mixture of POAF branded sauces which add another layer to the wonderful taste of fresh BBQ and quality meats..  Keep up the great work guys and gals!"}
{"text":"Had their brisket for lunch.  It was very tender and had good flavor.  My friend had the pork sandwich.  It was lean and good portions too.  I really like their sauces, though their meat doesn't really need it.    PRO:  great BBQ, good portions, good selection of sides, friendly service  CON: It's a little on the expensive side.  $12 for lunch? Really?  Meh, it was worth it :-)  Can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Only tried their lunch menu so far.  $11.47 for Brisket sandwich, 2 sides and their smallest soda(size=large) + tax.   Great brisket, fair prices, and generous portions.  Very tasty and stands well without the sauce.  I found the Smokey sauce the best flavor of the three offered but it also tastes a bit too salty.  I found I enjoyed lunch without the sauce and that is exactly how it is served - saucless.  My two sides were the Sweet Potatoe Fries and Potato Salad.  Both were 2 thumbs up but you get more fries than potato salad.  If quantity counts, then weigh that in.  Lunch was a bit crowded and seating was tough to come by.  Every server there seemed concerned that we would enjoy our visit.  Bottom line: I'll be back and it is worth seeking out.  Really want to try their Pork next!  PS - Gotta pay attention to find it.  Look for the coffee shop facing Deer Valley Road, with the Green sign that mimics Starbucks. PoF is located adjacent and behind that."}
{"text":"My coworkers went here for lunch. Last time they went they said the food was great. This time, we all agreed it was disappointing. I had the bbq bowl and the Mac n cheese was awfully bland. It was more like Mac and a touch of butter. The lemonade was super watery as well. I'm sure it can be better than this, but if I'm paying $10+ for my meal, it shouldn't be a hit or miss experience."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, the food was \"off the charts\" good. Slowly over the years though, it has slid considerably. Really is too bad, They had some amazing food... Recently, I've had a couple bad experiences and I'm just no longer a fan. My family and I love good BBQ and are disappointed by what's happening."}
{"text":"Just writing a review about Pork on a Fork makes my mouth water. Best BBQ I've had in years and hands down best since moving to Arizona. The food is absolutely amazing and service seems to be pretty good as well (have only ordered take out but they resolved an issue quickly and painlessly when something was left out of our order). Only complaint I have is the online ordering isn't 100% clear and doesn't mirror the menu online but the amazing food made me forget all about that. If you're getting take out on a Friday night, order early. Wait has ranged from one to two  hours - 100% worth the wait."}
{"text":"Sigh...I'm bummed I have to rate a local business 3 stars.  Was looking for BBQ off the highway as we were headed on a road trip and came across this place. I tried to order online but couldn't complete the order for whatever reason. So, I called and was greeted by a friendly employee who took my order. She initially said it would take 15-20 min, but said 10 when she heard we were coming up the highway. (Didn't request faster service, but it was a nice gesture).   I get there a few minutes after the time and they hadn't started on the food. Okay...well, maybe they had a weird rush at 3:30 on a Tuesday.   Then, one of the employees informed me that one of the sides (salad) was several days past its expiration. It was the only one they had. Boo, but yay! that they actually pay attention to their expiration dates. But it does seem kind of odd that it wasn't just yesterday it expired, that they ran out,  and hadn't replenished. But...oh well, not meant to be healthy today.   We get our order around the 20 min mark (which is the length the employee initially said it would take) and hit the road. However, once we dig in (BBQ burritos is an awesome travel idea!) we see that they didn't get our order right, the mac and cheese noodles seemed...hard, and the fries didn't seem fresh.   If we give this place a second chance and it turns out great, I absolutely will update the rating. But for now, 3 is all I can give."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the brisket sandwich & Mac & cheese & Cornbread. Always order the same thing!"}
{"text":"I love this place but we could not get any food! The assembly line sucks. The lady responsible for serving the meat is very slow . We waited in line for almost 30 minutes and the cashiers had to wait for people as we waited for the meat lady to serve the food. We had to leave because we had 8 people in front of us and the line had not moved. it was 12:30 we left at 1:00. Management needs to review there process. other BBQ restaurants have the concept down ... it's not the size of your kitchen it's your set up. you have so many employees watching one person serve meat.. we saw 3 plus the 2 cashiers. Food is amazing ..... your line set up is all wrong."}
{"text":"... good place to get good BBQ.  Our daughter is in the \"don't feed me anything but mac and cheese\" phase and she looooves their Mac and cheese! Location is rough since it's placed in more of an industrial type facility. Worth looking for."}
{"text":"Brace yourself for the most \"Texas\" tasting Bbq in town!! 4 different types of sauce to top it all off. Our family has just adopted the sweetest manager Jake as he whipped out a quarter to satisfy our 5 year olds \"dessert\" treat as a finale of the best dinner ever event!! Yeehaw hubbie from Houston is Finally satisfied!! Ps mac n cheese is a kid pleaser.  We'll be regulars no doubt.  Sounds  like they are going to be growing too hooray!! Thanks so much boys for the great smiles and warm service."}
{"text":"The food was very good! I really enjoyed the pulled pork and beef brisket! I would have to say that it was absolutely finger lickin' goodness! All of the valley must try, it was well worth a 35 mile drive!!! Best in the valley! The Mac-n-cheese was cheesy heaven too! Great staff and wonderful customer service! Tatiana was extremely helpful in assisting me in my meal choices! YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Although the food is pretty good, I can't get over how slow service is and it makes me wonder if they have the right people working behind the counter.  I stopped in today to get my lunch to go. I figured it would be an in and out type deal. WRONG. I stood in line for about 20 minutes (there was 3 or so people in front of me) while the first guy behind the counter who loads the meat on to the plate seemed to move slower than a sloth. Not to mention that his hair was completely covering his face making it next to impossible for him to see. He kept swinging and flipping all his hair around trying to make it so he could at least see a little something (don't think it helped). I sat there and watched him do it, dreading the fact I'll probably be seeing a hair of his in my food... I feel like he was the hold up for the entire line...everyone else seemed to be a bit quicker. Maybe they need to rethink having that guy there at the front."}
{"text":"We orders two salads, $10 a piece expected some thing pretty hearty. It was like a dinner salad with a little meat on it. Total waste of money. If your hungry go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Writing this after my second visit:   Food is pretty good, but the service needs attention! Hoping the owners and/or mgmt read and address the following. I live within walking distance, and bbq is one of my favorite foods.  My 3rd visit will be make or break for this place.    1st visit, March 2016: They were open approx 2-3 weeks, we had a party of 5 adults and 2 young kids.  I think our bill was around $70.  After leaving, we all agreed the staff was the worst part of the visit: lack of attention, lackadaisical attitude toward customers, less-than-professional counter attendents, we were generally not impressed.  When we ordered, 3 of us ordered mac-n-cheese for our sides.  The kid behind the counter said \"We've run out, we're making another batch now and it will be ready in 5 minutes\".  That's understandable, no big deal.  We sat down.  There were approximately 3 other tables of customers there, so not busy by any means, and we were the largest group at that time.  We sat within sight of the cash register.  20 minutes later, as I was finishing up my Pulled Pork sandwich, I decided to get up and ask the guy if our mac-n-cheese sides were ready yet.  He said \"Oh yes\" and asked how many I needed, to which I replied \"3\", and he handed them right over.   Why didn't they bring them to our table when they were ready?  Did he really forget how many orders were needed for the item that they were out of?  Wouldn't this be a priority for them?   Anyway, at least we thought our food was tasty.  We chalked up the oversight to new employees and a new restaurant.    2nd visit:  3 months later.  We arrived at 11:20am, they open at 11.  Guy 1 stood behind the cash register, I'm not sure what he was doing, but he had no customers at that moment.  There was one table of customers already seated and eating.  Guy 2 was putting together an order right in front of the 3 of us.  We were looking at the menu for a minute or so, but about 4 to 5 minutes passed before anyone acknowledged us.  We saw the line cook throw a large bag of frozen waffle fries from the cold storage to the countertop (fresh - never frozen?).  Finally Guy 2 took our order.  Then Guy 1 rang us up.  Bill was $48 including the 15% tip I left (which sort of irks me - because nobody brings your meal to the table or waits on you - the staff does nothing more than a McDonalds employee does. I'm happy to leave (and usually at least) a 20% tip when wait staff does what they're supposed to do.)  These guys were nice enough, but both acted like they'd rather be somewhere else.  I then went to get my drink - and the floor between the soda fountain and the tea was completely sticky as if some kid had spilled a soda... but there were no kids inside and they had only been open 20 minutes.  Kinda gross... and inattentive especially considering Guy 1 wasn't doing anything for the first 4-5 minutes we were in the store, not to mention he was standing only 4 feet from the sticky mess.  ??  I might expect that at Peter Piper... but not at a place like this.  Anyway, again, our food was at least tasty.  And then my buddy (who I was taking to lunch), unprovoked, made a comment at the table to the effect of \"the staff sure isn't helping this place at all\".  Which is my entire point... there are too many restaurants in this area to choose from to spend that sort of money and feel like the staff could care less if you were even there.  I was hoping they'd have the staff ironed out 3 months into being opened.  I'll try again next month I guess.     Bottom line: good food, lousy staff.  Pork on a fork - you're soooo close to being my \"go-to\"."}
{"text":"Food is great. We have eating here for about 3 yrs. a little disappointed, they charge extra now for some of their sides they call \"premium \" like their mac-n-cheese (which is fabulous) and they have reduced the size of their sides. A bit expensive for what you get. You won't be disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"Gonna try the pulled pork, It was probably the best thing on the menu! Although i didn't anything else.   Had lunch here with some co-workers. One had the full rack baby back ribs. It looked good, other had the ultimate lunch (it came with a little bit of everything). They said the pulled pork was the best thing. I had the pulled pork. The pork was good. The BBQ sauce was a little weak, wish they had something more spicey. But i would go again just to have the pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Pretty good barbecue  Overall, Pork on a Fork was exactly what I would expect. The food was good and everyone left happy.  Pork on a fork offers five different sauces, from mild and sweet to smoky and spicy, including a mustard-based sauce, which was pretty good. On this visit find lunch Companions and I I had the pulled pork sandwich, a brisket burrito, chicken, coleslaw, cornbread, and macaroni and cheese.  All of our entrees were  tasty and I really had no complaints, other than I'm really not a fan of bbq.  The sauce selection was good, the cole slaw was not overly sweet though underseasoned, the macaroni and cheese , waffle fries, were all okay.  If you're in the area, and enjoy bbq, check out pork on a fork you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great store and staff good job Camelback store !!! Great bbq the staff was awesome! Reminds me of Texas BBq!!! Good job guys! And gals!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the bbq pork sandwich and the ambience of the place. Staff are friendly and is a clean, Neat place, good food... I'll be back"}
{"text":"Great sandwich with a choice of 4 different sauces on the table.....the side orders included were well sized and very tasty!  The mac and cheese was my favorite.  I didn't notice any desserts.......they need something to compliment the bbq like a key lime pie or something."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner. Got the mix combination brisket, chicken, and pork. Brisket and chicken were good. Pork was ok, nothing special. The sides were mac and cheese and corn bread. I would recommend not using corn bread as a side. You get 1 small muffin and it was dry. My opinion you pay more and get less not only on quantity but taste as well. The bbq sauces stood out the most in my meal. Vinegar based. Tangy and spice."}
{"text":"So disappointing. The most disappointing part was the service. It was fine that they didn't have ribs, but the cashier was deliberately unhelpful and unfriendly. It turns out the ribs were about 15 minutes way from being finished. Sure wish they would have mentioned that because we would have waited. Then they failed to clarify whether we wanted a plate or sandwich. When the brisket came out chopped up on a terrible, soggy, cold bun, I was so bummed out. Apparently I'm not the only one to have had this problem. Right before I was about to send mine back, another customer took hers back to the counter saying she had wanted a plate and not a sandwich. They dumped the meat off the bun onto the plate, threw away the bun, and handed her back the plate. God.  The coleslaw was watery, the Mac and Cheese was dried out and the sauce was broken. The waffle fries were fine.   I would have gone back to this place, but the service was intolerable. What a waste of a meal and money."}
{"text":"Stopped in Christmas Eve while I was doing last minute shopping. So happy to see they have beer now! Everything was still really good, and the staff was friendly too."}
{"text":"Still love their product, but their online ordering process just doesn't work.  First time, my order was sent to the wrong market.  Second time, I was shorted a package of chops.  I checked the bag before I left the market, so it was only a minor inconvenience.  Third time I ordered bacon, which was listed as available on the web site, and then contacted and advised it was not and may not be available for a few weeks.  Since I paid upon ordering, I had to go through the hassle of waiting for a refund.  I've also noticed inconsistency in portion size which is a problem considering you pay by product, rather than pound.  Boneless chops should be roughly 6-oz each, yet I've received 4-oz chops at times, resulting in 50% less product for the same price.  Not a deal breaker for me, but something to consider.  I continue to purchase from these guys regularly, but no longer try to order ahead.  And I do wish they would have bacon available more often!"}
{"text":"This place is all about the smoked meat.  The rating is for that AND the stellar service from friendly people who clearly love serving up the best dang smoked meat in the city and take a lot of pride in it.  (Amanda really went out of her way to welcome us and share her fantastic special, which was chicken taquitos).  The atmosphere is not dirty or smelly so I can't really call it a \"dive.\"  But, it isn't glamorous (see my first sentence).  You are coming here for the smoked meat that your brother-in-law believes he makes (but can't).  Just get in here and bring your appetite because this beef brisket is ridiculously good.  The chicken, pulled chicken, and sausage were all amazing -even without sauce - but, make sure you get the brisket!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience tonight! Food was outstanding! Great service by Tracy and Raul. And I love the hot barbeque sauce! The pork didn't stay on my fork for very long, I kept shoveling it in my mouth!!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Pick your meat, sides.  4 awesome sauces at the table.  Got the deluxe sampler. Chicken, pork and brisket. BBQ beans are good and some great potato salad."}
{"text":"I've been coming this place for the last year and I've generally liked it but the last time was probably my last time going there my son and I went my son had the pulled pork sandwich I had the Midwest monster and I'm not sure if it was the girl behind the counter whoever made it not sure but the girl behind the counter seemed very new kind of didn't know what she was doing and when I got home after spending 13 dollars my sandwich alone it was all fat complete fat so I will never go back. Hate giving certain barbecue place has bad reviews but that topped the cake"}
{"text":"Meat was very greasy and fatty. Sides were very small and forgettable."}
{"text":"The customer service was very good. The food LOOKED amazing and SMELLED amazing but the flavor was just meh.   The food was pretty bland and the pulled pork and brisket were dry. The smoked sausage looked and tasted overcooked. The macaroni and cheese could have benefited from a better blend of cheeses and the sprinkling of red pepper on top was unnecessary. The sweet potato fries were awesome, but it's pretty hard to mess up sweet potato fries.   Compared to BBQ that I've had in the past (Jim n' Nicks, Famous Dave's, Rudy's and Slick Pig (in Murfreesboro, TN)) this is definitely the lowest on the totem pole to me."}
{"text":"Awesome friendly service and delicious food.  The waffle fries are great and pulled pork is lean and tasty! My side salad was crisp and fresh. They have 4 different bbq sauces. I Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Most of the places that I have gone to using a groupon are either okay to horrible.  That is probably why they are on groupon.  So I tend to stay away from groupon, except if they advertise for a place I have been wanting to try.  Groupon worked out in this case.    Hubby had the pulled pork and I had the brisket sandwich.  Both came with a side of mac n cheese, waffles fries, and corn bread.  Everything was very good except the cornbread.  The pulled pork was a tad dry but it was still tasty.  The price for everything was actually kinda expensive without a groupon.  Location is very unassuming.  Its hidden in a industrial area near the Deer Valley airport.  When you walk in, it looks like there is no seating except for 3 small tables, but if you walk to the back past the bathrooms, there is more.  I most likely will be back with or without a groupon."}
{"text":"The meat was very well cooked but I couldn't really tell the pork from the chicken. I was rather disappointed with the barbecue sauces. This is not the place to come if you expect your barbecue to come off the grill.  The sides we chose were good -side salads (two choices for dressing), Cole slaw,  baked beans. The service was on the slow side. It was clean, and not too noisy. Overall, other than trying something new, I probably won't return here in the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"i will admit i am not a total bbq connoisseur or anything but have had some great bbq in texas. this place had REALLY good ribs and sausage. the rest, i wasn't super crazy about, but that probably doesn't mean anything since it's not like i really know what good brisket should taste like. i thought the pulled pork needed sauce. i don't remember much about the chicken. i did like the bbq sauce choices though. and the sides were solid. i 100% will be going back for some ribs - YUM!!"}
{"text":"Without Yelp and GPS, you'd probably never find this place. It's hidden behind a coffee bar in an industrial office park. They clearly have a strict sign ordinance in Phoenix, because there is no visible signage to this place.   The best & biggest pulled pork sandwich I've ever had is from 2-Paul's in Lafayette, Louisiana. Pork on a Fork is a close second. If 2-Paul's is a 10 for flavor, PoF is an 8.5. For size, 2-Paul's being a 10, PoF is an 11. 2-Paul's PP sandwich is huge...but at PoF, I watched the guy plop a load onto the sandwich that would have been the limit at most places, and then he proceeded to drop an even bigger load on top of that. This thing was monstrous. I also ordered 2 ribs (for 3 bucks extra). They were about 1/3 the size of 2-Paul's ribs, but tasty none the less.  I tried 3 different sauces: sweet & mild, hot, and crazy j's (the guy loading the sandwich said it was his favorite). Well, I'm glad I took the recommendation, because it was the best of the 3 sauces.  Now that I've eaten all that stuff, I'm going to have to go to sleep. I'll have to sleep on my back, though. I'll pop if I roll over."}
{"text":"The brisket was worth the trip! It was flavorful and had a nice smoke ring to it. There was not much fat on it, and they were nice thick cuts. The pork was very moist, but I just wasn't tasting all the flavor I was expecting.  The restaurant itself was low key, but I really liked the seating area in the back. It is set up in a garage area, and is just something different. Their barbeque  sauce selection has everything you could want. I found that a mixture of the sweet with the smokey was the flavor for me.    The only thing I would have liked would have been to order a quarter pound of one of the meats instead of having to get a half or whole pound. I was hoping to try a couple of different things but I didn't want to have to order another half pound of meet.  Overall I it was good and I will be going back there at some point."}
{"text":"I've had a hankering for Pulled pork a lot recently and had never tried this restaurant so I decided to stop in for sandwiches to go.  The location is a little hard to find and could use a bit more signage coming from the east on Deer Valley. As I walked in what struck me were the floors, I know I won't be eating off them but the concrete looked dirty and stained and it set a tone for me.   The sides were average, and they have a nice selection of good barbecue sauces. The pulled pork sandwiches were good, but fairly pricey. It's not my go-to spot, but is a great little place with friendly employees and a good location."}
{"text":"We enjoyed really good barbecue today. Hubby said that it made his top ten. Shared ribs and brisket and Mac n' Cheese, Potato Salad, Mac Salad and Coleslaw. 3 choices of sauce: Hot, Smokey and Sweet. I was not happy that when cutting my brisket the server got to the crusty heel, paused knowing that he shouldn't serve the piece but did so anyway. And yes I did ask for and receive a new portion.  Dine in is located in what would be the warehouse and shop of this industrial suite and this is where I knock off stars. Not because of the location but because of the \"amenities\". Long tables with dried on sauce, filthy dispensers for plastic forks and knives, a sloppy, disgusting garbage can, and one smelly bathroom.   I think the owners need to spend some time acting like they are customers so that they can realize our experience. Your hands are sticky with sauce and your only option is to wait for the one bathroom to clear, get knocked in the face with the fumes from the person before you (who for some reason left the seat up) just so you can wash your hands. Even the door is filthy. Clean all of the bathroom and provide wet wipes would be a great place to start."}
{"text":"OMG! I'm no BBQ expert, but this place is by far the best BBQ I've had in Phoenix. Beans cooked with the burnt meat ends in them? Oh! they are the bomb!!!!! The only disappointing thing was the lemonade. When I asked about it, they directed me to the drink fountain. If all you serve is Minutemaid Lemonade, don't put that as a separate item on your menu. Come on man!"}
{"text":"I have tried as many different places for BBQ as I could, looking for something that would do the trick. I was sorely disappointed for several years until FINALLY, Pork on a Fork popped up and around the corner from work, no less. This is BY FAR the best BBQ in the Valley. HANDS DOWN. Don't go anywhere else because you'll just be wasting your time and taste buds.  No matter where you live in the Valley, it is def worth the drive to come eat here. Just look out for the little flag on Deer Valley because you can easily miss it, being in the industrial park where it is. Over the past year, I tried everything on the menu and was never disappointed. Literally, everything is great! Tender meat, delicious sauces (I would bathe in the Crazy J's sauce), and awesome sides. Now that I no longer live in AZ, I miss this place dearly, so I had to come on here to show some love.   Why haven't you gotten in your car to head over already?! Seriously, go there NOW! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I would describe this place as like the Great Value brand of Rudy's. Yummy barbecue and southern vibe to it. The macaroni salad and potato salad is AWESOME. The best I've had in the north Valley. Portions are filling and there are like six different choices of barbecue sauce, all deliciois. This is a fun place to stop with family and friends. Brisket and shredded pork is juicy and full of flavor, I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean decent atmosphere but I'm from Texas and the food did not meet my standards for good BBQ. Not to say it's bad. The meat was tender but I'd prefer Dickey's over this place. The favors were off. The sauces were too sweet for me, the Mac and cheese had pasty cheese, and the rice was a bit too dry and bland."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to trying this place, were bummed to be disappointed. I found three LARGE chunks of sharp bone in my pulled pork sandwich. Got pork sliders off the kids menu for my son and most of the pork was a few cuts of super fatty pork, so thick I could barely cut it with the plastic fork. When we let them know about the bone they replaced their pork shoulder and offered us another sandwich and sides. The guy was very apologetic. Not sure if we'll give it another go or not. Appreciate he tried to make it better."}
{"text":"Loved the boneless pork chop too! They are small, but appropriate serving size (a little bit bigger than a deck of cards when cooked). I just lathered with Trader Joe's garlic mustard aoli and grilled for a few minutes. It was delicious tender and juicy!"}
{"text":"\"I can't just give you free food\" My wife told me how amazing your food is. Her work has it catered often. My first visit to Pork on a fork was amazing due to the quality of their food. The chicken, pork, sausage and beef sampler was amazing. I tried the zesty and mild sauces and both were delicious. My wife placed an online order for the Deluxe Big Boy. We get to the location and Paige let's us know that the double sides are actually only single and we'd have to pay for additional sides. I make the comment that I just want what I paid for and she quickly responded with \"I can't just give you free food\" in a very defensive tone. Why didn't management just fix this glitch? So Paige tells us the sides are $1.50 so we pay an additional $3.24 to complete our already paid for order. My wife and I finally get away on a staycation and I refused to let something like this get to me. Any other day I would have asked for management and walked out with my double sides as mentioned online without an additional charge! This glitch prints out on the receipt too!!! Get with the web designer. Easy, hassle free fix!"}
{"text":"It is very hard to find decent BBQ in Phoenix. We heard about this place from some friends so we thought we would check it out. I had the Pulled Pork sandwich with Mac 'n Slaw. BBQ staples in my opinion. If you cant get that right then don't  bother. I was very pleased with the result. The Pork was cooked to perfection. The Mac 'n Slaw were both excellent. Only thing we did not care for was the restaurant itself. It is in a business park and looks like it used to be a mechanics shop or something. But the ambiance is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5. We would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Main Dish: Pulled Pork sandwich  Sides: Mac & cheese & sweet potato fries Drink: Sweet Tea   Pulled pork was bigger pieces than most pulled pork that is stringy. Bread for sandwich was amazing & fluffy. Comes with no sauce, you can add the one you like from the tables. Cooked just right.   Sides were amazing! Everyone does Mac and cheese different & I loved this one. They even shake some seasoning on it as they serve it which adds great flavor. SP Fries were perfection....seasoned and cooked just right!   Sweet tea was still warm so melted the ice but had good flavor!  I will be back next time I am in AZ! Keep up the great BBQ! Ps you know when cops and paramedics are eating there that it's good & they were ;)"}
{"text":"Great food.  The cuts are good and the meat is tender.  Great cornbread.  Beans good as well.  But the sauce is the boss as they offer 3 different types.  Relaxed location nice place to watch the game and enjoy some pork on a fork."}
{"text":"Was visiting Phoenix and so glad we found this place! We got their bowl and burrito with brisket in both. Everything was delicious! Their brisket, mac n cheese, and waffle fries were amazing. We were full from our meal but ended up ordering a sampler to-go because it was that good! Would love to see this place in Southern Cali one day. Service was friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"We just got back from trying Pork on a Fork's baby back ribs and here's my thoughts:  The good: 1) The ribs were EXCELLENT! Exactly the way I like them! The pulled pork was also good and served WITHOUT any sauce, so you can pick which sauce you prefer. 2) Four different home made BBQ sauces - Sweet and Mild, Smoky and Tangy, Hot and zippy mustard glaze and they have just made them available to purchase by the bottle, as well. 3) Very friendly and helpful staff. 4) Reasonable prices, quick service, clean restrooms,  5) You can order the food already smoked and cooked, but served cold in a foil baking tray to heat up at your own home at a later time or day. They recommend consuming it within 7 to 10 days which is more than reasonable and the ribs may be even better as they sit and soak up the sauce and become more tender. 6) Mac and cheese side dish is delicious!  The bad: 1) Hard to find the restaurant - its located in an industrial park. 2) Waffle fries don't taste as good as they look. I'm guessing these are not home made, but frozen from a mass manufacturer like Oreida or some such... 3) Different prices on some of the same dishes on Friday's only as well as other sides available on Fridays only from 4pm to 7pm. Its a bit confusing to have a Friday Menu that has many of the same items as the regular menu at a slightly higher price. I understand items like Smoked Salmon are only available on the Friday menu, but why is the regular menu disregarded on Fridays and the prices different? 4) Closes early (7pm Mon - Fri) and 3pm on Saturday.  Summary - This is our new favorite place for baby backs and pulled pork. Will try the beef brisket in the near future. Highly recommended!! And ,they accept debit and credit cards where many other small BBQ restaurants are cash only, which I find inconvenient. So that's a plus, as well."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! They always have fresh smoked meat and the sauce is amazing. A must try if you like BBQ."}
{"text":"My Husband and I decided to give this place a try tonight and take my parents along with us. The staff was friendly and helpful. The pork was great, the brisket was perfect (and not fatty!), the waffle fries were tasty and the mac and cheese was awesome and those who ordered them, liked the beans. My Husband liked his Midwest Monster and tore that sandwich up! Even the kid ate the pork slider and we can't get him to eat much of anything these days! Needless to say, we will definitely be coming back for more! The only thing I thought they could improve on are the buns. They were cold, not very tasty or toasted."}
{"text":"My wife and I catered this for our wedding, that should tell you how delicious it is. The pulled chicken is by far my favorite meat here. They are reasonably priced and very homey place. Their service is impeccable and I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Awesome BBQ. A little pricey though."}
{"text":"So excited they opened their second location on 20th Street and Camelback Road. I've been going to their original location on Deer Valley Rd for years. Just like the original, the ribs are incredible, the pulled pork is smoked to perfection and the Mac and cheese is simply addictive. Can't wait to have them cater my next event. And what makes them even better... they are locally owned and operated. Simply the best BBQ in the valley."}
{"text":"I got food by carry out. Great pulled pork and sausages!  Will be a repeat customer. A must try"}
{"text":"Not a hit!  I would like to think I am a BBQ Connoisseur which is why my wife went out of her way to get a gift card for us to visit. Very small place located just South of the Deer Valley Airpark.   Food:  I had a brisket sandwich with coleslaw and corn bread.  Brisket was not warm and bland.  The coleslaw wasn't terrible however finding the black hair halfway through didn't sit well with my stomach.  I did notice that NON of the employees were wearing hats or hairnets so that is a possible reason why.  The cornbread was a premium side which didn't make sense because of how small it was.  It was like a mini muffin which was cold to the point that the cool butter that was placed inside didn't melt.  The bottom half was completely stale and inedible.  My wife had the pork sandwich in which she agreed that it wasn't a very enjoyable.  She had coleslaw as well as the baked beans.  Nothing amazing to comment on here.    Service:  The service was brief because food was served out of chauffeurs.  Similar to a quick serve the food clearly wasn't made fresh.  Nice people I am sure but there is no engagement other than ordering.  I would not recommend pork on a fork because I have enjoyed many other BBQ Places around the valley.  If I wasn't given a gift card I wouldn't of visited and overall I was disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best in the valley!! I have had Barbecue all over the country and the brisket is the best I have ever had. Ribs are awesome as well.  I have both dined in and used them to cater my son's end of year baseball party.  Everyone at my party was so happy and we had plenty of food. Check them out as soon as you can!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great portions and super friendly staff.  Last time I was in the owners came by my table and said hello! Nice small business feeling."}
{"text":"The boys from Nebraska have been busy. They are slowly taking over N Phx with their smelly pits.   The pork was a little dry and had a slight hint of smoke, enough to know it's there, but not enough for me. The portion was prefect. The waffle fries were hot and good.   The staff was cool, a little small talk, a little jokes etc.   The sauces were all good. I like the Smokey and Tangy mixed with the hot for the pork. I like the mustard fir the fries.   The seating area and tables could use a cleaning. You can tell the staff cleans on the surface but not in-depth.   In general it is still a great place for bbq.   Support your local community... eat local."}
{"text":"Pulled pork, bbq beans and potato salad. And of course, all the sauces. Slap yo grandmama good!!!"}
{"text":"Eat here all the time for lunch. All of the employees are very friendly. The food is fantastic. I've ate plenty of great midwestern BBQ and this place ranks up there with the top. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Get off of my fork Get into my mouth Get off of that grill Get into some sauce (BBQ) Get into my belly yum yum, yeah  Get outta my mind Get into my life Oooooooooh Oh I said hey (Hey) you (You) Get into my belly (Lyrics - Billy Ocean - Get Into My Car)  Pork on a Fork was showcased on Drive-In, Dives, and Diners with Guy Fieri not too long ago.  From there they've became a hit and won numerous awards, plus rave reviews both on Yelp and from Foodies around the valley.  Needless to say, this place is pretty darn good wouldn't you say!    My office is close by so whenever I get a chance I try to hit the Fork.  Their Pulled Pork Sandwich is what I would consider the quintessential pulled pork meal. With sides of fingerling potatoes and coleslaw.  Good'o boys meal I guess, but man the pork and soft and tender; add some spicy bbq and finger licking good -- YUMMY!  Portions here are modest I think so you won't over eat in my opinion.    The place itself started in modest fashion.  When I first came there was maybe 6 tables max, but now they have an entire huge patio in the back.  Let's just after having a meal here you'll need more room - wink!  Again, this place is a dive so take the boys out and leave the dating scene out! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's been almost a year since my last review and thought it was time to share an update with my fellow Yelpers :^)  ======Smoky Goodness Alert========  Be prepared to smell smoky goodness upon entry of Pork on a Fork!!  It is highly addictive in intoxicating, so dinners beware!    Pork on a Fork has the BEST PULLED PORK sandwich in Phoenix and maybe even the best in the entire Universe!!  Sure their might be a few other places that have better BBQ Ribs, Brisket and/or Smoked Sausages, but Pork on a Fork is as good or better than most at these and the are the BEST at Pulled Pork!    You can not beat their Pulled Pork Sandwich, which is HUMONGOUS~ almost enough for two people!  It's so moist, tender and with a nice aroma of smokiness you'll want it for for yourself! It comes with two sides.  I recommend their tasty seasoned waffle fries and their BBQ Beans!  These BBQ Beans are cooked in Heaven ~ sent by angels down to earth and given to Pork on a Fork to sell to their customers!  :^)  Well, maybe that's a stretch but their BBQ Beans are soooo tasty full of bacon and brisket burnt ends with a great balance of seasoning.   If you have tried Pork on the Fork yet, you don't know what you're missing.  Once you've tried them for lunch, you'll find yourself wanting more and caan't wait for your next visit!  I hope to see you there."}
{"text":"Been going here for about 6 months now and was not real excited at first but the food kept getting better.   Try the brisket plate or pork sandwich, am sure you will be pleased!  Also they have \"Prime Rib Fridays\" and its very good as well!   Also they have a LARGE room in back for groups or extra people and a big screen TV for games and such!"}
{"text":"Went in on the 5th around 4:00 pm.  I know it is a new location but the service was awful!  The lady at the register was rude to us & told us we had to order before we get to the register.  Went back to the food line to order & after waiting a few minutes with 4 employees ignoring us my husband asked if this is where we were to order.  We were told yes and were continued to be ignored.  We waited a while longer and our order was finally taken.  We get to the register to pay & they give our food to the lady in front of us.  We told them it was our order and not hers and they argued with us and told us that she ordered online so she gets her order first.  We argued again that it shouldn't matter - that was our order (not even the same thing she ordered) & they bagged it up for her anyway.  The lady at the register asked if it was our order and we said yes, but that is fine, we can order it again.  Then they pulled her order out of her bag and gave it to us where we again argued that it was her order and she had our order.  The manager lady did look very busy trying to train everyone but there was only one person in front of us.  There was no way the service should have been this bad.  My husband said the brisket was not good - I had the pork sandwich and it was ok.  They were out of cornbread so we had mac & cheese - nothing special & my son wouldn't even eat his.  Not sure we will be back after the service as there are a lot of other better BBQ joints around but the price was good and they are close so we may give them one more chance once they are open for a while.  Hopefully I will be able to update with more stars."}
{"text":"I finally was able to try this place!!! My sister got me sausage and brisket with Mac n cheese.. so delicious. Prices are affordable, and food is filling. I can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Casual joint with incredibly good food!  Their ribs are my favorite EVER.  The meat is so tender and flavorful that I hardly use any sauce.  In fact, I appreciate how they don't drown their meat in sauce, but give you the option to slather it on or not.  Brisket is good too.  It's hard to find a place that does brisket well and doesn't smother it in sauce, but POAF gets it right.  Sides are decent.  We like the mac n cheese, potato salad, and mac salad.  My husband loves their pulled pork.  He's from Syracuse, NY, where the delicious Dinosaur BBQ is king....but has recently admitted that POAF pulled pork is superior.  How's that for a recommendation?!?!  (Note:  He prefers Dinosaur BBQ sauce over POAF's sauce.)  Self-serve drinks.  Counter service.  They changed the ordering set up so it's now almost cafeteria-line style, and you walk down the line.  It seemed to expedite the food prep.  Our plates were ready right after we paid, and we walked to table food-in-hand.  I do wish there had been a tray to make carrying the food plates easier.  (although it's possible there were trays that I didn't see??)  Last time I was there, they ran food to the table.  Not sure if this depends on how busy it is.  Takeout entrance is around the corner.  Bottom line: Great food.  Our fave BBQ."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Pork on a Fork when I attended the Best of the Biltmore event this year.  (Or was it Best of New Times?)   Oh, well.   Best of something event.  I LOVE smoked meat -- as long as it's melt in one's mouth tender and has a very smokey flavor, and the BBQ sauce has a zingy taste.   And this place fits the bill.   After going back numerous times to the booth during the event, I decided to check out the store -- especially since they gave us a coupon for buying something and getting something off.  I got the pulled pork, the links, and a bottle of hot BBQ sauce, all of it to go.   I must admit, I didn't quite make it out of the store without sampling some of the pork and links.   I wanted to see if one of the other four BBQ flavors they had on the table was something I should buy.   Nope.   The hot BBQ sauce was the best.    As far as I'm concerned, I don't think the meat really needs to have the sauce.   I eat it plain or added to whatever dish I feel in the mood.     I've continued to go back.   Buying a pound of the pork actually goes a long ways.   I've also tried their mac and cheese, but I wasn't particularly impressed."}
{"text":"Took my whole family here on a Saturday afternoon. The Food was cold, really dry. Seemed to be prepared days before. Ribs were way overcooked. Dining area was not clean and there were no customers at the time of my visit, so busy is not an excuse. Poor selection of fountain beverages. NO corn on the cob! Yep, that's right a bar B que restaurant  with no corn on the cob!"}
{"text":"So I've been a customer of pork on a fork for 2 years now.  I always get pulledpork, mac n cheese and beans.  I'm from Kansas City and love BBQ.  The last two visits here I've noticed they have completely changed the BBQ beans(my favorite).  The new beans suck.  So much I think I stop supporting pork on a fork.  I just so happen to wearing a pork on a fork shirt while writing this review.  I gave the place a 3 star because I do like the atmosphere and all of the workers are very pleasant.  But I don't get why u would change something that's soo good.  Are you going to change the rub on the meat now???   If it's not broke don't fix or ruin it in this case.  Hope u bring back the beans but from here on out I will not be eating here."}
{"text":"This review is based on the pork products I picked up at the Mesa Farmers Market.  I understand they have a restaurant opening soon, and I'll for sure have to check it out.  For $12 you get a bag of frozen smoked pulled pork that is so easy to fix at home!  Just put it in a pan - I added a little (very little) of my favorite bbq sauce - and heat until hot.  Great smoke flavor, no fatty pieces and very tender.  The pulled pork is as good as any I've had from a bbq place here or anywhere.  I also tried the ham steaks and they were tasty, not fatty and much better than any ham steak I've bought at the grocery store.    I'm a repeat customer and that says it all!"}
{"text":"Good but certainly not the best in the valley (that title IMHO goes to Naked, hands down). The sausage was the tastiest followed by the pulled chicken then the brisket. All could be helped by some BBQ sauce (several varieties available) and the pulled pork almost REQUIRED it. The meats overall were pretty average. The sides were the standout however. The mac and cheese was addictively delicious. The potato salad and cornbread (the latter of which really shouldn't count as a side) were also very good."}
{"text":"Ok...so after a few minutes of trying to find this place, we stepped into heaven.  There is no lighted sign or really any lights outside to tell you where it is, but we found it.  We walked in to a very busy place.  The bff and I stood there trying to figure out what we wanted and couldn't decide.  We thought we had figured it all out when we decided one of us would get the pulled pork sandwich and the other would get the brisket...only to find out they were all out of pork!  Must be good and that just means we will have to make the journey out there again!  We each got the brisket and WOW! It was tender and very flavorful.  They have several sauces to choose from.  I went with the mustard bbq and the Crazy (something or other...I can't remember the name).  The mustard bbq sauce was perfect for the brisket.  Just the right amount of tang and spice.  For my two sides I chose the mac n cheese and waffle fries...starch much?  The fries were good and the mac n cheese was really tasty...nothing froo froo or fancy about it.  Just straight up mac n cheese!   The menu isn't huge, but the smell is intoxicating enough to lead you to confusion that will mess with you and your decision making abilities!    I didn't mean to be a nosey-rosey but I did look at other patrons' plates and everything in the place looks delicious...the ribs, the chicken...I can't wait to go back and try some more!  Thanks to Yelp, I got a free drink!  Oh and as for the name...when I was finished with my meal, you could have put a fork in me and I would have been \"pork on a fork!\"  I don't regret it and don't judge me...it's the holidays! Screw the diets!"}
{"text":"We down right ordered the family XL meal. Outstanding!! 6 adults 2 kids. One extra side because we are undecisive folk.  Again outstanding.  *Only thing to watch for is ribs although tasty are fatty."}
{"text":"its hard to give 3 stars sin e i think its a 2 1/2 place but rouding up.  i compare all bbq against my home state of tennessee.  i got the original sampler platter  chicken - actually moist and pretty decent sausage - pretty good. pulled pork - not bad but doeant hold a candle to tennessee pulled port beans - nasty one of the worst ive ever had mac salad - decent rendition  all in all not the worst place for bbq in arizona but not great.    ps your bbq sauces need major work.  could you introduce on with actual spice?  or a vinegar based sauce?"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! If you're not paying attention you can easily miss this spot because it's in a commercial building, but don't let that fool you this place is great. Walking in and just smelling the food lets you know that this place is legit.  This was my first time here and I came based on the suggestions of my fellow Yelpers. Prior to ordering my food I checked in and was given a free drink just for checking in. Not sure if that is an all the time thing, but it let you know that they care about their customers.  I ordered the pull pork sandwich with a side of waffle fries. The sandwich was excellent and the pork was moist and seasoned perfectly to allow the flavor of the meat to shine. The fries were just as good and I was happy with my choice. Plus you couldn't beat the price for the quality of food...just $9.  This place was clean inside and the staff was friendly. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times now, twice for lunch and twice for dinner.   I've had the pulled pork with beans and Mac and cheese each time for lunch. Pork is incredibly tender and juicy. It doesn't come with sauce, but there's a handful of different choices to add to the sandwich. Beans are excellent.  First time we came for dinner, they were out of chicken. My wife not being a BBQ person wasn't feeling trying something, so unfortunately we left. The 2nd time for dinner she ordered the chicken sandwich and I went for the ribs. As my ribs were ready, they leaned over the counted and told us they were out of chicken!  We've already paid at this point, so no where to go.  They offered to make her a cold chicken salad, which she said was good. My ribs were good, great flavor but didn't pull away from the bone like in would have expected. I'll probably go back to the pulled pork and try the beef next time though.   As we left, no offer to comp the salad or any effort to make up for her not getting what she ordered.  Great food, disappointing in the service and fulfillment side though."}
{"text":"Awesome! I'd never seen this place before, but we went with friends. Some of the best BBQ I've ever had. We had a restaurant.com gift certificate so ordered a ton of food since we had to hit $35 with just 2 of us. Pretty much everything we ordered was good except a few things that I didn't like but my hubby did. The baked beans had awesome flavor but were a bit spicy for me. The ribs were out of this world- perfectly done and great flavor. Same for the pulled pork, waffle fries, sweet potato fries, and cornbread muffins. The BBQ sauces were a perfect compliment to the foods- I loved the tangy flavors and hubby liked the mustard and spicy sauces.  They were all out of beef brisket and mac and cheese, but we'll definitely try those next time. I also wanted to try the grilled ham and cheese sandwich, but we were already well beyond stuffed full. Prices here are really reasonable, and the portions are generous without being overwhelming."}
{"text":"Blasted into town for a business day trip at the Deer Valley Airport, checked Yelp for nearby lunch options, this place looked good, had lots of positive reviews, and was close, and man were we happy we did!   Checked in, so we got the free pork slider, had the pulled pork sandwich combo and the beef brisket combo, both with sweet potato fries and beans.  The food was fantastic and quite filling, and the 3 different BBQ sauces available were delicious with just the right amount of kick.  This is a great place to eat if your in the area"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try a new place for lunch. I found this place on yelp. We arrived and the place was not busy. It was pretty dark inside but we were getting ours to go. Even if we wanted to stay there are only two tables from what I saw. I ordered the 4 sample plate and sides my husband ordered the half a rack of ribs and sides. We were pretty disappointed in the amount of food or lack their of. One sausage. A scoop of pork. A half a scoop or chicken and barely two slices of brisket. My husband and I wanted to share this and ribs and that was a challenge since it was basically for one person. We have gone to other bbq establishments around the valley who gave more meat in their portions. The meats were good and juicy. My husband did say the ribs were slightly tough. The sides- he had baked beans and loved them. I had mac and cheese which was great and the waffle fries which seemed to be full of oil and undercooked. Their sauce is amazing I will say that much but otherwise it's basic bbq."}
{"text":"Good food but poor service. I stood at the counter for several minutes just waiting for someone to take my order. I was surprised the credit card tried to give the person ringing up the order a tip. Why do I need to tip if I have to wait in line to order, then pick up my food at the counter when it is ready and throw it away when I'm done?  Why not just have a touch screen we can order from?"}
{"text":"Ummmm, YUUUUM. Like, drooling yum. And dangit, this is a dangerous location. Right next to the frys I go to at least once a week. Im in trouble. SO good. Went here for the first time this past weekend, did the chicken sandwich with sides of potato salad and baked beans. I apparently missed the memo that the mac and cheese is to die for, so now I must return just for that! Not the cheapest, but I suppose same price range as somewhere such as chipotle. Not fast food, but not a full on site down fancy restaurant. Meat was very good. Wasn't a huge fan of the potato salad, not sure what it was about it. Not terrible, but will not get it again. Cute décor, friendly staff, and a little too good of a location. I shall return."}
{"text":"There are many places in Phoenix to go to for so-so BBQ, but there aren't that many that are as memorable ... and delicious!... as Pork on a Fork. This place is inconspicuously tucked away from the road near Deer Valley airport, with a sign that says, \"Valley's Best BBQ\" and an arrow directing traffic. Well, that is an understatement! The first time my boyfriend and I stopped in, we were warmly greeted by the staff. We chose our entree and sides (he got the beef brisket and I got the chicken ... and we both got macaroni salad -yum!) and took our plates to the back, where it opens up to a clean, brightly-colored room. From there, we had an assortment of BBQ sauces to choose from. (My personal favorite is the Sweet and Mild.) Since then, we've been back several times and now go at least once a week. We're so appreciative that this little gem is near our house...it's not only the best BBQ in north Phoenix, but possibly the Southwest. The meat is smoked, juicy and absolutely mouth-watering. The price is right, and the employees are friendly and accommodating. If you like good BBQ...and not the mediocre kind served by most chains around town...try Pork on a Fork...you won't just like it...you will LOVE it!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ! The atmosphere is laid-back and comfortable. Awesome lunch spot!"}
{"text":"The smoked brisket was amazing. The char was so tasty! Generous portions and nice variety with really good pricing. The sauce was flavorful and zesty. The coleslaw was fresh! Pulled pork sandwich was huge and enough for two meals. I wanted a salad but they ran out of lettuce. Next time. I would definitely go back! People friendly too! Good spot."}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting better! The portion of meat is perfect. My wife and I got the 3 meat platter and both had enough leftover for lunch the next day. The only somewhat negative thing about this place is the small sides."}
{"text":"Good food, surprisingly dirty tables on a slow Tuesday night."}
{"text":"The staff was kind and food served quickly.  Quirky location in a concrete tilt up building.  Not a complaint - just an observation.  Several sauces are available for you  - try 'em!  Will return for sure."}
{"text":"This is very good BBQ; not the best I've had, but certainly one of the best.  The service was quick and friendly (you order at the counter).  Prices are about typical.  The \"restaurant\" is a simple arrangement in an industrial complex.  Don't expect ambiance here, it's just a place to eat really good BBQ.  They have a good assortment of tasty BBQ sauces at each table.  Try them all!"}
{"text":"I've since been back multiple times and have been happy each time. Love their BBQ burrito and their waffle fries."}
{"text":"Yum! I am not a huge BBQ person but this place is fantastic. We have been here several times and tried everything but the shining star is obviously the babyback ribs. So stinkin' good. If you like ribs and have to share, go ahead and order a full rack. I also really enjoy their sides. The waffle fries are great but if you are taking them home, make sure to tear a whole in that foam container so they don't get all soggified. But if that happens, go ahead and pop them in the toaster oven for a few, voila! I love their mac and cheese, its so good and cheesy! The hubs loves their baked beans because they have chunks of meat in them. Their side BBQ sauces are great! They just overall have great food. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Pork on a Fork is an unexpected awesome BBQ place in the north valley.  If you're from Nebraska like me you may appreciate the Cornhuskers \"N\" on the smoker and picture of windmills & farmers in the dining area.  To me, those are a few of the reasons why I left that terrible place.  No points lost though.  I have only been here during lunch and they usually have a line at the door, come early.  Their brisket, BBQ pork, beans and waffle fries are hot, tasty and fresh. PoaF's meat is awesome. The cornbread is good too. The portions are big too, I typically have to fight the afternoon food coma but it's worth it.  Their sauces aren't anything fantastic, but I enjoy the spicy sauce. The dining areas have flat screen TV's and aren't bad, but the chairs and tables are picnic quality."}
{"text":"My youngest step son requested ribs for his birthday dinner and we were out by Tom's thumb, but they ribs weren't out of the smoker for another two hours, so we headed back to our side of town, and went to POAF instead.  I really appreciated the super nice customer service.  I didn't enjoy the food very much though.  The mac and cheese was the best part, it really was super yummy, but the meats were cold and the ribs were dry.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back, but I can't call this my fav BBQ spot..."}
{"text":"Pork on a fork catered an event at my wife's work recently, and the food was pretty good. The pulled pork was flavorful and their hot bbq was really good. The beans were tasty and had a little heat to them. The brownies were ok, but not amazing, and the mac and cheese was a little bland. I give a little more leeway for catering, so overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Great BBQ in Phoenix! Hard to find though, it's in a commercial complex don't worry you didn't drive by it, it's there and worth the couple of u-turns you'll have to pull to find it. Food came out fast and the sauces were dynamite."}
{"text":"Stopped in there this morning with the idea of getting some more sausage gravy on biscuits which I thought were really good the first time I had them.  It appears the week after my last breakfast there they stopped serving breakfast and now open at 10 instead of 8.  I had even brought my cooler with me in case they had bacon in stock.  I am surprised he didn't mention the upcoming change when I asked about being able to pick up some items while I got breakfast.  On my last visit I had their breakfast bowl thing and that was good too.  Now that they are not open early I guess I won't be back because it is out of my way except for early on Thursdays and I don't get around to the farmers markets."}
{"text":"Recently had Pork On A Fork cater a family party.  We had ribs, brisket, and pulled chicken.  Everything was delicious.  Ariana brought everything and set up.  We also got beans, mac and cheese, potato salad and coleslaw.  We decimated the meats.  Everything had a great smoke taste along with 3 choices of BBQ sauce.  Would highly recommend for catering.  Nice job POAF."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! I found this place by using my YELP mobile app searching for nearby places to eat next to my home.  I had NO idea this hidden gem was literally a few miles up the road from me across from Deer Valley Airport.   It turns out this place has almost a 5 star yelp rating, was featured on Guy Fieri's Diner's, Drive-In, & Dives (love me some Triple D!), AND has a $20 for $10 GROUPON!!!   So, my date and I decided to check it out for the first time this past Friday night.  I could smell the bbq before we even pulled in the parking lot.  I had a HUGE smile on my face walking in the doors! The menu is on a flat screen tv in front of the register.  You place your order there rather than sitting at a table and ordering from a server.    We both got the MONSTER which is a sandwich with Beef Brisket and Pork, jalapenos, slaw, pepper jack cheese (I think I got that right).  You pick 2 sides and I chose the mac n cheese and the baked beans.  OMG I am so in love with this food right now! The bbq was simply delicious, the mac n cheese was phenom, and those were the BEST baked beans I have ever eaten in my life.... and I'm a Southern Girl!   I will be back many times... probably later today.  I can't wait to eat my way through the menu.  Thank you YELP!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in around 5-6pm for dinner it was not busy but when we seated with our party of six. The first couple got their orders pretty quick while the rest of us waited and the my boyfriend and I got ours before the couple before us to find out that the staff lost their ordering ticket.   Now For my order. The pulled pork sandwich was perfect not dry and not drenched in sauce, the buns went great with the flavor of the pork and sauce. The Macaroni salad was not that great at all and the cole slaw was bad."}
{"text":"The best bbq I've had in Phoenix.  I had the beef brisket bbq burrito and choose what I wanted in it.  Tons of choices, I had pickles, coleslaw, and others I can't remember.  Then I got to choose two sides, I had the beans and coleslaw.  The beans were delicious with big chunks of bacon.  The slaw was decent.  Staff is very helpful navigating the menu and how it works.  I can't wait to try something new the next time!"}
{"text":"This is EXCELLENT!!!! I love BBQ and am I blown away by how good it was.  I never heard of it and will be back VERY soon.  My boys loved everything.  The BBQ burrito was amazing and the BBQ sauce even better.  I would cater from here in a hot minute!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here- when I can actually order it. 3 of my last 4 visits have been horrendous. I have let management know the disappointment, and yet nothing has changed. The good experience I had of those 4 was when I ordered take out online and then picked it up. My card was charged 3 times, and I had $90.00 pending on it for 4 days, and that was STILL better than trying to dine in. There is absolutely no customer service. The employees that work here could not care less that they are at work, and it shows. Two nights ago (Thurs)- I walk in at 7:35, they close at 8:00, I do not think that is unreasonable for me to want food and service. I stand at the \"Order Here\" counter for about two minutes- and I can not see a single worker. I can hear them, all talking and laughing behind the kitchen equipment. Finally someone comes up and says \"Do you need something?\". Well I would like to order some food, he replies \"Takeout Order\" and I said \"no\". He said he would have to find someone to help me. Now three more employees come around the corner, laughing and joking with what I can only assume are their friends, and then 4 more employees appear from behind the equipment. So now I have 8 employees standing around in my view, but still NONE of them can \"help me\". Finally a 9th employee comes up, and puts gloves on and asks me what I want. I ordered brisket. He opens the drawer, makes a face, calls someone else over to look at it, she made a disgusted face and then whispers to him \"We can't serve that to people, just tell her we are out.\" I can totally hear them mind you. So then he just looks at me and says...\"ummmm, yea, so we are out of brisket- sorry.\" I was pretty pissed so I just walked out. Seriously Pork on a Fork- get your act together. You all have great food and not a lot of competition- this does not give you the right to treat your customers like crap and not prepare food. This was the better experience of my bad ones... but you can see why I am close to giving up on you all. I have reached out to management before and not received a response. Maybe a Yelp review will actually get their attention. I would rather drive 15 miles farther just because of the service, which is what I did Thursday night. Get it together! Customer Service goes a long way- these employees could really embrace that concept."}
{"text":"Generous portions of smoked meat. Tender and juicy! The Mac n chess's side was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, all the meat is excellent. Brisket is my favorite. A bit strange that they don't include a bread or cornbread, apparently it's a side, potato salad not that great. Customer service is hit or miss. Very strange that they weigh the meat. Great food though!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ and it's just up the street from my house! The staff is pretty amazing and helpful as well. I always get the food to go and they are pretty quick with the food prep. Gotta love the small local business!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place but it's taken a nose dive in quality.   Came here for lunch and it was almost completely empty. The food quality has decreased drastically. The meat was dry and cold. The sides were cold. Everything was just weak.   The food was really just awful....after a dozen visits we'll probably never come back."}
{"text":"This place is just around the corner from my house. so I thought I would try it. I have been there twice and I am done... I will admit that I am not a big fan of smoked meats but thought I would see what the fuss was all about. the first time I got the Burrito/Wrap and after spending $10 I was presented with something that I would be embarrassed to serve. the Burrito had a small amount of brisket and they were out of Black  Beans so I go about a tablespoon . this Burrito was small and not worth the price. The sides I got were the Cole slaw and waffle fries. they were both good.  The smoked meat was good however the smoke lasted all day and in to the evening where I was then forced to eat a few TUMS.  so why go back ... Well I thought  since they just opened I would give them another chance. I went back with some co-workers and got the meat sampler with a drink for $13.   it is very small location and they have a few tables inside so we HAD  to take it to go. When I opened the container this was definitely a sampler as there was a small amount of brisket of which a Hugh piece of fat (I refuse to eat a chuck of fat) resided on. There was half of sausage link and a small pile of pulled pork. the brisket and pork were put on 2 small slider buns. also I did not realize that they had all the different BBQ sauces and they didn't even offer or tell me to get some when they handed me my order so when I eat this I had no sauce to combine with.  for the sides this time I got the sweet potato fries and the Cole slaw. I liked the fries.  I have to say that all the meats tasted the same. The smoke flavor to me was so overpowering that the only way to know what you're eating if you close your eyes is by the texture of the meat. I probably don't need to add that once again I ran for the TUMS that evening. Also I pulled the fat off with a fork in one hand and my fingers on my other. The smell of smoke permeated my fingers and it took all day to get rid of that smoke.    My feeling is that the portions were not worth the price I paid both in money and indigestion.  overall I realize that I can't do the smoked meats any more as I get older. I am sure there are lots of people who will love and enjoy this place just remember your pepsid or Tums."}
{"text":"This will be my first review for this place.  I didn't get to go to the actual restaurant.  I found it insanely weird that a restaurant wasn't open on the weekends.  I am assuming that the area over in Deer Valley just doesn't get busy on the weekends?  So we arrived at their restaurant and they had a sign on the door saying they are closed and will be at a farmers market.  So I found out which market and had to drive 20 minutes south.  The booth didn't have a sign on it big enough to see it and we walked by it and had to walk around again.  I am pretty sure we looked like lost tourists!  Sad.  We ordered the one thing they had, a pork sandwich.. it was SOOOOOO good!  The pork melted in my mouth and the bbq sauce was perfectly spicy and complimented the sandwich so wonderfully!  My taste buds were thanking me.  It was amazing and it wasn't even hot (heat) and I ate it at a farmers market.  That says something!  So we will be making another trip to their actual restaurant soon so we can get a real experience.  I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Easily the best BBQ in the valley and possibly the best in the southwest.  The staff is terrible - slow, cares very little about the fact they move like sloths, and not a smile in the place (we went on a weekend).  The food is otherworldly. The bark and smoky flavor to the THICK slices of brisket are done right. The sauces are fantastic. The mustard base BBQ sauce was one of the most unique flavors I've ever had works well on everything. The Mac and Cheese is up there with the best, as well are the beans. The potato salad left a lot to be desired.   Even with a terrible ordering and purchasing experience, I have to give this place 5 stars. The food is that good. AND they have RC Cola on fountain!"}
{"text":"I used to think Pork on a Fork was one of the best BBQ joints around.  Our last two visits have disproved this theory.  We used a Groupon here a week ago and it was not tasty like it used to be.  I had a bone in my pulled pork sandwich that was about the size of a quarter and could have broken one of my teeth in two.  I realize that there is always the possibility of bone in BBQ, but this piece was so large they should have caught it.  The meat really didn't have any flavor without the sauce.  My husband was not thrilled by the lukewarm beer he was given or the brisket.  The amount of flies in the dining area was disgusting!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to find this little gem as we've not had any good BBQ in Phoenix.   The friendly staff hand shredded our pork sammies and served them with delicious Mac and cheese and baked beans. All were delicious options.  We also ordered cole slaw and it was not zingy.   They have ample other side options and the traditional BBQ meat options including brisket and sausage.   Will definitely add this place to our must haves list."}
{"text":"We ordered take out here last night. My husband got the sampler and I got the brisket. All of the meats were over cooked and extremely dry. The sauces weren't to great either. It's so hard finding a good BBQ restaurant here in az. Ricks smokehouse down the way was even better then this. How it won az best who knows?"}
{"text":"It smells fantastic when you walk in but that was the only good thing about the place. The service is terrible. I had to ask for sauce for my bbq bowl 3 times, finally getting it after my entire order was bagged up. I watched a server sweeping scraps of meat onto the floor behind the counter. No one seems to know how to do their job.   If the food was good, I might consider going back but I found it fairly bland. It certainly wasn't good enough to make up for the horrible customer service. You lost me as a customer after my very first visit."}
{"text":"We got there at closing time so take out was our choice. We got platters - 3 or 4 meats with 2 sides. Brisket was good but dry-ish. The pulled chicken was delish. Good sausage, full of spice and juicy. We tried baked beans, Cole slaw, corn off the cob. A generic dinner roll is invluded. No butter or anything. It was ok. The Cole Slaw was juicy and crunchy fresh. We were offered s variety of sauces which highlights the flavor of the bbq. Good value, great flavor. I should ordered some ribs but there was more than I good finish as is."}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews on yelp so since I work very close by I thought I would try it.   First impression.. This place is situated in an industrial park and probably caters mainly to the businesses nearby.. I dropped in around 4..was pretty empty since they tend to get a busy lunch crowd.   Staff was super friendly and knew the food.. I tried the Midwest special which was a mix of 3 types of slow cooked meat topped with coleslaw and jalapeños.    Food was fresh and delicious, got potato salad and macaroni salad as sides and were super tasty as well.  Great little down home bbq restaurant.. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Best pulled pork ever. The ribs werre done to perfection. The sides were not an after thought . Beans were seasoned just right and the cheese and mac, creamy deliciousness."}
{"text":"Great little BBQ joint right near Deer Valley Airport. We just happen to be driving in the area (avoiding the freeway traffic) and got a little hungry. Stumbled upon this spot and we are glad that we did. The wife loved it, as did I. We will be stopping by much more in the future!"}
{"text":"Ordered catering for a company lunch. Justin showed up 10 minutes early which was greatly appreciated, not to mention he was very friendly. The food was packaged well and came with all the utensils we needed. Ordered the two meat option from the catering menu - pulled pork, pulled chicken and two sides, mac and cheese and coleslaw. Came with three types of BBQ sauce. Everything was delicious - it was a big hit in the office and a welcome break from the typical sandwich platters. Would most definitely recommend Pork on a Fork and will be using for future lunches! (Side note: order extra mac n' cheese because it is amazing and will disappear quickly!)"}
{"text":"Had my first Pork on a Fork experience last night and it was amazing! I had the pulled pork with the sweet potato fries and it was delicious. The pork was moist and flavorful and the fries were awesome.  This place has found something the Valley is missing... Great BBQ! I haven't had BBQ this great since I left the Midwest 10 years ago.  Looking forward to going back and trying some of the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Used to love this place! Now the long lines are a bust. Waited 30 plus minutes to get o the front to see someone has a take out which only makes people in line wait longer. Not a fan of the new ordering system or watching people handle your food. Probably best  to have a second station during peak periods in order to cut time down. Most people have a quick lunch. Food is great, but sometime not worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Jesus, I don't even know where to begin. The most deelish bbq west of Memphis. Quality and quantity above all else. Next time I go to Phoenix I will move next to this place."}
{"text":"Definitely a diamond in the rough. I could probably eat here every day. I already have  my next choice picked out. Definitely a go-to place"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, I was craving bbq and this was the closest place to me. I saw that they had 4 stars, so I figured it would be good. I was really dissatisfied, the brisket was dry and the pulled pork had almost no flavor. Their sides are subpar and the baked beans taste like it came from the can and heated. If your looking for good bbq try little miss bbq or naked bbq."}
{"text":"I was raised on southern pit Bar-B-Q.  As a displaced Texan, I'm still searching for a good meal.  Heard Pork on a Fork was pretty good so I hunted them down one evening.  You will need a good GPS to find the location in an industrial strip center near Deer Valley airport.  They serve real smoked Bar-B-Q which is better than many local BBQ joints.  You can see the smoke ring on the brisket without needing a magnifier.  But, it falls far short of the perfect BBQ from south Texas.  Only 12 hours in a slow smoker produces brisket that meets the back home standard.    Pretty good Bar-B-Q.  I'm still looking for awesome."}
{"text":"Good eats... Food was solid... Great selections on plates and platters.. Sides are awesome and not a bad price on getting a good amount of food."}
{"text":"In town for work and thought we'd try it out based on the name alone! It did NOT disappoint! Great food, nice atmosphere, and helpful employees. I would definitely come back and recommend this to anyone who hasn't tried it!! Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"This Kansas girl is always on the lookout for quality bbq and Pork on a Fork did not disappoint. The key to identifying a good bbq joint is their brisket. Theirs was perfectly smoked, great smoke ring just enough fat remaining to seal in the juices. The sausage chicken and pulled pork was just as perfect. Finally if you are a sauce person definitely try what they have to offer. Now what about the sides? Those too were made to perfection, don't miss the Mac and cheese and when they ask if you want seasoning on it say YES. If you are anywhere near one of their locations in Phoenix stop in!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Everything is good and very difficult to chose. Even the Mac and cheese was delicious. You must get a side of potato salad and the macaroni salad. Be sure to ask for extra bbq sauce. I will definitely be going back for more. My son, who is very picky about his food, even loved the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Hidden inside of several other office building, this location can be easily overlooked.  However, it was obvious from the number of cars at 6 p.m. on a weekday, that this place is a local hot spot despite its hidden venue. There was a visible line of patrons when we pulled up to park, which to us, was a good sign.  We walked in and waited in the line (about 5 groups back from the cashiers) and it took about 15 minutes to reach the front to order. I let the cashier know that we had a Groupon and she asked if we had it ready to go, which we did on the mobile app. She was a touch abrupt with her manner and said that the line was really long and that we should have it ready to keep the wait down. This statement confused me, since I let her know already that we had it out, which we showed her, and we just waited in the line, so we were well aware of the wait...luckily this was the only real sore spot in the whole experience! We will write that off to the hectic wait and that she was pretty obviously stressed about it.  They were out of chicken, so we were offered the brisket as a replacement for no additional charge on the sampler plate. For my sides I had the macaroni salad and the beans, which were both really good. He had the potato salad and beans.    As for the meats, I would have to say that I enjoyed the sausage the most, the pulled pork second, and the brisket the least of the three, although it wasn't bad at all - just placed last in comparison overall! There is a sauce bar so that you can add the BBQ sauce that fits your liking.  The sweet sauce was my pick and it was a good one!  Towards the end of the meal one of the staff stopped by to ask if all had gone well and cleared our plates for us.    Overall: A A hidden local gem that is a must try if you are in the area.  Keep an eye out for Groupon deals!"}
{"text":"O. M. G. I don't know why this place wasn't just overflowing with people. Not enough good things to say about this place. First of all, I live right down the street and I have no idea why it took so long to finally try it out! Amazing amazing amazing food!!! Great prices and definitely not stingy when it comes to serving sizes! They give you so much food! Hubby and I both ate for a little over 20 bucks. Can't beat it!! Especially for bbq. Can't wait to go back and try everything! Definitely bringing all my family and friends too."}
{"text":"Family loved it!  One of our favorite places for barbecue.  The only negative is that it is in a business park.   But if we want good food, go here.    We got the sampler which fed both of us.  We eat less than your average American.  Pork is moist and tender.  The Mac and cheese is killer and the coleslaw is light."}
{"text":"I had their pulled pork with spicy bbq sauce. I was impressed. Probably my favorite bbq place in Phoenix. I didn't give it 5 stars because the place is dirty inside. Flies are EVERYWHERE...Their food is excellent but they really need to clean this place up a bit. I will definitely go back, I can't get enough of that spicy bbq sauce. I'm glad I found this place since it's so close to me :) \"bbq tastes so good it makes you wanna slap your momma\""}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying that this is my first one on Yelp; although I use (and appreciate) reviews on it frequently.  My partner and I eat out several times a week and like to try new places once in a while. We went here on a Sunday night (just got home from eating there) and there was one small family there. The girl who took our order didn't greet us and seemed quite apathetic. My partner has a Groupon, but was unable to download it on his phone. He asked the cashier, who we found out was also the manager, for the WiFi password. She said that the owner has it and she doesn't know it. No apologies, nothing. So my partner made a comment about the fact that she obviously didn't care. So, we figured we'd use the Groupon a next time (see where this is going?). My partner ordered waffle fries as a side. The girl who took our order called back for waffle fries, as none were available.   My cole slaw and mac 'n cheese were pretty good. My pulled pork sandwich was pretty good too, except for the chunk of bone that I bit into. The sandwich was lukewarm at best and a bit on the dry side. But like I said, pretty good. So we were halfway through our meal and still no waffle fries. The acoustics are pretty good in the restaurant and we heard the \"manager\" and the girl who took our order talking about us. They mentioned something about calling the owner regarding the WiFi. My partner went to the counter to inquire about his fries. The girl who took his order asked \"waffle fries or sweet potato fries?\" Umm, she took our order about 15 minutes ago. So no waffles fries were put in the deep fryer. We cancelled the fries, as our meal was almost over.   So, decent food, but horrible service. Oh and there were dirty napkins on the floor and food scraps on some tables - with only a few customers in the place. We'll get a refund on that Groupon and move on..."}
{"text":"Top Notch Bar B Que. Food is very tasty. Great bang for your buck. Plenty of space to relax and enjoy your meal. My second favorite spot for Que."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm giving 5 stars to a BBQ place, but this place is damn good.  I normally don't get excited about BBQ.  I had the pulled pork sandwich, macaroni salad and baked beans.  Everything was excellent, the meat, the sauce, the bun, the mac salad, and definitely the beans.  Seriously, this place was tasty.  It was even reasonably priced.    One guy at my table got this crazy sausage-on-a-bun with pork and sweet potato fires on it.  Seriously, don't eat this on a first date, but it looked like an adventure.  His waffle fries looked great, too.  To finish things off, I left my cellphone on the table and the girl behind the counter chased me down in the parking lot and gave it to me.  I'm excited to try something else, but I wouldn't be surprised if my usual order is exactly what I had today."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. They always use gloves when touching any food. Get the sweet potato fries and beans as a side. They go great together."}
{"text":"Great BBQ!  This place is easy to miss, as it is in an odd location. But it's worth the search. Some coworkers told me about this place and I love it now.   Pork, brisket, bbq baked beans, and cornbread muffins. All just amazing.   You can also get \"gift certificates\" (they work more like coupons really) on Restaurant.com for POAF that can take a healthy 30% off your total experience after everything is said and done (make sure you find a coupon code before buying the certificate though, there is always a promo code, just use google)  I would have to recommend taking a big party and getting the family feast deal, it's $89.99 but it feeds 8 no problem.  I will definitely be returning, if I had any complaint it would be that they close way too early. But I'm sure that has to do with their location. If they opened a new, larger place and began serving beer, they would get that 5th star from be in a heartbeat.  But still, great work!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ place I've been to in town.  Great sauces and huge portions.  Check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"First time there and enjoyed the food immensely. Had the brisket plate at lunch and the place was packed. Lots of local workers come her to grab a quick lunch and they were in and out in a matter of minutes. The brisket plate was delicious and I had cole slaw with macaroni salad. Both sides were very fresh and good eats. My husband had the cornbread which was excellent in the muffin form. Great portions, good selections, and excellent food. Their sauces are delicious as well. Highly recommend this BBQ joint for everyone."}
{"text":"For some reason honey loves this place. We always get the beef brisket sandwich and share the big boy sampler. I like their honey mustard bbq flavored sauce."}
{"text":"Hidden gem, so not sure I want to share how yummy this food was, they also have different sauces on the table that you can try. I had chicken bowl and chilli cheese fries. Coleslaw was good. They have home made cornbread that is a must try. Some of the kids had the pulled apart pork and others tried the beef... all were satisfied. We stopped in to celebrate my son enlisting in the US Navy."}
{"text":"Bbq and beer!!!  The brisket was amazing and definitely try the mustard sauce.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Although this place came highly recommended from my sister, I was pretty  disappointed. We placed a take out order for a family meal to be picked up 45 minutes later. I arrived at the pickup time and had to wait 20 minutes for the food because of understaffing. The meats were all dry without BBQ sauce and there was no BBQ sauce in an extra container. The sausage was tasty, but slightly burnt. As for the sides, the pork-n-beans were good, the Mac-n-cheese average and the side salad fresh but very small. Pretty disappointing overall, but I guess Phoenix isn't really known for BBQ."}
{"text":"Peg and I are always on the lookout for small (as in not a chain of more than a handful) places to eat. Throw in BBQ as a main attraction, and we are ALL in.  Last week, we checked out this place. Almost everytime I go to a BBQ place, I check out the chicken/turkey as you can tell the kind of care that is taken to not overdo. Not only was the chicken wonderfully moist, the pulled pork and brisket was VERY good. A choice of sauces tableside complemented the meal. Side dishes, which have a tendency to be relegated to second class in a lot of BBQ places, were equally tasty and didn't taste like a #10 can of anything. The beans were well simmered with chunks of brisket and the potatoes were roasted and flavorfully seasoned. We would recommend highly...and will be back!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious each time we go! Beans and Mac n cheese are amazing and the staff are happy and friendly"}
{"text":"So Good!  We had our small company Christmas party st the Camelback location and order frequently at the Deer Valley location not only because it is close to home but we also order the Family style and deliver it businesses as a thank you for their business   Great quality, my wife's favorite is the brisket  and I love the ribs!"}
{"text":"Tried it Tonight with the family in N Phx location- Picked Up and took home- DELISH!!!  Will be at Camelback location on Friday- awesome!"}
{"text":"Ate here tonight because we were shopping at the RV dealer.  It's our second time.  The line was very long and we waited a very long time to order.  However, the prep guy was very friendly, apologizing for the wait and trying to make the best of it.  It was also super hot in the line, we were hot and hungry standing there.  I ordered a half pound of chicken and added pickles and jalepenos on it with mac and cheese salad and potato salad.  Everything tasted great.  The side salads were really really good and the chicken, although the bone/connector joint thingys kept getting in my way, the sauces kept me happy.  All of the sauces made the chicken sing harmonies in my mouth.  It was pricey but I had leftovers for later.  Boyfriend got the brisket and raved about it being juicy and delicious.  My only complaint is the wait in line.  They need more help."}
{"text":"The first time I went, the service and the bbq was awesome!! I went again last night, and the bbq was very good, however, the service was terrible. I guess you need to go before 4pm. I arrived there at 6:15pm and was treated like I was a being an inconvenience for ordering food. The sides are good, but to small especially for a rack of ribs. I also would prefer to be able to order pulled pork, or smoked sausage without a bun or in a sandwich. I still might go back for the great food, but I am very disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"We were craving bbq and i wanted to try some place we have never went to. Usually we just go to Bobby-Q. So Pork on a Fork is definitely a hidden gem is you want some bbq that isn't fine dining . It's a hole in the wall spot that seems to be mixed in with some industrial buildings. You will pass this place if you don't look for the sign that says \"bbq\".  Now what can I say about this bbq spot. It kind of reminds me of Dickey's bbq but not fast food tasting. Only bc it's a walk up order they put it on a plate for you. This place is actually delicious. The meat super fresh you can tell they take their time with seasoning and cooking. The sides are pretty tasty full of flavor not greasy at all. Super yummy bbq we will totally be back for some more!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ... Was a little skeptical due to the location but this place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Brisket was full of smoke flavor, moist, tender and no sauce needed. The pulled pork was also full of flavor. Mine was a little dry, but my husband said his wasn't and he's a picky BBQ eater being from Texas. I had the beans and coleslaw as my sides and I enjoyed both of them. I wasn't in love with the sauces. I thought they were a little thin. Each sauce had its own distinct flavor. I liked them best when I mixed all three."}
{"text":"It had been awhile since I have been to POAF. I always thought they delivered a good product with friendly consistent service. Unfortunately this is not what we experienced tonight.   When we arrived my wife and I both ordered the same thing, a three meet sampler platter. We were asked what 2 meats we wanted to substitute for brisket. After trying to figure out what they meant and several times being asked the same question we were handed off to another worker. Turns out they were out of chicken and wanted to know what other meet we wanted. Why wouldn't you just say \"we are out of chicken, what would you like to substitute\". This would have been far less confusing. We both chose sausage as our substitute. The help in general seemed like they didn't care and seemed like they were more distracted than focused on helping us.   Then the employee portioned our meat by weighing it. This was different than what I had experienced before. I can understand that it is important to size your portions but does everything need to be weighed. If that is the case then why not just list the item by weight on the menu. I was curious on how much they gave us so I weighed it when I got home on my digital scale. 4.3 oz of pork, 4.5 oz of brisket for me, 4.6 oz of pork, 4.7 oz of brisket for my wife. If your going to weigh out the portion then you should be consistent. Is the goal to just be under 5oz? The 3rd meat was sausage for both of us. I was given a half link while my wife was given a whole one. Again, not being consistent. We both chose mac and cheese for our side which was really good. The portions are smaller now and put in little portable containers for the hot stuff. I was a little disappointed by the size. I got potato salad as the second side and it was good. My wife got the baked beans. These beans should have been called half baked as they were still hard. The flavor was there but definitely under done.   After paying we were asked if we wanted any sauce. We asked for extra BBQ sauce but was told it costs extra. This would have been good to know before paying.   2 sampler plates without drinks cost just over $27. I think this is overpriced for the amount and quality of our food. I try to support local businesses when possible but I'm sorry to say that we could go to a chain restaurant, get better quality, better service and a lower price. I don't think I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"You could do worse for your BBQ fix.  It's a bit pricy for cafeteria style atmosphere. You can expect the staff to screw something up on your order too. The $20/lb. to take some beef brisket home is pretty outrageous."}
{"text":"I've loved Pork On A Fork since the first day I met them at a farmers market.  Their pulled pork & brisket are by far THE BEST anywhere around, and I should know since I am from the midwest where we definitely know BBQ!  I've even got my mother in law hooked & she makes sure to stop by when she is out by their location to get us all some delicious food!"}
{"text":"Today I went to Pork On A Fork and ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich, I got no bun with the (dry) meat they provided. My friend ordered the Monster and no coleslaw on the side, jalapenos were supposed to be on the side and was not either. So I called and complained about the services I had. Jaden said he would talk to the manager and see what can happen, he called back about 25 mins later and just offered me 10% off? We got a better discount with AAA! This is not except-able, I have been in Customer Service over 10 years!!! I will NOT be returning to this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place based off a friend's recommendation. It was ok the meat had some pretty good smoke flavor. The Mac and cheese was also ok it had sat out a little too long and was dry. The cornbread was BURNED literally took it out of wrapper and it crumbled because it was SO dry. If I went back it would be to eat the meat and the meat only."}
{"text":"\"no question best BBQ in valley. try the Midwestern monster, yummy in my tummy.\""}
{"text":"So the food had gone down since I was there last but I thought that maybe it was just an off day so I went back Monday 12/21 and waited in line for 15 mins when I got to order I was told they were out of brisket pork and ribs so all they had was chicken and hot links. I left with nothing. I tried again tonight waited in line again and was told when I ordered ribs they were out. Same story as Monday some surprise order came in. I walked out and won't be back. As someone who is in customer service you really should put a sign out of what is out so people don't waste their time and can go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Excellent pulled pork! And the sauce was wonderful. Really yummy waffle fries.  Other than needing more seating ( which I understand they are fixing by expansion) this was a go back to place. Unfortunately we were just visiting from South Florida, too far for takeout!"}
{"text":"This is the place for real BBQ....no nonsense, quality meats, and a slow staff that tells you nothing here is rushed!  Their brisquet is perfect, and the choice of sauces keeps your taste buds dancing from meat to meat!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Highly recommend sides are very good."}
{"text":"After reading reviews I checked them out.  Very good smoked pork. I could see a clean smoke ring in the meat. It was moist and eXtremely flavorful.  I will return again for sure!"}
{"text":"All was dry and too heavily salted.   Sides lacked much flavor. We're glad we tried it but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the food at Pork on a Fork.  The only downside is that there is limited dining area and the line to order can be long."}
{"text":"I've had lunch here three or four times now as it isn't too far from my work. Each time the BBQ has been very good. No issues with dried out meats or burned anything. The pulled pork is tender and flavorful. The shredded chicken is moist and tender. Anyone who has tried to BBQ chicken on the grill knows how tricky it can be to avoid drying it out.  The staff has always been friendly and helpful.  If you are in the area or in the mood for quality BBQ, give Pork On A Fork a try. I'm a fan :)"}
{"text":"Our first time here!  It's my new favorite place for a quick bite!  The flavor in every bite was SO delicious!  I got the bowl with pulled pork, rice, corn, beans, cheese, coleslaw and BBQ sour cream! I wasn't able to eat it all, it was huge!  It was hard to stop though!  SO good!  My husband got the burrito with rice and corn and beans and cornbread on the side. He is a food snob and said it was really good too!"}
{"text":"I really really want to give five stars for POF.  I'm thinking even two is too much because the service was just plain horrible. On the two visits..mind you two days apart because the food is excellent, the service was so awful! No hello when walking in the door, a girl behind the counter was rolling her eyes when I couldn't make up my mind...hey, c'mon, everything looks good, let me have a couple of seconds since I've never been here! Second visit, same greeting..i.e. no hello..okay, ordering my food and I mentioned that we were just here on Thursday and the food was so good we had to come back and got zero response from both people behind counter..I was waiting for a great glad to see you back but I got nothing, nada, zip, no response, not even as much as a smile.  Ok then, wow!  The food was great! Don't expect good service here only good food."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the area!!!! Love it all. We go atleast once a month and its the go to sopt when family comes to town."}
{"text":"The best service. The best food. We'd eat here every day if we could! Our first experience here makes us rave about this restaurant to everyone we know."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Someone told me they had great BBQ, so my family and I decided to pop by on a Sunday afternoon and they were open. Excellent service and amazing BBQ. Everything we had was great!! And we have high expectations for BBQ because we are from Kansas City. Madison was great and very friendly. Highly recommend. They are right by the Deer Valley Airport."}
{"text":"Staff was VERY helpful helping me with my pre ordering questions.  Service was extremely fast.  I had the best baby back ribs ever!"}
{"text":"My husband and fellow yelper bookmarked this hidden gem a few months ago. We were downtown today after a meeting at his office, and he suggested we try Pork on a Fork for a late lunch. I agreed and was not disappointed! I love BBQ, and have been to several BBQ joints, and POF was top notch. When I checked in I received an offer of 25% off!! Awesome!  POF is located in an outdoor mall, I felt it was hard to find, as it was our first time here and the signage was lacking letting us know where to go. After walking a bit, we finally found it. We walked in and was met with hello's and big smiles. After reviewing the menu, which is on a digital board, I decided on a pulled pork sandwich. It came with 2 sides and I chose the mac-n-cheese and waffle fries. The fries were fried fresh upon my order, and were hot, crispy and delicious. The mac-n-cheese was omg yummy. It had just a little kick to it, not overwhelming. My sandwich was okay. Here's where my personal preference comes in, although the pork was tender, I felt it was bland and dry. I put the sweet and mild sauce on, and I had to put a lot on to get it to my preference. The bun was soft and fresh. The restaurant was clean and bright. There are several big screen tv's, and colorful art. The prices were reasonable, and the customer service was good. I am glad we came to POF and I can't wait to go back, especially since my husband has their 25% off check in offer as well :) he saves his for later!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the beef brisket bowl, and totally think the price is worth the meal! I will be coming back here to try other items on the menu! I also liked that they had RC soda, Sunkist and Squirt on their fountain drinks!"}
{"text":"Right near the deer valley airport, in a sort of out of the way location exists some of the best bbq in Arizona. The owners are from Nebraska and having lived there for some years, the decor and pictures of small little farms on the wall was a nice touch. I've literally had everything on the menu and NOTHING has been even remotely disappointing. Smoked to perfection and never dry. All the sides are amazing, especially the waffle fries, baked beans, and Mac and cheese. The bbq burrito was an amazing discovery as well. Can't say enough good things about this place!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Pork on a Fork has really stepped up their game. I had stopped going to their Deer Valley location when other options became available, but gave their new location a shot.  BBQ is going through a bit of a renaissance in the valley and it seems to be pushing everyone to do better. Pork on a Fork's brisket is way better than the last time I had it. This location features a quick, simple menu that gets you in and out quickly. Service is friendly, attentive, and fast.  I can only comment on the sides I've had which are the waffle fries, sweet potato fries, and cornbread muffins--all of which are very good.   Their Brisket sandwich is great and their sausage is a great add on. Good quality BBQ fast. Can't complain about that."}
{"text":"Had a pulled pork sandwich from Pork on a Fork today at the Old Town Farmers Market....very very good! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This is one of the best BBQ restaurants I have eaten  at!! We got the BBQ sampler with all 4 meats. The chicken was so moist. And all the meat had amazing flavor. For our two sides we got mac and cheese and fries. I loved the smokey flavor that the mac and cheese had. And the fries were nice and crispy on the outside. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to Pork on a Fork for the first time the other night.  The barbeque was good, I tried ribs, brisket and sausage.  The sausage was great, not overly dried out like a lot of BBQ places tend to be.  The ribs and brisket were both good, but not the best I've ever had.  Their sauces on the table had a decent variety and I enjoyed the spicy one, although it wasn't very spicy.  I wasn't super impressed with the sides.  The mac and cheese seemed a bit grainy to me.  I would come back because it is so much closer to home than Rudy's or Bobby Q's, but not because the food was any better. Overall I would give it a 3.5."}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab lunch today & picked up the \"Mini Midwest Monster.\" It was absolutely delish! Paired my little Sammie with the BBQ Baked Beans & Potato Salad. It doesn't take much to feel me up, so I am stuffed! I'm originally from the Midwest & know a decent BBQ place. I must say it was not bad at all & I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for Pulled Pork, Brisquit or BBQ Ribs, look no further than Pork On The Fork BBQ.  This place has all the sides (Coleslaw, Beans, Corn Bread and Mac Salad), spicy sauces and offers clean/efficient service."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq best I have had in Arizona! Nice assortment of sauces too. I highly recommend this place. Just jeep in mind it's not a sit down restaurant. It's take out  but there is seating outside."}
{"text":"The menu on this page is not the menu for this location. We were looking forward to waffle fries and chicken tenders but they don't have a fryer. The meat is tough and sides are bland!! Will not be back - very disappointed. If you want bbq, go to little miss bbq!!"}
{"text":"Ron Swanson would approve of this place.  Meat, meat, meat... simple and always cooked perfectly.  For the carnivores in your family take them to this low key, unpretentious barbecue place!"}
{"text":"excellent! went today and had pork, chicken and brisket. VERY good. The side's left something to be desired, the coleslaw and potatoes salad were bland.  The emphasis is clearly on the meat."}
{"text":"I have had BBQ all over the country from Ny to cal from Washington to Florida I can tell u for a fact the people and food at this place are top notch. Everything on the menu is smoked to perfection .The prime rib they serve would cost twice as much any where else and still would not taste as good. I eat there at least twice a week sometimes more ,they greet you with smiles and are always helpful to explain any of the food and let you sample some,Try that any where else ,it will not happen."}
{"text":"Keep coming back to this booth at the Ahwatukee Farmer's Market for more porky goodness! LOVE the $12 bag of pulled pork, had it with their new BBQ sauce, yummy and easily two meals. Have had both the bone-in and boneless chops, equally good. Think I'm leaning towards the boneless only due to my preparation...I butterflied and stuffed them with French bread, sweet onions, garlic, gorgonzola and prosciutto..drool! Check them out, you won't be disappointed! My hubby and I go after our standing Sunday appt with our trainer. Love it because they give you samples, and I'm usually starving by then!!!"}
{"text":"When my husband and I first came across Pork on a Fork's listing we giggled at the name and vowed to try it if only for the name. We found the perfect opportunity to try POAF when LivingSocial featured them as the local daily deal. After leaving Texas 2+ years ago I thought I would never find good bbq again. Thank you, Pork on a Fork for restoring my faith that you don't have to go to a BBQ-infused state to get great BBQ!   We will return time and time again for their amazing sandwiches and the \"f this diet\" waffle fries. It is a bit out of the way for me to drive but I would be a liar if I said it wasn't worth it. I would go so far as to say this has got to be the best BBQ joint in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is SOOO good !! I usually DONT like BBQ but this was good ! I ate everything  on my plate (usually I don't , I pick) .. 4 different sauces to choose from , friendly staff , fast service. I will def be back ! And will recommend to my friends ;)"}
{"text":"Went to POAF, they are a little pricey, but seriously the brisket hit the spot. Nice and smokey, had great flavor (when does a brisket not?), wasn't drenched in sauce. To be honest i could have eaten it without adding any sauce. So delicious. Their sauces are good too.   The line was a little confusing but i figured it out pretty quickly. Get there before 11:45. that is when the rush gets in there."}
{"text":"Really good!! Drove past this place every day and now I'm glad I stopped in. Kids eat free on Mondays!  Delish!!!"}
{"text":"I like Pork on a Fork. While not quite as enthusiastic as others might be, I do feel that in terms of those in need of a quick barbeque fix, they're a respectable option. The best? Not quite - but that's not really a \"knock\" when you look at some of the people they're competing against.  This location in particular, can be easily missed if you're not careful, as it's located in a plaza that's across from the Deer Valley Airport. It's definitely a unique setup, but I feel that it works well with the type of food and environment they're shooting for.  During both visits, my girlfriend and I had their pulled pork sandwich, which is our default choice during barbeque outings. We both agreed that it was decent.  I really like the variety of sauces they have on hand, making certain that you'll find something that \"works\" for your taste buds.  Sadly, I do feel this place suffers from what I find is a recurring issue with most barbeque places in that, while they've mastered the meat, the sides are always hit or miss. Cornbread muffins are a bit on the drier side, while the macaroni and cheese seems kind of generic. Unfortunately, it has either been phased out or isn't always available, as I was stuck with macaroni salad on our second visit. I can't provide a fair opinion on mac salad since I've intensely loathed it since childhood.  They've since opened up a second location and seem to be doing very well, which is good to hear. Hopefully, they'll continue to grow and tweak things over time. Come to think of it, we haven't stopped by in awhile and it might be time to pay them another visit.   Recommended to try out."}
{"text":"Wandering about looking for a lunch spot we chanced upon POAF to satisfy the bbq craving that had arisen. Spotted amongst the squarish buildings we parked in the special named spaces and sauntered in to be greeted by the food choice line to pick the various meats and preps thereof to create our bbq magnificence. Our party partook in the original with pork, chicken and sausage, whilst the other two in our party decided on salads with pulled pork on top. Weirdly for the side salad with the original there was a choice to include cherry tomatoes but not for the full salads...unclear why this was the case. Regardless the waffle fries and corn bread was quite appreciated on quality. It's not inexpensive - USD12-14 per person but seemingly worth it. A good place if bbq is your thing."}
{"text":"The best smoked food! My favorite sandwich is a beef brisket wrapped in a tortilla! Nice, friendly atmosphere with great employees."}
{"text":"I had been searching for a good BBQ place (specifically a place with good pulled pork) and look no further. This place has lots of options, great sides (I got the waffle fries and pasta salad) and excellent sauce!   The pulled pork sandwich was so tender it was ridiculous. Very tangy BBQ sauce, delicious.   It looks small in the pictures, but there's more seating in the back, and holy cow it's huge!   I will definitely be coming back.  *edit* I have been back a few times, and the food is consistently good. If you rated this place bad, you might have just gotten unlucky. It's definitely good BBQ. The best around, easily. If you think shanes is better, you really have no idea what good BBQ is..."}
{"text":"This place has the best brisket bowels and they are fast. I think the best part is that they are one of the restaurants that use Users delivery service. From the time I decided to order till Uber brought it to my door hot none the less was then then an hour."}
{"text":"I got the brisket sandwich and its one of the best and all the bbq sauces are great.   The baked beans are probably the best ive ever had also and bbq is my go to places. the mac n cheese I didn't care for.  Will be back when im in town and I will be getting the brisket again"}
{"text":"First time here. I got the Deluxe Sampler (chicken, pork, brisket) and 2 sides (cornbread, Mac+cheese) because I wanted to try a little bit of everything.  It's not easy finding a good BBQ place in Arizona. This is the best one I've been to. All the meats were melt-in-your-mouth tender. My favorite was the brisket. Plastic fork, no knife needed for any of it. 4 sauces at the table (sweet, smoky, hot, zippy mustard) so you can have your choice of sauce. I tried them all and the sweet BBQ was my favorite.   Everything is made from scratch. The Mac and cheese was a strong co-star in the dish. I would have given 5 stars but the soda machine was broken so it was only tea, and I wanted a Coke to wash it all down with.  Very positive and recommended experience. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went to visit Pork on a Fork for dinner on a Friday night with my wife.  I'll start with the bad, because there is only one bad thing about the place - it is difficult to find.  It's in a quasi-industrial strip mall and does not have clear signage.  That said, spending the time to find it was worth the wait.    The Location:  No-thrills, semi-divey joint.  Very clean.  My only beef with the location is that it was hard to find.  The Meal:  I had the Smokin' Meal, which has pulled pork, brisket, sausage, and two sides.  The pulled pork was good; very tender and juicy, not dry at all.  The brisket had a nice char on the outside and was beautiful to look at with some very clear smoke rings.  It wasv also very good.  The sausage almost stole the show.  It was perfectly spicy, had just the right amount of snap, and left me wanting more.  I chose corn bread and baked beans for my sides.  The baked beans were great and had burnt ends mixed in.  They were a little on the sweet side for my taste, but still very, very good.  The corn bread, likewise, was good.  Really, though, the meal wasn't about the sides.  If I could have just had the meat I would have (although I lack the self-control for that sort of nonsense.)   My wife had the pulled pork sandwich.  It too came with two sides (corn bread and macaroni and cheese).  She enjoyed the sandwich, particularly with their mild sauce on it (I forget what they name it).  The mac and cheese, which I craftily (no pun intended) stole a large amount of, was great.  It's not fancy, baked, bacon and breadcrumbs restaurant style mac, but is what Kraft Mac and Cheese would be if it was any good.  Bottom line, delicious.  The Service:  Great.  Everyone at the restaurant was very friendly.  The Price:  Affordable.  The Smokin' Meal, which could have fed two people, was around $10.00.  The Pulled Pork Sammie was about $8.00.  Very reasonably priced considering the amount and quality of the food.  Overall:  Will DEFINITELY return to Pork on a Fork.  Bring friends.  I would think that it was worth the drive even if I had come from South Phoenix.  I think it is the best barbecue that I've eaten in the valley."}
{"text":"best barbecue is Arizona.  I dare you to try and finish the mixed grill burrito.  My one gripe is that it's set up like an every day lunch place, but $15 is to spendy for me to do too often  Editing this review because of a bad experience I had when placing a large order for a work function.  I called an hour in advance, and they told me it would be ready in45 minutes.  When I got there 15 minutes after the time they said, the it wasn't even started.  I couldn't wait, so they lost a two hundred dollar order.    Very frustrating experience, and it makes me think they aren't ready to take the next step building the business."}
{"text":"Three out of five stars...  The food was excellent but the service was shitty, we walked in and the menu was backwards from the door. But what got me was all the kids working didn't do a damn thing to sell the amazing food in front of them. I felt as though I was an inconvenience to them, when all I wanted was to eat. I will try it again... I just hope the enthusiasm of the staff increases, because this place has the ability to be great!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on Saturday - being born & raised in TX I thought I would fulfill a BBQ need.  Purchased two plates... Pulled pork sandwich w/2 sides consisting of waffle fries & the macaroni salad 2nd plate was a Sausage sandwich w/2 sides consisting of cold slaw & BBQ beans.  1.  Pulled pork sandwich = meat was generous, tasty and flavorful.  The BBQ sauce the provided added much flavor and was sweet and smooth - very good.  The waffle fries were very tasty, not hot enough... I would have liked them warmer but they were flavorful.  The macaroni salad was your standard \"picnic macaroni salad\" but had a lot of flavor to it.  2.  Sausage sandwich = generous serving and also flavorful (crisp casing and not greasy).  The slaw was a \"no\" not good - strange flavor, spicy cabbage.  The beans were average (mushy from over cooking) but flavorful.  Storefront was clean, quiet and almost empty (not a good sign or it could have been too late for lunch crowd - but on a Sat?).  The staff was friendly, cordial and quick.  They took my order timely and had it to me at the end of the counter and ready to go (and the order was correct).  Pricing was average, after all meat is expensive no matter where you go and you are paying for a MEAL (with two sides).  Overall rating... a 4 to 4.5.  I definitely will come back here when I get the need for beef... BBQ beef (or pork) that is."}
{"text":"Pretty good bbq joint for Arizona and they offer a good selection. I eat lunch here about four times a year, so I would recommend it if you are in the area.  I normally stick with the pulled pork and sausage, but their ribs look pretty good as well.  In summary, I like Little Miss BBQ more, but I will continue to support this local joint as much as I can when I am in north Phoenix."}
{"text":"The baked beans and coleslaw are good. I got the pork with bun the meat is tender and the bun is great. Good for a quick BBQ fix..."}
{"text":"Went to Pork on a Fork based on the great reviews seen here on Yelp!  The reviews were dead on.  This place had the most tender pork and brisket I have had in a while.  I also tried the ribs and they were amazing.  We actually got there 10 minutes to close and were going to just get it to go, but they talked us into eating there.  The location isn't the greatest so they will definitely need some word of mouth.  Also it should be known that their hours are limited (10-7 Mon-Fri only).  We were told that there usually is a line at lunch time.  We will definitely be going back and this time be cognizant of the hours."}
{"text":"Wow! Absolutely Amazing BBQ!!!!   this place allows you to choose your meat (brisket, pulled pork, chicken, pork, sausage, etc) and then they have 4 different barbecue sauces. They have a tangy mustard, a sweet one And a regular barbecue. The regular barbecue sauce was my favorite.  The portions are amazing. I got two sides with a sandwich. The mac and cheese you gotta try with their special spice. At first, I said no thanks to the spice but then the guy said that he'll just sprinkle a little on. I thought that was weird at first, but I'm so glad he did it.   First Step, pick if you want a burrito, bowl, sandwich, Etc. Second Step, pick your meat and then two sides. I got the waffles fries and the mac and cheese.  Gosh how I wish you guys had one of these in California"}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ spot in AZ. I usually get the beef brisket with macaroni and cheese and waffle fries. The meat is cooked really well: it is almost always tender and juicy. They also have good variety of BBQ sauces, from standard to sweet then spicy.  If you're really hungry you can get the sampler plate for around $11 though, that could feed two people in my opinion.  Don't let the outside fool you, this place is great and there is plenty of room for overflow in the back."}
{"text":"Outstanding place for lunch!  Tried the BBQ sampler and everything was terrific.  The baked beans are great and their BBQ sauces are all very tasty.  Great service and top notch BBQ."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful and the workers were very helpful to a couple of first timers. We will certainly be coming back soon. The sample and Midwest monster filled us up with food to spare, an all around great experience."}
{"text":"True BBQ is BBQ that doesn't need sauce to make it taste good.  This place does an excellent job at doing just that.  The meat comes in its purest form - straight off the bbq or smoker.  You put your own sauce on.   We had the pulled pork, chicken, ribs, and brisket.  We all agreed - it was yummy. The pork was my favorite but since I don't eat brisket, I was down to 3 choices.  The chicken was good - not as good as I've had but it was juicy so can't beat that.  The ribs were really good - tender with the perfect bbq grill taste.  For sides we had, the cornbread and mac salad.  Nothing out of the ordinary but I'd get both again.  Next time I'm trying the sausage and mac n cheese.   It comes with rolls but that's just fillers.  One tip, this place is SOOOO Hard to find esp, at night.  We all missed it (3 dif. cars) and kept thinking we had the wrong address.    It is in a business park area across the street from the airport.  Look for the Honeywell building's red sign across and turn into the driveway."}
{"text":"I grew up in Texas and like to think I know a good BBQ, This place is not it.  Their \"lunch special\" (11.99$) comes with two fatty slices of tough brisket, served luke-warm on a store bought bun. I had a tiny cornbread muffin for .50$ and substandard mac and cheese. The food was \"meh\" at best. Below par sides I could forgive, but the BBQ being bad? That is sacriledge! The brisket was tough, had no flavor and was about 30% fat by volume, which means they hadn't cooked it long enough for the fat to melt through the meat (perhaps why it had the lack of flavor?).  I'd give this place a hard pass."}
{"text":"clean, sleek and quiet in the afternoon PLUS the smoked chicken was probably the juiciest i have ever had."}
{"text":"Excellent baby back ribs. the meat is tender and the seasoning is right on. this one is not the dry rub version. but slow cook with sauce that caramelize all over the ribs.  don't use the sauce, because it can ruin the rib taste. just savor the meat. this place is a keeper in phoenix."}
{"text":"By far the best bbq in North phoenix, the Midwest monster is amazing, food always tastes fresh like it never seems your getting day old food.  Parking lot kinda sucks and fills up fast but well worth it for the food"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me and I finally got to try it. Awesome food and great service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We were in town on Business. Was referred to by my local Business Associate. What a great place, food was great and so was the service. Our Sever Brooke gave us a location were to go for pool and darts. Had some electronic issues, General Mgr Jake helped me feel at ease....Thank you POAF, I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Just an update, my wife has also started really enjoying this place.  The shocker to this is that she is a vegetarian. She loves some of the side items (Waffle Fries, Mac & Cheese, Corn Bread, etc.)  She will meet me here for lunch on occasion. I convinced her to try a tiny bit of the pulled pork, and surprisingly she said the flavor was very good."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this Bar B Q!   New location on 19th & Camelback.  HORRIBLE!!!  The meat was dry and hard!I would guess they were overcooked!  The coleslaw had no taste whatsoever.  The bake beans taste the way dirty, sweaty socks smell!  I am so mad and upset!!!  $16.00 totally wasted!  Believe it or not, I actually have had better at Aj's (when I can't get to Bobby Ques quickly).  I should have known the ribs were not that good, because it was only 3 - 4 people in there at what should have been their busiest time of day!  I wish you well Pork on a fork, because I will not be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork was moist, sauce choices were nice, staff very friendly, but too bad they're Cornhusker fans. :-)   This place is getting busy and time to find a larger location but the small, quaint ambience gives it that small town local barbecue place feel.   Better than Dillon's.   Cole slaw was crunchy and not runny. Potato salad is perfect. I don't like macaroni salad and theirs was good. Ribs were fall off the bone.   Just a really good place."}
{"text":"BBQ Done right, Awesome SMOKEY Flavor!  Got the brisket sandwich, coleslaw & sweet potato fries.  Sandwich was rockin! Enjoyed every bit of it!  You can tell they know what they are doing . . . Rich and Flavorful rub with some VERY NICE sauces to complement.  We LOVED the spicy!  Look forward to going back soon!  Only complaint: the brisket was not trimmed, so there were a few mouths full of fat that were not pleasant . . . but I guess its to be expected sometimes."}
{"text":"No. Noooo thank you.  My friend ranted and raved about this place - it sounded good, close to work, and I was in the mood for some BBQ.  I purchased a pulled chicken BBQ sandwich, side of mac and cheese, and.... waffle fries I think (obviously, unforgettable). Within the first bite of my chicken sammich, I found a chicken joint thing within the chicken.... There was only a bun, pulled chicken, and bone fragments (no additional toppings).  They did have a lot of different types of sauces and they were great (hence the two stars instead of one)!  The mac and cheese was super bland and mushy.  The actual restaurant is near deer valley airport, in an office plaza, and has an industrial feel to the inside.  If you really like BBQ, check it out, but check the food before you take your first bite!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ since we left Oklahoma!  Very midwest BBQ- just as advirtised!  Loved that they offered for us to taste any side we wanted.  Smoked flavor was awesome, but not overwhelming!  We got the PoBoy and the Midwest Monster!  All the meats were wonderful!  I love the sauces on the side.  We tried them all and every bite had a different flavor.  Waffel fries were crisp and full of flavor.  The baked beans tasted like my homemade 2 day cooked beans.  Prices not bad for portion size.  Very friendly staff.  We went at 5 PM on a Friday and we had no problems with parking or a table.  This is our new favorite place and plan to go once a week."}
{"text":"Been here several times. BBQ is excellent as is the sides. Service is fast as the BBQ is pre made and ready. Plenty of seating in back area."}
{"text":"Got take out yesterday. That was a mistake. The ribs were over cooked and very dry and the potato salad was swimming in a spicy mayo concoction. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"BBQ to die for. I am definitely not a lover of brisket and wanted to ask the lady serving me to switch it out, but I was floored. The brisket is moist and tender and melted in my mouth. I always avoided brisket because it is normally dry and tough. I don't know what their secret is, but it definitely was the best on the plate. All of the meats were moist and juicy with a delicate smokiness. I liked that it was not overpowering.  I had the baked beans and coleslaw for my sides and both were delicious. Beans were well seasoned and slow cooked so that the flavors were developed through out. The coleslaw was crisp and well seasoned My favorite sauce was the tangy bbq. The hot was too salty for my taste but worked well if mixed together.  Service was great and would recommend for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Ok; thought I'd give this place a try.   Food was mehhhh. Sandwich was dry meat was dry and chewy.   They serve it to you in styrofoam containers; plastic utensils. Way to be environmentally friendly.   No thanks."}
{"text":"Ok, this place is good. I think is much better that the dickies bbq four great sauces. Clean place. Believe it or not the food had a smoked taste. I got a combo 3 meats for 11.00, that is too cheap... with 2 sides. This place is a solid 4 stars"}
{"text":"Wow. I can't Believe It took me so long to finally visit Pork in the Fork! Even though I've been seeing all the positive reviews for a while. Well I bought a Groupon several months ago for it and I totally forgot about and came on my last day. Man this was some serious good BBQ! We ordered a pulled pork and a brisket sandwich with Mac n cheese and corn bread and a side of waffle fries. Now I'm picky on BBQ and I think I can smoke some good meat in my backyard..but this was out of this world. The pulled pork was great..best I've ever had at a restaurant. And the brisket was full of flavor and I could really taste the smoke. I will come back and make it a regular stop.   Located in a small strip mall across from DV airport..it's easily missed. Not much for ambiance inside but the back room is alright  with a few tvs. I'd prob take out next time and they take phone orders so I will order some take out.   All in all POAF is the best BBQ in the Phoenix area. I've been to the great Salt Lick in Austin and this gives overall food a run for their money."}
{"text":"Why is this place that is so hard to find behind a coffee shop in a industrial area doing so well?  The food!  I only came here because of the great Yelp reviews and Arlin B. seems to like the same things I do.  Just like everyone says \"the pork is unbelievably tender\".  I dont even like pork but I had to try it since so many people were talking it up here.  Well, I can now tell you that I like pork......as long as its from POAF!  Place has expanded to the garage area in back for more seating but we came early so it was not packed yet.  They open at 10am which is awesome for me since I eat breakfast at 6-7 and am usually hungry again by 10.  Service was great, the lady at the counter was super nice and I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and the BBQ plate that I had was so so.  Beef brisket was tough, shredded chicken was a tad too dry and the pulled pork was ok. Ended throwing away the brisket! The corn bread was so small it shouldn't be considered a side!  It was just meat and 2 sides and they don't even give you bread or roll.  In Texas where I came from, BBQ there is so much better and they give you all the hot rolls you want!!  Since moving back to Phoenix we had tried other BBQ places here and they were better!  Well tried this place one more time 5-1 -17. Most likely will never come back! Had their pulled pork sandwich and the bun was very stale and hard! Pulled pork was terrible and had so many hard pieces in it. Had a side salad and it just came with lettuce and a couple of cherry tomatoes with ranch dressing that tasted like it was old! I think I'll go now over to Dickeys instead!!"}
{"text":"We began our exploration of their BBQ when they first opened up shop at the Deer valley location. It was pretty good BBQ back then so it was easier to deal with the sub par customer service and banal conditions of the restaurant. On our most recent visit, the quality of the food had plummeted wherefore there is no longer a single redeeming factor. The restaurant is dirty, staff appears to be marginally invested in assisting customers, cost is too high for what you get, and our final thoughts upon leaving were \"not going to be back anytime soon (if ever).  There are lots of new BBQ places popping up all over the valley making it much easier to be more selective!"}
{"text":"By far some of the most amazing bbq in the valley. While wait times can be excessive during lunch it's completely worth it. If you can plan ahead to order online that would be preferred otherwise you'll wait in line... But it's so worth it. Try a Midwest monster and their Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"On a whim my boyfriend decides this is the place for BBQ  he raves about how AWESOME the pulled pork is!! We walk in and it smells amazing! The young girl (blonde w/glasses) behind the counter seems a bit not happy she really must not like working here. Anyhow after waiting sometime in line we reach the said girl and you are out of pulled pork!!! How does PORK ON A FORK RUN OUT OF PORK??? On a Saturday evening  Hmmm maybe next time if there is one hahaha"}
{"text":"This little BBQ spot has lots of choices for a good meal. A huge variety of meats, lots of fixins and sides and a wonderful sampling of sauces. I stopped in after visiting a nearby gun shop who said the food was good. They were right.      I had the brisket, slaw, beans and added a couple of ribs to try them. The best item was the ribs. Cooked nicely with a good crust, nice smoke ring and lots of flavor. I enjoyed the brisket. I'm hard to please when it comes to brisket. Most places have bland brisket, mostly because they don't smoke it right. I really like the flavor of this brisket. I will admit that it could have been a little moister but the fact that it tasted good compensated for it.      Both sides were very good. I look forward to trying the pulled pork next time.      I (as always) tried all the sauces. They were all good, but the regular sauce was the best.      If I lived close by, this would be a weekly place to eat.      I'd say this is the 4th best BBQ place I've been to in the valley in my 30 years here. I still have more to try, but this place will be hard to beat."}
{"text":"Delicious! Best BBQ so far in Phoenix I've had. Portions are huge, meats and sides are very flavorful. Definitely get everytbing in a burrito atleast once."}
{"text":"I've been living in this area for two years now and I recently discovered this place. It's tucked away and resembles many other businesses in the area. In fact, the dining room was converted from a garage. This restaurant may have once been an auto shop, and that's part of its appeal. Pork on a Fork is a diamond in the rough. The food is great and the prices are reasonable. Will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Been here 2 times for lunch. You get lots of flavorful food. Line is kind of slow but it;s worth it."}
{"text":"Really great food - taste, texture, temperature and appearance are all fantastic. Dining hall is clean and new with a few big screen tvs.  This restaurant is hidden away in a office storage/warehouse complex. No sign on the street (that I could see), you just have to trust that maps is bringing you to the right place."}
{"text":"I've never posted a good or bad review on yelp, but this place is just a solid disappointment and for one main reason......the service (you order at a counter) is brutally slow.  whether there is 1 person in line or 10 the younger aged crew seems to work in slow motion.   the food is good, and i understand good things come to those who wait, but waiting in line for 20-30 minutes at times for half a dozen customers in front of you is absurd.  i waited three hours at franklins in austin, but the line was literally around the neighborhood but they execute the ordering extremely efficiently and very quick.   i've owned a restaurant, but don't think i'm being overly critical just because of that, i just understand how quick they could execute but it truly pains me to watch the counter help move as slow as they do.  the food is already cooked ladies and gentleman, let's get a move on it.   i won't be bringing my $$$ or referrals there until they realize that it's good food but not worth the ridiculous wait to take food to go or eat in.  makes me want to almost open up a bbq joint nearby just to show their current customers that you don't have to wait for just good bbq."}
{"text":"OMG the best baby back ribs I have ever tasted. My favorite baby back ribs before this food experience was the Mason Jar in Mahwah NJ. I have always compared baby back ribs to the Mason Jar to see if any would compare. After over ten years of searching I have found the perfect baby back rib to beat the Mason Jar. Pork on a fork is truly world class. No need for the BBQ sauce but they have a nice variety and I tried two that I liked. The hot BBQ sauce and the Carolina BBQ style sauce were both excellent on my ribs. However you know you are eating excellent ribs when you keep forgetting to pour on the sauce. Pork on the fork ribs were tender fall off the bone delicious. I will return and bring all my rib loving friends."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner. It wasn't at all crowded. But still a nice vibe to the place. The guy preparing meals behind the counter was very nice and patient with us newbies. I had a brisket bowl - never thought to have BBQ that way. It was really good. The brisket was very tender and juicy with a bit of crust on the edges. Lots of choices for toppings/additions. My husband had a pulled pork sandwich. He thought the pork was a little fatty for his taste, but once he got rid of some of the fat he thought it was very good. And their Cole slaw is near perfect in my book - creamy with a just right sweet/tangy flavor. Another great place to eat in our new neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ordered the barbecue sampler and 2 sides of bbq sauce and when I got home there was no bbq sauce. Missing the best part made me realize the meat had a chemical taste. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The BBQ was fantastic... I've been trying for 2 weeks to no avail to get a response for catering a party..  They must not need the buisness"}
{"text":"The food was amazing.   The pork was tender - chicken flavorful - as well as brisket and smoked sausage.    We got sampler dishes with Mac and cheese, corn, and potato salad.  Price to me was perfect for the amount of food given.   Only gave four stars because the service could have been quicker.   Went on a Saturday afternoon and only had two people working up front with a line to the door.     Took 20 minutes to order and take food out door.  But food is worth wait."}
{"text":"Went here on lunch with a co worker. VERY good food! We had the pulled pork, cole slaw, potato salad and cornbread. Excellent food, excellent service. My recommendation: have the mac and cheese every day! :)"}
{"text":"Pork On A Fork, I had such high hopes.  It started with a phone call...  I called to make a takeout order and was put on hold immediately. I hung up after a long 5 minutes. Ok, no big deal - they're busy with their lunch rush, that's a good thing, right?  Except when I got there they weren't busy (anymore perhaps). Whatever, no biggie. A young couple was in front of me and it took about 10 minutes for me to talk to a person that could take my order. Again, not a huge deal, I'm a pretty patient person. I ordered the Midwest Monster, a sandwich that makes waves around town and even on Triple D with Guy. The description looked amazing. But it's too bad my sandwich was missing both the cheese and the slaw. It was a package of meat and a couple slices of jalapeño, foil wrapped and in between the buns. Nothing else. What a let down. Should I have been watching the girl make my sandwich? Who knows. So I had to slather the whole stack of somewhat dry meat and bread with some BBQ sauce and came away disappointed and $13 poorer. The Mac and cheese was good but I honestly think the corn bread was the best part. I'm all about second chances, so maybe it'll be better next time. But even if the order was made correctly, I didn't get that wow factor I was expecting from all the accolades and press this place has gotten. It's divey, doesn't have that mom and pop BBQ feel, and just was unimpressive. I guess that's the problem with building a place up so much...ok, I'm just rambling now. So, to make a long story longer: They were poor on the phone Slow to take your order Failed at making my item correctly. Cornbread was delicious. Girls working were cute."}
{"text":"Not sure how the meat is cooked, but the pork lost its texture and disintegrated when eaten. Strange how the texture of the meat was so off. Nice service. Bummer."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for BBQ out and for family events at home!  Everything is great, the meats, the sides, the service!"}
{"text":"If I could give pork on a fork no stars I would.... so about 7 months ago I ate here and got violently ill. I haven't been back till today. Not only does the staff scratch their faces and handle non food items without changing their gloves and lick their fingers to separate the to-go bags, but I get to the register and ask for 4 BBQ sauce sides. The girl proceeds to tell me that I only get 1 tiny side of BBQ sauce for free, and the rest I have to pay extra for. A BBQ place that charges for BBQ sauce?!!! I hope you enjoy the extra $.82 you received from me because I will never come back. That is absolutely ridiculous. Hope I don't get sick again. I think the owners should put more time and effort into safe food handling procedures and less time worrying about charging for BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Oh my god this place gets a five out of five star review!!! Why??? Because they are that freaking awesome that's why!!! Let me tell you I have been craving barbecue for a long time but I'm very picky about my barbecue, but Yelp suggested this place to me and I read all the reviews and decided to give it a go and I am soooooo glad I did!!! This is definitely bookmarked and my new favorite barbecue spot. :D   So let's talk about the food, I ordered the Midwest monster (which comes with not one but TWO sides) and for my side I chose the honey barbecue beans and the mac & cheese. Both sides were freaking phenomenal! The mac & cheese was just as cheesy as I like it, and the honey baked beans literally reminded me of barbecues with my family. The Midwest monster- ugh! To die for!!! It's half pork and a half brisket, The meet is nice, juicy and tender and mix with all the right flavors! For my drink I got a sweet tea (i'm addicted to sweet tea) and not everybody sweet tea is good, but there is exactly what you expect Southern Sweet tea to taste like. :)  On top of everything else the staff was extremely friendly, the establishment was clean, and the atmosphere was nice. Definitely coming back for you!"}
{"text":"Seriously, this is the best bbq pork ever! I absolutely love POAF, and every time my family visits, they want to eat here! The sauces are so good, but truly the meat doesn't even need any! Oh, and the sides are soooo delicious, too!!!"}
{"text":"I work across the lot from this place and have been dying to try it out.  Unfortunately I work graveyard shifts and they close before my shift begins.  I learned last week that they were going to start staying open till 7 on Fridays.  Finally I would get my chance!  let me tell you I was not disappointed!  I ordered the pulled pork sammich, cornbread and potato salad.  The pulled pork was tender, juicy, smokey and porky!  I got half way through the sandwich when I realized I forgot BBQ sauce it was that good.   The staff were incredibly friendly and the food came out very fast."}
{"text":"Sadly, it's gone downhill in recent years.  I still enjoy the ribs (the full rack comes with two sides) but the sides are servings for one person and not two as they used to be.  I asked for ketchup for the fries and a staff member had to run to the back eating area to fill a cup. Had to ask for BBQ sauce on a \"to go\" order.  And while placing my order over the phone I asked the employee to remind me of the address and she had to ask someone else.  Yep, the employees don't know the address of their work.  Hope a fire doesn't break out."}
{"text":"Tasty new BBQ choice close to home.   Been for lunch a couple of times, the Big Boy Sampler is my favorite (chicken, pork, brisket, sausage).  Meat was flavorful and well prepared.  Good selection of BBQ sauces and beers.   The brisket is particularly tasty.   Tried a few sides, like the cornbread muffin, mac & cheese, and sweet potato fries.   Recommended."}
{"text":"Believe the Hype!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This place Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Definitley in my Top 3 BBQ I have ever had & I've been to Texas & the rest of the South! Best Pulled Pork & brisket hands down!! Also the best Mac & Cheese. Only complaint I have, is of their 4 sauces, I only loved one(Sweet & Mild), but the meat was so, tender juicy & delicious, it didn't need much sauce, if at all. Keep up the good work. I live within 5 miles, so they have a new regular customer for a long time!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Second time here wasn't so grand. My bowl was quite a bit smaller than the first time, same amount of meat but everything else was scarce. They were out of de pepper and claimed none of them knew how to change it. Umm okay."}
{"text":"When they first opened I believe the quality of the meat was at its height. I remember the brisket being smoky, juicy and tender. I ordered the brisket the other day and it was just ok. The brisket plate could use some bread with it."}
{"text":"After class, around 7pm, I decided to eat here on the recommendation of the instructor. My mistake. The baby back ribs were overdone, like they'd been sitting in the oven since the early morning. Since I had a to-go order, I was the \"winner\" by receiving ribs that were tough and dry. Not a \"best ribs\" place at all. Less than a 1-star rating."}
{"text":"Pull pork sandwich with Mac and cheese and potato salad.  All were very tasty!  I tried some of my dad's sampler plate.  The sausage that came with it was delicious and the chicken was moist and flavorful.  I will definitely be coming back to try more off of the menu."}
{"text":"Pork on a Fork is a hidden treasure. Real BBQ is an art. Picasso and da Vinci are in the building! Actually, Wes and Justin (the owners) are as passionate/nice as you can get. As soon as you walk in, you get gently smacked in the face with \"the smell.\" Then they follow through with \"the taste.\" Pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and hot links will make you a big fan of the art of BBQ."}
{"text":"I took a chance and tried this place out for their catering for a work event for 50 people for the first time, and I have to say, we were all very impressed!!! Not a single person had anything bad to say about the food, in fact everyone was talking about how good it was. We ordered 10lbs each of the pulled pork and shredded chicken, which was all very juicy and delicious. We also got the large pans of Mac n cheese, cole slaw, and potato salad. Our order was ready for pickup just before our scheduled pick up time which was great, and the helpful guys carried it all out to my car and made sure to place the cole slaw on top so it didn't get hot. Great customer service!! They are also on fivestars, so with that big order I also earned a couple free meals and I've redeemed one so far- the brisket with some Mac and cheese and the sweet potato fries. The brisket was AMAZING!!!! Better than some of the \"best\" BBQ places in a couple cities that I have tried! Was very tender juicy and flavorful and just melted in my mouth. The sweet potato fries were also perfect, crispy on the outside and soft and hot on the inside. Sauces were also very delicious! Will definitely be back, order again for catering, and recommend to my friends. And a side note their bathroom was extremely clean and smelled good, lol! Thanks so much Pork on a Fork keep up the great w(p)ork!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, if not evenly done. Each time is an experiment in inconsistent portions, techniques and in getting your order right. Prices are fair. Today, however, loud rap music with vulgar lyrics with the F-word be shouted out over and over while there were children about. I don't care for profanities being shouted from the speakers while I eat. I really like the food, but I find the aptitude of the staff leaves a lot to be desired and may try once more before I see if things improve before giving up permanently."}
{"text":"From Chicago and Came out to Pork on a Fork. Their mop sauce and mild BBQ sauce is absolutely delicious. I really enjoyed the Coke slaw and Mac and cheese. The atmosphere is traditional BBQ at its best. The owner has put his love and soul into this place and it's obvious. Support local independent restaurants. They are the back bone of this country, not chains."}
{"text":"I am always looking for great BBQ and Pork on a Fork fit the bill perfectly. It is not a normal restaurant space since the restaurant is in a warehouse district. You order in the front of the warehouse and seating is in the back. I ordered the sampler and found the brisket to be tender and flavorful. The pork and the sausage were also cooked to perfection and flavorful. My sides were the coleslaw and mac and cheese. The coleslaw was ok...not great. The mac and cheese was average. They had multiple options for sauce and I always go for the sweet...and it was very sweet. My only complaint was the bread. It was basically small hamburger buns. I don't know if they gave that so that I could make sandwiches with the brisket and pork or what their thinking was. I would have preferred some other bread."}
{"text":"I noticed when this place opened because I love great BBQ and the fixins. I was REALLY disappointed. for  $14 and some change I tried the Brisket sandwich with Cole slaw, cornbread and a drink. 2.25 for a med sided drink is high-even with free refills. the sweet and mild BBQ sauce was tasty but the sandwich was short on meat, the cornbread was no different than I make at home, room temp and served with a cold butter pat.  The cole slaw left a lot to be desired. It lacked luster, flavor and actually seemed dry. I exchanged it for potato salad that tasted slightly better than the stuff sold at grocery. The last gets the star..tasty. If you know good BBQ you will be disappointed. Staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Decided to give these guys a try on my way home from work yesterday.   I walked in to order take out.   I ordered the chopped pork sandwich, with waffle fries and corn muffin.   When I got home, no fries, and it wasn't like they were busy or anything.   Too bad, because the pork was fairly tasty.   I would have rated them higher, but the service was lacking."}
{"text":"Normally this wouldn't be my type of establishment to come to with a sign greeting you upon entering that says \"all of our meat comes naked.\"  I overlook this statement as their pulled pork is amazing and bbq choices are top notch.  This place is located right near the Deer Valley airport in a boring business center, but when you serve great food it really doesn't matter where your location is.  Expect a line to get into the place during peak times as many others know that their bbq is awesome.  Don't let the line deter you as you won't be disappointed.   My addiction of choice is the pulled pork sandwich topped with a delicious smokey & tangy bbq sauce, sides of waffle fries and mac & cheese.  Follow this order and you will thank me later!"}
{"text":"Wasn't great.   Heard great things, but wasn't impressed.    We got the sampler, ribs and a bunch of sides.  Ordered ahead and when we got there they said they accidentally sold the last of the ribs and forgot about our order.   Took forever after we paid, around 30 minutes.   Started out with a bad taste in our mouth, and then the food was just ok.   Although, we didn't get to try the ribs so not sure on those."}
{"text":"First Saturday customer!  All of the meat was outstanding!  The ribs amongst the best I've ever had.  I was in Amarillo recently,  and I'd stack this meat up against theirs any time!  As for sides, the beans were the best followed by the waffle fries.  Potato salad was standard fare, slaw was crispy and fresh. The wife and kid were equally impressed.  Overall great experience. The owners were friendly and helpful...excellent job guys!!  Update:10/17/2011  I'm currently in Bangalore India and I swear to God, I would crawl over a mile of ground glass for a pork sandwich, slaw and beans right now!  I would clean Rosie O'Donald's toilets for a full rack of the best smoked, and best tasting ribs in Phoenix, and just about anywhere else.  I've got another week of wondering around in the BBQ (pork and beef) wilderness that is Bangalore before I stagger through their door and beg to be allowed to sleep in their smoker for an hour or two, then graze my way through the meat counter!  I can almost taste it now.....yumyummm  (If you find yourself in Bangalore, Hit the Hard Rock Cafe for a 10oz burger to keep from going insane.  It's dry, but it's beef, and that's hard to find here.  Even McDonald's doesn't have a beef burger.)"}
{"text":"Been to this place a bunch of times, good prices, good food, and quick. My 1 year old son really enjoys it too since the pulled pork is already the perfect size for him to eat."}
{"text":"Just an average BBQ place. I would describe it more as a fast food BBQ place.. got the pulled pork sandwich pretty tasty but bit into a lot of fat- cornbread I couldn't eat because it was cooked for too long so it was hard and stuck to the wrapper not moist or fresh and the MAC n cheese was pretty good! The BBQ sauce was yummy but the hot option isn't really spicy at all- still good place to go if you're craving BBQ and in the area- 5 star for customer service!!"}
{"text":"Update.  Something went wrong with Pork On A Fork.  The last two times I was there, the meat was dry, tough and if you didn't use a lot of sauce, tasteless.  My wife feels the same way.  We have stopped going here.  Dickie's on Bell Rd and 7th Street is far, far superior and a better variety of food."}
{"text":"Came here late on a Saturday and they were out of almost everything. Apparently the Groupon they offered caused quite a crowd. Everyone was very apologetic and friendly. Ordered the half slab of ribs with waffle fries. I couldn't believe how large the half slab was when I got it. Meat was delicious and I did not use any extra sauce as the rub on the bones was SO good. Waffle fries were also very good and I left stuffed to the chin with a to go box. My dinner companions both ordered full slabs and could not finish their meals either...quite unusal for both of them as they are big eaters. The parking was not a big deal on Sunday but I can see where it would be a problem during the work week. They have signs everywhere asking their customers to be respectful of the neighbors. What a crazy place to put a BBQ joint! They also serve beer. Can't wait to go back and try some more of the menu."}
{"text":"We had the platter and beef brisket.chicken was very dry.link was perfect.beans were great.mac and cheese was pretty good.some cheese was not melted.beef brisket was good.beans were great.coleslaw was very bland.hopefully better next time."}
{"text":"Very glad my friend suggested we meet here for lunch; lived seven years in Southern barbecue land and really miss it after moving to the northeast. This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"The wife and I decided to give this place a try since I'm a sucker for pulled pork and we've been looking to try new places closer to our side of town.   First off, this place is not the easiest to find. I drove past it the first time since they're sort of in the middle of the business park they occupy and they don't have a sign that you can see until you're just about past the entrance. I guess I can't blame them for that, but it was somewhat annoying.   As far as the food, however, I am impressed. Having set foot inside the place, my first impression was that it was very low-key, bare-bones, no-frills and such. I don't mind that, but sometimes it gives me hesitation about the food. Nevertheless, I was impressed by the pulled pork and so was my wife. It comes dry and you get your own pick of the sauce (they have several varieties) and can apply as much as you see fit. I really like that, because most places don't give you a say at all and the BBQ sauce is what makes the pulled pork sandwich.   The waffle fries were really, really good as was the pasta salad side order I had. I didn't care too much for the baked beans, but I wouldn't dare detract from the rating over that, since the pulled pork sandwich itself was the main draw and did not disappoint me in any way, shape or form.  Overall I was really impressed by this place, as the small 'hole in the wall' style places generally are more fun to eat at. I definitely love the food and the location (now that I can find it!) and was really happy to finally try a place that exceeded my expectations.   I will definitely be back in the near future and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very displeased with this restaurant. I had the one of the samplers. The brisket and chicken was dry. I also had a side salad that had a hair in it. Then I realized no one had hair nets or hats on. When I told one of the employees about the hair she tried to offer me the same side."}
{"text":"Wow what great tasting pulled pork and smoked chicken. Well worth the drive. Good value and portion ratio. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Simple meat options plopped onto a metal tray .. but deliciously cut and seasoned, with lots of different house sauces."}
{"text":"I am calling it average BBQ. Not bad but not really good. I really liked the Brisket which was really moist but the pulled pork was pretty dry overall. I also had a side of slaw and macaroni salad both of which seemed like they needed a little seasoning or something to help it pop because they didn't really stand out. If I came back I would just stick to the Brisket I think."}
{"text":"First, the food: Amazing. It always hits the spot and is always more than enough for any human to consume. I want to drink their sweet and mild BBQ sauce from a wine glass every night. The mac n cheese had some magical seasoning on it that is reminiscent of my favorite Cajun seasoning. The coleslaw could use more lemon because it's pretty bland but that's my only  food-related complaint.   Second, the service: Touch and go. Some times we visit and everyone is warm and friendly and the dining area is well stocked. Other times, like the last time we went, we had to repeat our order several times before they could process what we said, and my husband waited a good 5 extra minutes for his meal. The dining area looked like it hadn't been tended to all day. I was able to get the last four remaining forks for my family of five. The trash cans were coated in a thick layer is BBQ sauce goo and the restroom had no toilet paper, a small overflowing mountain of used paper towels (some of which I'm sure were used as substitute toilet paper) and it was obvious nothing was cleaned.   The takeaway: The food is amazing. So ordering to go will be a home run every time. Just don't have high expectations of your dining experience if staying to eat."}
{"text":"Came in and got a beautiful pound of pork for $10. Smoky, gorgeous color, lil bit of bark, cooked perfect. Hit the spot. Thanks."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ pork and beef. Family owned and operated. The sauces are sweet to spicy and the sides are the best. Not all baked beans are the same and you'll not find better in the state."}
{"text":"What's going on Pork on a Fork? I've always been a fan and highly recommended your restaurant but lately I've been pretty disappointed.  The last couple of times we have ordered from you guys it hasn't been up to your old standards.  The meat I ordered was mostly fat and seemed like it had been sitting in the oven all day. It was extremely tough and dry. Since we didn't get the sauce we ordered with our meals we couldn't even drown the taste. The beans aren't like they used to be either. They used to have some great spice to them with nice size chunks of meat added in. Now it seems like a can of pork-n-beans has been opened with some bbq sauce mixed in.  The cole slaw and macaroni salad are still good. As is the mac-n-cheese. Waffle fries are decent too.  I will probably give it one more chance and am hoping to get what we used to get. Good old bbq."}
{"text":"I never try any place that's less than 5 stars on Yelp unless it's been highly recommended. But I came across Pork on a Fork through Uber Eats. It was good enough to order twice! Get the baked beans, macaroni and cheese, and cornbread as sides...trust me. Must warn everyone though, this is a heavy meal that's flavorful. If you're looking for a healthy option this is NOT the place. This is more of a cheat meal packed high in proteins AND bad fats...delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Friendly, personable staff. Clean environment. THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here yesterday and I knew the moment I walked in I was in for a treat! The smell of freshly smoked meats was intoxicating!  First, if you weren't looking for this place, you would not know there was an eating establishment here. It's on the end of a building in a small business park.  There was a line of about 12 people when I walked in around 11:30am and when I left it had grown to about 20! (Always a good sign!) I used the bathroom first and there was no soap (or soap dispenser)! That's the main reason I am leaving 4 stars instead of 5. Not only is that nasty but I believe the health department would \"ding\" them for that.  On to the important part of the review - the food! I ordered a \"Big Boy\" which was a large sampler platter which consisted of pulled chicken, pulled pork, brisket and smoked sausage. The brisket seemed to be the star of the show! It's the one thing I noticed everyone ordering and I actually ordered an extra portion myself! The samplers also came with two sides, I got the waffle fries and mac 'n cheese. All this plus a a drink came out to be $21 and change. This is the other reason I didn't leave 5 stars, the food overall was really good but that price is steep for a tiny little joint that caters to mostly blue collar workers.  Here is the verdict in the food:  Brisket - excellent Pulled pork - excellent  Pulled chicken - average  Smoked sausage - average   Mac 'n cheese - very good  Waffle fries - very good  Drink - I combined the ice tea and lemonade to make an Arnold Palmer and it tasted horrible! Unfortunately, I didn't taste the drink until I was driving away. Maybe the syrup was running low for the Country-time lemonade?  I asked to try the basic BBQ sauce (they have 4 choices) and the guy at the counter threw some plastic containers with what looked to be homemade sauce in my bag. Unfortunately, the two little containers weren't nearly enough and I didn't realize it until I had gotten to work. The guy knew I ordered extra meat so he should have at least put extra sauce in my bag or asked me if I wanted more. It's the little details that can really make a difference between a good place to eat and an excellent \"must have\" dining establishment.  All in all, some minor issues but what they do, they do well! The food is really good as is their service! I took mine to go but it looked like they had a little sit down section in the back.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best pulled pork in Phoenix!! Great food from the top of the menu to the bottom. You won't regret trying this BBQ"}
{"text":"We jus moved into the neighborhood and we're hungry from moving all day. We found this great hole in wall BBQ joint. There prices are great and so is the food! A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"REALLY good BBQ, LOVE the BBQ burrito. Generous servings, excellent food, great service - reasonably priced. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was good lady running the place terrible. Young man was taking my order and you could tell he was new. Lady was yelling at him to hurry up (not sure why I was the only one in line) then came over and started telling him off. He tried to ask her a question she told him to shut up. Pulled him over to the side to continue belittling him, never even acknowledged me just walked away. Another employee stepped over from whatever task she was doing and finished taking my order. She mouthed the words I'm sorry clearly not wanting the manager or whoever she was to hear. So if you want to watch employees get tested bad then go here."}
{"text":"Had the Family Feast and it did not disappoint!!! The ribs were fork tender, great smoke flavor and smoke ring!  Their mustard sauce on their smoked sausages were great!  We ordered coleslaw as a side and made pulled pork mini burgers with the slaw which had great crunch texture and not overpowering in flavor.  Great balance!  Also included was smoked chicken and brisket.  Man was that some good eating!!!  Chicken was fork tender and the brisket falls apart easily with great flavor. I WILL be going back and think it's some of the best BBQ in the valley!  They did have these marshmallow bacon brownies that are on my list of items to try next!!!"}
{"text":"We used a restaurant.com gift card here and it was fantastic.   We ordered the Family Style Meal for 89.99 and had to push two long picnic tables in the back together for room for the food. It was really good and their BBQ sauces were fantastic I couldn't tell which one I liked better so I used all four.   Their cornbread and rolls were delicious and moist, their meat was amazing and the ribs fell right off the bone.   The place may look small but they have a big room in the back that has plenty of seating for big parties and all the condiments/sauces you could need within arms reach as well.  Pros: Just about everything! Cons:They close too early and are in an odd location, it looks like an industrial strip mall on Deer Valley Rd.  All in All I will certainly be back, and my kids are already begging for me to bring them take out from here."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! I ordered the smoked sausage burrito with two sides. The portion was just right. Thank you! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I just finished eating here. It was GOOD!!! I had the sampler but upgraded to include the brisket. It all went down so easy and nice. The sampler included pulled pork, brisket, chicken thigh and mac n' cheese. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Phenomenal BBQ! We had the brisket sandwich and the Smokin Plate. Everything exceeded our expectations. I'm only sorry that we don't live closer!"}
{"text":"DAMN good BBQ.  Really yummy beans. Free refills on drinks.  Small dining area up front, but the back area is HUGE.  don't come here for the eating area, it's pretty spartan.  Come here for the beef, the chicken, the pulled pork.  NOTHING bad."}
{"text":"I checked this place out originally based on the reviews that I had seen here on Yelp and I must agree that the food here is pretty good.      I'm very picky when it comes to BBQ and its been difficult at times to find reliable, good-tasting BBQ in Phoenix but Pork on a Fork definitely delivers in that regard.      The pulled pork sandwich I had was terrific, soft, very flavorful, enjoyed it tremendously and the cole slaw and beans were both on-point.     All in all I would definitely recommend this place and will be going back here many more times in the future."}
{"text":"I'm nor sure what all they hype was about this place. Maybe another casualty of getting on TV, and then raising prices lowering quality. I ordered a Midwest Monster. It was ok, nothing to write home about. The meat on it was very good it comes with Jalapenos and cheese and coleslaw. My only knock on the sandwich was that it was twelve dollars, It was microwaved to melt the cheese, and served on fifty cent bun from fry's. Again the meat on the sandwich was very good it wasn't warm though, obviously not hot enough to melt cheese.  But it comes with two side dishes you say.   I ordered the Mac and Cheese and Waffle Fries. The waffle fry's were the kind you get in the frozen section of your local supper market, and while the portion wasn't small it was also served cold. They were not fried from what I can tell but heated in an oven at some point and served room temp.To say I was unimpressed well no that is exactly what I was unimpressed.   But you also got Mac and Cheese you say.  Crazy as this sounds it was also served cold, or what could be considered room temperature. We had Kraft Mac and Cheese the night before my wife told me it was better. The one thing I can say is they put a little paprika on the top and it does look like they make it from scratch. Not sure who else serves cold mac and cheese though I've never had it served that way at a restaurant before.   In Short it was twelve bucks for what couldn't even be called a real meal. Room temperature side dishes and a microwaved sandwich. I will add the staff was great and moved us right along.  I could have gone to Five Guys and saved myself 4 bucks and had a happy belly."}
{"text":"Went Saturday night at about 7pm. There were 3 of us and we had pulled pork, brisket and ribs. The staff was friendly however the food was disappointing. All the meats were dry. Good smoke flavor but none of the meats tasted fresh. I had beans and waffle fries for sides and liked both very much.  We also tried the mac and cheese and thought it could have been more fresh as well. Dining area was fine however the bbq sauce bottles were all dirty and looked as though they hadn't been cleaned in a while.  We have been in the past and liked it however this last visit was quite a disappointment due to the dry (all of them) meats.  Come on guys, I know you can do better!"}
{"text":"Awesome surprise! Drove by it a few times before deciding to try it. Weird location & strange layout, but if you can get past that, the food is great! I've tried several things but you can't beat the pulled pork. The mac & cheese is awesome too. Very very fair pricing. One of the better BBQ I've had in Phoenix. Recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ in Phoenix. The pulled pork melts in your mouth and the sausage is perfectly cooked. Get the Smokin' Meal - it is a combo of pork, brisket, and sausage, plus you get two sides. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"LOVE the BBQ flavor of the meats here, all are good.  We didn't like the sides much though (personal taste?).  It would be nice to have a few kid options and maybe some smaller choices for when you don't want a HUGE meal but a smaller one.  Other than that, Oh Yeah!  What a gem hidden away - get some more advertising!"}
{"text":"Great food and place. Amazing brisket made fresh, pork is tasty, sausage is amazing, their sides are awesome.  Enjoy it here."}
{"text":"It's rare that with four kids and two adults we can all find something we really like. This is that place.    The beans are fantastic. Well, all of their sides are great.  The meats are wonderful.  I've yet to question their wood selections for smoking or cooking times/temps but they know just what they are doing with briskets, butts, and chickens.  We've been here twice and will go back again."}
{"text":"My company orders here on a normal basis.  This time we had an even smaller order, I placed my order online for Friday the 17th between 11:15 & 11:30.. It was easy to place an online order... Then, after my order was placed and the money was taken from my account I get a confirmation email for Wednesday between 3:15 & 3:30.. I called them immediately and spoke with someone on the catering line who assured me that he saw the order and would make sure it was ready on Friday at 11am. Well, we do down to pick up our food today and they say they have no record of an order for today! That they had our order ready on Wednesday and no one showed up! Um, WHAT?! Ultimately, we got our order and 20% off our next order but we had to wait for nearly 30 minutes. It's a good thing their food is so good!"}
{"text":"So so good not to be missed.  Great people and all the sauces on the table are amazing"}
{"text":"Great flavor! Prices were very affordable.  I fed 4 people for $35ish. This will definitely be on my list of BBQ options"}
{"text":"The food was very good for a fast/casual environment. Wasn't expecting to have such flavorful BBQ from a quick place like this. The coleslaw was quite refreshing with great flavor, baked beans were excellent with a mild pepper taste, the chicken and pork were also excellent but the brisket was surprisingly dry. Assortment of BBQ sauces was a nice selection, decor was good. I would've given them 4 stars for food but I'm giving them 3 stars for service because there was only 1 person in front of me and the meat carver was painfully slow. There was no smile and I could barely hear what he was asking due to his mumbling. The 2nd server who compiled my sides was very nice and pleasant but I asked several times for something and even after I was seated, I realized I still didn't have it so had to get up and ask again. I'd give them another try again if in the area since I did enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I'm in trouble, real trouble with this joint.  It is the most delicious BBQ I've ever had.  No more \"chains\" for me, now it's all about Pork on a Fork.  They are two doors down from where I work so it's super convenient to get my pulled pork fix.  I could really just make a meal out of their sides as well. The coleslaw was fresh and crisp. Baked beans tasted smoky and sweet.  Oh and don't let me forget about the crispy on the outside, tender on the inside sweet potatoe fries.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a beef brisket sandwich. Both were enough to feed me for 4 days!  There was a lot of meet on those sandwiches.  All in all, my belly is happy, even if my waistline is not.  :)"}
{"text":"Brisket bowl awesome! Coleslaw base is perfect and the tender tasty brisket is excellent!  Friendly staff too, always say hello and offer to help right away."}
{"text":"First time. It was a little difficult to notice from the road. The brisket was fall to pieces yummy! The beans had a peppery kick. The potato salad was run of the mill. The sausage was good. We were a little disappointed that they ran out of pork as we wanted to do the sampler. The couple behind us just left. I think they should've offered a small discount or something. All in all, good food. Relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with the hubs after repeatedly hearing about it from friends. I got the brisket (no bun), macaroni salad, and coleslaw. All 3 were AMAZING!  I like that they serve their meat \"naked\" so you can add your own amount and type of sauce. The 4 sauce choices are awesome too! A spicy mustard, Carolina-style sweet sauce, smoky BBQ, and super spicy BBQ sauce...so nice to choose!   In true semi-gluttons style, dessert was devoured by the hubs and me before dinner....brownie with walnuts, marshmallow, chocolate sauce, AND BACON BITS ON TOP!!!!!! LOVE!   Despite not being a super BBQ lover, the casual atmosphere, happy and efficient workers, and amazing food have definitely given this gal incentive to return!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for yelping by neighborhood, we never woulda found this place. We cheated and checked their website first, which informed us that they feature their family-farm pork from Nebraska, so we went in knowing to order pork, rather than beef. That obviously meant pulled pork and brats (they apparently feature a different flavored brat each day).  So, after a bit of driving around the industrial park (We turned in a tad too early, so toured the park) we found it and grabbed one of the few spots marked as theirs on the curb.   Athena ordered the pulled pork sammie with mac/cheese and potato salad. I went beans and potato salad along with my brat - \"Sorry, we're out\". PANIC set in, I hadn't actually studied the menu...so what did I do? Yep. Same thing everyone does when they panic at a BBQ place...went brisket.   Brisket is nice and tender but it in no way matches the quality, juiciness and flavor of the pulled pork. We tried two sauces - hands down winner? Zippy Mustard, which I tend to think of as a Carolina 'Cue kinda thing and seem to lean that way in my sauce tastings these days.   The beans are good, and well-flavored but I still stick by Honey Bear's as having the best beans (Cow-Bro beans) of all the BBQ joints around.   I do say though, if Im gonna go pulled pork (we split our sammies half and half and shared)I'd head here - not only because its closer but I liked it better (Although I'm partial to the ribs at HB).  The potato salad wasn't to our liking much. Not that it's bad (it features red skinned potatoes) - but I'm pretty partial to \"my\" kinda potato salad - made with Best Foods mayo and tons o' mustard with no little pickles/relish in it. What can I say? I'm not a Southerner. POAF has the pickles and I'm pretty sure its Miracle Whip..  The tables were clean, and almost all taken by local workers from the surrounding area. They have wetnaps easily available, and they have awesome lever-driven plastic utensil dispensers which are a cool, if kitschy, touch.  Staff is friendly. Place is clean. GO EARLY if you want a brat. They open at 10a and are sold out by 1p...So next time - Im headed b4 lunch rush hits."}
{"text":"YUM! Our go-to BBQ place nearby closed recently so we've been on the hunt for smoked meat.   Upon entering I was pleasantly surprised by the decor. The walls and front of the food line are covered in distressed wood that actually looks smoked itself. A nice touch! There are several tables for seating as well as a wood bench that runs the length of the dining room.  The menu has enough components that you will never run out of options. Hubby got a BBQ sampler with chicken, pork, and brisket. The chicken was his favorite. He chose rice and potato salad as his sides. I tried the brisket bowl on top of baked beans, topped with coleslaw. It was tasty but next time I'll order something on a tray. I'm a food separatist but I powered through and ate everything mixed together. I also ordered a side of Mac n cheese for $1.99.  Overall we were pleased with the meal and ambiance and we'll definitely be back!  Edited to add: four stars for food, the fifth added because of awesome customer service... and a clean bathroom that makes you feel as if you just walked into a saloon!"}
{"text":"Amazing macaroni and cheese. Perfectly smoked pulled pork. For delicious homemade barbecue sauce has choose from. Fresh baked beans made from scratch. You can get your food in a sandwich, Bowl, burrito, sampler or more"}
{"text":"Came to Pork on a Fork to feed a BBQ craving - the Yelp reviews were incredible, so our expectations were high.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with beans and sweet potato fries. There were also several sauces on the table to choose from, since the meat comes dry and without any sauce. Overall, I liked the pork, but having it soaked in the sauce initially would have probably tasted much better!  Overall, the food was decent, but I'm taking off two stars for the inside of the place. This restaurant and the seating area seemed very unclean to me, and I felt grimey even being in there.  A place can be casual and clean at the same time!"}
{"text":"Finally made it back for some tasty BBQ (it's 24 miles away for me). They were out of pulled pork and sausage and apparently we got the last of the brisket. I'm glad they still had my brisket or that would have been a long drive for nothing. I believe they were down to chicken and ribs. I got mac & cheese and potato salad for my sides and they were tasty. Lady behind the counter was on the phone asking customers if they wanted something else or to cancel their order. I'm sure they were disappointed because the food here is really good!"}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place long ago but it's 25 miles away, so I was waiting for a reason to go out that way. After seeing the good Yelp reviews and checking out their website, we finally decided to make the drive. It really is a hole in the wall that you probably wouldn't notice if you didn't know it was there. We actually drove past it and had to turn around to get back to it. The building is rather dark outside at night. But once inside, you fill up your drink first, then order at the counter, then pay. I got iced tea and a pulled pork sandwich with mac & cheese and beans. The staff was very friendly and the manager even comped our drinks since it was our first time. That was nice! It doesn't look like there's anywhere to sit and eat but you walk down the hall and there's a big dining area in the back. There were 4 different kinds of sauces on the tables. A sweet, a smoky, a spicy, and a mustard. I went with a combo of sweet & smoky. I liked it! I also tried some brisket from my b/f's sampler and it was really tender and good. The sides were also good, but could have been warmer. When my b/f went back to order more waffle fries (which were tasty) the manager asked how everything was and he mentioned the temperature of the sides. He said the water must be low and they would correct it. So it seems they genuinely want customer feedback to help put out quality food. That is appreciated. They also have BBQ Bowls and a BBQ Burrito on their menu which is different. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way home to pick-up some BBQ to go. I can't comment on the dinning service or dinning area, the take out area is separate.   The pulled pork was amazing! So tender and juicy. Just the right amount of flavor, and you can pick your own BBQ sauce.   The rack of ribs were melt in your mouth good! The meat was falling off the bone, so delicious. I wish we lived closer, this would be a weekly stop."}
{"text":"Located across from the Deer Valley airport.   Parking is labelled on the curb so be careful you're not parking in a spot that's designated for some of the surrounding businesses however there's still lots of parking available.  Staff are friendly, welcoming, and always willing to answer any questions.  The restaurant has character.  In front where you enter, you order either to-go or to dine in.  If you dine in, you take your food to the back along a corridor that has the restrooms to a garage that has been converted into a restaurant/sitting area.  There's no windows and the lights are bright.    The thing I didn't like was the fact the restrooms wasn't cordoned off from the main eating area.  In other words there were eating tables in the vicinity of the restroom door/area (-1).  When you enter, you get in line and order.  The menu is on the small side as it's on a flat screen TV (-1).  The food is prepared in front of you when you order, e.g. the brisket is cut in front of you, the pulled pork is mixed straight from the container and prepped in front of you, and the chicken is removed from the bone and prepped in front of you.  I had the Smokin' Sampler that comes with 2 sides, pulled pork, smoked chicken and a smoked sausage though you could substitute any meat for brisket for $1.49 extra so what I did was substitute the chicken for brisket.  I opted for the BBQ beans and coleslaw.    The brisket had a nice smokey flavor to it and was tender and juicy.  The pulled pork was also good, though perhaps a little on the dry side which wasn't a problem as I utilized some of their signature sauces they had in the back.  There are 4 sauces/bottles - mustard flavored, sweet & mild (my favorite), hot & spicy (which wasn't hot and spicy in my opinion), and a smoked tangy sauce (another favorite of mine).     The BBQ beans was well seasoned and some kick to it.  Their coleslaw was creamy, not watery, well seasoned, and crunchy.    Price for the Smokin' Sampler was $10.99 plus the $1.49 substitution which wasn't bad for lunch at all.    Portion sizes were good and didn't give that overstuffed feeling but filling."}
{"text":"No Onions...really...out of cornbread..out of pickles...Inventory needs to be addressed.  Skimpy on sauces and sides are small portions.  I actually liked the food but don't think its run well."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3 stars because of their customer service.  I've been to this place a few times, the food it's generally pretty good, the only thing I didn't like is their ribs; they are on the dry/burnt side. However, the rest of their meats and sides are really good. Meats are juicy, well portioned. The sides are homemade (most of them), my favorite are the mac n cheese and the macaroni salad. Their barbecue sauces are savory, spicy, tangy...really good.  The reason for the 3 stars: CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE. I ordered once through UBER eats, and the person at the counter messed up, and did not give one of the dinner plates to the driver. When the driver arrived at my house, I asked for the other plate, and he said; \"I specifically asked the girl if that was it, and she rudely replied \"yes, that's it\". So, while the driver was still at my house, I called the restaurant, I was placed on hold for a while, and finally they answered, the man I talked to said they gave everything to the driver, that he personally had given it to him, and to contact UBER. Luckily, the driver stayed w/ me for the entire talk, and he jumped in, told him that a GIRL was the one that had given him the order, not him, and to not lie about it; that's when the guy at the restaurant got nervous, and put the girl on the phone. The girl, still being rude, told the driver...ok, your order is here, come get it. UBER driver went to go get my order, brought it back, and told me that he was not paid for this extra drive, and that the \"kids working there had showed him some attitude\". Later that day, I got a call from the manager at the restaurant who apologized and offered me some credit for my next visit. Last week, I went in to use the credit, the restaurant was EMPTY, no customers, and 2 people behind the counter did not greet me, smile, and just stared at me. I approached them, and told him that I was there to get some credit for something that had happened in the past, still, nothing from them, no apology, nothing to make this experience better, one of them went to the back to check for my name on their list, and when he came back, he asked, \"what do you want?\". Again, the attitude was horrible, they were not rude, but honestly, no enthusiasm, I walked out of there feeling depressed. Again, the food was delicious, but the customer service is a disaster. I truly hope the owner/manager pays attention to that, because it could really bring down a restaurant...a GOOD restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here to day for the first time. It was kind of a drive for us coming from Wittmann, but we will definitely be making the drive again! We got the XL family feast. At first look we thought oh this won't be enough meat for the whole group of us. It not only was enough, but we had leftovers as well. Dinner tonight! yay  The huge sides, we got mac & cheese as one. It could have used a tad more salt. The coleslaw as our second side was on fire! :-) The baked beans we weren't to thrilled about, too much pepper for our taste. My favorite was the sausage & ribs. The pulled pork was a win with the kids, and the brisket well there wasn't any of it in our leftover box!  Fountain drinks were mixed perfect too. Pepsi products. The seating was a little confusing with not knowing where to sit. It's around the corner in the back of the place, but plenty of seating. The utensil dispensers were pretty cool too.     Anyways, it was clean. The people were super friendly, and yes you can tip them! There was a line, and it takes a moment to get your food so don't go for sit in if you are in a hurry, suggest calling ahead for their take out if that's the case. This food is not fast food, it is actually smoked with wood. (There were a few buckets of wood in the back we could see)    If we weren't looking for it we would have passed it, so look for the 1515 on the building, or their little sign they sat by the street. Plenty of parking. They were very familiar with their policies as well, none of that ho-hum what do we do stuff. Even though they were really busy, I saw some of the people making time to come into the dining area to clean and asked everyone at each table if they needed anything.    Thanks for making this a great Fathers Day for my husband, and Sons. See ya all again!"}
{"text":"Was out running errands and spotted this place with a \"Grand Opening\" sign so I thought I would give it a try. Ordered the beef brisket sandwich and they were out of a couple sides so I ended up with mac and cheese and waffle fries. Everything was pretty decent. The side containers for the beans and mac and cheese are pretty small while you get a pretty large portion of waffle fries, not sure why the disparity between the two. The sandwich was also pretty well loaded with meat and there didn't appear to be a lot of fat or funk on it, which is nice. The various BBQ sauces on the table were a good touch."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place!! My dad and I were addicted! We discovered POaF when they were just brand new. It USED to be incredible!!!  I notice I am not the only one who is recently complaining \"it ain't what it used to be\" by way of reviews here on Yelp.   I ordered ribs, brought them home and fed them to the dog! They were so tough I was afraid he might lose his teeth... Okay, just kidding about the dog losing his teeth, but not about the ribs being so tough that the dog got to eat them!!  Because we have always enjoys our meals, I gave it another try. I ordered the ribs and brought them home. Although the dog didn't get them this time, I was very disappointed because they were very, very tough again, but at least not as bad as the time before. I used a fork to tear the meat from the bone and you could actually HEAR the meat ripping from the bone!!! WTH???  There were a couple times when I arrived about 3:00 and they were out of ribs. I guess I got lucky since they have been so crappy lately!! They also have been out of beans, and on another occasion they were out of macaroni and cheese! They told me they were busy working on catering orders...  HOW oh HOW can a restaurant have it so right and lose it so BAD??? If you know how to do it so well, what happened??   I am writing this review in hopes the owners will see this and get it right again!!! If I see the reviews popping back in the favorable column, I will be happy to try it again and remove this review. Until I hear it is back to what it used to be, I will NOT return!!"}
{"text":"The absolute best pulled pork sandwich I ever had! Would drive again from North Scottsdale for their food! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Way good. Sumptuous, moist, smokey, perfectly seasoned brisket. Not sauced if you want a purist experience. Perfect portion, great sides (Mac n Cheese early in day the best). Simple surroundings and great service. Really friendly hot tattooed women serving. Must lunch spot for those beef lovers."}
{"text":"Missing items but fine whatever but OMG the dryest meat ever!  Mac and cheese is sub par no seasoning and the potatoe salad is gross!!  Bland,  dry,  and hard to swallow will never order again"}
{"text":"It pains me to leave this.. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE  the food. However,  took 4 coworkers with me for lunch today. After 30 minutes of watching the meat carver try to carve and weight meat for 5 people, we realized it was going to take about 30 more minutes for the next 10 people to be taken care before our chance. All 5 of us had to walk out. It's disappointing that the carver girl is that slow. If you get a new carver girl, we will be back and will recommend you! Get a new carver girl..please. We want to eat there!"}
{"text":"The Monster is BOMB!  1/2 pulled Pork 1/2 Brisket coleslaw hot BBQ jalapenos and pepper jack!  YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem and the food is real good. Make sure you make this a stop if you are in north Phoenix."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to the Camelback location and I was not disappointed! Its hard to find great BBQ in Phoenix and im so glad i finally found a spot. Five stars for their outstanding service and to die for BBQ. I recommend the pulled pork and the drool worthy mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp I found this BBQ spot the other day! Try the beef brisket with mac n cheese/baked beans combo and you won't be disappointed. Location is a bit tricky but when you find it you'll enjoy!"}
{"text":"My 1st visit was awesome. I got my food to go. Didn't know what to order so the guy suggested something with 3 meats and 2 sides. Cost was less than $16 and more than enough to feed 2 people. The meat was perfectly smoked and served with the sauce on the side. I ordered chicken,  beef brisket, and sausage with sweet potatoes fries and Mac and cheese. Food was great and I will go back as I work right across the street. Want to try the peach cobbler next time. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Got the 3 item combo with pulled pork, brisket, and pulled chicken with mac and cheese and a corn bread muffin as the sides. Also added 2 ribs for 4 bucks. Everything was fine but didn't taste that fresh. Went at about 6:30pm on a weekday, so maybe that had something to do with it. The meat wasn't all the moist and the ribs were a little tough. None of them had a deep smokey flavor either. The corn bread muffin also tasted kind of old. Mac and cheese was good."}
{"text":"Decent, fun place to go eat. The food is average for a good but not great bbq place. Service is always great and food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Tasty food and sides. Bun came not toasted but that's my fault for not asking. I discovered Pork on a Fork upon recommendations of friends who work across the street at Deer Valley airport. Per their experience and glowing reviews, I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which came with a choice of two sides. I chose the potato salad and the close slaw and I found both to be very tasty.  All came to $ 10.79 or so with a drink which I thought was quite reasonable. There is plenty of seating. The back area is a lot roomier and is much quieter and also boasts a large flat screen television.  Upon paying, you are given a number for your table so the server will know where to deliver the order.Service was very prompt - in fact,  I did not even have a chance to sit down as the server was already walking towards me with my order. Highly recommended! The staff was very friendly.  I had dreamed about the place all night since my friends had told me about it already knowing what  was going to order - I had caramelized onions in mind for  the sandwich and of course I walked in there completely forgetting what I had dreamed about. Next time!  ....I went back today (yep two days in a row) as I was intrigued as to how their burrito would taste. I got mine with chicken and pork in it, salsa, cheese and caramelized onions and sides of mac and cheese and potato salad. The food is good and the mac and cheese was absolutely to die for....but it could have been better...and that would start with toasting the bun if you get a sandwich or grilling the tortilla if you get their burrito...That little step alone would add giant leaps to the taste equation...I bet I could have asked but  didn't so shame on me again. At $ 9.29, the burrito is not exactly cheap but it is plenty of food however. POAF (Pork on a fork) would earn an additional star which would garner them five stars if they mastered the basics of toasting and grilling the bun and tortilla...No dinner for me tonight!"}
{"text":"Eating the Midwest monster with mac n cheese and sweet potato fries as I type this. I'm going back for dinner. Awesome meal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a restaurant.com coupon and decided to try this restaurant as it wasn't to far from the house!  We walked in and my first thought was this was just a small little place that was more for the businesses that were around it. After ordering and talking to other people that have been coming there for quite sometime we got a different vibe on the place.  We didn't have to wait long for our ribs and beef brisket which we chose bbq beans and coleslaw.  The sides were out of this world and extremely yummy.    But the meat....OMG!!!!  This restaurant was so good! Pork on a Fork is a hidden gem and we will be going back again.  The ribs...I'm sorry I cannot make them that good!  The meat was so tender and tasty.  The beef was so tender and just fell apart. None of the meat needed any additional sauce added to it because it was very good as it came.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. Customers were very happy there and lots of yums coming from many!   Worth the trip no matter what part of the valley you are in!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in AZ! The pulled pork is delicious and their sauces & beans are also fantastic.  Went there regularly but also used the catering service once - overall great experiences!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. The beef I ordered was FULL of fat (most of the dish was actually fat). I will post a picture later on of my dish as well. I'm hoping this is not nearly the best BBQ anywhere near Phoenix or it would be truly sad."}
{"text":"Summary: Great BBQ and friendly service! Great price as well. Would come back again.  Came here on Christmas Eve with a party of 7 around 1pm. This late in the afternoon the back dining room was closed but they accommodated us by bring chairs up for us to sit and eat. A lot of their patrons were take out orders which makes sense to me. They're forte was definitely the meats and not the ambiance of their restaurant.   Order at the counter and they'll pack up your meats in a styrofoam container or metal pan(if you get the big portions) to serve to you.  We got the family meal meant for 5 people and all 7 of us were adequately full but not stuffed.  Got the sweet potato and waffle fries as sides and they were very crispy!  All the meats were done very well and each of my family members had a different favorite. I personally loved the chicken because it had a strong peppery flavor."}
{"text":"Two stars for their service. The food was not good at all. I've been there twice. I thought I'd give them a second chance and try something else on the menu. I tried the sampler with chicken, smoked sausage and tri tip. Mac and cheese and Cole slaw on the side. The only good thing was the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, was impressed, even my 11 yr old daughter liked it and it is hard to find something she likes, so we will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"So...went here with a buddy tonight to get some grub.  Turned out to be just ok.    I scoped out their menu online a few days before and noticed that they had chicken wings as an appetizer.  There was an asterisk that comes with them though.  They only have them \"when available\", or if you order them 24 hours in advance.  I called them up Wed night and placed my order for a pound ($10.95).  I picked up my wings and also tried to order a 1/4 lb of brisket.  They told me they could only do 1/2 lb....why?  I don't know and didn't ask.  So a pound of wings, 1/2 lb of brisket ($10.00!) and a drink ran me almost $ 25.00.  Paid them my money, took my stuff and went to the room in the back.  The place is set up weird IMO...it's a counter in the front, then you have to walk to a back room to eat.  It feels like they are 2 separate buildings.  Their floors were slippery too btw...grease?   Anyways....on to the food.  Brisket-  Eh...just ok.  It was chunked brisket and almost more like burnt ends.  It was smoked properly and you could see the red smoke ring etc.  I took a bite and I got the \"pot roast\" taste.  Maybe I just don't like brisket as much as the next guy?  I will find out for sure when I go to Texas next May :-).  For the price of $10.00 for a 1/2 lb, it was a bit pricey.  Hell....Franklin BBQ in Austin only charges $17.00 a pound and that's considered the best in the world.   This was $ 20.00 a lb and I didn't even think it was that great.  Oh well.  Chicken Wings-  First of all, nobody has reviewed these things or uploaded a picture of them.  Until now.......The wings were plentiful.  They gave me a whole tray full of wings and it seemed way over a pound.  Maybe I got hooked up?  For $10.95 it's a great deal.  The wings were alright.  They were smoked properly and tasted pretty good.  I didn't add any sauce because of my low carbing but some sauce may have improved them a bit.  Since they were smoked and weren't grilled or fried, they did come out a bit soggy.   Not bad though and I would get them again for sure!   Overall this place was just ok.  I would get the wings again but not the brisket.  Service was ok...a tad too \" chill\" and laid back though but whatever.   They were youngsters and they were nice at least.  It was getting close to closing too so I bet they were anxious to get the hell out of dodge.  Will I be back?  Yeah, probably.  It is right near work and does fit my low carb diet options.  I will be on the lookout for better BBQ in Phoenix though.  A OK for now.  3 stars."}
{"text":"This is the best bbq I can say I've ever eaten in the valley.  It could go up against some of the best BBQ joints in the US. I'm talking places all throughout Texas, Memphis, etc.  I had the 2 meat platter w/Beef Brisket & Pulled Chicken.  The meats are so tender, perfectly seasoned & cooked that you don't even need BBQ sauce; but the BBQsauce is also amazing and adds a lil pop & dimension to the flavor profile of the perfectly flavored meats.  The sides were also not your typical quick, thrown together sides like most places which use prepackaged, bagged & bottled ingredients.  I had the Mac & Cheese - no question that this is homemade (awesomely creamy & perfectly cheesy, not overwhelming-just perfect) & for my 2nd side I had coleslaw. I was totally & absolutely pleasantly surprised. The Coleslaw was also homemade, not bagged cabbage (it was freshly, hand chopped) & mixed w/a homemade, fresh & excitingly flavorful dressing of delightful perfection (not too thick & creamy, yet not too watered down, either - finally after all these yrs ... I've found a coleslaw that has a perfect balance in the dressing consistency, a perfect flavor profile & is made w/fresh, hand chopped cabbage & I can finally say that it's the best slaw I've ever eaten).  My spouse had a full rack of baby back ribs which he couldn't stop raving about.  Ate the entire rack in 1 setting. The meat literally just fell right off the bones.  If you're on the North side of Phx- - -trust me when I say this is a Restaurant you MUST visit.  It will NOT disappoint."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by stating I'm from Memphis and I am a BBQ snob... this is by far the best BBQ that I have found in the Valley.  Service was awesome and Jake even had the perfect music playing!  Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ .. Got lb of brisket and lb of pulled pork. Staff is friendly and food was solid. I did call in order 40 minutes ahead to avoid wait and wasn't ready but they handled it quick. Will be back."}
{"text":"HOLY SMOKES! Literally!   My love of smoked meats runs deep...ingrained and woven into my DNA.  Recently several Yelp friends had sung the praises of their offerings.  It's now my turn to stand up and sing.  After seeing their booth at the Wednesday evening Downtown PHX Market I hoped they would return for the Saturday market.  When I arrived on Saturday, they were there with warmers filled with fresh pulled smoked pork, smoked beef brisket and numerous frozen pork treats.  Their pulled pork and brisket was smoked to perfection, tender and amazing. Their  original brat was fresh and juicy. I also purchased a breakfast package that included sausage (links and patties) and it was supposed to include bacon but they were out that day and I replaced with sliced deli ham.    Since my first visit I continue to go back to their stand on Saturdays for a brisket sandwich. I also picked up some pulled pork to take with me to a superbowl party. It was a welcome addition to the wonderful spread at the gathering.    (2/15) Just last week I picked up some bacon that I have not cooked up yet but look forward to it.    I hope to one day stop into their shop in N. Phoenix."}
{"text":"I used to come here when they first opened and love the place but maybe I've changed because this place just doesn't fit me any more.  My last beans did seem to have any brisket in it the last time I came and that was my favorite thing here (always doubled up beans as my side).  I guess it's time for me to move on and I found another bbq place for me now.  I guess I have a new taste now.  Sorry, it's not you it's me."}
{"text":"I'm a health nut but I will indulge on some POAF!"}
{"text":"Nice interior newer sibling to the deer valley location, got the pulled pork, the sausage, and the brisket with nice outer bark to it. All meats were nicely smoked and just delicious, for the sides had cornbread, great  bbq beans, and crunchy slaw. Love the spicy BBQ sauce"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! I got brisket which was delicious, as were the sweet potato fries and the potato salad. The flavor of the beans wasn't quite what I expected and were my least favorite part, but the brisket more than made up for it! There were multiple sauce options at the table and the two that we tried were really good. The seating area is tucked in the back and is quaint and quiet.  As others have said, the staff moves pretty slowly and seemed a little unorganized at times. We weren't in a hurry so it was no big deal.  Overall, we really enjoyed it and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My rating is based off the food and service inside the building.  If we could rate based off of parking and accessibility to the building the overall rating would be lower.  However, those are issues that are not directly related to this restaurant so I will only focus on the food and service.  I didn't know this place was featured on the Official Best BBQ of Arizona shown on the Discovery Channel.  I just found it via Bing Maps because my belly was hungry!  :)  The food was awesome. I ordered the Smokin Sampler with all 4 meats.  Because I love meat and I can.  :)  I used the Crazy J's sauce with was very spicy and great taste.  Everything was great, the polish sausage, the pulled pork, the chicken, and the brisket.    Now, I will not be going back soon, not because of the food but because of the parking.  This is something out of their control.  There is always catering.  :)  They are in an industrial park type of complex.  The parking spots are small for normal sized cars but trying to park my normal sized F-150 was not easy.  When I came out, the person next to me wasn't as careful getting in as I was getting out.  I left with great food and a good ding on the side of my truck right in the sport where their driver side door would of hit.  The line inside was long but moved fast.  The ladies that worked the front line all friendly and did a great job."}
{"text":"Great BBQ joint in North Phoenix. Ample portions, reasonable prices, fast service."}
{"text":"After being prodded months by my co-workers to try this place, i finally did.  Here goes: I walk in and there are 2 blank TV screens above the counter. The staff is waiting for me to order something, but after an uncomfortably long pause by both sides, I finally had to say, \"is there supposed to be a menu up there or something?\" - Strike One.  After they realize its not working, they spend several minutes trying to fix this, but since I only have an hour for lunch, I find a paper menu and begin to narrow down my selections. I go with some type of BBQ chicken sandwich (BBQ being key here as sauce is implied in BBQ) and the beans as a side. The beans were great.  So before I go any further, let me just say that I was expecting at least some type of base BBQ sauce with the meat. This was not the case and since it was not explained to me (- Strike Two), I only grabbed one tiny cup of some sweet BBQ sauce and took my meal to go.  Naturally, the tiny cup of BBQ sauce was not enough, and my sandwich was very bland and dry. In addition, I was expecting shredded chicken not small pieces that were maybe 1 1/2 inch by a 1/4 inch dropping all over the place but what landed the 3rd Strike was that this sauce tasted like nothing more than corn syrup and liquid smoke. Strike Three - I'm out!  I may try it again, but I will know next time to stock up on some other sauce (there were 3 or 4 to choose from) and go with the Pork or Beef instead.  BTW- The parking really sucked since its in an industrial park and is shared with many other businesses."}
{"text":"OMG. We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. My husband loves BBQ Ribs, so I decided to have his bday here. The place is super clean and I like the layout of the place and the food is just amazing. I ordered the sample platter that came with, brisket, chicken, sausage with two sides which I picked the Mac and cheese and coleslaw. AMAZING. My husband of course got the Ribs. AMAZING. Everyone at our table loved there food. I think what makes this place really stand out from other bbq spots is there sauces. It's like liquid gold. Besides the delicious food, the staff and management is super friendly and they made my husbands birthday perfect. Highly recommend this place. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is my husbands absolute favorite place in the whole wide world. The Resturant is in a heavily industrial location. It's just not in a regular Restaurant. Anyways you walk in and the place smells AMAZING. You get in line, kind of like cafeteria style and you give them your order and they put it together right their and hand it to you and you pay. Then you go to the back where you will find seating. You can sit anyplace you want and eat. The seating area looks like a garage that has been converted to a restaurant. So the place is not fancy at all. It actually took me a couple of times going their to warm up to the place. But let's get down to the real reason we go their. Their BBQ is Fantastic. And their sauces are delicious. My husband normally gets the half rack ribs and I get the sampler and we sort of share. The portion sizes are huge. Lots of different side options to pick from and they are all good."}
{"text":"The food is decent but it is a little pricey for the quality. I've come to expect that with this place, very skimpy on the portion sizes. When someone who spends the amount of money that We do at this restaurant asks for extra bbq sauce the restaurant should oblige. You will not keep customers by being a cheapskate with the sauce. You can always add an option on UberEATS for people to purchase extra sauce if need be but for Pete's sake stop acting like jerks always ignoring the request. There are other options for bbq in the area!"}
{"text":"Born and raised in a Texas BBQ restaurant, I do competitions myself. So I have a decent handle on BBQ.  I came at 545, which being fair is a tough time. They prob just pulled a shoulder and brisket off letting it sit before slicing for dinner service. Because of this I gave them the benefit of the doubt on the dryness of the pulled pork and brisket.  You can tell they know what they are doing though. It's just there was no flavor profile on either, but a dry piece of meat is tough to recognize the spices or smoke...  Good meat doesn't need sauce, but this needed some due to dryness. The sweet and mild was the only good one, the mustard heavy was good with the pork for the tangy element.  I come this way once a year to Honeywell, I think it's worth giving them a shot again though."}
{"text":"hallelujah- there is some pork up here in the north(kinda)west valley!  My favorite thing about this place is that you can buy the pork by the pound.  I think it's about $14, which sounds a bit spendy, but it is worth it.   The sandwiches are amazing.  If you are in the area and want a hefty lunch- you gotta go to Pork on a Fork!"}
{"text":"Great stop for lunch. I had the pork sandwich, mac n cheese and waffle fries. The meat was tender and the 3 choices of BBQ sauce were all delicious!"}
{"text":"Pork on a Fork is great BBQ! Their hot BBQ sauce tastes amazing on everything.  By far, the ribs are the best followed by the pork and chicken. The brisket is good, but I have definitely had better.'  The baked beans have pork in them and are delicious, but the mac and cheese and coleslaw are the best two sides.   Great, casual place. Strange set up, but overall yummy! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent place...  parking is a little difficult since the coffee shop next door feels they need the majority of the spaces for their empty shop...  The pork is extremely tender and very flavorful. The bbq beans have a very unique smoky flavor.  I couldn't get enough!  So far I have been here three times, and it's ROCKED every time...   Keep up the awesome work!"}

They've now added several menu items, including brats in many flavors, seasoned waffle fries and sweet potato fries.    While finishing up our HUGE sandwich of smoky, porky goodness, the owner invited Daren and I over to taste a sample of a new HOT sauce he was developing (in response to customer comments, of course). It was tangy and had a nice smokiness and a bit more heat than the other sauces.  Looking forward to a final version on the tables, but I have to recommend these midwesterners get out and sample more of what this part of the country considers a baseline as far as Scoville units!  8^ )  ... going back to work in a Hickory/Mesquite cloud gave them some great free advertising.

Flag this comment  1 Previous Review: Hide »     11/24/2010  Reviewing their food for the first time at their new restaurant location in far north phoenix (Deer Valley Airport only USED TO be the boonies), but i've been hearing about their meat for some time now.  A delicious smoky aroma gently smacks you around and lulls you into submission once you enter.  A simple menu offers the lunch selection (soon to offer breakfast too). I knew i wanted pulled pork as an entree, and honestly didn't notice what else they had.    The usual side offerings of beans, potato salad, and coleslaw never appeal to me, personally.  I don't fault them for that, but a pickle spear being my only other available side left me feeling less than satiated.  Maybe some french fries, or at least chips?    The pulled pork sandwich had a nice smoky flavor, and the meat was juicy without being fatty.  The bun was simply generic.  Maybe these guys could get into cahoots with a local baker to put their special meat on something a little more worthy?    The sauces offered were \"Sweet Mild\" (which was both) and \"Hog Wild Hot\" (which was neither, but still tasty).  Both had a distinct molasses sweetness in a thick tomatoey base, the Hot with a little more spice flavor to it, but not much heat at all.  The atmosphere is simple and clean.  Ribs, breakfast, and \"Swine & Dine\" nights are on the way, according to the owners. Look forward to many more days of coming back to work smelling like a meat smoker !"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best BBQ you'll ever eat.  The meat is very tender and melts in your mouth.  The two sides I had- Mac n' Cheese and beans were also very good.  This place is very unassuming and somewhat tough to find since it's in an industrial park, but a great restaurant nonetheless.  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with this place. After looking at their menu, pictures and reviews my husband and I were really excited to eat here. But that quickly changed upon walking in, I ordered online and went straight to the register and was ignored by the two working be the counter, one was talking to other customers, putting their meal together so that I get, but the other guy wasn't. I just stood there feeling dumb for about 5 minutes before the lady working the register came up. This was our first time ordering Pork on a Fork, ordered online and assumed the BBQ sauce just came with the meal, the girl working the check out was new and forgot to ask what BBQ sauce we wanted, disappointing upon getting home, but was just going to remember for future visits. Then I tried my bowl...the rice was undercooked and crunchy, BBQ sauce was not added to the bowl, and that was on the instructions when I ordered and the meat was on the dry side. I ordered the pork slider for my daughter and was given the brisket (I won't complain about that because the brisket was REALLY good) but annoyed with the fact the order was wrong. And my husband got cornbread as a side, the size and taste was laughable. Overall, not satisfied. IF we ordered from here again it would only be the brisket in bulk!"}
{"text":"They forgot about our sweet potato fries while we sat there looking stupid. A worker, was staring at my wife like we were deer in headlights. So 30 minutes after sitting and waiting for our fries we lost our appetite at the service and asked to speak to the manager, a young lady assumed the position of manager and said she would talk to the male worker about his conduct. I ate my dry and cold pulled pork and my wife threw hers away, my toddler ate the fries on the drive home not really caring. This was 5 months ago, maybe they are better now."}
{"text":"Ordered from Uber Eats so I didn't knew what to expect but I had high hopes....  Paid $30 for 2 sandwiches that were pretty small, didn't even order 2 sandwiches, but at least the brisket was good. Me and a co-worker decided to go in  and expect whatever came to us. When it arrived I was initially confused because we got 2 sandwiches when that wasn't what I ordered, at least that's not what I thought I ordered. In both the app and on their menu online is describes the Midwest Monster as a \"heaping pile of Brisket\" topped with slaw, cheese, and jalapenos when that's not what it is. Its a small brisket sandwich jalapenos and cheese. I was pretty disappointing because I didn't want a sandwich and if I wanted one I would've ordered a brisket sandwich.  So if you're ordering the Midwest Monster beware because you'll be upset that you got a sandwich like I did and not a pile of delicious meat. My other complaint is that they we're the smallest sides I've ever seen. I ate my Mac & Cheese in 2 bites and although the cornbread was good the same holds true true the size. The sandwich isn't even that big. For paying $10 for a brisket sandwich, 2 sides and $3 more just for jalapenos and cheese is upsetting.  Too bad because it's close to my house but probably never go there ever. Now I know. Please fix your menu description and your app description."}
{"text":"We've been to Pork on a Fork numerous times.  Because we love their pulled pork sandwich, we always ordered that.  Well, this time we tried the baby back ribs.  They were absolutely delicious!  Very meaty, and the meat fell off the bone with the tenderness.  What a dilemma now;  what to order when we go back!  If you go, don't forget to order their sweet potato fries.  The best ever!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent value, good food and good service. Was happy to learn it's also owned by nebraskans...so that made my heart happy. We found it while my brother was in town from Nebraska and were looking for good bbq that didn't cost a fortune. They satisfied all our needs."}
{"text":"i have no idea if the food is any good. didn't get a chance to try it. but, did waste an hour and a half of my day trying to try it. the place isn't close to home but wanted to give it a shot and drove there. waited in line for another 15 minutes only to find out they were out of everything but chicken and sausage.... on a tuesday night. what? couldn't they put a sign by the door telling us they were out of all the good stuff and we could cut our losses there without waiting in line? what a crappy way to treat potential new customers."}
{"text":"Best BBQ burrito ever try it with beans, cheese, waffle fries (ask for the ends) and either pork or brisket is good I prefer brisket but it does cost a little more."}
{"text":"I'm lucky enough to have a new job that is a 4 minute drive from here, I made the first of many lunch trips here today. I got a BBQ combo platter and it is seriously the best thing ever. I have tried other BBQ places in town and while they're good too, this is amazing! Juicy pork with tons of flavor, delectable chicken, and because I'm going all out for you, fellow yelpers, i upgraded to brisket for the 3rd option and its AMAZING.   I got the Mac n Cheese because well, we're going big here today, and the cole slaw. So much flavor, so tasty. I seriously love everything and the price isnt too bad, after all I have plenty for dinner here as well. It all comes with no sauce and then you can add whatever you like, I got a couple options to try out and, you guessed it, they are awesome too smokey sweet, tangy, spicy - whatever you like.   My only concern here is how big my obsession will grow...time to buy a gym membership for the sole purpose of eating here as often as possible! :)"}
{"text":"Pork on a Fork has been on my radar for a while after reading a fellow Yelper's review. Once again Yelp did not let me down. I don't get to Phoenix often as I live in the east valley, but today I had an appointment just blocks from here. My wife and I decided to stop in for a late lunch . We quickly spotted the POF van from Camelback. After a little searching we found the store on the back side of the mall. At some point you could just follow your nose to the source of the smoky BBQ aroma. Upon entering you are you are greeted with a slow bluesy background music. The place is clean and trendy with plenty of tables.  They must have thought we were nuts, because the first thing we did was to post a selfie by the POF sign in order to claim the 25% off coupon you get when you check in on Yelp. The wait staff greeted us warmly and took our orders. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the highly recommended mac-n-cheese and baked beans for sides. I watched with anticipation as they carefully assembled my sandwich. A generous portion of pulled pork heaped on a fresh baked bun. I wish they would have thrown a couple sliced pickles on as well. One thing you must keep in mind, this pulled pork is not cooked in sauce. If you expect saucy BBQ pork, this is not it. What you get is tender, smoky, juicy slow cooked pork shoulder. There are 4 different amazing sauces to drown your sandwich in at your table.  The mac-n-cheese was fantastic. It was very cheesy, and had a bit of a zing to it. I think it may have been made with sharp cheddar. There was a seasoning sprinkled on top which was the perfectly complimented the dish. The macaroni was cooked perfectly, not sticky, not mushy. I could make this my main course and both sides also. It was truly the best mac-n-cheese I've ever had. The baked beans were good. They were even better with a little spicy BBQ sauce mixed in.  Jake came out to chat with us for a while. He gave us a little history of POF. I told him this was a place Guy Fiere would like. This is just the kind of place he would feature on Drive-ins, Diners, and Dives. Although the food was impressive what impressed me most is Justin's personal response to most of the Yelp posts. This tells me he cares about Yelpers. It's this kind of personal touch that scores POF a spot on my Outstanding Service list."}
{"text":"Had the Midwest Monster. Loved it. They put the sides in these small aluminum cups and I thought it wouldn't be enough. These small aluminum cups use Mary Poppins purse technology as my side of BBQ beans kept on giving."}
{"text":"Had sample platters cause hey life is all about choices. We loved the chicken, the sausage was ok,  the brisket was pretty good, pulled pork ya ok alright. Waffle fries two thumbs up. The sauces are bomb a little regional sampling from the big BBQ kings in the states. The mustard one was killer. I was not a huge fan of max and cheese need to pep up the flavor on that a bit. All in all I will say this it tastes pretty good and the place is wicked clean so ya I'll be back and hey saving 25% on our first try all good stuff."}
{"text":"Seriously... my favorite BBQ place. There isnt one thing that ive had on the menu that i didnt like  The pulled pork and the ribs are my favs"}
{"text":"I just want to shout out this place! We came right at closing and we thought we were out of luck. We both had a long day and were frustrated because we were looking forward to BBQ. While we were outside trying to figure out where else to get food, A very sweet and respectful employee named Alundis came out and invited us in. He was so respectful and we couldn't have been more grateful. The team took care of us and made our night!! Not only is this food so BOMB, the customer Service was top notch! Thanks So much"}
{"text":"A-OK.   We are on a mission to find the best BBQ in the valley and this was the first place we went.  We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, Chicken plate and some bones to try the ribs, because, after all it is a BBQ place and you have to get pulled pork and ribs.  The pulled pork was good. Nothing that really stood out to be special and the meat was kind of dry. I wish they would have put some sort of sauce on the meat prior to serving (they have different sauces in pumps for you to pick and choose) but since they let you pick which kind of sauce and how much, I guess it makes sense.  Chicken plate consisted of two chicken breasts and some sides. Waffle fries are generic with a cajun seasoning, baked beans were alright, honestly they looked like mush and the flavor was ok. Chicken was good though. Good seasonings and very tender.  The thing that saved the meal were the ribs. Ribs were pretty good! Tender (not falling off the bone tender) and came with some sort of light glaze which was much better than any of the sauces.   I would have given this 3.5 stars if I could but since I don't think I'll ever crave/have the desire to comeback, it gets a three."}
{"text":"Food is alright.  The smoke flavor is Intense.  Almost overwhelming by the end of the Meal.  Space is limited But i know they are expanding.  Sides are great, Prices are a little high.    Overall i'll come back but need to br craving it.  That smoke flavor can get a little bland by the end of the meal.  However to each there own"}
{"text":"It definitely lived up to the expectations of being a upper echelon BBQ joint. I ordered the BBQ Pork plate with waffle fries and beans and was not disappointed. I actually forgot to pour their BBQ sauce on the pork until i was almost halfway through with the meal. It was that tasty, I would say if your in that neck of the woods, POAF is the place to go. The service was very prompt and I even used a Yelp deal to score a free 24 oz drink. Overall, they get my highest recommendation.   BBQ pork, beans, waffle fries and an Arnold Palmer... doesn't get much better then that!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  We weren't sure what to expect since the restaurant is in an office building plaza.  Kinda weird, but the employees in the other businesses are lucky!  We went in here on a whim after reading all the awesome Yelp reviews.  Our first impression was a girl at the front and she was super nice and didn't rush us while we were checking out the menu options.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni & cheese and my husband ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans.  He also ordered a side of ribs to sample.  The wait wasn't too bad -- it took about 10 or 15 minutes and it was ready to go.  They are cool with their sauce and let you fill up the small plastic cups and take as much as you want of it (which is awesome, because the sauce tastes SO good!).   It's a nice, thick sauce and they have several flavors to choose from.  We go to a nearby area to have a little picnic by ourselves and notice that they forgot to include the side of ribs.  We pack everything up and go back to get those.  The employees were really nice about it and apologized and gave my husband the side of ribs.  We repeat the same process and realize that they also messed up my husband's order and gave him a pulled pork sandwich instead of the brisket sandwich.  We decide to let it go and eat our food.  The pulled pork has great flavor.  The meat actually tastes like it has been smoked for several hours and is good enough to eat on its own without any sauce.  However, we weren't going that route, because the sauce is too damn good not to eat.  The baked beans and macaroni & cheese were not anything special, but they were good.  The ribs were our favorite part!  We absolutely loved them.  Very tender and the sauce they chose to slather them in was delicious.  This place is pretty far from where we live, but we would definitely go out of our way (again) to eat here more."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ place. Interesting concept as you can order your meat in a burrito, bowl, etc."}
{"text":"The meat is great. The options are great. The mac is great. The fires are great. The management is great. Absolute favorite local spot. Give them your business!"}
{"text":"I want to make sweet love to their beans!!!!  PoaF is a very small place that is easily missed. But, take the time to find it and you will be VERY happy! The prices are reasonable and the portions are large. we have gone to Dillion's for years and like it very much, but PoaF is the real deal. The brisket has a black char on the outside- just as it should. The sweet potato fries are thick and full of flavor. And the beans.... So much flavor and large chunks of pork in them........  Go! Now! Run!!   Update......  And now they have thick, rich, creamy mac and cheese!!!!!!  Run faster!!! Now!!"}
{"text":"Second time here. Have sampler the first time it was very good got half rack of ribs this time some of the best ribs I have ever had. Great job guys keep up the good work and open up one in Scottsdale. Very fresh have great sides and 4 different sauces to choose from. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. This was my second visit and it was as yum as I remember it. Both times I had the combo which was pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket. My two sides were coleslaw and tossed salad. The servers were super welcoming and helpful. The dining area was clean and well stocked. Great spot for groups, meetings or family outings."}
{"text":"POAF certainly does deserve to be called the best in the valley! Their menu items certainly offer a variety of wonderful choices. Their barbecue is unlike any other and really stands out from the rest. If you ever feel like dining in, Pork On A Fork is the way to go. Also, shoutout to the worker in the Monster Energy hat. He is very friendly and sure knows how to make the best burrito!"}
{"text":"Got myself the pulled pork sandwich. Meat was excellent quality and with just the right amount of tenderness vs chew. Sauces were excellent as were the sides. Definitely a keeper this place."}
{"text":"Kinda of a dump of a restaurant, but the food is great. Kind of tucked in the industrial park and little available parking, but I will go again. Some of the best BBQ around."}
{"text":"The BBQ isn't bad, but I cannot give POAF a positive review. They charged me $28.00 for a pound of brisket, with no sides. This is about 40% higher than even the most expesive I have seen. For example, the better Bryan's BBQ in Cave Creek, about 10 miles away, charges $13.95 for a pound.   The sauce here is good, have several different flavors, all of which I liked. The sandwiches are good as well, although slightly pricey at $10-$12 dollars with waffle fries. The ribs, while not bad are not really the best. I think it's the way they slice and serve them.   When POAF first opened they put forth a better effort, but upon their subsequint success they seem to have become a little complacent, and a tad greedy.  Hopefully over time they will find a better price balance, appreciate thier customers and become the great place to eat that they should be."}
{"text":"5 stars for their ribs.  The to go rack comes pre-sauced which surprised me. I was disappointed at first, but once I tried them at home, they were delicious that way.  I usually got them dry rubbed when ordering. The default is with the sauce now.   And, when ordering ahead, they do not start preparing. You have to tell them to start now to have it ready when you arrive. This is the default, not to start the order until you wait in line there and order again. That makes no sense to me.  The brisket is usually very moist and juicy. Last time it was dry and tougher. The pork was consistently drier than I am used to for BBQ pork.  So I don't get it anymore there. The chicken is very tasty and I love the smoke flavor it has. But the pieces are tiny and you only get 1 thigh in the combination.  The sausage is average, not bad, not great.  They moved the sauces to the back room, and for a whole rack of ribs I only get 2 tiny to go cups of sauce. What the heck?  Really, you people (at POAF) would make due if you had a whole rack of ribs and only 2 tiny cups of sauce????  Moving the sauces to the back makes it more inconvenient to get more to go. Don't know why they are so stingy with the sauces for to-go.  Free drink when you check in on Yelp.  It used to be super hot and muggy in the back room. Now that it is their only room, the temperature is much better.  TV's back there. None on the news. All on sports. Lame.  It is very pricey here for lunch.  Drink and a plate runs you about $10-$13."}
{"text":"Go get you some crazy good bbq here there is not one bad thing on the menu. I am now craving there food again. YUM!"}
{"text":"Average at best. Me and my fiancé are trying out different BBQ food joints to cater our wedding and this one is dead last. We tried the sample platter for $15 (small portion). The chicken was very dry, the pulled pork had literally no flavor, and the best part was the brisket which had some moisture and flavor. The sauces again are poor to average. The mustard sauce, spicy sauce, and smoked sauce were all strange tasting, their normal sweet bbq sauce was their best, and again, it was average. This place is definitely good enough to have a quick bite to eat and enjoy some average BBQ but it IS NOT STELLAR. I don't understand all this hype as if this is killer BBQ, it's not."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their food the brisket is fantastic I just wish the employees seemed happy to be there other than that love the place"}
{"text":"Holy smokes this place is awesome! There pulled meats are to die for. And their mac n cheese is the best thing I've had all year! Love love love it!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time today and loved it.  I had the 1/2 rack of ribs with beans and mac and cheese.  The ribs were meaty and delicious and not too fatty.  The mac and cheese was excellent with a complementary smoky flavor.  I like how fast it was served too!  I can honestly say I was in hog heaven...lol!"}
{"text":"Okay this is an update;   A.  They have put some money into redoing the building to make it look better--a good sign. B.  The problem is most of the BBQ meat has NOT been smoked..without sauce most just tastes like regular meat, especially the pork. C.  A friend of mine gave me some Value Alliance card money to spend there-they took it at the deer valley location, but not at the central Phoenix location which I thought was odd--I live next door to the latter--had to drive all the way to deer valley... D.  I will continue to eat there--but they need to smoke the meat more. E. By the way they hire min wage teenagers who look nasty and don't want to be there--they need to hire some older more pro staff who know what they are doing I think"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Phoenix thats for for sure! The smokiness and melt in mouth BBQ keeps you longing for more. I can't wait to cater our Super Bowl Party and share the love with friends."}
{"text":"Maybe I am spoiled since I grew up in the Midwest and had access to great barbecue on almost every corner, but I am not impressed with the barbecue here.  We've ordered at least 10 times over the last year and the chicken is usually dried out and the beef has little taste.   The only thing that I would consider half way decent is the pulled pork. The dine in area is usually fairly dirty, it doesn't look like the owners pay much attention to it.      The Phoenix area suffers from a dearth of good barbecue,  this place is average at best. It won't remind you of home."}
{"text":"I can no longer recommend coming to this once great place.. Everything that made this stand apart  ( in a good way) is now gone..  It has been declining for so time now, however I have been holding hope that it would turn back around. ..  Today is the final nail in the coffin for me...  This was the worst lunch I have had in years..  Literally not one part of my meal was enjoyable. .. not even the coke (now RC ) or the use to be always great cornbread. ..  The old bland beans has no flavor (other than pepper ) and the ribs so over cooked that they were more like hard tack"}
{"text":"Great place to go after the car and quad passed emissions sweet potato fries rock baby ribs yoummy"}
{"text":"The portions are not very big for the price. The meats were okay - tried the brisket and the pulled pork and both tasted solid but not anything special. I did enjoy the sides - the cornbread muffin and mac and cheese were both pretty good; unfortunately there wasn't a whole lot of either. The mustard sauce was also pretty good, so be sure to ask for that when you're here."}
{"text":"What a disaster.  I had the delux combined pork, beef, chicken sampler... cold all, dry. Service station messy. Only item that was hot were the beans... and somehow this is the best in phx.... No Chance....will not return."}
{"text":"I went for my first time today. I loved it a bit of a wait, and in fact while I was in line the line tripped out the door, very popular place! I got the pulled pork with a side of Mac & Cheese and  Baked Beans.  It's an assembly line kind of set up.  I got the food to go so can't comment on the atmosphere. The pork was good, a little dry but good portion amount. I've had BBQ at Dickey's and it's been super fatty- this was not the case at all at Pork on a Fork.   The mac & cheese reminds me of Picaddillys if any of you are from the south. The backed beans were really good, and I'm not even a baked beans kind of gal!  I used the sweet tangy bbq sauce and really liked it- very tangy and they gave me tons of sauce cups full of it to go!   It was good!"}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue!   I order the mixed meat burrito every time. Great food all around!"}
{"text":"I am not sure where to start other than the positive.  We were greeted with a well informed and friendly young lady at the register. The menu is small which I like, so ordering was a breeze. The waffle fries are tasty and so is the mac n cheese. This is where I will part with the positive.   I ordered along with my daughter the pulled pork sandwich. Half of which (i'm kicking myself for the lack of picture) was fat. Not fat and lots of meat but straight up disgusting slimy fat that I had to pick out. Gross! The bun was mushy and so was half of the salvaged meat. The texture was terrible. I added 2 ribs for $2.99 and they were not even worth commenting on. My husband wanted to eat the rest of them and I was more then happy to share the ribs with out the warning. The look of disgust on his face might have been worth the trip. ;) Don't get the ribs or the pulled pork!!   The sauce selection was... sweet and gross, smokey and tangy (which I preferred) and spicy. Overall bad taste to the sauces. My young daughter couldn't even eat the sweet mild one as the taste was bad. She is a typical picky eater but this will be the first BBQ she wouldn't eat.   The brisket is ok...and I mean ok. I am not a fan of sausage but my hubby said it was amazing. So if you are going to check out this joint my suggestion would be sausage, waffle fries and mac n cheese.   Also...what kind of BBQ place does not have fresh brewed tea?? This is a first for me and a big disappointment. Make fresh brewed tea!!!   I love BBQ... a lot and I am shocked by these reviews. I hope I was just there on a bad night or something. I am all for local business and I hate chain restaurants...so I was pretty disappointed as I found myself wishing I was at Shane's rib shack down the road."}
{"text":"It's a decent bbq place for the area. There really isnt many other options close by. They have a pretty good bbq burrito, but the prices are pretty steep for what you get."}
