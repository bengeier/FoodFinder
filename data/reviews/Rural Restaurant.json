{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch set meals!

Haven't been here awhile cause my Western coworkers are picky.  I usually come with my Filipino coworker.  Just like previous review.  There's great deals on breakfast meals all day!  

My favourites are Pork and Chinese Preserved Vegetable on Vermicelli Noodles and Satay Beef on Vermicelli.  Meal includes coffee/tea (additional $0.75 for cold drinks), eggs, ham, and buttered toast.  Their daily lunch set menu includes soup and drink for $6.99.  Portion is huge and we usually share for variety.

Today, we ordered Cantonese Chow Mein (my coworker's favourite) without even ordering.  The waitress knows her order by heart.  Knows her drink is Hong Kong style ice tea and brings a plate of hot sauce.  That's great service!  I ordered Black Pepper Pork Chop with cream soup and Hong Kong style ice tea.  Everything was delicious as usual!"}
{"text":"Ughz. A bunch of my friends really like to come here by default because it is cheap and a sit down place.  I really don't get it.  Everything is so sloppily made here.  If I want instant noodles or vermicelli in soup with a plop of sliced beef in congealed gravy, I would go to one of stalls in the food court inside the plaza that houses this restaurant.  I can get pretty much anything that is served here at a stall inside the food court at a similar, if not lower price, and of better quality.  I love cheap Western/Chinese food, but this place just doesn't do it for me.

This is located in a plaza with limited surface parking.  There is a free underground parking lot if you can't find parking outside.  Just follow the signs."}
{"text":"This is by far my FAVOURITE Chinese/Western Breakfast place!  You can come here (before 11:30am) to get a delicious breakfast of macaroni in soup, 2 slices of toast, 2 slices of ham and 2 pan fried eggs AND a drink (anything hot: tea, coffee, milk tea, hot lemon/honey water...etc) all for $4.99!

The decor and such aren't fab but for that price! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"It is great that Rural Restaurant finally smarten up and put this big neon OPEN sign at the storefront. 

Numerous time I came here for Breakfast/Lunch/Afternoon Tea, I thought this place was closed down!!  

Yes, Rural Restaurant does look like a sketchy place out front. The windows always has this layer of dirt on them and a sign that is handwritten about a $3.50 specials.... Surprisingly the inside is really clean and \"modern\" with recent renovations?

Rural Restaurant is the only Hong Kong Style Cafe that I know in the area that opens at 7 AM for breakfast. Nothing beat having a cheap/light/decent breakfast with milk tea first thing in the monring!

Afternoon Tea set has over 25 different choices. My favourite is their Special Big Bowl Noodle Soup ($4.99) that comes with a choice of drink. The toppings always plentiful and the beef tendon always tender...... 

Staffs are all super friendly...and they all seems to enjoy working here!!

Cash Only!"}
