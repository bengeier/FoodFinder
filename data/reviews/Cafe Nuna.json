{"text":"Love their rose latte! A good variety of beverages and baked goodies.
Cool ambience and friendly staff- will be back!"}
{"text":"We got the eggs benedict and the clubhouse sandwich and they were both quite mediocre. The hollandaise sauce was like a thin mayo that tasted nothing like hollandaise. Also the prices fall more into $$."}
{"text":"Have to give this place 4.5 stars because there's always room for a little improvement. I use to go here when it was called Niche Cafe. 
The new name peaked my interest because núna is now in Icelandic and My husband is imported from Iceland. 
The owners knew the word was Icelandic but that's about the only reference to Iceland besides maybe the skýr with granola, fruit and honey. (See photo)

I ordered the greens sandwich (vegan grilled vegetables)
and It was really good. What I loved most was how hot it was. Too often vegetable sandwiches are either undercooked, cooked but luke warm or the bun is cold. This sandwich was delicious and hot. 

My husband and mother-in-law both had omelettes and they were quite satisfied. They really liked the herbs on the potatoes. 

Our son had the skýr with granola and I asked if they would make a smaller bowl for him (he's 2.5 yo) which they happily obliged. My only critique was way too much honey. But that could probably be adjusted if you know to ask ahead. Which I definitely will next time. 

Lovely owners, kind and attentive young lady behind the counter. I look forward to trying it a few more times to see if the food and service stay consistent."}
{"text":"Great vibe - exactly what you'd expect from a hip coffee shop on Queen West. Quality coffee and baked goods."}
{"text":"A gem tucked in the not so chic Queen Street West neighbourhood! Nice quiet cafe with some creative dessert gig going! You are really in for a surprise when you order the \"Nuna Surprise\"!  I ended up getting a matcha ice cream shake with tons of marshmallow goodies that came with it! Definitely will recommend if you are looking for a quiet corner with light music and a great place for dessert! Surprise me again Cafe Nuna!!!"}
{"text":"Had their latte (meh) and their frenchie waffle (French toast meets waffle) which is yummyyyyyyy!! Would return and when I do I think I'll ask for double shot for the latte. It is quite milky for my liking (maybe they just did one shot of espresso and overloaded it with milk)."}
{"text":"Ordered a drip coffee with almond milk. Good quality coffee, cozy environment, recommend!"}
{"text":"Very cute cafe ge5s 4 stars for being open super early!

The good
- Very kind staff, seated us right away and checked on us multiple times.
- Food was delicious and fresh and played beautifully. Also came very quickly!
- The coffee selection is awesome! My sister had the rose latte.
- Very quaint little space I like the modern feel.
- Overall ambience was awesome.
- they offer ritual pick up if that's your jam.

The bad
- Bathrooms were not the nicest, painted black for some reason and slight stench of urine everywhere. 
- Pricing is a bit on the higher end.
- seating is a bit cramped but hey we aren't in Markham anymore and real estate is prime.

I'd definitely be back if I'm in the area..i hope this place does very well!"}
{"text":"Contrary to other reviews, this is NOT a hipster coffee shop, and thank god for that--Queen West has more than enough of those. This is an unpretentious, pleasant, family run cafe, offering all you could need or want: well-made espresso drinks, plain but satisfying sandwiches, salads and egg/brunch dishes at good prices, pleasant, unassuming decor (lots of wood), a nice bright aspect looking out onto Queen West (especially pleasant in summer with the floor length windows opened; great people watching!), super friendly and dedicated service, and $4 tall cans of SideLaunch beer. In other words pretty much everything I want out of my neighbourhood local. I'm sold."}
