{"text":"Pretty slow service even though the restaurant was pretty much empty with us being the only customers. 
The food was mediocre, and for the price of the all you can eat, we aren't going back! There are much better AYCE sushi in Montreal than here."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy good food, great services, reasonable prices, also there are lots of food choices here. My friend and I could find what we interested most food in this sushi restaurant. Most importantly, free parking here after 5pm!!! Anyway, I will go back there with my friends for trying more delicious food!"}
{"text":"Sushis plutôt moyen: beaucoup de riz, peu de poisson et de garniture et pas particulièrement gouteux. Par contre, les autres plats sont très bons, gouteux. J'ai beaucoup aimé la soupe miso, les brochettes, les crevettes a l'ail et le chow mein. Bref, si j'y retourne, ce sera plutôt avec l'idée de manger des entres et des plats fusion a volonté."}
{"text":"I came in expecting sushi. What I got...well, nothing worth the $20.

You know a restaurant has made a mistake when (a) you have to fill out your order and (b) need to have the mechanics explained to you. You know they have made another mistake when you visibly cannot identify the food based on your order. (Actually, even after eating a roll I couldn't determine what it was.) And finally, when you have to flag down staff twice for the bill...well, it's best to leave it at that.

The food was certainly edible (and arrived quickly!), but the rice varied greatly in consistency, the spicy tuna rolls were neither spicy nor resembling tuna, and the scallops were literally just pre-breaded freezer brand as opposed to actual grilled ones. Sushi varied in size between comically big (their idea of a \"California roll\") and unusually tiny (nigiri).

There is room to improve. Switch to by-the-plate pricing. Drop the chinese dishes and improve the sushi. Provide the kind of sushi commonly seen in Vancouver or Asia. But as it is it's just a very expensive buffet."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend on a Friday night. The restaurant is very cute, and not crowed at all. We were given a seat immediately and attended to by very polite and efficient waitresses. We ordered from the all you can eat menu: it is pretty standard: you choose what you want from each category. 

The fish was super fresh and tasty, and the rice well seasoned. Overall, I think these might be the best sushis I have ever had in Montreal. Great variety from classics to new trends, they probably have it all. 

Included in the all you can eat is ice-cream (green tea, red beans, mango and vanilla) and cakes you can chose from.

The only thing is that as the sushis are made on order, you will wait a bit between each serving. However, this will give you time to digest and eat even more! 

I really enjoyed eating here and I will definitively come back. I think this place would be great for groups! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Long review but worth the read!!! I literally just had dinner here and even rushed back to my hotel to write this review while it's fresh in my mind.. First off, to all Odaki lovers .. i'm sorry but if you think this place is great and has the best sushi in town then you haven't really had REAL sushi/sashimi/authentic Japanese food!!! 

I'm from Chicago and in the food business. Please take my word when I say this place is not worth trying! Before trying Odaki, I  did read the reviews and most were good (I should've listened to that small percentage of bad reviews). While the place looked nice and upscale, not as authentic, here is the list of things that went wrong:

1.) Received our sashimi (pretty small pieces compared to what I am use to) however the waiter did NOT give us the wasabi, ginger and most importantly the soy sauce. Typically most places have the soy sauce on the table but we had to ask for it. 
2.) Ordered the \"Spicy Tuna Maki\" which you'd think would be spicy but it had no hint of spice, it was mainly filled with rice and you could barely even taste any tuna. 
3.) Ordered the \"Spider Roll (soft-shell crab) \" which typically comes with 8 pieces (includes the crab legs as the end parts of the roll but we received 6 pieces. 
4.) Ordered the Baked Mussels w/spicy sauce - big mistake, only got 2 pieces, spicy sauce tasted like oyster sauce. Not to mention they charge $8.50 BUT the menu online states its only $5.50.
http://www.odakisushi.ca/odaki-menu.html
5.)  Getting water refilled was impossible. we asked one waiter, he said OK and never came back. we saw he was in the back helping other tables. So had to ask another waiter which took atleast 10-15 min to get his attention. 
AND I saved the best for last ...
6.) Got our check and we decided to partially pay in cash and the remainder on a credit card. Because of the service and unappetizing food, I did not want to leave a tip but i did anyway. The waiter must not know Math all too well because he asked to add a tip!! 

Very disappointed. Still hungry."}
{"text":"Odaki est un restaurant japonais, reconnu pour sa grande variété de sushi de qualité supérieure, fichtrement bien apprêtés. L'ambiance, quoique très chique et tendance, n'a rien de particulière; une chose est certaine, l'on vient définitivement ici pour se repaître goulûment. Ce qui est intéressant avec le buffet à volonté, c'est qu'on est pas obligé de se gaver d'entrées qui servent normalement à limiter les dépenses. Oui, c'est un buffet à volonté, mais faites gaffe, n'ayez surtout pas la faim plus grande que la panse, car vous serez contraints (oui! oui!), contraints de payer ce que vous laissez dans votre assiette, surtout s'il en reste beaucoup... C'est pas parce que c'est un buffet qu'on a le droit de gaspiller impunément de la nourriture aussi fraîche!... Pour les incertains, il y a toujours le menu à la carte. Car que vous ayez choisi le menu à la carte ou le buffet (que vous commandez, en réalité), des serveurs vous apportent vos assiettes.

Il est à noter qu'il n'est pas nécessaires d'aimer les fruits de mer (quoiqu'en abondance... caviar, goberges, pétoncles, crevettes, etc.), car vous pourrez aisément vous servir une gigantesque assiette de viandes, nouilles et légumes parfumés. Buf teriyaki, légumes sautés, filets de porcs, brochettes de poulets, etc.

{"text":"We've been to Odaki over a dozen times for lunch. While the sushi isn't exceptional (go to Sakura for that), it is consistently good at the price. Lunch is supposed to be till 3pm, but we've often seen people being turned away as early as 1:45pm by the waiter, especially when the owners aren't around. We've also been to the Odaki on St.Catherine, and it was horrible compared to the one on St.Laurent."}
{"text":"Advertised prices are not the same as the options you have + sushi quality was not even good  

No complains about the services."}
{"text":"I rarely give one star reviews but my visit to Odaki prompted me to rate this terrible establishment. 

If you bought a groupon, RETURN IT ASAP!!!! They discriminate against groupon holders. I went one day and the restaurant was half empty but some people with the groupoon were denied entry because they \"did not make a reservation.\"

If you did not buy a groupoon: DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!! Why avoid? Bad service and terrible food. 

Concerning service: extremely slow! To get seated, it took a very long time even though we had reservations.  They did not give us any water until we asked, and it took us  three times to ask (I'm not kidding, I asked three times for water at five minutes interval). Service was so bad. We had to ask for everything: ex. Ask for the menu, ask for more water, ask for another order sheet (3 times until we got it), etc. If we didn't ask, we would be sitting at our table like idiots waiting for nothing.... SERVICE WAS NON EXISTENT OR EXTREMELY SLOW.  

Now the food: SO BAD! At first, we ordered some nigiri sushi and sashimi. The presentation was horrible. The pieces were inconsistent, some big some small, and really ugly. They put way too much rice and very little fish. For example, the tuna sushi we ordered: 95% rice and 5% fish (a VERY THIN LAYER OF SLICED TUNA ON TOP OF A LOT OF RICE... Like a thin veneer of tuna). Are you kidding me? Now I know all you can eat places tend to put more rice but ODAKI really takes it to another level. I've been to other sushi places like Kanda, sushi tokyo, sushi crescent, sushi tokyo, sushi 999 etc, but Odaki really is the skimpiest and provides meagre amount of fish. I mean it's 29$ a person, more expensive than other places, and they give you less fish. Not acceptable!!! They take us for fools if they think we don't notice the poor quality of the food. The maki sushi were ok but not great. A lot of stuff we ordered did not even come. For example, we ordered beef sashimi and baby octopus sashimi. It did not come at all without notice or explanation. So maybe they forgot? We order these two items again at the second round. It still doesn't come ! And so we ordered a third time as a last ditch effort. Nope, didn't come. Did they forget? We ordered the same thing three times so I doubt it.... Is it unavailable ??? At least tell me!!! This is just an example as there were other items that were not served as we ordered. I think we got about 70% of everything we ordered in total. What happened to the rest of the 30% that we ordered??? They just cancel without telling us.. 

So in conclusion: avoid this restaurant like the plague. I've been to this restaurant a few years ago and it was nothing like this. The service and food have taken a nose dive and perhaps because of new management?? I can tell you that we were not the only unhappy patrons at the restaurant. The other clients, it seemed to me, were equally frustrated with the service. 

I did not use a groupon for my visit, as they kept asking (over the phone, at the restaurant when we arrived, when they give us the menu, when I went to pay). It almost feels that if I had a groupoon, I would be treated differently. Although I don't know how worse as my experience was already extremely bad!!

So DO NOT GO TO ODAKI!!! And RETURN YOUR GROUPONS WHILE YOU STILL CAN, usually you have 14 days I think??

It's not a coincidence this restaurant has such poor reviews. Just google!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best all you can eat in montreal! Service is awesome and their sake is delicious (but a bit expensive). They have this menu card where you can check what you want and it comes to your table few minutes later. Pretty hard to find a parking though."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that anyone would pay money for their deemed attempt at \"Sushi\" or lackluster/overbearing chicken dishes. To start off, our group had made reservations and were shown a cute/quaint room, very cozy, very authentic...if only we knew of how long we would actually be spending in that room, our initial thoughts would beg to differ. The menu, though seemingly easy to comprehend, took the staff an eternity to order and/or put through. As the dishes slowly, I MEAN SLOWLY, exited the kitchen, we were stunned at the small portions and overall unattractiveness of the food. Nothing looked fresh, and the salad appeared as though it had been rotting from the inside out. The soup had a pungent stench to it, creating the fist bout of uneasiness in my stomach. As the night progressively got worse, the food service became slower and slower, grinding to a halt if you will. We got food we didn't order and had to fill out yet ANOTHER menu to place our order because apparently, nothing was going our way. A secondary server, who was neither fluent in French or English, made us aware that they would be closing soon and to pay at the counter. Following his satire and eye rolls, we refused, politely. To our dismay, we barely ate and refused to leave until we had done so.When and \"IF\" the food came it was repulsive beyond belief, I would barely classify it as 'food' and neither feed this to my dog or my worst enemy. 
I, along with my group members, became terribly ill the next day, therefore, this ghastly excuse for a restaurant deserves almost no stars in my opinion. I would rather pay with rocks than pay with money, for that is what the food and service is worth. Please avoid this restaurant, there are a zillion better all you can eat sushi restaurants out there."}
{"text":"We had a group of 4 and did the all you can eat for 20$each.  First walking in the establishment didn't look very welcoming but our waitress was.  We made our choice on the buffet for a diverse sushi selection amongst beef and chicken teriyaki. First off I'm not a huge sushi eater, actually I narrow my sushi likings just to California roll and that's pretty much it. We received our trays of food and the California rolls were pretty tasty but definitely not fresh, the beef was very undercooked and the chicken teriyaki was decent. Everything else seemed fine but for the price I can name you better places for better quality food.   Although overall my friends did enjoy their meals I say it was simple and plain OK experience."}

{"text":"Overall, a confusing and over-priced experience.

Craving some sushi on a Saturday evening so decided to try this place with a friend of mine.
Despite an empty dining room with big chairs that took two hands to maneuver getting into and out of - we were seated next to a six-top of American girls. I've got nothing against American girls but when they are all singing along to Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' that's playing over the restaurant's sound system...

It took four trips from our server to figure out how to order. Buffet? Kitchen menu? Buffet Kitchen menu? I've done the whole thing where you mark your sushi choices on a menu sheet with a pencil but this was more complicated by '2 pieces allowed here, 3 pieces allowed here, you want another sheet for two buffets?'. Wha?
So finally I said to her quietly, 'We want to order some sushi and sashimi, can we just do that? Would that be ok?'. She brought back another menu.

Do I need to go into how the food was or have you already moved on to another idea for where to go for sushi?
Oh ok. 
The food - meh. Yep, that's white tuna sashimi and that's a kamikaze roll and those are scallops on skewers with sauce and sesame seeds. 
 $90 for the two of us to eat just enough + small bottle unfiltered cold sake.

Our server with the Mickey Mouse necklace was really patient thus I give her two stars. Thanks friendly lady."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi for $26.99 when you're famished and options that aren't crowded in the area are limited - Sold!  Not the best sushi I have ever had, but not the worst either, kinda middle of the road. Never heard of sushi pizza - 
thought it was original and pretty tasty.  Chicken dumplings were light/non greasy and deserve a mention as well.  Good food for a reasonable price and decent customer service. :-)."}
{"text":"I'll break this review into 3 parts

Micro review : The worst sushi of my life.

Short review:

The rice had too much vinegar and the sushi was not fresh.
The place was empty, with one waiter and one cook and it was still painfully slow to get anything. The (evening) selection is severely lacking, and the web menu showed things that we could not get on the paper menu. Free parking in the back 

Long review:

You have to keep in mind that I rarely give one star reviews, I know how hard it is to run a restaurant, but if you don't know what you are doing, you deserve to fail.

It was freezing and my friend was in town to visit, we did not want to deal with parking downtown,so our choices were limited to Nami, Sushi Plus and Odaki, since they all offer free parking.

Once here, we saw that the place was empty, fine, could be the weather, but the place itself was freezing, no heat turned on and waiter wants to sit us in the breezy middle.

We see the menu, and so far so good, the selection is not the biggest since some sushi staples seem to be missing compared to their photo menu I saw before going 
http://www.odakisushi.ca/odaki-buffet.html

Their numbered menu skipped over so many numbers, it was clear their menu was sliced in half. No Sushi Pizza, 4-5 Sashimi, 7-8 Nigiri, and half the Maki rolls were not on our menu. 

We started off with some salmon sushi, and from the first bite, the vinegar in the rice hit us. Terrible, terrible failure and an embarrassment.

The selection of rolls is really tiny and just as un-fresh as the sushi. 
After the first plates were cleared, we decided to steer clear of anything with rice, 
The only thing that was tolerable was the sashimi, not the best, but it didn't have rice. 

We now concentrated on stir-fry and skewers, whoa boy. 
The first were OK,with nice noodles and veggies, but the beef skewers were just mystery meat, not looking anything like teriyaki, the chicken was a bit better.

The shrimp tempura looked fake since all the pieces were the exact shape and size and the tail seemed to be missing. The veggie tempura was not much better since it was fried in ancient oil and it's all we can taste. Their menu online lists 35 Appetizers and Hot Meals, but in reality is closer to 15-20 ( No shrimp with  garlic butter, no scallop yakitori, soft shell crab or mussels and many others.

The whole time we were there, maybe 3-4 tables came and went in under an hour, we wanted to get our money's worth so we stayed. The service was slow with only one chef and one waiter who was just walking nervously and fidgeting all over the place from a lack of clients (Might I suggest trying your food to see the problem)

If I was rich, I would have left after a the first bite and gone to Sushi Plus.

The funniest part is at the end, we asked for dessert, and we were told we had to get it ourselves, the ice cream is self serve, which we found hilarious and a nice coup-de-grace to the worst sushi I've had in my life. I felt so bad for choosing this place I paid for my friend, he rarely eats out because he's in the army and it was his first sushi in 2 years."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of purchasing a groupon for this place. I've tried dozens of sushi restaurants in Montreal over the years and while one learns not to expect too much from \"all you can eat\" this place really takes the ticket for most disappointing. Immediately after walking in you can tell the restaurant has let itself go in every way- ambience, service, organization etc. They should know better than to serve the sushi they do but i suspect most people who go there are first and last timers- tourists, Groupon users etc. Save your time and money- there are mush better all you can eats in town. Shocked that it is still open. When you run a place with such little pride perhaps its time to close shop and try something else."}
{"text":"From start to finish, the experience at Odaki was pretty awful. We were (eventually) seated at a table in the near-empty restaurant where there were freshly made soy sauce stains and the chopsticks looked as though they'd been used and placed back in the pouch thing. Now, I live in Vancouver so my standards for sushi are naturally quite high. I also failed to mention that I'm not necessarily the most seasoned of sushi-lovers yet and I generally stick to more vegetarian choices. 

Though I can be adventurous with my food, I consider myself still relatively new to the whole sushi scene. When my spicy veggie roll arrived, it was covered in fish eggs. I was not down with that, and as a result immediately asked if it were possible to have the sushi remade without any of the fish eggs. That was nice, however the ingredients were not fresh and the prices were such a rip off. Luckily they didn't charge me for the extra one. However, the veggie tempura came to almost 9$ for maybe 5 pcs, which was astonishingly high-priced and low quality considering what I've tried in the past. My sister ordered pork dumplings which were served in a big puddle of not so tasty peanut sauce and they tasted strange and watery. Even my sister who is more experienced in sushi and Japanese food than I felt this place to have ripped us off tremendously. We were shocked that our bill came to almost 50$ all together and we had not ordered that much food. The miso soup was the last thing to arrive...very strange.

They were still playing Christmas music even though our visit was during the second week of January. Another big no-no. 

Anyways, all-in-all, I would never return. In fact I advise anyone wandering this part of town on an empty stomach with a jonesing for some sushi to avoid Odaki at all cost. If you decide to eat here, you will leave disappointed, feeling ill in your stomach from the not-so-fresh ingredients, and several (wasted) dollars poorer."}
{"text":"The Japanese Student Association at my uni organized a sushi outing that my friends and I thought were a steal. 20$/each for AYCE sushi dinner. What prompted me to write this review is the fact that they are on groupon and I just want to warn everyone that eating at this sushi restaurant is simply not worth it.

Odaki St Laurent was my worst AYCE experience ever. The event was SOLD OUT. Even knowing that there would be a full house, the manager only got 2 sushi chefs working the entire night. We got there at 7:30pm until 9:45pm, we only got 1 plate of sushis (20 pieces) amongst four people. We ordered 20 pieces of sashimi and received 0. After that, we were only given the small dishes (seaweed salad, self-served ice cream ps: the matcha ice cream doesn't even taste like matcha?!, takoyaki)

Myself and another friend were able to stay later until 11:30. Only after most people had left, were we slowly receiving our sushis. At this point, it was midnight and we had already filled ourselves with the self-serve ice cream since we were so hungry and desperate while waiting for the sushi. The sushi itself was decent. Too bad it took them 3 hours to get some to us. 

Now, we weren't the only table complaining. If you looked around us, basically no one had any food at all. We were all starving and the 2 chefs + waiters/waitresses were disorganized and frantic since they had to serve ~70 hungry people. Since we had paid in advance for our tickets, it wasn't like we could be refunded. We asked to speak with the manager, and the waiter gave a petty excuse saying the manager couldn't speak English. No problem, we had someone who would speak English, French, Cantonese, Mandarin and Vietnamese in our group. However, he never showed up once.

We probably would've been better off (and full on sushi) if we had just contributed $20 each and bought a sushi platter. We would've gotten more sushi that way."}
{"text":"Too lazy to cook or walk very far, I went to the closest restaurant to my place. I thought that since it was on St-Laurent it was either going to be overpriced or disgusting. I'm happy to say I was wrong. 

They have a list of combo specials which were quite generous. I ordered combo A for take-out. 15 pieces total; including 2 large tempura shrimps. $10.   

On the menu itself, they sell some unusual sushi. However, the waitress couldn't even explain what they were. 

I asked for an extra of spicy mayonnaise and they didn't charge me. That was surprising, considering so many restaurants charge for it. 

I will definitely go back. The price was good and the quality was acceptable."}
{"text":"I don't even know how to begin describing how awful the service was. You guys should know that I love to eat anything and everything, have a pretty good insight about the difference between good and bad sushi, and will forgive poor service if the food is good, and if there is at least and attempt at providing good service. Odaki does neither.

We were a party of 9 with reservations on a recent Sunday night. My boyfriend and I were the first ones to arrive (early). It took a few minutes to get someone's attention, and when I did, he seemed confused about the reservation. He eventually pointed at a booth in the corner by the window, and we were left to go over there by ourselves. The waiter did not come by and we sat there for 10 minute without menus or water, until the rest of my family arrived. Only then did the waiter come by, and only because my dad waved him over. When we asked to get the all-you-can-eat menu, the waiter seemed confused, as we were still waiting for 2 people (who were just parking their car), but is it so strange of a request to get a menu so that we can get a head start on ordering? 

Our miso soups arrived about 10 minutes later and we ordered another sheet of food. However, the next bit of food, which turned out to be maki, did not arrive for 40 minutes later! The restaurant was on the busy side with only two waiters, but we ordered a variety of things and  there would definitely have been something that could have been served faster than that. And we had to ask for the wasabi/pickled ginger. Not long after that our waiter (who seemed to understand what we asked in slow-motion, and had zero personality whatsoever) came back to tell us that the kitchen had lost our second order. So we had to order again.

The whole night just went on like that. We would try and get ahead by submitting orders whenever food arrived, but the food that did end up coming to our table was sporatic and not necessarily what we had ordered. We would take into account how many pieces of maki or sashimi were supposed to be in each serving, and order accordingly, and they would always give us a strange amount. The waiter/kitchen kept forgetting orders and it would only be brought out when we enquired about it. Some things straight out did not arrive. If the kitchen is out of a specific dish, it would be really nice if they told us about it! 

Because the food sometimes arrived and sometimes didn't, and because it came out in such a staggered way, it came to a point where we really didn't know if the previous order was going to be completed, or if the kitchen was going to forget about it again. It was as if every time we submitted a new order, they just threw away our old order and started over again. And contrary to other reviewers, they did not refill our water often at all! I would say maybe 5 times over the course of the 3 hours.

The food itself was ok. Not great by any means but not horrible and no one got food poisoning. The sashimi came in tiny little 1-inch cubes. The only thing thing that stood out was the grilled salmon head. But I don't think I could tell you objectively if anything else was actually good because the whole meal ended up taking 3 hours, and by that time we were all so hungry that we were just scarfing down whatever was brought to us. The other Odaki on St-Catherine St is much better (the two have the same name but are not related at all), food-wise and most definitely service-wise. This Odaki is just a mess. Partway through dinner, my dad went to speak with the manager to complain about the horrible service, and he had no reaction. No apology, and not even an excuse. And the tip was automatically added to our bill because we were a large group, but the restaurant did nothing to deserve this tip. This place does not deserve anyone's money!"}
{"text":"Their udon is stir-fried not souped. Skewers are horrible. Beef are not well done."}
{"text":"Shitty fking delivery, the portion is shitty small, and when we call to complain they said they will talk to their boss and call as back soon, but when we call 15 min later they told us thy haven't talk to their boss yet and told us to wait for another 5, but we still have to call back in 10 min without a good way to solve the problem"}
{"text":"Guys, it's not rocket science.  This is the first time my wife and I have been to a sushi buffet where it's a made-to-order type of buffet.  Of course we had some initial questions but the waiter only explained it once and it was quite simple from that point on.  Part of two?  That means your table can order 6 pieces of this 4 pieces of that (i.e. 3 pieces or 2 pieces per person, respectively).  When and only when you're done with your first ordering, you get another copy of the menu to order more.  SIMPLE

We ordered the basics, nigiri and sashimi (salmon, tuna, mackerel, white tuna), and some maki (can't remember the names but they sounded like specialty rolls - one was called Odaki).  The food was nothing real special except for one roll, the Dragon Eye roll.  I have a taste for fried foods so I am probably being biased here but that roll was what made it worth going there.  The roll wasn't exactly deep fried.  It was only lightly fried and was VERY yummy!  I remember it having fish eggs in it (flying fish roe?), a bit of spicy mayo, some salmon and other bits.  All I remember is, I was getting to the point where I couldn't eat one more bite until I looked at the menu one last time, and decided to try the Dragon Eye roll.  I ended up eating the entire thing and it was worth every second!

So I've read (from other places too) that the service here isn't great.  I'd have to agree.  We spent well over an hour in there, maybe close to 2 and some of it was because we spent a lot of time deciding what to get, but other times, the waiter and waitress were nowhere to be found.  They didn't appear to be looking out for us.  We really had to flag them down if we wanted something.  I guess they did fill our water often?  Oh well.  I still give them four stars and the Dragon Eye roll alone gets its own star :-)"}
{"text":"My unagi was good, but that is as positive as I can get for my review. Our server was extremely rude, didn't even bother bringing us the entire menu, took forever to come back to our table for our order. The all you can eat hot foods were still cold, so they nuked it in the microwave.. how nice. EEK, Me thinks not indeed."}
{"text":"Best Sushi bar in town! The food is yummy and comes fast. This restarant really has a reasonable price! The tea cup is so cute. it has a cute three dimentional golden fish sculpture at the bottom. The tea tastes so authentic. definitely recommend the tea!"}
{"text":"I went once for all-you-can-eat and once for a-la-carte. While options in the a-la-carte are better, the price is too much. We ate worth nearly $90 ($30 initially on $60-worth groupon for 2 people + $30 including tax and tips) of okay quality food.. All-you-can-eat is not bad but there's nothing special about this place that would make me want to come back. Sushi isn't special/fresh enough, Ambiance is a bit dingy, drinks are too expensive. The only thing that could give this place any business is the location.. Even being in the heart of st laurent blvd, this place fails to attract customers.. It is sad since with little effort, this place could rock! It has the location, cuisine and menu, space! All it needs is hard work!!"}
{"text":"I had a coupon in the mail from this place for the dinner buffet where we get 20 percent off the price. I had ordered takeout from them before and figured I'd actually go there for dinner tonight since the coupon was due to expire in 2 days. So first of all, the address of this restaurant is supposed to be 3977 Saint-Laurent. I had to ask someone where this place was because it was not located anywhere near 3976 as it would logically be. Anyways, so I finally found it and it turns out that the buffet is not a buffet that we normally think of where you get up and get your own food. I felt a little dumb asking the waitstaff \"so where's the buffet?\" So what you do is write in the amounts of food you would like- 3 selections per order per person. Yes, they give you a pencil and you write on the menu yourself. 

So I ordered salmon teriyaki, miso soup, california rolls, and rice separetely (very surprised that the soup and rice were not included in the entree as most Japanese places offer). For $22.95, it is all you can eat and you order as much as you want so it is a decent deal considering how expensive Japanese food can be. So everything comes as it should (service is a little slow in the beginning) and then the waitress brings over a single piece of salmon for me. All I could say was -----_______------
So obviously, I pulled her aside and asked her where the rest of my entree was. Politely, she explained to me that because it is a buffet, you can keep ordering more and more. But still..one piece? And folks, I'm talking small. Just a small cut off the fish. Anyways, so I ate it in one gulp pretty much and when I ordered more, I guess she asked the kitchen to give me a little more than a mouse's portion because she brought out a good-sized appetizer portion which was satisfactory because I was filling up on sushi by then. Ice cream is included in the price, but Ha! NOW you get to get up and do something buffet-like..it is self-serve. You grab the spoon and reach down into the big ol' tub of ice cream and dish yourself out some frozen creamy goodness. 

So, in conclusion, it's a nice place interior-wise; nice ambiance and atmosphere.  Chances are I'll come back since the dinner buffet is not a bad bargain at all."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend on a Friday night. The restaurant is very cute, and not crowed at all. We were given a seat immediately and attended to by very polite and efficient waitresses. We ordered from the all you can eat menu: it is pretty standard: you choose what you want from each category. 

The fish was super fresh and tasty, and the rice well seasoned. Overall, I think these might be the best sushis I have ever had in Montreal. Great variety from classics to new trends, they probably have it all. 

Included in the all you can eat is ice-cream (green tea, red beans, mango and vanilla) and cakes you can chose from.

The only thing is that as the sushis are made on order, you will wait a bit between each serving. However, this will give you time to digest and eat even more! 

I really enjoyed eating here and I will definitively come back. I think this place would be great for groups! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I had an all-around nightmare experience at this place. When I walked through the door and looked at a menu, it was clear that this was not going to be high-quality sushi, but I was hungry, so I stayed. Little did I know I'd be sick for the next 36 hours afterward. 

First I ordered the house sake, served hot, and watched the waiter pour a carafe and then heard the beeping and humming of a microwave. I was less than pleased, but let him serve me the sake and did not touch it. 

Soon I noticed a lot of small flies (like fruit flies) buzzing around the sake. I called over the waiter and asked him if this was a problem at the restaurant, and if they kept their fish refrigerated and fresh, and he assured me they did and that it was the first time he'd noticed flies. 

The quality of the sushi was abysmal - the rice was crunchy and drenched in vinegar, and the fish was clearly not good quality. After I'd eaten half of my salmon and avocado roll, I picked a piece apart to look at the fish and it was gray around the edges. Disgusted, I asked the waiter to take it away, after which he ushered me to the counter to pay full price for my meal. 

The next morning, I woke up feeling a little off, and didn't eat breakfast. I ate a light lunch at home, and then became properly sick - upset stomach and high fever. I waited it out and two days later I'm feeling better, but was sick for a good 36 hours."}
{"text":"I have been eating at that place for at least 4 years and it used to be good and started to go worse and worse till last week. I have eaten at that place minimum 20 times, but last week it was so bad that I decided not to go anymore if they won't change. 
The food was very bad, presentation and taste.whatever you eat it tastes old. The maki were so hot and they tasted the same. The service was soo slow and they barely talk or smile. 
Last time am going there"}
{"text":"Les sushis sont délicieux, la présentation est belle aussi. Je ne suis pas déçu. Par contre, je trouve qu'il manque de choix de variété dans les sushis à volonté."}
{"text":"Slow. I walked in thinking about ayce, but I noticed there were two parties without food with only one sushi chef. So I thought better and just ordered teriyaki -- as I type this, it's been about 15 minutes and my food hasn't come yet. The other table *finally* got their food and they look very irritated. 

There's only one waiter. I very much regret my decision. In all honestly, unless the food is as good as a hug from Jesus Christ, nothing would make me wait that long for freaking teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"I'm glad I had not seen the other reviews before venturing into this place.
We had originally planned to go to Kazu (based on reviews) but on arriving there and seeing, not so much the lengthy wait but, the crowds of people sitting in a very confined space, pretty much on top of each other, I decided I could not eat there.
Odaki was convenient.
The place is well lit, looks and smells clean and it's pleasantly decorated.
We were offered all you can eat or the regular menu.  I had an experience with all you can eat sushi before so we turned that down.
The waitress was very adept at getting us liquored up and we were willing subjects.  Had a large bottle of Kirin and two types of cold Sake: an unfiltered one I've enjoyed before and another one that was new to us and quite good.  We both ordered seaweed salad which was average.  I had an avocado hand roll and two different vegetarian rolls one which had some spicy sauce.  They were both really good and very feeling.  My husband had some tuna sashimi and a dragon eye roll and both were also enjoyed.
They had a good steady crowd but it was not loud or annoying and the tables were comfortably set.
Not the best sushi I've had but very good.
I would call Odaki a keeper."}
