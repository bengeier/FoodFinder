{"text":"This is my favorite casual dining place by far. We used to go down to hopdoddy when we wanted a good burger and fries but am so excited PNPK opened and is so much closer and convenient (plus you have the great outdoor seating which is awesome for kids). Selection is awesome. We loved all the sliders that had bacon or jam (how can you go wrong with that)? But also you shouldn't pass up the fried chicken one or the queso one with green chilies (my hubby is from New Mexico and those green chilies are legit). Dessert was amazing as well. Have been back several times since the opening. Definitely recommend for casual dining with the fam or date night (we have done both)!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of snacks! The deviled eggs are delicious. The review is for the service. We went for happy hour a couple weekends ago and the server told and brought us the menu. When we got the bill she had charged us full price for everything. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my husband and we really enjoyed everything. The staff was very friendly. We had flights of bruschetta, sliders, deviled eggs, dessert, and of course wine. My husband had a yummy gin drink. Everything was delicious and we will definitely stop back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my husband for happy hour and it was pretty decent. We ordered the fig bruschetta, deviled eggs, candied bacon and Americana sliders. We also ordered flights of wine and got the red blend,  savigion blanc, and the Chardonnay. All were totally tasty and only five bucks! I think we ordered a total of six apps and got two flights each and the bill was 52 bucks. Super reasonable and the food was delicious. I would definitely go back again for happy hour. There is a good crowd as this is north Scottsdale. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened this week so had to go try it.

Innovative menu, tasty sliders, spicy queso, prompt and friendly service, all in a beautiful atmosphere. The patio even has a small fireplace to enjoy on cooler evenings.

The only thing I'd change I would offer is different or more dessert options. 

This is our new, favorite neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"I love this spot! The decor is elegant and modern. The lighting is perfect. The food is great (especially the sweet tots) the beer is cold and the servers are friendly. Also the location is great! Check it out. Fun menu with lots of \"flight\" options. Like American tapas!"}
{"text":"I hate to give 4 stars but my experience was 2 star service with 5 star food. The owner was very nice, they had 2 people not show up the service was slow, they never brought our second round and then charged us for it.  The owner apologized and sent a follow up to the review. Food was great.  So 4 stars.   I will be back and give the service a second chance."}
{"text":"Love this place. When we lived in Seattle, there was a place called Purple Wine Cafe. We have missed it ever since we left. PNPK fills that void. Great happy hour pricing. Amazing food; sliders are unique, mac n cheese is really well done, deviled eggs are awesome but the bruschetta is to die for. Drunken cherry and Brie is out of this world. Wine menu is good but the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here to give it a try was told to wait by the door by a person on the move, we then asked the person behind the bar if we could just sit at the bar. We then waited for service. We got served our beers and then poof gone again. My husband and I were going there to give it a try even after the bad reviews, now we won't be back. Cold and sterile that describes this place."}
{"text":"Drove by this restaurant a few times and was intrigued. After stopping in I'm glad we did. This place is already a new favorite. The menu is elevated comfort food with a great bar and great staff to boot. The music is fantastic and the vibe is great. Food is amazing and the wine list is off the charts. The hesitate to recommend it because this is going to quickly become a local favorite but it's too good to keep to ourselves. If you are looking for great casual food with an upscale menu and a chill vibe then you have found your place. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I tried it for the first time today. Absolutely phenomenal food! I had the meatball and chicken slider with Mac n cheese. I'm sure all their other sliders are equally delicious and I can't wait to try them all! The owner Kelly is so sweet and her husband Rich is just as super. Go and try it. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went and I really loved the blueberry bbq slider and the bruschetta was super good. However, I did not enjoy the deviled eggs as mine were kind of warm but in general great experience. The staff was sweet and friendly and I plan on going back for sure! It also has a comfortable living room type vibe, but no main courses only tapas. So if you're looking for a dinner place I wouldn't recommend it but for happy hour or a quick snack it's great!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place! The server we had was friendly and pretty on top of stuff--the one mistake he made he corrected quickly and apologized, and he made sure to keep up with us when we needed things. The cocktails were decent, too--a little weak, but very pleasantly flavored. Nice and fruity without being overly sweet.

Unfortunately... the food and wait time were not so great. It wasn't crowded, but it took almost 45 minutes for our party to get maybe 12 sliders, and I'm not sure why, because they were tiny. The meat was maybe the diameter of a 50-cent piece, and was maaaybe half the diameter of the bun itself. There was so much aioli that it was dripping off, so between that, the wait for the food itself (I'm guessing the kitchen got backed up?), and the fact that the beef seemed completely unseasoned...

The bacon was stringy, too, and when two of your sliders center on it, it was a bad look. The fries were fine, but pricy for what they were, and the chicken sliders came with coleslaw on the bun, which definitely wasn't listed on the menu. I don't know what the trend is with leaving components off the menu descriptions, but it's not okay. I'm also pretty sure my boyfriend's onion from the onion rings had gone off.

The idea is great. Wine flights and slider flights sounds like a great night to me, but ultimately the food was bland and not described properly. :("}
{"text":"I love this new place!!! The girlz and I went one night, and had so much fun. Love the sliders, they are perfect for a fun happy hour or dinner. Also, their wine selection is perfect. I'm so thankful this place is so close to home. I'll be back soon, and often."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of sliders and bruschetta of the highest quality with a huge variety of different flavors for anyone's palate 
 I was very impressed and great service !!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great wine selections and the atmosphere was awesome.  Really had a great time.   Try the sliders as an appetizer (or meal) they are amazing.  I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a relaxing, fun time."}
{"text":"Met my girlfriend for Happy Hour Friday night 4/6 - We sat on the patio - they have great umbrellas to help with the sun.  There were 3 couples with dogs, all well behaved, and they seemed to all be enjoying themselves and the dog friendly atmosphere.   We ordered one of their signature HH drinks.  It was delicious with fresh strawberries and mulled Mint.  Our food was delicious -  We ordered 3 types of Brochette, all were amazing!!! The bread they use is so delicious and perfect texture.  Then we ordered the deviled eggs.  Yes a couple could have been a bit more seasoned but all in all they were... good Deviled eggs LOL  The slider we ordered was delicious and hardy and the the tater tots where good tater  tots.  I heard the french fries were delicious thou.. Then we each did our own flight of wine on the HH menu.  It was so fun and our waiter definitely knew his wine!!  It was a very busy night --- so happy for PNPK.  So understandably it was a bit of a wait but that is to be expected if you had any vision of how busy the staff was - We were in no rush just relaxed and visited. I think they did an outstanding job keeping super friendly under the pressures !!! Can't wait to go back for another Happy Hour the $$ was amazing for what you got. !!! And also look forward to dining for dinner too!!"}
{"text":"Delicious happy hour! Meatballs, grape salad, fried chicken sliders and deviled eggs all so good! Food came out in a timely manner. Bar staff was great. Too many hostesses and bus boys. Could use more wait staff for Sat night."}
{"text":"We so badly wanted to love this place! But... there's nothing worst then leaving a spot still hungry and feeling like it was a waste of time and money. We walked in and stood there waiting to get seated (even when there were only handful of people in the place) and we waited to meet a our server, then waited even more to place our order. We tried to ignore the annoyance of the waiting game and were hopeful the food would change our judgment... and unfortunately not. The sliders didn't rock my world and at about $5 per slider, I'd rather put that towards a whole burger! The bruschetta listed on the menu sounded very appealing but lacked flavor and was pretty average. The 2 stars go towards the cute decor and pleasant staff but that's all you'll get from this experience."}
{"text":"Upon first seeing the name change of a favorite spot you can't help but be worried. But holy cow was I absolutely BLOWN AWAY by PNPK (formerly Grape Bistro) I went in with a few friends to try it out and couldn't believe what a positive change it was. The already hip interior seems to have been elevated and there wasn't a single item on the menu  that didn't sound good! The happy hour though is by far the best happy hour anywhere in a 10 mile radius. $4 sliders. Get out of town. $5 wine flight!? In Greyhawk!? Am I dreaming? The spicy New Mexico Queso dip was a hit for everyone. My favorite slider was the spicy chicken, and they were much bigger than I expected especially for the price. Others at the table enjoyed the candied bacon slider. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other things they have to offer. So glad to finally have somewhere fun and affordable in the neighborhood with such a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"We finally able to enjoy their Happy Hour and great menu. 
The food was on point. We ordered the sliders, green chili queso dip, deviled eggs flight, bruschetta(s) along with drinks/wine. 
Pretty simple yet delicious. Will need a few more visits to enjoy the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Good menu and atmosphere but worst service I've experienced to the point where we had to walk out. We waited 20 minutes just for someone to acknowledge us then took another 30 minutes to get wine (after complaining to the hostess). Eventually we were there over an hour and the waiter wasn't In sight. I felt bad for him because 1 waiter was in charge of like 12 tables. Had to leave. It's a shame because it has potential."}
{"text":"I just read the most rediculous review...  some peole need to learn to cook at home as they will never be happy.   She complained about not getting free apps when some poor fellow had a heart attack.  I feel bad for Restaurant owners that are subject to such idiotic reviews.  I wish i could review her at her job."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood gem lots of shareables slidera and Bruschetta fabulous wine and beer flights cozy atmosphere and amazing service.  Great date place and perfect place for girls night out"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Great service.  Kid friendly and nice staff.  Neighborhood gem.  Give them lots of visits!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with my first visit.  Sat at the bar and the service was lackluster.  I started with the olive bowl, which came swimming in oil.  Also, the entire bowl was just Kalamata olives.  I would have thought that there would be a variety.  I had been planning on staying for dinner, but decided against it."}
{"text":"I'd like to go straight to the point and say, if you're a group and you're planning to visit the new PNPK... Don't! Now, let me explain. Go, but only if there's one person paying for the entire bill, but avoid if you're seeking for the usual convenience of the split system, because here they won't. What a massive headache and dissapointment it was to get out of this place after 12 of us ate here one Sunday... And the place was not even crowded!! I do not recommended that to absolutely anyone else. I don't recommend the wait for the meal either. One of the members of our party got his soda... No lying.... Nearly one hour later. He re ordered and they forgot again. It was a terrible dissapointment. This place is still very rookie, and it needs a lot of work. The 3 stars are for Krystal. She made up a drink exclusively for me. I didn't know what cocktail to order so, she went to task and brought it home. It was some kind of Mojito, with Strawberries and some kind of liquour. Don't ask me but you can stop by and ask for the Krystal Tea... That's how we named it. Hey, something this good deserved a name. Which by the way the 'Tea' is after my name. Pretty creative, eh? Or should I say, 'Kryst-ative'? Anyway, that's it. Give it a try if you can."}
{"text":"Love this place, only complaint is that they don't decried all eggs or burgers when they deliver to big group - would be helpful."}
{"text":"Outstanding Place. Amazing food with a great happy hour. Best wines in town. Unbelievable sliders and eggs. Everything is made fresh."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful neighborhood restaurant find!
The service staff are so friendly and very accommodating.
We brought our golden retriever and English bulldog to the dog friendly patio and we were in good company with other dog owners and dogs .

The sliders are tasty and on point.  Kudos for their french fries properly cooked and crispy !

I am impressed with their generous happy hour and very reasonable and creative wine , bubble, and beer flights!

I can easily imagine having a work function or personal party at this venue.  

Hip hip hooray for a Cenpho type vibe in northern Scottsdale !"}
{"text":"Came here because it's in my hood and I've been meaning to try it.  Our waiter Mike was great, the food was pretty darn good and the prices and ambiance made it well worth the trip.  I will be back, but first I need to roll out of here after eating this dessert flight."}
{"text":"We so wanted this place to be great and we were not disappointed! The atmosphere and decor are very cool and they have a beautiful patio - perfect for a breezy spring night like tonight. Star number one. Our server, Michael, was chill and nice and always responded with, \"my pleasure!\" That's star number two. Apparently Monday is all day happy hour so the value was great - we had the queso app, 5 sliders, tots, 2 beers, and the dessert flight for $50!  Star number three has been earned. Now for the food...it was really good! I liked the queso dip and thought the roasted hatch chile flavor was delicious. My boyfriend thought the texture was weird but he's weird, so...? Fried chicken slider was awesome. I'm not sharing it next time. Meatball slider was good - needs more sauce. Americana was classic and good (thank you for the pickle). Queso slider I loved, bf thought it was just okay. The falafel slider was the jam! Desserts were pretty good but it was cool they did a flight so we could try them all. Food earned the fourth star. At the end of the night the owner stopped by our table to be sure we were enjoying our evening and we gave her our honest feedback. Nice touch. Fifth star. 

We will be back for sure and hope PNPK sticks around!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite spot! The flights just make the experience so much more fun! We loved the Orange Blossom Beer paired with a falafel slider and deviled eggs. To top it off, the prices match the serving sizes nicely."}
{"text":"PNPK is a Craft Slider, Craft Beer and Wine Restaurant. The menu is mostly different casual American Offerings of Flights of things. It's really different. They offer Flights of Charcuterie, Bruschetta, Devilish Eggs, WINE, Craft Beer, Dessert, the Craft Sliders and more! This restaurant also offers a very comfortable Dog Friendly Patio.

To cut my long story short. I am very found of this UNIQUE casual concept. Ordering a variety of lots of different things is fun and tasty. I did however think some things I tried (other than the sliders) were good but under seasoned and on the bland side. The Craft Sliders on my visit was the Sweet Spot Here. They were fun and interesting enough. Service was very attentive to us and our dogs!

Longer Story-
I came because I heard this restaurant was Dog Friendly and the unique menu sounds fun and interesting. We came and found the Dog Friendly Patio on the side of the restaurant. We were quickly greeted and were offered water right away for us and our dogs. Dogs were then offered biscuits if they were well behaved. 

We started out by sharing a flight of three different Devilish Eggs. They  were all ok but two out of the three were very bland and I'd say under seasoned. The best of the three was the Asian Wasabi. It was very delicate and also on the mild side but did have different flavors going on....

We also shared the Macaroni and Cheese. It was a very nice sized portion and was made with quality noodles that were prepared perfect. I also liked that it wasn't dry like most places serve. It was saucy and cheesy. But this plate also lacked a lot of flavor and could have used a little seasoning. I thought it only needed a little more cheese flavor. Maybe less Swiss cheese and more cheddar.

I tried the Hot Fried Chicken Slider and the Turkey Meatloaf Slider.

The Hot Fried Chicken was delicious and was spicy but not scorching hot like many other places serve it. I like that they actually seasoned the chicken and it wasn't just topped with a sauce for flavor. My slider was topped with slaw that cooled it down, dill pickles and a tasty spicy aioli sauce. This one was very tasty. My husband said it also was very good.

The Turkey Meatloaf Slider has this delicious spicy balsamic on it. It also has mashed potatoes and the meatloaf was very flavorful and delicious.  But.....it would have been perfect if the meatloaf wasn't so mushy.....The flavors were spot on and delicious though. To remedy mushy meatloaf or meatballs you can add some cooked white rice to the recipe and that will bind things up. 

My husband tried three sliders. His favorite of what he tried was the Bangers and Mash. (made with local Schreiner's Sausage) He said the mustard they used on that slider was also extra delicious.

The concept is unique and fun. The craft sliders were fun and interesting...I'll try a different one next time. Service was attentive and the patio was comfortable. 

This is a newly opened restaurant (at this time April 2018) They may still be working things out.

3.5 stars rounded up because they are new and I liked the sliders and service"}
{"text":"We went with another couple last Sat, April 21 to PNPK.   We got there and were told it was a 1 hour wait.  No problem, we had a drink at another location and gave them my phone number.   After 1.5 hours we called and the receptionist said she called but it was the wrong number, when I asked what number she called she told me the correct number...regardless we returned to sit outside.   Problem # 1 we ordered wine and after a long wait we received the wine, but a few minutes later the manager returned and told us that we can't have the wine because it was not put on our bill.  We were confused because we had not ordered yet....she stood there and argued with us that they had closed out our bill and the wine was not included.   We again explained we had not ordered or eaten.  Finally, she stormed off with no apology and our wait person came back to take our order.  We ordered (food was over all way sub par, but that is a different post) My husband order the Mac and Cheese and a slider.   45 minutes later our order came and no Mac and Cheese.  When we summoned the wait person, she said we never ordered Mac and Cheese, the couple that we were with confirmed that it was ordered and she continued to insist that we never ordered. She too stormed off.   The bill came and they had overcharged us for our drinks, plus the Mac and Cheese we never received was on the bill.   While we were contesting the bill, the kitchen staff brought out the Mac and Cheese and we declined it as we were now at the bill page stage.  After several \"discussions\" they corrected the bill and we left....NEVER will we patronize PNPK again.   Bring back GRAPE.   Bad food, BAD service, Poor management and overall bummer of a spot."}
{"text":"Went to PNPK opening weekend and what a disappointment.   I was so hoping this would be our new go to spot.  We were a party of 3 and sat on the patio.   Each of us ordered a flight of sliders.  3 boards arrived and the server had no clue who ordered what and when we tried to tell him he snapped back at us.   He was MIA during the entire dinner service.  The food was mediocre at best and the service was terrible. We wont be going back but if you decide to give this place a whirl then go with the chicken slider."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The wine selection is wonderful and the small plates are delicious. Great happy hour spot. The only negative is that the bar only has one end that would accommodate a group of four people on a corner and there is always a woman sitting there with paperwork. Not sure who she is....maybe a manager? We always do happy hour as a group of four so we are always looking to sit at the corner of a bar where we can face each other and talk.It would be better if she used an office or a table."}
{"text":"We went to PNPK tonight to check out its newest transformation. We found a fun and upbeat vibe, great servers and bartenders, and great food at a great price. We tried a selection of sliders and the Mac & cheese. Each of the sliders was delicious, we did the tuna, hatch chili queso, short rib, and bacon with caramelized onions. The mac & cheese was good, but next time we would do the advanced to give it more flavor.  Our server, Crystal, was delightful!  Our only complaint was the manager. He was rude, telling 10 of us that walked in that we could not have any of their empty tables and that there was a 45 minute wait. Several walked out. Instead, he should have let us know the kitchen was backed up but we could be seated for drinks.  Funny part, within 29 minutes the current round of diners had finished and left and they had a fairly empty restaurant. Definitely recommend this place and recommend replacing the rude and ineffective manager."}
{"text":"So, I'm digging in the new PNPK concept. As opposed to being pigeonholed as just a wine bar, the new direction centers around craft beers, great wine and a plethora of delicious treats for everyone. 

We immersed ourselves into a full flight of all of the Deviled Eggs offered. Yummy may I say! Chef Tony rocks and kicks out great culinary delights.

The burgers are killer and Truffle Fries are amazing. We grabbed up a great bottle of Carne Humana and engrossed in fun conversation and stories.

The patio is large and spacious. It is Pet friendly and can facilitate sizable groups. It is located in a great area across from Sprouts. So, when you finish eating, you can get the shopping done too.

It is on the regular rotation for us! Give them a shot. The decor and bar are beautiful and comfortable. It's a great way to spend an afternoon.

{"text":"Came in on a Friday at around 6:15 and was seated immediately. Waited 20 mins to be acknowledged by the server. Finally came over and apologized because he didn't realize that we were his table. Ordered wine and our entrees when he finally came over. Took another 20 mins to bring a glass of wine to our table. Unknown server brought random order to our table. It wasn't even close to our order. Seems like the staff is struggling with changes made due to the switch from Grape. The food smelled good but not good enough to wait 40 mins just to get a drink. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in just before closing. Barkeep was very friendly. They have a good variety of beers on tap, most notably for me motherroad kolsch and Scottsdale blonde. Menu is unique for the area. Ordered the chicken slider and hatch green chill queso slider. Both very good! Chicken was not greasy at all with light breading. Spoke with Kelly, the owner and she was exceptional! If you are looking for very reasonable and quality food, with great beer and wine section this is your place. We live very close and will definitely be regulars.  Food is exceptional and staff super friendly. Can't beat the prices in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place was..interesting. The hostess did not say \"hello\" to us then we realized there were about 25-45 years older than us. We got drinks but the waitress wouldn't look at us. Like not once. Then it took her about 15 minutes to come back and take our food order. Food was decent. We had two 3 flights of the DevilIsh eggs; which was $6 for 3 half eggs. Overall, it was an awkward experience and I probably wouldn't go back unless they iron out quite a bit of stuff."}
{"text":"Well we thought this was a New restaurant, turns out it is just a reimagined Grape, which closed. We had their sliders, my friend asked for Blu rare, came out medium well, when speaking to waiter and Manager both gave excuse it can't be cooked that rare because it is too small. When I asked if they cooked , manager told me she is Vegen, Really???? Neither cared about our food or if we were satisfied! Owner better tell your cook to follow diners wishes or you will be closing again, meanwhile I wouldn't waste my time or money!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch. Place was 3% full and sliders took an inordinate amount of time to arrive. Patty was severely over cooked. Also had the Hot fried chicken which was neither hot nor cooked properly. It was over fried and dry. Wife had Brie slider that was also severely over cooked and the Ahi slider which she said was good.

We told the server who listened and didn't even offer an apology nor a solution. He took a few dollars off our bill. 

Four sliders and French fries and two aqua pana waters (small) with tip $39.00

We won't return."}
{"text":"Waiter must have been new and didn't write anything down and of course got the order wrong. Portions are super small so eat before you go. Food however was delicious. Deviled eggs are yummy but they use small eggs. Sliders are delicious but about the size of a meatball"}
{"text":"Love, love their new concept!  It's the perfect place for those who enjoy ordering a variety of menu items to share.  I can have a slider (hot fried chicken, bacon jam and French dip are my favs) and split a salad or veggie dish w my husband and his board of sliders and not feel like I overindulged.  Who am I kidding!   I usually wind up eating 2 or 3 sliders!!! Anyway, I love their wine flight menu too and my husband likes their beer selections. Been here 3x and the service has been consistently great.  Oh! and the deviled eggs...lil bites of heaven!  I'm totally craving their smoked salmon w red onion and capers eggs right now!!!

From the mood, to the service, to the food and wine flights, PNPK shines!"}
{"text":"Terrific happy hour and regular menu!!! Kid friendly and wonderful service.  Make this a go to spot for North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"PNPK is in my back yard and the mid-range food options here are mostly just mediocre.  To that end, I really, really want this place to get it right...but it missed as Grape Bistro and is possibly worse as a slider bar.

Since the reconceptualization of the menu from Grape's Tuscan cuisine, it's a bold move to take a sit down-style restaurant/bar, make near zero decor changes (which, btw, was already hip and fun) and then suddenly become a sliders and great wine bar.  I like the idea of abandoning the old menu but the same decor carries the stain of the old underperforming fare.

My wife and I ordered nearly one of each off the menu to sample all the flavors as we regularly will do with a new offering.  I'll focus on the high and lowlights rather than rehashing the entire list.

Deviled eggs are fun and and a perfect medium to show off the kitchen's creativity.  While I find three egg halves at $6 to be pushing the reasonable price limit (it should be double the amount of eggs halves), the Candied Bacon & Jalepeno egg got me excited for more food.  Unfortunately, the Truffle Egg is very heavy handed on the truffle oil and the Bacon Jelly Egg is using a bacon jelly that is best described as \"saccharine.\"

I agree with other reviewers, the sliders are just the right size and appropriately priced.  Unfortunately, the kitchen execution is inconsistent and sporadic.  We ordered a \"Flight of Five\" and every single slider came out at different temperatures.  With the great wine selection, at the very least, I would expect the wait staff to ask you a burger temperature you prefer.  But the service here at PNPK is every bit as cavalier and flippant as it was when it was Grape.  Perhaps that is because they continue to use much of the same mediocre staff.
The first bite was the Santa Fe Slider: great concept...charred to obliterate the potentially good flavor combination of green chilies and cheese.  It's a shame because this slider, if cooked correctly, should be highlight.
Second bite was Bacon Jam Slider recommended by the waitress.  Patty this time was dry and well done but not burnt like the previous one.  To be honest, the bacon jam was too sweet for the deviled egg and it remains too sweet for the slider.
Third was the Brie Slider.  Not enough Brie but the patties are progressively getting toward something that isn't chalky.
Fourth was an utter mess; the Short Rib French Dip Slider.  The concept reads so well but the actual short rib lacks all flavor and the slider bun is backstroking in a jarred horseradish sauce that reminds me of packets of Horsey Sauce I used to get as a kid from Arby's.
Fifth was a hit!!!! The Chicken Slider is the clear winner!!!!!  Our chicken was juicy and the coating has a nice spiced bite that doesn't overwhelm.  We were grateful that this was our last slider bite.

The sides are a list of unremarkable but priced appropriately so no hard feeling here.  I would say that charging for a list of dipping sauces is a poor move.  The dipping sauces don't really pair with any item specifically beyond tater tots.  Let's be honest, if the chef has all these scattered ideas on flavors, perhaps he/she should take the guess work away and just pair them.

On to dessert...which you can skip...
They currently offer one choice of a \"Dessert Flight\" composed of five doughnut holes, a butterscotch pote de creme and two brownies.  The doughnuts came out counter cold and taste like convenience store Doughnettes in the white bag.  The pote de creme had a very odd mealy texture and very little hint of butterscotch.  The brownies were one step below a store bought brownie mix made by a middle school home education class.  Needless to say, we took one bite of each and left the rest on the table.

So with this experience, the waitress was told of the concerns in real time as the items were delivered and sampled.  She overtly couldn't care less and finally with the dessert surrender, she notified a gentleman in a Hawaiian shift, that I presume is the manager.  The dessert was expunged from the bill but the Hawaiian shirt man did not approach the table to explore more.  That was a problem with Grape and it is carrying over.

We got the sense when it was Grape that the leadership/ownership was more interested in the wine than the food.  That sentiment is ongoing in PNPK.

To that end, the wines are great.  Unfortunately, I think this restaurant will become another culinary casualty and be gone inside of a year."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disaster! This is only the second time in my life we have walked out of a restaurant. We have been regular customers of Grape, so we were intrigued at the new concept and menu. We visited on Friday 4/6 at 6 pm. Our server was very flustered. He has waited on us many times before when it was Grape and he was great. We ordered 2 glasses of wine and the queso dip. The dip was very runny and the chips were nothing special. We finished our wine and waited 20 minutes for our server to come back. Each time he was in a rush. We ordered more wine and placed our food order of 5 sliders and 3 deviled eggs. Unfortunately we never got the food. We had now been there almost an hour and a half. The table next to us got 5 sliders and they arrived after us. I suspected that this was our order but 2 of the 5 sliders were supposed to be on lettuce wraps. They gave us the order because they only ordered 3 sliders. As we sat at our table looking at the sliders and trying to figure out what was what, still waiting on our server. At this point we decided that it was time to leave. There was no way we were going to wait to get the correct order. And nowhere in sight were the deviled eggs. How long does it take to put deviled eggs together?  I tracked down our server at the bar and said we wanted to cash out and couldn't wait any longer. Even then, he never came over so we left cash on the table for the wine and queso. What was really missing was the owner. I never saw her anywhere, unless she was cooking in the kitchen which I highly doubt. We can't come back to this mess again and I believe that this place will close down."}
{"text":"Stopped to have a glass of wine with some colleagues out of town. Sat on the patio. Two girls ordered half carafe of sparkling rose. On friend orders to more expensive of the Malbec options and I ordered the super Tuscan. Both the reds were a bit warm and smelled and tasted extremely corked. The waiter didn't come back to check on us (we weren't ordering food). We flagged him down to ask when the reds we're opened. He came back and said today, however his manager did say because they are left out at room temperature it can taste a bit off. He offered to exchange however we had a dinner reservation and we had already been sitting for 25 minutes so we couldn't. Needless to say we were charged for both glasses. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I recently went back to PNPK (as I first went with my mother, we wanted to show this place to my father) and I liked the wine I had better.

We went during happy hour and I ordered three wines from the ones on the happy hour menu. I chose the Tiera Sauv Blanc, Cannonball Cabernet, and the Dreaming Tree Red Blend. I really liked the Tiera Sauv Blanc - and got a glass of wine of it later (so did my mother).

My mother ordered the Hi Jolly! cocktail and mmmmm... was it good. You couldn't taste the alcohol. It was dangerous.

Otherwise, food-wise, we kind of ordered the same things and it was as delicious the second time around!"}
{"text":"Not my kind of place to eat. I'm more triple d. This place is trendy.  I got here by playing yelp roulette. Open yelp whatever place you land on is where you eat. 

Food is good. Most of the staff is good. My waiter sucks ass. Hello you put me on the patio. At least bring me my food or how about silverware or a drink? I guess to much to ask from this assclown. 

I really enjoyed the bangers and mash slider and the blueberry bbq slider. Yummy. 

Been sitting here for 20 minutes done, wanting to order dessert and get my check."}
{"text":"My second time, the first was the Grape  and watched a visitor have a heart attack and die   I had canceled my meal so not sure how the food was but the staff was so unfriendly and with the situation and never even asked to move us or give us a complimentary appetizer or drink. Went again a few weeks ago and it seemed busy for a Friday night. We sat down got menus and water  we ordered and it was timeless by the time we got our drinks and the food was even longer. No one came by for a half an hour and the food took over an hour and it was absolutely awful. I will never be back and it has a bad reputation in the area. Don't bother too many great places to go to but not here."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight. I had been once before and was excited to share this place with my husband. In an hour we managed to get one drink and a piece of bruschetta (which was errantly delivered to two tables before ours). Service was a disaster. We literally couldn't even find our waiter to place an order for anything else and had to beg a runner for the check. Left and had dinner down the street at Spiga which was fantastic."}
{"text":"Went at lunchtime a couple of weeks ago. Ordered the salad with ahi tuna. The green part of the salad was very good. Excellent dressing, but the amount of tuna was embarrassingly small. Okay, I know tuna is expensive but I have it quite often and this is the smallest serving I have ever had. The price was maybe the most I've ever been charged for tuna too. I immediately went to the supermarket and bought some tuna so I could fix my own and have a decent amount. I'm not into \"sliders\" so don't know if I'll go back. I do like the idea of local ownership."}
{"text":"Just read the article in today's paper.  Inspiring to live through such a horrible tragedy and find a way to move on.  My sympathies to you and your family."}
{"text":"This is another Scottsdale restaurant that makes you giddy with gastronomic excitement after taking just one look at the menu. An extensive selection of meat and cheese, and flights upon flights of deviled eggs, bruschetta, sliders, fries and eclectic accompaniments. Yet it fails to meet even absent expectation. 
Located in a less than lively strip mall, the exterior exudes commercial inauthenticity. The bar area and dining room reflect end-budget interior design with red velvet lounge chairs next to purple bar stools and distractible low-hanging lighting. Furthermore, at about 25% capacity, the service was unfortunately lagging. 
My husband and I decided to start with a sampler of deviled eggs, which was to much disappointment, the best part of the meal, but included unique flavor profiles: twist on traditional, white truffle oil and chives, candied bacon with jalapeño. The tomato-mozzarella bruschetta lacked flavor and the prosciutto-marscapone-fig jam bruschetta was overwhelmingly sweet, making me wonder if the chef had even tasted it before deciding to serve in such proportions. This was followed by an unimpressive American, poorly attempted Nashville hot chicken and mediocre short rib-French dip slider. The real disappointment was the fact that they ran out french fries. Although the substituted tater tots and onion rings were cooked to crisp perfection, but the accompanied paprika aioli tasted like it was ridden with lemons and the spicy ketchup resembled week-old cocktail sauce. Needless to say my tastebuds weren't dancing for dessert. 
Although an exciting prospect and a clear attempt at creating modernized comfort food, if restauranteurs are going to move forward with a project, I would recommend a more exquisite and refined palate."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try a new place. The food was good once we got it served. We were with a group and strangely it was served family style. All sliders of one flavor came out on a board and we had to send it around and serve ourselves. And of course the $200 plus check came out  again for us to figure out for ourselvesI guess it was a manager that came out and said they would not split check. He said all restaurants he knows don't accommodate splitting a check. 

Seriously with technology today you can't tell each couple what their total comes to. This place is not for groups. Our sever tried her best but I doubt we will try it again. If you don't listen to the concerns of your customers you won't make it.


Update 4/23
Thank you for your response. We were not informed of the concept of how the food is served. I guess I am just old school I like my food on a plate in front of me.  Which we did anyway and had a stack of boards at the end of the table. It wasn't busy when we got there. 2 other tables. Yet it was an entire afternoon event. We arrived at 3:30 and left at 6:00 so the saving time element on the check is certainly a mute point. 

At any rate, hope the best for you but I doubt any of our party will return."}
{"text":"Do not come here if you  are a large group. By large i mean 11.   About an hour to pay the bill!! Manager unconcerned about customer service and did not accommadate the tab issue.  Terrible service!!!! We know tons of people that have been wanting to come here will tell them not to come here.   Waitress tried. Hand tied by ridiculous policies and management."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  They made some significant changes and totally overhauled the menu since the last time I was here.  Service was attentive, and had a real cozy atmosphere.  We couldn't find which slider we liked the most so we had probably a half dozen and split them up.  

Reasonable prices, delicious and unique food, great atmosphere, kid friendly, but also fun for adults - it's really what this area needed."}
{"text":"I have to give this restaurant a mixed review.... the broccoli salad was fantastic at a fair price, but deviled eggs - while tasty - are a total rip off @ $2 per egg.  That is $2 for a 1/2 egg.... not even the whole egg!  Sorry, but really?  Who's doing the menu pricing?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! One of the main reasons I frequent this restaurant are the employees. Marisa and her sister, Ricki are the bomb , they always remember my name and what wines I like ( some are just too hard to pronounce) The food is also fabulous! I have yet to have ANYTHING that I didn't love. 
My only concern is that word has gotten out and now they are always busy. I have met many nice people , there are not many places I am comfortable sitting at a bar alone. I am more than 
happy to go by myself and enjoy a delicious snack and a glass of wine or a cocktail. If you are in the area , check it out. I will bet you will love it as much as I do!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, as always!!! Great service. Friendly staff. Accommodating menu. This place is very  reasonably priced and, more importantly, delicious! ( dog friendly patio, which is a bonus for us). Definitely worth the trip, my new location for dinner!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend their happy hour. My wife and shared their deviled eggs, Mac and cheese and a couple of sliders. Their fried chicken slider was awesome. So were the dill pickled eggs and the wasabi eggs. Would of skipped the Mac and cheese for one of their other sliders though. So far one of the best meals this trip and one of the cheapest."}
{"text":"This was my second attempt at this place. The service is painfully slow. New staff, no one seems to know what they are doing. They are trying to use iPads to place orders but the staff admits to not knowing anything about technology. It did not work well. Drink and food orders were wrong. I do have to say that the food was very good. Everyone at our table enjoyed their food. They just need more staff that actually know how to take orders."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by PNPK ! The staff is welcoming and friendly, the food is awesome and creative and fun! Our server Connor was very kind, attentive sweet and the kitchen was efficient with our order. Happy hour is one of the very best in town and doesn't have any silly rules like some other restaurants in town.. will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been in North Scottsdale for over 10 years and never thought to venture north towards Pinnacle Peak Rd- so glad I did! I went to the happy hour with kids in tow, and the happy hour specials were great!! The sliders were delicious, and the wine flights even better! The staff was very friendly, and accommodating to the kids :) The kids enjoyed their food, which doesn't happen often at \"mommy\" restaurants! I went with a girlfriend of mine and it was perfect to let the kids play while we had time to catch up and enjoy the wonderful menu. I am so glad there is a place like this near my home, as I plan to become a regular here! Great place for a date night, and even meeting up with girlfriends for a few hours! :) I highly recommend PNPK!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight at PNPK with friends. We tried all of the deviled eggs - amazing. Our servers Cathy and Crystal were so amazing! We had the blueberry barebeque, New Mexico queso, bangers and mash, turkey meatloaf, short rib, the ahi/I can go on and on! Everything was amazing! And thirsty Thursday half price beer flights. Can't beat it. Such a generous happy hour. I don't write a lot of reviews but this place....YUM!"}
{"text":"Slooooooowwww!  Stopped in for lunch, maybie 4 tables with people.  Stood at door waiting to be seated while servers walked past at least 4 times.  Once finally seated waited and waited for service.  Finally ordered drinks and waited some more.  Got drinks and ordered sliders.  Waited 45 minutes, while other tables arrived, were served AND LEFT with no word or check in from the server.  Finally the sliders arrived, but not the tots we ordered.  Those came after we had nearly finished the sliders.

The sliders we're solidly just OK.  The best was the short rib, the ahi was also good, but the spicy chicken wasn't very spicy and was a majority breading.  My burger slider might have been good but it was cold.  The long awaited tots we're nothing special, just Ore Idas dropped in the fryer served with plain ketsup.

I like the concept overall, and the selection of wines and beers and flights is great.  I had the bubble flight which was great and hubs had a great beer flight.  Happy hour pricing is also very good.

Overall I will probably give it another shot, as the concept is good and HH prices and prices overall are appealing, except the extra charge for sauces, come on, really?"}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere.  Please get extra help. Seriously understaffed. We want you to thrive"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great atmosphere. Great service and the food is amazing.  Not to mention the great selection of wines and beers. You can even do flights!!  Def check it out. Great dog friendly patio too!"}
{"text":"Went to try this restaurant. Awesome food! Great atmosphere! Great sliders!  The wine is top notch. We will be back again"}
