{"text":"We decided to cone here because we had a coupon.  Food was okay, but I'm Italian and have higher expectations for any Italian type food I order. We had spaghetti & meatballs... The sauce was meh, nothing special, and noodles overcooked. Caesar salad wasn't that great either.  The service was ok, prices ok as well.

I guess I would rather make this type of food at home as I know it will be made to my tastes.  I'd rather done at places where they serve food that I wouldn't normally make at home (ie- ethnic food)."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and prices are a lot lower than some of the competition. My friends from Calgary love to dine here so make the trip quite often but they agree it could use a facelift."}
{"text":"Casa Mia...  Sounds Italian, but it is Airdrie headbanger teens who are making your pizza pie.

Pizza is very good.  2 chioces of bacon...mmm.

Prices are decent, they have some dine in specials.  Pretty small restaurant, could use a makeover."}
