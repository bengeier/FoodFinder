{"text":"Yum! I was at Hibachi in Oakville with my family a month or so ago and we all loved the food.

This is a pretty traditional teppanyaki set up with your choice of appetizers and protein to go with the veggies and your choice of white or fried rice. I had the shrimp and chicken combo and it was really delicious. I would argue that the vegetables were served a bit too early so I didn't have much left by the time my protein joined the party but that didn't stop me from polishing off my food. The two sauces (one creamy, meant for seafood; one soy based, meant for the chicken/steak) were delicious and kind of made the meal for me. Next time I will go with steak and shrimp as my dad and husband's beef looked very well cooked, nice medium rare. 

I would like to go back asap!"}
{"text":"It was overall a pretty good experience.  I have been to a few teppenyaki places and it is one of the better ones I have been to in terms of value and quality of the food. (Though truth be told value was really good and could be considered 4 star if groupon price was normal price).  The chefs there do a couple of tricks including juggling of tools and use of flames to create a relatively enjoyable experience.  Has it been the best teppenyaki place I've been to in terms of quality of food no, but overall service and interior was well designed and food was enjoyable and cooked well. 

Definitely recommend to give it a try at least once :) especially with the groupon deal as you will be well fed with all the food provided!!!"}
{"text":"Put simply, this restaurant is a step below places like Benihana. All the usual items are here: the showmanship by the cooks, the ginger sauce and dressing, etc. What is missing is that the quality of food is just not as good as it should be for the prices they are charging. 

The shrimp should be sliced into multiple pieces, as other similar places do it. It is easier to dip and eat this way. The steak is too thin. The undercooked vegetables consisted of broccoli(?), a strange choice, and way too many onions. The chicken, however, was quite good. 

If you're looking for a Benihana style type place then this restaurant will likely satisfy you but the overall experience is lacking something."}
{"text":"If I could rate 0 I would. Came here for a party of 3 on a Sunday evening after our usual l teppanyaki restaurant was booked full... we were seated at a griddle with another party of two who seemingly had a much smaller order, but I noticed one of them slid the cook a 20 across the griddle before he started cooking... as we watched the chef cook, we noticed he was portioning off much larger servings to the couple, and even cutting off some of our order to give them... they ordered strip and we noticed portions of our filet getting siphoned off onto their plates, when there were communal veggies they got portioned twice and we got the leftovers on the griddle... at the end of our meal, I let the server know what had happened (including the in your face bribery) and was offered ice cream lol! I didn't come here for ice cream, I came here to eat my dinner that I paid $42 for. Essentially, I paid for a dinner for 3 and was fed a portion for one split for 3 people because our 2 other portions were given to people who bribe the cook. Wasn't offered to have my bill adjusted or anything, either. I was FURIOUS! So when it came time to pay, I did not tip because the tip was clearly already in the chef's pocket; on our way out we overheard the server we had was telling all her coworkers we did not tip her. HA. Please avoid this establishment at all costs, there are much more reputable teppanyaki places across the GTA with better quality food and far less jankiness!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was just okay for the price (seafood was good) but:
1. when asked what I would like as a side \"fried rice, white rice or noodles\", I asked for noodles... when my bill came, they charged me four dollars extra for the noodles!! Apparently you have to read the fine print! Definitely did not like that it was presented as if they were included in the price! 
2. To make matters worse, my $4 noodles were extremely boring and cooked before everything else so they sat on my plate for 20 minutes while everything else was being prepared!
3. I usually enjoy friendly staff however, our waiter seemed as if he wanted to join us... no boundaries and somewhat desperate for conversation (or friends)!!"}
{"text":"I went to Habachi steakhouse and bar for lunch in Oakville with friend as we noticed that they have a grand opening special 30 % off. The service is good and the decor is very cozy. I order a deluxe teppanyaki combo, which included 6 oz lobster tail, 6 oz aaa steak, salmon, and veggie. Also come with steam rice and miso soup. It costs $39. The food is good and we had a very good time too. Afterall, we have a 30% off on the bill. Perfect lunch."}
{"text":"Really good for an excellent price! I often go here with my coworkers for lunch, the teppanyaki is delicious but their sushi on the patio is yum as well. Half off sushi on the patio! Only caveat is slightly rude staff."}
{"text":"Nice different setting and experience. Food tastes very good and they are very friendly.

So many menu options to choose and it is prepared right in front of you. 

It's not very busy there during lunchtime, but nonetheless I would still recommend and return myself."}
{"text":"Service was not fast, food was kind of over priced for the selection of vegetables included. The only really amazing meat were the scallops. Very overpriced for a kind of fake Japanese half hearted teppanyaki show.

Good place to go if you like fake Asian food. Nothing authentically Japanese about it."}
{"text":"Went here for my stepdaughter's birthday. Amazing service - Leoles was fantastic!!, great food, awesome entertainment... What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I do not know if this restaurant has good food or not.  I arrived on time for a 7 PM reservation.  Told it would be 20 minutes.  Checked in again.  Told it would be 5 minutes.  50 minutes later decided to leave.  Another couple told me they had waited over an hour.  If you offer reservations you should try to keep them."}
{"text":"A huge THANK YOU to Hibachi Seafood & Steakhouse Teppanyaki. The food was amazing, the staff and their service blew my mind, our chef was so entertaining and most importantly you made my Mommy aka \"Super Nana\" feel like a star on her special day. You've officially made it on my top 10 list of favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"The restaurants atmosphere is warm and inviting.  The decor lovely and the bathrooms are fairly clean.  We waited for a bit to get seated and then we waited quite a while for the chef to come to our table. I spoke to the manager who immediately spoke to this.  The service was friendly and accommodating and the manager comped us with appetizers to apologize for our wait.  She was friendly and fair.  The food was tasty.  I would return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I got a Groupon deal for this restaurant, so my mom and I made reservations and used it as a mother/daughter evening out. 

Even though we had made reservations, we had to wait when we arrived. While we were not impressed, we were directed to the bar where we ordered a drink. The strawberry daiquiris were ok, nothing crazy. They were made with pre-made mix and then had the alcohol added in. We did get a little umbrella in our glass though, so that was cute!

The meal was prix-fixe. Since I have a shrimp allergy they substituted with no issue. Very much appreciated! They also cooked all of my meat first so that there would be no cross contamination. I appreciate the effort the staff went to making sure that I didn't have an allergic reaction. 

The beef was cooked medium rare as requested and the salad and fried rice were excellent. The chef put on a great show and had my mom laughing. 

Overall it was a great evening. The food was yummy, great show and the location was convenient."}
{"text":"The service was amazing the server told us to try the chocolate and green tea ice cream mixed which was a really good mix. 

Came here because there was a group on and it was a nice experience m. 

Good for dates, cheap drinks and sake bomb is s good laugh !!"}
{"text":"Dropped in here last week after a movie for a change of scenery from our usual spots. Like many other we had the Groupon deal. 

The place was nice enough in terms of decor and the staff were friendly. At times they were not that prompt but were apologetic when that was the case. 

Obviously part of the appeal is the teppanyaki \"show\". Our chef was good natured and skilled with his little tricks but maybe a bit bored of the whole routine.  I am sure it still beats working at Made in Japan in a food court lol. 

The food was pretty good for the most part. With the groupon it was a prix fixe menu. The starter courses were Japanese restaurant standards Green salad, miso soup, and some California rolls. These were all pretty low quality to be honest. I've had better salad and soup at much cheaper hole in the wall sushi joints. The California rolls were very weak. I've had better at grocery stores.

The fried rice and vegetables were pretty good but really just filler. 

The highlight is the meat obviously. The steak was cooked perfect medium rare and the scallops and lobster were delicious. They give you more chicken than anything (which I could do without) but the still decent portions of the other items. I was stuffed by the end of the meal.  I finished with green tea ice cream. Again pretty standard fare. 

Like others have mentioned the place is pricey but that is par for the course for teppanyaki. Including the groupon and a couple of drinks each it came to over $130 with tax and tip. 

It's worth checking out if you want the experience but I'll probably try a different teppanyaki place next time."}
{"text":"Had a great time. First time going and loved the show. Had a great chef very entertaining. And the food was sooooo good. I had the chicken fried rice and it was the best I have ever had. The wonton soup was very good just wish there was more. I loved the food and plan on taking my parents."}
{"text":"Had the Salmon.  Came with very tasty cooked vegetables and I upgraded to Chicken Fried Rice.  Food was plentiful and tasty.  Service very good.  Will eat here again."}
{"text":"Saw a Groupon and decided to randomly try this place.
Groupon - $129 for 4 people
Came with :- 
The prix-fixe meal includes the following:
1) Miso soup
2) Green salad with house ginger dressing
3) Fried rice
4) Vegetable spring roll - 4 mini spring rolls per pair
5) A main course of AAA striploin steak, chicken filet, atlantic scallops, jumbo shrimp, and lobster tail
6) Ice cream for dessert.

Some in our party (3) had severe seafood allergy so they asked for a substitute. I had looked on the website and noted the lobster tail was $16 and the Filet was $14, so I asked for them to substitute the lobster tail for that, everyone was ok with the switch (even when I had called and asked before I bought the Groupon)... until we actually sat down, then they did not give an option and announced they would only get steak and chicken at the 'same amount' (Very dishonest move)...
LOBSTER TAIL? HA HA HA... You mean 6 bite size pieces of lobster, they shared 1 small 6oz lobster tail between 3 people ( 2 others were there with a groupon as well), I received 2 scallops, the size of a quarter & dime and three shrimp, the size of a loonie... At the discounted Groupon, sure it was worth it as a taster menu, but not as a meal... and even less so at their original prices.

This was your opportunity to gain return customers... to put your best foot forward and prove to those in my party that you were worthy of paying regular price to return... and my did you fail.

Will I be back? Certainly NOT

Benihana... Iron Chef... lets do this... Hibachi NO WAY.

Atmosphere - 3/5 (It's a pretty restaurant)
Drinks - 2/5 (Below par)
Food - 2/5 (It's ok, but nothing special)
Service - 3/5 (Chef barely even spoke to the table or interacted at all)
Show - 3/5 (Vaguely amusing)"}
{"text":"Hello my fellow Yelpers ! 
So today's review is about Hibachi steak and seafood .
Well my experience was pretty good i have to say !
We came here with a group of 12 today !!
We had a fantastic host and waiter ! Great chef who cooked a fun meal for us ! I have been to a few other hibachi places in the states ,we're I must say the show might have been a little better as to entertainment......BUT this place was great ! Not as good but great non the less . Chef did a great job cooking and entertained to his ability .
I had the seafood combo was pretty tasty .
Few of my friends had the steak and they enjoyed it !
Definitely a great place to bring a date in the evening if you wanna get lucky or the family for a bday event or something .....all in all ...here's my break down .

Atmosphere --- 9 out of 10 
Service.         --- 10 out of 10
Food.            ---  8 out of 10"}
{"text":"Best service I've had anywhere. Our server, Chatelaine was, to quote my son, excellent. Food was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Food was okay, the meat was cooked perfectly, salmon was slightly overcooked. We enjoyed the chef, he was very entertaining. Place was clean. Be prepared for lots of kids. We were eating at 7:30pm on a Friday night and the place was full of kids, at our table alone we had 4 kids under the age of 9. Staff should try to seat people with kids together and adult couples together. I don't want to have to watch what I say because there is a 7 year old beside me. One of my other hates is plastic cups for water, you know the kind they use at daycare only larger. I will try it again, have dinner later, request to sit with adults and ask for a glass for my water. Perhaps those accommodations will warrant a 4 star next time."}
{"text":"Came here on a Groupon and thought it was great! Had a huge meal with soup, salad, spring rolls, 5 meats (chicken, steak, shrimp, scallops and lobster tail) and ice cream. Awesome groupon for $65 for two people. 

Plenty of parking and easy to get to off to the QEW. 
We were seated quickly and appetizers came quickly as well. Everything moved pretty quick. The teppenyaki show was good and everything was well cooked. 

Definitely coming back! May snag another groupon before it expires!"}
{"text":"After searching for a new gluten free dining experience, we decided to try hibachi since there was a good groupon for it ($65 for two). We called before buying the groupon to make sure they could accommodate me, and the woman on the phone literally said \"everything is gluten free except for the soy sauce and we have gluten free soy sauce. Everything is gluten free\". So we booked a reservation (again highlighting gfree), bought the groupon and headed out. 
When we got there we reminded the hostess that I was gfree as well as our server and the cook.
The server brought out sauces and I didn't get any bc surprise ... They contained gluten. Hmm, I thought everything was gluten free? I also didn't get the soup that was part of our deal or the spring rolls. Also, contained gluten. They did accommodate the salad with a simple dressing, though I'm fairly certain it was Kraft Italian dressing. Tasted fine anyways. 
So the chef comes to the grill and asks who is gfree, so I tell him it's me and he smiles and says ok, we'll accommodate you. 
So he starts cooking with their fancy spatula and knife swinging and cool fire tricks (which was all great) but then he squirts soy sauce all over the rice. I looked at my husband and said \"I'll bet that's regular soy sauce\". So he went and complained. The good part is that another chef came to the grill behind the one our chef was working on and made all of my food separately with gfree soy sauce. The bad part is that had I not been paying attention at that moment, I could have ended up really, really sick. I don't understand how the chef forgot in a matter of minutes, but at least they made it right. 
The rice and veggies were great. We also had steak, which was amazing, lobster, scallops, chicken and shrimp. The meats were all good except for the shrimp which tasted like mould (which I had the husband confirm, as I initially thought I was crazy). 
To top it all off, we were charged an automatic 15% gratuity. It made me even more frustrated because I am a good tipper but I don't like when tips are automatically added - especially when there is no warning about that. I also don't like paying a prix fixe menu for a bunch of food I don't receive.
Sigh. 
Gluten free accommodation should mean replacing the items that have gluten with items that don't, not just removing items all together and saying sorry (or in this case saying nothing and we had to ask). 

I'm honestly only giving two stars because the chef did make it up to me by cooking my food separately. We definitely won't be back. However I will say this. If you don't have food restrictions, you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"Never judge a book by it's cover comes in to play with the new Hibachi location!

My first impressions of this place when I noticed it was that it looked kind of... inauthentic? Suburban? Chain-y? I'm not quite sure, but the outside certainly doesn't do it justice. Once inside I found an elegantly designed restaurant with stainless steel, leather, and fancy wall treatments. Definitely not what I was expecting! 

There are 6-7 teppanyaki tables here, with room for 8(ish) guests each. I did notice some bar seating, but not a lot - and really why would you come to a teppanyaki restaurant if you didn't want the teppanyaki! 

The menu has 13 options, and each come with green salad, miso soup and steamed rice, which can be upgraded to two other soup choices (hot & sour and wonton) and vegetable or chicken fried rice. 

We both upgraded to vegetables fried rice and wonton soup, and I had the filet (because that's what you should ALWAYS get at teppanyaki places) while my fiance had the steak/chicken combo. Spoiler alert, mine was better. We also shared the chicken karage appetizer.

While the appetizer was super mediocre and I wouldn't order it again (think skinny dry chicken strips), the rest of the food was pretty good! The soup and salad were on par, the fried rice decent (but not fabulous) and the veggies were good (except for the mushrooms, because I hate mushrooms...), and my steak was UNREAL!!! 

I think the main reason I like filet from teppanyaki so much is that I can ensure that it's going to be as rare as I want it to be (SO RARE), and so it's melt in your mouth delicious. 

As for the show, it was on par with others I have seen, and maybe even a bit better. They turned off the lights at our station and had a little fire show at the end - another table across from us had our chef, and I noticed that they had a bit of a different show, so good to know there is variety. 

Overall I thought the service was great (especially the cook), the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was spot on. I hope that people look past the exterior and give this place a try, because I really like having delicious steak walking distance from my house. Really. Like it. 

And thanks to be given a handful of 20% off coupons on the way out, you know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I got a groupon deal for this restaurant.  Originally I wanted to try it since it was located near my house and haven't had a chance to try it since I moved here. I bought the groupon for the Burlington location however the Burlington location is currently being renovated so I was able to use the Groupon for the Oakville location on Cross Avenue. The groupon deal for $70 you get a 7 course dinner for 2 what a great deal! You get Miso soup, a salad and California rolls to share. We ordered an extra appetizer tempura shrimps. Then for the main you get vegetables friend rice, grilled vegetables, chicken , steak, shrimps and lobster tail. For dessert you get a choice of ice cream flavour. Our chef did a lot of fun tricks at the teppanyaki table, very entertaining. The food was delicious.  Also my boyfriend and I were starving! I found the portion was small but you get a taste of everything. I found Beni Hana inside the Fairmont Royal York Hotel  gave bigger portion but that Groupon deal was $99 for 2 people. All in all food was tasty and flavourful. The service I have to give a 5 star! Our waitress was fast and friendly. The set menu there's no substitute but when I told her I didn't like raw sushi she made an exception and substituted rolls for California rolls. In the end we paid for our drinks the extra tempura appetizer and the tips. Great meal will for sure come again. I only gave 4 stars due to the portion size."}
{"text":"I went here because I bought a coupon from groupon. Our chef cooked the food infront of us was not very enthusiastic! Which made his little performance less enjoyable.. He did everything half assed. And he always gave the left over to this one girl which was annoying... 

The food was okay, not much flavor. I tried scallops,shrimp,lobster,steak, and chicken and the sea food was over cooked and rubbery! The steak was okay..the only flavoring it had was this garlic butter they put on everything. The chicken was nothing special chicken with butter... They really need to learn to marinate their meat! To really give it flavor.  
 
I would not come here again, especially paying regular price for it."}
{"text":"Just tried out this place for dinner. Pretty good. Other Teppanyaki places we usually go to is Yang's in Vaughan and Prince and Iron Chef in Mississauga. This place is as good as Yang's but much better pricing. I like this place the same as Prince and more than Iron Chef in terms of food quality. 

Service: excellent, very attentive but allowed breathing room, the perfect balance. 

Atmosphere: typical Japanese/teppanyaki atmosphere, but the music tonight was a bit odd of a selection, very hip/hop type, didn't go well with the decor. 

Food: 
- we were charged for tea, one small pot of tea for 2 people, they charged us 6$...it's just tea, regular jasmine tea. Seriously, if you are competing with other teppanyaki, do NOT charge for tea. Asians people will hate you...the other teppanyaki places do not charge for tea, it should come with the meal!

- we got the filet mignon/lobster/salmon/chicken deluxe combo. they were nice, let us swab the salmon for scallops at no extra charge. The food was delicious. Filet mignon was perfectly cooked to medium rare the way we like. Portion size was really big. We did the deluxe + sharing dinner and still had leftovers. The sharing dinner was a nice touch, for an extra 10$ you can share instead of paying for a separate meal, I haven't seen this at the other places. The seafood dipping sauce is good as well, it's not the boring ginger sauce that are usually given at typical teppanyaki places.

- fried oyster appetizer was just okay, the sauce made it taste worse, I liked the oyster with their seafood sauce better than the sauce meant for the dish  

Pricing: 
- for the quality, it was well priced, cheaper compared to the other GTA teppanyaki

Return? definitely!

But please add black cod to your menu!"}
{"text":"Good experience.  Food was tasty. Had lobster, shrimp, chicken,scallops, noodles, veges, salmon and fried rice.  Teppanyaki chef juggling egg show was okay. 

Staff polite and attentive.  Interior decor modern and clean."}
{"text":"If you've been to one Hibachi place, you've been to them all, really. They are always good, always fun and always delicious.

I went to this Hibachi place because I had a Groupon - they have Groupons available ALL the time, and they are a great deal. I got steak, chicken, lobster and shrimp, and it was all so delicious, but I have to admit, yum-yum sauce is my favorite thing (the seafood sauce). It's so yummy!

They are always friendly and the show is always fun to watch. But to be honest, I wouldn't come here without a Groupon because they are SO expensive. Other than that, I love this place!"}
