{"text":"Until I was 15, I didn't even realize there were other bakeries around and to be honest, you don't need them because Fragapane's is a fantastic little bakery specializing in pastries and they also have some breads and deli meats/cheeses. First off, the pastries are off the wall: doughnuts, croissants, cinnamon rolls, cookies - yes, you will love them. I would live on their chocolate cream sticks alone if it were possible. I've always thought the cupcakes are sort of dry but regular cakes you order ahead are delish. Also they have the cheapest coffee in town and good deli sandwiches made to order (no seating, though). Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Fragapane is THE place to get baked goods on the west side.  My favorite is the cassata cake.  If you don't want a whole or half cake, they will sell it by the piece, which is a good portion-control mechanism for someone who will devour it in one sitting.  All of their doughnuts are delicious and the canoli is divine.

I'm not too crazy about their cookies.  They are on the hard side and I like mine chewey.  Others like them so I chalk it up to being a connoisseur of chewey cookies.  

Open Sunday mornings and boy are they busy.  The staff is friendly and efficient and you will be out the door quickly.  Too bad there is not a place to sit down and enjoy a cup of Italian Roast coffee with my sweets."}
{"text":"This place makes good cakes. Their Italian wedding cake is fabulous. If you just want a piece of cheesecake, rhey have many different kinds. They did screw up my order once and gave me one layer cake when I ordered and paid for two layers. The owner was apologetic and made up for it on my next order. She didnt give me any money off, but the next cake I ordered was the best I ever had any where."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, with good pastries. However, the eclair I bought was still frozen. The staffs response made up for it."}
{"text":"My favorite stop for a fresh deli sandwich with a diet coke and ruffled potato chips. This place knows how to do it and keep it classic!"}
{"text":"I love this bakery! They make the best packzi in the spring. I've had a number of different cupcakes and pastries and they're always delicious. The tiramisu is to die for!  Their donuts are also amazing.  Once a month I host coworkers from out of town and make it a point to grab Fragapane donuts for the group. Although their sign states that they open at 6:00 am most days, they're almost always open earlier. Even if it's only 5-10 minutes early, it's super convenient for me to grab goodies on the way into work."}
{"text":"Donuts are homemade and delicious. Definitely better than dunkin donuts. And you have to try their sandwiches, mostly known for their bakery but these things are awesome. Check it out."}
{"text":"The four stars are strictly for the deli portion of Fragapane's! Their bakery is awful.
But the deli! YUM! I go there to get my sandwiches. The bread is delicious! They have a great french sub bread that I get their AMAZING seafood salad on. The wheat is perfect for turkey. And there is one particular lady who makes those sandwiches HUGE! In my opinion, this little place kicks Subway to the curb. They have a large variety of sandwiches and subs with all the toppings you could want. They also have a very large beverage selection. 
The bakery is not good. At all. Sorry. I asked of the cookies were chewy and was told they were...no. no they are not. If you like crispy cookies, then it might appeal to you. The brownie was too....undone I guess. The cupcakes are huge, but again, just not that great. I would give the bakery 2 stars."}
{"text":"The bakery is fantastic and the lunch time sandwiches are freakin HUGE!  You can literally make 4 sandwiches out of the meat they provide and their macaroni salad and jardinira are great... seriously large sand which at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"A review of Fragapane's for me begins and ends with:  Chocolate Eclairs.

These are the doughnut worlds equivalent of a Lay's potato chip - you can't just have one!

Happy gorging.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"Stopped by Fragapane for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised with the deli sandwich selection. I ordered the Italian sub and had a short wait while the clerk assembled the sub. The service was very polite and the clerk did a good job checking to see what items I wanted on the sandwich. The price at $5.99 is more than reasonable for a fresh made sub that was larger than expected. The pastry selection looked tempting for those individuals with a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Best bakery on God's green earth!  The deli is awesome, and their sandwiches are huge."}
{"text":"I have gone to Fragapane's almost my entire life, but lately I think the quality has been decreasing A LOT!

I used to love their cassata cake, but the past 2 times I have purchased it I have had issues. The first time it was still frozen in the middle, and the second time the cake was very stale. 

The last time I purchased donuts from there I did not like their quality. It tasted like the oil they were fried in needed to be changed. I was disappointed.

The baked goods have gone down in quality, but I still enjoy their potato salad. I wish their quality would improve."}
{"text":"I lived on the Westside of Cleveland for 3 years, and often drove out of my way several times a week to go to this bakery.  I recently moved away from Cleveland and seriously miss this place - nothing like it where I live now!

The frosted cookies are the best cookies I have ever had.  It has been a month since I have had one but can still taste the soft and creamy frosting (although it is nice and glazed on top!).

Love the cupcakes too - great frosting to cake ratio.  They are so large that they would last me two days.

I have tried some of the doughnuts too.  Doughnuts are not my favorite treat, but these were delicious.  Not greasy, just fluffy and sweet!

The prices are so reasonable, especially for what you get.  All the bakeries I have found where I live now are trying to be so fancy that the taste and portion is compromised, and you end up paying over $5 for 2 measly cookies.  Bakeries should be homestyle!

Can't wait until I make my next trip to Cleveland for some Fragapane's!"}
{"text":"Amazing cassata cake... Still my favorite when I'm back home visiting.  Great cookies and pastry... Amazing poppy seed roll.  I didn't realize how rare this place was until I moved away."}
{"text":"This place has my two most favorite food items in all of Cleveland.  The chocolate sticks and the maple sticks.  Yes they're donuts but they're so much more than that.  Little wands of food magic.  They're both stuffed with homemade sweet whipped cream.  On top of the doughy deliciousness is either a rich creamy chocolate frosting or a light whipped maple cream.  There really are no words that can truly encompass the magnitude of taste contained in these sticks.  Fragapane also offers a wide array of pastries from napoleons, to baklava.  They also have a deli offering high end deli meats and homemade pizzas.  They'll make you a sandwich on their homemade bread for about 3 bucks.  However, their cookies are a bit dry so I just stick with the maple and chocolate sticks."}
{"text":"Had a very easy experience ordering a 30th birthday cake here for my boyfriend. The price was very reasonable for a cassata cake that could have easily fed 12 people. We had a lot of leftovers! Light and airy frosting--even the guests who said they did not enjoy cake enjoyed this! The decorative touch when I asked for writing on the cake was lovely as well. Would order from Fragapagnes again."}
{"text":"Love the traditional Christmas cookies. Friendly service. My only complaints-  donuts aren't labeled and they go fast! Twice I've missed out on a maple stick."}
{"text":"Awesome service, awesome cupcakes, awesome cheesecakes, awesome doughnuts and the list goes on. Definitely give this place a try if you're looking for a sweet treat."}
{"text":"I have been a Fragapane customer for over twenty years and I hate to say it but it's gone down hill. The Bay Village location is usually staffed with young kids that could careless about the quality of their product or service. They once had to remake a cake three times before it was as ordered. Brownies are either stale or frozen. Their attitude sucks and no one seems to care, not even the owners. If I can't get to the North Olmsted location, I will not go back. Potato salad is very good."}
{"text":"Their scones are the best I have ever had! I pick them up every single time that I'm in the area. My grandfather always had them in the house every time I came to visit him. Very friendly service, a must try for any baked good needs! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Okay, I was looking for a Snoogle but here I found a Snicket and what a Snicket it was. Large flaky puff pastry with a thin layer of vanilla cream. Big enough for two. God willing, this will not be the last time I have this treat that's not too sweet.

Oh, let's not forget the great seafood subs. Other sandwiches and deli salads are available as well."}
