{"text":"The other day was my first time trying here we walked in at 4. No greeting even with the seat yourself sign. A guy comes over takes our drink order at 4:03 brings them back then goes over to the bar and plays on his phone with another guy it's now 4:10 then a girl walks in some guy I'm figuring the owner comes over and says it's shift change takes our order. It's now 4:24. So far based on the first interactions don't think we'll be back. Let's wait on the food before I post......still waiting....food arrives at 4:29 she brought the food my boyfriend food looked good. My food came out wrong sent it back came out five minutes later. The food was decent don't think we'll be back simply because of the customer service."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and have not been disappointed yet. The prices are a little high, but the food is also a little bit better (gourmet) than typical bar food. They've also got a great craft beer selection.   The employees have been friendly on each visit.   We would go a lot more, but it's about a 30 min drive from where we live   The chicken tenders are great!"}
{"text":"I'll start positive...they have a very good local craft beer selection on draft...as many Piedmont area beers as I've seen anywhere.  Sadly, I've been here three times and this place has probably the worst service anywhere in the Charlotte area.  I know they have food, but you wouldn't know it from my last visit seeing how I was not offered a menu at the bar.  They did not seem very interested in up selling or even selling me any food at all.  There were many, many more customer service cardinal sins; too mant to mention here.  Two employees openly discussing their hangovers, the \"manager\" putting someone's to-go order on the bar and sliding it to him without saying a word and turning his back on him...etc.  Needless to say, I will not be back."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Eastfield! The food is great and we have never had any issues. The menu has a little bit of something for everyone. The staff are always very friendly and remember us each time we come back. Great neighborhood spot for a drink, appetizers and dinner. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great but the Philly Mac and cheese is the bomb! Waffle fries are a nice touch and atmosphere is casual. Outside seating is dog friendly."}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers, and amazing fried pickles also the staff is great. Beer selection is pretty good as well"}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers in Charlotte! Always pay attention to the specials, the chef knows what he's doing and really cares about quality. Average service, but good collection of NC beers."}
{"text":"Food has always been good, menu changes from time to one which is nice. I like that they have some different menu items than typical bar food. But the drinks area crazy expensive. Even just the beer is very high. They have always had a  great craft beer line up. But your gonna pay for it!!!"}
{"text":"Eastfield Bar and Grill has a very friendly staff. Yummy food. My family loves the chicken fingers. Clean."}
{"text":"Average bar food with a fairly hearty price. We have been there at least 4 times and had a similar experience each time. It is close and there are not manny other options, however we may not be giving it another shot."}
{"text":"I got a $10 for $20  groupon for this place and I am so glad I did!! We had The Cross-eyed burger with a side of waffle fries. The burger was great!! It has to be one of the best burgers in town. They had shredded steak on top and a yummy barbecue sauce called \"Ass's famous barbecue sauce \". Funny name, but it was very flavorful. We will definitely go back! Could have better customer service though, there was only guy watching the tables when it was very busy, but overall a great place."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place for beer lovers. Great selection of craft beers, both draught and bottle. The selection changes up regularly so this keeps the choices fresh. The bartenders are all very knowledgable about the beers as well and are always happy to let you try a sample. The daily specials are always great as well with Thursday night being my favorite with all NC beers priced at $2.50! On to the food....menu changes every month or so, which is a wonderful thing. Great salads and burgers and the chili is some of the best around. Great neighborhood bar atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!! I am so happy that I bought a groupon for this restaurant.  I am a beer snob and they had an amazing selection of craft beer and really good drink specials on Thursday night ($3 NC craft drafts...this sold me)!  The food was really great as well and better than typical bar food.  I had a black bean burger and the pretzels for an appetizer. The service was great, both fast and caring.  They also had a live acoustic artist there that offered something extra to my date night.  I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"We tried this the other night and had high hopes since we live very close by.  First, the beer selection is great.  They still didn't have anything on draft but a good bottle selection.  By good I don't mean just big with all the usual suspects but some very well thought out items.  I had a Three Philosophers and my wife had a cider.    Service was SLOW...real slow.  It was almost 10 minutes to get our drink order in.  They were reasonably busy but not too busy.  The food was OK.  Not bad.  Not great.  I could tell my vegetables were frozen, not fresh.  I had to ask for my salad after my meal had already come.  Service was slow through the meal...ask for ketchup...wait until the waiter saw us and remembered...etc.  We plan to give them some more time and go back and I'll revise my review then.  But for now it was a solid 2 star."}
{"text":"The food is bland and tasteless Drinks  are great, but they need to work on their menu  and recipes.  For example, the cole slaw they made was drippy wet with too much dressing. They used to offer grass fed beef, but no longer....."}
{"text":"I have ordered twice now from here to go and the first time it was pretty good, so I decided to order it again. I ordered three things: a veggie burger, a tuna melt, & fish & chips. None of my orders were correct. I ordered the veggie burger on a wheat bun, with sautéed onions & mozzarella cheese, it came on Texas toast, no onions & with cheddar cheese. I couldn't even pick up the burger without it falling apart it was so soggy. As for the tuna melt, I ordered it with provolone instead of cheddar, but it still came with cheddar and it was just tuna and cheese slopped on a long piece of white bread, there was not one vegetable on it. Lastly, the fish and chips, they were almost a black color and very greasy, they were not good at all to say the least. Needless to say I will not be ordering from here again, it was a big disappointment as they did not get one thing we ordered correct & the only thing that was good was the waffle fries."}
{"text":"This is a great local spot, and we are here at least once a week.  The staff remembers what you drink, and have it ready when you come in the door.  There is no freezer, and the menu is changed on a pretty regular basis.  I've never been unhappy with the food, and there are drink specials every day.  If you're a first-timer here, come on Thursdays, they have $2.50 NC Microbrews all night!"}
{"text":"This is the neighborhood bar in my area and I've probably eaten here thirty or forty times. Never once gotten bad food and very rarely get slow service. There are a couple of small things that bug me, like my one or two favorite menu items disappearing suddenly but other than that a great reliable place with a nice social atmosphere. Good for eating with the family or meeting up later at night for drinks."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a few years on and off. The most recent experience was pretty disappointing. The service was mediocre. The brisket was charred which led to terrible tacos and nachos.  Shroom burger was great and beer selection pretty good. They need to be more consistent. I feel like the only thing that doesn't change when I go in are the waffle fries."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is great and the staff is friendly. Everything was top quality. I don't mind paying a little higher price for good fresh ingredients and great service. The owner greeted us at the door, nice touch. The basketball games were playing on the multiple TV's. The jukebox was playing too. It's a sports bar, so I'm not really sure if it is appropriate for kids (best guess probably not).  The beer was cold and very tasty; my wife had a mixed drink that she said was good.   I had a burger and it was cooked just right. The burger came with lettuce, tomato, onions and cheese at no extra charge. Instead of fries I chose the side salad and it was much better than expected. It had a nice selection of garden greens and was very fresh with a nice selection of dressings. My wife had the luau salad with chicken added. She said it was one of the best salads she had tasted in a long while.   Our waitress, Kristen, was very attentive and checked back with us several times. The owner stopped by to see how everything was also.  The place was almost full by the time we left. I'll be back for sure and it's just around the corner from home too."}
{"text":"Let me start out my mentioning...$1 PBR bottles daily...yep, daily! Stopped by here the other day after a round of gold at nearby Highland Creek. Located near Lowes Foods in the Eastfield shopping area, this corner restaurant has a nice pub feel to it. Very diverse menu with selections for everybody. My buddy and I started out with the pretzel & sausage appetizer. Came with small soft pretzels and sliced up bratwurst served with mustard side. Very good! For my main lunch entree I went with the philly sandwich, which was good and had lots of flavor, but was so darn hot I could barely eat it for a few minutes. The flavor was nice though the melted white cheddar could have been substituted for provolone in my opinion. A-OK and a nice addition to that corner of the world."}
{"text":"I went with the family and would most certainly not return.  We got seated right away and the server got our drinks and food order in, but after that it was all downhill.  The waiter was not friendly and seemed he was bothered to wait on us.   There was only one other table occupied and he seemed to know them because he was hanging out with them the entire time when he didn't have to be bothered by us.  We waited a long time for our food and when it did arrive it was not hot and we had one order wrong.  That person took a couple of bites of the food and decided that she could not eat it.  The waiter tried to still charge us half because she took a couple of bites.  He finally relented to refund the price and snatched the bill without saying a word to credit the sandwich.  Instead of issuing a refund on the difference, he refunded the entire amount and reswiped  the card for the new price.  I now had two charges on hold on my card for the next several days because we ate on a Friday afternoon.  The soft drinks came in 8oz Coke bottles.  It was cute at first until we found out there was no refills and we will be charged $1 for each bottle.  He tried to justify it by saying restaurants may give you free refills, but they charge you for more and nothing is for free.  I had two drinks so I paid about the same at other restaurants and I got free refills.  The bottles were only cool and not cold.  I was really hoping I would like this place because it was close to home.  I usually give restaurants two chances, but the experience at Eastfield Grill was so terrible I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The cook came out and inquired about my lamb burger and I told him that it was good but the bread wasn't fresh. He proceeded to debate with me about the freshness of the bread and went so far as to go get a pack of buns to show me the flour dust that was on it. Since when does dust determine freshness?? I assured him that I was fine with my choice and that his effort was unwarranted. He went on to explain that he runs the kitchen and blah, blah, blah. I requested that the balsamic reduction be put on the side but guess what's oozing all over the place? Really ya'll???"}
{"text":"YUM!!! New to the neighborhood and had this as a recommendation from a business associate.  Did not disappoint!  In the mood for pub food...started with a garden salad and a Caesar salad - ample, fresh and tasty!  Quantity outstanding.  Crawfish appetizer delicious--slapped my husband's hand for eating too many! Wings were a tad over cooked but still good.  Our server Rachel was super!  Very relaxing and enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"I'd really like to give them a 3 1/2 star rating.    They have trivia on Wednesday nights which is fun but I think it made service a little hard for them to handle. I'm not sure.    I got a Caesar salad and added chicken and my fiancé got wings and a side of Fries. His wings came out right away, my salad was next and missing the actually Caesar dressing so I had to ask for some and then our fries came out and they were under cooked. It was a good salad and he loved the wings the service was just a little lack luster.   The neighborhood vibe is cool though and they have three varieties of fried so I'm super into that. They had drafts for 4$ that night which was cool and again trivia was fun ( a little confusing cause of all the steps and such) but it was a nice time and we would give this place another shot for sure."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite \"go-to\" bars during the work week. I won't harp on how it's close to home... but it is. lol. That said, during the week I actually make an honest effort to diet, especially during the winter. Sometime this is harder than usual with all the local restaurants that offer a little more comfort-style menu. Not that you can't find comfort food here, but the \"lighter side\" of the menu is absolutely fantastic.  Turkey burgers. Salads. Two of the best types of food on the menu. Lots of variety in the dishes. Salads are portioned for a dude. You won't leave hungry if you get one. However, my dish of choice is a turkey burger with fried green tomato, balsamic glaze, and goat cheese. It is FANTASTIC.   Food could be a little less expensive. Groupons are usually a great pick up for this place.   Drink specials on most days during the week.   Atmosphere is nice, generic. Multiple TV's as per the interior, great for Monday and Thursday night football games. Outdoor seating for the nicer weather days.  Service is 7 of 10."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times - each and every time I enjoy the food but the atmosphere is soooooo loud I have to yell for people at my table to hear me.  I haven't been back because of this.....if the sound can be controlled I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love the beer selection! Very quaint inside. Lots of neighborhood/local regulars. Everyone friendly and nice. Normal bar menu  but I've always had fast, friendly service and good food"}
{"text":"Recently had the Eastfield Salad with some kind of ginger salad dressing.  It was the best salad I've had in a long time!!  Isaac was our server, and he was extremely friendly, helpful, and kept checking in with us to see if we needed anything.  Great food & great service!"}
{"text":"I dont know what happened but their food has gone from good to not so much on a pretty short time. Changed the menu again. Fried green tomatoes used to be yummy now have a flavorless hard brown breading. Sandwiches were disappointing. Very bummed."}
{"text":"This is our little neighborhood spot. We come with the family, out of town guests... and yes- Mom's Night Out! They always have drink specials, great service, clean bathrooms and excellent macaroni and cheese. What more can you ask for?! Check for a Groupon before you come!)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in charlotte!! Staff is friendly, service is quick and their beer selection is on point. The food menu is above bar food w/weekly changes and specials without being overpriced."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited today.  I had the roast beef and he had the duck dynasty.  We loved it!!  We are never disappointed when we come here.  The service was very friendly and prompt.  We have to drive from Charlotte to eat here but it's well worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Its the closest place to me to get food.  I love their steak sandwich its so friggin good.  They have a decent beer selection with a lot of NC micro brews to pick from.  Service is usually good and food isn't terribly priced.  I always hit this place up if I'm hungry and don't feel like making anything."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and except for being noisy, was very good.  Went shopping today at Northlake and I suggest Eastfield to my wife for lunch.  We've dined here several times and have always enjoyed it so we decided to give it a try.  Walked in and sign said seat yourself which we did.  Nice place although a bit noisy considering that the restaurant was less than half full.   Menus and table setting were already on the table so all we had to do was wait for our server to show up and place our order.  Server showed up shortly and explained the soup of the day to my wife. She ended up ordering the Soup of the Day which was a White Cheddar along with the Fried Green Tomatoes Appetizer.  As for me, I ordered a Panther Burger which is one of the Customized Burgers with Blue Cheese Crumbles, Blue Cheese, Bacon and Balsamic Onions and Shoestring French Fries as a side.  In about 10 minutes our orders came out which is an appropriate time. My wife enjoyed the soup and Green Tomatoes and I must give the restaurant, high makes for plating. Both a gastronomic and visual feast.  The Panther Burger was also well plated and the burger was excellent although a bit on the dry side.  Good Service and Good Food. Only complaints were that it was too noisy and no open WiFi so could not check my emails."}
{"text":"We've visted Eastfield for the last time.  Very disappointing since it's close to our house.  These people just don't get it.  I'll start by saying that the food is generally above average.  The service is, and always has been, completely sub-par.  On our last visit there was one server, one bartender, and one manager.  The place wasn't packed, but there were probably 5 tables full and 6 or 8 people at the bar.  I guess the server was doing the best he could, but my wife and daughter got there drinks pretty quickly.  About 10 minutes later he came back to take our order and I asked about my beer.  He had obviously forgot.  It took him 5 minutes to walk over to the bar and get my beer.    We've been here numerous times and there's always some issue.  No cold Corona's on Cinco de Mayo even though they're 50 yards from a grocery store.  A hostess telling us we probably couldn't be seated since it was trivia night.  Servers who consistently act like they're doing you a favor by waiting on you.  This place may make just because the area is starving for a place like this, but we've visited for our last time."}
{"text":"The beer was warm, the service was awful and the food quality was terrible.   If you're looking for a night out, do not go here. If you're looking for a place for just a drink and app, do not go here. If you're looking for friendly atmosphere, definitely do not go here.   I'd try to say something nice, but unfortunately there isn't one."}
{"text":"This place is consistently great. Love the beer selection and seasonal menus. Highly recommend any of the burgers and salads. Right now there is a sandwich with bacon jam that is delicious."}
{"text":"I am in town visiting from Southern California and with my food allergies coming out to the south has been a bit conplicated. I came in expecting a drink but hoping for some food as their menu looked exceptional.   I am gluten free and cow's milk free..... most of everything in the south rocks out with some form of butter or cream and flour. I asked hesitantly and immediately the chef came out to speak with me and ask some questions.   I could be simple and eat a burger on lettuce but I have been doing so for weeks. The chef and staff worked with me and finally found a salad with chicken on it. While my dietary restrictions were still obscure for them they went above and beyond.   Thank you guys for your help and a great meal   I ended up with the spinach salad and added some chicken on top. Eating it as I type and it is exceptional."}
{"text":"The food was bad, neither of us could finish our flatbread or meatloaf sandwich. Additionally we were up charged for a side salad without being informed. the only good thing is that we haven't gotten sick."}
{"text":"This is third time coming here and I really like it.  The food is always hot and the bartenders nice. The staff seem to enjoy working here which is a good thing! Cullen and Kalie are great.  Even with a bar fully of people they managed to serve everyone with a smile.  Me and my boyfriend will definitely be back during football season to catch a game!"}
{"text":"This is the local hotspot for anyone who lives around the Eastfield area. It's super low-key and always a friendly place to meet people who are willing to have a conversation with strangers. The bartenders are absolutely fabulous! They are super attentive, always great with a nice suggestion, and usually pretty easy on the eyes. ;) there's plenty of seating at the bar and even when there's not seating directly in front of the bar there are long tables where you can grab a seat and join whoever is around. They also have several picnic tables outside for outdoor seating on the patio but beware of lots of smokers outside.  The Philly mac & cheese is my favorite splurge meal. It's cheesy and chocked full of steak and peppers. They also do a couple cool nights with trivia and other events."}
{"text":"Great burgers and good beer. No frills, but they do have a few nice items on the menu. Get the pretzel bites as an app."}
{"text":"This is our typical Friday night date night hot spot. We love the food (get the pretzel bites...Oh. em. Gee! They are good!) and the staff is always friendly. There's always a game to watch, music on the juke and lots of people having a great time. My husband loves the beer, I love the martinis and the drink specials don't hurt one bit. Can't wait for our next Friday night date night! We Love Eastfield!"}
{"text":"This bar has a great craft beer selection. They always seem to have something I like along with something new to try. The menu is tweeked every time I go and some of the dishes are good. I like the burger selection where you can choose a chicken breast, black bean or beef burger. The apple butter w chicken is my favorite but I have allot of combos to play with. I know they have plenty of weekly drink specials w $3.25 NC drafts on Thursday. Service is great and I'd recommend this spot to anybody."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! I haven't been here since they first opened several years ago. I wasn't really impressed then, but I saw a deal for $12 on Groupon & figured \"why not\"? Food was pretty good. Loved the local craft beers on tap to choose from. The patio was full (it was a beautiful spring day) but enjoyed the inside environment. I'll consider Eastfield as a good, close to home option more often now."}
{"text":"We are a big fan of Eastfield.  It helps that we live close and there's not a ton close, but it beats all the local chains any day!!!  You'd almost miss it...it's nestled next to Golds Gym.  Go for a burger or the chicken tenders- they are both great!  The fries are the waffle kind with seasoning...very good!  Portions are always pretty good too!  There are always drink specials, just ask your server!  And often, there's Groupons!  Keep an eye out and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Wish I could say anything good about this place, but alas, it fell short. Was looking for small place charm, but ended with large disappointment."}
{"text":"I usually refer to this place as 'our neighborhood' grill.  Great food, great place to just hangout, great sized patio, great place to watch the game, go on a date , or bring your family. There's patio, bar seating, and traditional dining. I've been to trivia night and low country boil night and enjoyed both."}
{"text":"We frequent this neighborhood corner bar often and the food and service is always great. But tonight our server went above and beyond! Food was good- service was great! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are pretty good. I typically get the Skybrook. Service can be pretty slow depending on the server.  I went during the afternoon and was the only person in there. My server was SUPER slow even in an empty bar. I still enjoy. 5 stars for the food - 1 star for the service hence the 3 stars"}
{"text":"This place can occasionally have good food. The service is always adequate but I never get the feeling I \"belong\". They aren't overly friendly; they just do their job and that's ok too.   Why the two stars?  They CONSTANTLY change their entire menu. I can't stand that because every time I find something I like I know it will be gone soon and I have to start over. This causes me to rarely go there. It's a shame because they are so close.   They do often have a very nice beer selection though."}
{"text":"You can't beat the menu. We eat here about once a week. The Shoestring Nachos (pulled pork, queso, fries, pickled onions) are my favorites. I also love their Thai Ginger wings. The Shrimp Caesar wrap is perfect and so is the Mahi Wrap. We're not big drinkers, but there's PLENTY of awesome choices. The service has gotten way better over the past year. Casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place sucked. Food was overpriced and not very good. Service was super slow. The waitress forgot we were even there after she initially brought the bill. Even though they weren't very busy it took almost 45 minutes to get our food order. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"First off, I moved into the neighborhood about a year ago. It was a beautiful summer day and my husband and I were walking around the area to get acquainted with our new home.  We got hungry and decided to stop in the bar for a quick bite during our walk. I go inside and it was an awkward atmosphere of quietness, only one couple in their 40s dining, and two unfriendly looking guys behind the bar. Everyone looked miserable. I asked one of the guys for a menu and he hastily responds for me to pick one up myself by the door. That was it, I never stepped foot in there again for over a year. I hate bad service like nails on a chalk board!  For the past few months I did however notice a change in the atmosphere at the bar as I pass it each day jogging around the block with my dog.  The place seemed to always be packed and people seemed to be having fun.  My brother wanted to grab a drink yesterday and suggested we go to Eastfield. I reluctantly agreed. Best decision I've made!!! Turns out they are under new management! The service is excellent. They are friendly, fast,  and even accommodated my labrador by bringing him water. (P.S. they have a pet friendly patio)  The food is standard bar food, not spectacular but still solid good food. I loved the fried pretzels with white cheese dip. Who goes to the bar for just food anyways?! This will definitely be one of my regular spots for hanging out and grabbing a drink.  I loved that the crowd is also more diverse than it was before."}
{"text":"I had ole faithful Birdsong Jalapeño!  I had a bacon, lettuce, and fried green tomato sandwich.  It was delicious!  I'm excited for the pumpkin beers coming soon!  Thanks for the great lunch experience.  I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Had the smoked wings they were tasty  haven't tried much else yet but surely will soon!"}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times and every time the food is fantastic (especially the Mac and cheese)!! They also have great service and drink specials."}
{"text":"All my neighbors love this place. Great eye candy. Regular bar food. Good selection in bottle beer. Very expensive beer selection. Occasionally have beer specials throughout the week. It's a great place for 40+ crowd. Eastfield Grill is great for the neighborhood of Highland Creek & Sky Brook area residents. It makes it convenient and don't need to deal with the headache of driving downtown. If you need a drink nearby than Eastfield Grill is the place."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff are always super friendly and the food is like an upscale version of regular bar food. The burgers are AMAZING and they have a huge selection of craft beers. We usually just get appetizers because the fried green tomatoes and pretzel bites are to die for. Seriously, this place is the best."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and always excellent! We have come on weekend , down time, lunch and dinner rushes and staff is always on top of it and very friendly. Sit where you want, booth, tabletops or bar. The have game nights , good music and nice mix of young, families, single, girls night out parties they welcome all. Good beer selection on tap of local breweries Legal Remedy Strawberry Vanilla IPA from Rock Hill is my current fav but the do rotate list to keep it interesting!  If your not into beer they have a fully stocked liquor bar as well. But let's get back to the most important thing ... food!   Apps- Pretzel bites w/ queso and honey mustard are a must! Slight crunch on outside, always warm and soft on inside. Brisket nachos- good portion - perfect balance of toppings and brisket was moist and delicious! Wings- my hubs and I are wing snobs, seriously. We like them \"extra crispy \" and rarely to never do we actually get them that way. Not only were they perfect, the watermelon BBQ sauce we chose was a perfect accompaniment and they put on side so you can coat as you choose.  Entrees - we have only had burgers and brisket sandwich but every single thing comes out hot and yummy! My son had a brisket sandwich with melted cheese and signature watermelon BBQ sauce and he was in heaven. There unique array of burgers has something to suit everyone's craving and you can swap out for grilled chicken or turkey if you like.  Bottom line, our only regret is we did not find this place sooner as it is 5 minutes from our house! We are happy new regulars and will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Was shocked by the quality of food and staff. What a find in my neck of the woods, where I can walk here basically! The server was so nice, he ran our leftovers out across the parking lot when we forgot them.   Only complaint, and a small one... is the blue cheese dressing is terrible."}
{"text":"If you are in the area, you must stop by this place. The atmosphere is perfect and the staff that works hear is really good at what they do. Drinks are very reasonably priced and the food is awesome. If you are not very hungry, then go for the duck wings. Yup, that's right DUCK WINGS! I like chicken wings but these lovely turn on an American dish is well done. Seasoned perfectly and severed just right they will have you returning just to get an order. If you want to go for a good burger than look no further than the dirty south burger served with fried green tomatoes and accented with pimento cheese. Yummy! This is a great place to hang out and chill with your friends."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I are here on a random chance Saturday night. Most things were closed in the area and we just wanted just good regular bar food to hold us over. Bar wasn't busy very quite and we sat ourselves. Darren the bartender came over after we'd been sitting there for a while. He didn't see us come in and apologized for our wait( that was totally amazing of him). Considering he was working the place alone. He took our order, we got the food which was very good. I had a cheeseburger and sweet pot fries bf had the flatbread with beef. Which was totally tasty too. Darren had GREAT customer service and was just plain out NICE. We were so happy with the experience of just general kindness. He gave us a disc for the wait - which we didn't expect and we returned the favor of a great tip. Kindness goes far and it's just great to know ppl still exist that show it. Will def go back here next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Okay, I must say I'm getting more and more disappointed with this place. This used to be our favorite neighborhood restaurant, but recently they have made some changes to their menu. It looks much smaller, with very few options. Also, they used to have these mind-blowing drunken clams (which could be ordered over pasta for and extra $3) but those are gone and replaced by drunken mussels, which are terrible. No, it's not just the clams replaced by mussels. The wine is overpowering and it just tastes terrible. Also, their marinara sauce is different. It almost tastes like it has a bbq base, looks brown instead of red and they put a TON of it in the pasta. I have a feeling maybe their chef changed or something, but we no longer enjoy our meals here. Too bad, because they used to be so good!  Previous review: I must say, I'm really impressed with how great food here is, especially when you think about it as \"bar food.\" My fiancé and I went here one lazy Sunday afternoon. We sat out on the patio. These guys had some great drink specials, $2.50 beers. They also have a good beer selection. I ordered the Southern Style burger, but with a black bean patty. It was delicious. Pimento cheese and fried green tomatoes, yum! The black bean patty itself was pretty delicious too. The side of caesar salad was pretty standard. My fiancé got the pulled pork sandwich and we had chicken fingers. I liked both of those, but the Southern Style burger took the limelight."}
{"text":"I used to go here for their grilled fish but the quality of food and service went down. Went again last week and they are good again. Not as many selections but the quality was good salad was fresh and the dressing seemed fresh. Nice local spot to meet friends."}
{"text":"Ok so they now have a full bar and beer on tap so they have that covered. Lover the Burgers and they have that down pat and they will even cook it for you to order witch is nice in that I don't like a well done burger. A lot of beers to choose from and they even had Dead Guy! The service was really good and they just needed to get things going. We enjoyed the Music but without anything to absorb the sound it gets loud when its busy. I'm not the first to mention this. Maybe some Sound Foam on the ceiling might work, and move the jukebox away from the glass. Its nice to have a grown up alternative to screaming kids at most places in the area. I will keep updating as the months go on. thanks"}
{"text":"I love the music here. I love the beer selection 'OMB'. And i love the free range black angus beef burgers. They have a huge selection of beers and great deals as well. On wed. nights you can drink 3 dollar mugs and 5 dollars burgers for that quality of beef thats a hell of a deal. Deff. a place to catch a great beer and fill up."}
{"text":"It's an average neighborhood bar...nothing outstanding. A lot of Highland Creek and Skybrook subdivision folks (da burbs).  Luckily they're opened to til 2am with a full bar (liquor).  Definitely room for more bars within that area...time will tell."}
{"text":"We live nearby and have been here a few times.  My biggest complaint is the music.  Yes, I could pay to play the Juke box, but if no one is playing it, the regular music is a somewhere between headbanging and screeching rock.  I don't mind rock and pop & general alternative music, but the screeching and yelling is annoying to a general audience and one song kept dropping the \"F\" bomb with children in the place.  Most in the immediate vicinity are in the 40+ crowd, they need to embrace this fact or they will loose their locals.  Food is average.  Menu changes occasionally.  The last 3 times I ordered the Strawberry and Blue Salad and they have not had strawberries each time.  HELLO it is summer getting fresh strawberries at the grocery store in the same parking lot would take 5 minutes or less. Between two of us, appetizer, meal and a few drinks we spend close to $50 plus tip.  Just play some music that can be appreciated by a general audience at all times and keep the menus current with what you plan to serve.  I do understand that occasionally you may run out of something, but 3 weeks in a row?"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers on this side of town... even the leftovers was equally as good! Staff was friendly, and the sour skittle shot was awesome sauce! My new neighborhood go-to! What you waiting for... Try it!"}
{"text":"I have never been dissatisfied with the food or service at this place. This is nearby so we always get the groupon when it is available. They have a great selection of beers (which I love) and mixed drinks (which my boyfriend prefers). The appetizers are always good. Recently we had the pretzels, which I thought were tasty (although nowhere near as good as the pretzel at VBGB. Seriously - if you love pretzels (like ME!) go to VBGB immediately to get that pretzel)!   Every meal we have had here, we enjoy. The BF loves their burgers and waffle fries. He said the macaroni and cheese was ok (\"kinda soupy but tasty\"). I like the salmon caesar wrap (sub chicken in place of salmon). The food is always fresh and reasonably priced, especially with the groupon."}
{"text":"Great food !  A little pricey but awesome food  and better bevs! Worth the trip. Great place to meet folks!"}
{"text":"Good Food and Good Selection of Beers  The quality of the food is great and the staff is friendly. The salads are great and the burgers are as well. The produce and meats are purchased locally and better quality, something you see in a more expensive restaurant. Great local hangout."}
{"text":"Decent bar, especially for the area.   Service was great. Me and the boyfriend sat at the bar and got served by the manager. He was really cool snd even let us sample a couple beers. Service was probably the reason I give 3 stars and not 2.  Food is just okay. You can tell that most of the items are not made in house. The prices don't really reflect that.   We ordered the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer. They were just okay. The sauce was a little weird and just wasn't my taste. For the meal, I ordered a burger and the boyfriend got a Philly. His Philly was tiny! Food wasn't bad but wasn't memorable. Fries were good as well as the macaroni and cheese. We had a groupon so it wasn't a bad restaurant trip."}
{"text":"Pros - Great burgers, good craft beer selection, daily drink specials Cons - Server needed some fine-tuning on his training  The wife and I visited here for the first time on a Saturday evening. We sat outside and the patio area is set up for both dining at the front with tables and then a larger lounge-type seating area towards the back where a group can sit and have drinks.  The burgers were very good (about $10.50 apiece with a side) and came out fresh and hot, as did the waffle and sweet potato fries. We were told the restaurant changes its menu somewhat about every two months, so it might not bode well for return visits where you're hoping to revisit a menu item you enjoyed.   The beers were reasonably priced and they had a decent selection of craft beers (Guinness cans were on special for $3 apiece).  The only area we found lacking was our server. He wasn't horrible, but he did need additional training. It was several small things - we had to ask him how the burgers were prepared (medium, medium-well) instead of him offering that info or asking us how we'd like them cooked. When our food arrived, he didn't ask if we needed anything (ketchup for the fries, for example). The table next to us (with a different server) went and got their own condiments from inside. My wife asked for a second beer and the server left without asking if I wanted another as well. I caught him the next time by and asked for another. He ended up bringing mine and didn't bring my wife's. He either forgot she ordered one or never heard her say it to begin with. Again, nothing major, but it did detract slightly from the experience.  Having said that, this seems like a good place to go have a beer(s) and some good bar food, then head over to 201 Central (Harris Teeter's specialty wine and beer store in the same parking lot) to do some shopping."}
{"text":"The service was very good. We sat at the bar area, and our server was attentive and very friendly.  We ordered the nachos for an appetizer and were kind of surprised to see that they were fries.  They were good, however, for $9 I think they could have a bit more to them.  We also got pretzel bites, which were amazing, a bacon cheddar burger, which was pretty good, and cowboy burger, which was unique and again delicious.  All in all, the food was very good.  We also love the fact that we can sit outside on a nice day, which is what keeps us coming back.

{"text":"The drink specials were wonderful and the outdoor patio was very inviting!  We spoke with one of the owners and he was a very nice guy (down to earth).  I have never had any of the food from there, but from what I heard it's good and compliments the drinks well.  I will definitly be going back again and I suggest you give this place a try if your looking for a chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visited Eastfield upon recommendation of a co-worker.  The food was as good as it was described.  I took the two kids.  They had chicken fingers (tasted delicious) while I had the Cajun Shrimp and Pasta.  Just my kind of dish.  Seasoned well with a a little more than a hint of spice.  The dish was served with salsa fresca, roasted red peppers, and balsamic onions in a Cajun cream (not too creamy) and I was delighted to have a great dinner.  Our servers were kind but at one point they disappeared for a while and I had to go looking for them!  We went on a weeknight to avoid the weekend crowd.  There were folks at the bar but it was a nice quiet crowd (it was still daylight)!  I recommend Eastfield for a quick, hot, delicious dinner in the neighborhood with the kids."}
{"text":"Fried green tomatoes are consistently delicious but everything else is nothing to write home to mom about. It's a nice local spot where you can expect decent service, good food and fun activities through the week in the evenings. We visit semi-regularly and will continue too.  Love the dog friendly patio.  Would get 4 stars is food was better."}
{"text":"I love Eastfield Bar and Grill. It is right in my neighborhood, and their food is delicious. I highly suggest changing your side to the mac and cheese. It's so good. I don't eat burgers, but all of their burgers can be made with turkey burgers. I think you can also choose chicken and a blackbean option. This means, all of the different ways to have a burger are available to people like me! Their sweet potato fries are also delicious.  If you're looking for a place to watch a game, this is also a great location. They have several TVs around and show all the Panthers games (and more). They have an awesome selection of local beers as well. If you're in the area, I highly recommend visiting!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and waffle fries. I tried a grilled chicken sandwich with American cheese and sweet potato fries, today, and it was just as great!"}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders in Charlotte and a great beer selection!"}
{"text":"Found a bug in our beer and a hair in our food. Nothing was taken off bill either and charged us extra for ranch and honey mustard. Owners were sitting behind us didn't do and say anything to us. Have pictures to prove it."}
{"text":"I've reviewed this place before. A few years ago, before the name changed slightly.  Either way, me and my family LOVE this place! We've been coming here for years. Food is ALWAYS delicious.  This hole in the wall deserves a spotlight! Food is always fresh and hot. Well cooked. Flavors are always on point. Menu items are innovative. Although small, the menu offers something for everyone, including kid friendly options, seafood options as well as vegetarian options. I love that the menu changes but I do miss some dishes dearly. (Oyster po boy and BBQ pulled pork potato boat).  I've had too many things over the years to list them all.  But fried pickles, waffle fries, and all their fish are just a few of my favorite things.  Oh and lest I forget, beer selection is great!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. Turkey burger, sweet potato fries and a drink for around eight bucks. And the food was excellent !!!!  A great place for lunch"}
{"text":"Food definitely deserves the 4-stars, but the prices are on the expensive side. Everything is a la carte. A sandwich will cost around $10. I had the salmon sandwich and would definitely order it again when I come back. Expect to spend around $20 + tips if you order a sandwich, beer, & a side."}
{"text":"My wife and I fell in love with this place about a year ago and would go once a month for a night out. I really enjoyed it because of the different types of food that was available as well as the quality. Last night we went out and we had a good time and the srevice was very good. But the food has gone down hill. Fried pickles were soggy and the menu was changed to be primarily burgers. That was a big let down. There are lots of placed to go for burgers in this town and we liked EBG for the variety. It appears to me that they are taking food from the other restaurant they own and implementing on this menu. I am not giving up on this great place with great service I just hope the food makes a comeback. Beer variety and specials are awesome!!!"}
