{"text":"Food was fresh, tasted great and was well presented. Very cozy and clean environment, and very friendly service. Also, I like the privacy of the booths. :)"}
{"text":"Went: 7:30 pm Thu May 21 2015 (6th couple date) Ordered: 12 pieces sashimi platter and eel roll Cost: incl. tax and tip $25-30 My gf's input: It's quiet and cozy.  The servers are very attentive. The shashimi is fresh. The eel roll is perfect. The layers of rice, avocado, and eel is just right. This was our first ever middle of the week date, though we were together with a group of friends on New Year's Day. We went to a restaurant near her house. I was addicted and needed to see my girl more and more. Bottom line: I would definitely come back. Good sushi does not really taste that different from other places that do it well. This is one of the better sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"Price is comparable to any other sushi restaurant. Went for lunch on Saturday, not busy (but that could be weather wasn't the greatest after hurricane Sandy), waitress was very polite and attentative, Ordered small Sushi boat, and food was excellent and fresh, and chilled just right so you they've chilled it to kill any harmful bacteria. Sushi didn't have excessive rice, except on the nigiri. Sashimi was also cut  with good width, not overly  thick and not too thin.They served us a free hand roll, salad and miso soup, even though it doesn't come with the boat. Dessert was fresh orange and hand cut green apple designed to look like a swan or bird. Very thoughtful and skillfully done."}
{"text":"This is one of our regular spots to get take out from. Their fish is always fresh! The selection is good. I especially love the rolls without rice.  The staff is so friendly and the chef; if you get a chance have a chat. He's a great man :) ex-military who's traveled lots and knows a lot about fish hehe, where to get the best and so on..."}
{"text":"For food I would give them a 3, for service I would give them a 4.. The lady working here was very nice.  I went for lunch with a friend and my boyfriend. They have lunch specials here for about $14 with tax. There are cute booths, but the place wasn't very busy. I ordered a lunch special that came with 8 spicy salmon and 8 spicy tuna. There was a sweetness to the sauce that I wasn't particularly fond of. I was still hungry after, but because of my limited time I didn't order anything else. I tried my boyfriend's philidelphia roll. It was big and tasted good but I wasn't the biggest fan of the rice.  We were given a cute cut up orange for dessert.  If other sushi restaurants hadn't popped up in the area, I would visit this one a lot more. That being said, it wasn't my favourite, but I'm glad I tried it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Japanese restaurant!  My Sweet portion of Friday routin.  The restaurant that had the best fish quality in Vaughan. My favorite dish is  assorted sashimi Don.  Quality is good compare to the price."}
