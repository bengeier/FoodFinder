{"text":"The build your own breakfast burrito is a team favorite! The BYO salad and green chili chicken soup are pretty awesome if you're looking to keep it light for lunch. Some menu items are a bit over priced for what you get but overall, it's a convenient meal when there's a lot of work to be done!"}
{"text":"I like the Bistro for what it is. It is a much better workplace cafe than others that I have experienced.  Bfast burritos are a solid choice. They have Thursday Chef's Table specials that are usually very good. Prices are fair and Gaston, Cindy, and Yadira give great customer service. 

They should offer bfast pizzas every day, though!"}
{"text":"I work in one of the buildings next door to where Rev is located and have been there a handful of times for the build your own salad when I did not bring my own lunch to work. When this place first opened the salads were delicious! Today I paid $6.11 for a salad and it was NOT impressive. I got maybe 1 oz of chicken which did not even appear to be white chicken breast. I got a little sprinkle of cheese and smattering of crouton crumbs on top. The balsamic dressing was fine, but that's about it. Very disappointing lunch today..."}
{"text":"**I have amended this after my most recent experience. The service and food was much better.

I'd still recommend Subway, Pizza Hut, or anywhere else first. The only reason I keep giving it a try is that it is within walking distance of work and it has more options that the other cafe across the street"}
{"text":"I work in the office building directly across the parking lot from Rev Bistro. I frequent Rev Bistro 2-3 times a week for breakfast. I always get the breakfast burrito and a soda. Gaston, the chef who makes my burrito, knows what I want when I walk in and starts making it immediately. Anna, the cashier, knows what I want also. Both of them, along with all the crew, are always friendly and I really enjoy taking my break to walk over there and get a really good burrito for breakfast. I have also had lunches there and all I can say is that I have NEVER had anything bad from Rev Bistro."}
{"text":"This place is inside the University of Phoenix building so it's very convenient if you're here for a class. Their prices are super reasonable and they make food pretty quickly. Quality isn't stellar. We got pizza which you can customize with any toppings you want. Sauce tasted like Ragu and pizza was just okay. Convenience and price are the redeeming qualities here."}
{"text":"A quaint and sufficient cafe located at the ground floor of the University of Phoenix building.

Fair prices, decent customer service. An adequate selections of fresh and packaged food, already prepared and ready to serve as a quick bite of food replenishment.

Every week, the Rev rotates between different menus, so it is quite common to spot a culturally-rich entree from time to time! This is a welcomed break from the monotonous \"caf√© menu\" that we have become overly accustomed to. A few of the house specialities that the Bistro offers are:  personal pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, and salads. They also offer a decent breakfast menu as well, such as burritos, combo plates, bagels, fresh fruit, and Parfaits. 

There is ample seating, with a hallway that contains chairs and booths. On the other end is a fairly large dining area, with wide tables that provide a sufficient environment for colleague discussions. Kudos to the board games that are in the corner!

The Bistro is an excellent place, which only receives a 4-Star rating solely for the quality of the food ingredients. When you take the price factor into consideration, the Rev Bistro is away opportune setting for a well-deserved break."}
{"text":"This little cafe tucked into the University of Phoenix #6 building is a jem! I was here for 4 days, Rev Bistro kept me going. 

Four mornings in a row I came here for breakfast. Besides making me my Starbucks Vanilla White Mocha, they had fresh fruit and breakfast burritos. A special thanks to Anna who make my coffee perfectly every day. That really got my day started on the right foot.

I also came down here for lunch 3 days that week. Once I realized how good (and inexpensive) their lunches were, there was no reason to venture out of the building (except maybe to eat on the patio by the lake).

Pizza was my go-to lunch. They had lots of other great options, but a made to order personal pizza for around $5. You couldn't beat it! I may have been tired after 4 days in a classroom, but I certainly was not hungry. Thanks Rev Bistro!"}
{"text":"Todays special was amazing! Offer more options like the mashed potatoes, asparagus and pork loin we had today. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Apparently, this place in the University of Phoenix building is brand new or just reopened, so going to break it in with a Yelp review.  

Looks clean, with a somewhat smallish selection of cafeteria-type foods.  Friendly service.  I opted for the flatbread pizza.  They top the pizza, and put it in this conveyor-style oven (similar to some toasters I've seen at college cafeterias hotel continental breakfast rooms.)  Quick and fast preparation, very cheap price, mediocre, salty taste.  Drinks are fairly pricy for the amount of soda you get.  Refills are worth almost as much as the full price drink.

Not bad.  Good if you work in the building and you forgot lunch at home.  You would do better getting a drink at QT or Circle K on your way in the morning.  They close early on Fridays."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Super good food for good price. They have nice clean vibe inside. Their gyro are setup up subway style make them your own way really good"}
{"text":"I would have expected more price gauging since it's the only cage inside of UoP but prices were actually very fair.  The breakfast burrito was delicious and the personal pizza was cooked just right! This placed saved me a trip from having to leave for lunch."}
