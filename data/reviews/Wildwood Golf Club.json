{"text":"I had my wedding at Wildwood in August 2017 and would definitely recommend Wildwood to any friends or family looking for a location for their event.  Bridget was very helpful and kept my bridal stress to a minimum leading up to the day and then on the actual day she kept everything in line and helped everyone stick to the timeline! The rest of the staff was also very kind and attentive. Everyone has been telling us how amazing their food was since the wedding! One of the best days ever thanks to Wildwood Golf Club!"}
