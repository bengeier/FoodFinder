{"text":"I had the Parotta (special south Indian fluffy bread) with Vegetable Kurma today for lunch and it was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten! The bread is amazing and the spices in the kurma were perfect. Everything was so delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"Was fantastic. Great food truck directly across from my apartment building. I work in South Charlotte so I'm not normally uptown during lunch to sample the food trucks. Great roti and vegetable biryani and cinnamon spiced root vegetable puree. Good service too."}
{"text":"I'd never heard nor seen of this truck until word was sent to my job's building that they were in the area that I decided to make a visit.

They had a menu of three (or four?) options. I went with the vegetable biryani plate which came to $7.50 and about one minute later, my food was ready. When I opened the box, I was very disappointed to find that there were no naan slices included. The meal was piping hot but not having any naan to scoop up the vegetable mixture was a big let down.

Service was quick and friendly, however, they do not offer enough that makes me want to come back."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Everything I tried was tasty. Parotta-Chicken curry, nice thick sauce which is how I make mine at home. Chicken 65 is new to me but tasted like I imagined I guess, spicy little nuggets. I liked the red onion on top. The curry came with garlic naan so no complaints there. The young lady at the window was kind enough to explain what I was getting and I appreciated it. I'd eat here again.."}

I've been wanting to try Chennai Curries for a while now and finally got the chance today! They are pretty good with updating their fb page with the menu and location so always check there if you are having a craving. My bf really enjoyed the chicken biryiani when he first went but, we decided to go all vegetarian today. Found them on 525 Tryon today at 2:15p, luckily there was no line. I ordered a Veggie Combo #1, consisting of veggie biriyani, veggie korma, raita, and a rice pudding sweet for $7.50. Not bad considering they use fresh, organic products for their meals.Food came out pretty quick, not even 5 minutes I think. I got home to find the container piled high with veg biriyani which was actually pretty spicy, not as good as the biriyani in India but, still much better than the veggie biriyani I've had at Paradise Biriyani and Aroma's buffet. The veggie korma and raita were ok, a little watery. The rice pudding dessert was more on the watery side as well. I'd order a large veggie biriyani without the combo if possible, I'm sure the bf will returning but, I wont really have the chance to come back. Cheers!"}
