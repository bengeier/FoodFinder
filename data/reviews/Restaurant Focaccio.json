{"text":"They picked us up from the Sheraton. Helped us decide on wine by tasting several they offered. Then bread, salad, pasta Gigi -linguini & veal ravioli. Gigi was amazing!!!! Would come back for sure! Great service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Authentic homemade Italian food. Sergio treated us as family, very friendly. Great atmosphere, you can go dressed up or down. Clean, prompt service. A must go. Very reasonable pricing. Keep room for desert, the house cheese cake was to die for!"}
{"text":"This was the closest to our hotel (Marriott) - we had the veal piccata, veal Marsala, chicken piccata, and frutti de mar.  Veal and chicken were okay - not the most tender but the sauces were flavorful.  My son loved his seafood linguini.  Portions not very big.  Tiramisu was good.  Bread was good.  Service was attentive.  Nice and clean place."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant last minute through Yelp.  Didn't want to have dinner at the hotel again and didn't find much else in the area.  It is a bit tricky to get to (but not as hard to get to as our hotel).    The food was very good.  The place was very clean and the staff was friendly.  It wasn't busy at all, especially for a Saturday night.  But they do deliver, so you could probably stay at the hotel and order out.    I'm sure access to this area will improve, since there is highway construction going on right now."}
{"text":"This place offers excellent value. Considering the location near the airport, off a highway, it can be challenging to find an interesting place.   This one is independently run, value priced menu, value priced house wines. Food is good, nothing special. Bang for buck is 5 stars.   Good service, white table clothes. I would go again while staying near the airport."}
{"text":"I was looking for restaurants near an airport hotel, and this gem showed up on Yelp.  Upon arriving, we were kindly greeted and taken to our seats.  The decor is clean, fresh, and modern without seeming sterile.  However, as you know, the most important part of any restaurant is the food.  I chose to order the Veal Osso Bucco.  It was served with penne pasta, a tomato sauce, and simply cooked vegetables.  The flavor was great, and the veal itself was fork-tender.  The pasta was well-cooked.  Although the vegetables were slightly al dente, it did not take much away from the overall dish.  The sauce was perfectly seasoned, not too oily, and had a richness that forced me to use the bread at the table to clean my plate.  I also enjoyed eating the marrow left in the bones.  Along with my meal I enjoyed a half-bottle of the house red wine.  It was quite nice, with a hint of fruitiness and a light effervescence.  It was not very dry, which was to my liking, and paired well with the veal.  On the way out I took an order of tiramisu with me.  It was a little different than the traditional version, with a hint of lemon flavor.  This lightened it up a bit, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  To top it all off, they have a shuttle service that will take you to and from the nearby hotels.  You simply have to call in and they will come pick you up for no charge.  This is extremely useful during the frigid Canadian winters.  If I ever get the opportunity to come back to Montreal, I will certainly do my best to return to this dining institution.  I hope that they remain in business for a long time, because they are serving excellent food for a reasonable price.  Even though I had no idea it existed before today, I will never forget the meal that I enjoyed.  You could do a lot worse than to dine at Focaccio's!"}
{"text":"We were staying in one of the airport hotels and looking for a good meal nearby.  As luck would have it, the delivery man for Foccaccio was making a delivery to our hotel and gave us a discount card.  We were all glad we tried this place out.  My party of 4 all ordered different pastas (sauce and pasta).  We also had an order of garlic bread as an appetizer.  Everything was wonderful!  They also have an extensive wine list (though I only had a glass of the house wine which was very good).  Friendly service, excellent food, and a good value price-wise as well.  Don't let the location fool you.  They also seem to be upgrading the exterior.  We had a great meal. If you don't have a car, you can give them a call and they will deliver."}
{"text":"I was traveling for work so I wanted to get out of the hotel and this place had good reviews on yelp.  Normally, I try for a spot that has a bar so I can sit and eat while watching a game.  Unfortunately, this place had no bar but they do have 2 flatscreen TVs. The problem was they were turned off but no big deal.    I was immediately seated and the service was quick.  The issue was it was too quick.  I cannot stand when my main course arrives seconds after my salad arrives.  I tried eating my caesar salad as quickly as possible to avoid having my chicken parm go cold.  The salad was nice and light for a Caesar salad, but the chicken parm was bland and unimpressive.  This was disappointing especially after the server sold me on this dish and claimed everyone raves about how great it was.    A side note on the service - the salad plate never left the table until my check came even though the plate was empty. Also, the bread arrived after my entire main dish was consumed.  Not good.    It may beat eating in the hotel but not by much."}
{"text":"I would echo what Pat said. This is a gem of a find close to the Sheraton Airport Hotel. They will send a car to pick you up, so why eat at a sub par restaurant! Actually, you can walk from the Sheraton almost as fast as you can drive, and you probably need some exercise to shake off the jet lag, or train lag, (hey, is there such a thing as train lag, cause I think I have \"train lag\").  Anyway the short walk is a much needed, added benefit.  Family owned, and authentic Italian!  Henry  gave perfect service, and his recommendations were like he was reading our minds.  The atmosphere was very relaxed, and the wine he recommended was superb.  Our food was very, very good! For the appetizer we had Salsicce Cacciatore; which is warm Italian sausage, onions, peppers, mushrooms in an Italian seasoned stewed tomato sauce; it was still light, but fantastico! I had the chicken Caesar salad, and she had the Manicotti.  I loved their version of the Caesar dressing.  And the manicotti was excellent.  Good, good Stuff!   They also have a great selection of pizza and pasta dishes I see at the tables next to me, and those looked quite delicious.  This restaurant deserves a better location, for the quality of service and food that they provide.  That would make them a Montreal icon!  Reasonable prices for good food in Canada. This is a must go to place if you ever get close to the Montreal \"Turd o\" airport. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Well located for airport travellers and probably better food than you'll get elsewhere. Prices were reasonable. Food was tasty, however a bit salty, and a bit oily. Service could be improved by ensuring tables are promptly attended to when finished eating. Overall, better than average and better than expected for area."}
{"text":"It may look like a hole in the wall on the outside but the family atmosphere and the excellent food more than makes up for it.  Service was a little slow otherwise it would have received 5 stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and the staff is so friendly and helpful. There are many Italian restaurants in this world but very few legitimate and authentic Italian restaurants -- all I can say is I hope I visit Montréal in the future soon!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal and the service from the friendly staff was outstanding. We were a party of four, each one ordered a different entree and each one was pleased with their selection. Their homemade desserts were also wonderful. I definitely recommend you try this restaurant."}
{"text":"I usually come here to eat whenever I have an overnight in Montreal. My favorite is lasagna al forno w/ the bread and my favorite with it is a glass of chardonnay. The ambiance is very soothing and relaxing. It's a great place to come to for the food and to meditate your mind. Every person should give this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"They provide you free shuttle if you are around airport. Crew was great . The only reason I am giving three because food wasn't that great,  It was bland  and bread wasn't baked fresh there. Other than that if you are looking for  convenience and not that picky than its a great place"}
{"text":"Horrible service, average food, no air conditioning and we were suffocating!!  Our server failed to ask us for a drink, until we asked. Then slapped down our bill in front of me (not my husband) and stood their waiting for me to take my cc out.  All our food tasted like olive oil, poor flavour."}
{"text":"The Salad was full with oil. service is really bad. the pizza was good. waiting time is endless. but it there other customers were happy with service"}
{"text":"Last night of the trip, close to the hotel, Italian sounded good. That's where it ended sadly. Everything started out ok, but when the waiter brought out my pretty bland salad (though, fresh), I mentioned the 15% discount advertised on this app for checking in. He said he didn't know, but didn't think they did that. He said he'd ask. Annnnnd that was pretty much the last time we saw that waiter. In the beginning, we mentioned that we wanted to put one item on another check (gotta love spending down foreign money), he said no problem. We got our pizza (spinach, asparagus, mushrooms and artichoke) and wow, it had no flavor at all. Surely, I didn't expect a ton of bold flavor with a vegetable pizza, but the asperagus were from a can and the spinach was the chopped frozen kind. The sauce seemed to have been put on the pizza, but there was pretty much no other evidence of it but the red. The only other time our original waiter reappeared was to bring out the check...which was wrong. It took nearly 10 min for someone to come back so that we could explain the issue. That waiter assisted us promptly. The experience really felt cold and as though we weren't welcome. I'm disappointed because the reviews were pretty decent."}
{"text":"So here I was - cooped up in a Montreal airport hotel after a late night arrival: and I was absolutely starving. We had a problem on our hands here, so I fired up Yelp and was on my way, hoofing it to Focaccio as quickly as I could.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  While I have to imagine that Focaccio caters quite a bit to the take out crowd (which is what I opted for), the atmosphere was comfortable and inviting with fast service and friendly staff. What more could I have asked for? Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Seriously? Holy moses. This is some serious value folks. I opted for the Spaghetti with Amoroso, and expected a decent portion for $11.50. What I got was an absolute beast that could have easily covered two or even three meals, as is evident by this picture:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/restaurant-focaccio-dorval?select=AhBLIOQDXymarluRPFzdrw#AhBLIOQDXymarluRPFzdrw  Great value. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Was this the best Italian food I've ever had? It wasn't, but it was damn good, and really hit the spot considering I'd just spent several hours on a late night international flight. The sauce was flavorful and the pasta well-cooked, and while it could have benefitted from a bit of black pepper or red pepper flakes or a slightly more generous portion of ground beef within the sauce, I was more than content at the end of the meal. Single Star Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Normally? This would be A-ok, but considering the fact that Focaccio is in close proximity to the airport and provides value where they don't necessarily need to (being the only option in the area), Focaccio deserves some serious recognition. Star Granted."}
{"text":"Everyone was really kind here. They suggested a wine that we ended up really liking (we bought two bottles to go!) They also suggested two vegetarian meals (as I'm a vegetarian) and we really loved both of those. Very enjoyable. We would return!"}
{"text":"Excellent service; great environment.  I had started with the Caesar salad and the house red wine - both were very good but the highlight was the eggplant parmigiana  which was well balanced and delicious."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty. Silvio was my waiter and he was so excellent. I was staying at the Fairfield down the street and the front desk recommended Focaccio when I asked about restaurants in the area. I was just coming in from Spain, tired and trying to fight off a cold. I wanted a hot meal. Silvio recommended the Cod with capers and fresh tomatoes and artichokes in a light wine sauce, with broccoli and carrots and a small portion of pasta. It was so good - I forgot to take a pic. For my first course I had the spinach soup which was delicious. Just what I need for my throat and cough. I also had the marinated mushrooms.  Silvio was the best. He had his driver take me back to the Fairfield so that I wouldn't have to walk the 3 blocks in the windy cold Canadian night. I highly recommend Focaccio for the food, service and Silvio. He's the best!"}
{"text":"Beware! I stumbled upon this restaurant on my way to ski in northern Canada. We were staying at a hotel around the corner near the airport and decided to give this restaurant a try. To be honest, it's really the only \"game in town\" due to being so close to the airport. The service was not great. I am not sure if they are understaffed or what but our sever seemed to be all over the place. For example, we asked for the check and then had to ask again because he forgot. The food was decent but definitely not worth a $60 bill for two people."}
{"text":"As I have said many times I love Italian. When I ended up at near by Best Western I looked up the best rated restaurant on Yelp that was nearby. I ended up at the small Restaurant Foccaccio. It was Italian but it wasn't up to the quality I have had in other restaurants. My biggest complaint was the Parmesan cheese. When i eat Italian I like fresh Parmesan, not something out of a bottle. Food was tasty, but portions were a little on the small side. I would eat here again, but if you are looking for an above average mom and pop Italian restaurant, this isn't it."}
{"text":"Near the airport, it is very convenient. But food was average, lots of garlic but besides that not a lot of flavours. Service was good."}
{"text":"Mom and I were starving after our flight since Air Canada didnt even give us a peanut during our flight.  I was craving italian food so i found this place on yelp and it was very close to our hotel near the airport. Food was delicious. I had minestrone soup to start and it was a huge bowl. I had a veggie pizza for my entree. It was good but was a little cold. Homemade cheesecake was delish. Service was really good.  If in Montreal, i would go back. Very convenient if staying near the airport. Restaurant is a little hidden but Uber was able to find it lol."}
{"text":"This restaurant is perfect when you stay at one of the airport's hotels nearby. This is a modern family place with sound healthy and competitive Italian food. Nothing really fancy but all up an honest Italian menu where you can find good pizzas, pastas and salads. The Chianti is ok, worth the value."}
{"text":"family run italian joynt....excellent food, i enjoyed it as did my firned"}
{"text":"So I stayed in Dorval, which was a mistake.... Montreal... can we talk about your construction for a second... OMG!   THE ONLY saving grace was this restaurant, we were about a km drive but of course it took 10minutes to drive here.  The food is FANTASTIC, the outside doesn't seem like you'd somehow venture into a nice restaurant, but, even thought I didn't eat in, the ambiance was wonderful.  Everyone was very friendly, and had a great smile (or maybe I was late and they thought that I would skip out on my order and were super happy when I got there lol)   The food was good, I had this pasta which was a bit spicy I think the gigi and omg...WOW so happy. Pizza was nice as well, thin crust but I def. loved the pasta...  If you're staying in Dorval (I already feel bad for you!) just come here for a dinner, don't try to venture into downtown."}
{"text":"Took me forever to get waited on - by the guy that sat me!  Noticed that there were many uncleared tables, not a good sign.  Once the food arrived I thought that I would give the place a better rating but I just could not because of the slow service.  The food just was not that good to overcome the poor service.  I would like to recommend, but just can't."}
{"text":"This is a gem. Don't let the location on the south side of Dorval airport fool you.  The food in this informal family setting was superior.  The service was great -- informative, friendly and attentive to the whims of my aged aunt. Should I return to Montreal I would go out of my way to dine here again."}
{"text":"We Yelped this restaurant because we were staying at the Sheraton Airport Hotel.  The website doesn't list this, but they do deliver!  So convenient to have it delivered to our room in less than 1/2 hour on a Monday evening when we didn't feel like leaving the hotel.  The service was with a smile and very easy.  Ordering from the website was easy, and we had minestrone soup, salad, sautéed mushrooms and bruschetta. Food was ok."}
{"text":"This place looks like a ghetto from the outside, but is really nice on the inside. The menu has a good selection of sandwiches, pastas, and meat dishes as well as appetizers and salads. I had the prosciutto and melon as an appetizer and lasagna for a main course.   The melon was not ripe or juicy. The prosciutto wasn't great either. The blend was really bland and I didn't finish it. The lasagna was equally boring.   The service was fine though, so with that and the atmosphere, I give it 3 stars. It wasn't horrible, but not worth a second trip."}
{"text":"Beau restaurant italien juste à côté de la 520 et de l'aéroport de Montréal   Nous étions 5 personnes le service était excellent rien à dire sur ça :)   J'ai pris en entrée du bruschetta avec pain grillée  Avec la table d'hôte js si une salade césar ultra délicieux et savoureuse  Mon plat principal était un osso buco à la milanaise avec penne sauce tomate et légumes pas mauvais mes vraiment pas assez de viande pour le prix de 23$ en TH Dessert gâteau à l'érable 2/5  Très belle place excellent service des serveurs"}
