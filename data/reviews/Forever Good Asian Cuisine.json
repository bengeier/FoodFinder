{"text":"I wasn't too impressed.. Ginger beef was soggy and chicken fried rice had a weird taste.. dumplings were good though when they were cold."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from this little restaurant and overall the food was okay. I really enjoyed the ginger beef, it was nice & tangy but the curry chicken was disappointing - the sauce was very thin and not at all spicy. Cashew chicken was good but the chicken is steamed or poached and this makes the texture kind of slimed. I'd probably try them again but don't expect this to be my go-to spot."}
{"text":"This easily the best chinese food.   The owners are so friendly and the restaurant is very clean.    It is more of a take out place but they do have three tables to eat in if your a small group.  You won't be disappointed with this restaurant"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food through trial and error.  I find that they make great fried rice, and curry dishes. Where I you d the quality lacking was in their seafood dishes. In particular their shrimp dishes. They use what looked like already cooked shrimp (like a cheap shrimp ring). Other then that I'm a regular here when I'm craving fried rice.  Give them a shot you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Big portions at a decent price, but flavour is sub par and I'm sure they use out of date produce as their peppers have tasted off both times I've tried them.  Not going back"}
{"text":"We order from here monthly  We love Candy & Will  It's super fresh always, great portion size, consistent flavors, best ginger beef we've had Really quick at processing their orders  Discounts for cash or credit card payments  HIGHLY recommend this place"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food we have tried in the Deep South (eg. Cranston, McKenzie lake, McKenzie towns etc)."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here and first time having Asian in Calgary. Its really close by and I had my hopes up that it would be at least half decent. I went with the advertised \"meal for 2\", it was more then enough to feed my wife, my two children and I. The spring rolls were great, I've never has sprouts in one before, but they belong. The ginger beef was spicy enough for the adults and just mild enough for the young ones. The sweet and sour pork was enjoyed by all. The rice was nice too. All in all it was very enjoyable. It arrived fast, the people were pleasant and they earned a repeat client. Thanks Guys!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out tonight. The beef and broccoli was great as was the won ton soup. The honey garlic spare ribs were okay but why do they need to be breaded. Chicken fried rice had almost no soy sauce. Singapore noodles tasted good but weren't the really thin rice vermicelli and didn't seem fried. Chicken balls were a kid favourite. Hot and fast. I would try again."}
