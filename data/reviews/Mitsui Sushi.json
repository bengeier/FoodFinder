{"text":"This place is owned and run by a Chinese family, and is a great place for lunch. They have really good deals for a quick bite or take out, but wouldn't really be a place that I would bring family or friends. All in all the sushi is good and there is a wide variety of rolls, but the atmosphere is definitely lacking..."}
{"text":"This is the BEST sushi you will ever have! If you get dynamite roll and ottawa roll you will never eat ssushi anywhere else. We have tried to find a place like this all over US and Canada and nothing compares. Finally, the mitsu soup is heaven in a bowl.  Trust me!  Also, this is one of the rare places that deliver. Even if you want icecream for desert theyll deliver that too. Me and my wife absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"I lived around the area and I was excited to try this place with 4 star review. It was totally overrated. The quality is comparable to food court sushi except you pay the full restaurant price."}
{"text":"There are not many good sushi restaurants in this area. I'm glad I found this hidden gem! The staff greeted me as soon as I entered the restaurant which was nice :) The sushi was fresh, reasonably priced, and the service was quick.   PS - I overheard the staff talking on the phone. I think they do delivery as well which would be perfect for cold winter days like today.. I would definitely go again or consider ordering take out!"}
{"text":"Sushi is decent with the location taken into consideration. My husband and I were both shocked with the miso soup which was different from what we are used to (we are both Japanese). I do not know how they make it and why it has the strange sweet taste. But please do not call it a \"miso soup\". Our server was snappy. We felt as if we were being scolded every time she interacted with us. Our empty plate was snapped away without being asked. For the quality of food and the service, it is rather overpriced. I'd rather drive to downtown for better sushi and service for the same price."}
{"text":"My most recent take-out experience was lacklustre. Out of respect, I was hesitant to question what appeared to be a short order and was actually correct, no apologies, seemed as though I was burdening them. Since then there is never a second though about head to Yonge St."}
{"text":"Great tasting sushi! I always order their party trays. Always fresh, good variety. Reasonably priced. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Mitsui for a year now & they're very underrated. Hands down best sushi place I know of. Ingredients are always fresh, food is delicious, service is great & staff is nice.  They have AMAZING bubble tea! Try taro bubble tea slush with tapioca!  I'm not exaggerating when I say this place is the best. You can pick up your food or go in & sit down, they're usually not busy since it's a small joint, but you get served right away.  They even deliver! If you live in the Richmond Hill area, which is rare for any sushi restaurant. I always look forward to eating at Mitsui."}
{"text":"Angry.  Ordered sushi for pick-up.  They said it would be 30 minutes.  Just went to pick up and they said it would be 20-30 more minutes.  Zero apology.  Completely understaffed and unprofessional.  When you call for pick-up they just continue their conversation with staff for several minutes while you wait on the line.  Interesting way to run a business."}
{"text":"I love this sushi place so much. It's incredible value, sweetest staff. The bubble tea is great as well.  I had spicy salmon roll and edemame. It's cozy and intimate- perfect for small groups."}
{"text":"Okay...let's get the negatives out of the way.   They offer bubble tea selections and I got the watermelon slush. You can tell that they don't get many customers who order the slush because there were still many chunks of ice and it barely had any flavour.   The waitress forgot one of our orders and it resulted in my sister leaving without her meal.   Now for the positives!   The owner is just the sweetest man i've ever encountered as a restaurant owner. You can tell that he is very passionate and hard working. He makes me want to come back and support the business.   When they forgot my sisters order, he felt bad so he made her a California roll with salmon sushi for free.  My mom insisted on paying but he refused and said he was truly sorry and that it was on him. Such a sweet gesture and it really made my family's day!   The sushi was very fresh and generous. The tempura batter was proportionate and crispy. For the extremely low prices, I left feeling very satisfied."}
{"text":"There is a lady who works there who is very rude. But everyone else there are very helpful, friendly, and serve great food. I always order at least 2 orders of avocado salad - their house dressing is amazing! Overall, it's a good value!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's very affordable for the quantity and quality of sushi you get. Owners are also very nice and accommodating with substitutions.   10% discount on cash take out orders. This is the place I go if I don't want ayce sushi."}
{"text":"Chicken cutlet was good, service was fine, but sushi rolls seemed on the bland side and sashimi didn't taste too fresh. Bubble tea seemed kind of watered down. But did seem a little bit on the cheaper side."}
{"text":"A note posted at the entrance announces that you get 10% discount for paying cash. I told the waiter that I will be paying cash but was not given the discount. Other than that, the food was great and the service fast and polite."}
{"text":"Great good sushi - I am glad that we found this place. The staff are very polite and we would definately come again."}
{"text":"I go to a lot of sushi restaurants and this one has to be my favorite. they have great sushi for low prices.The sushi is always fresh and delicious.Their customer service is excellent, most their staff are extremely friendly. Their delivery process is always on time and transactions always go smoothly. I can't stress enough about how much I truly love this restaurant. only thing I'm not a fan of their bubble tea, other then that great sushi I recommend trying there deep fried California roll or their crispy roll. Overall amazing service, affordable prices, and most importantly delightful food.100% would recommend!!"}
{"text":"The quality of foods was meh. The portions were small.  Service was non-existent. At best, this place worth a 2-star. But why 1-star? Deceiving business practice. They advertised 10% off for cash payment.  We ordered a salmon teriyaki lunch bento box ($9.0) and a salmon dragon roll ($9.5). Including tax, the bill should total $20.91.  They handwrote $23.0 on the bill and marked10% off to a total of $20.91. They basically did not give us the 10% discount but made it look like they did.  So, please check your bill carefully.  A toonie is a drop in a bucket but the way they cheated certainly do not deserve a return visit from me and anyone I know."}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi tray!  It's hard to find a decent sushi in Richmond Hill or Vaughan area.  Try their torched salmon sushi and their teriyaki steak combo. Their fish is always fresh and they told me they use AAA grade beef and no kidding, it's the best teriyaki steak I have ever had.  Just realized they have big TVs and play the NBA playoffs live!!!!!"}
{"text":"No spectacular, but not horrible either. When you first walk in, there is an odd basement smell, but the overall restaurant looks clean.   It's decent for the price, but not somewhere I'd be running back to considering other choices around. The rolls are on the smaller side, but the prices are also low so there are no complaints there. This would be good if you wanted a small snack for a small price while still being edible."}
{"text":"Located in a plaza, the small sushi restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived on a weekday.  We ordered the mango roll, hurricane roll and a platter for 4 people. The mango and hurricane rolls were both good. The mango roll was similar to a green dragon roll but with mango sauce drizzled on the top. It was good, but not outstanding. The hurricane roll was a dragon roll, topped with torched tuna, tempura bits and dressed in a garlic-mayo sauce. The flavour of this roll is better than the mango roll.  The platter for 4 includes rolls, sushi and sashimi. It was a decent platter, slices of fish are thick and fresh but it wasn't the best we ever had.  Overall, this place is decent if you live in the area and is craving sushi. I would not go out of my way to come visit this place."}
{"text":"Good take out but the restaurant itself is somewhat unkept and feels dirty.    If it was nicer and cleaner I would give it another half a star"}
{"text":"Not bad ! The rolls are very tiny and the price is actually really cheap. If you get just crab rolls or something around that it's $3 for 6 pieces. Which is good compared to 6 pieces for $6 like at other places. They have cool rolls. I would go again because of the money wise but not the best. Average I'd say."}
{"text":"Nice place, great food and very friendly services. Servers made great recommendations with generous portions. Heard that they also do delivery and with bubble tea!!! Really cheap for the portion and this quality. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Great service and prices!  Not your place if you are looking for high end sushi, but definitely an everyday sushi place that offers a good selection.  I am speaking from experience of their weekend lunch special.  I would definitely come back and have recommended this place to others.  The restaurant is not very big so if you are coming as a big group, definitely book ahead of time.   While we were there, we saw people coming in for takeout sushi or calling in for take out as well.  If you are not feeling like eating a lot of sushi from ayce and looking for affordable sushi with yiur group of families of friends, this is an awesome place to go!"}
{"text":"Little neighborhood joint with very friendly staff.  Their Salmon Teriyaki is excellent. Their sushi is good for where and what it is. It's not a very busy place but has decent quality. Overall a good option if you don't want to drive far or don't feel like paying the higher prices (albeit for bigger portions) of the 'other' competitor one block east.  Overall and A-Ok! place..."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to find a quality sushi place this far northwest, away from the typical Asian neighborhoods in Richmond Hill.  I can tell that they took a lot of effort and heart in prepping the food. The tofu in the miso soup, for example, are diced very small with a very generous portion to go with the soup. The sushi and sashimi were all very fresh.  I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab some sushi.  Everything tastes fresh and delicious.  Price is very affordable.   The tornado roll and some of the other chef specials are unique and I suggest everyone try them."}
{"text":"For $32 you can have a big dinner for two. We could barely finish everything. Very open to substituting if you don't like one kind of sushi to another (free of charge). Nice girl worked there, good food. Pretty quiet place for the most part."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the upper richmond hill area. Great service with amazing pricing. I was greeted with a warm smile as I walked in. I ordered the sashimi boat and udon chicken dish. Food came out timely and the washroom was very clean. Food was delicious and very fresh. Not too bland nor too salty. I would definitely come back again next time im in the area!"}
{"text":"I came here during Christmas and they are actually open 12-8pm! It was relatively empty, just because of the holiday hours but we were greeted warmly. The owner of the restaurant is actually really sweet; he's a small Asian guy and he was smiling and chatting us up. In terms of food, we ordered a sushi platter, udon noodles, beef, and tempura. The sushi platter was amazing, I've been to a lot of sushi places and their fish was extremely fresh. The tempura was amazingly fried as well, 10/10.   Amongst the four of us, it was around $20 each, which was pretty good considering we definitely over-ordered. We had to bring takeout home.  Overall, this place is a hidden gem. I get the feeling it's a family owned business, and I'll definitely come back here again, just to support (and of course for the food).  10/10!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for many years (mostly takeout) and the food has always been very good.   When i went to pick up my order tonight I noticed the usual staff was no longer there and it looks like they are under new ownership.  Unfortunately the quality of food is no where near what it was before.  In my bento box they substituted the regular tuna sashimi with butter fish and the pork cutlet  was fatty and half the size it used to be.  The maki rolls had no flavour even though they were generous with the fish eggs.   Sadly what was once a hidden gem is no longer"}
{"text":"Good sushi!  Great service!  Amazing pricing!  Pretty satisfied with my dinner for 4, not only is it fresh, it was fast!"}
{"text":"So I have to come back to properly give the sushi a go.  However, my california roll loving son ate his weight... and how many places can you go that serve not only sushi but Ramen (& bubble tea)?  We came on a quiet night and yet there was a constant stream of folk coming in for pick up on their orders.  The staff were very kind and friendly - I should also say patient given the hungry duo who were accompanying me.    Value for money - not bad.  Like I said, I'll have to return to try the sushi properly."}
{"text":"In this part of Richmond Hill, this is the best Japanese restaurant hands down.  The sushi is of good quality and the price for the food is very reasonable.  The lunch and dinner specials are really good value for the money.  My personal favourite at lunch is the Breaded Chicken Cutlet bento box.  For $12 I get a hot soup, a salad, rice, a generous portion of breaded chicken with Tonkatsu sauce, a california roll and 4 pieces of sushi.  To top it all off they give you your choice of ice cream.  I definitely leave there stuffed.  The service is good and I enjoy take out from there as well.  Highly recommend this place to any lovers of Japanese food."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time on Thursday September 19th after searching yelp for something nearby to where I live.  Was pleasantly surprised.  Food was fantastic and probably some of the best sushi i've ever had - and all for a great price.  ------ UPDATE:  June 1 2016  I've decided to downgrade my review from 4 to 2 stars.  Since the new owners took over, the quality has gone a bit downhill.  They appear to be trying really hard, but it's not there yet.  Instead, I've now switched to MiNe sushi down the road."}
{"text":"Not the worst sushi I've ever had, but usually only a consideration when delivery is a necessity. The food isn't bad, but the quality for an a la carte sushi joint is lacking. I would say the level of execution is only marginally better than most AYCE sushi places in the area. The rolls are over-sauced, the rice is a little bland and the quality of the fish is a little mediocre. Anyway, if you're hungover and don't feel like leaving your place but have a hankering for some sushi, they deliver. No pun intended."}
{"text":"Value is excellent. You can get a very generous meal here for $15. Food is fresh and tasty, service is fine. The restaurant itself is a bit run down and simple but clean. Standout dishes are the chicken teriyaki, I think they use actual breast meat, the miso soup is one of the better ones, seaweed salad, and sashimi were all great. Great for quick take out, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Why most of the yoga studios I been to are surrounded by food?? After working out a sweat at The Yoga Sanctuary, it was time for lunch!   As usual, not surprisingly, I got suck into another Japanese Restaurant. Mitsui Japanese Restaurant is located at the same plaza with Orly Grill at the corner of Bathurst and Elgin Mills.   There are no menu displayed in the window, so I went into inside with Cantonese Pop Music welcoming me... hmmmm   Lunch Specials from $6 or so... fit well into my budget.   Sushi Lunch ($6.50) has shrimp, tuna an salmon nigri and spicy tuna roll. The fish was fresh and thickly sliced and shari rice quite balanced. They were surprisingly good compare to a lot of other sushi joint I been to especially at this price point.   The decoration is really basic and functional. Wait staffs all Cantonese speaking who provided me with fast services."}
