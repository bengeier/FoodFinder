{"text":"One of wife and I 's favorite places to have fun. Karaoke on thursday and sat and food specials.. And tastey also!  Biker friendly bar and staff always makes you feel welcome"}
{"text":"I love Hammers the food is Awesome., the pizza is the best ever!!! The Bartenders are friendly and live music!!! I'm coming back!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a Bar & Grill with a local atmosphere, this is a great place. If you are staying in Las Vegas this is a great stop for lunch to/from the Hoover Dam. The staff is friendly and the food is good! The wings are big and full of meat with a generous portion of ten. I felt for the price, especially versus some franchise chains it was a good amount for the money. We also ordered the prime rib sandwich which is also good.  We felt the only downfall was that the beer seemed a bit high priced."}
{"text":"Great place for karoke, love it. Love jonny cash karoke on thursdays, and Saturdays . Love there wings, and pizza  Danni and Dennis rock, one thing though get 7up not sprite, thanks."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Hammers several times. I have always been treated like a valued customer by a friendly and helpful staff. The food is above average considering it is a bar.   If you are a chicken wing fan I highly recommend the blackened wings. I tried them after one of the staff there told me they were her favorite, boy was she right on. They are fantastic with just the right amount of spice and flavor. Great for a luncheon or as an appetizer when having a couple of adult beverages with friends.   The only negative I can give is they used to have a veggie burger that was out of this world, portabello mushrooms, roasted peppers, tomato, onions on a fantastic roll. They no longer serve it, and while I do understand why they stopped as it is hard to keep fresh portabello mushrooms on hand in a bar as they are not known for upscale food, I sure wish they would bring it back, if just for me.   When the owner (Hammer) is there he always makes sure to say hi and make sure you enjoy your food."}
{"text":"I am watching TV and I see this place on Restaurant Stakeout. I think that is so funny. This guy can't figure out why his business is failing? My house is only 2 blocks from here. I am single and I like to sit at the bar and eat so I don't have to sit at a table by myself. I also like to play video poker. I went here about 2 weeks after it opened. I was looking forward to finding a new place to go. I walk in and the bar is packed. I found a seat at the bar. I was the only woman in there. All the men were looking at me like I shouldn't be there.Then I realized the pretty, young bartender was dancing and lifting up her shirt to show her stuff behind the bar. All the guys were yelling. I am middle aged and not too hot anymore. I felt very uncomfortable and out of place. I played $40.00 in video poker before I finally got a drink. I asked for a menu but never got one. I left and never went back. I thought it was a strip club."}
{"text":"Super friendly atmosphere great food. The draft beer selection was lacking. But all and all a great place to go to have a few drinks and some good eats."}
{"text":"The food was great. I had the Prime Rib Beef dip and thought it was one of the best french dip sandwiches that I have ever had. The service was friendly and prompt. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Hammers is my home away from home! Everyone here is like family and I always get five star service. If you're are getting a bite to eat, the wings are absolutely hands down awesome. This crew is always a part of the party even on the slow nights. I highly recommend coming in and joining in the fun here at my favorite bar.... p.s. Whitney is awesome, Mikes awesome too, Dennis is my dude, and Ted... well Ted you're cool too."}
{"text":"Hammers henderson best tacos Tuesdays  taco!!!! Always have lunch there don't forget to ask for the bomb wings!!!"}
{"text":"Great Chicago Coneys on Tuesday (2 for $2)... The drinks (wells and beer) are buy one get one on Tues as well.  Wings are good as are a lot of the appetizers.  Bobby and Tammy are great bartenders, but the waitress on the floor can be a bit on edge which is probably why the bar is always packed with people and people tend not to sit at the table.  We've had a few things screwed up when sitting in the dining area (plain hotdogs ordered but got the works, no fries even though we ordered them, charged for too many beers) and she has made us feel like it's our fault that it happened.  Then she tends to realize it wasn't our fault and becomes overly nice to compensate.  Biggest complaint is that the kitchen closes at like 9pm... EVEN ON THE WEEKEND!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so fun. We went for karaoke. I didn't get up and sung but it was fun watching everyone !!! Dennis is the best bartender"}
{"text":"Dennis is an awesome bar tender! Wings are awesome. Karaoke Thursday and Live Music Friday are fun. It gives a great vibe unmatched by pt's, wahoo's, timber's, and Buffalo Wild Wings. It's a true open arms locals bar."}
{"text":"This bar started out pretty great, Johnny Cash's karaoke is the only reason this place is doing remotely decent.  The owner is incredibly aggressive and will frequent the bar. It appears the stress of everyday will generally get to him and it rolls down to the staff, and customers.  The food is good until you take a peak into the kitchen (please do!) Some chefs keep it cleaner than the others, however that grill is growing something funky with all the buildup. I prefer not to risk it.  Fights break out at this establishment FREQUENTLY. I strongly recommend going with somebody.  I strongly suggest searching for additional, safer bars to enjoy your night!"}
{"text":"This bar has a relaxing environment  and the bartender Whitney has an amazing personality and is really attentive. I'm definitely coming again and I  recommend this bar to everyone to come out and have a beer and food"}
{"text":"Food is hit and miss, I noticed that the food is horrible in the afternoon (salty fries, bland meat etc..) but fantastic at night. Sandwiches are good. their BBQ ribs when they have them are a joke. I am not much of a drinker so I cannot comment on the Bar but just the grill :-)"}
{"text":"After driving/hiking the lake mead loop we wanted to find a more locally driven bar. We found it in Hammer's. Both owners greeted us within seconds, even with the bar being very busy. We got drinks which were strong yet tasty.   The menu was bar food done well. We had the prime rib sandwich and the blackened BBQ wings. Both were excellent. We were checked on often, and it felt special as the owners came over and added that personal touch.   We had a speaker on the table and soon realized the we could get the sound from any tv in the place by a touch of a button. We watch our local Blackhawks, even though it was an out of market game.   Great people own and work at this bar  Glad we came and supported this local gem."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time recently. I like the place! I'll get right to it,the Blackened Wings are great ! Maybe the best wings I've had in Nevada! Like the setup with TVs all over,also like the idea of a Make your own Bloody Mary area except,you gotta have Worcestershire Sauce and Horseradish ! They were out! No Bueno my friends! Also had a Pizza and it was the low light of the experience , almost zero sauce and bland. I'll return,but stick with the wings!"}
{"text":"WOW, as soon as I walked in I was pleasantly surprised. It was so welcoming and everyone was very friendly, felt like I was back home at my neighborhood bar.  The food was great and service with a smile. I really felt welcome and will definately make Hammer's one of my favorite places to relax and unwind."}
{"text":"We had some take out food from this restaurant for lunch, and what a pleasant surprise! The food was excellent and the service was friendly. While the menu is some what limited to sandwiches and burgers, the food is delicious. If you are super hungry, order the fried pork sandwich; it's HUGE and delicious! The fries and the Fish & Chips are great too. What I liked is that the fried food was not greasy at all, and did not have the 'rancid oil' smell that many places have. Overall a great value!"}
{"text":"Went for their two for Tuesday, 2 dogs for $2, it was great!  2 Beers for the price of 1, that was great! But, there is no happy hour on any other day for drinks!  I am looking forward to trying their wings, but they MUST get a happy hour going.  I have told lots of others about it and everyone asks about happy hour. COME ON HAMMERS, GET A HAPPY HOUR GOING SOON!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere . We had fried mushrooms and pizza. Have had many of the menu items and all have been great !  It's nice when the owner asks you how everything was. He truly cares about taking care of his customers."}
{"text":"Best dang bar in Henderson. Love this place. Great people, great karaoke, and kick ass food. If you're new to the area or bored on a weekend night and need a place to go, this IS the spot. Always a good time..."}
{"text":"Oh Hammers!! My boyfriend and I have been to Hammers a few times and have had so so service but pretty good food. So when my boyfriends parents suggested it for an early Saturday dinner we agreed. We showed up a little before 6pm and ordered 2 beers. When the waitress arrived with our drinks, we let her know that 2 or maybe 3 more would be joining us. She then asked if we wanted to wait to order our food, which of course we did since we had just arrived and we're waiting for more. She then informed us that shift change was at 6pm and asked if we wanted to close out with her or transfer our bill. We had only ordered 2 drinks and been there 5 minutes so we told her just to transfer it. While, of course, we understand that she wanted a tip for the 5 minutes of service and beer; it seemed a little pushy. I then saw her immediate bolt over to a corner of some other customers and assuming, by the sudden stares and dirty looks, was talking about us.  Around 6:15pm, Our other guest arrived and she ended up taking our food order too. When her replacement waitress finally showed up, low and behold she couldn't transfer the tab! She didn't asked again, at which point we would have probably cashed out with her but instead said \"the computer, for some reason\" wouldn't let her. Coincidence?  Too bad because the food is good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere if it's your first time or your a regular the bar tenders are always friendly and are received as if they have known you forever,now someone is thinking that's there job well your right but show up here and you'll understand what I'm talking about. Kinda like the bar Cheers"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend I was in town visiting. We went for dinner and drinks on a Friday about 8pm. It's a small local bar in a strip mall.   Food was good. I ordered the BLT wrap minus the bacon. I was going to sub chicken but our server said I could have chicken or shrimp. Anytime I can get something with shrimp, I'm happy. I ordered coleslaw with it. It was delicious. Lots of shrimp. The coleslaw was tasty.   Service was good. Our server was nice. Quick to take our order and check for refills.  The best part of the evening was a father and son band that played. They were great. Made the evening even more enjoyable!  Great local bar. Good food and drinks. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"What a great bar and grill! Its everything I imagine a bar to be to be from the savory and fulfilling wings, fries, and burgers. To decked out sports memorabilia, tv, and fully stocked bar! You really get a sense of a hometown feel here. Real classic.  I came here for lunch, so I can't comment on the night time entertainment. But the food on the other hand was awesome! The meatball sandwhich I had was stuffed with two huge meatballs! They were the size of my fist! The burger my co-worker got was very big as well and the additional toppings were plentiful. The portions were huge and we left satisfied and with the biggeat case of a food coma lol."}
{"text":"Visited on a busy Friday lunch hour and entered to find a single waitperson/bartender, Keesa, working the 30 or so house.  We were not disappointed with the ratio as she was able to handle the patrons with appropriateness and professionalism.  She was able to handle the food and drinks with practiced organization.  The food was good, the atmosphere local and sports oriented but the service was exceptional.  I asked Keesa if she was an owner.  She said no, why didi I ask.  I told her it was because she worked like an owner should.  Can't go wrong in this establishment."}
{"text":"First time I walked into Hammer's I was immediately greeted with a warm reception.  Wanting to watch the Oregon vs Oregon State game, they attempted to accommodate me with one of the many TV's in the place.  I have driven by HMG&B many times.  Unless your looking or live in the immediate area you could miss it.   The set up for watching games is great.  There is the bar and behind that you have a \"bar top\" that faces the TV's, behind that is the dining area.  The queso sticks are unique.  The chicken fingers...fresh.  Both Awesome!  I was told that Bob Fleming, a former NHL player owns the joint.  He directed me to Youtube to find an outstanding hockey fight the Mr. Fleming was involved in when he played the with the Buffalo Sabers.  I got to watch football, eat great chow, watch football, watch a hockey fight all the while drinking ice cold beer.....AWESOME!   This is a \"local\" bar.  From what I have noticed in my visits is there is a smoking area outside but some of the \"regulars\" some inside.  Be prepared for this and remember you are after all in a bar."}
{"text":"Although the food is good and I am all about supporting a local business, I just can't deal with the smoke and spotty service. Even the dining area reeks of smoke. I had to take a shower after I got done eating there because the smell was just  too much. Also, our waitress who I assume is also the owner at first was attentive and then kinda forgot about us to go BS with the bar patrons and watch the game. Boyfriend's mom went without her ice tea refilled for a very long time. Server/owner also took forever to bring over the check. I could understand it if she was slammed, but not when I can see her standing at the bar watching the game. I gave this place a chance, but left with a completely different impression this time. Pass"}
{"text":"went to hammers and bought a wide guy burger, FAR AND AWAY the greatest burger EVER created. loved the atmosphere, tons of t.v.'s for sports, and my server whitney was awesome, very sweet and took great care of me !!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever greasy food employees drinking!! Stay away!! Waited 40 minutes for food dirty silverware and cups just not good at all!!! Stay away!"}
{"text":"Hello Hendertucky! This place is a total dive. And the patrons are, well, interesting. They have karaoke. Combine all of that and you've got one horribly awesome place. They serve food. The drinks are cheap. There are tables and a bar. There's no separation between the bar and dining area. You can smoke at the bar, but not at a table. It's so terrible, it's awesome. We had a total blast here."}
{"text":"Place was packed , people seemed to enjoy themselves, but the kitchen was so dirty I'm surprised there selling food out of here ! I seen dirty greasy towels and old food all on the floor I couldn't believe my eyes it was so bad ! Bar experience seemed clean and fun but I will never eat there again !!!"}
{"text":"We love going to hammers. Every bar tender we have had, has always been super friendly and given great service. The food has always been great as well, huge burgers, good fries, and the fried pork loin sandwich is to die for!! At one time they had deep fried fettuccine alfredo that my daughter and I always ordered but the last time we were in hammers, it wasn't on the menu, so that bummed us out. On Saturdays they have BBQ ribs, and me being a huge BBQ nut, I had to try them. Well, lets just say I wont be getting the \"BBQ\" ribs again any time soon. the ribs are the only thing on the menu we have not enjoyed. All in all, hammers has loyal customers with us."}
{"text":"Had a party melt today. It was ok. Still the best fresh fries around!! Add gravy on them and mmmmmmm!!!"}
{"text":"The drunken clams are only OK you get a lot but hardly any meat in them lots of sauce and a couple slices of their garlic bread ... again they were only OK , Great atmosphere fun place."}
{"text":"We came to check out the specials, different than was on the yelp site.  Waiter was excellent and will look into updating the site. We tried the fish & chips,  four pieces and fresh made fries.  Will be back Friday for the fish & chips special."}
{"text":"Great bartenders, great priced drinks and the best karoake DJ on Thursdays known to man."}
{"text":"Was here for 7 hours on a Sunday for football, including gambling for 5 hours straight. Did not receive a single discount or thank you for being a loyal all day customer (no one except the bartender stayed longer than we did; we have also been consistent return customers for the last 3 months). Extremely disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"Terrible service..got our beer and sat forever before we could even order..ordered an appitizer and it sat in the window for 10 minutes and then we told the waitress(who was serving shots at the bar) we were leaving and she could have cared less."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here the other day because I have been looking for any place that makes a pork tenderloin sandwich. The sandwich was absolutely fantastic but you better be hungry because it is BIG. When I got to the restaurant I actually found out that this restaurant was owned by the same guy that had a restaurant in Bartonville, Illinois. I had eaten a tenderloin sandwich at that place years ago and it was great there as well. If you are from the Midwest and want a great tenderloin this is the only place I have found that has them. This is like every Midwest bar and grill I have ever been in and has great food and a friendly environment with great people. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"When we moved to Henderson we asked neighbors to recommend a  restaurant for fish. Hammer's was named. Service was poor. It took 30 min. To get two beers and then another 30 min. To take our order. The order came out fairly quick. The fish was on the menu as all you can eat. 45 minutes later one small piece of fish arrived. We left a fair tip and left. The waitress told us she was sorry and said she would buy us a drink. We left. Two weeks later we tried again with a similar experience. Only there was a drunk girl trying to give orders to the staff while some people  a quote for a future party. She kept changing the prices and leavening them alone while yelling in the kitchen. My rule has always been to give a place a second chance. They have had theirs."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and great food! Everyone is kind and friendly. Live music and karaoke and jukebox. It's worth going depending on your mood to get out and have fun. Awesome food specials \"fried mushrooms\" are my addiction."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to have lunch! Pork tenderloin sandwich and the meatball are to die for. Fries are always fresh cut and very tender. Owner and staff very friendly! Thanks for having such a great place to hang out at!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Henderson/Vegas. Great, attentive bartenders. You'll always feel welcome and at home. Order the fried pickles!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, had to wait too long for our food. It was a Sunday and there were very few ppl in the bar."}
{"text":"I'm going to give two stars because, honestly, the fried pickles were fantastic.   Unfortunately, I witnessed something that left a really bad taste in my mouth.  Last night  I came in with my husband to have some food and watch football. We decided to eat and leave though because of the atmosphere. There was an employee there drinking, and she had 4 young children with her. The employee was very obviously drunk, and then left to drive home, with her children in the car. Our server even warned us that it had started raining and that the weather was getting bad, but apparently was okay with a coworker driving drunk in the bad weather. I've been sick about it ever since. Over-serving is dangerous by itself, but to let your employee leave and drive drunk with 4 children is deplorable."}
{"text":"Great food, Love the drunken clams! They have awesome daily specials and the best prime rib sandwich ever! But whats even better is that it is consistant. Very friendly and fun staff."}
{"text":"These guys make the BEST burgers!!!!!! I get mine with mushrooms, American cheese, avocado, and bacon! Tell them to make your fries crispy and get a side of ranch dressing for dipping!!! Their burgers are big and juicy and oh-so-good!!!! Great place for lunch or dinner - this is definitely a neighborhood Joint!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to watch the game, food like you wouldn't believe!! Try the Bloody Mary bar, everything you could ever ask for!! This place has a home town feeling, and everyone says hi when you walk through the door!!"}
{"text":"First off the owner of the business is a sweetheart. The staff is really nice and the food great!!! I had the buffalo chicken fingers with fries, we had the fried pickles as appetizer, chocolate molten cake desert and the BF had the canal street. Although everything was great I fell in love with the fried pickles.   The place is decorated with sports memorabilia and tv's playing sports are everywhere. They have live entertainment on weekend and a karaoke night. This is definitely on my repeat list and will bring lots of friends to boot!!! :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Came from Placerville, CA for a rugby event down the street. Googled great lunch and ended here. The service and the food was so great that we came back the next day. This place is on our map the next time we are this direction."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar! Always something going on there. I love the karaoke on Thursday nights. The prices are good and I have never had trouble being comped drinks while playing. The food is average bar food except for Tuesday taco night those things are amazing! If you want a place to hangout and watch the game you won't be disappointed with Hammers!"}
{"text":"I received a 2 for one coupon in a mailer for 7 time championship wings.  How could I pass it up?  My wife and I entered the bar and the first thing we noticed was how smoky it was inside.  After waiting 5 minutes by the door, I finally asked the waitress if we could get a table.  She led us to a table where she quickly took our drink order and we had them in no time.  We pondered over the menu, I had the choice of medium, hot or insane.  I decided to go for the hot wings because I like a little bite on my wings. One thing I noticed is they had plenty of flat screen TV's through out the dining area.  After waiting for 15 minutes she finally came back to get our order.  I was frustrated with her at first until I noticed that she was the only waitress.  She was working at least 10 tables and at least another 15-20 people sitting at a divider.  It was not her fault, management should have anticipated a larger crowd with scheduled entertainment.  They had a band playing that night which was pretty good.  They played Country music, old and new styles.  The band consisted of 3 men with a combined age of around 190 years.  Once we did get our order in it took very little time to get the food.  The order I got had 9 wings and it came with blue cheese, carrots and celery. ( 2 half sticks of each)   My wife had the tenders, it came with 4 tenders and a large amount of French fries.  Each had a price of $8.75.   My wings arrived piping hot, the flavor didn't jump right out at me nor did the heat from the sauce.  Sometimes it takes a few seconds to feel, if you have had hot wings, you know what I mean.  It never came, neither ever came, flavor or heat. It tasted like there was salt and pepper with maybe some paprika on them. The only burn I got was the a burn in my nose from the cigarette smoke in the air, which was coming from people at a 3 foot high divider/bar smoking literally a few feet from our table.  I don't know what championship they won, the flavor of the ones I ate weren't worthy of any award..  My wife's tenders had the regular bar medium sauce on them.  Even this was better than mine.  This was a disappointment.  I don't know how many times I thought to myself, \"We should have went to Johnny Mac's.\"  I am just glad I got it at buy one get one free.  Kind of like the feeling of watching a red box movie and you think \"I'm glad didn't pay full price at the theater for this\".  To sum it up, if you don't mind waiting for service, for average food, in a smoke filled room, this place might be for you."}
{"text":"This place is a total dump. The trashy loud-mouthed bar staff keeps the bar full of creepy old men. This is the bar when you walk in all the old guys turn and stare at your girlfriend for 20 minutes straight. The crowd gets pretty ghetto in here at night too. Don't eat anything."}
{"text":"blt wrap. yes! breakfast burrito, even better.   love the bartenders.   always feels like home."}
{"text":"Tonight I didn't want to cook, so I downloaded UberEats. There were limited options available and I choose this place.  I preferred nachos,  fries and wings.  Nachos were sub par, salty and cold. Wings were flavorless and oily. The fries were just inedible. See pic. How can you screw up fries? They were brown.  They sent me brown fries."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if possible. Where to begin? A waitress who died and came back to life miraculously.....as regulars we were all genuinely in mourning, when is service, where to send flowers, etc. Turns out she was in jail.... And this seemed to be a great cover story. Very inappropriate shenanigans going on among staff....sexual favors, God knows what else, etc.  Owners drunk barfly wife calls a black friend of ours \"house bigger.\" I changed the first letter....I kid you not!  What is more disturbing is that she was so drunk she mistook our friend for a different patron who it was apparently OK to say that to.... Owners son is a punk fight starter.  Just about every regular who kept the pkace in business its first few years has been 86'd including a regular band that played there...lol. Dysfunctional.  Sometimes you can't take the former hockey player out of the gutter.  Oh, but the food is pretty decent!"}
{"text":"We came here after leaving another local sports bar at halftime due to the obnoxious clientele at the time. This was a nice change. Super friendly staff and great service. Can't vouch for the food since we only came here for football and beer, but they had good deals on drinks during the games! We came here to catch the Chargers game, and although it wasn't on the main screen (with volume), the server gave us a box with adjustable volume that we could sit on our tabletop and listen to the Chargers game while we watched! Awesome! I wish more bars would do this! Knocking off one star for the smokey atmosphere. C'mon guys, it's 2014. No one wants to breathe that anymore."}
{"text":"Not really sure how this place is getting good reviews. The food is pretty good, I will admit that, but the service and being comped drinks is very poor. I have gone there twice, and both times played $20 at the bar and haven't gotten free drinks. I was told because I wasn't playing max bets, which would be $1.25 per hand.... Three hands would be a drink, so really why would you play and not just pay for drinks? Most locals are looking for a cool place to hang out and have drinks with friends. Most places comp if just have $20 in a machine. Hammers is not like most places and as a local, I will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"So I came here to grab a drink while waiting for my haircut appointment next door. The staff and crowd were very friendly and I would definitely come back and stay for a little bit longer!"}
{"text":"This place has the best food and super friendly service! The owner is invested in making this place as close to Cheers as it gets. The portions of food are always big and made with love. If you're looking for great food and a friendly environment try Hammers. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Karaoke Night! Are great! The DJ Johnnie Cash is one of the best and fairest Karaoke DJs that I know. He really knows how to run a proper rotation. The people that work here are great and friendly and after a couple of times here you feel like a personal friend. I couldn't say enough good things about this place. It does get so busy at times that you have to go up to the bar to get a drink but I don't mind at all."}
{"text":"One of the best hangouts in town. Friendly staff, cold beer, good food, awesome karaoke! Big screens all around to watch your favorite team. I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Great service! Great people! Amazing band! Just moved to Henderson and we have found our local hangout!!"}
{"text":"Great place to meet your friends.  Local live music on Fridays.  Great daily specials"}
{"text":"If I was rating this place on food alone I swear it would be a 5 easy the food is more than amazing. The pork tenderloin sandwich was out of this world huge portions and a great price. But here is the thing its still a typical dive bar with sleazy drunks eyeing your girl and grabbing at the bartender/waitress. Smoke all over the place and it is supposed to be a \"hockey\" bar but let's be honest it really isn't had to practically beg to get the Bruins game on while two different tvs had the exact same Nascar channel on. But the waitress was super nice and the food is well worth a try."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on one lunch time visit. I went for lunch based on a friend's recommendation.  Walking in the door by myself I was immediately comfortable. It was well lit, only a handful of customers at the time and NO SMOKE! A definite plus in my book having given up smoking 10 months ago! I don't know if they ever allow smoking since the bar and the dining area are basically one, but it was smoke free while I was there and I was THRILLED! They didn't offer  lunch special, but I opted to try the burger since that is generally safe anywhere I go. The burger was only slightly undercooked for my taste, but it was good. It came fully loaded, evn though I asked for no tomato. No biggy, I'm an easy going kinda gal and I just plopped the tomatoes outta there! The burger was $6 and came with a side of fries. Cheese is an extra 50 cents...I had my fries German style (mayo on the side). They were slightly crispy, but I like them that way and they had just the right amount of salt. Now the iced tea I had (since I have also given up soda...) was not to my liking. I don't know if they make it themselves or its bottled but the flavor was off, like maybe Henderson has really bad water or something. I don't line there so I don't know for sure if that's how the water tastes, but I didn't care for it. I'm not sure why but when my check came the iced tea was not on it....maybe they knew it was bad. LOL!  The waiter/bartender was very attentive, easily made the rounds from bar to tables and waited on everyone quite well without rushing. A group of gentlemen came in, apparently for a prearranged meeting and they were immediately set up with tables moved, menus all around and even a bit of cajoling....seemed like they were happy to be there. Even without a special, the price was right, the food is decent and the atmosphere is enjoyable. I look forward to a return visit during a happy hour or a sporting event, as I hear it a great time there!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday night to checkout this place. Here's the abridged version: Great Blackened Wings..... $20 lasted an hour on their bar poker.....

Drinks were well poured ( not weak and not to strong )  ALL IN ALL A GOOD TIME WITH UNUSUAL MEMORIES, lol"}
{"text":"If it look like a bar, smells like a bar, it's a BAR. Cool classic Midwest bar look with a great pork tenderloin sandwich. It's a total local joint...."}
{"text":"Always have fun at hammers. Keesa is the best ! Wings there are always great they are even half priced on Thursday's . Believe their meatballs are homemade make a pretty good sub . They always seem to try to have something going on bands, specials, karaoke, and promotions. Also love julie !"}
{"text":"I love Hammers, the food and service are awesome!  We go there at least once a week and its always fun, friendly and consistent. The prices are reasonable too.  We love all the servers there, def a great local bar and restaurant.  If you love mushrooms, get the fried mushrooms, and the wings are THE BEST in town!  They grill them after they fry them so it gives them extra flavor and crunch.  I always get the patty melt and add jalapenos to it, its to die for.  The blue cheese wedge is my fav salad there too. You really can't go wrong with anything but those are my favorites.."}
{"text":"Hammers in Henderson is awesome because Mike and Whitney work here. There are a lot of Bars in Henderson / Las Vegas area but the staff here is friendly and fun. The food is excellent. The parking lot has space to park your car. They had live music. They had a million televisions minus 999,990. A lot of sports stuff. Good spot!"}
{"text":"Average bar. Food not so good. A lot of regulars has potential. Maybe management needs an overhaul. Lol. Would possibly return only for the lack of decent places in the area."}
{"text":"Came in for a greasy burger and was disappointed.  I got the Patty Melt and it was fantastic and the fries were great.  A lot of bar food is greasy but not here.  Ample portions and COLD beer.  Great food, great prices."}
{"text":"Walked in with my wife to grab a quick drink and a bite too eat. We sat down at the bar and started looking at the food being served looked really greasy and brown. We still thought we would give it a chance but the service was terrible so we just ended up walking out. We will never go back there again."}
{"text":"If you're looking to watch a hockey game... You'll most likely find it here. Lots of TVs with lots of games playing! Video poker, keno, etc at the bar, which is also fun. They have daily food specials & reasonably priced drinks. Service was awesome & so were the owners. Only thing stopping a 5 star rating in my eyes was the smoke.. Had to change my clothes as soon as we left the bar. (But no one else seemed to mind it). Overall a pretty great local bar :)"}
{"text":"While in Henderson for my daughters soccer practice we decided to stop by and grab a bite. As soon as we walked in everyone was so welcoming and nice. Food was very tasty and good portions. Everyone loved what they ordered would definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been back now a couple of times and have to say this place rocks for being local.great service and pretty descent food. Hard drinks could stand to be poured a little better.. But I don't mind ordering beer so it's all good. Lots of TVs for viewing at every angle. The crowd tends to be in their 40s I would say which is older than what I go for. But when I want some quick wings and a beer it rocks. Also, omg get the fries with with ranch"}
{"text":"Best bar in Henderson. Great food, friendly service. Wide Guy Karaoke with DJ Livin' LARGE on Saturday is great some really talented people show up so if your not a singer you will be entertained. Lots of free give-a-ways. Most amount of fun you can have with your clothes on..."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon this place one day when looking for a new bar close to home that played the Green Bay Packers game.  We had a few important things on our list:  Good food, lots of TVs for the game and cheap beer.  Is that too much to ask?! LOL.  Hammer's Grill and Bar is located close to Horizon and College Dr in a small strip mall.  The inside is really cool.  For such a small bar, this place is PACKED with TVs.  EVERYWHERE.  They also have sound boxes which I LOVE about it.  That way, all the games can be on the TV and you won't miss the sound at all.    Now let's talk about the bartender, Reid.  He is probably the coolest guy and best bartender I've met in a long time!  He's super cool, chill and on top of his game.  Just don't touch anyone else's slot machine, even if they're your best friend.  He will scold you LOL.  It's all in fun.    Their food is actually really good.  Heck, I love it!  Both times I've been there, I've gotten the chicken nachos for $10.  It was a HUGE platter, filled with tortilla chips, shredded chicken, jalapenos, cheese, garlic salsa and sour cream.  These nachos were bomb.com and so huge!  If you live in the Henderson area, you need to check out Reid and the rest of the gang here at Hammer's.  He really remembers your name!  It's like Cheers!"}
{"text":"Place doesn't look like much on the outside but we had a very good meal there.  The tomato basil soup was outstanding and we also had the chicken quesadilla was great too.  It's a bar in Las Vegas so there people smoking so you should probably expect that.  The decor is of an old bar.  But the food was good and the server was nice."}
{"text":"I don't drink so this is for food and service only.  The food is pretty good. I love their salad and the soup is homemade and well worth mentioning. Our favorite thing on the menu is the meatball sandwich. The meatballs are excellent. The portions are pretty generous and the service is fine. There is a good cook here, not someone out back using a micorwave like some places.  Just a note it's loud and very sports themed, which is fine if it's your thing. I don't come here often because of the noise or choice of music but that's just me I get nervous ( Think I am getting old..).  The owner is super nice and almost always there. If you want to hang out locally and like good food this place is worth a shot. You can eat healthy here, the salads are well done... but beware you get tons of tempting fries with sandwich orders.. Stingy they are not...  :)"}
{"text":"This is now one of our favorite places, if not the favorite place to eat.  Its bar food but its all homemade.  The service is always great and prompt. Never one issue with anything. Homemade fries, onion rings and most everything I think. Wings are awesome. Onion are crisp and really good. My wife and my FIL have both ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich. WOWOW. Lots of food and great food too.  Burgers, pizza and the build your own chicken sandwich are awesome. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been to this bar several times but have not been there recently.Today I ate a Meatball sandwich, and you can definitely tell that the food is prepared fresh and not from canned goods. This sandwich is highly recommended by me. The atmosphere and the service are also excellent!"}
{"text":"This is a great bat to watch any game.  Lots of TV's and the menu was good.  But a few disappointing things were the amount of smoke.  The ventilation is very bad, and this was the first Vegas bar that I've ever been to that closed at 2 am.  Another let down.  So all in all, good atmosphere, great games playing.  But too smokey and they close early!  So be prepared!"}
{"text":"Found this place after searching for bars to watch NHL games around Vegas.  Awesome motzy sticks with ranch and marinara sauce.  Not a big fried pickle fan but we decided to do the special with fried pickles and pizza. It was worth it. Pizza took awhile but there was no rush so no big deal. Food was good overall. Very smoky in there which i hate     Seemed as if everyone was chain smokers.   Owner of the bar was cool he introduced himself to us. Fought stu grimson from the Blackhawks back in the day   . Would give another star if the smoke wasnt an issue :("}
{"text":"Looked for a good place to eat and watch football game before flight back to Chicago. Yelp popped this GREAT place on our radar. Had a wing special and they were delicious. Hubby had a ginormous pork tenderloin which he enjoyed and i had a great burger. Fries were yummy, too. Excellent service and awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"\"Monstrous Portion\" was what the menu said about the prime rib beef dip sandwich.  The sandwich was NOT but the price WAS. Meat to bun ratio was 25% meat to 75% bread and the meat was fatty. Generally speaking it was overpriced. My chicken sandwich was tasty with fresh mushrooms sauteed & swiss cheese,  bread nicely toasted but again skimpy meat to bread. Our server was friendly and attentive. Her recommendation for the wings blackened was excellent and we enjoyed them. I didn't appreciate the idea that karaoke started before the baseball game ended and informed the server we'd need our bill before singing started. We didn't get an itemized receipt and left feeling ripped off. Our bad for not requesting the itemized receipt but this place doesn't live up to it's own hype. 2.5 stars because the wings were very good, it was clean and our service was good."}
{"text":"So glad Hammer's is making it in this location.  We only have PTs out here and I can't stand them and their service is always slow.  The decor is a man's dream - all sports themed.  There are hats on various teams, hockey jerseys and fun stuff on teams.  I love the decor and find the place to be cool by just the way it looks.  You have typically one waiter or waitress that is realy laid back and always remembers to refill drinks and brings the bill right away.  Now for the food - AWESOME!  I got a marinated chicken sandwhich with fresh avocados and bacon - so good.  My husband got the burger with fries and he loved it as well.  The fries had a good flavor and were very crunchy.  Having an hour lunch I was back to the office in that time frame do to the speedy service.  I would go again.  We have gone 4 times but I forgot to write reviews.  Same experience each time - EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"If I could give this establishment a negative two I would.... my friends and I enjoy Kareoke alot and after I got carded in a bar and grill that we usually go to we called this establishment and asked if they had an age requirement for their Kareoke. When I first walked in the waiter asked if I wanted anything to drink and asked me for my ID. At which point I said \"\"I am underage and therefore will not be drinking. I am here to sing and to be the designated driver for all my friends who are 21+\". He said ok and left us alone. 10pm rolls around and he approaches me again (just after I put in my request with the KJ) and told me because I was underage I had to leave. I said \"I dont understand, I called and asked if there was an age requirement and the person on the phone said no\" he continued to insist I leave. When we stood in the parking lot to figure out what to do next and the bar manager came out screaming and swearing and claiming that I attempted to purchase alcohol and that the police were on their way. I WILL NOT be returning..not even when I do turn 21. These people need to learn to give customers the right information and a correct level of respect.. cuz not once did we scream and swear at anyone in there."}
{"text":"Really good bar food. Great daily specials. The fried pickles and mushrooms are primo."}
{"text":"I cannot remember what this place was called before, but I used to frequent almost every weekend with friends. There was an awesome bartender named Janie here that created her own shot, and she allowed me and my friends to name it. We called it, \"Janie's Got a Shot\". Get it? lol!  Anyway, now it is Hammer's. I allowed the same friends to bring me here for karaoke night and it is still cosmetically the same, but atmospherically different. Just not my cup of tea (or shot, if you will). There's fun to be had here, don't get me wrong. I am probably just comparing it to what it used to be. My friends still love this place and visit almost every Saturday for karaoke night. Me? I think I will pass and just remember the good ol days."}
{"text":"I had bookmarked to try this bar but rarely am around this location.  I just happened to see it while riding my motorcycle today and stopped in for a couple beers.  I wound up playing some video poker and watched the UNLV game.  The bartender and Hammer seemed like nice people.  Hammer is a Bears fan so I will be back to watch some football when season starts."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Hammer's?! Weird.  Anyhow, this is the bar closest to my house - I can literally walk here (and do quite often).  I like that it is a locally owned, non-chain and is so close by.  Convenience is the key here.  It's not a large place, and they've been talking about expanding for what seems like forever now, but it hasn't happened.  There is a large bar on the left side of the place, with dining room seating on the larger portion of the place.  I've never had any of their food, so I can't really comment on the table service or quality.  Everytime I go in, I usually stick $20 in the machine and play some video poker.  I've never had a problem getting comp drinks - maybe because I am in there enough, or because I am a girl?  The beer selection is really nothing to write home about, they have the usual suspects (Bud Light, Coors, Miller, etc).  There may be some Guinness or New Castle available, and the last time I was there they had Lagunitas IPA, which was a surprising treat.  I stopped going in for awhile because an ex-boyfriend got a job bartending there, but since he has moved on, it's fair game again!  They seem to have a high turnover of bartenders, which may have to do with the crowd or the location.  It really is a locals place - I can't see anyone going out of their way to go there.  There is sports memorabilia everywhere, which is cool.  There are also quite a few tvs, so it is a decent place to catch a game.  It can get smoky, but it is a bar afterall!  I am not a smoker, but I understand why they allow people to smoke at the bar....  I will be back, if nothing but for the convenience of the place.  There aren't many bars that you can (safely) walk to and stumble home from!  I wish that they would expand their patio (if that's what you want to call it), so I could stop there when walking my dog."}
{"text":"My major complaint is that this place is SO SMOKEY! Service its pretty slow, so don't be in a hurry. Love their blacken wings! Come get them half of on Thursdays. Big portions for a decent price."}
{"text":"Staff doesn't know what the they're doing. It's cheap but you get what you pay for. Don't waste your time there's a PT is one block away."}
