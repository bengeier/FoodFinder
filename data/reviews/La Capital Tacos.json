{"text":"OMG, really great sign when the flavour you expected to be, is there!  Ribeye Tacos perfect 10/10, likewise for the carnitas ones.  The only downside is that is freezing inside."}
{"text":"Awesome joint in Chinatown Montreal, of all places. Extremely friendly and willing staff that takes care of you. Food is outstanding!  We had the ribeye tacos, the carnitas tacos, and the battered shrimp tacos, along with a pulled pork quesadilla to share. Find this great little spot and enjoy."}
{"text":"I wasn't hungry so we just ordered the steak tacos. But I loved it so much and had to add the pork one. That's how yummy those tacos are. As good as the ones we tasted down in Texas. We were plenty surprised since Montreal is not exactly known for mex food and this place is in Chinatown! Funny that I was craving for dumpling that time and ended up filled by tacos! Highly recommend a visit to Chinatown!"}
{"text":"I love having tacos in Chinatown ! Really chill not a big production type of place and the food is delicious and priced really well. I am giving it only 4 stars because the shrimp has a little too much batter for what it is but the rest is good"}
{"text":"The shrimp tacos are amazing. I don't know if they are on the menu but I sampled some of a hottest/spiciest sauces i've ever had. small menu, but there's options for every one. Great snack place if you need a quick bite and a good Mezcal.  Open late on the weekends which is often a life saver when I get off work at 10-11pm!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very nice mexican traditional tacos. You have to try the gringas and piratas. People is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Bland. Dirty glasses. No chicken tacos. Cramped- practically sit on a stranger's lap. Small portions. The tempeh comes with just one piece of canned pineapple. Music is good."}
{"text":"One of the best taco places in Montreal. Space is cozy, staff is very friendly and food delicious. The shrimp tacos are the best."}
{"text":"Very good tacos, pleasant atmosphere.  Went 2 times over the weekend, and both times they were out of the daily special despite it being early evening.  Long lines, but the staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to trying the food at La Capital Tacos based on the rave reviews on Yelp!  Sadly, when my family visited our food was just average and the price was outrageous.  This was definitely our most expensive meal and the food was just okay.  I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"Très bon mais vraiment pas assez de choix de nourriture genre 5 tacos différent et portions trop petites pour le prix !! 3 minuscule tacos pour 10$, on a fini au mcdo .."}
{"text":"This place was OK, if I could give it 3.5 stars I would. They could really use a host or an extra waiter/bartender (shared responsibilities). When you walk in, there is a sign that says to wait at the door to be seated. I waited for 10 minutes without acknowledgement and walked further into the restaurant, where I waited a little while longer. The restaurant was full with a very limited amount of empty seats. When finally seated the service was good but the staff was clearly very busy so can't blame them for not being overly attentive, this review is geared more towards management. I ordered a margarita, guacamole and tempeh tacos. Margarita was good and freshly made. Guacamole was average for a Mexican joint, the chips it was served with were thick and crunchy. The tacos were good. The texture of the tempeh was surprising. Usually tempeh resembles meat very well, but this had the same consistency as potatoes. In any case, it was tasty, served with an avocado sauce and pineapple. The ingredients were fresh. The food didn't blow me away and the staff was overworked, overall average experience."}
{"text":"Shrimp taco a bit heavy but delicious, steak taco is amazing and the guacamole is very authentic and delicious Great service definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Considering there aren't many options for tacos in Montreal I would say La Capitale is definitely a good one. Central, reasonably priced, well prepared food and with a good vibe! Everything you need to be happy. From the Guacamole, to the refried beans, to the beef, shrimp & pork tacos, I wasn't disappointed. Check out my full review here for more details http://delifeed.ca/2016/03/03/la-capitale-or-how-to-eat-tacos-in-chinatown/"}
{"text":"Super tasty tacos! Fun easy-going atmosphere. Like a dive bar meets mexican taco shop meets China town. Super affordable and delicious :)"}
{"text":"I went there with 4 other coworkers on a friday for lunch. We got there around noon and the place was almost full. We managed to get a table near the cashier in the back.  The menu looked quite simple as there were not many choices. I've heard good comments about the tacos, but I chose to order 2 quesadillas (i'm a cheese lover): gringa & pirata.  It took more than 30 minutes to get all our orders. For that kind of wait, I had high expectations for our tacos and quesadillas. You know, if it take that long to make such simple dishes, it must be something fancy or at least a big plate. But what we got blew my mind away. It was ... plain and simple...and i had something that looked like a small tortilla folded on pulled beef with nothing else... i could barely see any cheese coming out of it...  The taste was good but not worth all the wait. Besides, the place is really noisy and the ventation was bad; you could see the smoke around the table and the smell sticks to your clothes. Beware if you are seated near the entrance, you better keep your coat on! I was sitting on the nack and could feel a chilly breeze.  Overall, the taste of the tacos/quesadillas is good, but I will never go there again for lunch time. The service was very average. While the waiter was cleaning our table, he dropped some sauce on my coworker and seemed very lunatic. Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"The first impression was that the space is cozy and clean, and we were immediately received before we even stepped in. The staff was very attentive and friendly and the tacos were absolutely delicious and high quality. Mexican cokes are a favourite as usual!"}
{"text":"Le capital tacos est M-A-L-A-D-E!!! Pour avoir mangé dans plusieurs ville mexicaine dans des petit resto délicieux, le capitol tacos a mis le mexique dans mon assiette.  Je recommande vraiment pour de la vrai bonne bouffe Mexicaine!  Enfin du real Mexicanito!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. The bartender/ likely the owner was incredibly personable and engaging. A great meal for anyone who is hungry in the area!"}
{"text":"We were on a trip and had to have dinner in Montreal. We went in randomly and really didn't know what to expect. The food was really good, we ordered quasadeiia and it was the best one I've ever eaten. Of course, the portions were small and the prices were high(at least compared to Toronto). But the quality was so good, and the beef was soooo delicious that it was totally worth it. we left there really happy. I would definitely recommend this place to any mexican food lover. BTW, their hot sauce was really good and the waiters and waitresses were really good and considerate."}
{"text":"A good go-to place for tacos in Montreal. Try the fried shrimp tacos. Really hits the spot."}
{"text":"This is the best taco / Mexican place I've ever been to (and I'm from Toronto). Every time we visit Montreal, we have to come to this place at least once. The shrimp tacos are amazing and the beef quesadilla is absolutely out of this world. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is really great! 2 stars; here's why!  Sadly service is very slow, went on a wednesday and waited 20-30mins to be seated. We waited because we really wanted to try it!  Tried to go for a second time (saturday) and a third time (sunday) but got denied. Waiter's words were \" we are under staffed so we are deying new clients right now \".   And so, you got to take a risk if you want to go, not knowing if you'll be able to get in or not.  Luckily for us, there are plenty more taco places in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Does Montreal have any good restaurants. Chinatown does it's LaCapital Tacos. I'm from Texas so I know about Mexican food. I almost passed it up because it is in Chinatown. OMG best guac and chips ever better than Texas restaurants. I will be here for another week and I will definitely go back before I leave. I wanted to take a picture of my dish but I stayed eating the guac and chips and are it all. I also ordered the Shrimp tacos I could barely finish it because the guac stole the show."}
{"text":"Tacos de premier choix qui nous rappel sans contredit les vendeurs de rue du Mexique. Pour le chips avec guacamole il était trop salée et nuisais à la qualité.  Venais de recevoir leur permis d'alcool ce qui leur permettra d'ajouté des bières mexicaine et drink. Donc pour aujourd'hui un 3.5* mais je suis sur que cela va allez en augmentant...."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this during hot summer day on visit friom nyc; gentle kind service nice salsa and carnitas recommended"}
{"text":"I live close by in the Old Port. I've passed by many times. This time, I decided, on an whim, to check it out. I'm a huge fan of Mexican cuisine and was curious about a small business (respect) that would have the smarts and gumption to open up in Chinatown. I ordered the Yucatan pulled pork with pickled radish tacos. My young son had the dessert.  The tacos were...fine. The temperature (a higher one) would have helped the taste of the meat. I wouldn't go with any of the desserts (which are unspecified and placed under the heading of \"upon request.\") Granted, I don't like desserts, but Mexican desserts are varied, fantastic, and worth offering properly. All this said: La Capital is certainly not a poor choice...but I do feel that I'm saying that by default. Montreal has few places (at least to my knowledge) that offer decent Mexican fare at least at a decent price point. The prices at La Capital are great, but I felt the freshness and overall quality of the ingredients would benefit from, maybe a 20% (?) increase in effort, care, and respect for Latin fare. The servers were lovely, as far as I could tell."}
{"text":"If there's one simple food everyone loves it is a taco. Starting a taco joint may seem easy, but it takes attention to detail to really perfect the taco. La Capital - in the middle of Montreal and, funnily enough, Chinatown - has chosen to pay attention to detail and is rewarded with some marvelous little tacos. The al pastor is TRUE al pastor, meaning it's cooked on a spit. As a Texan who lives in a jungle of mexican restaurants, finding one that cooks al pastor the true way is surprisingly difficult. It says a lot to put al pastor on your menu and then not cheat!!  The salsas were tasty, the juice of the day is very authentic to mexican cuisine, and the space is small but refined in that taco joint kind of way. No maître d, just some good food in a great city."}
{"text":"Great Tacos. Reasonable Prices.  In a time when tacos are counted among the ranks of hipster-revival food, it's nice to find a taco spot that can deliver on an above average taco (for Montreal, anyway) without any pretentiousness. In fact, the only thing that even closely ironic about this place is that it's in Chinatown.  The menu is limited, but sufficiently diverse that there's something (taco-like) for everyone without the choice being overwhelming. For a surefire meal, I'd recommend the shrimp tacos and the grilled beet salad."}
{"text":"Nice place! Great staff, good food! A bit uncomfortable table that we got aside the window but the rest was good, I would totally go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Super cute taco place in Chinatown! Who would've thought? I really liked their quesadillas which came in individual portions but that just means you get to sample multiple flavours! They had a great selection of tacos and other snack foods. I would skip the appetizers, they're on the small end and just get more variety of mains. I would also get a freshly squeezed coconut water if they're offering that! What a great dining experience!   The only downside is that because they are located quite close to several office buildings there is a huge lunch rush between 12 - 1 and so you might be uncomfortably squeezed next to two strangers. This could be avoided with more individual tables but otherwise amazing dining experience!"}
{"text":"finally a good authentic Mexican place ironically located in china town. fish tacos are the best. portions are a bit small for the price but so worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to this place for lunch and supper a couple of times. Really love the shrimp tacos and the grilled beef tacos! Also a fan of their guacamole, although the portion is quite small for the price. If you are ordering the tacos, you get 3 per plate and depending on what you order range from $10-$14 a plate. They also have some selection of beer and cocktails if you go there at night. And surprisingly enough they have mexican coca cola! Overall giving this place 4 stars because of the price in terms of portion size."}
{"text":"Great place in Chinatown.  A little difficult to find.  Once found, a great relaxed, cool atmosphere.  Some communal tables.  Little disappointed at their whisky selection, so ordered Coronas instead.  Authentic food, and the veggie tostadas were delicious"}
{"text":"Very good tacos!  Sauces are delicious. Portions can be bigger and free tortilla chips with a small salsa while you're waiting would've been great."}
{"text":"We walked by this place many times and stopped in for a bite.  The tacos were good however the shrimp tacos were waay too battered.  You couldn't make out the shape of the shrimp.  Car it's taco was full of meat and tasty.     I didn't like their house salsa, it had the consistency of pasta sauce.   The final straw was our guacamole came out slightly brown and......after eating half of it, a previous diner's chip was embedded in the salsa.  Soggy and all.   Gross.  Never coming back.   Don't recycle your food."}
{"text":"Wow - great taco's in Chinatown- go figure. Fresh lemonade with a shot of tequila set the mood. Fast service and great sauces. Must visit when you want great Mexican in Montreal"}
{"text":"Great place and vibe, legit Mexican place, so don't be put off by the Asian plates. I was told the Pastor tacos (marinated pork, onions, coriander, grilled pineapple and avocado sauce) are a big hit and it's true.  The price is $10 for 3 taco's, too be quite honest I can eat 6 of them :) Then again, I'm a big eater.  The Gringa quesadillas (marinated pork, cheese, corinader, onions and pineapple served with avocado sauce) $5 are a hit my little girl.  I do recommend this place if you want authentic Mexican food and that doesn't break the bank. Limited seating, so arrive before the dinner rush."}
{"text":"I've been craving their shrimp tacos since I came here a year ago. I'm almost ashamed as a Mexican to say that I love their fish tacos as I'm really strict with not liking Tex-Mex food since I find authentic Mexican food is miles better but this is my guilty pleasure. They do offer some more authentic options like a few of their tacos, they have horchata which is a delicious Mexican drink, frijoles and their deserts are often authentic, but honestly none of them come close to how delicious the shrimp tacos are."}
{"text":"Best Tacos al Pastor Ive had in the city and its in chinatown! Didnt try anything else though other than the Guacamole."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the flavors of this place.   The right amount of spice and flavors.  I hade the pastor tacos and I ( nor anyone) could find anything negative. Full tacos the way they're supposed to be.  I also had the beer batter shrimp tacos and I found just a touch too much batter but if they change that I have to give this place a 5 star."}
{"text":"la Capita is amazing!! I had an amazing time with the bartender  Zappa, he will for sure take care of you and host you all night. The food were good and last time I went I wasn't impressed with the sauce but this time it was super spicy which i lovvvv: thanks for the good times"}
{"text":"Wow! La Capital Tacos make some damn good tacos!  Came here for a quick bite to eat during dinner, took a while to be greated (we actually almost walked out, glad we did not though). Ordered the shrimp tacos and the hubby got the special of the day that came with 3 different tacos.   I could have ordered round after round of the shrimp tacos, it was like a flavour bomb going off during each bite. Amazing!  Also tried the jamaika margarita and it was delish! Def recommend.  Loved the vibe of this place, and the quick service. I did not notice any spiders on the ceiling as noted in the other reviews, so hopefully they got that problem fixed. The building that the restaurant is in has some wear and tear, but dont let that scare you away.  Seriously....check this place out...and please do yourself a favour and order the shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"Love that this place was open late. We were able to get a bite to eat once we got into Montreal. The good was very fresh and very flavorful. I had the ribeye tacos as well as the decried black beans with chips. The Atmosphere was fun, loud and laid back which is cool. Only thing negative I have to say was that it was pretty pricey for two orders of tacos (3 each order) and two drinks."}
{"text":"Really interesting hole in the wall unique flavours on a variety of tacos. Their drink menu is small but what I've tasted was really good my go to was their ceaser. In the picture we got al pastor tacos which were my favourite they had a lot of flavour and weren't to spicy. The mushroom tacos lacked flavour but were interesting  to try. The final taco I got was a chicken taco which was a little to spicy for my taste. Get a drink try some tacos try this place out"}
{"text":"Tasty tacos but terrible service. We ordered 2 additional tortillas as soon as our food came, but they never brought the additional tortillas. How difficult is it to bring 2 tortillas extra?"}
{"text":"3.5 Pretty good spot. I come here from time to time to curb my craving for tacos. The tacos Rosarito are a good bet. However their drinks didn't quite cut it."}
{"text":"Un mot: fantastique!!! Caché dans le quartier chinois, ce restaurant à saveurs authentiques est extra!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins for a freaking 5$ quesedilla only NEVER to receive it. Ask for a refund after 20min the lady waitress refused, then I had my Husband come in and ask for the refund. I got it and left! Failed first impression!"}
{"text":"J'y suis retournée récemment, il y avait plus de panure que de crevettes dans mes tacos aux crevettes et on a tous eu de la misère à digérer notre repas, dommage, j'avais préféré ma première expérience. Les drinks sont bons, le paloma et margarita sont tops"}
{"text":"I'm from California, Los Angeles and was visiting Canada conference. So through word of mouth I was told about this spot. I am really glad I stopped in, really authentic Mexican tacos and drinks. It really hit the spot for my cravings for some good tacos. really tasty and great vibe, nice waitress as well."}
{"text":"I didn't think this was authentic at all! Although this is coming from someone who's used to eating tacos out of taco trucks and small whole in the wall places in Los Angeles. It was a hipster twist on actual Mexican, I mean it was decent but not worth the high prices."}
{"text":"As a Mexican I was completely disappointed because the tacos where not close to authentic.  The salsa verde literally added no taste or spice and never in my life had I had pastor that was burnt..."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is about and why is it at 4 stars but nope. Never going back ever again.  First of all, I think that the prices are a little too high. I can't even remember what we ordered but they were all not worth it. I remember each bite wasn't pleasant. I felt forced to finish everything because it would be a waste of money and didn't want to be rude.   All to say, a lot of hipsters go there and I think it's more about the ''decor'' than the food itself. If I could I would give this place 0 stars. The waiter was nice but the rest of the staff just looked miserable.   I got there and regretted stepping in. I've had better Mexican food and this place is not even close to good. As in, I would much rather go to 3 amigos! Do you know how bad that sounds?!"}
{"text":"We came here based on yelp recommendations and we were not disappointed!  This is the definition of five stars, we are visiting from the states and usually the language barrier creates a problem but not here.  We actually killed two birds in one stone, tacos and were able to see China town. We were seated and attended quickly, food was taken and arrived quickly as well.  The carnita tacos were scrumptious with the sauces and the frijoles were too, everything had flavor and was fresh.  The flan chocolate cake was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"A Mexican restaurant in Chinatown in Montreal, Canada....who knew it would be SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Incredible place. Modern Mexican bar with great, cheap food, vegan options and fair prices. I would come back in a heartbeat.   Loved: Guac and chips Beet salad Vegan Tempeh Tacos El Pastor"}
{"text":"Best taco I've had in Montreal. Amazing! The spicy peanut sauce and lime complimented the beef taco so well. Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"I visited this place back when it had first opened. I ordered from the lunch menu, and on the side it was written \"soup + drink\", so I asked the waitress if it was included with any of the lunch meals, and she said that they all came with soup and drink. I proceeded to order from said menu and got myself a drink from their daily special drink. It tasted like heavily diluted juice, basically water with a touch of flavor and coloring. Who cares, I thought to myself, at least I can enjoy the water. The surprise came when I had to pay the bill. Apparently the soup and drink together were a good 4-5$ extra and not included with the lunch deal. Way to scam your customers when you've just opened the business.  At least the soup was decent."}
{"text":"We sat ourselves and the server brought us water and menus right away, and explained all the lunch items in detail. We ordered the refried bean dips and corn chips as a starter, then shared the Carnitas, the Pastor, and the Rosarito. The tacos themselves were not extraordinary, but the house made salsas and sauces were excellent. We had great service and the items we ordered were reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Un endroit parfait pour diner dans le quartier chinois ! J'avais des doutes au debut, car cest surprenant un restaurant de tacos parmis tous ces restaurants asiatiques ! Finalement, jai ete grandement surpris ! C'etait excellent , j'ai mange les tacos ribaye et l'entré de fromages roulés ! Les deux etaient à la fois differents des tacos que j'ai deja mangé et très gouteux !"}
{"text":"We went there to try this non Asian food restaurant right inside of Chinatown. We had the ribeye taco and also the pork and mushroom tacos. I tried two meat ones, both are ok, not bad but I feel it missing a bit seasoning. The baked or grilled spring onions are quite flavourful,but the portion is way too small! We paid 4or 5& for just 4 pieces of spring onions? That's just not funny."}
{"text":"This afternoon, my boyfriend and I were on our way home from being out in the rain all day and took a short cut through Chinatown.  We were hungry but were going to hold off until we got back later.  We walked past La Capital and saw the neon \"TACOS\" sign, and decided to turn around. SO thankful we did.  Amazing food, atmosphere and exactly what I could've asked for at that moment.  The shrimp tacos were delish!!"}
{"text":"Who knew chinatown would also host the best tacos in Montreal City!!!!"}
{"text":"Good value for money...we were here at 730 on a Saturday night and there was a line. We got in after 15 minutes. Their tacos al pastor was delish and a great value for only $10 with 3 tacos on the plate. The meat was seasoned well, cooked well with some toasty bits! The drinks were all above $10, reasonable except that they were a bit watered down. Expect to share a table with others as the place is small. I will go back when i find myself in Old Montreal again."}
{"text":"La capital is a French named Mexican taco place in Chinatown...awesome. It has a great atmosphere and the staff is awesome! We came in with 9 people and they made it work! Even with there limited space. There food is amazing I got the ribaye tacos.. I ended up ordering more they were so good. I also had a grilled cheese roll which was literally grilled cheese that is rolled. It wasn't what I was expecting but it was a new and interesting flavor to try! Their hot sauces on the table are really good and if your brave ask for some hot peanut based salsa...epic. It was quite the experience and would definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"Pour une cuisine mexicaine traditionnelle, PLutôt une ambiance bar que resto, les portions sont petites, mais qu'importe  J'ai aimé les tacos El Pastor, avec du porc mariné, des tortillas maison avec oignons, coriandre et ananas. J'ai aussi goûté aux tacos Rosarito, aveccrevettes panées, mayonnaise au piment chipotle, sauce à l'avocat, pico de galo, chou rouge.    Un must"}
{"text":"Excellente guacamole, les tacos sont bons sans plus (vraiment rien de fantastique) et l'alcool est relativement cher."}
{"text":"3.5*** is what I would give it. Weird to see a small Mexican taco restaurant, smack dab in the middle of Chinatown.  Went with a group of 6 people,so we all shared and swapped tacos to taste everything  They were good, we ordered the ribaye, fish and the pulled pork. The ribaye and fish tacos were good but the pulled pork was just ok.   The drinks were tasty, a little bit too much ice but at least you could taste the alcohol. Tequila shots are the average price 5$ each.   The tacos vary from 10$-15$. The entree/side are about 5$-9$.   The bathrooms needs some fixing,especially the door they're really hard to close.   Service was good attentive. It starts to get packed around 6:30-7pm."}
{"text":"Great food, small and unassuming place with a great ambiance in china town. Price is right for quality Mexican food served by real Mexicans. No a/c tho so it can get warm."}
{"text":"I had the vegan tacos, which were truly delicious, with a rich cashew crema. The bartender was overworked and so my drink (margarita jamaica) came out halfway through the meal, and was not memorable. It gets crowded but you can sit at the bar if you like. I gave myself plus points for being able to order in French in a Mexican restaurant in Chinatown ;)"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service despite being fairly busy. I had the pepper and mushroom taco and it was delicious. My friend ordered the tempeh taco and it was a little dry and less flavorful. The salsas on the table helped enhance the flavors a lot! Another friend ordered the shrimp tacos. They were deep fried and she seemed to enjoy them! Another friend ordered some kind of beef taco but asked to not have coriander so it was probably lacking a lot. We shared chips with beans and guacamole to start and it was very enjoyable! A great little taco place sitting oddly in Chinatown?!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. We got al pastor and beef tacos the taste is amazing. It's a home away from home. Visiting Canada from New York. Definitely coming back this weekend to try something else."}
{"text":"Trendy ambiance, excellent service, a little overprice but I would return for the tacos"}
{"text":"Just arrived in the city and wanted to eat. It is our first time in Montreal. The pictures looked good so we went there. The service was terrible, they took a long time and forgot some orders. We had to change order because they were out of 2 tacos dishes in a menu with around 5 options of tacos. The shrimp taco was really good but my friends beef taco was cold. At the end we had to ask for the bill more than once and the place was not full anymore, a mess... the total experience was a let down for a first step in the city. Not going back."}
{"text":"So far, it's the best tacos I've eaten since my trip to Mexico!!"}
{"text":"Petit resto mexicain tout simple avec une super ambiance ;) Nous avons commandé les tacos Rosarito aux crevettes panées (pas mal!) et au boeuf grillé Rib-Eye (dur à mâcher mais bon goût) car il n'y avait plus de tacos al pastor... :( Les frijoles étaient excellentes et goûteuses quoiqu'un peu sèches... Je les aime un peu plus coulantes disons ;) Il y a aussi une version \"Tacos al Pastor\" végé au tempeh. Nous avons bcp aimé les accompagnements/sauces! S'il y a bcp de monde, attendez-vous à partager votre table. Next time : al Pastor!"}
{"text":"I went during lunch and it was a mess. A happy lively mess.  I had my tacos at the bar and enjoyed peeping at the open kitchen.  Everything was seasoned and well rounded.  The small guacamole was enough for one. The guac and the homemade chips are standard. Solid standard, the good traditional stuff."}
{"text":"Really nice decor and good authentic Mexican tacos. But I would recommend to improve your services. I have been here on several occasions. In the beginning, I was served by what seem to be the owner of the place who always kept checking on our table to see how we were doing and now the waiter/waitress don't even bother checking if we need anything, til it's time to pay the bill. Bittersweet experience."}
{"text":"Excellente ambiance !!! Les Proprios nous ont fait déguster du mezcal et des crickets rôtis!  Options vegan et végétarien Bar: Excellent cocktails maison"}
{"text":"Tacos down at Chinatown; La Capital Tacos had the cozy Chinatown vibe to it. If you're around Town and looking for some tacos, check the spot out then go for some dragon beard candy and bubble tea afterwards!  On to the food: I ordered some of their Carnitas tacos while starting off with some grilled beets, along with some chips & guacamole. I liked it, I should've asked for some more of that sauce though... #keveatsregrets"}
{"text":"For the time I was in Montreal, I was pretty sure I've gorged myself on all types of Canadian staples already. I wanted something much more interesting and when I read about a taqueria that has managed to pop up in Montreal's Chinatown, I had to have it.   My friend and I wandered in and seated ourselves at the bar two hours before closing. At first I thought it was odd that we hadn't been served or attended to but I noticed that they were slammed. I love the quasi Asian-Mexican ambiance of La Capital, especially the waving cat with the luchador mask!   My friend and I decided to order the guacamole and chips to start and the Pastor and Carnitas tacos for entrees. For drinks I ordered a caipirinha while my friend had a jarrito. The tacos came first. The Pastor taco was perfectly seasoned. Although I typically do not like raw onions, they complimented the flavors of the taco, giving a contrasting bite to the taco. The hint of sweetness brought on by the pineapple accents the pork. Already convinced that La Capital knew what they were doing, I tried my friend's Carnitas taco. It's a shame I didn't get a picture (cause I ate it). The Carnitas were delicious as well. The meat itself, despite looking dry, was so succulent and juicy that it didn't need any extra sauces.   After eating our three tacos each, my friend and I decided to split the Cochinita Pibil Tacos. It tasted similar to the carnitas but had a different flavor profile. What really stood out about the Cochinita Pibil was the accompaniment on top. Having the picked onions with the taco really highlighted the flavor of the pork. On the side they had their house spicy pickled onions. What seemed like a normal onion, was probably one of my favorite things about La Capital. The initial heat of the onions gave way to a sweet-sour picked onion flavor. Their bartender told me that they pickle the onions with spicy peppers and nothing else, preserving the white translucency of the onion.   Out of all the foods I've eaten in Montreal for this most recent trip, I think that La Capital tops the charts in food I've eaten. It's funny but I came to Montreal expecting my favorite thing to either be poutine or the bagels but La Capital Tacos takes the win."}
{"text":"Solid delicious tacos. Reasonable price but not cheap. Need about $20 of tacos to get stuffed."}
{"text":"Tacos in Chinatown? Seems rather random but hey, why not. There's a few clever details showing that La Capital Tacos is happily integrated in its multicultural neighbourhood: e.g. the melamine plates are decorated with chinese patterns, and a cute \"lucha libre\" fortune cat can be seen near the counter.  We went for an early lunch and immediately liked the large wooden tables and vintage look of the restaurant. It was a sunny day, and the dining room seemed cool and shady. We ordered tacos al Pastor and Rosarito, and \"coco water\", which was kind of a pina colada without alcohol. The plates came fairly fast and looked beautiful. Three tacos might not feel like a lot, but these had generous portions of meat. The shrimps in the Rosarito were tender and flavorful, and the shredded cabbage added volume and crunch to the dish. The pork from the al Pastor turned out a bit dry, so I relied on the sauces provided on the table (which were delicious). We weren't actually full after all this, but it was a very pleasant lunch. I think it might have been better if we went with friends and tried all of their different tacos!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and lively ambiance. I ordered the beer battered shrimp tacos and shared a side order of frijoles and guacamole with friends. The tacos were super yummy and filling, the sides were all delicious and the staff gives free chip refills. The cocktails are also great. The place is worth the price although it is a little bit of a splurge. Would recommend if you are going out with friends/want to treat yourself."}
{"text":"This. Is. It. The best guacamole I've ever had (not counting the one my boyfriend makes). It tastes so creamy and avocad-y and delicious. They do sprinkle some tomatoes and onions at the top but I just scooped those out. It also has a small hint of lime which I loved.  I ordered the beef quesadilla and it was so goooooood. A great mix of beef and cheese (which I dipped into my guacamole).   I also got to try their frijoles refritos and watch out Ta Chido. They serve theirs lukewarm and it makes such a difference.  Super fun restaurant. Tacos in chinatown? Heck yeah. Everything was served in oriental dishes and it looked so cool. Everyone was friendly while they were serving us. So worth it!"}
{"text":"I always wondered why there's a random taco restaurant in chinatown, but I decided to try it out. Actually quite delicious! And the service was friendly.   I ordered the sauté mushrooms tacos. I'm actually quite pleased that a vegetarian dish can be so flavorful! Not many restaurants can achieve this. The only downfall was that it was 11$ taxes excluded for 3 tiny tacos. If only there were more for the price!   We sat near the brick wall side of the restaurant and can't help notice that there are cobwebs and dust hanging off the walls. Hopefully they'll clean that soon. Would hate to have that fall onto a customer."}
{"text":"Great place for tacos pretty authentic and delicious!!! I enjoyed the beef tacos they were pretty tasty and well seasoned. Just thought a bit expensive for what it is but can't I've had better tacos in Montreal ;)"}
{"text":"Very very good tacos. I particularly like the carnitas. My vegetarian partner had several good options on the menu. The location was also perfect on our last visit - right by where we needed to change buses coming from the airport. They even accomodated our luggage:)"}
{"text":"We was in MONTREAL for few days with my family and my wife found this place. First this place is in CHINATOWN, Montreal center, The MEXICAN FOOD  is the Best  I live in MIAMI  and we have good Mexican food here but THE CAPITAL TACOS mis respetos, Super recomendados. Amazing  Si vas a MONTREAL, QUEBEC y quieres comer rico ve a este restaurante. Las chicas muy atentas"}
{"text":"Last Saturday night, my sister and drove by La Capital. Our reaction was like anyone else, \"a taco place in Chinatown?!\" *confused face* my sister proposed that we try it out, so impromptu taco night it was!   Good: the server greeted us and was seated right away. It's a charming little spot with exposed brick walls and a warm ambiance. We asked for recommendations since it was our first time checking it out, and we ended up going with the battered shrimps tacos. Hands down, the best tacos I've ever had. Filling, well portions and reasonably priced. It reminds me of the food I've had in LA. You know the food is good when it brings back good memories.  Bad: no negative comments. Maybe the hot sauce wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be, but that's not even significant in comparison to how much I've enjoyed the meal.  Bottom line: I've mentally made plans for who I intend to bring to this establishment. I've had such hospitable service and amazing food, I'm just excited to return again."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, excellent service! I loved the Guacamole, the carnitas taco and the White IPA"}
{"text":"Really cool place that's reasonably priced good food and service was awesome. Vegetarian options."}
{"text":"If you are an arachnophobia person, don't ever get close to this place!!!  Worse place ever!!! Unless you are not afraid of spiders, that you will not be disgusted by their bathroom neither by the slow and bad service...  They have plenty (spiders)....  The waitress tell us that:  \"oh it's ok they won't bite you as I fed them this morning\";   The manager pulled a let saying, when I asked to move table as 2 of the big spiders (besides of plenty of others...) kept fighting and coming down, \"ohhh no worries I will take them down, I won't move you other seats\"  what he never did (remove the spiders) ...  So, 15 minutes after that we got our food, what was basically 45-60 minutes after we got there plus 20-30 minutes outside waiting), he came to us and said: \"ohhh I'm sorry but it would make too much noise at the restaurant to take them out... )  Food was ok, service super slow. They share tables between people what me and my friends had no problem at all with, but we had with the fact that they got their drinks and food much before us, and we got our seats and order much before they got their seats!!!)  They never excused themselves for the slow service, neither for the spiders circumstances and not even offer a drink or a rebate... Opposite, I got an extra drink in our bill but I paid without saying a word to not need to stay longer!!!  Take a look in their dust of the fixtures, the spiders moving around in their ceilings, and also the black spots at their sign outside (if you zoom it, you will see the spiders!!!)  Worst experience ever!!! I don't recommend this place to anyone, if I could put ZERO starts... I would, but the minimum is 1, so 1 it is..."}
{"text":"I really liked the tacos, but the price is a bit steep considering the amount of food you get. Especially considering that for the same price you can get a lot of good food in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Very good Tacos !! So far the most authentic tacos Mexican I have tried in Montreal, pastor is pretty good, rosarito and ribaye !! And the betabel salad delicious !!"}
{"text":"Simple menu with about 6 types of tacos, 4 quesadillas and a few entrees.  We tried 3 tacos & 2 quesadillas. Every single one was fresh and delicious. The tortillas are even toasted to be a little golden.  Nothing was spicy, but they do put hot sauce on table which is a necessary addition for me. What's Mexican food without a little spice right?  The mojito was good, and the margarita I found strong.  Prices are fair and the service is great. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"What a pleasant discovery to find this little gem in Chinatown.   The service was great and the waiter was super friendly and helpful. He proposed a few recommendations for everyone's taste.   The group of friends I was with all enjoyed their choices, and I definitely did as well. The shrimp tacos were simply delicious. I will absolutely be back soon.  Goal: try all the different types of tacos.   See you soon La Capital !"}
{"text":"Saved this little treat for our last night in Montreal.  Mexican in Chinatown.. loved the theme!  Was pretty crowded when we arrived, but only waited around 15 mins to be seated at the bar (got just in time on a sat night, mind you.. the line kept growing after that). - Authentic taste (none of that burrito, sour cream, jack cheese, everything-on-top nonsense). Tried the Guacamole, Ensalada Callejera, Order of Carnitas and Al Pastor. - Great drinks - Friendly service  Being a Norteña, this definitely hit the spot and made me feel at home."}
{"text":"Yikes. We planned days ahead to go here based on Yelp reviews. Pretty scuffed up place. We sat down even though it was about ten degrees hotter inside than out. Really, like 90 degrees F. Inside.   We were willing to stick it out until we saw the \"napkins.\"  The restaurant's idea of a casual place setting was to throw a big roll of cheap, brown bathroom refill paper on each table. Yuck. We totally lost our appetite and left."}
{"text":"Une soirée entre filles. Dumplings ou tacos? Ok Tacos! Ou ça?? Quartier chinois?? Oui mon amie connaissait, je ne me doutais absolument pas de l'existence de cette place ici. On ouvre la porte et nous voilà rendu en Amérique du Sud, lumières tamisées, musique ambiance latine, c'est le fun! Petites tables de 4 ou grandes tablées à partager... C'est convivial! Le guacamole est servi dans de la vaisselle chinoise, petit clin d'il sympathique! Une Margarita, du guacamole et des tacos... Parfait. Nous avons essayé le \"rib-eye\"(buf) mon préféré, le Carnitas (porc) et le rosaritos(crevette panée) Nous nous sommes régalées! Le service est vraiment sympathique. Je n'ai pas beaucoup de restaurants de tacos à mon actif, mais celui ci m'a beaucoup plu! J'ai trouvé ça un poil cher cependant.  Je recommande!"}
{"text":"Was not expecting authentic, exquisitely prepared Mexican food! The Chinatown location threw me off. Excellent attentive wait staff. Cochinia pibil Yucatan pulled pork tacos, better than I had in Cancun! Icy cold corona beer. This place was packed very laid back casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"You can pass right by this restaurant and not even notice it, but I'm so grateful that didn't happen to me !  The tacos are fairly small but packed with flavour , and great meat portions. The sauce served with the tacos is delicious !"}
{"text":"Solid little taco place, tasty, however, I found the presentation lacking and the prices a little expensive for what you get.  I also thought the staff friendly, but a tad unprofessional in some of their interactions... especially with each other. The atmosphere is a bit tatty, as well."}
{"text":"You know for having \"Mexican\" tacos in Montreal these where awesome!! We ordered the black bean dip with chips and papas fritas and loved them then we ordered the shrimp tacos and they where great! Only thing is unless you are drinking a margarita or michelada they only serve soda for Non-alcoholic drinks. Just keep that in mind."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here. Let me start, by saying that I used to live in Florida, and I have worked for a Latin-American news publication before... so I have had a higher than normal exposure to authentic Latin-American.   The tacos are pretty authentic Mexican. I am used to a little thinner, more corn-ish, double tortilla, but the outside wasn't bad. The inside was delicious, except for the fact that they ran out of steak. At that point they were down to carnitas and pastor, and I don't like pastor. It feels like they need one additional meat option --- this is where they are lacking in.   I recommend they add...  Barbacoa Res Chicken  OR Costilla Puerco (Baby Pork Ribs)  The other thing they need to improve upon a little is their salsa. Everything was so mild, except for the hot stuff, which was more like \"medium\" by Mexican standards. It was delicious, but I did crave something hotter.   Overall though, I was quite surprised to find the real deal."}
{"text":"We are visiting from the U.S.  Our meal was delicious and the service was superb.  We were a party of 4 and when we walked in every table was taken.  There were two people sitting at a 4 top, and the hostess graciously asked them to please move to the bar, so they could continue to have their cocktails.  I thought this was so thoughtful of the hostess and the customers.  This would have never happened back at home.    Thank you for your fine hospitality and the excellent dinner!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing when I visited MTL recently. As a native of Southern California, I *know* and *love* my tacos, and I *LOVE* La Capital! During a 7 day stay in MTL I ate at La Capital 4 times. The carne asada quesadilla (pirata) and the shrimp tacos (rosarito) were the jams, with a side of the bean dip (frijoles refritos) for some extra tastiness! This place was worth waiting for when there was a line, and worth sweating for since there is no AC and the place becomes a sauna when packed on a warm afternoon/evening. Their special lemonades were also a tasty way to deal with the heat.   There are some places I wish I could give 0 stars, but this place might deserve 6, especially considering it's in Chinatown in Montreal, Canada..."}
{"text":"Food is served on mun shou plates as latin music and fast spanish orders blast in the background. Menu items (as well as their restaurant sign) also have chinese translation: these guys are wholeheartedly embracing their chinatown location and running with it as their theme. Certainly the first time I see a Mexican-Chinese fusion, and dare I say, it's not a bad marriage!   That said, the tacos are no fusion byproduct: they are probably the best in the city and rival those in others in terms of taste and authenticity!   Vegetarians, fear not! The El Pastor can be made vegetarian with tempeh substitution, and there is also a mushrooms taco.   Our table of 4 ordered the El Pastor, Carnitas, Rosaritos and the vegetarian El Pastor. We each thought ours was so good that we didn't want to share! (Of course we relented, sharing is caring).  Service is friendly. I was given a whole bowl when I asked for another lime wedge because mine was dried out.   As we line up to pay, a lucha libre lucky cat greets us by the cash register. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Guacamole awesome. Place open late was still crowded but was served quickly. Had the carnitas. Top notch."}
{"text":"It's a great place for tourist since the restaurant is located in ChinaTown!  The staff was super friendly, and we were offered free guacamole and chips (which were delicious and so fresh) because the food was taking longer than usually to be prepared. The meat in the tacos was a bit too cooked, hence making the tacos ordinary. I also had the cheese coned but was not impressed since it really didn't taste good... I'm glad I went once but I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"This cozy taco spot just opened and its already doing very well, lunch is always packed so I tend to go after the rush. The tacos are excellent and its not expensive. Soon to be serving beer."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Montreal. Definitely try the guacamole and if you like shrimps, the Rosarito taco is a must-have."}
{"text":"We were in Chinatown when my daughter was whining about wanting taco's . And then we found this place . Everything was authentic , she had the shrimp tacos , they had a sweet corn dog type batter , very unique but delicious I had the ribeye tacos , the beef was tender and well cooked , so much flavour . Served on corn tortillas with an amazing chipotle sauce and even better salsa verde . We started with crispy corn chips and guacamole , made our tastebuds sing , seriously folks , don't pass up the opportunity to stop here next time your in Chinatown"}
{"text":"Seriously good tacos at La Capital. The food is incredible and authentic. My table shared a large guacamole with homemade tortilla chips (yum) while we were waiting for the rest of our group to arrive. It didn't come with nearly enough chips for the amount of guacamole, but they will bring refills if you ask. My order of ribeye tacos (3 for $13) was tasty and filling. They use corn tortillas which are super flavorful and really add to the taste of the tacos. There are 3 types of salsa, 2 mild and 1 that is quite spicy.  I have to admit that we weren't the best customers. We waited almost an hour for the rest of our group to arrive while the restaurant was packed. Despite that, the waiters were very friendly and once we finally placed our orders the service was fast. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"La Captial Tacos is such a cute joint located in Montréal's Chinatown and open till 2 am (say whaaa?) I went there on a chilly Friday night and it was pretty busy but we managed to snag seats at the high tables. The Mexican-Chinese fusion aesthetic is one that I can get on board with. Their table set-up is a little ineffective but has a communal vibe which I can get on board with. I had the el pastor which was lovely and the Mexican coke was also very good. We also got the tortilla chips with the bean dip (I don't remember the name - apologies) which I enjoyed! The bill came to about $19 after tip each and the service was impeccable. Do come here if you're looking for good tacos and good service but I will say that the food is not incredibly filling! Ps: their plates are über cute!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Fun atmosphere, great drinks, delicious tacos. We had guacamole, shrimp tacos and pork tacos. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Taco of the day: Brisket with BBQ sauce and a super spicy avocado sauce. Amazing. It was a top notch meal. Selection seemed limited but they take great care in what they prepare. A little too loud with the music, and margarita's were small. Took a while to prepare but excellent as well."}
{"text":"Super tacos here, as close as it ges to the Mexican streetcorners! Really highly recommended if you like authentic Mexican streetfood."}
{"text":"Had the Carnitas tacos. Very good quality - fast and friendly service. Delicious. Nice atmosphere. Oh yeah.   Authentic. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I haven't had such crappy service in a restaurant in my life as far as i can remember.   I placed my order, then 30 mins later the waitress comes back telling me that half the items i ordered aren't available. I of course was disappointed as to why she hadn't told us 25 mins ago. So we go ahead and order other items to curb our now famished selves. She comes back 10 mins later saying said items aren't available either. Our patience being tested, we order again another item. She comes back 5 mins later saying it isn't available. I really thought i was being pranked. We basically ordered 3-4 times and waited about an hour for anything to arrive at our table.  The food failed to impress. Big time. It was cold and bland. I only liked the beans.  The only reason i didn't walk out is because i was famished and really craving Mexican. Being in chinatown i didn't wanna trek to the plateau.   To top it all... our waitress ends her shift and leaves nonchalantly without saying a word to us. I was F L O O R E D. We were left without a waitress and had to get up and chase down a bus boy for our bill.    I hope the owners read this. Service is everything guys!! Hire proper wait staff, train them. If you have no food to serve, then close down and go buy food. You are a restaurant! People expect food.   I saw a table of 6-8 people leave because you had no food at 2pm!!"}
{"text":"Il on même pas beaucoup de choix! Il avait pas de  guacamole et il mon servi des crevettes pané POURRI  il était BLEU!! inacceptable!!!! PU JAMAIS !!"}
{"text":"Nice place, small but tasty menu. I had the cheese chicharron and the cochinita pibil taco. The food was tasty, and it reminded me of some great old places in California - the real taquerias - well outside of Mexico. Since the restaurant is in Chinatown, it was amusing to see the China was Chinese. Service was somewhat slow and our appetizers came late while our main meal came a minute later, having barely had a taste of our starters. I hate it when the kitchen doesn't even try to space things apart. Nonetheless, the food was excellent and tasted pretty authentic so it's still well worth a visit if you're craving for Mexican in Montreal"}
{"text":"Great place for some good taco! Went there aroung 6pm on a weekday and it was already full of people. We were 2 and it just happened that they had a free table. But 20mins later, there was a huge line up! I don't think they do reservations so, be early! The staff is very friendly and the service is pretty decent.   The serving is good, we ordered 3 types of tacos(3), so we shared 9 tacos in total. That was just anough for both my friend an I. The tacos comes with little sauce that compliments them pretty well.   I will definitely come back to try out something different from the menu."}
{"text":"Hands down yummy delicious tacos!! Their cheese roll is very good-if you like crispy baked Parmesan! Simple decor with wide window panels. Service was great and staffs were all friendly! Definitely a spot to come back to. Fish, steak, pork.. all delicious!"}
{"text":"Mexican food in china town! Was a little skeptical but glad I tried it! Cool ambiance, good music. Service was good and friendly. Food was delicious and authentic. Ordered the guacamole with chips (fresh and tasty) and the cochinitas pibil tacos (3 tacos each order)-super yummy!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a kyoot n tasty place!  I showed up to the area early for an event over on St Cat. A quick Yelp search led me to this place which I had bookmarked ages ago but hadn't got around to trying. I walked right past it despite scouring both sides of the street in search of it (convinced the address was wrong when I entered China Town in search of a mexican place?!?) Sure enough it was the one with the plain black signage with the fancy font La Capital in white, totally unassuming for a mexi joint!   Place was empty-ish when I arrived at 5pm on a Wednesday evening. I was ushered away from a 4-person table in the corner and politely pointed to the few tables they accepted for just 2 people to eat at. But they were friendly throughout the process despite me finding it very strange considering it was ghost town.   I was brought menus and they totally didn't mind that me n my dad just ended up having appetizers, a beer for my dad and a glass of red wine for me. The rest of the food was tantalizing but didn't want to fill up before our event.   Ordered:  - Small guacamole entrée: delicious and fresh,  but for someone who loves onion as much as I do...it's a tad too heavy on the onion.   - Frijoles entrée: a bit of a funky taste compared to most black bean dips I've tried but a nice portion, consistency and flavour anyways.  - the beer: well they didn't bring my dad a glass which he was perplexed by, but refused my offer to ask for one for him, so that's on dad!   - the glass of red wine: supposedly a \"pinot-esque\" wine nourassa or sumthin like that...absolutely DISGUSTINGGGGG and served ice cold booooooo!!! I did not drink it and politely let them know it was terrible when they brought my bill. And the waiter took my bill right back and removed the glass of wine!! I found that super sweet because I wouldn't have even asked for that, I wanted to support the cute place and felt it was my bad for ordering wine in a mexi place. Won bigggg points with me on that account!   Price of everything was ridiculously affordable ! Service was spectacular and friendly and they even brought us extra chips for the dips!!   So totally coming back here to try the tacos n quesadillas!!! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"You gotta get Mexican food in Chinatown in Montreal, duh.   This little hot spot made me soooo happy on our Canadian excursion. After many days I was really craving tacos, which we eat all the time at home. Distance makes the heart grow fonder, and I was thrilled to see La Capital pop up on Yelp when I searched for nearby lunch finds. You wouldn't expect this restaurant to be nestled amongst the many pho and ramen places or Asian food markets, but it's there and it's wonderful.  It's ultra casual inside and pretty crowded at lunch time. Concrete floors, big heavy tables, and a tiny bar space (although they don't serve any alcohol as of now). They're got fresh squeezed juice on the menu, and then their speciality - authentic tacos. Chicken, fish, carnitas, steak, al pastor... the classics. We started with the chips and guacamole, which were wonderful. The chips are pretty dark and initially looked like they might be over-fried, but they tasted great. The guacamole was delicious as well, and super fresh. There are 3 different types of salsa in little plastic squeezy bottles... I believe my favorite was the green/verde, which was super-fresh, cool, and cilantro-y.  We also ordered a side of refried beans which I LOVED. Amazing authentic flavor with just the right amount of cheese on top. We decided on the 3 plate al pastor tacos for our entree. Our waitress actually forgot to put in our order, and we waited for quite awhile before we realized and asked her to double check. She was super apologetic and even brought us one extra taco free of charge. I was happy because the tacos were delicious. The meat was incredibly tender and the fresh pineapple is always a beautiful accompaniment. Plus, the corn tortillas appeared to be homemade - wonderful texture and just the right thickness.  Be prepared to wait for a seat right at lunchtime. Chinatown is already super busy with tourists, and this restaurant is one-of-a-kind in the neighborhood! I think it'd be worth the wait, however. One of my favorite places during our trip."}
{"text":"So far first impression is not good.   Place isn't clean and there are spiders hanging from the ceiling.  When we told the weight staff he said that he fed it earlier today.   They took an eternity to get us our orders.  We got our orders after the people that got there after us.  When we finally got our food it was ok.  Not like the reviews others left.  We ate our food fast because we were afraid the spiders would fall in us.  We should've went with our first impression and not stayed."}
{"text":"J'aurais bien mis un 3.5* et je m'explique. On était au bar et on voyait la cuisine s'activer, je trouve ça toujours sympa ! On a commandé un gros guacamole pour l'apéro avec un cocktail. Les deux étaient bons mais sérieusement 7$ pour un guacamole de cette taille c'est pas normal. La portion me semblait si petite que j'ai bien demandé confirmation de la portion de guacamole. Il devait y avoir un demi avocat. Cher pour ce que c'était. Les tacos sont arrivés, nous avions pris les deux choix végétariens. 3 tacos avec champignons et 3 tacos avec du tempeh mariné al pastor. C'était bon et original et c'est un bon point :) L'expérience culinaire était sympa mais au final on s'en est tiré pour presque 50$ pour un cocktail, un \"gros\" guacamole et 6 tacos végétariens. Pour moi le prix n'est pas bon marché. Je ne pense pas revenir à cause de ce point."}
{"text":"very welcoming staff. Everyone is super friendly. I got the tacos al pastor, carnitas and the gringa quesadilla. tacos al pastor were OK. the carnitas and the quesadilla were amazinggggg. I loved it...would recommend."}
{"text":"Exactly the place we were looking for. Guacamole is so good and you can add 3 different homemade salsas to get the spicy-ness you want.   The tacos are delicious. Good portion size.   Enchiladas are also amazing  Simple menu but it is perfect!  The restaurant itself is small but cozy.   Waiter was very friendly."}
{"text":"Late night gem. Great vegan tacos, solid gauc, could seriously use better late night bar service, I was told beers only but saw shots being taken 5 minutes before I left, I would've bought several maragiritas  ..."}
{"text":"Waitress was great. Very attentive to our table. The tacos, quesadilla's and sides were awesome. Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"In the midst of many Asian style restaurants on Saint Laurent St, I didn't expect to find a Mexican restaurant like this!   Having been in Mexico for a summer, I was excited to see Tacos al Pastor (meat with pineapple, onion and cilantro). However, I was slightly disappointed because you only get one tiny slice of pineapple on each taco! I recommend asking for more pineapple if you can.  Additionally, you get 3 small corn tacos (which are very filling) for about $10-12.   I find this to be a bit expensive considering the entree does not come with any side dishes. Finally, this meal doesn't come with chips and/or salsa! We added on a side of guacamole, but revived a tiny bowl of about 10 chips. This guac was about $7 which I find to be ridiculous!   I was slightly disappointed with La Capital, but the wait service was very good."}
{"text":"Left us waiting without so much as a menu or acknowledgement for over 10 minutes. Ended up just walking out."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and a great stop for a bite during the just for laughs festival. Random place for a Mexican restaurant right in heart of China town l, seems like there are others opening up as well.   I'm always impressed the the freshness of the meat and quality of the tacos. The hot sauce (green) is amazing. It did take a while to get the food out but seeing that they are cooking on a grill and fresh I'll wait a bit.  The tortillas are super soft and  loved the beaf rib eye. Home made salsa has a kick and packed with flavor. I like that it's not over dressed with sauces.. I can appreciate the the flavor of the meat. I also recommend the fish tacos..  They also have vegetarian option..  when I first went they didn't have a liquor license. Now that they do the selection is quite good. Yes they do have corona with a slice of lime!  As for the decor .. if u ever been to Mexico it's not meant to be over the top .. I can't say it's eye catching at all but it's doesn't have to be. I like the common seating it brings that friendly social environment. If ur not very social that look at ur plate and partner. If you are well make new friends!  I find it nice that the summer the front is completely open with sliding doors. So yes we don't live alone on this earth there will be spiders and bugs! A spider can build a complete  web in 30min...expect to see them around. I don't expect the staff to start swatting flys and bugs all night long. I personally haven't been attacked by them lol .. if you leave u windows open all day you will have uninvited guests. Montreal's summer days are numbered I'm glad we can enjoy the open air at a restaurant ..  If you happen to go when there are festivals expect a line.. and it could take a while."}
{"text":"Cinco de Mayo. Big night right? Ordered a margarita and take out pre-drunko rush. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Margarita was served frozen with some inventive lime zest, but lacked in flavor and punch. I could barely taste the tequila, which I needed after a long week. Take out tacos came fast. 1) they got my order wrong, as in skipped the shrimp tacos I'd been eager to try. 2) however the pulled pork tacos were phenomenal! Much better than the traditional pastor I was mistakenly given.  STELLAR salsa Verde.  I hope it was just an off night, because the place had a great vibe. Will try again."}
{"text":"Everything was great and we had one order of each taco on their menu along with the drink special if the night. We ended up with full bellies and the food was definitely worth paying for !:)"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????taco??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Cool spot in Chinatown. Dining setup is a bit strange.. they have all kinds of sized tables and they're very popular so be ready to share your table. On a rainy Monday night, there were people rolling in continuously between 8 and 10pm! ...with reason because the tacos are great. I wasn't impressed by the service (they seem to be understaffed for the amount of people) and I didn't really like my cocktail. My boyfriend also tried the beets entrée which wasn't worth it. Stick to the tacos and you'll be satisfied! I also like the chinese touch of having the food served on 'oriental' plates."}
{"text":"Three star tacos. They really need to put some effort in to making a decent sauce...had the rib eye tacos, meat was tasty, tortilla as well. The cebollita that came with the platter was really cebollín... the sauce is what usually gives a taco its soul, but it was watery and bland. The last bit of comment is that the music in the background is not what you'd usually hear at a taco joint...it's Latin alright, but not very Mexican."}
{"text":"Nice and simple. Delicious tacos, great price, low-key ambiance."}
{"text":"Je suis à la quête des meilleurs tacos à Montréal depuis que le restaurant El Camino à Ottawa a brisé mon orgueil de Montréalais.   J'ai découvert La Capital par hasard et je me suis senti obligé d'essayer en vitesse leurs tacos de porc (produit benchmark). Je peux vous garantir que ce n'est pas la dernière fois que j'y mettais les pieds. De loin, c'est le taco de maïs le mieux réussi de Montréal, belle grosseur et pas trop dense.   La place est sans prétention et le décor est intéressant. Tout le monde a droit à deux bouteilles de sauce, une salsa verde et une tomate (pas trop) piquante et à un rouleau de papier brun pour s'essuyer les mains. Bref, sur le produit et sans snobisme.  Chaudement recommandé aux fans de mexicain authentique!"}
{"text":"I have to hand it to this Mexican restaurant for opening up in China town. Great restaurant with fresh ingredients. I mean the guacamole is exactly how I love it, not too minced and has small chunks of avocado. The rib eye taco is my favourite and that sauce that comes with it makes me want to eat them until I explode. The sauce is a blend of jalapeño, garlic and some other magical ingredients that I can't remember. The shrimp taco was decent, I didn't like the mayo in it but that is just me because I am picky. Overall it is one of the better Mexican restaurants in the city. Only dock is it is a little pricey, but the quality is there. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"La nourriture était délicieuse, les prix respectables, les options diverses. Il y avait certains choix végétariens, la cuisine est ouverte jusqu'à tard la nuit la fin de semaine. Le service était bien, le décor est sympathique. Un chouette endroit où manger des tacos :)"}
{"text":"What a gem!  My friend suggested this restaurant and I admit that at first I was skeptical. Since living in California I generally avoid Mexican food anywhere else as it is likely to disappoint. Not this time!!  A cosy and very busy reataurant in Chinatown that serves some amazing tacos! I tried the Shrimp tacos my friend had the steak tacos and husband had tempe tacos. All arrived really fast and were absolutely delicious. Service is perfect as well, incredibly friendly servers.  Oh and did I mention the bottomless guacamole and chips? So much yum!"}
{"text":"Found this gem in the middle of Chinatown! Amazing food and great ambiance. The tacos were great, we ordered the steak one and the shrimp. The shrimp one was by far the best, very fresh and unique flavor. Good portions, three tacos per plate. We also had the beans with chips, which were also pretty good. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Authentic mexican cuisine at its finest! Before getting there I was scared it was gonna be another fast \"mexican\" restaurant like lots of them out there, but the overall was unexpected. The guacamole was smooth and crunchy with some peppers and onions and the chips coming with it wasnt some cliché tostitos, but real thick corn flour tortillas. The tacos I ordered were the \"Ribaye\" if im correct, a big piece of beef on each tacos topped with fresh coriander and grilled onions along with a lightly spicy/lemony sauce. Usually, im disatisfied in retaurants when I order a beef dish, because I get so little of a meat for what im paying, but this dish had the perfect amount of beef on every tacos for only 13$! There's not enough spaces tho, so coming in a big group might not be a great idea :/ They had a great variety of drinks that seemed really nice but I didnt get any this day. I highly recommend this place if you have a taco craving! (haha)"}
{"text":"This place was great!!! We walked in for lunch on our way to explore Chinatown and downtown Montreal and we're very impressed with the authenticity of the food and the service.   We tried the guacamole, chips, tacos al pastor, and carnitas tacos. All were superb and honestly was one of the best meals we've had in Montreal thus far. I would just suggest more grilled pineapple on the pastor tacos....mostly because I love grilled pineapple. :)"}
{"text":"The feel of the restaurant, the interior, the atmosphere makes this Mexican cuisine a gem. Exceptional tacos, great quesadillas and drinks are worth the wait. Regardless if you're out with your family, with friends or on a date, the commotion in and outside adds to a nice overall experience. If you're hungry when you arrive, get the guacamole as an appetizer."}
{"text":"To be fair, I judged this place as \"too hipster to be really good Mexican\" before even trying it, and wow was I ever wrong. And I take it back: the decor was beautiful and clean and the food was fantastic. It's is a fun spot in Chinatown, and we only had to wait a few minutes to get a table even if the pace was packed. Staff is great, both the host and our waitress were perfect, attentive, and really friendly.   The food: we had the mushroom quesadilla,  the beer battered shrimp tacos, the tempeh tacos. Tempeh was deliciously marinated (seriously, tasted like chicken), the mushrooms as well were spot on, even if a bit heavy. We also started with the best refried black beans I have ever had (we all agree) and the most delicious roasted beet salad that, as a cook, surprised me. I will have to try that. Sweet but also smokey.   Drinks were good, menu was small but tasty. Only comment that we all had was that we left feeling like the meal sat really heavy and it's still digesting in my stomach.. but now I definitely know where to go when I am craving this again. Oh, and the place is quite tiny."}
{"text":"I would say authentic Mexican taco. The environment was nice and beer are fairly cheap. Service can be slow if the place gets busy, especially if the waiters forgot about you sitting at the corner. Waited 20 minuets without water and still got the wrong tacos. The weirdest part was after we got a waitress's attention, she looked at us  like we just stole her money. Totally bizarre experience. Good food, bad service."}
{"text":"They have quick good food. My family and I came here on  a Friday around 5 and we all enjoyed the food. The guacamole with chips were a nice starter. We had the ribeye tacos, cochinita taco and a quesadillas. It was all very tasty. The salsa aren't really spicy but gives your food a little kick. They have good customer service which is part of the experience."}
{"text":"Honestly soooo overrated, I get that Montréal doesn't have many authentic taco places, but please don't think that this is the best you can do.  Frijoles have an intense smokey flavour that just doesn't belong. Guac is alright, no more no less. I had the carnitas and the pork was very dry. My friend had the shrimp one and was underwhelmed; the option to grill the shrimp rather than deep fry them should be offered. Apparently the tempeh al pastor was alright, but lacked a punch of some sort.  If you come at peak dinner time, be prepared to wait outside for a while and expect slow service (although the employees are all very sweet)  So yeah, not a must-try."}
{"text":"Probably best tacos in mtl. So far . We had shrimp tacos and the carnitas also,they were everything  good tacos should be. The roasted beet salad and the guacamole with chips were very delicious too.washed that down with an amazing margarita. Good friendly service from all the waiters and food was on the table within minutes. Definetely a go to again and again.  Thanks le capital tacos"}
{"text":"Amazinggggg tacos! Ordered the al pastor tacos and it got me craving for more! The al pastor was so well flavored. The avocado sauce on the side was creamy and delicious! People it is worth the wait !!!"}
{"text":"Since I have been to Mexico, I can say here I got a really tasty food which reminds me the good times of Mexico. We had taco and grilled onion. I was not very hungry so I had one plate of taco (3 in each plate). It seems not much but very filling. The portion was generous than other places. The el pastor was always my favorite. It is also the most inexpensive, no-frill taco in Mexican cuisine. The grilled onion was a little bit different than the one I had but it's OK. I guess we don't have that type of onion here. My husband had a rib eye taco which he loved very much. Will come back for other dishes."}
{"text":"Taco spot in Chinatown? AMAZING. The tacos were fresh, service was awesome, appetizers were delicious. If you're in Montreal, this is a must-eat-at place!"}
{"text":"Mexican-restaurant-on-the-edge-of-Chinatown is this place's theme, if it had a theme. Tacos served on Chinese-inspired plateware.  The tacos are really good (including vegan options!), although the service can be a bit bogged down with over-crowdedness. If there's a wait to get in, it will move quickly. Definitely worth the wait and the mild inconvenience of slow service."}
{"text":"2.5 *  I really enjoyed my experience here last time so I was excited to come back. This time, everything kind of fell short.  I ate here with 3 people who had never tried the restaurant. We came on a weeknight and waited a few minutes and to be seated. Nobody brought us menus or water for a while and when the waiter did come, he looked rather flustered.   We ordered a variety of tacos and quesadillas and it didn't take too long for them to come.  I ordered a large guac (for 7$ which is a little much) that comes with chips which took a loooong time to arrive. After the waiter brought our meals, I didn't see him for a while. The food looked good but mine was cold. I found the quesadilla needed some spice but couldn't find him to ask for hot sauce. By the time he did show up, I was almost done my meal. The guac and chips were good. Unfortunately the first round of chips were finished quickly and there were no waiters around to ask for more. In general, service was very slow.  Honestly, I was really disappointed with the service tonight.  I don't think this is a usual thing at this restaurant though because the waiter told us the guac was on the house and apologized for the wait without me mentioning anything to him. Though that was appreciated, I'm hesitant to say I'll be back."}
{"text":"All I can say is best food and tacos you will ever eat especially the carne asada tacos."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here last minute at 11:30pm. The restaurant was empty and we thought maybe they were closing the resto because every time I drive by there's always a crazy lineup. It being empty worked well for us because we got to pick wherever we wanted to sit and the services was super duper fast!   I ordered the habanero margarita and my boyfriend had the Jaime el Grande. Out of the two I preferred the latter. The Jaime El Grande contains Gin Two James, Lillet, jicama, cucumber, jalapeño, lime juice, and jarrito tamarindo. It was light and refreshing. The habanero margarita was not as spicy as I would have expected but at least it was strong. The orange salt around the rim tasted like a sour mango lollipop I had in Mexico recently. It definitely made the drink better. You have the option to have the margarita with just juice and ice or put the whole thing in a blender and turn it into slushie which is what I did.  If the all-inclusive bars had these kinds of drinks in Mexico I would have enjoyed it more. The margaritas I had at the resort were no good.  We started with the guacamole and frijoles refritos which is refried black beans with cheese and tortillas. I liked mixing the two. The large bowl of guacamole was really not that large. We thought they had brought us a small bowl and we asked the waitress who confirmed it really was a large bowl. It came in less than 5 min. So fast! At first I felt the guacamole had too many onions but it's just because they put tomotoes and onions on top but once you mix it its fine. I wish they had put more tomatoes though.   We ordered the Rosarito taco based on the reviews here on yelp. It was very good! The tacos were also quite large and there was three on the plate. The shrimps were beer battered and lets be real anything deep fried is delicious! In the taco there was also some red cabbage, chipotle mayo, pico de gallo and avocado sauce.   We also shared the Pirata (grilled beef quesadilla with cheese, coriander, served with garlic and jalapeno sauce). I'm used to eating soft quesadillas but this one was hard and crunchy, It was still good but just not what I expected. I preferred the taco.  We left feeling very full and satisfied. It took awhile to get our bill because it seemed the staff members were just chilling but eventually we got up to show that we wanted to pay. On the plus side, at least they were not trying to rush us out.  I would definitely come back and I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"It did not take us long to be regulars here, the tacos are the real deal! The Rib Tacos were our favourite, but you can't go wrong with any of them!   It's a great casual eatery that has that young, hip and stylish vibe.   PS- I think the other reviewers were a bit harsh with their comments in regards to the resident 'spiders'. I reaaaaallly looked and didn't notice a problem.."}
{"text":"I would say it is too pricey for the food quantity and taste. I ordered a mushroom quesadilla, it was too greasy for a quesadilla. We ordered 2 appetizers, marinated grilled french onions which was not good and the cheese fried balls was like a fried cheese cone. SURE NO!!! However my partner said the lamb tacos (specialty of the day) was very good!"}
{"text":"Uh oh. Trouble in paradise. Staff changes (kitchen and service) have waivered what I thought was an undying love for this place. I've been disappointed 3 times in a row by the quality of the food and the staff so I think this review is fair. In fact, the food and service is so consistently good when one of the owners, Paulino, is there that maybe I find out when his shift is and go back when he's working (like in totally normal, legit way; not a weird, stalker way). When the cat's away the mice will play, I guess. I'm not sure if it's just growing pains or what but it seems the newer staffers are inexperienced and really don't give a damn. My last experience at La Capital, I wanted a cocktail (something with tequila in it) but the waiter said I could have a shot of tequila and a beer - I asked for a Margarita (thinking that surely they could make a drink with lime and tequila) but the waiter said they didn't have the ingredients and offered me a grapefruit Jarritos and a tequila (maybe that's a thing? Grapefruit soda and tequila? but, NO THANKS). When I questioned not having tequila and lime in a Mexican restaurant the waiter asked me what the recipe was and that he'd make me one - yeah, A for effort there buddy but if you don't know the ingredients for a Margarita I don't want you making me one (for $10 no less). There were 3 of us dining - we had the intention of sharing the tacos but the food came out and we had no sharing plates. I requested hot sauce and the waiter pointed at the two bottles of salsa on the table (that is not what I had in mind but I let it go). My tacos had hair it in - I sent it back. HAIR. ACK! The waiter apologized and said they'd make me a new one BUT THEY LITERALLY REMOVED THE HAIR AND SENT ME BACK THE SAME PLATE... Unacceptable! Keep your hair out of my food, is that too much to ask?! Since we couldn't order cocktails we stuck to water - which was a mistake because our glasses were empty the entire time. The waiter never came back to ask us if we needed anything and we couldn't seem to flag anyone down. I also want to mention that we went at 1:30pm after the lunch rush so there is no good excuse for having trouble flagging down our waiter. Aside from our table there was a couple - that's it. It wasn't busy. We ended up eating off of the same taco plates by eating a taco and passing the plate with the remaining tacos along, which is really awkward when you are dining with co-workers. These aren't like close buddies - I think I accidentally ate something that fell out of my coworkers mouth. GROSS. I'm afraid the love affair is over. I'll probably go through a phase of eating a lot of tacos at meaningless taco joints until I find the right one and then a new love will blossom. I'm not so jaded to think that I won't find that one true taco place. The hope is alive."}
{"text":"I was hopeful that this would be a good taco joint but was sorely disappointed. Do not give this place your money. Besides the terrible service, I was given stale, rock hard tortillas that were clearly reheated for my tacos and it was disgusting. Only silver lining was that the drinks were good - but if you are looking for good service and tasty Mexican food, consider the alternatives the city has to offer. I am not a local and was here for three dinners and am heartbroken that I wasted one of my meals here given how amazing the food scene is in montreal. Steer clear."}
{"text":"I am not a Taco person but these honestly were the best Tacos I've had and it was funny that it was in Canada and in the middle of Chinatown.  Ever since coming here my boyfriend and I could not stop raving and talking about these tacos! I've told all my friends that if they ever come to Montreal this place was not to be missed.  On a Sunday the group I was with wanted to go to another location but it was closed. There were so many places closed so they asked me to search on Yelp to see where we could go. I stumbled upon this place and it was open so I told them to let's take a chance and come here.  I'm so glad that we did because everything was on point. The menu was limited they just have tacos and apps and drinks but everything was amazing that you won't care that they don't have anything else.  I've had cochinita pibil in Mexico and loved it so anytime I see it on a menu I have to order it. I got the cochinita pibil tacos which came with three tacos and my boyfriend ordered the same. It was so amazing and flavorful so much so that even though we were both full we decided to make another order to share.  It must have been really popular because the waiter told us they only had enough cochinita pibil to make two tacos so he suggested we do two cochinita pibils and one carnitas taco. We didn't care so we said sure.  Turns out there had been a mixup and another table was accidentally given our second order or tacos with cochinita pibil and we got three carnitas tacos. We weren't upset and said we would still take them but the waiter must have felt bad because he gave us all shots on the house!  Come here and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"J'adore ce resto! L'ambiance et la déco sont superbes et les tacos sont délicieux! Ils ont aussi une intéressante carte de cocktails."}
{"text":"I love the location but the beef tacos were overcooked.  Wine is warm and the prices are definitely not good. You could expect it in that part of town but in the end, it's a good 3 1/2 stars that this place deserves. Gorgeous decorum and great service. Pricey and not perfect though."}
{"text":"We strolled past this taco place walking through a street filled with Asian restaurants, which is why it caught our eye. I have string craving for Al Pastor tacos (spicy pork, pineapple) and after looking at the menu real quick to realize they served them, we walked right in. Most Mexican places serve chips and salsa, but La Capital didn't seem to as we had to order quad and chips instead. The food came out relatively quickly. The tacos tasted really good, even though I have had better. For a price of $10 CAD, you get three tacos, which is a pretty good deal, but again I have seen better. What made me sad was that there was only one tiny pineapple on each taco. The pineapple is what makes these tacos so good, but it is hard to get that taste when you only get a tiny one for each taco. Also the chips we got came in a really tiny cup, that didn't hold many chips. But, I think these were rated the best tacos in Montreal and I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Went to la Capital Tacos for lunch. It was sooo busy. Seems like it is a very popular lunch spot among office workers. I had the guacamole, fish and beef tacos, and another entree I can`t seem to remember, I only know it was hella good. At first, I thought that I would still be hungry after that, since we were 2, but I was unexpectedly full, and was struggling to finish everything.  La Capital Tacos is a great cheap option for tacos in Montreal, but please, don`t do the mistake of going there for lunch (between 11:30am and 1:30pm). Come a bit later, less people, you won`t have to wait. Also, the owner is really nice."}
{"text":"Friend and I were visiting from New Jersey, ordered the steak tacos they were just simply done but the flavor was outstanding!!!  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very few seats. Very busy. No theme. Service gets food on your plate and drinks in your hands quick - under 20 minutes. Oh, if you don't like spiders don't come. They have a one spider per light policy.  The tacos are great. The appetizers need work. The potatoes rock and so do the beets. Avoid the veggie that you don't recognize.  The after food contact is minimal."}
{"text":"Excellent food, reasonable prices and good service. Lots of different choices on the menu, lots of Mexican drinks beers, margaritas etc. Well worth a visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Update on my previous review. They now have a full selection of beers and cocktails, and the service is much much more efficient than before. I've been a couple times since the opening and its now quite stellar! Love the place."}
{"text":"Excellent little treasure in the heart of China town. We had the shrimp taco, rib eye and beef quesadilla. They were fresh and well seasoned with the sauce on the side. Also the queso was very good and the guac a pleasure. Best salad was ok not the best as the beets were soggy and not well seasoned."}
{"text":"Hands downs one of the best places for tscos!! Amazing shrimp tacos and beef quesadilla. Great food and service !!!"}
{"text":"Who would expect to find a mexican place in the middle of Chinatown? But this place is always bustling with business and has lineups even on freezing winter nights! We chose to come here early during lunch hour to try their tacos. They are definitely tasty! We had the special of the day lamb quesadillas and the ribeye tacos. Both were fantastic! Although we thought the quantity was just right for lunch, it might not be sufficient for dinner. You may want to order a few more sides to satisfy your appetite."}
{"text":"The worst service ever!! Just because i was alone, they didn't care to bring me the menu, and once she finally brought it, never came back to get the order. Shitty service, small and poorly served, to be honest you better go to a different location. I tried them before and the tortillas are cold, wet because the salsas, the meat was very plain and the salsas... well simply youtube channels give you a better recipe. Don't waste  $ in this crapy place....."}
{"text":"Great taco place! Four of us shared some guacamole, beans and grilled green onions as appetizers! We ordered the rib eye taco, carnita and the special of the day ( fried shrimp in coconut batter). The rib eye was ok, the carnita and shrimp were the stars! Awesome and original drinks and great service!"}
{"text":"La Capital deserves five stars for the food and six stars for the service.   I'll start with the food:  I started with the carrot and coconut milk soup (to my understanding it is their Thursday soup), which was some of the best carrot soup I've eaten anywhere.  I also had their special, which was a shredded pork taco trio. The flavor of the meat rivaled some tacos I've had in The Mission in San Francisco (a place known for great Mexican food). If you like spice, I also recommend asking for the 7-pepper sauce. They make it in-house and it was a great, moderately spicy complement to the pork.   They have 3 cocktails, a Paloma, a Margarita with homemade habanero syrup, and a Mezcal Old Fashioned. The old fashioned was not mind-blowing, but a very good drink that I would order again.  Finally the flan for dessert was a great little treat to end an already good meal.  Now I would also like to commend the waitress, Sandrine, for the best service I've ever received in Montreal. She took the time to describe every drink and sauce in detail, and consistently made sure that everything was to my liking. She also talked to me about the history of the restaurant, how it came to be in Chinatown, and a little bit about each of the owners. It's the little things that can make or break the experience, and Sandrine ensured that I'll be coming back to La Capital again, and next time I'll bring friends."}
{"text":"What an excellent find in the middle of china town. Just the fact that they used corn tortillias made the 5 stars. But it was not only that it was the meat the spice pretty much everything. Just great. I cant wait to bring more customers there."}
{"text":"Found this place walking by late on a Sunday night craving some taco goodness. Was open and people were seated at the counter, good hip hop blasting, welcoming smile from the service team and I grabbed a seat. Looked at Yelp for intel and went with the server recommendations  which did not disappoint. Great tacos, came out pretty quick kitchen seems on point, the peanut hot sauce was awesome and a true creeper, great flavor best of the bunch. Nacho chips were good too. Tacos in Chinatown, only in MTL. Great spot would come back if in the area."}
{"text":"Hands down \"the best tacos in Chinatown :p \". But best tacos for Montreal? I don't think so. It's not lacking of good tacos here as I think the menu is very balanced and the environment is cute & creative. However, I've had one memorable taco dish each from Escondite, la temarala (mile-end) and even cartel during its $2 taco night."}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday at around 6:30 and waited no more then 2 minutes. They gave us a place at a table of four but we were fast moves to a counter facing the window. If it's busy like on that night, expect to share the table with other patrons. It's a nice concept but not so if you're looking for something more private and romantic.  Fun cocktail menu. I chose the cocktail of the day which was a sangria. Smokey and tasty! It was good! The only bugger was that we wanted Modelo beer but they ran out so they suggested us the Corona. Here's the little problem. They're the same price (7$). Usually the Modelo is pricier.  We ordered something small to snack before our JFL show. We got the large (7$) guacamole and the small (3,50$) frijoles. They both came with house baked tortillas. They came in the same sized bowl though. Hmmm. One of our tortilla bowl was bit and pieces like if they were scrapped from the bottom of the container. Then we got the mahi-mahi taco (15$) and the \"ribaye\" taco (13$). Everything was delicious! Fresh. Tangy. Great balance of flavours. Well prepared and cooked. The tortillas were moist and had a bite to them. They also put a red salsa and green salsa, both homemade, on the table. I want to buy some of the salsas. That's how good they were!  The service was ok. Not bad nor good. We felt rushed and it kinda bothered me a bit. I mean i had just finished my last bite and they came right away to take it from us and half a minute later they asked if we wanted one or two bills.   So, so guac and frijoles. Very good tacos. Will i come back? Maybe after i try ALL the other Mexican-tacos restaurants this great city of ours has to offer! ;)"}
{"text":"que restaurante tan padre we had tacos al pastor tacos rosarito chicharrón de queso and a quesadilla de hongos which was really a sincronizada all was excellent  great ambiance and good service good mezcal the only thing i did not like was my cocktail  it was not terrible but it was not great so i moved on to straight liquor oh good music playing as well"}
{"text":"Who knew I could get great tacos in China town! Living around the corner is definitely a plus seeing how il be back from those fried shrimp tacos!"}
