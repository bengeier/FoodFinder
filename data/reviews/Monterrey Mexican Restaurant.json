{"text":"Service is decent but food is highly overpriced for what it is. Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"The food here is very typical mexican american food and definitely sub par if you fancy yourself a food lover. The prices are pretty good for the amount of food and the service was great. Warning....the chile relleno has no pepper. It was literally beef and cheese melted on a plate. WHAT? Pretty sure that's blasphemy in any mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Solid TexMex style offerings. Kids menu with American options. Reasonably priced with large portions. Servers are nice and efficient as well."}
{"text":"Nothing about the food was authentic or pallet pleasing. Chips were low end, flavorless, bordering on stale. Salsa was canned diced tomatoes with Tabasco mixed in to make it hot. Grilled chicken - dry and flavorless. Guacamole - soggy prefab mess with too many jalapeños, thus not edible. Tortillas used for enchiladas thick and rubbery. Quesadilla  - a running cheesy mess. Service was good! Very friendly - but took a long time for food to be delivered. Better off at Taco Bell....just sayin'"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Go here all the time to sit down or just pick up.  Would recommend to anyone.  Good everything and friendly, fast staff!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Charlotte area! I went on a Sunday. The downside was that there weren't lunch prices, so it was a little pricey per person. They had a $6 Tamarind margarita as the drink special. I swear this was the best margarita I have ever had (and I'm pretty picky when it comes to margaritas)! It was on the rocks, but it was smooth and the taste was incredible.   I had the Arroz Con Pollo for lunch. It was rice with their queso, chicken, grilled bell peppers and onions on top. Two warm tortillas on the side. I would absolutely recommend it! It was $12 for that meal. A little more than I wanted to pay. However, I will be back many times."}
{"text":"the new place is beautiful, but the prices went up, the food is ok, i dont like their salsa. the service was ok, a little bit of an attitude. over all its an ok place. drinks were good but overpriced."}
{"text":"Very rude!!!!  Talk about discrimination - We were in line and several Latino patrons were seated in front of us.  Finally, we were seated but only after they realized we were still there, can't help but think they didn't want our business."}
{"text":"First, let me start off by saying I NEVER write reviews on restaraunts, matter of fact, this is my first review. But you have to know that I am completely dissatisfied and quite angry with how my guests and I were treated in this restaurant. This was the crappiest meal I have ever had. The service here was terrible. AND they did not give me the correct change back after I paid. If I had thought to check my money before I left, I would have said something then but it would have taken them at least an hour to get it back to me. When I say my service was bad, I mean horrific. There were five of us total, and it was my birthday on top of that (imagine how happy I was?). We had one server, at first, who got our drink order and returned with them promptly.. after that... we barely saw our server. It took 20 min for them to come back and take our order. THEN... only 2 people got their food in an OK time frame. The rest of us waited and waited and waited while they served everyone else but us. Our server finally came back to refill our waters, but had no idea about our food. It was like he didn't care anyways. One of my guests ordered Nachos, and the chips came out cold. Another guest asked the waiter if there were any onions that came on the meal they ordered, server told her no, there were onions all over it. The only good thing I could say about this meal is about my company. Everything else sucked. Seriously never coming to this restaurant again, of I am ever near the Matthews/Charlotte area, and I will tell as many people I know how horrible the service was."}
{"text":"The Absolute Worst Mexican Eats I've ever had in my life, and I mean it.  The staff was nice and service was great. . . Chips and salsa was good too, but the entrees. . . Yucky!  We ordered chicken burrito plate and I had cheese enchilada and chicken tacos. . . Chicken was without any flavor and super chewy. . .  Side of beans tasted an the sweeter side and almost as if had a glob of lard added, absolute ewe!  The enchilada sauce a failure, no flavor just some colored stuff thrown on it. . . The whole meal tasted like we were eating plastic.  Don't be tricked my so called \"affordable prices,\". Trust me go somewhere else where u wouldn't get disappointed, Taco Bell is even way much better than this place.  It was so bad that even now when we go to a Mexican restaurant, the yucky taste of this place haunts us!  I'm sorry to write a bad review but it was really too bad of a food.  We ended up leaving the waiter a tip anyway because I didn't want to punish him for the food."}
{"text":"This particular location is my go-to place for Mexican food. I've been going to this place for years! The food is good, and the waitstaff is friendly. Rarely do they mess up an order (which is limited to the newest staff most times) and if they do, they are quick to correct it. This restaurant is my absolute fave and Azteca can't even touch it. Those who think Taco Bell is actually Mexican food will not like this place, as it is nothing like it.   I've had nearly everything on the menu and it is always good. The Chimichangas are tasty, steak is generally good, and their specialty dishes are awesome. I stay away from the shrimp as it is usually overcooked (but I'm pretty picky and won't eat seafood at a restaurant -- mostly because I can cook it better at home). Fajitas are good for a casual date. Margaritas are meh, but the Sangria is the best! Great place for lunch, a casual date, or just an inexpensive night out."}
{"text":"Coming from Santa Cruz, I was sorely disappointed with Monterrey. I ordered the lunch special #4 (taco, chile relleno, beans, and rice) and there was nothing special about it. The bean were mush. I've had canned beans with more texture and better flavor. The rice was salty. The chile relleno was profoundly sub-par having very little chile to it. I also couldn't tell if it had been fried or not. The sauce that went with it was okay, but not close to the chile relleno at Las Palmas in Santa Cruz. The taco looked like it needed a lot of love. The meat was oddly seasoned and had gross, mushy texture to it. The taco shell itself was probably store bought. Ick.  Overall, if I do go back I'm trying something else."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! Me and my fiancé came into Monterry's  on a Saturday at 3:30pm and we LITERALLY stood at the hostess stand waiting for anyone to help us for a good 10 minutes and NO ONE BOTHERED TO DO ANYTHING! We saw the hostess SITTING DOWN at a booth near the bar talking with someone having/attended what looked like a birthday party with little kids running around like crazy! The 1 server who seemed to be working was busy with a large party and when he did notice us said to just sit anywhere. So we did. NO ONE EVEN GREETED US! So we went and moved to the bar, NO ONE EVEN NOTICE US AGAIN! We left and will never come back to this horrible excuse for a restaurant ever again!"}
{"text":"Wow...usually I love coming here. But this was literally one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had!!!! Our waiter who looked like a manager or maybe an owner he had no name tag on so lucky for him. He was the rudest man. Walked away while we were talking to him multiple times and did not make eye contact once with any of us. He looked out the window while we were ordering. The food was ok...and it would of been really nice to have cheese dip with our nachos but while I was ordering cheese dip he walked away. Its the beginning of dinner and there is only one other booth with people in our section. I am still sitting here waiting for a refill which me or my friends have yet to have any refills or offers for refills and multiple waitresses and waiters have walked by and looked at us and kept walking. My friend was sitting here sipping ice loudly trying to get their attention. Seriously one of the worst experiences I've had in a restaurant. Expect no tip and definitely no smile from me. This place is a rude hole with a bunch of lazy people in it who obviously don't enjoy doing their jobs. Its so obvious its rude. Dont go here unless you enjoy being extra private and not bothered at all. No refills or check ins. God knows what would of happened if i ordered alcohol. Thank you Monterey for fucking up my dinner which I didn't even want to eat by the time it was brought to me!"}
{"text":"For the past 11 years we have eaten here for MANY lunches after church on Sunday, sometimes 3 or 4 times a month.  We went yesterday for the first time in about 4 months (haven't been as frequent for various reasons) and we will not go back.  They have raised their prices quite a bit and taken the kids' special off the menu for Sunday lunch.  We were the first customers yesterday and the chips were burnt.  We asked for a new basket and they were a tiny bit better.  We asked for mild salsa and it came out like tomato juice.  Usually by 11:30 on a Sunday there are quite a few customers in there but when we left at 11:45 or so we were still the only people there.  The food was not bad and I have always thought their chicken was the best around but I am so dissappointed.  We have too many other choices for Mexican to spend that kind of money when we can get the same or better for much less.  We know we can get better chips elsewhere.  I noticed the most of the staff was very different from what we have seen in years past.  Will miss the concenience but have to be wise about our spending and the value received!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, very americanized. They're very generous with the portions but no point in having so much food if it's not good. The salsa they give with the chips is the best part."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service on a Friday night. Great drink specials and everything you could want from a Mexican spot in/around Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is a VERY mediocre Mexican restaurant. The service is horrible. My girlfriend and I go once every few months in hope that the service will have improved, but we get forgotten every time we go. We have sat at our table for 15 minutes before being served on multiple occasions. The communication between host/waiters is just terrible. Not to mention the food. I would rather cook my own rice and chicken and eat at home than pay 12-13 dollars per person to eat mediocre Mexican food. You're much better off going across the street to Don Pedro."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the University City area! The food is delicious and the service is always speedy and attentive.  The prices are a little higher than expected at a family-owned Mexican restaurant. I love the Monterrey Quesadilla, which is a quesadilla with fajita fillings (steak or chicken) and queso dip drizzled throughout. This is a standard sized plate for $11.99, but you won't walk away hungry. I also ordered a cheese dip as an appetizer, and it was decently sized, but $4.99.  Their drink menu is a little deceiving, not having any prices listed. The last time I went my friend ordered an Island Margarita, which was pretty tasty and big, but after getting the bill she found out it was $12.99!   This place is still the best compared to Don Pedro, Los Arcos, and Azteca."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to grab a bite to eat or catch up with friends. The food is moderately priced and the service is great! I highly recommend the house margaritas and the pollo con queso. There's never a wait here which is great."}
{"text":"This was the WORST restaurant experience I have ever had! The queso was not warmed up, it was still lumpy with unmelted cheese. Not only did it take almost 30 minutes to get our food, but the waitress royally messed up our check. She did not charge us the lunch special prices, and when she charged us for our meals she charged the wrong amount. We spent almost 20 minutes explaining to her and the manager that her mistakes on the bill were not our problem. I was charged $20 that I never should have paid and there was no apologies from the staff for the mistake made or our inconvenience. On top of all this, the manager didn't seem bothered in the slightest bit! I will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"Overpriced, low alcohol content Margarita. Slowwww service....On a positive note though, very clean! And very nice waiters and waitresses! Seated quickly! Large good portions! Great chips!"}
{"text":"Upon visiting Monroe with family, my uncle took me out to enjoy this restaurant. Our appetizer was warm nachos with this ABSOLUTELY terrific white cheddar (i think) cheese sauce to dip. The sauce was sooo smooth and had nice chunks of onion, red and green peppers. I recommend it to all nacho lovers like myself. My Uncle and his girlfriend ordered quesadillas which they loved and apparently is their favorite regular item from the place. I ordered a taco salad which My only dislike was it was a tad messy , probably my fault. Everything was terrific and the staff was friendly. We went during lunch time so there was no crowd which made the experience that much better. Hope to enjoy this place again on my next visit :)"}
{"text":"Went about 4 oclock this this afternoon and the resturant was almost empty.  Heard about Monterrey from a group of friends who go for drink specials and had good things to say.  Food was pretty good and arrived 6 or 7 minutes after we ordered. Overall pretty good and I will come back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Monroe hands down. They have very nice staff and the food is always great. The new building is very nice. There is a lot more seating and it's always clean. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to like the old place better. This one is not enough privacy. I didn't like the way the food tasted at the new spot not sure why. I haven't been back since. Not sure if I want to it's just to open and crowded for me. I feel like people are sitting on my lap here."}
{"text":"Good sweet-tea and good food, but it's a little bit more expensive than better Mexican restaurants in the area. For me, the test of a Mexican joint is the mixed fajitas, which were nice but a few bucks more expensive than expected."}
{"text":"I have been to so many Mexican joints in Charlotte, its hard to keep track. I have been to Monterrey a few times and its a fairly decent place to get some enchiladas or munch on chips and salsa. It is definitely not one of my favorite Mexican places in Charlotte or even in the University area but if you're in the mood, give it a try. I would, however, recommend Zapata's as an alternate."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting a client.  My colleagues and I read the really great reviews on this place.  And, all I really have to say is how sorry I feel for Charlotte if this is the best Mexican food around.  The salsa tasted like shrimp cocktail sauce.  The chips were stale and greasy.  The Margarita was obviously from a cheap mix and \"top shelf\" was Cuervo Gold.  Out of 4 meals, one was beef tacos that \"tasted like eating dirt\", chimichangas that were mediocre at best, combo plate was no comment, and my chili Verde was actually decent.  Avoid this place.  Do yourself a favor and eat at a crappy chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Monterrey never disappoints! The service is always quick and the staff is very attentive. Quality food, great price, great service!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Northern Calif. Have been eating Mexican food often for the last 50 years. I tried Monterrey some 8 years ago when I was new to Charlotte. Not impressed enough to go back.  Couple days ago my wife and I are shopping near Monterrey and thought we would give it another try for lunch. Big mistake. Chicken burrito should have some chicken in it. I called the waiter over and he agreed it did not have much chicken in the burrito. He made no other comment and walked away.  I swear there was less than an ounce of meat in that burrito. Was suppose to have beans in it also. I don't think some watered down re fried bean dip qualifies as beans. I'm sure they could care less that they will never see me again as I am not a regular customer. Interestingly my wife's quesadilla did have a good amount of grilled chicken. Too bad the favor was uneventful. Thankfully there is one very good mexican restaurant within 15 miles of my house. It is family owned non chain restaurant. Often have to wait to get inside. Look outside the city limits of Charlotte to find it. Hint head south. I don't want to mention there name while blasting another restaurant."}
{"text":"This is definitely not Mexican food. Or at least not the kind I'm used to...which is good Mexican food. I have tried 4 places so far and all of them have been disgusting. None of them are true Mexican food. Either they try to put a twist of South American or El Salvadorian, etc. Anyway, I ordered my food over the phone and the lady who answered was extremely rude. I wanted to change a few thing about our order because they add sautéed onions and peppers to most of their food. What the heck kind of Mexican food is that? YUCK! I like onions and peppers but not in my tacos, burritos, etc. And who the heck puts it in a child's burrito? She was very upset that I wanted to change my order a bit. When my husband went in to pick it up she was very rude to him and asked, \"Are you the one that wants to change everything?\" First off, if you have gross food then you should at least have better customer service. Their chips were disgusting, food is over salted, retired beans were inedible! We there almost everything away. They used this gross nacho cheese sauce on my nachos. What? Not real shredded cheese? This place should not be in business. Please don't waste your time coming here as you will overpay for slop food. Since I am Mexican and can make all the food I love I will stick to that in this culinary hell. Charlotte really needs help when it comes to food."}
{"text":"If you have a big crowd this is the place to go. The wiaters are used to waiting on large parties of sorority girls (pickie eaters). At times they get a little slow but they give you the free chips to make up for it.  Pollo Fundido, taco salad, sopa de pollo, chicken taco, and the cheese sauce are great choices! You won't go home hungry, you could probably eat for a few days if you take home left overs.  I used to eat here every Sunday, but I moved due to work. If you are in the area and want a great deal on a lot of good food, this is the place to go.  The sangria and Margs are pretty delicious, ask for Sonja to make them!"}
{"text":"Deserves  0 stars,  order  took 45min then  came out incorrect  and burt.   Did not get the drinks we ordered  only water.   When I  asked to talk to the manager,  who was a blubbering idiot he just  shook his head and said he's  been  here  25 years.... So what  he screwed  up.   Then offered me no solution  and charged the higher  price  for  the  meal I didn't  even  order and couldn't  eat.   $38 for a taco and water. Do not eat here!"}
{"text":"The food here is always amazing. I always ask to be sat in David's section because he gives the best service and he remembers my special request even when I forget to ask for it. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for the price. If you looking for large portions for affordable rate then Monterrey is the place. My family dined for dinner and we were all satisfied with our meals. This Monterrey is not like the one on University as far as size. I would dine again."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot back in my college days but the place seems to really have gone down hill both with the quality of service and the food. The food we had just had no flavor to it hardly, it's kind of expensive to comparable other Mexican restaurants in the area too. The one thing that bothered me when we were there was that there were ants on our table that we had to keep killing so not sure where they were coming from, but it just left a bad experience because it makes you wonder how sanitary the kitchen is behind the scenes. What used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant has now become my least. Definitely won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We had not eaten here for a very long time, and then only once, so we decided to try it for lunch in the new location.  The new restaurant is beautiful.  Our server Martin was very attentive, and service was quick.  We started with complimentary chips & two kind of salsa.  Neither were overly spicy, and both were very good! For our entrees, my husband ordered grilled chicken with veggies since he is diabetic.  That was a great choice, as it was delicious...much like fajitas without \"sizzling\".  I ordered tacos made with sliced grilled beef & cilantro (comes with onions, but I don't like onions, so asked for it without).  The plate (#29 if you're interested) came with rice & beans.  That choice also was very tasty.  We shared a large Frozen Margarita, which was wonderful, then topped off our meal with some flan.  The prices were quite reasonable, the food was great, and the service was too.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"First time at this location.  It was a Sat night and we were sat right away.  The food was very fast.  The Dos Equis pitcher was not ice cold but the food was very good.  We got the fajitas for two.  The reason for the 4 stars is the beer and we had a hair in our queso.  I would still recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered from to go before I read the reviews. I ordered the flank steak and it was the toughest and one of the most disgusting pieces of meat I have ever bit into. I also ordered the Asada tacos they were in a very close first with the Flank."}
{"text":"Monterrey's has nice and classy, Mexican themed, decor.  They are not ideal for going to watch a game as the televisions are too small.  They provide a nice patio which is optimal for nice weather.  Their service is \"hit-and-miss\" as some waiters are excellent while others are slow and rude.  They provide a very reasonably priced lunch menu that will nearly guarantee leftovers.  Their food is tasty and their margaritas follow-suit.  What keeps me coming back is their excellent salsa that is provided with their tortilla chips."}
{"text":"This place doesn't push any culinary boundaries but offers the American staples consistently well. I have been many times over the years and have never had a bad dining experience."}
{"text":"Second time here in a week. Sergio is the sweetest most friendly bartender/server I've had. He is so welcoming and made sure I was having a good time. The cheese dip and steak fajitas are so so good. Coming to eat by myself I expected to sit in silence but Sergio made the best conversation and had me laughing. I live in orlando but any time i visit charlotte I will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"This place is definitely solid and I make it a point to eat here whenever I'm in town. If you are looking for more traditional Mexican dishes, I would go somewhere else because Monterrey serves up the standard Tex-Mex favorites. Their margaritas are pretty tasty and you can get a super extra large one if you're really thirsty! Aside from that, the food is good and, more importantly, cheap...I always go for a quesadilla of some sort and I'd strongly recommend getting some queso for pre-dinner chip snacking!"}
{"text":"So good! Affordable, family friendly and delicious. Decent ambiance, service can be hit or miss. Margaritas as yummy."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. I ordered the fajitas and the food came out burnt. Everything tasted burnt. My boyfriend ordered carne asada and it was hard and tasteless. Couldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This is my favorite of the non-chain Mexican restaurants in Monroe.  I'm not generally a huge fan of NC mex (way too much weird cheese sauce thing for this westerner) but they go a little lighter on it and you get more flavor from the food. The offer an actual vegetarian menu, for us dirty hippies, and a huge meat-filled menu for everyone else. Some dishes even incorporate bacon, which confused me but thrilled my partner!  Their salsa is just the right amount of flavor and heat and they keep it coming. I don't need 6 kinds, if two are delicious! I have always had good service and the manager is always friendly and welcoming.  I mentioned it was my first visit a few trips back and he offered a complimentary sample of their cheese dip, which I found to be a nice touch.    It's hard to recommend one dish because I like many but their shrimp quesadilla is a winner and I'm told their chicken with bacon (forgot the name) is FANTASTIC.  If you aren't sure what to order, get a margarita and nachos...you can't lose with that combo!"}
{"text":"I visit the Monterrey in the University about once a month during lunchtime.  People from work had always mentioned it, but from the outside, it doesn't look like much.  It's in a strip mall.  I decided to try it and once I got in there, I was amazed.  They've decorated and themed the inside of this strip mall restaurant very nicely to resemble a Mexican restaurant.  It's also divided into separate areas, making each a little more private.  I was impressed.  They bring you chips and salsa to start like any good Mexican restaurant.  They're nothing out of the ordinary, but they always taste so good to whet your appetite.  The salsa comes in a little decanter which you can then pour into your salsa bowl(s).  It's unnecessary, but the presentation of it is very nice.    The food choices are your basic Mexican menu items.  I usually get one of the lunch combos.  For about $6, you can't go wrong.  It comes with a couple of choices, rice, and a side item.  My favorite is the combo with the soft chicken taco and chile relleno (which isn't really a stuffed chile, it's more of a pile of mush of cheese and very finely chopped chile, but oh-so-good), with a \"salad\" on the side consisting of shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and guacamole.  Yum.    Like I said, the items are only about $6 a person and they really fill you up.  For a sit-down lunch restaurant, it's an awesome and delicious deal."}
{"text":"From the moment that Laura greets you at the door you know you are in for a special treat. This new restaurant takes the place of the old one across the street. Testament to the loyal customers like us who eat here several times a month! The food is fresh, Flor is our regular server, her husband is the head chef! We love all the food and will keep coming back. Mucho Gracias amigo's"}
{"text":"Having been to the Monterrey in the University area several times for lunch, we decided to give this Monterrey on Independence a try for dinner this past weekend, and we weren't disappointed.   The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, as it's in a strip mall near Outback Steakhouse.  Once you get inside, though, you can see that they took the extra effort to actually do something with their square footage.  It's not just one big room; they divided it up into sections and included high-backed booths for additional privacy during your dinner.  The Mexican decor is very fitting and creates the ambiance.    The dinner menu is a lot more extensive than lunch, but they still have combos from which you can choose.  Although instead of about 6 or 7 combos, there's about 30.  And those are just the numbered ones.  There are many, many more with names.  Ay, chihuahua!  The thing to do is, if you know what you'd like Mexican-wise, keep that in your head and look for a meal that has those combinations.  That's the quickest way to get through the menu!    I had \"La Mejor\" (translated = \"the best\").  It came with a beef soft taco, chalupa (different from Taco Bell's), and chile relleno (which isn't really a stuffed chile, it's more of a pile of mush of cheese and meat (?) on top of a tiny chile pepper, but oh-so-good).  And while the meal was good, I wouldn't call it the best.  We'll go back, but I'll try something different next time.    The chips and salsa they bring to your table are nothing out of the ordinary, but they always taste so good to whet your appetite.  The salsa comes in a little decanter which you can then pour into your salsa bowl(s).  It's unnecessary, but the presentation of it is very nice.    It's also a good place for kids and groups.  There is plenty of seating and they have a good number of choices for kids' meals."}
{"text":"3 1/2 STARS****   So my sister had informed me that this place had received pretty decent reviews on here and I thought I would try it out. So my overall consensus is that it's not as good as Azteca but its good!!   We started out with the queso that came out so quickly and was very good! I had the the Arroz Con Camerones the shrimp had good flavor as did the guacamole it came with, it was just missing something. My boyfriend had the Ribeye which came with rice and beans and grilled onions and peppers with fried potatoes and he seemed to like it.   Our server was very nice and quick!! The decor was typical for a Mexican restaurant. The location kinda sux being that far in the shopping center that many wouldn't know its there!"}
{"text":"Do not go here. Horrible non English manager will get your order wrong. When confronted all he can say is what do you want done. Basically he said if you don't like it don't come back"}
{"text":"two words for you... CHEESE DIP!  No lie, as soon as the plane lands in Charlotte I high tail it to this place. The Cheese Dip is so amazing that I dream about it when I'm in CA.  It can't be recreated and I can't find anything close to it in southern CA.   The margarita's here are also very yummy! Service is quick and prices are super reasonable (i guess anything is compared to LA)  Can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"I ate here last night for the first time for dinner. I was craving Mexican and decided I would venture away from my typical Azteca and try something new. Monterrey is tucked back in an unassuming strip mall. The inside is completely different than what you would expect on the outside. It is really nicely decorated and very \"Mexican restaurant\". We were promptly greeted with warm chips and salsa. I got the enchiladas verdes and they were pretty good. My boyfriend got the chicken and cheese (queso con pollo) and it was okay. I have definitely had better Mexican food, but this is a solid place for cheap, American-Mexican cuisine. I was disappointed that they only had chicken or ground beef tacos. I like shredded pork or beef tacos and would like to see that added to the options."}
{"text":"$$EXPENSIVE$$- Took about 5 minutes to be greeted by our server and take the drink order on a night that wasn't particularly busy. But other than that the food and service was good. HOWEVER, THIS PLACE IS VERY EXPENSIVE, $30 FOR 2 PEOPLE TO EAT DINNER!  Yelp should adjust the price rating from $ to $$."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has such a high rating. Food was not great. Guacamole and salsa were not fresh or homemade, tastes like something you can get at the store.  Enchiladas were just ok nothing special. Not sure we would go back."}
{"text":"I usually go to Monterrey around lunchtime. Sitting outside in the nice cool breeze, drinking a refreshingly large Margarita out of one of their fishbowl-sized glasses, is usually the setting for my visits to this Mexican eatery. Rarely do I go for the festive \"Mexi-Charlotte nightlife\". I decided to try out their dinner-time demeanor. Granted it was during Cinco de Mayo (which ponders a question....Do yo think Mexico celebrates Fourth of July with fireworks and Jack & Cokes or Vodka & Redbulls?....Anyways...) so I kept that in mind when formulating my review here.      I believe the food at Monterrey to be some of the best bang for your buck when it comes to Mexican food. I have eaten similar items prepared IN Mexico and it is quite comparable. They started us out with chips and salsa (probably one of my favorites) and drinks (for Cinco de Drinko, I went with a house Margarita out of a red Solo cup). Atmosphere was enjoyable and festive with a live DJ for this auspicious Mexican occasion, everyone seemed to be having a good time. That is, until the food came.      Luckily for this Ginger getting his Mexican on, his order was accurate. The same can't be said about other folks in the group. Some getting guacamole when they opted out, others glaring at the ones who got it in envy. Then when asked for refills on chips and salsa, our table watched in horror as they picked up a mini-carafe and bowl of chips from a table that had just cleared. We politely, but sternly, declined the gently used basket of chips and salsa. What was going on?      I generally rate Monterrey 4-5 stars in my books, albeit Cinco de Mayo, some qualities you just don't sacrifice. It seemed the service and quality was sacrificed that night a bit amidst the festivities. I will go back there, but I believe it will be for my Enchiladas and Fishbowl Margaritas from here on out."}
{"text":"I see other reviews say it's not authentic.  What?  Huh?  Whatever.  I thought the Salsa was awesome.  Had a great Fajita-like dish with Steak and Shrimp.  It was everything I hoped it could be and more.  So, let's see: Great Food Great Service Good Atmosphere (quietish, which is preferred to crazy) I am looking forward to a return trip soon!"}
{"text":"I placed a to go order at 9:48pm and the employee on the phone said it would only take about 10 minutes for it to be ready. I ordered the UNCC special, nothing too fancy just chicken and rice with  queso on top but I had asked for no queso. I arrived at 10:15pm expected my food to be ready and the cashier told me it would be another 15 minutes. No big deal so I waited. I ended up waiting 45 minutes to an hour. When I asked to speak to the manager the employee said that it would be a waste of time and to just talk to a waitress instead. I talked to maybe 5 different people and no one had a clue what was going on. When I finally got my food of course there was queso all over it which is the one thing I asked not to have! I am not impressed at all with the portion of food I received and it looks like complete shit. I wouldn't waste your time spending your money at this restaurant.  I understand it is cinco de mayo and of course they would be busy but it doesn't excuse the fact that they messed up my simple to go order that I placed so late in the night anyway."}
{"text":"I would say this is just your typical Mexican restaurant..nothing too special. I tried a cheese enchilada and pico de gallo. They were both ok. Prices are pretty reasonable, service is good, and the drinks are awesome. I would go for the drinks alone :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving Monterrey a 3 not for what it was in my dining experience but what I think it could be under the right circumstances. The decor is standard Mexican restaurant look. The service was very fast. I ordered steak fajitas and had the chips and salsa that come with every meal. Overall my meal was very average. Maybe a little below average. I'd probably give it a 2 or 2.5 for what I had. My server was very attentive and the food came out fast though. The main reason I have no reasons giving the place a solid 3 is because I think it could be better than my experience. They have plenty of authentic Mexican dishes which you don't normally see outside of Cali. Normally, I would have gotten one of these but was feeling like Fajitas. Also, they have a nice outdoor patio which I think would be very nice for a cool summer night meal."}
{"text":"We've come once before and the same identical dish was drastically different. The chicken was our medium steak was week done with minimum seasoning. Shrimp was over cooked, and one of my parties' steak tasted spoiled."}
{"text":"I just had lunch here with a friend from school and the carnitas was perfect. I also ordered the lime frozen margarita and it was huge, also tasted great! The server was professional and friendly, a great guy. Great meal all in all. I will be a regular customer."}
{"text":"This is your typical mexican restaurant. Good food and atmosphere. It's easy to get to and easy to find. The prices are low and the food is plentiful."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant of all times;  from Cali to Texas and back home to NC, this place is still my favorite.   The cheese dip is one-of-a-kind & the special nachos (I prefer chicken) are a meal all by themselves.  Service is normally good, but peak times, like any place, can be a little slow.  I prefer this location but the University is good too (and bigger)."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best mexican food I've had here in NC (normally from MI). Service is always quick, staff is friendly, and food is delicious! Been here multiple times and will continue to return !"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in University area.  Really enjoy the atmosphere and staff. Occasionally has live music.  I've never been disappointed with a meal I've had. Take out option is  always really good too. Food is ready fast!"}
{"text":"The service was very good. We did have a good waiter but the food was not that great. Chips and tortillas did seem homemade and salsa was plain tasting. The arroz con pollo wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Monterrey restaurant is adequate  mexican food it is a step up from taco bell. I ordered guacamole when it came it was lime green and looked like baby food the taste was ok but definitely out of a jar not fresh and it was $5. For the main entree I ordered a taco salad with beef and a side of rice when it came the taco Bowl was barely half. There was 1/4 Cup of meat which was greasy and flavorless the rest was lettuce a sprinkle of cheese and a half a tomato slice. The plate of rice looked good but another let down,  it tasted like plain rice I don't know if they are afraid to use seasoning here or what but every is bland and not spanish taste at all. My mom got tacos with rice and beans she thought it was ok but my dad said Taco Bell is better. One thing I know for sure Azteca right across the parking lot is 100% better fresh and delicious! The service was ok they were attentive but there were only a few tables. Do yourself a favor and skip Monterrey unsatisfactory food. Go to Azteca!!"}
{"text":"Monterreys is a great local Mexican Restaurant Chain. Please visit their fan site for all their locations and menu items.  http://eatmonterreys.com."}
{"text":"Decent cheap and quick. Lots of options and big servings. Good quick go to spot. Definitely a chain restaurant but is good and consistent."}
{"text":"This is our go to Mexican restaurant. It's kind of expensive but they have a few options that are cheap. They have maragarita specials pretty frequently. You can get a couple margs and a meal for less than $15."}
{"text":"I will begin this review by saying I bought my first condo based on it's close proximity to this particular Monterrey's.  I'm not sure if that's sad or a good move on my part.  The old school Charlotteans will remember this as the former site of the famous (in my heart at least) Rainbow Deli.  Monterrey has done a great job over the last seven or so years making this reborn location a fun hangout with unbeatable service and food that I constantly crave.  It's not often I take my little \"Mini-Me\" out in the evenings- At the end of the day, I'm not mentally prepared for toddler-sized meltdowns before the food arrives.  Monterrey is always the exception to this rule.  Our plates come out so darn quickly, and in the meantime, there are several waiters to come by and make funny faces at her to pass the time!  Although I haven't lived in the area for several years, they still know me by name and I'm treated like family as soon as I walk in.  I used to think I was just special, but I've heard several people with the same experience.  I've had almost everything on the menu, but the Cheese Steak Burrito is my \"Old Faithful.\"  Their Sangria is pretty remarkable and the margaritas are decent.  The best part:  The Dos Equis drafts are so cold, the ice particles form on the outside of the glass- Delightful.  My absolute favorite is meeting friends on their substantial, covered deck with some cheese dip and cold beers.  I've had birthday parties here, bridal showers, etc. and they are completely hospitable to everything.    Five stars for great food, even better service, cold beverages, and both kid and adult friendly!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte! Their \"gringo dip\" is delicious. I wish they had more than seven or eight vegetarian options- but they're all good. Their spinach and cheese quesadillas are excellent."}
{"text":"mmm mexican... I've been at this location a few times and I try different items instead of getting the \"same old same old\".  Taco Salad - yum Nachos - hell yeah! Sunday, I tried the Fajita Nachos. A mixture of grilled peppers, onions, and grilled steak along with lettuce, guac & sour cream smothering a bed of nacho chips with refried beans and queso... AWESOME!  My wife had some shrimp entree, the shrimp were decent sized and full of flavor... not too spicy but enough to give it a little kick. My nachos were $9.95 and Erin's spicy shrimp dinner was $12.95  Overall, it's pretty much like most mexican restaurants, a large lunch menu, daily drink specials, dimly illuminated, bad carpet, a small bar, and moderately priced. I think it's definitely worth trying if you're in the area."}
{"text":"First of all - They only allow 2 basket of chips definitely not what I am looking for when I go out for mexican food.   The waitress that we had either was new or was not trained well because she kept forgetting everything. I asked her about an item on the menu and she didn't know so I asked her to find out exactly what it was. She comes back 15 mins later and she forgot that I had asked her a question.   If you are looking for good mexican food don't go to Monterrey there are better places out there."}
{"text":"Matia (Not sure about spelling) was an amazing server just to start off. Very friendly. Very attentive. And gave excellent suggestions. We come here every couple months and the food is always great. The margaritas are always delicious. But this visit it was the service that really made for an all around 5 star experience. We will definitely be back, and we will definitely ask for Matia as our server again."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much from a strip mall Mexican restaurant, but wow was I surprised. The chips and salsa was average. Where I thought this place shined was the entree. I had a vegetarian burrito with a cheese sauce on it and it was hands down one of the best burritos I've ever tasted. This was one of the first Mexican restaurants that had a separate section for vegetarian options (8 of them plus a few others throughout the menu). The service was friendly and quick. My girlfriend and I both had a margarita that was good, but not worth the $12 it cost. My girlfriend lives about 2 miles from here so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We go to Monterrey about once a week and find the atmosphere and the food charming and authentic.  Service is usually speedy at lunch and they are always there quickly with free chips and salsa. I would reccomend  Monterrey to anyone who likes reasonably priced authentic Mexican dishes!"}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant last Friday and wasn't what I expected. The service was okay. The rice tasted liked it was microwaved and the steak fajitas tasted like rubber. I ordered the regular Margarita and it tasted everything except alcohol. It wouldn't say that the restaurant sucks but I'm simply not going back."}
{"text":"Good American Mexican food.  Don't go expecting authentic Mexican.  Service is quick and precise. They carry dos Equis Amber and lager on draft!  My wife loves the different flavored margaritas.  Would always recommend this location."}
{"text":"What a great Mexican restaurant in Monroe. The interior is very upscale! We sat near the bar and had an outstanding server. A great variety of lunch specials - I chose the chicken with vegetables. Very fresh and super adorable! We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a hectic cinco de mayo. We had a long wait, but we missed our name being called, but it was cinco de mayo so we were very understanding. Okay so, outside the fact it was cinco de mayo balls to the wall busy (lol), the food was prompt and delicious. I had the pollo con queso and I loved the queso, very creamy and delicious. The salsa was hard to tell if it was store bought but it was good!!! The margaritas were wonderful and the wait staff was nice. I liked the cozy environment. The review is only missing a star because it was chilly on the night we came and we got sat in front of a door heading out to the patio so we received a cold draft at our booth. Will visit again!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could this place 0 stars I would. As a server I am very understanding of when things get busy. I however do not tolerate disrespect. Not only was our server Ivan absolutely horrible and slow but he was also extremely rude. After 20 minutes I finally was able to speak to a manager who was also stressed and not very professional. After waiting 45 minutes for our checks we were finally told it would be better to pay up at the front. I will be recommending that people go anywhere but here from now on. You could get better service at a McDonalds!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic if you prefer Mexican food and you are around the university area. The location makes it really convenient to stop by and have lunch with coworkers or colleagues.   The staff is really friendly but a lot of times they seem to not understand English really well. I think it's a nice touch to a Mexican restaurant and it brings a lot of authentic value.   I've always been pleased with the food I've received. My favorite dish is the Chicken Ranchero. You get a steaming dish with chicken and bacon covered in generous amount of melted cheese and mushrooms. Alongside it you get another plate with rice and what is suppose to be a salad. It's just some lettuce with a tablespoon of guacamole sauce on it. I would recommend the dish to anyone.   The outdoor seating is also very nice and quite especially during the day. It could make for a romantic lunch date.   Prices are very reasonable, you get really generous amounts of food. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the water. Last time I had water it tasted like it was tap water and had a very distinct taste of chlorine.   This place is great regardless the minor incidences. You should definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"What a great place to have an awesome meal! The atmosphere is a bit dated yet the food has been consistently amazing as has the staff! Affordable, fresh and generous portions. I am happy to have found this gem right in my backyard."}
{"text":"I've been to other Monterrey locations and they've all been great. I figured this location will be the same- I was wrong. My boyfriend and I went around 2 on a Sunday and it was pretty busy. Chips, salsa and drinks came quickly. We put in our order and figured it would take about 15-20 minutes due to the amount of tables they had- wrong again. The server came out with my boyfriends tortillas ONLY after waiting 20 minutes. We figured our food would quickly follow. Waited another 15 minutes and the food finally came out. We asked the server if he would reheat the tortillas since it's been sitting there for 15 minutes, he said he couldn't and didn't bother to bring out new ones. Food was simply OK. Halfway through my burrito, i noticed my meat was raw. I told the server it was raw and I didn't want anymore. He said ok and that was that. We waited 35 minutes for our food and it was definitely not worth it. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is awful. I ordered a burrito, it came with ground beed. WTF??? I've never in my life seen a burrito with ground beef, and their \"red sauce\" tasted like spaghetti sauce. Such a let down to Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Had a great meal, a couple of good margaritas and good service. Stopped here while on business and it was within an hour of them closing. You'd never know it! They catered to us as if they had just opened. The fajitas were excellent! Had house margaritas and they were good and affordable. Really enjoyed this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great price, super filling. The steak tacos (tacos de asada) were the best ones I ever had, paired with rice, beans and Pico de gallo."}
{"text":"I'm thinking more of a 3.5 for this place. Let's start with a negative, the parking is usually a nightmare. The narrow strip of parking spots doesn't accommodate everybody when it's a Friday night. I actually tried eating here this past Friday but we couldn't find a parking spot anywhere, so we left.  Luckily for them I've eaten here many times so I will return! The food is good, and all at a very reasonable cost. Queso dip is always a great way to start, along with the margaritas. Both always tasty and delightful! Strawberry frozen is my recommendation :) The food has usually been good for me and the waitstaff is always pretty quick with service. I usually get chicken quesadilla with queso cheese, yum! When I order take out, they always pack plenty of rice. If you're craving Mexican, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"I came here to check out a New Mexican spot I was seated quickly but it took a while for the server to take my order. I ordered the supreme nacho special and made it vegetarian by taking off the chorizo. I thought it came with refried beans but it came with black beans instead I asked my server kindly if she could put refried beans on top of my nachos she acted like she didn't understand and for what I presumed was the manager I apologized about misreading the menu asked him the same thing he had an un pleasant demeanor the server brought out the refried beans the server never checked back on me during my meal the nachos were good but the service was poor. And on top of all that they rang me up for the wrong price..."}
{"text":"This is a tired out restaurant... dark interior and blah food."}
{"text":"The hostesses are rude and clueless. I had a party of two and waited 45 minutes while larger groups that arrived after I did were seated first. The hostess never asked for my name and crossed my name off of the waiting list even though I hadn't been seated. Portion sizes of some entrees are laughable...you have to order the right thing to feel like you received enough food for your money. The service itself is decent but you can tell that the staff are stretched thin and overworked. They don't often return to check on you after the food is delivered and refills are few and far between."}
{"text":"This was one of the WORST experiences my friends and I have had.  We were seated quickly upon arrival, but the service sucked.  We waited 15 or so minutes for a drink order and another 30 minutes on our food. Not only did I not have anything to drink (because the staff never returned to refill my glass the entire meal), but my friend had to place his glass on the end of the table because he never received a refill.  Upon payment the server took our cards, walked to the back, and walked around serving the rest of his tables while leaving or cards unattended.  The only excuse the manager could offer was that \"it's been a bad day for him and that they were short staffed so I needed to understand that\".  None of the other staff was friendly, either, except the hostess.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  There is no comparison to their Sister property in Pineville.  The food here is always piping hot and service is attentive, quick and friendly.  Cheese dip and spinach and cheese quesadillas are my favorite.  Awesome joint!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Not bad but not great. Always have to judge a Mexican restaurant by there salsa and enchiladas.. Both were meh+"}
{"text":"Mexican food is my weekly, sometimes twice a week go-to dinner when I travel for work. Although the staff was very nice, they seemed hurried and frazzled. We ordered the double shrimp fajitas. The minimal (for two) shrimp were parboiled and sitting on top of overly abundant, over cooked and tasteless green and red peppers and onion. Even though the traditional plate came sizzling, the over all impression is bleh; no flavor AT ALL. Chips were stale, salsa came right out of a can, beans and rice.... bleh."}
{"text":"This is typical Mexican fair. The salsa isn't my favorite it is more tomatoey than I prefer. The service was fine except for when they came and gave my husband someone else's quesadilla. He had bit into it already and then realized it wasn't his. The one he was given by mistake was shrimp and he told the server he would just eat it, no big deal and the server told him if he did, he would have to charge him extra because it was shrimp. I thought this odd, because, wouldn't they be throwing it away anyways? It was all a bit sketchy and left me with a weird feeling. I had the veggie quesadilla with chicken in it. It was ok. Nothing spectacular to separate it from the competition."}
{"text":"Well, I have been here twice.  The first time was delicious, and we were sooooo excited to go back and get the same exact thing.  (Mixed Fajitas with chicken, beef, shrimp, carnitas and chorizo).  The first time everything was delicious ,and the carnitas were to die for!  It was my favorite thing and I honestly couldn't stop eating it.  The second time, we were served some strange cut of pork that honestly made my stomach turn.  It was very fatty and honestly tasted spoiled.  We mentioned it to our server, stating how it was very different our first experience, and she just looked rather confused.  We both got sick to our stomachs and could not finish our meal.  And honestly, I couldn't fathom eating Mexican again for a few weeks, when it's my favorite kind of food!  The portions are huge and prices are fair there, but this meal ruined it for me.  Maybe just a bad experience, but we won't be back.  :("}
{"text":"I love this branch of Monterrey. I've been three times, and I've had fun every time. It's a place we like to go on dates, as it's cheap and you get a lot of food, and the decor is kind of nice. Two of the times we've been, we sat outside and enjoyed the breeze while we sipped margaritas.   There's about a billion vegetarian options, which always works for me. I see Kelly C. didn't like her chile relieno, but I've always liked mine. I have a friend who lived in Texas for a while, so now she is kind of ruined for NC Mexican food...I've not gotten my taste buds retrained, however, so I am still a fan.  The patio is gorgeous, the staff is friendly and quick, and the food is good. I would recommend it to anyone, especially for dating!  It's easy to miss as you're coming down Harris, so make sure you get the directions straight if you don't know where you're going."}
{"text":"It used to be good, but recently has gone downhill.  The chicken is dry, the bathrooms are always filthy, and the drinks are watery. The service is usually decent, but the past two times I've gone I've had to send back food (chicken quesadilla, both times) because it was something that resembled jerky."}
{"text":"Been looking for good \"hole in the wall\" Mexican in Charlotte for over a year, glad I finally found this place. The salsa, queso, and chimi are all very good, much better than Azteca!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I visit for lunch all the time. Fast service, friendly staff, good food! However, visited at dinner for my son's birthday, and was not as impressed. Slow service, wrong meal brought out to my husband, waited forever for the meal to be replaced. Overall, great for a fast, filling lunch."}
{"text":"This was one of the very first places that I was introduced to upon moving to Charlotte, and it quickly became a staple in my life. There are so many great memories tied to this place and gotta love mariachi night! Yeah, the parking lot stinks, but why does it matter where you park once you get inside and get filled with delicious chips, salsa, queso, and, my personal favorite, pollo fundido. So much food for your money, and great, personable service too."}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican fare. Service was a little inattentive but generally ok. Had no problems communicating with the staff as noted by others. I loved their decor, especially the large booth we were seated in.   I had the Fajitas Texicana or something of that nature and the Caso Con Pollo. Both were flavorful and the chicken elements of the dishes were moist and tender. Portions were very adequate also.   What I'd like to see improved is the cleanliness  of their restrooms. It was horrible. A food establishment should police their restrooms like hawks.   I'd return if I was ever in the area again. It's definitely a solid 7 out of 10."}
{"text":"If you can get past the sometimes not too great service, the food is awesome. Drinks are great too. Especially the frozen daiquiris. Could definitely have better drink specials throughout the week. I really love the taco salads.   Only complaint of all of my multiple visits: Rushed us out on my birthday. Made us feel like we had overstayed our welcome. I'm a bartender and always tip based on time spent as well so I didn't appreciate feeling like I was being pushed out of the door."}
{"text":"Add this place to the list of Mexican restaurants that have the exact same menu and a staff of barely intelligible people that don't give an eff about you or the quality of your food.  Chips and salsa: chips were burned and gross Chicken fajitas: six pieces of tiny chicken and a sizzling plate of under cooked vegetables Ordered kids chicken soft taco: she brought beef Pointed out to server taco was beef not chicken: smiled at me clearly not understanding a word Server returns with replacement taco: beef again (this actually happens twice before we he"}
{"text":"All I wanted was for the hostess to tell someone behind the bar (or elsewhere) to bring me the drink I had ordered 35 minutes earlier (QUIETLY!) so that our waiter did not know what was going on (he was new) I didn't want to make him feel bad or get him in trouble.. Instead a BIG deal was made and she alerted the manager and discuss the entire situation right in front of him (Our Waiter!) trying to find out who our waiter was and explaining to management that I had asked! Uneccessary! The waiter had me point to what I had ordered on the menu, asked me 4 times what beer I wanted to drink, asked about our daughter's drink twice, took a plate from the table that we told him we were still using and still 35 minutes later the beer never arrived at the table!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Mexican food around the university. Their prices are pretty good and the food has always been spot on. Haven't had the chance to try any drink specials but I heard those are good as well."}
{"text":"The new Monterey Restaurant is fabulous. My wife and I both enjoyed our server, the atmosphere, the drinks and food. We will be returning often."}
{"text":"Excellence food and service! Better fish tacos than we had in Mexico! Authentic! Highly recommend Monterrey."}
{"text":"Yeah, this isn't really authentic Mexican food, but they do have good specials for lunch.  You can come out of here for about six or seven dollars, and it is much better quality than fast food.  As far as Mexican goes though, it really doesn't stand the test.  It is hard to find any good food besides the average chains around this area though.  Just go off of Central Ave. to grab some Mexican food."}
{"text":"Another chain of Mexican restaurants and this one is specifically located near my house so I've been a few times.  Food is a-ok and the drinks are pretty standard of most Mexican joints with your typical selection of beers and large margaritas.  I always am amazed at how quick the dishes come out but I still haven't figured out why my plate needs to be 100 degrees if I ordered a taco salad? Either way, if you are looking for a quick bite that won't break the wallet, then this place will fit the bill."}
{"text":"Yesterday my friends and I decided to go to Monterrey's to have Mexican food. Our experience was THE WORST. Our server Jose had an awful attitude from the beginning. When my friend asked about a la carte items he seemed very bothered and told her that they no longer served separate items so she had to get a meal that she could barely finish. When our food arrived he mixed up dishes while slamming the plates on the table and then having us switch hot dishes around the table. At one point we ran out of water and I personally had to get up from the table and ask him if he could bring us water (he was too busy speaking to his coworkers to worry about his tables). Moving on, the food was not that great I was very underwhelmed with the presentation. The queso i ordered was runny and other people's plate on the table were looking unappetizing as well. My boyfriend has a quesadilla that wasn't even cut and maybe we are expecting too much that this restaurant can't provide but every mexican restaurant we've been too anytime we order quesadillas they are usually cut into triangles. My boyfriend ended up getting food poisoning and threw up the whole night. If I'm craving Mexican this will be the last place I go. Worst food and service I've ever received at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a while and decided I wanted Taco Tuesday! Going to Monterrey was a good choice, the tacos were fresh full of flavor and they were prepared perfectly! I had the chicken and the steak! I wish they would allow you to try all 4 chicken, steak, chorizo, and carnitas. For some reason you're only allowed 2, regardless they were good as were the enchiladas verde! Keep up the good work Monterrey!"}
{"text":"Service was great once we got seated. Our waitress was awesome! Only problem I had was with Alexis, the hostess, we walked in and she looked at us and didn't acknowledge us. Then 2 more couples came in after us and she got to them right away and gave them a beeper. Very disappointed in how she treated us!"}
{"text":"Very good choice for dinner tonight. Great service and great food.    The margarita double was the right size and strength.   Wife had the a screw driver and was happy.   The nachos were a very good choice for a light dinner.   We're happy or tipsy. Either way we will come back."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for fast Mexican food make you're way here. Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I have been going to Monterrey since they opened nearly 20 yrs ago. The food is excellent. My favorite is the chimichangas both chicken and shredded beef but I have tried nearly everything and its all good. Love the fajitas, beef or chicken (skip the shrimp), tacos de asada, pollo con crema, pollo con queso, as well as any of their combinations. Oh, and you can't go wrong with just a couple chicken soft tacos ala cart, they are delicious. For those who have complained that it's not authentic Mexican food - your point is? I have been to at least 20 Mexican restaurants in Charlotte including many \"authentic\" ones where they don't even have an English menu. I like some of the food at these places but always come back to Monterrey."}
{"text":"This place has REALLY gone down hill as of late. It used to be semi-decent. Tonight's visit was a nightmare. Took the whole family there. Typical last minute decision, tired kids, grumpy spouse. The chips were stale and over cooked, or double cooked. The wife got the giant margarita. It was so syrupy tasting that she couldn't get more than two sips out of it. At the end of the meal I took it back to the bar and told the manager it was totally awful. He didn't understand my English so the rest of the conversation had to take place in Spanish. He did offer to put more booze in it, but the taste was the part she couldn't stand. I asked him how they made it, he pointed to the uniform shape and size row of bottles and said, \"just this mix and tequila\". No limes, no fresh ingredients. There was nothing that could come from that bar that would have sufficed. It was just bad.   I got the burritos verdes. They are a new item, beef tips in a burrito. Not awful really. But the burrito was mostly beans, with just a hint of beef in it. Wife got the fish tacos. They were too salty for her (or anyone) to finish, so I swapped meals with her and poured hot salsa all over them and just ate em down. They were NOT good. The \"special sauce\" that they serve with the fish tacos ended up just being generic thousand island dressing. I took a bite of some of the kids meals too. The burrito meat my toddler was pushing away all night had the texture of wet sand. It was so overly salty as to be almost inedible and the taste was horrendous.   The service was pretty lame too. One waiter came bringing four plates and after about five minutes of trying to decide who's was who's we finally had to explain to him that none of these orders were ours and he was at the wrong table. So he takes 3 of the 4 plates away and leaves the 4th one for about 10-15 minutes while the customer who ordered it waited confused. It was really slow in there too, maybe 6 other people in the whole restaurant.  The manager walked by the table about a half dozen times never stopping to check on us, and I don't think our drinks were refilled the whole night. We didn't bother to complain  because it was already a bit of a rough night for us and we just didn't need the drama. So in all fairness, I didn't really give them much of a chance to redeem themselves. But honestly, if EVERYTHING that you send from the kitchen to the house comes out bad, service, entrees, drinks, chips, booze I don't think a polite complaint could have done us any good.  If you're a college student at the nearby UNCC and want a hole in the wall to drink beer at while watching t.v. or chatting it up on the patio with friends, this place will work. For the rest of you diners out there, skip this place and save your money. It's not as bad as it used to be, its worse!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about but if you feel the need to go then it's there so go.  Service was attentive and they tried.  I entered ready to order the chilaquiles that came up via several online searches. Well, they offer shredded chicken or ground beef for their chilaquiles and this is not anything I'm accustomed to.   I asked for steak. The server tried and came back with beef tips as a counter. I took the shredded chicken. Mind you I arrived right after opening and only 2 cars in the lot. Even if they needed to upcharge to give me a piece of flat steak then I'd take it. The chillaquiles comes with rice and refired beans. Remember I came about 11:40a and they open at 11a? Well, I didn't get fresh rice but rice from last night or two days ago. There were older dark pieces, crunchy pieces and the beans were okay. The verde sauce on the chilaquiles was perfect but the chicken just made it okay.   They serve salsa in a carafe and you pour it into a bowl but the server's assistant had his hand all in the bowl so I opted out.  All in all it's the usually gringo tex-mex and I love such.   I'd return if over that way but I'm not making a special trip. I can also understand how folks feel the chips are stale but again....  that didn't make me score anything lower.   There's room for improvement but you won't die here."}
{"text":"Awesome.  the food is delicious.  The staff is so courteous and friendly.  We dance Salsa...as we ate."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place is our go-to for Mexican food! The service is always so friendly. The chips and salsa they give you are always fresh; the chips are still warm and the salsa has just the right texture and kick. I've tried a few things on the menu from salads, to tacos, and burritos, and pollo con queso. Everything is good with lots of flavor. The pollo con queso is my favorite dish! It is literally chicken with cheese. The chicken is cooked to perfection and is served covered in this amazing melted cheese sauce, along with a side of refried beans and rice. I could eat this dish every night! Pair it with one of their margaritas (I love the mango one), and it is American-Mexican perfection!"}
{"text":"Quick and fast... great for lunch!  This place is located off of Harris, but a little hard to spot if you aren't looking for it.  The parking lot can be a bit of a krap shoot since it is located on the end and everyone seems to try to take the spots closest to the door.  Has great lunch specials and it is super fast (so you can enjoy your lunch without having to watch the clock too much).  Chips and salsa were kept on the table - The salsa has a medium kick to it (just right) and I can pretty much down a whole basket of chips myself (SAD, but true).  From Harris, the place doesn't look that big, but it really opens up inside and they have some pretty wicked decor inside.... some of the booths have a false thatched covering over them and the decor always seems festive."}
{"text":"Terrible. Will never eat there again. Good food. They pretty much threw the food at us he served it"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here.  Food was great!  The pitcher of frozen margaritas was amazing and the deserts didn't disappoint.  My waiter was attentive and helpful.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Stop here to grab something to and wasn't that impressed. Not as bad as Azteca but not as good as Mi Pueblo. The mild salsa looks like katchupy and the guacamole was quite Bland. My oldest daughter didn't want to take her home for leftovers. My youngest daughter however enjoyed her steak and shrimp her Mexican surf and turf. The tacos wasn't good at all I sent them back. However the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Monterrey - the regional chain - is quite possibly the first Mexican food that I ate in Charlotte.  Whether it was or not, it is the first I remember having.  I typically eat at the location in Matthews, simply because it is closer to my house.  As has been mentioned by other reviewers, this spot is a bit funky.  While you can see it from Harris, it is almost always in a \"oh, there is Monterrey\" discussion, so that you are passing by going one way or the other and it is nearly always too late to figure out just how to get into the parking lot.  Should you happen to figure it out, then the food is not bad, and pretty similar to the other location in Matthews - fairly standard, perhaps skewing to the high end, Americanized Mexican fare.  While there are better stops in Charlotte for Mexican food, there are plenty that are worse as well, so try and find your way into the parking lot and give Monterrey a try!"}
{"text":"Generally good Americanized Mexican.  The chain is a local one, so you aren't likely to find it much outside of the Charlotte area, but around town you'll find a few locations.  It's not true Mexican that you can find around town either, but it's not a bad compromise, either, and the prices are decent."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with our last visit. Food  was terrible. We ordered tortilla soup and got sour cream vomit. It was so gross and unacceptable for the price of the soup"}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location and I was overall pretty pleased. The menu is slightly different compared to the other Monterrey's I've been to in the area. We came here for lunch and service was good and quick. The salsa is good but not that spicy. My husband got the chicken fajitas and I got the speedy gonzalez. Food was flavorful and filling. I would definitely come back if I was in the area again!"}
{"text":"Horrible RESTAURANT, the staff is very rude. They are not welcoming at all. We had a reservation for a big party and they decided to kick us out last minute. I would not recommend this place to anyone. It was also very dirty with chicken under the booths. Do not come here. They should've called it la cucaracha."}
{"text":"I've been to this Monterrey location numerous times, and they consistently deliver solid Mexican food with good service. Fajitas are exceptional, and if you're REALLY hungry the \"El Combo\" meal is a pretty cheap deal for a ton of great food. Have never ordered anything from here that I didn't enjoy in 10-15 visits."}
{"text":"There is nothing better when you are hungover than a trip to Monterrey Mexican Restaurant. Chips + salsa + cheese dip = miracle cure.  In terms of the Monterreys here, I would rank this one second behind the Matthews location. I still think that one has better salsas than the others. This Monterrey does have a good sized patio, though.  Monterrey has a lunch menu that runs from 11am-3pm. They also have different specials every day. I pretty much order anything that's covered in cheese dip.... chimichangas (I recommend getting them soft instead of fried) or pollo fundido. My friend Andrea always gets fajitas. That's pretty much her go-to at every Mexican restaurant. Starter wise, you get complimentary chips and salsa. I go cheese dip over guac because I feel like their guac doesn't have that much flavor.   It by no means is the best Mexican food in Charlotte, but it's a solid option for the price. It's not fancy. You'll smell like Mexican food after you leave. It's a big hit with the college kids in the University area. The last time I was here, a party of about 30 sorority girls came in for dinner and drinks. The staff didn't miss a beat with the large group.   My only complaint about Monterrey is that there isn't a convenient location for me. I'm near uptown, so I have to drive to Matthews or Monterrey to get my fix. Monterrey, if you can hear me, feel free to build in my 'hood. And by 'hood, I mean my front yard. Hell, you can even set up shop in my garage."}
{"text":"Yes, I know it's not authentic... but this is my go to place to satisfy a craving for Mexican food.  I love the salsa. In terms of the Monterrey locations, this one has the best. For me, it's the perfect texture, flavor and heat combination. I also have to order the cheese dip every time. I'm not a huge fan of their guac. It's okay as a topping for my meal, but I would never make it a point to order a bowl for my chips.  I'm in a longstanding relationship with the chicken chimichangas... soft with rice instead of beans. You can't go wrong with anything that is drizzled in cheese. When I do cheat on the chimichangas, I go with chicken soft tacos or whatever the special is. My mom doesn't like Mexican food (I know, right? Don't even get me started on that), but she is a big fan of the taco salad.  Monterrey has decent drink specials. It's not terribly expensive to begin so don't expect to have to drop a ton of money on food and drinks.  Service is hit or miss. One constant though is that it never takes a long time for your food to come out of the kitchen.  Casual place. Nothing fancy. I like the fact that I can go in here with my pajamas on and feel like no one is judging me. What? Sometimes you get the urge for chips and salsa and don't feel like getting out of your pjs."}
{"text":"My \"go to\" Mexican restaurant. I really like the options on the menu and have yet to order something I haven't enjoyed."}
{"text":"food is very good..service is above average..price is fair also.. worth the stop if your in the area and hungry.."}
{"text":"We ventured over here since Outback next door was a nightmare.  SO GLAD WE DID.  THIS PLACE IS GOOD!  We walked next door and entered. The entrance seemed slightly seedy with tinted glass windows. It had the feeling like you were about to enter a low class titty bar.  When we got inside...it was nice and clean.  The food was EXCELLENT, FRESH, and seasoned just right.  I think we will put this place in our normal rotation of eating.   It could quite possibly be the best Mexican food ive had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for lunch today.  He ordered the Chimichanga and I ordered the Special Nachos. I asked fro fresh onions and they Game me fried onions. Maybe a communication problem. Got my Nachos and there was so much water/juice that the chips in the Nachos were soaked through. My husbands was good but mine was almost in edible. Waitress was nice but never came back to see how our food was so I didn't have an opportunity to tell her how soggy it was. I poured about 3/4?cup of water/juice off but still very wet and soggy.  Won't order those again and maybe a bad day but still not a good experience"}
{"text":"Pollo con queso is everyyyyything. To be honest it's the only thing I've ever eaten here so I can't really say much about the other food but I've never heard any complaints from people I eat with.  Service is a little iffy. Some servers are super nice and friendly and others you can just tell waiting tables is not their calling.   As far as Mexican restaurants for the university area this by far the best option."}
{"text":"I eat here quite often.  It isn't great Mexican food, but it is pretty good and the best in the neighborhood.  One plate I would like to recommend is El combo.  It comes with a LOT of food.  I usually only eat half and save the other half for lunch the next day.  It all comes with beef but you can sub chicken for any item at a cost of $0.25.  The hard taco and the Chalupa are best eaten that night.  The chili rellano could have more pepper in it.    The margaritas are hit or miss.  Sometimes they will be strong and sometimes they will be a little weak.  On Mondays medium margaritas are $5.50 and they are pretty good sized.  I think on Thursdays they have beer on special.    If it is your birthday, they let you wear a sombrero and give you a fried flour tortilla with a whip cream smiley face on it.  It may come with some syrup and a cherry too.  You do not get to keep the hat like I thought, they will chase you down and ask for it back."}
{"text":"Meh. Typical run of the mill mexican, in and out. The salsa was the best thing about dinner. This place used to be so much better, when it was a small hole in the wall across the street. Food is bland and service is below average. Decent sweet tea!"}
{"text":"I came here for margaritas a while back and I'm pretty sure they gave me a virgin one because a girl I was with didn't have an ID. I had an ID, and the drink cost $18, but I didn't even feel a buzz off a huge drink with two beers in it that I drank quickly. Instead of complaining since I drank it all I thought I would just share."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Service was very fast and we got our food in a flash. I highly recommend the queso burrito. Pretty decent meal size for the price."}
{"text":"I'm no expert in Spanish, but I've always thought \"Chile Relleno\" meant \"stuffed pepper.\" I wish I had been warned that at Monterrey it means \"pile of gravy.\" I ordered a lunch combo with chile relleno, and it was LITERALLY A PILE OF GRAVY. I pushed through it with my fork and found a square of bell pepper the size of my thumb at the bottom. It was not pretty, but tasted ok.  The taco that came with it was meh. Just some beef with little seasoning and one piece of iceberg lettuce put into a taco shell.  If you live in the area, and want some cheap-ish lunch as a hangover breakfast, this might be a fine place to go. If only there were biscuits to go with the chile relleno.  Our waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Very good food.  I enjoy the salsa.  The food came out hot and quickly, so that made me happy.  The prices are decent. Pleasant environment.  Good service.  I went on a weekend and the wait was not bad."}
{"text":"Arriba!  Good food excellent atmosphere.  I love that this place has all of the good Mexican menu standards done well; but what makes this restaurant really good is that they go the extra mile to set the scene for your meal.  The restaurant's atmosphere gives you a sense that you may have left Charlotte for just a moment.  That said, after a few of their Margahretas you might actually swear you are south of the border - and I am not talking about South Carolina!"}
{"text":"Fresh guacamole was excellent and we split the chicken fajitas. Tons of great food and prompt friendly service. A keeper for sure"}
{"text":"Walked in, saw the layout and how bright the restaurant was so we turned around and left!  Seems way too open and feels like everyone can see each other, not good if you suffer from anxiety and not the intimate setting I used to enjoy..  I felt very uncomfortable!  Went down the street to El Vallarta.."}
{"text":"Portions are small Drinks weren't really worth it Did I mention portions were small?? I'd rather go to Taco Bell"}
{"text":"One star because the service here is horrible if you don't get the young lady. I'm drawing a blank on her name, but I haven't seen her in a couple months, so who knows if she even works here anymore.  I go here because my friends and the teens I work with like this place. The food is okay-- not amazing. I like the queso dip, guacamole here is not good, so I never get it even though it comes with what I order. I usually get a chicken chimichanga because I'm not a fan of the other items. Authentic Mexican tacos have no cheese and have cilantro and onion on top-- this place serves tacos with lettuce and cheese.  There have been several times where our food has been wrong, but if you even take a bite out of the food, you'll get charged for it. If you want to switch veggies, they will, but you'll be charged to put a different veggie, but won't be refunded the one you took off. You will be nickel and dimed here.   One of the times we came in, our waiter didn't refill our drinks the entire time we were there, AND we had somewhere to be, and we waited for 40 minutes for the check. We were late to cheer practice because he was nowhere to be found. I work with special needs teens, and they love this place, but they also like bland food.... they don't want to come back because they also hate being late, and we usually wait for something every time we go (the check, refills, food takes too long, etc)."}
{"text":"I'm a big Mexican food fan! This Monterrey location in Matthews always seems to hit the spot. Stopped by recently on a Saturday evening for dinner. Got right in! I ordered the chimichangas w/ shredded beef, fried. I know, I know, they do offer an non fried option, too. Great flavors w/ the guac & sour cream & side of refried beans. Topped it off w/ an ice cold Dos Equis. Can you really ever go wrong w/ an ice cold Dos Equis? The wife tried the Taco Salad w/ chicken. I enjoyed that dish as well. Is this my go to Mexican restaurant? No, but on a Saturday night when I'm hungry and not in the mood to wait too long, this is a great option."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in University City. Great staff, quick and courteous."}
{"text":"It's exactly what you would expect from Mexican food.  No more, no less.  As far as the intangibles go, the restaurant is above average.  Clean bathroom, lots of seating, large outdoor eating area, and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Service was extremely disappointing. We got seated within a reasonable amount of time but after sitting for 10 minutes we still hadn't been visited by a waiter. I had to walk back up to the hostest stand to ask for a waiter to come to our table. Even after this the server we got was slow and didn't seem very knowledgeable.  Maybe this was a new gut but it was extremely off putting for our first trip here. As for the food, it felt like it was missing something. The cheese dip was decent but it was too runny. The chicken in my burrito wasn't seasoned very much. The cheese covering the burrito was good but it wasn't great. My fiance had fajitas and it took probably 5 mins after they dropped off the food for them to bring her tortillas. The steak I'm her fajita was also kind of bland. It wasn't bad, it just needed some spices. All in all I feel like I wasted $35 on the meal and I doubt we'll return."}
{"text":"Don't bother! Go to Taco Bell. Chili Relleno is just chopped up pieces of a pepper.  Combo does not even come with rice and beans on all options. Salsa very bland."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very friendly! I ordered los tacos de carne asada and they were fantastic. Steak on corn tortillas served with a side of cilantro, onion, lime, and traditional salsa so I could put as much as I wanted on my tacos, which was great! Everyone enjoyed their food choices, Nachos Tropicales were a hit! The cheese dip appetizer is a must. I'm always very iffy about ordering meat at a place I haven't been before, but all the meats here were perfectly seasoned and well cooked, served hot. Absolutely delicious will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is delicious, the place is clean and the service is lightning fast! I have absolutely no complaints I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant. My fiancé and I ate here for my birthday. I thought the service and the food were great! The food came out really fast and I was given a free birthday desert. I believe it was a warm fried tortilla dusted with cinnamon- sugar, with whipped cream and chocolate syrup. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Charlotte and this is hands down the best restaurant we've been to. Our server was EXCEEDINGLY amazing and overall had the best experience. I am going to today for my second day in a row. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"Sunday Mexican, yippee!  Having been to other Monterray locations, I was excited to see this location while on Independence Blvd.  Arriving just around 12, along with most of the lunch crowd we were greeted and seated in a booth near the back.  We were immediately served chips and salsa, which hit the spot, and ordered two medium margaritas.  While we looked over the menu we enjoyed the margarita, not too strong, but a nice drink to enjoy on Sunday afternoon..although I would have liked a little more kick. The chips were good, but were pretty bland, and needed a little more salt.   We ordered the Taco and Burrito combination platter and the chicken fajitas. The combination platter was a chicken burrito and ground beef taco.  The burrito was great, topped with cheese and a mild red sauce. As for the taco, the meat was a little dry.  As for the fajitas, they looked good and I was told they were delicious. Overall, the service was great, the menu full of options, but I was hoping for a little more taste from the food.  No doubt I will definitely be back to Monterray, however, I may stick to the other locations, ha ha!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant. Service is outstanding food is consistently amazing. Great atmosphere and always fresh food and drinks."}
{"text":"Another one not to come back too. I had heard that a bunch of people that had eaten here got sick, heard this from and emergency room worker. We went a few months after hearing this figuring things had gotten better,NOT. I ordered the Polo Fundido and it was absolutely gross dry and no flavor even the tea tasted sour. I only ate 2 bites of it and I was done. I did not see the grade until after I'd taken the bites of food, it was hidden in the corner in the back of the restaurant a 91%, I do not eat at places less than 96%. Later that night my husband, son and I got sick, it had to be from here because that is all we had that day. Never again will I give this place my business!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food for the price. Esteban is a very courteous waiter. The gringo dip is a frat choice for an appetizer."}
{"text":"The service is consistently slow. We ordered a simple steak quesadilla and it took 20 min to arrive. We also ordered water and it came with our meal."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to inexpensive dinner places. Their margarita's are good and very large if you get anything but the small. The food is good, I'm a fan of the La Mejor and my hubby always gets Pollo con Crema.  Take home boxes are standard for us at Monterrey having left overs for the next day.  The service can be hit of miss, but typically they are very attentive and food comes out quickly.  The dining room is a bit of a dive and sad.  The booths and tables have seen better days.  It could certainly use a face-lift."}
{"text":"I'm ashamed to admit every time I walk into Monterry's that ask me if I want a Margarita, they don't even ID me anymore. That either means I drink way too many margaritas or I'm a fan of Monterrey's.  The location isn't anything special. If you're coming from Harris Blvd. you will mostly likely miss the turn and will have to swing back around. As for Charlotte/ North Carolina chain restaurants, this Mexican joint is a personal fave.  While the food isn't authentic Mexican it will satisfy your craving.  Their queso dip and margs are pretty tasty. The menu is quite extensive- usually I just grab a taco or burrito, but they have many other options.   This location, has the best service. Everyone is always kind, attentive and speedy. I have been to other Monterrey's and this one is my favorite. They have good specials, outdoor seating and tasty Mexican... what's not to love?"}
{"text":"This is my favorite mexican restaurant in Charlotte. My wife and I eat here on a regular basis. Great food, great people, great price."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I have ate multiple times while stay in Matthews on business. Great prices and great food! Only complaint is the menu isn't like other Mexican restaurants"}
{"text":"I try to shy away from \"chain\" restaurants, but this one is exceptionally good.  I'm a sucker for Mexican food anyway - heck I used to frequent this place at least once a week.  The prices are great, usually the place is not that busy, so you get a good, hot meal without dinging the wallet (or purse) to hard.  The dining room is split up to 2 sides, I guess at one point it was smoking and non-smoking (is my best guess)... but it was always exciting to come in and figure out which side they would seat you on.  For the longest time my roommate and I kept getting seated on one side and couldn't figure out if the other side was much better.  The grass is always greener...LOL but in this case, I don't think it matters.  The chips and salsa that are offered with everything are pretty good, the salsa has a bit of a kick to it so I like it.  You can easily fill up fast on chips, so be careful."}
{"text":"Monterrey is close to UNC Charlotte and as such there is usually a college crowd when you go there.   They have a large deck/patio area that is covered. It also has fans built into the covering for those hot summer days. Great place to go if you want to sit outside while you sip on your margarita and snack on chips and salsa. They also have speakers that play music outside which is nice.   The cheese dip here is good, but it's a little bit runnier than other places that I have gone. I prefer it to be a little bit thicker so that it really sticks to the chip.   I have gotten a few different entrees here. All of them are good. It's your basic Mexican restaurant. It's nothing special or extraordinarily culinary. Food always comes out quick. The portions are big and the prices are pretty cheap. They also have lunch specials."}
{"text":"The food was good, and filling. It came out so fast.  But the waitress rushed us the whole time...  didn't even ask my son if he wanted beef or cheese enchiladas, so he ended up getting beef... but wanted cheese.  At least the food was good, even though the service wasn't."}
{"text":"Three of us had dinner there last night.  I had the grilled chicken salad.  I've had it before, and it was fairly good.  They always put mushrooms on the salad, so asked for extra mushrooms last night, and they gave me less than ever!!  One of the others ordered a California Burrito, and it was very small.  The burrito was $12.95; for that price should have filled the plate, but nowhere near that.  Also, my salad was $11.24, way overpriced for a salad.  Only about 7-8 very thin strips of chicken on the salad.  With the same money could have gone to a good buffet and had a much better meal.  Since they have moved their prices have gone out the roof.  I used to love the place before they moved, but now, I won't go back.  They think more of their food than I do.  Way overpriced for what you get."}
