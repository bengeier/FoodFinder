{"text":"Awkward! This is not a restaurant....it is a 8 seat bar 1/2 way in the common area. Tuna & salmon  was tuff & chewy. Chef watches you eat his food so I smiled as I poured soy & downed my roll with ginger."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and overall experience. It is hard to know what to expect when you arrive to a little spot with 5 seats. We did the pairing menu which was phenomenal. Everything was fresh and delicious. Don't think you can go wrong here for a casual evening of appetizers or special occasion tasting menu!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for Omakase! My hats off to the chef and his amazing selection . You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This food was absolutely horrible... honestly didn't feel like venturing out of the resort again, but my fianc√© and I were craving sushi... which we try new restaurants frequently. We ordered smoked salmon sashimi, Philadelphia roll, spicy tuna roll, and the rainbow roll. It tasted like a roll you would find at either Safeway or Jewel Osco....50 some odd dollars later for grocery store sushi... more than unimpressed..."}
{"text":"Ah-mazing! Wonderful sushi & wonderful service! Mark & Karen are so worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner here for my best friends birthday. We made reservations as this is a bar top with 6 seats. Although you can order from anywhere in the lobby area and they'll bring it to you! The sushi here was AMAZING AMAZING. So fresh! We kinda ate a little of every roll to be honest. My friend has allergies with crab and they were accommodating to her allergy. Karen was our fantastic server and Kathyrn was our cook for the night. Overall great service and quality food. I will absolutely crave the shrimp ceviche 100% will come back for that! I recommend to stop by here!"}
{"text":"Loved this place and our sushi chef Johnny. Did the seating, even though you can order sushi anywhere in the resort, but we wanted to enjoy the experience. We were actually the only people so we had a great chat with the chef and he made us whatever we wanted, even things that weren't on the menu. Great sushi, good taste and good sized pieces. Plus made sure mine was gluten free!"}
{"text":"While waiting for some friends, we ordered some edamame and spicy tuna rolls.  The edamame was tasty and steamed perfectly, while the the spicy tuna rolls were good. Great for grabbing a quick bite to eat if you're at the Hyatt."}
{"text":"If there was a way to give six stars, I would.  Noh and Chef Mark (we love you too Karen) take sushi to a whole new level.  The \"normal\" sushi is anything but that, but the tasting menu is beyond comparison.  The first thing you should know is that while sushi is served throughout the Hyatt's bar(s) and lobby, you need to sit at one of the six sushi bar seats to indulge in the tasting menu.  Note to self: call ahead and make reservations.  One course is better than the next, and the presentation, delicate flavors and sauces make it a very memorable culinary experience.  Top it off with a made to order dessert (though the liquid nitrogen to make the ice cream did scare me a bit), and before you know it, you will go from food bliss to blissful food coma.  This place is a MUST !!!"}
{"text":"Make the time...visit Noh at the Hyatt.  Sushi Chef Marc prepared the most fabulous rolls - everything we had was delicious!  He even won over my husband, who until our visit, would merely tolerate sushi.  If you're lucky, Nicole will be serving as well.  I will definitely return to Noh on my next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is nestled in the Hyatt Regency. It has six chairs for seating but don't let that fool you. You can sit in any of the restaurants and order from their menu. The sushi is very fresh and if it's not on the menu ask for it. They are very accommodating. If you love sushi this is a great place to try."}
{"text":"AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!! My wife and I did a staycation at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch for Father's Day. We tried Noh for dinner. \"Sushi Marc\" was our sushi chef...he made us some great customized rolls. My wife requested a few rolls with cucumber (versus rice) and Marc hooked us up. Cheyenne was our waitress and she did a great job of keeping the drinks flowing. My wife and I eat a lot of sushi. Our top picks locally have always been Pure Sushi and Roka Akor. We have to say that Noh is now our new favorite sushi restaurant! The whole key is Marc behind the bar making the sushi...he is amazing!! He's hilarious too...kept us entertained with stories all night. Without Marc this place would not be notable at all!! Everything was very fresh and surprisingly very affordable. Great service with INCREDIBLE sushi at a reasonable price...I would give these guys 10 stars if I could! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Live music is great, service is friendly, food takes forever but I loved it!   Seriously though, the live music here is wonderful. I was very impressed and just sat and watched  in awe. The guys there could turn any song into something good."}
{"text":"The sushi and sashimi melted in your mouth. I had Miso soup and then we ordered a Caterpillar roll and a Centro roll. The Centro roll had Spicy Tuna, Avocado, topped with Salmon,lemon,green onion and Ponzu Sauce. We also had Yellow tail Sashimi. If you are staying at the Hyatt Regency in Scottsdale this is a must try. Make reservations."}
{"text":"Noh is the only place for me when I need my fix of sushi.  Chef Marc knows how to elegantly prepare the food, hold conversation and make the evening remarkable.  The sushi and sashimi are fresh.  The seating is tight with only six chairs in the front.  However, the intimacy makes it that much more exciting.  I like to be able to talk with the people around me as well as see the fillet of fish in front of me.  My eight year old son is the one who got me started....with eel....yum....  The sushi prices are reasonable and the hotel atmosphere adds the enjoyment. Bon Appetit"}
{"text":"4.5 stars?!?! NOh WAY  This review is for the sushi bar not the lobby bar which is FANTASTIC.   Food: 3 star sushi. 2 star variety. They stick to the popular basics: Maguro, Sake, Hamachi, Ebi & Unagi. That's the whole list. What they have is decent. Limited variety, but given the venue its understandable.   Good list of rolls. If that's your thing you'll probably be quite happy.   Ambience: The Hyatt is GORGEOUS. Eating sushi while listening to live music in the main area is awesome. The lighting is gorgeous. Whole vibe is great.   So why the bad review?  The chef.   Our first day at the Hyatt we were walking the property and I was so excited to see a beautiful sushi bar on property. My wife is pregnant so she can't eat raw fish. She does love things like Hamachi Kama, Tempura, Black Cod, Crab Sunomono etc which a lot of Sushi restaurants serve. So I ask the chef \"Do you have any cooked fish?\" And before I can say \"like hamachi kama\" he rolls his eyes at me and says \"just the shrimp and the eel\". I get it... He must deal with a lot of people who want baked salmon creamed cheese rolls. Still... Not a great experience.   Despite this, on our last night we decide to cozy up at the lounge and order food. I peruse the sushi menu and it's pretty limited so I wonder if they have dishes they only serve at the sushi bar. If so we'd go sit there. I walk over take a look at the fish in the cooler and already I'm getting attitude again. I ask \"is there anything you serve here that you don't serve in the lounge?\" The chef says \"nope\" curtly while the waitress says \"except the secret menu which you get if chef likes you\". Awkward laughs ensue. Is this a joke? Or is there more? The chef definitely doesn't like me.   Then I notice some beautiful Japanese mushrooms in the cooler which I love. I didn't see any dishes with mushrooms on the menu and ask \"oh, what do you serve with the mushrooms\" and the chef says \"nothing.\"  I get that the guy has to deal with tourists. But get over it, you work at a hotel. Hospitality is the name of the game and you pissed off a client and angered me enough that I had to take time to write this review.   Very disappointing."}
{"text":"It's probably the smallest restaurant in Arizona.  There's only six seats in front of the sushi bar next to the bar.  We went when live music was playing and it was waaaay too loud for us.  Now on to the good parts.  The chef and his assistant couldn't be nicer and genuine people.  I could tell they really wanted us to enjoy the food.  The food was fresh and delicious and portioned just right.  The prices were a bargain compared to other omakase I've had in town.  Next time I think I'll ask them to sub some Nigiri sushi for the  first courses.  Oh and did I mention five wine and sake pairings were $15!! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"VERY small.... counter service with 6 seats.  The sushi was prepared in a timely manner, the chef was pleasant enough (took a while for him to seem to warm up or something) , the sushi tasted good - truthfully, I have had better .The fish is not fresh, as in not flown in daily, but was told they know how to keep it fresh. It did not taste bad.  I think there should be more variety and creativity since the place is so small. Definitely should be able to customize a roll for you.  We ordered edamame, which was perfect. We had seared tuna appetizer, that was just mediocre. It was seared with a few sesame seeds and cayenne pepper. It was very bland with some heat to it.  The rainbow roll was good, the spicy tuna was great and the California roll was good as well. I would try it again, but hoping for more creativity or something."}
{"text":"I ordered from NOH three times during my stay at Gainey Ranch, and was never disappointed.   The service from the two expert sushi-slingers was great! A good staff goes a long way and they were always at the top of their game.  I also found some of the best wasabi I've ever had, and being a hot-pepper-head, I had a huge smile on my face the whole time as a result.  They also have cold unfiltered saki, which is the only kind I will drink now.   As an added bonus, you can order sushi at an outdoor table from the bar menu and they will bring it over!   Try the tuna poke salad - slightly spicy, and quite yummy.  If you're looking for a roll - try the Centol Roll with the Sushi combo, it was also quite good.  ~Kanpai!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed that they couldn't do a salmon avocado roll I mean it's not that hard to do. The quality of the food is good, but still shocked they couldn't do my favorite roll.  Won't be back."}
