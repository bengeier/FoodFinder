{"text":"Ew. Just got the grilled chicken, and it doesn't even taste like real chicken. Its got that nasty rubber texture that you get with cheap fat chicken. I should have driven across to Chik fil a. oh, well. thought i'd give them a try. Zaxby's, get yourself some good quality chicken, people!"}
{"text":"Horrible food! I found 2 long hairs in my food.  The place is dirty and the food looks nothing like the advertisements. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"This is an update to my former review. First of all I only when back because a friend of mine wanted to go back to see if we had a better experience. What we witnessed was atrocious!! A different manager (Shameka or something on her name tag) was literally yelling & cussing at an employee as we walked in! She was even using the F word!! How in the world can this supposedly \"Christian\" organization allow managers to act this way?! When I used to work anyone who acted like that would be fired on the spot!! What is wrong with this company??? Needless to say we walked right back out. Neither of us, out friends or our family will ever diner here (or likely at any Zaxby's whose corporation allows such behavior).  DO NOT EAT HERE WITH KIDS OR FAMILY!!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is very rude, sauce was not on my wings as I told them too. My friend told them dine in and they gave him a take out. I also asked for some extra sauce and the cashier rolled her eyes."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I pick up my food in drive thru the girl at the window had attitude first she gave me the wrong food order & I told her thank you 2 times n she just ignore me what a customer service never going back again"}
{"text":"I love the chicken fingers here as well as the crushed ice! I come in regularly so several members of the staff recognize me and provide a warm welcome. The restaurant always seems clean to me and the crew is always busy.   It would be nice to see more consistency in the employees.  Don't know why there would be so much turnover, unless perhaps this is a training location for Zaxby's."}
{"text":"I have Always had great food and great service. thank you zaxby's fort mill. Been there several times never disapointed . Can tell they put pride in there food and it's always clean"}
{"text":"Most inept Zaxby's I have ever visited. Last time, I went through the drive through and 2 items were left out. So, this time I went inside. I didn't watch them make the food, but got home, opened the bag, and the blackend blue salad had no chicken of any type. They also left out the texas toast. I won't be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Have had the Zensation salad twice.  Very good, and plenty of it.  Only issue is that I had to wait a long time as the girl who took the order made it for dining in and I specifically said that it was 'to go'."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Zaxby's I've ever been to. The first time my online order wasn't even ready. The second time I had to wait 20 minutes to get my food. This establishment is slow to take orders and get them correct as well as having orders out in a decent amount of time. I'm still wait I on my food as I write this review. I will drive clear across Charlotte before driving a minute to get food from here."}
{"text":"\"Zaxby's: Real Chicken\" -  It really should be, \"Zaxby's: Real SALTY Chicken.\"   Ordered a club sandwich, and there was enough sodium in it to keep it preserved for forty years - either that, or trigger a heart attack!! We also ordered their potato chip appetizer. It was blah. It needs to decide what it is: salty and crispy chips, or salty, limp slices of potato.   While some may love this place for fast food chicken, I didn't like the limited menu that basically contains salt, grease and chicken."}
{"text":"Very disrespectful tones when taking orders at the drive thru as well as when taking the money and giving drinks and food. Surprisingly they got the order correct but the rudeness was very uncalled for especially considering a polite \"thank you\" was said when change was given back and when we got our drinks (which they had no trays for) and food. If I can say \"thank you\" even after being rudely spoken too then I feel like \"your welcome\" can be said back to me. Customer service is key and the drive thru section has failed at that miserably.  I personally don't feel they even deserve 1 star!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Cashier was great. Manage never came from the back to see why she was needed"}
{"text":"Zaxby's chicken tenders and crinkle fries are delicious!!  They have a nice selection of dipping sauces to choose from. The staff was very friendly and the service was fast."}
{"text":"I expected my wings to be completely tossed in the wing sauce. But no, the staff was too lazy to do that so instead they just put the chicken on the platter and squirted the wing sauce on it. The chicken just look like regular plain fried chicken. How hard is it for them to toss the wings in the sauce, seriously?"}
{"text":"They have good service and the food is normally pretty good.  The lines move quickly And they almost always get the order correct.  I normally get the fried house salad and it's always delicious.  They have a lot of young people working here but they are professional.  I hope they continue with this level of service."}
{"text":"Being a total chicken whore, it was only a matter of time before I got my filthy mitts on some Zaxby's. My brain scramblingly hot Girlfriend and I blasted into this place and wolfed down some of their chicken fingers.The chicken was surprisingly good, and their sauce was impressive. Nothing quite like some impressive sauce to punch up your afternoon, if you get my drift.......do you? Cole slaw was pretty weak and the fries were pretty unremarkable. The blaring God awful country music sort of sucked as well. Despite the fries and crappy music, all was going well until I tried to ride the little tiny bike by the front door. Jesus...you would have thought I tried to burn the place down...Relax Zaxby;s...its not about you all the time. Or lawsuits and insurance, or the safety and mental well being of the other patrons.Try fun Zaxby's....try fun."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken tender platter and everything was well cooked and fine! I didn't have to wait for my food for that long. The entire place was clean and prepped properly."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. Everyone working was rolling their eyes and moving like sloths and when my food came out 15 minutes later there was brown lettuce on my chicken finger plate...which doesn't even come with lettuce. Not sure why these people would want to work in the service industry if you can even provide service."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and it was the it was the best lunch i think i've had in a long time.    Good chicken, good fries, and the best part is the shaved ice for your soda!"}
{"text":"I work in between this location and the location in Harrisburg. This location is far less busy during lunch time so I figured I would try it today. Even though they had less customers, the wait was longer then the usual Harrisburg wait time. Salad was a noticeably smaller portion and they forgot my milkshake. No big deal, so I stand and wait for it. After 3 mins she hands me a milkshake that has frost on the side like its been sitting in a cooler. Guess Ill be visiting the Harrisburg location exclusively from now on."}
{"text":"Always so slow at this location. Calling in an order and coming to pick it up and then STILL HAVING TO WAIT. If you like Zaxbys prepare to wait, otherwise I would suggest going to another food place."}
{"text":"Zaxby's is easily my favorite fast food style restaurant when driving through the south. The nibblers are perfectly cooked, topped with Zaxby's sauce (not sure exactly what it is but its mmm mmm good) and the placed on a buttered and grilled roll. It's delicious people.  Not to be out done, the Zaxby's fried chicken salad is also outstanding.  The portion size is large.  My loves the boneless wings and shakes. If you haven't eat a Zaxby's yet I would highly recommend it. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"The service and food are deplorable at this Zaxby's.  They are so slow and unprofessional and at times down right rude.  Stay away from this location if you want fast service and good food.  There is a new Zaxby's at the prime outlet mall about 5 minutes away with much faster service and superior food."}
{"text":"Manager called to apologize for the inconvenience, said that milkshakes are back in stock. I appreciated that. Wife did drive thru that night and waited over 15 minutes from the time she ordered the milk shake before receiving it. Still terribly slow. Milkshake was delicious though!"}
{"text":"This is the best fast casual restaurant in Concord. The food is always fresh and comes out in a very timely fashion. It is a great product for a great price."}
{"text":"It has been about a month since I have been to zaxbys but last run I did go  everything  was fresh all the the staff inside were so helpful and kinda. One time I did go there and a girl messed up my order bug the manager fix it so everything was ok but it was like a year ago but overall great place to go you will love the foods"}
{"text":"This place is still disqusting!  . I only hope the kitchen doesn't look like this. I don't think I'll be back until they do some cleaning. Geez What are all the ppl behind the counter doing. ?"}
{"text":"This place is basically across the street from me so I'll hit it once a month or so, I always go in and it's always been a decent experience.  I get the Snax combo and I'm always impressed by the quality of the chicken, I wish there was more but over all it's usually better than KFC's tenders.    Really my only issues with the place are that when they mop the floor with that finish I have a hard time not sliding around and service is always meh.  Not looking for perfection in a fast food place but you can do more than the bare minimum."}
{"text":"I ordered The Blue - Blackened Salad and found a fly hidden under a piece of lettuce.  I communicated the issue to the manager on duty and she was very apologetic and offered to refund my money.  I certainly appreciate the gesture, but I'll never eat at another Zaxbys again for the fear of seeing another bug in my food."}
{"text":"Was excited to see a Zaxbys open up on the west end of town. Unfortunately, this one doesn't measure up. I've been there twice now.  The first time the chicken strips were over cooked. They were dry with little flavor. Thought I would give it another chance.  It was no better. The chicken smelt like it had been cooked in burnt oil. It was extremely dry and over cooked. Next time I want Zaxbys, I will make the trip back to the east side Zaxbys."}
{"text":"lord jesus bless this chicken. when i say this food touched my soul i mean these boneless wings made their way to my stomach and on the way down high fived my inner being. god bless the person who founded zaxbys. for my last meal all i want is a mouth full of hot honey mustard wings and things. (the service here sucks but i could've waited 100 years for my number to be called and would still give this place 5 stars)"}
{"text":"I love zaxbys and always get the chicken finger plate but lately the chicken has gotten REALLY SALTY!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Zaxbys for 20+ years. I was pretty excited to see one opening just a few miles from home...until i waited 20 minutes between ordering and getting to the drive thru window. I know these things happen, but no apology was given, the food was cold and we actually had to hand some of it back as it was incorrect.   Hopefully this is just growing pains and it will be sorted out. I love Zaxbys and I know how great they can be."}
{"text":"How disappointing apparently they don't teach their to count.    Nothing on the order was correct.  the receipt  reflected what I ordered. But received less.    Never going to this location again.     Tried calling the manager but was left on hold for over 10 minutes, I gave up on that."}
{"text":"Clean. Friendly, quick service. I got the grilled chicken salad and it was just as I expected for Zaxby's. However, the lettuce was fresh, except for a couple pieces. Other salad toppings were fresh. The chicken breast was very tasty and cooked properly. Easy parking. Easy in and out for the main roads and I-85."}
{"text":"Be very very careful going through the drive thru!  Every time I have gone thru the drive thru at this location my order is always short at least one item that I ordered and paid for."}
{"text":"Horrible service Anotonio was a unprofessional worker if ive ever seen one he walked off mid order without saying excuse me and didnt apologize when he came back three minuted later, we were also the only people in the store Thanks Antonio"}
{"text":"We stopped on our way through to the coast and we were all unimpressed. The grilled chicken on my salad was extremely salty. I couldn't eat it.  The sandwich my husband got was a mess. The (unsweetened) tea was absolutely disgusting. It has an extremely unpleasant taste, whether a cleaner residue or the local water I'm not sure but it is undrinkable. Be sure to pass this place by."}
{"text":"I am so angry, frustrated, and just plain sick and tired of paying for something and then not get what I pay for.  No, I didn't go back, as I live 10 miles away, and only discovered this incompetence when I got home.  What's even more upsetting, is the fact that when I was trying to place my order, the young lady was giggling over the speaker, causing me to to believe she was having a silly conversation with someone on her (personal) phone.  When this happened, I should have known at that moment my order was going to be wrong, and should have checked my order before I drove away.  I ordered and paid for a 10 pcs chicken finger meal, and when I got home, I not only did not have a 10 pc meal, it was 4 pieces.  I am just sick and tired of having stop, and the time, every time I order a meal from fast food restaurants - this case Zaxby's - and dig through the package to verify what I paid for is what I ordered.  It's really beyond ridiculous.  It's sad that service is so poor, the people working at these places are so uncaring and incompetent, and it seems as though it has become the norm.  If I were go into the establishment, order something and then walk out without paying, I would be pursued and arrested for stealing; yet, you all stole from me by charging me for something I didn't get.  I tried calling back to complain to a manger, but as it always is, the line is busy."}
{"text":"I love there Cobb salads snd ice and sweet tea. My son loves the chicken fingers and honey mustard. Salads are huge;)"}
{"text":"30mins after ordering now we have our food. Sunday afternoon lunch at 2:30pm. Horrible customer service, all the employees look like they have no motivation and are preoccupied with other things ( laughing and joking with each other, texting, etc. ) besides making the customer happy. Horrible place to decide to stop to eat!"}
{"text":"I love the zaxbys club its my go to! The nibbler bits are great aswell. Prices here are perfect and the food always come out quick."}
{"text":"I can't say anything about the service as my wife picked up on her way home. I got chicken blt which was seasoned with salt then cooked in salt, then topped off with some salt. Combine that with the fries and my sodium intake is good for the week. I made it about a third into the sandwich before I felt ill.   I'm not a huge health nut and eat my share of bad food, but this was not worth the calories."}
{"text":"We love us some Zaxby's. This one has never failed us. Has always had good hot food and a great atmosphere for dining. I love the chicken finger plate and the zax sauce. Can't ever get enough of the zax sauce."}
{"text":"I rarely do reviews, but without feedback, businesses cannot address issues and improve.  First of all, my family and I were glad to see the opening of the new Zaxby's on Hwy 21 near Carolwinds. We live one mile from this new location, and have been regular customers at the Pleasant Rd Zaxby's, as well as their restaurants in many other cities. This new Zaxby's opened earlier this year, but has struggled to improve past their initial training period. On our visits, the staff consists of very young employees who's customer service skills are very poor.  On every visit, our orders are missing items; usually sauces that we were charged extra for. Yesterday, is probably our last visit to this location. This time the sauces were correct, but food was missing from both of our orders. We ordered 2 chicken finger plates; a 5 piece, and a 6 piece. Both orders were short on the number of pieces paid for. And lastly, the food was awful. The chicken was rubbery and overcooked, and the fries were stone cold and over saturated in seasoning salt. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!! For an example of excellent customer service, by employees of ALL ages , go right down the street to Culvers.  The menus are not the same, but it's nice to know your order will be correct, and delivered with courtesy."}
{"text":"Love Zaxby's, copied the sauce for home made chicken strips. I've been to many in several states, the quality of food/service is very close. Dependable good eats from NC to Ga."}
{"text":"Repeat slow service and overly salty food. Each time I have been here the drive thru line is across the parking lot and takes nearly 15 minutes. Do yourself a favor and go to the zaxbys near concord mills mall."}
{"text":"Not very clean. The team was composed of all high school/college kids who had zero customer service knowledge, especially how to handle accidentally not preparing part of our order. No apology or concern to correct their error. Will stick to the location in Matthews from now on."}
{"text":"Stay far away from this place, in fact, I think the health department needs to make an immediate visit!  Flies all over the trash can, urine smells, something leaking all over the floor, tripping hazards and an employee handling the food sneezes and does not cover her mouth.  I threw my food away and left.  Never again."}
{"text":"If you like real crispy wings (I do) order them naked and say extra crispy.  Then you can get 2 or 3 sauces on the side! This way they do not get soggy and stay very crispy.  The only use small quality chicken wings and they are awesome.  I have had some younger workers up front that had zero customer service, but we all started out young ourselves.  Just let them know that they need to improve on their questionnaire they provide at the counter and they will."}
{"text":"If you're looking for chicken tenders, wings or a great salad then this is the place!  The staff will make recommendations if you're not sure of the menu. They are very friendly & quickly make you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Zazby's has great salads. We stopped for salads but this location is really dirty. Floor is slippery & dirty under every table. We had to clean our own table while employees leaned against the counter socializing.  We ordered in but received our food packaged to go, which is no big deal but the salad sizes are not the same. The guys are complaining their salads are too small (& they are definitely bigger usually) but they do taste good.  I gave them some if my chicken fingers to settle them down.  Overall, the place could be cleaner & the employees could be more attentive. The restaurant just need a a deep cleaning."}
{"text":"I had wings today with a teriyaki source, and it was the worst chicken wings I have ever had in my life. The chicken was burnt as the source was too."}
{"text":"This is the only Zaxby's I will ever go to in the Charlotte area! I've had issues if I go close to closing time but that's understandable. Always great food!!"}
{"text":"Came here and was offered the Zensation salad.. Get to the window and get told they are out of the dressing for that signature zalad so when I told the employee since they were out of the signature zalad dressing I would like to change my zalad the girl rolls her eyes.... If you're gonna charge more than Chickfila for a salad have better customer service.. I told the manager that came to the window (twice) that I wanted \"the blue blackened\" I get home and I have The Caesar zalad fried with one Caesar dressing and one light ranch dressing................... Extremely disappointed"}
{"text":"Three strikes in a row your out. No problems with the kitchen staff, they're fast and proficient. The widow service is what I'm rating, specifically the second shift. Rush you to order: check, long widow wait before greeted: check, sloppy milkshakes: check, incorrect and missing items from order: check. Expect these four things, and you shouldn't be disappointed. Truly unfortunate, they have great salads for sure, just make sure to check they've given you your dressing before you drive off."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant Friday night and I had to wait 45 mins for my chicken wings after the staff told me they would be it out in twenty minutes. I had to pull up to the window and they forgot I ordered. They gave my food to somebody else. The evening staff at that restaurant needs to get their stuff together. Very horrible service. To much playing on phones instead of working. The shift manager was very rude also."}
{"text":"I am giving them 2 stars solely because I have had a few good experiences here, however, my most recent experience made me rethink whether I will ever be back. We ordered our food in the drive thru one whole hour before closing. You would think the restaurant was already closed when we ordered. They were in the process of cleaning for the day. When we ordered sweet tea, we were given unsweetened tea. When we asked for it to be corrected, the woman told me that she lost the stirrer for the sweet tea. Instead of telling me there want any sweet tea, she chose to give me the wrong drink. When asking her to correct it she rolled her eyes and acted very rudely. We also asked for AND were charged for extra zax sauce and noticed it wasn't in the bag. When we told her she handed it to us after poking a hole in the top with her fingernails. I have never been treated so disrespectfully in the drive-thru of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Some of THE SLOWEST staff in creation!!!! Line is almost out the door. One person at the register. Everyone is moving in slow motion. No sense of urgency. No pep in their step. Customers been standing around waiting for their food. Just plain slow."}
{"text":"My first time eating here. I asked the guy what I should get. He told me their signature sandwich (I don't remember the name), it was basically 3 chicken strips between 2 pieces of Texas toast, it wasn't good and I would never get it again. Then I asked what else they are known for, he said their wings with bone in. They were actually pretty good. I got them with the traditional/regular hot sauce. They were big in size for wings, pretty meaty. Those I would get again. But the price was $1 each wing, nothing at all to \"rush\" back for. If they were more like $0.75 each...I might come back sooner than a year from now. After everyone who I talked to saying it was really good, I was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Corporate needs to come and take a look at this,  this is an absolute embarrassment. If this is owned by a franchise he should have this store pulled back! Slow doesn't begin to describe it, 40 minutes on one grilled chicken salad.. I still got my food before the four top next to me.. The place is absolutely disgusting dirty as well no one cleaned a single table."}
{"text":"Food is decent but why is there only one register open during lunch?  Completely unacceptable. The poor girl at the front was doing everything with no help. Get it together Zaxby's.   Update****  Service still sucks. There is still only one girl running the register at lunch with a line almost to the door. The lobby was packed with people waiting for their orders. I guess if I want chicken I'll have to go across the street to Bojangles. Unacceptable"}
{"text":"your kids will like it; you may not be so crazy about it.  Not enough 'adult food\" ... everything is finger food but they do have a couple sandwiches.  Cole slaw is amazingly bland.  Crinkle fries are at least crispy on the outside.  Cashier ( a youngish girl) seemed peeved we didn't know the available sauces by heart, and was impatient with any questions.  Needs better customer service training, or an attitude adjustment.  Wish Matthews' KFC never closed ..."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good and the zax sauce is awesome.  The chicken tenders are kinda small but they make up with it in quantity and lots of sides.   Also, the drive thru isn't the quickest."}
{"text":"Drivethru was horrible today. Please fix your drivethru mic.  The wait was over 10 minutes.  Oh! And my order was wrong."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed I got a wings and things plate and my wings were cold as hell like they were just sitting there for hours. Won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I honestly don't even know where to start. We live nearby this Zaxby's location so we've been there often. Every time we go something always goes wrong. Wrong order, no straws, wrong drink, missing items, etc. The employees are consistently rude and disrespectful. This last visit takes the cake. When ordering something simple off the menu that we've ordered many times the woman did not understand what I was asking for and rudely said just drive around to the window. When at the window I was told what I wanted wasn't an option on the register but yet it was on the menu. So they had to charge me for each individual nibbler at $1.59 instead of the set of three for $3.99. Which we've ordered these nibblers plenty of times to know that there is a freaking key on the register. The manager and employee were very rude and it was obvious that they were saying nasty things while I was getting my money back.   Too bad the service is so horrible because the food is actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Going on a 45 minute wait (and counting) for dine in. It is not crowded at all but as I look around, it appears that my table is not the only one.   The drink station is extremely messy and the ice/water machine has no ice at all in it.   This location seems to be very poorly managed and/or under-staffed. I feel for the 2 employees that are trying to cover everything but this is inexcusable. It is close to home but I highly doubt I'll be back and would not recommend to others."}
{"text":"I have had the same experience as John L.    I have been here numerous times and every time the order is wrong....every time i go back thinking things would have gotten better but same results.  I love the food but it is rediculous that you can get 6 out of 6 orders wrong months apart.   The time the order is fixed the rest of the food is cold.   Get it right Zaxbys or you'll be out of business.   If the chicken wasn't so good I would rate 1 star."}
{"text":"Very slow and unprofessional to say the least, this location had a great staff not to long ago and only after being open for a short while the staff has completely changed and the service has as well.   The person taking orders usually is more focused on chatting with their friends than providing good customer service. The ordering process comes off as being an extreme task as oppose to a wonderful blessing = a job.   I don't want to even bother with the drive thru experiences. Why go back you ask with all the bad customer service? I'll tell you, my teenage daughter LOVES this place and she even has my son liking the tenders and she doesn't care about service much (YET, as she is my child and will one day as she has experienced the best of the best and worst of the worst).  The FOOD Zaxby has good food for the most part and being fast food that's a plus as I'm not a huge fast food fan. The chicken is flavorful and full of seasoning and the Zaxby sauce is classic."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. From all the Zaxby's around Charlotte this one is the best one by far. The customer service was incredible for a fast food."}
{"text":"Worst Zaxby's in history. Poor customer service, wrong orders, long lines. Every time that a used to go it was always something wrong,'long wait. I used to go every week but now not anymore. I rather go to other locations when the are on my way."}
{"text":"My neighbor found a bug in her salad and the manager did nothing and was actually rude to her. They're slow and the orders are almost always wrong."}
{"text":"This place is way underrated! We were craving a chicken sandwich and so we came to Zaxby's. The woman recommend the Cajun Club and no joke we were both amazed. The chicken kicks Chick-fil-a's butt and the fries were hot and crispy too! There was a boy diligently cleaning tables and sweeping too so thumbs up."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is cooked to perfection and customer service is great and refreshing! The manager Gregory was really nice! When you have customers that ask for a lot people usually tend to get annoyed but he was so patient and kept a smile and great attitude! I definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"GREAT ZAC. It's a good place. Food is expensive compared to Chick Fila but it is tasty. I hate how you have to pay extra for extra sauce, but it is what it is. The restaurant is clean and the bathrooms are nice, but most Zackbys are."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service not to mention out of lemonade so wife had to drink water then she asked for a sauce pack and they tried charging her . Not the 1st time here that service was horrible waited a few weeks ago for over 20 min in drive thru because they gave our shakes to someone else in the dinning room ! The rudest one was  Alex says he's manager if so I feel sorry for this store not only the way he treated us but as we were eating hearing him talk down to the employees ."}
{"text":"Spend your money and time somewhere else. Rude, rude, RUDE MANAGER! Employees messed up on an order and instead of apologizing, the manager decides to yell at his customers when asked when the food was coming out after a 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"My sister raved about this place. It was okay probably would not go back. The sweet tea taste lime sweet nothing. Chicken wingettes were chicken nuggets.  Wrinkly fries were ok."}
{"text":"I just love Zaxby's! The chicken is always fresh and has a unique flavor which is amazing. The portions are large and the milkshakes are to die for!!"}
{"text":"4 of us are here waiting on our food. One gentleman has already asked for his money back. This place has the slowest fast food service I've seen. It also takes 5 people to answer 1 phone. The cashier stopped the orders just to make sweet tea. Oh and not to mention they all have attitudes. Not to mention we all have salads. One order has already been messed up. The line just got huge."}
{"text":"I didn't know what Zaxby's was until I moved to N.C. but I do glad I learned l. I LOVE salads, and the buffalo blu salad isn't something you typically get outside of a half way decent restaurant, but I think Zaxby's just be better. And the garlic toast is  literally a slice of unexpected heaven."}
{"text":"I go to this Zaxbys often because I work in the mall. But the service is extremely slow, the staff are CLUELESS and rude. There's a reason why their score on here is so low. On a Sunday, during the lunch rush, you should have more than one incompetent person on the register."}
{"text":"This location is awful....EVERYTIME (no exaggeration ) I go my order is wrong and missing something. I dont know what the people have going on here but its extremely concerning that they can't compose an order correctly at least once....."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but staff needs some training in manners. More interested in talking with each than being courteous.Do the words\" thank you\" mean anything, girls? Be nice!"}
{"text":"Great Zaxby's food and the server was friendly. The zalads are big enough for two."}
{"text":"I have to say that I truly don't understand the other reviews here. I moved nearby in December and have gone there regularly since and have yet to have slow service, or even a bad meal. I can't speak for others, but this one has my stamp. :)"}
{"text":"I've never seen the lack of concern from a group of people (mainly kids), but also the management of any restaurant I've visited. Have been going here on and off since they opened. The kids that work here are rude, not interested in quality service AT ALL, and the management allows it to continue... year after year. The constantly get orders wrong and act as if it's the customers fault. No apologies, just attitudes. The owner of this franchise should be ashamed of themselves. They truly need an entirely new crew!"}
{"text":"Totally love this place!    I'm new to being a Zaxby's customer but I'm so glad I decided to give this place a try!  I ordered the chicken finger plate, with fries and coleslaw...the Zax sauce is a must have! It's a creamy mix of spices that pairs very well with the chicken.  The chicken breading is delicious! And the fact that your food is always hot and made to order...AWESOME!!! And that piece of buttered toast is heavenly!   Overall this had to be one of the best \"fast food\" places I've enjoyed in a long time!"}
{"text":"The food here has always been delicious. I have visited this location on several occasions, and it has always been clean and the food made to order, without a long wait, and always good. I haven't had issues with the customer service, even though I see some younger kids behind the counter, which usually leads to issues (hot-headed teens...lol), but I have no complaints, only compliments. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My kids love Zaxbys chicken finger sandwiches and I often pick food for them from different Zaxbys locations. Employees at this location have a bad attitude problem. They act like they don't want to be there and rude. Simple task becomes a turnoff. I recommend staying away from this location."}
{"text":"Good food, although those calorie counts are scary.  However, they have been out of items on occasion.  You also have to watch out for your change at this location.  I've had the girl at the drive through \"forget\" to give me change twice now (once not giving me change froma $20 on a $9 order."}
{"text":"Great quick meal. Love the boneless wings and club sandwich.  This location is always clean, fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Ordered the Kickin Chicken Sandwich and it was really dry. They hardly put any ranch or tongue torch sauce on it. That's the reason I get the sandwich, for the sauce. Most likely won't go back to this location. If I do I'll make sure to check the sandwich before I leave."}
{"text":"Food was ok for fast food.  Place could be cleaned better.  Employees need a lesson on manners and customer service.    Over priced for the cheap quality. Probably wont eat it again."}
{"text":"Freindly greeting, before asking for my order. Service was quick.  The cobb salad was fresh as was the iced tea. They're a step above fast food by bring the food to the table and the salads are served in a huge real honest to goodness plate.  No plastic clamshells here."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here to grab a bite to eat on our lunch break. We both ordered salads to go.   Easy, right?  Wrong. So wrong.   We waited forever....only to get our food (orders were not correct) and no salad dressing in the bag!  And the customer service could have used some improvement too! It's not our fault this order is wrong. I can't deal with managers that act like it's the end of the world that I expect you to correct it!   Get it together Zaxby's! I really wanna love you and return to this location!   But for now....Meh"}
{"text":"I entered the restaurant and was not greeted for about 3 minutes while the cashier stood at the counter talking to another employee. When the cashier finally took my order, it was given to me on a tray when I ordered it to go. When another employee told the young lady that made my order that was supposed to be to go the young lady looked at her and say you talking to somebody else because I have something to go do. I could not believe she said that to her. All I was trying to do was get my food and leave and they are arguing about who is going to put it in a to go container. This is not the kind of customer service that I expect when I come to Zaxby's."}
{"text":"I will say, there there is usually a slight wait whether you decide to drive-thru or go inside. This is because they always seem to make the food fresh/made-to-order. Unlike most other complains at this location, I've never gotten a wrong order. This is close to my home, so I've been to this location 10+ times over the last two years. The staff is always pleasant ... I've never encountered anyone I'd classify as \"rude\".  I'll take the longer wait times as long as it continues to mean I'm getting fresh food. Keep it up Zaxby's!"}
{"text":"I love Zaxby's and this is one typically does a great job! The food is always great and the service is too. I have read the other reviews and I think that every place will have its bad times. The one thing I hate about the company is that they charge .25 cents for each extra sauce... really sucks but I can deal with it. Hope this helps a little."}
{"text":"I was so confused! I didn't know this place was a fast food joint.  I ordered chicken strips and a Caesar salad and they were both pretty good. The chicken was tender but a bit too salty.  I liked the creamy/tangy dipping sauce and the Caesar salad was pretty good for a fast food restaurant.  Overall, i wasn't too excited about anything, but it served my late night chicken craving."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! Always a bad experience here no matter how many chances I gave it. My most recent experience was the worst. We had placed an order online which stated it would be ready by 1:05. I left the house around 1:00 since I live close by and waited in a long line at the drive-thru to pick up my order just as my family has done many times before. This time, I was told that I needed to come inside to get my order, when I asked why, they told me online orders needed to be picked up inside. Already frustrated with the fact that I just wasted almost 10 minutes waiting in line for no reason, I went in. I wasn't greeted until a moment later after I waved over an employee to get some service. Once I handed them my confirmation number showing proof I had already paid, they looked at it as if they have never seen an online order in their lives. The food wasn't even ready! I asked the girl why I needed to come in when I have picked up online orders through the drive thru before and she wasn't even sure... So she asked someone and their response was they don't mind giving small orders out through the window, but they prefer people to come in if it's a larger order. I ordered two salads, and a single sandwich. So simple! This does not make sense to me if the food has already been paid for and supposed to be ready-to-go! So after waiting another 10 minutes, my food comes out. The boy who told me I needed to come in told me he was sorry I had to come in and they did not give me any reimbursement for my wait, or any sort of apology for not having my order ready on time. They made me feel like I was an inconvenience to them. In the end, I was supposed to get my order by 1:05, and I did not return home until 1:45. The food was thrown together and was not good. I do NOT recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Worst service I ever had. Only ordered one thing( a milk shake) and received it 25 minutes later only because I confronted them about my order being late. I do not recommend doing anything but going to the drive thru given that they give priority to the drive thru orders."}
{"text":"I ordered Boneless wings and thing & chicken tender plate. Food came out pretty fast and chicken and french fries came cold and not crispy at all"}
{"text":"I went here for a late lunch on a Sunday.  There were around 3 other tables.  No one was at the counter to take my order.  I waved at the lady in the back.  The scowl on her face should have made me run. A few minutes later they came out. I placed my order for a chicken finger meal.  The only change was an extra sauce.  They gave me a side salad which I didn't order. They left the fries off.  I asked if this was my order.  She said you order 75.  I said yes.  Then this is your order   I replied I didn't get a salad I ordered fries.  She looked at me and said you got a salad. I replied I didn't order a salad.  She asked. Do you want a salad? I thought cut my losses.  Then I went to get my drink.  There was no ice in the ice machine.  There were no tongs in the lemon slices.  The person behind me wanted the little cups for ketchup.  There were none of those.  There were no napkins in the dispenser.  I got the last clean table and the person got someone to clean my hem off a table so they could eat.  Lesson learned if the first person you meet scowls. Find another place."}
{"text":"Wasn't greeted when we came in. The drink station was covered in sticky residue. My husband spilled his tea and he went up and told them at the counter as well as the fact that about ten tables around us were dirty and greasy. Had to wait a few minutes for someone to come clean one for us, even though we were one of two customers. The man came out, wiped off one table for us, walked right by the spill, and walked away. No other tables were cleaned for over twenty minutes but someone was out sweeping trash in the parking lot.  On the plus side, the food was pretty good. I would hesitate to come back here again though because I can go to a McDonalds with a better cleanliness record."}
{"text":"pretty dirty on the inside.  my feet were sticking to the floor, the condiment/drink station was a mess with spilled pop everywhere, no napkins in some of the dispensers and 5 straws.  the tables were all dirty too.  if it wasn't the only option besides McDonald's and bojangles we would've gone somewhere else.  oh, and just got my food - not what I ordered."}
{"text":"Very clean new building.  Staff needs to be trained.  Very slow and crappie service.  Owner of this franchise needs to train their crew to serve people.  Wrong orders.  Not calling order numbers.  Have to stand and hope you hear them whisper your number."}
{"text":"Y'all.... they just got a sanitation score of 85. I've never seen that in my entire life. That's nasty."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!! They need to get rid of EVERYONE and start with new people that knows the value  of having happy /repeat consumers ...( there are about 10+ cars in line as I type this)... I was in line and had to go in because my order was wrong after I repeated it 3 times at the speaker"}
{"text":"favorite fast food! antonia was very polite and seemed genuine in taking our order. food was served quickly and was delicious. looked just like the picture on sign. 5.99 for good chicken dinner is hard to beat. bathrooms were clean, too. my only issue was that i was chilly and music in lobby was a little hard to talk over but we will be back for sure! the milkshakes are hard to pass up here."}
{"text":"I rarely eat fast food but when compelled to do so, it's usually a salad at Zaxby's! Today's experience was truly special but for a reason other than the food.  Yes the salad was a generous portion of iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes/veggies and chopped chicken and refreshing ice tea. The speed with which our food was delivered was \"fast\" as in fast food. Deserving of 3 stars.  But what truly made this experience special was a young man working the front of the store. His name is Matt and he did a fine job keeping the eating area clean. But he went a step further greeting each Guest with a sincere \"Hello\"! He inquired \"how's your meal?\" and \"can I get you anything?\". In his unique way, Matt was able to put a smile on each face and subtly transform a hot, hectic Friday into a calm relaxed dining experience.  The world needs more Matts and this Zaxby's has created a unique role for their \"Maitre'D\" better referred to as their ZAMBASSADOR! Stop by on a Thursday or Friday and say hello to Matt....it will make your day!  PS: oh yea......have salad!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst service I've had in ages! Tonight they made McDonald's look like a three-star restaurant! Too busy talking to one another to get my order,  then an incorrect order,  then an overcharge... How hard can it be to give me two pieces of chicken! Best part was when my chicken was handed to me through the window the window slammed behind the delivery without so much as a thank you, kiss my butt or anything else for that matter. Absolutely horrible!"}
{"text":"The worst zaxbys I have ever been in my life, terrible service the food takes over 20 mins to make no matter what the order is this is literally 0stars."}
{"text":"I failed to read the reviews first. I should have known better.  I'll keep this review short.  This was my first and only visit to this place, and I used the drive through. My order was missing one of the two side dishes, so I drove through again to get it. The young girl did apologize, but she didn't look all that surprised.  After leaving I learned a valuable lesson, always inspect your food before you put it in your mouth. Unfortunately, my chicken was not fully cooked.  Good luck to you."}
{"text":"Very clean and well stocked as the employees were actively engaged cleaning speaking to guests as the arrived and left. Food was prepared as expected and with urgency. I would return if in the areas again. Job well done."}
{"text":"While delicious, my spicy bbq boneless wings were tiny. $7.99 for 10 and I had 3-4 that were super small. The picture doesn't do it justice. Seems like in a situation like this, they would have given a few more because they were so small. As pricey as Zaxby's is, give people their monies worth. Please! I was so excited they brought on the spicy bbq flavor. It is my favorite wing and boneless wing flavor.  Other than the baby boneless wings, I received my food very quickly, it was hot and I enjoyed it :)."}
{"text":"I don't eat Zaxby's often - at all really. With all the great talk about Zaxby's, I often wonder why they are never crowded. I ordered the boneless wings (original flavor/sauce). I was craving boneless wings. Service was average, no complaints, no highlights. The food was hot. Really nothing special to say here."}
{"text":"I had every intention of getting a healthy lunch at Panera or McAllisters during work, but then realized that I had to drive past Zaxbys.  That all went out the window.  I cannot pass this place up!    I love the Kickin Chicken Sandwich Meal.  I've only not ordered that one time, and when I ordered something else, I was sad.    I love the fries, the chicken, the bread, the Dr Pepper... its all great.   Sometimes around lunch, this location can get super backed up.  For that reason I never go through the drive through, I just can't see how you'd get out of there.  Pro tip: If you need to make a left when exiting, its not easy.  I normally take a right then do a U-turn."}
{"text":"Thebomb.com. awesome food. The chicken is amazing and so is the sause. being from new york, we have the traditional fast food places (wendys, bk and mcd) but no great chicken places, so if youre from the north, and you're in the south, you gotta go."}
{"text":"When I want a really good chicken sandwich I visit Zaxby's.  They season the bird perfect......wings, chicken fingers, and the old school crinkle cut fries, but what brings this meal together is the Texas toast....thick buttered goodness at it's best!  Don't miss out on this gem...they cook to order so you may have to wait a bit but it's good stuff......a little pricey though."}
{"text":"Food is good, but charge you extra for everything which is a downfall. Ranch should be complimentary, not 25 cents extra."}
{"text":"Stoped at this location when driving thru the area bc we had heard good things about the chain.. but this location is dirty, was HOT inside to the point we were sweating, no changing tables, and out of menu items. The food was ok, I can see why people really like the chicken itself but overall after this visit I won't be back."}
{"text":"This Zaxby's is new in the area and has definitely improved in service and food prep.   I didn't like that my wings weren't fried crispy enough compared to other Zaxby's I've eaten at. I started requesting that the wings get fried a little longer.  There's a lot of young people working here and that's not the problem. The problem is that the staff seem to not take customer service as seriously. Just to place an order recently was a painful event. I waited so long for my order and I had to drive 4 hours to work. I thought I was getting fast food....the manager was hands on person so he helped to expedite my meal.   Things will probably get better in time."}
{"text":"What can  say... Zaxby's is Zaxby's. Some locations are better than others. This one is typical. I used the drive thru which was timely and efficient. My order was correct and nothing major to write home about. I usually get the sweet spicy traditional wings with fries."}
{"text":"This place needs help badly. It has the market it is the only restaurant of it's kind within 8 miles. But if you read the comments on-line the customer service SUCKS! I love Zaxbys so does my family how ever every time we go through the drive though they get the order wrong EVERY TIME!  I went just yesterday I used the order a head on line 6 piece with pasta salad and french fries the receipt they gave me agreed that's I ordered but what did I get cole slaw and pasta salad no fries. And 6 tenders 2 were the size of chicken nuggets and this is also a constant problem I pay $10 for chicken I want 6 full pieces of chicken. I mean come on the menu isn't even complicated but even if it was wrong every time. The last time I went I got 4 pieces of chicken not 6 and sometimes they are over cooked it's just very frustrating!"}
{"text":"I go here for the tasty Zaxby's sauce which makes their average chicken really good.  I also like using their online ordering since sometimes the wait can be a little long for \"fast\" food. In my opinion, the wings are just decent and the fries are usually soggy.  I would definitely choose Zaxby's over a trip to a Wendy's or Bojangles any day."}
{"text":"Can't give zero stars or else I would. I received food poisoning from this Zaxbys for the second time. At this point I'm done going to any Zaxbys. Was not able to hold down solid food for 4 days. If your food is not hot, don't eat it."}
{"text":"Great for catering corporate lunches & events."}
{"text":"I ordered 10 wings and couldn't believe what I got! I counted 13 little teeny bones with small amounts of chicken on the bones. These cant be wings from a grown chicken! They look like they came from a Cornish game hen! This place counts each portion of a wing as a wing....I live in NJ when we order 10 wings we get 10 full grown chicken wings, they do not count each section of the wing as a wing. I can't believe Zaxbys is still in business !!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service.  Food is always great. Employees are really hard working young people. A young manager about my 23 year old son age handled issues and customers like an intelligent cool, calm collective person my age, ( that info I refuse to give out)!!!"}
{"text":"The kids that work there are rude (in drive through). I mean basically I can do without the attitudes and be sure to check your order before you pull off. If you've never been here, as soon as you pull up to the drive through they will ask you what you want (so know ahead) and then you will get a sigh or some girl with a high pitched voice give you an attitude.   What happened to \"order when ready\" or a simple \"sure?\" Instead you get a loud sigh and an attitude. I don't want them to spit in my food so if I feel the need I address it after I get it. It's happened too many times to count.    No respect. No home training.   The food on the other hand tastes like any other zaxbys. I'm rating the staff."}
{"text":"Not only did I have to wait in a long line that had me late for work. They wouldn't accept my gift card and I had to pay for my meal with my debit card. This is unfair to me and id like to have something done about it."}
{"text":"Monroe use to be good. Totally sucks now. I still come here,  but no employees give a crap. Manger should be fired.  Update**** Went inside and they still didn't give a flying crap. Dude who was cooking looked at me like total discuss.  Lol. I hate it for the owners of this restaurant.   8:29pm December 11, 2016"}
{"text":"Less than stellar service when I visit this establishment. If its not the fries being under cooked, its them giving me the wrong order. To top you'd expect an assistant manager to know how to properly load a gift card. Had no help from the manager either so I had to get help from corporate. They don't clean their parking lot either, pulled in one time instead of risking drive thru service and theres vomit in the parking lot. I just wish more time was taken to cook the food, and check orders before they are handed out."}
{"text":"Sorry for the two stars as you are a brand new location, but you really have to address the noise level in your cavernous building.  Don't know what, but this location is noticeably louder than other locations, so please check with the franchise to see what can be done.  The food and service are certainly a solid three star so the atmosphere drags it down to two.  Wife and I came for lunch.  I earlier told her that Zaxby's is just chicken, but she insisted that others had told her that she could order other things.  What she missed was the dangling participle, \",,,so long as it is chicken.\"  Their chicken tenders and boneless wings (otherwise known as nuggets) are good.  Cooked perfectly and not greasy they are as they should be.  There is quite a variety of sauces for dipping and even more for their wings.  If you are looking for a tough-person contest, take on some of their hottest wing sauces.  Prepare to die!  Crispy French fries, salads are nice sized portions and iced tea is authentic and good.  BUT...the building is all hard surfaces.  Floor, walls, ceiling create nearly an echo chamber effect.  You can hear everything.   When ordering you are facing a nice cashier that you cannot hear and she cannot hear you.  Lots of repeating back and forth because you are competing with the noise of the kitchen, the conversations behind you and the train depot loudspeaker bellowing out order numbers that are ready.  It is amazing and you have to feel sorry for the people who work there, but in reality, they get used to the near constant level of sound.  So, if you like chicken...this is a good choice.  You can have chicken tenders on a bun, cut into smaller hunks (boneless wings), on top of salad greens or by themselves."}
{"text":"25 MINUTES FOR DRIVE THRU!!!!! NEVER going here again! I know it's lunch time but damn no drive thru should take that long!!"}
{"text":"I love zaxbys. Whenever I'm craving a quick chicken dinner, I'd rather go to zaxbys over KFC or any other fast food chicken place. While I enjoy the food, the staff here is pretty bad.  For 3 times, they've messed up my order. Now, this isn't little nit picky stuff like no pickles on a burger, this is a mess up that's cost me money.  3 times, I've asked for large entrees, and large entrees is what's on my receipt after I pay, but for those 3 times, they always short change me on food.  Going from regular to large is a pretty decent bump in price, so imagine my anger when I come home to see how they've screwed me out of my food after taking my extra money.   I know I know, I should've checked my order before I leave, but I shouldn't have to for a place that should have their stuff together.  Whenever I do make the long drive back to get my order corrected, 3 times instead of making a new order (since it's cold having to drive back and forth), they just throw the extra food in a side box and hand it to me. Twice, they've managed to miss half of the order that they were expected to correct.  I love zaxbys, but I wish there was another one closer to me, because this one has some serious service issues."}
{"text":"I only visit Zaxby's if my co-workers select is for our Monday lunch meeting. Otherwise, I would never select it for a meal. I really don't understand what people like about Zaxby's. Their chicken tenders are greasy, the wings are tiny. Their salads are OK, but not nearly as good as Chick Fil A or other fast food restaurants. Sorry, not a fan."}
{"text":"Wings and things All day! That shit is fire! Lol ain't got nothing wrong to say about zax"}
{"text":"This place is very SLOW and the employees are not all that great. At times can be very rude. Other than that, the food was amazing. I was shocked it was hot which means it was made fresh!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Didn't even speak to us. Acted like she was very annoyed to be there.  Then when we got our food she didn't smile or say thank you.  Very very rude.  Maybe management needs to hire people that can smile!!  I would not go back!!!This was SAT Oct 28 at 8 20 pm"}
{"text":"Zaxby's is my favorite fast food chain in Charlotte and this location happens to be right down the street from me. The food is always made fresh here so plan on waiting a little bit to get your order. I always opt for the grilled chicken Cobb salad. It's huge! Plus the honey French dressing is delicious. It's hands down of the of best fast food salads you will ever get.   If you're feeling a little bad, get the birthday cake milkshake. It's like cake batter in your mouth. It's orgasmic. You can't go wrong with it!!!!"}
{"text":"Not from Charlotte but this Zaxby's got my appetite right!! Friendly staff, reasonable wait time for what I ordered, and they were sure to greet everyone around me as I waited. Yumm Zaxby's; Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer service (if you can even call it that) I've ever experienced. Management didn't give a crap how dissatisfied we were. No words for this place.."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Zaxbys.  If it is nearby I will go, but it is never a destination for me.  This restaurant is slower than most and I agree partially with other reviews regarding the unruly staff.  This is a regional chain and if you want something unique this isn't the place.  I usually keep it simple and get chicken fingers."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 3 times. I love their salads so I have come back. Problem is staff is rude, no one smiles, and frankly they are slow.   First time - got fried chicken instead of grilled  2nd time. It took 25 minutes while I watched people who ordered after me get their food first. Salad again  3rd time not a Caesar after I clearly asked and gave me grief chicken once again.   Don't come here. Panama down the street much better.   For $10 my salad better be right.   Stray away from this place."}
{"text":"They really deserve zero stars. I ordered 3 meals at the drive thru. Got home to find 1 meal wrong (boneless wings instead of bone-in) and 1 meal (nibbler meal) missing all together. The kicker is that I called the store and spoke with the manager. She offered 50% off of bone-in wings during my next visit. I of course declined, as there won't be a next visit, not because they screwed up my order, but because of the insult of a compensation. Manager training please!!!!"}
{"text":"Visit date 2/2/18   I had the spicy mushrooms and french fries I love the spicy mushrooms they was fresh and hot. The fries were well seasoned though they were not as fresh and hot as the mushrooms   Inside it was very clean they have a wooden tables in wooden  benches."}
{"text":"15 min. Wait for dine in, all the tables were dirty w food, trash and grease.   Stepped up to place order, was not greeted, just looked at.  Give your order and then get looked at some more.  Ok next? Can i offer anything, no up sales, they just stand there looking at you.   No lids for cups, trash all over the cup area and ketchup all over the counter.   This zaxbys needs a lot of help."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Walked in and restaurant was basically empty. There was no one behind the counter. One of the cooks in the back yelled to the cashier who was out back there were customers. And he did this twice before we were helped. Our order was out quick, but incorrect. We will likely visit again because we like Zaxby's, but don't care for the service at all."}
{"text":"Nice location. Orders seem quick and restaurant is steady but never busy. I love the fried mushrooms!"}
{"text":"Today was a good day at Zaxbys. I came at 12:30pm (lunch hour) and was a little nervous the service may be slow since I am limited on my break time. The service was quick. I went in instead of going through the drive thru due to the line but they were moving fast through the drive thru and inside. They have two cooking areas one for drive thru and one for those dinning in. This made the service very fast. The employee taking my order was great! He was attentive to those needing condiments but also made sure we were taken care of as well as we ordered. He was super friendly and patient. I got the Blu salad. It is pretty big so I usually eat it over two meals. It's $8 so it should be big! Lol. I get the Buffalo chicken with it on the side so it doesn't make my salad soggy I get it with blue cheese dressing and cucumbers instead of tomatoes. It was delicious !!!!! Love love love it. It was fresh as well and the half I ate was filling. Let me add that the ice here (random I know ) is my favorite. It's the small cubes. Love that type of ice. Overall great experience. Please keep this level of service e up Zaxbys and I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is great for the price.  But this location is ALWAYS having problems.  Tonight, the drive through computer was supposedly broken, they made everyone come inside to order.  It took almost 30 minutes to get my food.  Would give one star but I know I'll still enjoy the chicken."}
{"text":"It's just another Zaxby's with horribly slow service. Rude and inconsiderate staff. None of them at any of the Zaxby seem to have any kind of customer service. They don't smile, they are not polite, and frankly should not be working in food service. The food took over 20 minutes to come out of the kitchen and I was one of the only orders they produced in the 20 minutes. Getting extremely tired of the crappy Zaxby's experience. No matter how many times you call the survey line or call corporate they just keep putting up restaurants that deliver the same bad experience over and over again. Eventually they will go out of business and the world will be a better place. Here's to all the independent Zaxby's owners I hope you fail, you deserve it."}
{"text":"25 minutes waiting in the drive through. Piss poor service! I will not be back to this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"If I give 0 I would ...I've been to this location 3X and every time has been at least 30-40 mins just to get my food ....I walked in today and was told there was a 35 min wait to get food ...are they making on French fry at time in there...unacceptable service ...I'm not sure who is running this place but they need to get it together!!!"}
{"text":"Oh How I love Zaxbys. I wish they were come to Ohio. This is hands down my favorite place. I went in and ordered the fried chicken salads, the big zax snack meal, and the Wings and Things meal. Went through the drive-thru, the staff was friendly and welcoming. The cost was worth my purchase.  The big zax snack meal was great. The fries were the crinkly fries with seasoning, very fresh and tasty. The zax sauce really compliments the tenders and makes it very enjoyable. I love the fried chicken salad with onions and the Texas toast. It's one of my favorite salads.  I love this place and their menu options. I will definitely return to this location and other locations. They also have rewards program where they stamp your cards when you order a meals."}
{"text":"The Buffalo chicken fingers with a side of onion rings are Beyond marvelous, especially dipped in a spicy sauce.... Last time I was here it was 23 degrees out, but hay, not today, 65 sweating degrees while licking my fingers to their spicy dipping sauce. You might as well have a large onion rings , you deserve it....Dip the onion rings too!!!"}
{"text":"We've been to this location about 4 times, and have never had an issue.  Grand opening day was a bit slow, and the food was just ok, but it seems like the flavor issue has been worked out and everything is delicious!  Not sure what all the complaints are about since we have never had an issue with an order, but maybe it's because we only use the drive through?  The nibblerz are great (as are all the chicken sandwiches!), the cookies are fantastic, and the milkshakes are so heavenly!  Why am I not living in their kitchen?"}
{"text":"This location is always in a rush it seems! I always ask for my wings WELL DONE which means COOKED ALL THE WAY & still come home to mushy wings. Tip: if the drive thru is long they're rushing."}
{"text":"The slowest fast food in the world. I keep trying to give them a chance and they get worse. I highly do not eating at this location."}
{"text":"I visited this location on Wednesday, November 8th at around 3:00 pm on my lunch break. I got in line at the drive thru and noticed in front of me that an employee had come out to the speaker where the car right in front of me was waiting. She taped a sign to the speaker but I couldn't read it at the time. She started yelling into the speaker \"hey, hey I know you can f**king hear me\". I'm no saint but I thought that was highly inappropriate to say in front of customers. I heard the man at the speaker finally place his order and drive to the window. When I got to the speaker I saw that the sign said to come inside to order because their headsets were broken even though I heard the man in front of me place his order on the speaker somehow. I totally understand things happen but what made me a little upset was the fact that first of all, I waited in line and wasted almost 15 mins of my lunch break and left with nothing. Second of all, the foul mouth employee that taped the sign to the speaker just left a whole line of people waiting that couldn't see the sign when she very easily could have done the courteous thing and told them so they could carry on with their days. Also I need to note that this is not a drive thru you can just pull away from if you get tired of waiting. Once you are in line you are stuck because their is a tall curb on each side of you. That is the only reason I waited so long. I used to eat here once a week but I will not be back because of this one bad experience. It's too bad because the food is actually pretty good! That's why I at least gave 2 stars."}
{"text":"This Zaxby's location has gotten a bad rep over the years but lately every time I go the service is excellent and the food is nice and hot. I can't complain at all about my experience. I made 2 visits with IG 2 hours to this location and they got all of my orders correct. On my second visit I was asked \"is everything ok? Weren't you here earlier?\" The young lady wanted to make sure I did not return because something was wrong with my first order. I thought that was very attentive and the face that she remembered me spoke huge to her attention to detail. We will continue to visit so long as they keep on doing good."}
{"text":"Can't go since there is not one Near me. Or close to my job. You guys should build a Zaxbys near Red Ventures we have a whole line of people craving it daily. Please built one near us in Fort Mill. The only one in Fort Mill is 18 min away. Please hear our cry for this beautiful chicken!!!"}
{"text":"I felt like Teriyaki Wings so we went to Zaxby's since I love their teriyaki wings. I had the teriyaki wings with seasoned fries and Texas Toast. My husband had a chicken sandwich with seasoned fries and Texas toast. We enjoyed our food, but they were a bit stingy with the teriyaki sauce on my wings. Usually they're nice and saucy, but not this time. I still liked them though. Maybe next time they'll be more liberal with the sauce."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for teriyaki wings I go to Zaxby's. They're so tasty, and I love their fries. I think there's some sort of seasoning on them. They're delicious!! Especially when you dip them in that ranch dressing they give you. Ooohhh!! My only issue is they've been a little stingy with the teriyaki sauce lately. They used to be bathed in the sauce, yet still crispy. Amazing!! But now it's like they've cut back on the sauce. Maybe it's just a coincidence, but this has been the case the last couple of times I've gone there. And this was after I informed the waitress of my preference and was assured they'd give me enough sauce. If they change that sauce issue, and do a better job tidying up the restaurant (I HATE walking on a sticky floor!), then they'd receive a 4 to 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I was driving by on my way back to work and thought I would try them out. The drive thru employee was very nice and helpful. The food came out quickly. The tenders were average but everything else was not that good. The ranch tasted like bottled ranch, the fries were just basic crinkle cut with minimal seasoning, there was a piece of toast with no butter or flavor, and lastly the slaw smelled and tasted out of date and was immediately tossed. I would much rather just make take the extra time and go to Tenders a mile down the road. They are much better."}
{"text":"Pulled up at 9:55 tonight and was told they were closed (hours say they close at 10). Granted it was late but we were at the drive through in operating hours. To make matters worse, once we were leaving (without food) the employees flipped us off out the window."}
{"text":"Ordered cheese bites instead of fries... got fries  Ordered no ice in my drink... got a cup of ice with a sip of drink The sandwich I ordered looked like it'd been run over by a truck"}
{"text":"I love zaxbys but this one falls flat. The staff are usually yelling at one another about orders. The cashier is extremely slow and tries to multitask but cannot. She was asking what is my order while getting food for another client, while speaking to another client. I became aggravated bc she was getting my ordered confused. Prob won't be back"}
{"text":"If there is one fast food chain I took for granted when I lived in the South it was this place. Now that I'm a West Coast girl I realize just how special you are. Oh Zaxby's how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.   1. Chicken Strips-The chicken is fried to perfection with a crispy crunchy coating while still being moist and juicy inside. You must use wizardry in the kitchen.  2. Crinkle Cut Fries- Light and airy on the inside, crispy & well seasoned on the outside. What year did the cooks graduate from Hogwarts? 3. Texas Toast- I swore off bread over 10 years ago, but this thick buttery slice of heaven makes me throw my beliefs right out the window.  4.Condiments- As if missing the food isn't hard enough I get thoughts of Zax sauce, ranch dressing,  hot honey mustard dancing through my head. They should start a 12 step program for people forced to live without their ranch.  5. Sweet tea- Last but not least, the tea. A sweet hummingbird nectar poured over uniformed crushed perfect for chewing after gorging yourself on the bounty that is a combo.   Also the appetizers, salads,& shakes get an honorable mention. They are all delicious.  Ps-if anyone in charge ever reads this, please expand to Las Vegas. The closest one is 2 1/2 hours away. I already checked."}
{"text":"Zaxby's holds high value in my list of great fast-food places.  Sometimes, I just want something to make my tongue sweat, and that's when I go for a Kickin' Chicken Sandwich! The ingredients are consistently of high-quality; real chicken, freshly made, and made to order.  The sauces they use are one-of-a-kind, ranging from Wimpy (super mild) to Insane (slap-yo-momma HOT!!).  The fries are krinkle-cut to ensure maximum flavor-ablitiy from their fry seasoning or the optional Zax's Sauce ($.25 extra!).  They offer quite a few delicious sides, such as fried pickles and fried mushrooms.  Both rock the socks off your taste buds.   Zaxby's is a nice departure from your run-of-the-mill fast food stops.  Their drive thru window is surprisingly fast for a made-to-order joint!  Great tastes, fast service, consistent quality. Noosh!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest Zaxby's in Charlotte. The food is hardly fresh and they always are having some kind of issue. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"If I had to eat fast food I would choose this one out of all of them.. Their salads are good, chicken tenders are 3 outta 5 sauces are ok... Fast food is fast food but they do it a little better."}
{"text":"I've heard of this place for quite some time, but never had the urge or desire to try them. I guess my question is, HOW have they managed to stay in business for this long with such shitty customer service and subpar food? Their workers seem brain dead and make no effort to provide the customer with good, friendly service. Do yourself a favor and go to Chick-Fil-A instead."}
{"text":"The food is delicious & there is much variety. They also have an eclectic menu. My children love their food! Good customer service and we receive food in a timely manner as well. Good job Zaxby's!"}
{"text":"Long drive thru wait. 15 minuets +. I ordered my son a chicken sandwich plain but it came with mayo, lettuce, and tomato. I love their ice though!"}
{"text":"C'mon friends- this is fast food, and in Harrisburg we don't have a plethora of options!  If you need something quick- or a drive-thru because you have kids in tow, this is a great place to grab some lunch or dinner.  I would say it's comparable to any other Zaxby's I've been to- it's a fast food chicken restaurant.  My favorite thing to get here is the Buffalo Blue salad with grilled chicken.  It's a good size, especially if you order in.  If you take it to go, it is smaller, but a decent size.  Even my husband who has a HUGE appetite can be filled up by this.  Yes, it's fast food- so don't expect white glove service!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Zaxby's five times now and the one thing I can say is they are consistent.   5 out of 5 times I've had to wait an unreasonable amount of time for my food.  Today it was 20 minutes.  Last time 15 minutes and never less than 10 minutes.  And 4 out of 5 times this Zaxby's has been out of items. Not menu items but things a restaurant should never run out of.  Today it was ketchup.  Seriously, this is a fried food restaurant and you're out of ketchup?   Last time you were out of the little portion cups the ketchup goes in.  The time before it was plastic forks.  Before that it was ice.  But one thing I did get with my order today was a long black hair on my drink cup.   The lady behind the counter really needs to wear a hairnet.   The food at this Zaxby's is not good.  The chicken tenders are always overlooked.  The fries were not fresh and the coleslaw is dry (probably old.) I've been to several other Zaxby's in the area  (I wrote a 5 star review for the one in Monroe) so I know what the food is supposed to taste like and this isn't it.  It's obvious this restaurant is poorly, poorly managed.  Management, If you want me to try this location again message me after you've fixed the problems and I'll be happy to give it another try.  Otherwise I'm finished hoping this location will improve."}
{"text":"First time here.   Had chicken tenders, fries and slaw.   Very good.  Clerk at the counter was friendly and helpful.   Their Zamby's sauce is surprisingly hot. Definitely try it if you like heat. My only suggestion is I wish they had malt vinegar."}
{"text":"Dissatisfied customer. When you ask for specific type of chicken... (GRILLED) and they provide you with what they want you to have  (FRIED)... Frustrated with no time to complain or exchange! I will NOT be returning to this location until they know how to read the orders given to them!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, horrible customer service.  After ordering my Buffalo Blue Zalad and Spicy Fried Mushrooms the two employees and manager at the window decided to ignore me as I continued to sit at the drive-thru window waiting to request ranch sauce instead of Zestable for my mushrooms. I sat for 10 minutes until another customer pulled up behind me. At this point I turned my car off as the staff deliberately ignored me. One of the employees finally opened the window and asked me what I needed. Next time I'll remember to ask for my sauce while at the drive-thru speaker. If I come back to this Zaxby's that is."}
{"text":"Slow service, waited 15 mins for cold fries with no flavor... $16 for two sandwich meals? I got played, employees seemed very unhappy"}
{"text":"THE WORST Zaxby's restaurant I have ever been to! I don't know who is running it but it never gets any better! As Simon mentioned the Zalads are prepared half the size as what is expected for $9. I mean come on, how hard is your job if you can't even put the right amount of lettuce in a SALAD? And though they are SLOOOOOWWWW, i went back several times. Each time was a horrible experience. Chicken that tasted like it had been under a heat lamp for 6 hours, being charged $0.25 cents per extra sauce just for them to forget to give it to you. And as both reviews said.... They are never busy! Can't imagine why they fail so badly!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant several times in the past few months and always order pretty much the exact same items. Each time I ask for my fries to be cooked well done because I do not like eating soggy fries. Tonight, May 17th. I ordered a Nibbler meal and ask for my fries or we could extra crispy with extra seasoning. Has become par for the course my fries were not only sake but at best room temperature and had little to no seasoning on them. I am completely done with this fresh fine do not waste your time money or effort to eat this place is food. While the service they either can't cook crispy fries or refuse to honor your request either way they do not deserve mine or anyone else's business."}
{"text":"Gave this location a second chance. BIG MISTAKE!!! While employees where friendly for some reason, poor training or just don't care, the can't get orders correct! How freaking hard is it to get fries cooked extra crispy?"}
{"text":"Take out always easy with quick correct drive thru service. Love having the option to order online for larger orders. Great bbq sauce!"}
{"text":"I go here often as it's down the street from work and it's just simple and common sense to stop here since it's literally right there. It's a big hit and miss here, either it's completely slammed or it's completely empty. When it's empty it's fast and quick in and out. When it's slammed it takes FOREVER and I mean FOREVER. It's kind of dumb only having 2 registers open and that's it. I believe there should be another one or so but what do I technically know.   As for the food it's alright I can't complain about it too much, the only bad thing is for some reason on certain days the food may tend to be cold. But a majority of the time everything's perfectly good. Although they are super cheap on the fries and I mean you hardly get anything big thumbs down for that.   Reminder extra sauce is 25¢ or you can trade in that nasty zax sauce for something different."}
{"text":"Typical Zaxbys. The drive threw line is always long but it's faster then going inside. If you go in you'll be waiting forever..."}
{"text":"These people are probably the rudest I've encountered in the service entry. The location is convenient but that's about it. They yell through the drive thru mic and you can here the conversations in the background as they talk about the customers. They close their kitchen well before closing time and would refuse to serve you. I'm actually happy that I didn't get served as I'm sure these are the type of workers who would spit in your food."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several different locations and this one is a trainwreck. The food is terrible. I have no idea how chain food can taste THAT different from the other restaurants, but it's not even close. The fries were literally burned to a crisp. I called to complain and whoever answered the phone said \"So?\". There's a McDonald's right up the street where the employees are super friendly (and the food is edible). I just go there instead."}
{"text":"It really hurts me to write this review bc I hate writing negative reviews but this place is awful. Always super slow, drive thru is always so backed up its blocking the parking lot, have never waited in line inside for less than 15 minutes. Employees always seem uninterested and kind of rude. Today, my fries and wings both tasted like burnt plastic. Not a good time. BUT the manager was super nice and gave us free cookies and replaced our chicken. So that is a plus."}
{"text":"The food is good but it is always takes forever to either order or get my food. Every time.  Update: removing another start since the quality of the chicken has really gone down."}
{"text":"Well.... I rarely review \"chain\" restaurants but I'm making an exception here. I did come later at night but it wasn't too busy and the service was prompt. That's where the good times ended.  I ordered the 5 piece plate. What I got was the 5 piece of shriveled up dry micro-tenders. Nine bucks for some of the saddest, driest \"tenders\" I have ever had the misfortune of consuming. I mean... like Nazi's looking into the Ark of the Covenant \"dry!\" They tasted like they had been sitting around for a couple of hours on a warming lamp. When I asked for ketchup, first I got a \"look\" like Basil Fawlty would give to an annoying guest then I got 2...TWO ketchup packets. With my double order of fries I guess she figured two packets would be enough!  I eat at Zaxbys regularly (not this location) but may consider changing it up to Cane's for a while."}
{"text":"I was disappointed at lunch today. My brioche bun was definitely not brioche but a soggy hamburger bun which made the entire sandwich taste gross.  I'm giving it 3 stars though because the sandwich we had the other day on Texas Toast was great!  I know they're new so I'll give it some time and hopefully they'll get to where they should be and work out those kinks."}
{"text":"No cars in lot should have warned me, but no....I ordered chicken fingers with sauce on the side. Got home and no sauce. The pasta salad consisted of about a dozen pieces of pasta.....no dressing, no anything else. They earned that empty parking lot!"}
{"text":"Not likely to return and will not recommend. Take out order just was not good. I understand traveling home with food the temperature will drop during the two mile drive however completely cold and mushy is another story."}
{"text":"Always have a great experience at this location. Food is always fresh and they are super quick! Service is normal. Nothing that goes above or beyond but it's not terrible either.  I will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Visited on June 29th.  Could not find a clean table, soft drink area was dirty and strew with depris, floor hadn't been swept for a long time, littered with food, napkins.   Will never go back!"}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing experience I've ever had with zaxbys. After ordering and paying, in the drive through, I was asked to pull around. I waited OVER 15 minutes before walking in. After entering the establishment I was asked to continue to wait. Ultimately after receiving my refund all I left with was a bad experience. I did not enjoy my customer service at this location."}
{"text":"The worst Zaxby's. The drive through cannot get the order right. Time #1) gave our food to someone else, charged us for someone else's order, couldn't figure out how to refund a credit card, couldn't count high enough to figure out how much change to give us, I had to tell them. Time #2, told us at 9pm they had to cook more chicken fingers and to park in a handicap space and they'd bring them out. 15 minutes later I went in to find out what was going on. Guess what--they had given our order to someone else. Had to remake it. Then left it sitting there on the counter while I was waiting. Other Zaxby's are better than this. I would love to support a Mint Hill business...especially one that's open late at night...but I will never go back here again."}
{"text":"I go to this Zaxbys during lunchtime. The food is great but the reason I give 3 stars is because the wait time is crazy if you go between 12-2pm. I have learned to order online and then just pick it up to go but I see many people who get frustrated because the wait times are so long.   The employees are friendly and are trying to do the best they can. They either have a lot of catering orders they are trying to fill or the food just can't cook fast enough for the demand.   Tip: Order online if you can!"}
{"text":"Located in Concord, NC. This is chain that is sprinkled mostly in Southern states. A fast food chicken place, with a drive thru window. The service was good and the food was fair. I have to admit that salad had fresher lettuce than most. Which is a plus, when you are tired of seeing brown lettuce. The Texas toast was a bit on the limp side, not the toasty side. They serve on real dishes, that are almost too big for the small tables. They have plastic forks, but absolutely no plastic knives. So if that piece of chicken or lettuce is too big, you are fighting with the plastic fork to cut it. If you want fast food and are tired of burgers, then this is worth trying."}
{"text":"Yesterday was our second time to this place....wonderful. Friendly staff, quick service great food. Chicken tenders, fries, slaw Texas toast...all excellent. Also got a side salad, $1.39 what a deal with good ingredients. Wish they was one on south charlotte Ballantyne area....  Hello Zaxbys good bye Chcik fil-a"}
{"text":"My order did not come out correctly and the staff immediately went to work to correct it. I was told to sit back down while they corrected the order. Within 2 minutes my food was corrected and brought to my table! They apologized multiple times! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've given this location a chance many times and this place just can't ever get the food right. It's really the worst Zaxby's to go to. The fries are always cold, stale, and bland. The wings are nasty. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Ms. Annie is the sweetest lady! She brightens my day whenever I stop by. On the food side, mix the ranch sauce with the sweet & spicy sauce.. Do it!"}
{"text":"This wasn't my first time here.  I have a love/hate opinion of this place,  Let's start with the good.  The place is clean.  The dining are is always well kept.  This place has a sanitation grade of 100.0!  The service is fast.  Their shakes are wonderful.  I enjoy their fries.  Their salads are good.    The downside.  Their grilled chicken isn't great.  For the price Chick Fil A is a better deal.  The policy of charging for a sauce pack is stupid.  They should gladly provide you with dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Love Zaxby's. The Blue Zalad is the best and it is freaking huge. It is probably triple the size of the average fast food salad and only cost $6.50. It is always fresh and it's so big I can barely eat it all, my wife can barely eat half. You can get it with buffalo chicken or blackened chicken and comes with texas toast. The rest of their food is great too, but I am stuck on the salads (or Zalads)."}
{"text":"I always feel like no matter what I order or what time I go it's always \"left over\" food. It's never hot, or crispy which is unusual for Zaxbys. Any other location I have been too it has been excellent. Maybe it's a management issue? Maybe it's an employee issue? Whatever the issue is, I wish they would fix it. Highly disappointed with this location."}
{"text":"Needed party platters quickly, the did a great job advising on what to order and how much. Fed 15 people and they all loved it!!"}
{"text":"Thursday night dinner at Zaxby's! Food was great but the customer relationship is horrible! We did not finish our salad and were told that we could not get a to go container because they were too expensive!!!!! We asked for the manager. Randolph was on duty and approached the counter without introducing himself or wearing a name badge. We explained the concern to him and his response - \"most people finish their salads!\"  We offered to play for the container because the one given was too small! If most people finish their salads were is the cost of giving the container to a customer that purchased the salad? Beware and if you order a salad to eat in - get it \"to go\" so you have the container!!!!! Ridiculous Customer Relationship and Logic for a restaurant in this area!"}
{"text":"Possibly the slowest service on earth. There's no reason the drive thru should take as long as it does here. I truly hope the owner decides to fix this because it's ridiculous! It took 10 min to order, we paid and still waited about 15 min to receive our food. If your looking for \"FAST FOOD\", don't waste your time at this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered the wings and things with the teriyaki sauce.  The toast they give you was meh.  The fries were lovely and crispy.  The traditional wings were also good, but talk about sauce overkill.  I loved their boneless wings.  It was so tender and juicy and crispy.    Their sweet tea is also really good.  And the ice is basically the best ice ever."}
{"text":"I ordered food with my frequents and when we got him it was all old and burned. I returned it to the store and the district manager was there. He replaced the food but said that of course the food was hard after I left with it and then brought it back. Did not take any responsibility. Horrible place to get food."}
{"text":"Nastiest place. Food was everywhere on the floor and the trash was overflowing. Looking how bad it was outside, I wonder what would the kitchen look like!! don't go to this place!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good zaxbys...salads are good..club basket always a favorite...pretty clean..service is consistently good"}
{"text":"The restaurant and facilities were clean. I came in with a large group. The girls at the counter didn't blink, they took all of our orders with a smile and we got our food quickly. Everything was made to Zaxby's perfection! Love it!"}
{"text":"Zaxby's is great! This is quality fast food. I their menu has many options from salads, to chicken fingers (with yummy Zax Sauce), chicken sandwiches, and chicken wings. They always get my order correct and the food is great. Some of my favorites are The Blue (buffalo chicken salad), Chicken Salad Sandwich, and the Boneless Wing Meal. They have several options of wing flavors, try them all, they are all great! Glad this place is not too far from work!"}
{"text":"Customer service is a thing of the past. If you don't expect anyone to smile, to be friendly or to even act like they give a crap that you're there, then you won't be disappointed.  The food is typical Zaxby's and I've never had a problem with the food. So I gave it two stars.   The people I've encountered working at this location are horrible. A few days ago I asked a question about the difference betwee two of their meals, and the guy looked at me for a few seconds, shook his head, shrugged his shoulders and asked me if that's what I wanted. What??? I said, \"No. I wanted an answer to my question but I guess I can't get that here.\" Then I just ordered one of the meals.  That's the level of customer service all too common these days, and this Zaxby's does indifference well."}
{"text":"Today I stopped by here after work I haven't had fast food in about two weeks so I was craving some Zaxby's. I walked inside and no one came to take my order. I waited, moved to the other register and still no one came to take my order. A guy wearing a headset looked at me I don't know if he was running the drive-through as well but he didn't make any comments, he didn't say I'll be with you in just a moment or anything. I ended up just walking out without my Zaxby's."}
{"text":"This is newer Zaxby's down the street from Carowinds.  Inside it's a large space with various types of seating including booths and long high top tables.   It wasn't busy but there seemed to be more employees than customers there and one employee wandering around aimlessly.  Seemed to always be going where I was.  The food is consistent with any other Zaxbys.  Good wings, chicken fingers and crinkle cut fries. They also have 2 Coke Freestyle machines but in my opinion they just slow you down trying to decide which flavor(s) to get and hoping the machine works right.  But it's nice to know this store exists. It's nice to see Zaxby's expanding with new stores around the area."}
{"text":"It's a smaller Zaxby's than many I have been in but the layout is the same.   You go up to the counter, order, they call your number when your food is ready.    The food is consistent with any other Zaxby's and I found the staff very friendly here.  The reason for the 2 stars is because of cleanliness and safety around the drink machines.  The floor was wet and yes they had a sign up for that but after sitting there for 30 minutes and going back to get my drink refilled, it seemed they could have dried up some of the excess water on the floor because there was still a puddle and i went through it and almost fell on my butt.  Sorry Zax, if someone else fell, you could have had a lawsuit against you.  Hopefully everyone made it out in one piece."}
{"text":"Visited on a Thursday night.  It took over 30 minutes to get a salad and some wings.  This Zaxbys is always dirty every time we go but this time, it was absolutely disgusting. The drink area was filthy, there was no ketchup or napkins, the tea was empty, and the freestyle machine was out of most of the flavors.  We notice that the freestyle here never seems to have all flavors of drinks available.   We tried to speak with the manager on duty about having to wait over 30 minutes for our food, how dirty the tables and floor were in the dining room, and about the empty drink machine flavors - she gets rude and says, \"what am I supposed to do about it? Don't you see we're busy?\" There were only four people in the entire restaurant including us (they ordered before us and were still waiting for their food) and two cars in the drive-thru.  It was almost 7 pm.  There were 6 people working. We completed the survey from our receipt and asked for a manager to call us.  We never received any response."}
{"text":"There is one constant at this restaurant.  They WILL get your order wrong.  We arrived home tonight, and found yet again, that out of 3 orders, they got one completely wrong, and the other two, which were salads were both missing the dressing.    This has been a problem with this restaurant for years.  They have no apparent supervision, so things are let go out that are wrong, with no apparent checking of the order or bags."}
{"text":"I'm new to Charlotte, NC & I live across the street from a Zaxby's!!!!! My 1st time trying Zaxby's & I got the Zaxby's Buffalo Blue salad!!!! It was soooooo good I ate the salad b4 I took a pic \o/ ~~ AND the toast was sooo buttery!!! This is definitely a spot I will visit on nights I don't have time to cook & I need a quick meal."}
{"text":"This location just can't seem to get it right. Poor management and lazy employees really show. I went there this evening and ordered a single meal. Asked for extra toast, and was charged for it (I am aware of the charge and am fine with it). However, I received no extra toast. I opened the meal to discover that not only was the toast missing, but there were hardly any fries and the tenders were all less than 3 inches long. Paid almost $7 for this meal. This isn't the first time I've been disappointed with this location. I keep giving them the benefit of the doubt, but they always come up short."}
{"text":"Don't ever come here.  This is a trap not a real Zaxbys.  Wow the service here is unbearable.  Slow.  Slow.  Slow.  I don't want to call anyone stupid, I think the people working here are smart and know two languages,  but functional English is not one of them.  I don't know who is managing this place but 20 minutes waiting for 3 orders is unacceptable.  They really need to fix this place.  Don't ever come here.  This is a trap not a real Zaxbys.  I can't post this until I get my food because they would have time to read the review on their phones as I suspect the entire staff takes plenty of time to read on their phones while getting paid by Zaxbys.  I have been to other Zaxbys and I know they aren't the fastest, on that relative scale this is the worst one I have ever been to.  I also made the mistake if having other hot food in the car,  no worries it is now cold."}
{"text":"Worst Zaxby's EVER!!! Stay away. So, I ordered the 3 finger combo with extra crispy fries. Easiest order ever. I was there early for lunch, no other customers. So, the chicken was cold, the fries were raw, they charged me for extra sauce that I didn't order. They have always screwed up my orders and this time was the last straw! I confronted the manager and he did not care one bit that the moron at the front counter was incompetent. He did not care that I wasted my lunch hour and got no food since they threw my order away. He should've made me new food and given me my money back. I was not happy one bit. Do yourself a favor and eat anywhere else, just not here. Terrible."}
{"text":"I will echo other reviews that when I used to live across from here my order was frequently incorrect. However, I haven't received an incorrect order from them in a while. Perhaps it is Murphy's Law that if I don't check my order something will be wrong but now that I check  my order each time everything is in line?  My order is basically the same every single time. Boneless chicken wings with tongue torch sauce (or nuclear if I want my sinuses cleared up). A side or appetizer portion of the fried white cheddar bites with ranch instead of marinara. In the past that was the most frequent error - the staff did not realize I am a weirdo who loves ranch and they give me marinara instead. I have, more than once, received the boneless wing meal deal and paid the single order of boneless wings so at least the errors are occasionally in my favor!   The restaurant is clean, they offer an order ahead function and are generally pretty speedy for those of us who are early lunch eaters. I am sure the rest of their food is good too but they are a great spot for speedy wings and the fried white cheddar bites are amazing fried cheesy goodness. Just don't ever look at the nutritional information for them it is better not to know."}
{"text":"Zaxby's is by far, one of the best casual restaurants ever. Definitely alot better than Chick-fil-A! Their food can be a little pricey if you have more than two people ordering, but the quality makes up for it. Even though there is a wait, it's not long at all. But I'd much rather wait for good, fresh food, than greasy and fattening food. What's also good is if you're a Family Dollar employee, just show them your ID badge, and you get a discount. I get excited every time I go eat here."}
{"text":"Over twenty minutes to get a family pack, AND they tried to short us part of our meal.  What's the big deal; you just have to cook a few more tenders.  This place must be horribly unorganized because there were few people at the store, even fewer in the drive-thru, and it STILL took them over twenty minutes to fix a family pack.  They shoved the food at my husband as he was walking in to get a full refund.  And the tenders were so small you could eat them in two bites.  Not worth the money and not worth the effort."}
{"text":"The worst Zaxby experience ever. The new building was gorgeous. Awesome design and finish. My order was \"for here\", 10 pc  Chicken Fingerz, blue cheese and medium slaw. She handed me a tiny cup of slaw(like in a tarter sauce cup) and said that's it. I said I don't think that's it. 5 mins later and after much dialog she brought the correct one. Ice tea - the lemon container in drink area was empty- the area was trashed, including a caution when wet sign that was on the floor fallen down in front of drink area that you had to step over to dispense drinks. After another 5 mins the called number 14 and sat a to go box on the counter. They continued to call \"14\". After another 5 mins. She asked me what was my number? I said 17. Another few mins past. She asked me what I had had. I told her. She discovered that the to go order was in fact my chicken and handed it to me. I said I'm eating here. She handed it back to the kitchen. 2 mins later she hand it to me. I go sit down and discover its ranch no bc so I walk up to counter and ask for blue cheese. They hand me one pack. I am so over interacting with the employees I just go sit down and try to eat. The floor was filthy. Many tables had trash and had not been bussed. As I left I counted 2 employees in booths eating and 4 standing on the customer side of the counter, 3 of which were texting or on their cells. There were 3 customers in the store during this experience so being slammed is not an excuse!!  Never again. I swear!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Great coke and the portion size is great fit the money, but the food is bland."}
{"text":"This is my local Zaxby's, so I come here often. The service is hit or miss. The food is cooked to order so I expect to wait but sometimes its a really long wait. The chicken is good so I will be back but I don't think that has to do with the cooks, its just zaxby's food in general is good. Also the white cheddar bites are banging.  Get those ASAP. I sometimes just o for those and don't get chicken. If they can get the service here right, it would be a great place to dine in."}
{"text":"My all-time favorite fast food indulgence!  The Zalads (zacks + salad) are super delicious. They are filled with fresh ingredients and there are several different types (house, asian, bbq/buff /fried or grilled chicken)   I also enjoy the chicken finger plate which comes with yummy cole-slaw, seasoned crinkle cut fries, Texas toast and zacks sauce (mmm). The quality out does any other chain fast food Ive ever had. It can be slightly pricier ~ $7-10 depending on if you get a beverage. I also like that they serve coke-zero.   This location can get pretty packed come lunch time so budget in a few extra minutes.   Just a note the ONLY thing Ive ever had that was sub-par were the Buffalo wings - being from Buffalo and not having Franks Red Hot Sauce makes me a picky wing person so I focus on the other things- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"They have the good ice. I like to get the Fried (so what) House Zalad with Med. dressing. I have an idea for a list now... :)  Parking lot is easy to get in and out of. The fries are amazing but be sure to ask for \"lightly seasoned\"...too much seasoning salt and you'll forget you're eating fries."}
{"text":"I love their sweet tea and the ice. The chicken salad with ranch and tong torch is the bomb to me. Get it all the time. Haven't dined in only drive thru."}
{"text":"I almost feel bad for this Zaxby's. In general, Zaxby's has excellent chicken. And the buttered Texas toast = to die for. But don't come here during lunch time on a weekday. You will burn your entire lunch hour waiting around. It was a true cluster when I decided to chance my lunch hour here and there were several unhappy visitors waiting to order, then waiting for their food. It was as if they had just completely stopped making food entirely.  Lunch time aside, dinner or some other unusual time would be perfect for stopping in for a bit to eat. The staff is very friendly and helpful even if the management has a serious need to plan more manning during the lunch rush. If you're in here wanting a slightly better-for-you option they do have several salads (\"zalads\") with either grilled or fried chicken. But beware, even the salads pack a serious amount of calories. A bonus for this Zaxby's is that I quite like the interior décor - lots of wood detail and old style bulb signs proclaiming that you enjoy your time eating here.  Long story short, do give this Zaxby's a shot but not for lunch."}
{"text":"I don't typically get Zaxby's. It can be a bit pricey for what I consider on the same level as fast food. But the value for your money is on point. They have some excellent chicken here. Add the Zax sauce and you've got something pretty awesome I think.  I usually get the \"Zalads\" to make myself feel better about eating fried chicken. If not that, the good ol' plate of chicken fingers, fries and such makes for a filling meal that you will regret in due time.  As far as service goes, I'm sure I echo the sentiments of previous reviewers and generally any fast food patron that it sucks. I don't expect much from high schoolers taking my money and handing me some food. I'm also not a fan of the blatant Christian-leaning bias of most Zaxby's restaurants. But I guess it appeals to their standard clientele. I don't mind it - I'm not going to stop going because of it. After this review I'm actually kinda craving some of their chicken right now..."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Zaxby's. This location is closest to my home base.  The food and shakes are always very good. The salads also are plentiful and tasty.  I haven't been inside this location ... So, the dropping of rating is due to the fact that it usually takes a long time to get the order from the drive-thru. If they could ever figure that out, it would be a top notch facility."}
{"text":"So it would appear that I am not a fan of Zaxby's, for a number of reasons.  First and foremost is the food. You see, I really don't get why people make a sandwich and put something on the sandwich that is difficult to eat. For instance, chicken strips. They fall out all over the place. Why not use a chicken breast? Sure, I get that it means you can use the strips as both individual tenders and also on a sandwich, but is it really saving that much money? I hope they are, because the experience is horrible.  Second is the wait. Tom Petty said it best, and I get that you don't want to be associated with the term \"fast food\", but let's be real here: You are ordering at a counter and standing around. Don't fool yourself - it's fast food. If you sit down and someone takes your order, I might give a pass. But otherwise, waiting something like fifteen minutes from the time you order until your chicken sandwich (and that's really all we're looking at) is delivered is far too long.  Third is the service. While there is a lovely lady who seems to be a manager, and it's the only reason they get a second star, everyone else seems like they are serving in the pits of hades, and they have no problem passing it along to everyone else who comes in. I can't really blame them, because I might do the same - but frankly, it makes a bad situation that much worse.  Fourth is the branding, but this is really a personal thing. I don't care for eThis or iThat or starting words with z or adding z to the end or sticking z in the middle, just because you think it's cute. But if you're going to do it, be consistent. Not clear? Across the street is Dunwellz, and they end about everything with z, because Dunwellz ends with z. Make sense? Zaxby's does something similar, only they do so haphazardly.  For instance: Since Zaxby's starts with z, perhaps they would then start things with z. Want a \"swig\" of tea? Nope, you want a \"zwig\" of tea. Yea, that's a stupid word, but they did it. How about a picture with their product? Yep, that's a \"zelfie\". The thing with lettuce? It's a \"zalad\". Okay, I can deal with that. Want the part of your meal that comes first? It's a \"zappetizer\". That's just a little strange.  But what if you want something to add to your meal? Why \"sauce\" and not \"zauce\"? No idea, and therefore no consistency (or conziztency, perhaps). And you can of course get chicken fingerz, which shows they use the z at both the beginning and the end of words. They also have \"meal dealz\", but wings, which use \"s\" while the aforementioned fingerz use \"z\" - go figure. Even in the same package, such as \"wings & fingerz\".  And when it comes to that sauce - you can get extra sauce (for a quarter each), and like most places, you can get ketchup and mustard at the drink bar, but they have no hot sauce, at least without getting sauce. Some sriracha, tabasco or texas pete would make for a nice addition.  But hey, at least the place was clean."}
{"text":"Why do I torture myself by giving places another chance? Because it's another location, that's why. And I had an unused balance on a gift card, so at least the meal was free. Except for $0.18 cents or so.  While I thought perhaps the Mint Hill Zax was an oddity, because someone has to like their meals, since they are building all these locations, I'd give it another shot. So I tried the newest location, on Albermarle. Turns out that things were almost identical.  I again ordered a sandwich, but this time went with the non-fried variety, since last time a \"sandwich\" was in fact just a couple of chicken tenders, and tenders do not make a good sandwich - too many pieces falling out all over the place. This time, however, the grilled variety should yield better results, right? Wrong. the chicken breast was cut into pieces. On a sandwich. Are you freaking kidding me? Who does that?  Should I yield a guess, it's someone who took a breast, cut it up into pieces for another order - maybe a salad, where you would want pieces instead of one large chunk, and realized \"whoops, this is a sandwich\", and proceeded to put it on the bun. What's worse is that, just like the other location, it took more than ten minutes to get the order. Why does it take them so long to prepare an order, and why is it so disappointing when you get it, with pieces falling out all over the place?"}
{"text":"This is a decent location but inconsistent. There are times where drive thru is really quick and times where it is very slow even if there is just one car in front of you.   First time- I got the anniversary special and it was great. Chicken was hot and fresh. Bread and fries were on point. Second time- Service was slow. I asked for an extra sauce when I was putting in my order and never got it. French fries were soggy and the chicken had a lot of breading on it.  Overall, it's ok."}
{"text":"I should of read the reviews first!! Literally the slowest zaxbys I've ever been to. I came in around 11am on a weekday. There was only one person in front of me inside. I saw two ladies waiting by the table on their food and I could already tell they were waiting for a while. I ordered my food-wings and things with fries and a sweet tea. Simple right? Nah. Five people ordered after me and they all got their food before me. Finally I went up front and the manager said they were waiting on my wings. Ok, fine. I go home and eat my food and the inside of the wings were black and pink and seriously just crumbled in pieces. Gross!! I got the right amount of chicken tenders but one was seriously the size of a nugget! Never again."}
{"text":"My son went to this Zaxby's tonight. When he got home and opened his salad it looked like a side salad with day old cold chicken on it. He called back and spoke with Kindell and she apologized and told him to come back and get another one whenever he can."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today and this was not my first visit but maybe my last for awhile. The salad in the first few Yelp pics looked nothing like what I got. Mine was way short!! The salad was good but way short for 8.00+ dollars. Zaxby's food is usually pretty good and they give you a good amount. IDK what happened this time. The stars are for the salad size. NOT THE FOOD! :-("}
{"text":"Ordered my food....stood there waiting for 20 mins while watching 6 newer customers get their food. When I asked about my order, I found out it was never made....but they took the money tho. As if I was standing there holding up the walls or something."}
{"text":"Much better than competitors! Service is great Food is great and this is fast food Forget icky bw3 and get better food here"}
{"text":"We wanted to try zaxby since couple of our friends told that their chicken is better that chick-a-fill's (caf) Last week we went to this location and decided to order the chicken finger. The chicken is just okay, not that much different than caf, some of the dipping sauces are good but the rest were just okay. What make it one star was the service. It was quite horrible. The front associate failed to explain that the extra $0.25 per chicken was actually for buying a dipping sauce for $0.25 per cup (small size). And here I thought the chicken was gonna be prepared differently by paying that extra. 1 other couple also fell into this \"trap\". On top of that, the same associate failed to count the number of cups we supposed to get and had to wait for at least 7 minutes to get our last couple of cups.  In short, ok chicken, some decent dipping sauce though not worth $0.25, and terrible service. Will not go to this location, nor to this chain of restaurant anymore"}
{"text":"Most people I know enjoy eating at Zaxby's. Not me. No sir-E. I came here and ordered some BBQ chicken wings and when I received them, they were cold. COLD! I don't enjoy luke-warm food. I definitely don't enjoy COLD food that is supposed to hot. I am not big on having  Texas Toast with my meal either. I just would much rather eat at Chik-fil-A if I need something quick."}
{"text":"If I could give less than a one star rating, I could. I love Zaxbys food and as an employee of the Charlotte Premium Outlets, I was excited that one was being built. My excitement soon dissipated after realizing that EVERY visit I received the slowest service ever. It literally took them 30 minutes to make one salad. Ive been through the drive thru, gone inside, and even called in an order 20 minutes in advanced and my food is NEVER ready in a timely manner. Not sure if it's the age of the staff (all associates and managers seem to be between the ages of 16-21) but something must be done to remedy this crude service. Also - this location should consider being open later than 10. The outlets close at 9& most of the employees don't get to leave until 930. I've gone multiple times after getting off and the service, quality and timeliness is less than stellar. Most of the employees also eat here so I know this location receives increased traffic during this last hour between 9pm and 10pm. Staying open even 30 minutes later would greatly impact the customer experience."}
{"text":"Ehhhh, had better. Actually quite disappointed with this visit. Try somewhere else.  The food was ok, better than Mcdonalds but won't go out of my way to eat here. I had the blue cheese salad with blackened chicken, and another in out group have the chicken tenders. The salad was not bad but definitely nothing special. We had never eaten at a Zaxby's so we trusted what the cashier told us about the sauce (she said go with the Zaxby sauce). So when eating the chicken tenders the other person didn't really like that sauce and decided to stick with ranch, which i volunteered to go up and get. When i asked i was told I would be charged 0.25$ for a ranch. I was never charged because the guy decided that using a charge card for 0.25$ was ridiculous, like charging for extra sauce. This is soooo ridiculous, you are alienating your customer base by doing this. I already over paid for chicken tenders and a salad, then you want me to pay 0.25$ for extra sauce since we took your advice. I could see if i came up and asked for 4 of every sauce you have for this one meal. But really..... Poor customer service, I WILL NOT BE BACK. I wish they have  a PDQ up here, if they did they would shut this place down.  Another in our group ordered boneless buffalo wings. I tried one after she took a bite and stopped eating. IF YOU LIKE VINEGAR COME HERE, These tasted like vinegar with a little bit of buffalo flavor in the background. 2 other people tried these and no one else finished the piece they have. Even when soaked in ranch these tasted liked vinegar. WORST WINGS EVER.    If your looking for chicken go to Chick Fila! They will treat you better the food is better and the atmosphere is WAY BETTER!"}
{"text":"It's a step above fast food and the menu revolves around chicken tenders.  Service was great.  It took them a little longer to make our orders and they gave us a bunch of free food to make up for it.  Friendly place and good food."}
{"text":"This place is poorly run plain and simple. Rarely get orders correct, no paper towels in the bathroom, no Minute Maid products ever in the machines. On top of that, this place is just plain dirty. I think they wipe the tables down once a day. Good food but they need to tighten up their operations."}
{"text":"Kind of bad service. Wern't very helpful. Kind of rude and I am usually a pretty patient person. Just go to the cookout across the road. It's pretty much the same food but cheaper. It would have been one thing if they were busy, but the place was empty and they still acted like I was the biggest inconvenience ever. They also got the order wrong."}
{"text":"Great salad!!! If you have egg or dairy allergies do not eat any fried chicken! Other then that it's amazing never a bad experience, the girls in the front are helpful and sweet and the food is abundant, will fill you up and then some and hello zax sauce is amazing glad we have one on this side of town."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous reviews, very nice new facility but the service was a nightmare!  The staff was unprofessional and my order was old and cold.  I ordered a chicken finger plate and the fries were cold and stale, the texas toast was cold and seemed like somone made it an hour or two prior, and my chicken fingers were cold!  Worst Zaxby's experience ever!!!  Nearly $9 for lunch and I threw it out, what a waste!  I should have went to McDonalds (Not my favorite) or Bojangles instead.  I will not be returning to this Zaxby's again and I will let all my friends know how horrible it was to save them the same  bad experience!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Zaxbys has great food and I love it as a concurrent alternative to traditional fast food. I highly recommend Zaxbys as a whole but especially this location"}
{"text":"I have had their food at other locations and was pleased, however this location was disappointing.  I took family, visiting from out of town, to a place, I thought with decent food at reasonable prices. Also they hadn't tried it before.  Tables were dirty, we cleaned them ourselves. The chicken and bread were burnt. It was difficult to even chew the chicken fingers. The fries were ok and the soda pop was in the new progressive machines (choose your own flavors from Coke)"}
{"text":"well I'm not really into fast food but during busy tentative weekdays fast food is the best choice. for sandwich, I hink Chick fill a has the best chicken, wendys has a good combo, zaxbys has an awesome bread. of course the fried chicken is amazing with chesee melting and hot spicy sauces, but considering calorie and health, I'd rather have roast or grilled. btw, fries are bit overcooked, not crispy enough though I really lov thick fries"}
{"text":"This is the worst managed restaurant I have ever visited.  I was excited when I learned that Zaxbys was coming to Mint Hill as I have had good experiences at other locations.  Now I am just disappointed.   The staff here isn't really rude they are just indifferent.  It seems as though customers are an interruption to whatever more important stuff they are doing. BTW it ain't cleaning. I don't understand how anyone expects to earn repeat business with these employees. The service is so slow that you can go to a true casual restaurant and be served better food much quicker than at this fast food place.   I guess the good news is that the word is out on the street.  Everyone I have talked to is disgusted too.  Hopefully. the next owners/managers will care about their customers."}
{"text":"I loved the upbeat music. The staff was sweet. The restaurant was clean!! We went in at 7pm on Friday and there was a bit of a line. That is not unexpected on a Friday at 7pm. We get our food...order until food arrives about 10 minutes. I thought that was fine. As we are finishing our meals, a very nice young lady came by and gave us some extra chicken strips as a thanks for the wait. I can go anywhere for chicken. What keeps me coming back is how I am treated. Yes, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I stop at this location when visiting family in Charlotte. They are zero for two with getting my order correct.   At other locations, when I have gotten what I have ordered, the food is great.  If management could get the employees here to pay more attention to detail......."}
{"text":"Why did I stop here?! I was in a hurry and I thought I could pull through the drive thru quickly to order two salads for lunch.  What a joke!  It took a long time to place my order at the drive thru even though I was able to pull up to the ordering board immediately.  So I place my order, pull up to the window and the gal at the window had me tell her my order again.  I paid for my two salads then I proceed to wait and wait and wait and WAIT!  End result was that salads were good and I guess that's why I always give Zaxby's another chance. I'm definitely not going there for their high quality service standards!"}
{"text":"Very slowwww service!!! 3 customers in the place and it still took 20 minutes to get my 4 strip order. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!!!! Dirty tables and floor, staff more interested in horsing around than keeping the place clean. I've been to many Zaxby's and this has been the absolute worst!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times, and I've never had any issues. The food is consistently good for a fast food restaurant. My order has never been wrong and I've never waited an obscene amount of time. I'm not sure why there are so many complaints about the service, but then again I don't particularly go to a fast food restaurant for the service. The service here is on par with most fast food places. You get what you pay for. They are not generally rude in my experience, but it's not five-star service either (which is fine)."}
{"text":"This is a good choice when looking for a salad in a fast food environment.  The service and cleanliness vary by location based on my experience. I did have to clean my own table (wipe down) since it had not been properly cleaned. I ordered the Buffalo Blue Chicken Zalad. It was tasty and included an abundant amount of Buffalo Sauce covered chicken. The chicken was nicely cut into bite size cubes.  Cucumbers do not come with this salad. I also had the blue cheese dressing. The salad was good and filling. Overall I belive that these locations could work cleanliness, customer service and food presentation . I gave this location 3 stars but it would be 2.5 if I could give 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I don't eat fast food often, but this is one of my go tos for a delicious grilled chicken house salad. Unfortunately, this Fort Mill location fell short of my high expectations.  Let's start with an appropriate greeting. When we walked in, the cashier immediately asked dine-in or take out? Our receipt clearly stated dine-in but yet we received to-go boxes instead of dine-in dishes. My grilled house salad didn't include all the ingredients (fried onions) and they didn't even have the courtesy to at least tell me before hand that they were out.   The drink counters were all sticky from beverage residue and our dining room table needed to be wiped off.   I've been to many Zaxby's locations in the area and this one is one of the worst."}
{"text":"Best, fresh , grilled chicken sandwiches that's why I'm giving 2stars , but what is up with the scrawny wings ? Is this really a drum, the one time I decide not to get grilled chicken I'm stuck with a deep fried, honey mustard chicken bone. It is the same size of my pinky finger -___- . My 13yr old daughter was hungry after track practice and she didn't want these. You are a chicken place right? Wings and things? Which one is the thing? I see no wings ."}
{"text":"I was worried coming here because of the negative reviews but I've found no reason for concern. My service wasn't super friendly but they weren't rude and I didn't hear any bad language. The food itself seems like average zaxby's. I will say that my experience is based on going through the drive thru but overall I've got no complaints.  Update: the only strange thing is that they put BBQ sauce on my nibblers instead of zax sauce?"}
{"text":"The service at this location is very slow and the customer service is one of the worst I ever seen at a Zaxbys fast food establishment. I waited at the drive through for 30 minutes and fries were cold and cashier had a nonchalant attitude at the  drive through."}
{"text":"Came towards the end of the night and still received quick service. Food was hot and fresh. My salad was super green and plenty of lettuce and toppings. Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Love Zaxbys food...but this particular location has gotten my order wrong time and time again. Additionally, the service time is significantly lengthy and my food has been cold."}
{"text":"This last visit was a 2. The previous a 4, so I split the difference. First visit, food and service was good.  The last was so so.. Chicken wings were Very Small and a bit chewy, and the line was so long that the guy behind us walked out! (Took forever with each customer ordering)  There was one cashier and nobody bothered opening another register. I brought my wings home and still haven't eaten them, that was 2 days ago.  My daughter has been wanting and asking if she can have them, so I'm giving them to her as we speak. I've found, in our experiences, that the later it is, the worse the customer service gets! But, Could have been an off day.."}
{"text":"First time visiting a Zaxby's. We had it \"to go\". I got the chicken fingers & my wife had the black & blue salad. The chicken fingers were good, not great. I did like the Zaxby's sauce for the chicken (I think they have different sauces for everything). Not a big fan of the crinkle cut fries. My wife's salad was really good. Nice portion size and great flavor. I'd get that again. Overall it is was an \"A-OK\"  first experience."}
{"text":"Today was my worst experience I ever dealt with today at zaxby's . My husband and I order our food literally waited 45 mins for it . When time was about 35 -40 mins I asked the cashier what is up with our food we've been waiting so long for it and our number kept getting skipped . Later the cashier didn't know how to respond back to us so all she said was it's not ready . So my husband and I decided wait a little longer finally when the manager came out my husband has asked kindly about our food because we waited so long for it . The manager had a ugly attitude with a loud tone in his voice saying \" it takes 12 mins to cook the wings and they forgot to do your order \". So me as a angry wife wasn't going to let anyone talk to my husband like that so yes I cussed the manager right back and made him apologize so after apologizing we finally get our food so when we get our food it was cold messy and disgusting to the point I didn't even wanna touch it . So my husband took a bite out his wing and guess what a raw uncooked wing . I can never ever explain how rude and dirty this place is . Never will I come back and deal with the service they had given me today . So be careful and choose wisely where you eat ."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and ordered The Blue both times. Dynamite salad with bleu cheese crumbles and blackened chicken. Friendly staff and good menu. Plenty of salad served for a good lunch or dinner. I will keep going there."}
{"text":"I ordered a Black and Bleu. They gave me some salad with breaded buffalo chicken. My wife ordered chicken strips and they gave her food that appeared and tasted old. Never have I gone to a Zaxby's and been disappointed until this one. I won't be back to this location. The only reason I gave it two stars was the help was friendly."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in this location.  I've had Zaxby's a ton of times but this location wasn't great. I ordered the salad and my lettuce was starting to turn brown. The amount of chicken was weak too. For as much as they charge for a salad and for what it is...wasn't worth it. Great location, not such great food."}
{"text":"The worst! The drive thru literally takes forever, they don't even take your order quickly and the service once you get to the window is not good either, not friendly and usually a bunch of teens.  Do better with the drive thru guys please"}
{"text":"I am a pretty frequent visitor to this restaurant and I love it...  Although they cook to order, I have never had an incredibly long wait time...  When you call in an order, it is done before you get there...  Those salads are ridiculously tasty and I love the Honey French dressing they offer...  The french fries are worth the calories... Just do it...   I used to know a lot of the staff here, but they've got a new crew... They're just as nice as the ones I remember and they always have smiles on their faces... If you're in the area and want a solid choice for delicious food, this is your place."}
{"text":"Filthy interior and slowest service I have EVER seen in a fast food restaurant. Cashiers were rude. Yelp forces a star rating to post. This is a big zero star. Won't be back."}
{"text":"When you arrive at a restaurant with less than 30 minutes before closing, you sometimes get less than quality service  and employees that wish you hadn't shown up.  Fortunately that was not the case at this Zaxby's.  Staying across the road from this location, I walked over about 9:40 and they close at 10.  They were already well into their end of night closing procedures, but I was still politely greeted at the counter.  I ordered boneless wings to go with fries and sweet tea.  It was ready with minimal waiting.  I appreciate not being felt rushed or unwelcome near closing time."}
{"text":"Zaxbys does chicken right. They offer great service and quality food to match. Inside is very nice with tons of room. Comfy booths too.   The parking lot is a disaster though. It's a one way route and people seriously don't get it. 1 entrance/exit was not good planning. When the drive thru gets backed up it makes things even worse. Plus the drive through goes through the entrance to the restaurant. It just doesn't make sense.   Anyway the food is good and they have great ice. Don't sleep on Zax sauce."}
{"text":"Love this chicken! Great salads, great sandwiches, and the chicken salad is the bomb! For a chain they do it right. The nibblers with tongue torch sauce and fries will do you in. Go!"}
{"text":"Ty Doug for tht awesome review abt my son Matthew. It really touched my heart. Things like ths build a persons self esteem. And i know it will build his, whn he sees ths. God bless u and ur wife. Maybe i will meet u both in zaxbys sometime whn Matt is working."}
{"text":"This place must treat their employees like dirt.  Never has anyone ever smiled at me in the drive through at this place.  No one is overly nasty, but they are far from nice.  It is a fairly regular occasion where they forget the little things that would provide a good customer experience.    For example today, we paid $25 for a subpar Caesar Salad and two dry Zaxby's Club meals, and they didn't bother to give us eating utensils!  On another occasion they forgot the 7th Grade Home Economics tasting, Betty Crocker, mix-brownie.  Another time we had to ask for our drinks over and over before they remembered to finally give them to us.    Oh!  And they will put half a cup of ice in every drink, so unless you just like ice, REQUEST light ice.  If you have ever gone here you know that this is a more expensive fast food place, and they really should hold themselves to a higher standard of service.  Otherwise you're throwing good money away.   The only reason I continue to frequent this overpriced establishment (with the small menu) is because hubby really likes the sandwiches here.    Regretfully, everything here is served with a free side of disappointment."}
{"text":"I went durning lunch. A lot of the tables were dirty, staff were very mediocre and the food was nothing to brag home about."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best establishments I have visited to date.  Very clean and the staff was top notch.  The chicken is very good, both grilled and breaded. I do like their affinity for Texas Toast, it goes well with the chicken.   I normally do the \"wings and things\"...but lately I have been ordering the Blue Salad with buffalo chicken, topped with blue cheese dressing.   The crisp lettus mixed with the zing from the buffalo chicken is a great mix.  The crinkle-cut fries were cooked to perfection and even better dipped in the Zaxby Sauce."}
{"text":"yuck yuck yuck. I am not sure if it was the day but why do people eat here. The fires were cold, the chiken just so so. I was not pleased. I was expecting so much from the advertizing"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. It's a new place so nice and clean. It was really busy but our food came out fast and great as always! Close to Ikea and 85!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Zaxby's plenty of times. I won't be returning anymore.  The inside is always dirty. The drive-thru is always slow. My Zalad portions are never correct or I'm missing an ingredient (I always get the Cobb- have been for years).   Skip this location for sure."}
{"text":"I had a problem with our Big Zak snacks (not hot at all). I called back in when my wife got home. I wrote the time on the receipt (which was from my cell - which I keep 10 mins early for work purposes). I returned a few days later and was nearly assassinated by the Owner's wife about the problem with the cold food. She asked WHY we didn't bring back the food. I advised her that Brent did not tell us we had to. She said they require one to do so. WTF?? She said she noticed I called back in (I believe it was about 15 or 20 mins later from receipt time). I said I called as soon as my wife got home and I noticed the food was cold. She said in the future that I would need to bring it back up there. I told her there shouldn't be a in the future. I felt like she thought I was lying.   I am confused at how individuals, franchise owners take the customers patronage for granted. I will NEVER eat at this Zaxby's ever again. Like I explained to Brent, this was the 3rd time my food was cold. The previous 2 times, I just said I wasn't going to grip. But, this time I felt it was necessary. Especially when you have the younger workers that work in the evening.  My question to the Owner's wife would be this...You wanted me to bring the food back? Were you willing to pay for my gas to bring it back up there, since it was your restaurant's fault? OR would you have eaten the cold food? It would have been a write off regardless if I bring it back that same day or I came back 3 days later without the food. Definitely a lesson learned. It's sad when you have franchise owner's that feel they can say and do anything while in ownership. But, you have to remember...you are carrying the Zaxby name and should be held to a even higher standard.  Signed A Lesson Learned  3rd time visiting and LAST!!! New Resident of Monroe"}
{"text":"We are from Colorado originally and had never heard of Zaxby's. We didn't know what to expect, but we were very pleased with our experience. For a fast food type of establishment, the quality of the food was excellent. At the last minute I decided to add on an order of fried pickles and I was so glad I did. They were amazing and the sauces that came with all the different things that we ordered were delicious. I would definitely recommend Zaxby's to anyone looking for a delicious alternative to your boring fast food options."}
{"text":"Generally a fan of Zaxbys.  This location is disorganized at best.  It has all the elements in place to be a high performer - easy location, friendly staff, and a solid franchise.  The owners need to put the right leadership in place to make this location \"feel\" right, from first to last impression."}
{"text":"Drive thru Accuracy is awful. I mean. How hard is it to listen. And if you don't understand, ask again? Keep asking for things on my order and NOT receiving them. Keep stealing money from me Zaxbys and you'll be losing a customer."}
{"text":"Never been here before.  I got a chicken finger kids meal. The chicken fingers were ok not the best I've ever had. The Zaxby's sauce was bitter to me. They said I could \"exchange\" it if I didn't like it then went to charge me 0.25 for ranch. The guy was nice enough not to when my fiancé only had a credit card to pay for it.  My mom got the wings and finger platter. The wingers were the \"wimpy\" flavor and were so vinegary that none of us could really eat then.  Overall it was OK. Don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Have you ever gotten your food, eaten it and enjoyed it, then on the way out, you see someone else is eating something and it looks better than what you had? That happened to me at Zaxby's.  I had their Zaxby's Club, which is a breaded and fried chicken breast (I don't think they have anything that's not fried) with bacon and cheese and lettuce and tomato on the most unhealthy and delicious Texas toast. With a big pile of crunchy fries. There was a pickle under there somewhere but by the time i had uncovered it, I wasn't interested. It was delicious and I ate every bite of the sandwich, mopping up a decent amount of ketchup with the tasty fries. Yum.  And then on the way to the bin to drop my tray, I saw another guest with a plate of a dozen or so wings that looked awesome. Even yummier looking than my sandwich. Next time, Zaxby's. Next time..."}
{"text":"I didn't particularly care for the food at this restaurant. It kind of tasted like they hadn't change the oil in there fryers and the chicken was overcooked. They seem to be in competition with Chick-fil-A and I will just go to Chick-fil-A when I want chicken. If it's Sunday I guess I'll just cook my own.  It didn't seem particularly clean either."}
{"text":"Good chicken place. Clean place with clean bathrooms. Was a staple of my high school lunches. Definitely has not changed which is good!"}
{"text":"Their house \"zalad\" is decent, but their customer service is seriously lacking. Their floors are dangerously slick and I have almost slipped several times."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I am from Ohio and we do not have Zaxbys. I just so happened to be going to Carowinds and I saw there was a brand new Zaxbys down the street. The ratings were bad, so I was really skeptical.  My food was fast, fresh, and absolutely delicious. My chicken fingers were nice and crispy, bread was delicious, and fries were only. My fries were a bit mushy, but I did get the food to go so that is expected.  Excellent job Zaxbys!"}
{"text":"in the last week  Tonight i was at the drive through line at 950p and they said they were closed even though they served the car in front of me. I watched 3 cars try to go through after me"}
{"text":"Definitely get your bang for your buck at this place.  I would say it falls in-between fast food and a sit-down restaurant.  I tried the Wings and Things plate and the wings were good... nice and hot.  The food did take a while to come out, but it was worth the wait.  It was a huge serving for what I paid for, so its good in that sense, but man I definitely left a little slower than normal.  I'm sure its good every once in a while, but I being stuffed like that is not my idea of a good time."}
{"text":"Zaxby's in my opinion is the best restaurant for fast food chicken, even though they don't consider their restaurants fast food.  Everything is made to order and not sitting in a heat bin for hours at a time.    Everything at Zaxby's is good.  I'm a fan particularly of their salads, their cajun chicken sandwich, their nuclear wings and their fries.  Nobody seems to do the crinkle cut fries anymore.  Oh yeah, a big plus for them is the crushed ice in the ice dispenser!"}
{"text":"There's nothing exciting at this Zaxby's except maybe it's location adjacent to an outlet mall.   Inside is rather plain and boring. Service is slowwwwwwwww here and the food isn't that great compared to other area Zaxby's. My chicken was overcooked and it was cold because it sat there too long because the place was understaffed during a lunch hour."}
{"text":"Zaxbys is always hot and fresh. We had a salad and some wings today. A cut above regular fast food. The Zax sauce on the chicken wings makes them the best wings around. I'm a fan of Zaxbys and this store, which I've eaten at since it opened, is always on its game."}
{"text":"Zaxby's is a welcome replacement at this location for the tired old Wendy's that used to be there.  All the sudden, the place is bright and clean and filled with smiling and service oriented folks working there vs. the sad sack crew that used to be at the Wendy's.   I'm not a big chicken fingers fan as they are so ubiquitous that you can get them anywhere.  But... Zaxby's does have a pretty good chicken salad sandwich and I really like their Cajun Club sandwich.  When you add in those fat crinkle cut fries, served hot and crispy with plenty of seasoned salt.... Dare I say it for a fast food place.....?  Yum."}
{"text":"I love zaxbys! This particular location can be a hit or miss on the service but the food has always been delicious for me"}
{"text":"Dear god is this place slow.  The drive thru always takes 30 minutes.  I told myself I would go inside the next time and next time I went the drive thru line was backed up and nobody was inside.  Will not be returning to this place again.  Didn't give one star because I like the chicken so much."}
