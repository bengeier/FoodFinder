{"text":"I stopped by this restuarant for lunch about a month ago. It was good, however I totally ordered the wrong things.  I was with a friend who is a vegetarian, and she ordered some empanadas and a side of potatoes.   I followed suit, ordering some beef empanadas and a side of corn cakes.   For some reason I was expecting  Spanish-style baked empanadas with more filling and less bread.  These empanadas were good, but more like deep fried and very bready.  That combined with the corn cakes was a little too much starch.  It would have been nice if the waiter had warned us of our questionable selections! But, I don't hold that against them.. it was really our own faults.   Other items on the menu looked great, though! So, next time I plan to order a proper meal, rather than an appetizer and a side...  I will post an update once I do!  I am optimistic, because I really like the atmosphere and location of the restuarant :)  Also, I should note that La Boca is  also a night life spot in the evenings..  they regularly host Tropical Rhythms salsa and tango events. I haven't been, but have gone to Tropical Rhythms events at The View and Sunset Lounge, and they're always a good time. I think LaBoca would be a cool venue because it's more casual and not as pretentious as the other two..   It's a place where I'd feel more comfortable."}

{"text":"Great atmosphere, with large windows and loads of original artwork on the walls.  The menu is large, with a variety of salads, appetizers, sandwiches, pizzas, and seafood, meat, and vegetable entrees.  There is definitely something for everybody.    They offer several types of sangria by the glass or pitcher.  I recommend the red.  The bread is served with a cute little tray of olive tapenade, hummos, and herb butter (see picture).  We also started out with the plantain and fig empanadas, lobster and crab fritters, and the mussels in chorizo broth.  The empanadas and mussels were good.  Lobster/crab fritters were nothing special.    Next we had the Fall Salad, Chimichurri Steak Sandwich, and Pan Roasted Scallops.  The sandwich was served on fresh ciabatta with  havarti cheese and grilled mushrooms.  I'd definitely order that again.  The scallop dish was not huge but it was delicious.  No room for dessert.  Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"We tried this place out with high hopes based on the menu but were overwhelmed by bad service, or rather, lack thereof.  We waited in the empty bar nearly ten minutes before a host noticed anyone had arrived, then were seated and waited more than ten more minutes without water or drinks being offered to us, so we left without ordering.  Extremely disappointed - do yourself a favor and go down the street and eat at Luxe!"}
