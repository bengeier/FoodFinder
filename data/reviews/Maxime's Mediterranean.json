{"text":"Baklava was the best i've ever had! Pita and hummus were great. Everything was really fresh and it looked clean inside. I'll definitely be coming back. The owners seemed really nice; i like to support the small businesses and not always go for the franchises. Overall great experience and very authentic!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean food ever. If grape leaves, tabbouli and falafel are what you are craving. Head here! Leila will cook you some of the best food you have ever tasted. Super fresh"}
{"text":"I was very surprised with all the good reviews. Usually yelp reviews are spot on. As a Lebanese American this place was a huge disappointment for \"descent\" Middle Eastern food!  Guess I'm spoiled with all the outstanding middle eastern restaurants in Dearborn, MI. The kafta and rice was tasteless, and the humus had way too much olive oil poured over it with very little garlic - boring. I enjoy good ethnic, family owned establishments but this place was a complete miss and pathetically overrated."}
{"text":"Wow!  Food is great!  Hummus was awesome.   Everything is fresh.  We went for lunch and it's a cute and comfortable restaurant.   Our first time there, the owner was great, she is super friendly and great services.   We plan on returning several times.  Two thumbs up on  food, taste, quality and service."}
{"text":"Hands down the best baklava I have ever had in my life. I had the chicken shawarma, it was delicious. also the special dressing on the Greek salad was  super yummy.
The owners were very kind. I can't wait to go back and try the spinach pie"}
{"text":"Good food. Meh service. The atmosphere was literally the weirdest place I have ever been to for dinner. Can't go back except maybe for carry out!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, amazing hospitality, great service,
Definitely not to miss if you are visiting Pittsburgh. Must try.  best authentic Lebanese/ middle Eastern. 
Overall excellent experience."}
{"text":"I am very surprised by the high ratings, perhap I visited on a bad day. I went in for a sit down meal and waited half an hour before anyone showed up, we actually thought the restaurant was closed. There was then a very nice and friendly lady who took our order, I believe she did the cooking and the serving on her own so the wait was not due to negligence. 

We ordered the kafta, chicken shawarma, kibbee, gyro and hummus. Hummus was pre-made, stored in a plastic container and straight out of the fridge but it tasted pretty good, even when ice cold. All the meat dishes were dry, tasteless, and luke warm. I expected lots of spices and seasonings in middle eastern food but I simply couldn't taste anything, not even salt and pepper. The chicken shawarma looked and tasted like old sliced deli chicken breast in a flat bread. 

Perhaps their take out and catering is better but I will avoid them from now on. If you want good Mediterranean sandwiches and meat plates, go to Pitaland in Brookline instead!"}
{"text":"I had the gyro and tabouli with baklava for dessert and I was very impressed!   I would highly recommend! We will be back! Also the owner is very friendly! Great service!"}
{"text":"Came to Pittsburgh for the game and stayed overnight. Wanted to try something different then tourist food.  Found this great review and was very happy I stopped by.  It was within 5 miles from the airport.  I tried the gyro and the chicken shawarma. Both were delicious. Don't leave without trying the baklava."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem!  Best Mediterranean food around.  Looks can be deceiving, but this place is phenomenal, so cheap, and the owners are the nicest people.  It's a must try, so chill and BYOB."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was fantastic...delicious food and great service. Will return for another meal next time I'm in the Pittsburgh area. Thank you Leila!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the locale. The owner puts a lot of effort in making his customers happy and it shows in his food's quality. Great choice!"}
{"text":"Such a great find, the woman running the place is so friendly and helpful. I don't remember how to spell what I got but the owner will explain the entire menu to you if necessary."}
{"text":"Well this was a pleasant surprise!  Wow so good. Me and my husband were staying with his sister for a few days and she had only tried this place for the first time a month ago and she's lived in Moon Twp. for 10 years!  I wish she had known about this place sooner. Very authentic I think is the best way to describe it. Everything was delicious. We had spinach pie, meat pie, kibbie, hummus and a chicken pita. Everything was awesome. And of course baklava for dessert which was also awesome. So, so good. There was a bit of a language barrier when ordering but it only added to the authenticity. This place is great. Oh....and cheap!!!  I was shocked at the prices. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Looooove the Service from Leila! She's so sweet and the food is great. Fresh, and the Tabbouli is the best yet!! I crave it every week!
My favorite little secret spot!"}
{"text":"Great food. Was at the Double Tree hotel down the road, wanted something authentic nearby. Wish I had found them earlier in the week! Went back the next day."}
{"text":"They have a really good food, especially the kabob sandwich and salmon plate. Also, the staff are very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday with my Daughter, since I am Syrian wanted to try!!  We were happy with the quality & authentic food & the friendly owners!!  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very friendly!!!! Craving Mediterranean food while driving to Pittsburgh International Airport. Found this listing in Yelp. It only had two reviews but decided to take a chance. We were greeted by the very friendly owner/chef Leila. She told us that she opened this Mediterranean restaurant about 4 months ago right next door to her existing sandwich shop. We started with hummus and pita bread which was really, really good. Leila says that are absolutely no preservatives in her food. We had the beef kefta sandwich and the chicken shawarma sandwich and both were fantastic. If I'm ever back this way I will definitely come back for more of the chicken shawarma. Stuck at the airport now and I wish that I would have taken Leila's advice and taken away a meet and spinach pie for my in flight meal."}
{"text":"Walked in at 5:50pm and their was just one customer eating.  No sign of staff.  I walked to the back & called out but got no response though I could see the shadow of someone moving about.  The other customer assured me they would be right out so I sat & waited.  And waited.  Finally got up & left.  Can't comment on the food because I never got any.  In terms of service though my experience was bad."}
{"text":"This place is just incredible. The food is off the charts good and the owners are some of the nicest people I've ever met! They truly care about every aspect of the business and food. No preservatives and everything is made fresh. I cannot say enough good things about Maxime's! If you are in the area I highly recommend stopping at this little hidden gem!  five stars across the board!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Everything we ordered was spot on and we can't wait for more. Hummus, grape leaves (both), gyro, falafel and beef Schwarma sandwiches we delicious! Wish we found this place years ago!"}
{"text":"I really was hoping this would be good but it was pretty below average. I ordered on the phone, and the proprietor could not give me an indication as to whether my order would feed 5 people. Told me to come in and see. When I did, I nearly fell over. I had to basically double my order on the spot. Some of it was heated  in the microwave while I waited. Very overpriced for small portions (on the takeout side at least). Food was OK--have had much better in the city. For the price I was expecting a good deal more--but practically had to beg for extra pita. I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"5 minutes after we sat down at the table a young man came out of the back door and asked what we wanted to order.I told him we needed a menu. When he took our order I ordered the KAFTA and a salad. He asked if I wanted the KAFTA over rice or the sandwich. I asked how do most people get it as I had never had it before. He said some people like one way, some the other. So I said I'll try it over rice. When our food came the KAFYA WAS on a plate with rice and a salad plus the extra salad I ordered. When we got our bill my $7.00 KAFTA sandwich was a $11.00 special. When we paid I told the lady about the mistake. She said when you order with the rice it was the special and it was $11.00.  I told her he didn't tell me otherwise I wouldn't have ordered an extra $7.00 salad. She didn't offer to adjust my bill or any thing. I would say be careful and ask questions before you order. The food was ok."}
{"text":"Casual BYOB Mediterranean restaurant with a welcoming owner who answered all our questions and made recommendations around vegetarian options. Fresh ingredients with entrees including side salad and pita."}
{"text":"This is an odd location but give them a try. The food is excellent and the friendly staff makes it worthwhile giving this establishment your business."}
{"text":"Best hidden little restaurant!! Honestly, if you like Mediterranean food this is a must try. Truly great food, Kafta is out of this world!!! Baba ghannouj was also great nice and smoky."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The owner was super sweet. I went on a weeknight with my aunts and my mom...and they can be a handful LOL! The service was a little slow, but I think we just came at the wrong time (everyone came at the same time). We liked everything, here is the rundown:

sleek- this is a warm app with beans and rice, we put it on pita like hummus. I would say out of all of the amazing food this wasn't my favorite, but it was still good

hummus- creamy, great olive oil. 

Tabouli- A-freaking-MAZING. It had something different in it, like cinnamon or something. Everyone loved it and 2 people got some to go.

Baba-Really good, smoother than some other baba, but I like that. Nice smoky flavor

Pita- average, seemed like it might be from pitaland

spinach pie- this was sooo much bigger than I thought it was going to be, but it was so good I had to eat it all

Other food I didn't eat, but people liked:

Special 1-a roast with rice. Everyone loved it (I don't eat meat), but I would assume it was good. 

Special 2- a french dish with cheese, noodles, and chicken. 2 of my aunts got this and loved it.

gyro- on the smallish side, but good

gyro salad- my aunt raved about the dressing. Salad itself looked standard.

Oh also, BYOB"}
{"text":"I found this place with a friend and we very much enjoyed our lunch. The gyros are spectacular and the lady who works there is super sweet. When you sit down she makes you feel right at home. It seems to be one of those places you have to know about beforehand to know it exists, but it is one of the gems of Moon Township. I've recommended this place to a few of my friends as well. I hope to be back again soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I met here for a Valentine's Day lunch.  We prefer to dine at non-chain restaurants and were glad to find this located nearby.  What a find!  We tried the hummus and baba gannouj and both were delicious.  The dressing on the greek salad was perfect.  Very light and refreshing.  The specials vary daily too.  My husband really enjoyed the beef special with okra.  We had lovely service and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Authentic for sure. Fresh friendly and affordable. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mediterranean cuisine. The owner was super nice and most of all the food was made fresh and tasty. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A bit of a weird place IMHO.  The seating area is an awkward mix between a restaurant and a living room.  The food gets served on a cafeteria platter with plastic utensils... Really?  The Lebanese food is decent but by no means exceptional.  Service is excellent though and the people are very friendly.  All in all a bit overrated on Yelp as far as I am concerned."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The owners are very nice, and make the food fresh.  I love the stuffed grape leaves and beef kafta the best, but everything I've had here has been good.  It's unusual to find a gem like this in moon township."}
{"text":"You have to go to the second floor to enter this restaurant. The first tour is there carry out place and the second doors are the restaurant. Comfortable ambience lovely and friendly owners. The kafta And potatoes and rice with salad was delicious. The spices were great. Only con where the plastic utensils. Will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Super friendly owners.  Very proud of his business and he should be.  Food is great!!  I have only had takeout, but they have a nice served area which is BYOB.  Can't wait to go try a served meal.  I am sure it will be like being invited into their home!"}
{"text":"We had just left the Pittsburg airport and I looked up the highest rated to grab something to eat. Being only a tenish minute drive we headed on over. Let me tell you this place does not disappoint. The owners are very friendly and the food was yummy. Make sure to take some dessert to go, it's the best baklava I've ever had."}
{"text":"We had the fattoush salad and the kafta 

The fattoush was very good but the kafta was excellent.  Meat was tender and the flavors were wonderful. 
Can't wait to come back and try some grape leaves and a gyro !"}
{"text":"A variety of fresh Mediterranean food that tastes delicious with a friendly atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Great husband and wife store near Pittsburgh airport. Definitely try the humus and the mujadarrah.  Ask for items a little warm sometimes they tend to be a little on the cooler side. Items are ready for a quick lunch definitely better then subway."}
{"text":"Authentic food prepared deliciously. They offer traditional Lebanese sandwiches and salads, plus some deli items as well. Attentive service and reasonable prices will keep me coming back. Several dishes I requested were not available, however there's plenty on the menu to choose from."}
{"text":"This is a place one could easily miss driving by, but it's worth going a little out of your way. We found it on Yelp because we were going to IKEA and needed some lunch along the way. This gentleman knows how to cook and cares about the quality of his food- if you stop in, you won't be disappointed. 
Maxime's is a cozy place where one side is the kitchen and the other a small dining room. The owner was the host, server, and cook. He was friendly and helpful with the menu, adamantly recommending my husband get the chicken tawouk wrap instead of the chicken platter as he originally planned. It was worth it because my husband said the wrap was \"5 stars\" and he doesn't usually get all that excited about his food! He really liked the combination of all of the flavors together in the wrap. I don't eat meat, but even I could tell from looking at it that the chicken was cooked perfectly.
I had the tabbouleh, vegetarian stuffed grape leaves, and baba ganoush (which is dairy-free, important to note as at some places they add yogurt so I always have to ask). The baba ganoush is to die for!! The freshest and creamiest I've ever had, I would go back just for that! The grape leaves tasted wonderful with a little baba on top. The tabbouleh and grape leaves were made with fresh ingredients but I felt the seasoning not quite to my taste. The tabbouleh had a hint of cinnamon which I didn't care for and the grape leaves could have used a bit more flavor from herbs or lemon juice, but still were pretty good."}
{"text":"A true gem, so glad i found this place the lady reminds me of my mother, greeted like family, every where else is really professional. And i like that to a certain extent. But feeling at home inside of a restaurant is, where its at. Thats because my mom owns a restaurant, good old fashioned mom cooking"}
{"text":"Wow is this place lowkey or what?! This spot sit next to Mario's on the second floor a shopping center over above the barber shop. Their service is outstanding and they will make your food quickly because it fresh! The gyro's are big, fresh, healthy, and hot. The homemade pita and fresh hummus with no preservatives is outstanding coming from me who doesn't like hummus at all I'd get it again it's more your typical garlic & herbs hummus. If you get the hummus and pita ask for an extra pita they only give you one. The lamb and beef as well as the chicken shawarma and gyro's are amazing, the garlic and cucumber sauce are delicious. The hot grape leaves with rice and meat are good as well! Now that they have the dining room With byob I will try it out and be back with some Beer and my gf now that I know it's bae worthy lol!! Enjoy this spot, I come here often and so will you, you're welcome :)"}
{"text":"Great Falfel, Gyro and kaftka.  They haven't had shwarma when we order.  Have only eaten take out here.  They have sit down with BYOB."}
{"text":"I was staying near the Pittsburgh airport last weekend and looking for a non-chain restaurant for dinner. Maxime's had good reviews on Yelp so I decided to try it. It was fine, but nothing special. I bet the catering would be good, as the photos look fantastic of some of their catered items.  The dinner menu was certainly reasonably priced around $6-$8 for salads and wraps. But that was really all that was on the menu. I ordered a falafel salad. The falafel was different than any I've had before and it wasnt bad but I wasnt a big fan either. I would probably not order the falafel again. I thought that the salad dressing described on the menu sounded good. It was supposed to be a mix of lemon, oil, water, sumac, and spices. But the dressing on my salad was some kind of balsamic vinegrette. I didnt care for it at all as it tasted like the kind I buy from Kroger in a bottle.  My dining mate had a wrap and he liked it a lot. It had really good garlic sauce.  
The hummus was pretty good too. It was cold as if it had been in the fridge and it came out in a to go container so I assume they sell it like that as part of their catering business. 
The owner was super nice though. He kept coming to check on us and make sure we were enjoying the food.  Because of the service, I would recommend the place to others but I just wouldn't say it's the best Mediterranean food out there."}
{"text":"It would be good for them to add fries or something to each meal. Either a wrap isnt enough to fill me up, or I order two which is just too much. Overall pretty good tho. I would order from here again."}
{"text":"Look, this place is for real goodies that don't judge based on appearance.  Food is amazing!!!  I had the grilled chicken with rice and veggies, then the surprised me with baklava that was the BEST I have ever had.  Plastic ware, plastic tray, water in plastic cup and soda served in a can actually, in hindsight, added to the charm of the experience.  Service is very friendly and they aim to please!  Go in and enjoy the food, AND get some extra baklava to take home!"}
{"text":"Opa!

I did not see any flaming cheese on the menu.    The location has two sides (this was my first time - I went to the take out side).   The restaurant was very clean.

I ordered a Gyro Salad - The salad was fresh.   The Gyro meat was not dry.   All was as you would expect.

I did order some Baklava - it was tasty as well.    I would give this place a shot if you are in the area and want a Gyro.    I will return.

I cannot wait to try the Shawarma.   FYI - They do allow BYOB :-)

{"text":"Was in town for business and wanted a fast dinner. Fantastic kafta sandwich and baklava!"}
{"text":"The hummus had a pleasant spiciness to it.  Loved it.  My hubby enjoyed his gyro, so much he ordered a second.  The grape leaves and tabouli were solid.  Finally some solid ethnic food in the area."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. It's on the second floor so make sure that you don't bring anyone who has trouble with stairs. The place is cute but don't expect spectacular service or nice place settings. You will eat w plastic utensils. Food was wonderful. The gyro was long and huge! Hummus and grape leaves were tasty. Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"I always judge a Mediterranean restaurant by its meat pies and the ones that I had here were terrible.  I can understand freezing less popular items, but the pies that I had must have been at least 2 days old.  They had absolutely no flavor other than the freezer burned taste in the dough.  With a place like Salem's market nearby, that quality of food is inexcusable."}
{"text":"Food was good but need to be served with something on the side like chips or a pickle or really anything. The sandwich was just that. A sandwich. Nothing more. We asked for water with lemon but was given bottled water. All in all it was ok but not great."}
{"text":"I am arrived on a Sunday just as the owner was arriving. He let me up and cooked for me it was so so so good and the service was amazing I had the chicken tawouk I loved it."}
{"text":"They get the award for best Mediterranean restaurant around by being the only one.  If you need tabuli in moon township, go here and chat with the friendly staff.

And chat and chat, because they are not speedy."}
{"text":"Maxime's is an amazing restaurant! First of all the food is wonderful. You have to try the chicken tawook and the fresh hummus. It's absolutely fantastic! If you prefer vegetarian fare, then definitely try the mjaddra! The restaurant has a cozy, homey feel and there is even another entrance to pick up take out. In addition to being a great place to eat, I was so impressed by the amazing job the owners, Elie and Leila, did catering our event. They prepared food for 200 guests and they went above and beyond in their service. There was more than enough food for everyone to enjoy and even go back for more. The food was fresh, delicious, and high quality. It met everyone's needs including: dairy free, gluten free, and vegetarian options. People are still talking about the food from the event that Maxime's catered. If you want options that will satisfy everyone and are fresh and delicious, Maxime's is the place!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, when you go to a restaurant like this it's always about the experience you have. I had a pretty great experience- I visited here for an hour and half. 

The ambience on the restaurant side of it is nice, clean, middle eastern feel, simple chairs and seating, it also has individual  lounge couch seats for if you want to sit back and enjoy some tea. 

The food was delicious- I know Mediterranean food. Very good tasting falafel salad and kufta sandwich- a good amount of food for one person. It wasn't too heavy which was great, salad had a lot of content- and I could eat the kufta all day filled with veggies and yogurt sauce wrapped in a delicious pita.

But the experience would not be as good as it was without meeting the owner, a personable guy- very friendly we spoke for quite a while- very nice person who owns a honest business. Great impression, gave me some baklava because he enjoyed my company! Baklava was on point. 

I will return"}
{"text":"The köfte is excellent here.

The prices are too high for the portions however. 

The owner is very friendly and the baba was excellent. 

If I could order a platter of just köfte and baba I would!"}
{"text":"Wonderful one-man operation in a tranquil area. My girlfriend and I wandered in from our nearby motel and found a soft spoken older Lebanese man who beckoned us through his office and kitchen into his dinner room which evoked the decor of the Middle East. He is adamant about making the best food and overall culinary experience for you. Meaning he will push you to be open to trying new things and avoiding substitutions. Food was delicious! Especially the hummus. Be sure to allow yourself time and patience. Also it's BYOB.  Best part is witnessing the pride he takes in his little restaurant! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, a little hidden on the second floor of a small plaza - doesn't really catch your eye as your driving past, but DEFINITELY worth a stop.  The food is awesome."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant, if you don't know about this place it's easy to miss but definitely worth a stop. Checked it out for the first time tonight and was not disappointed. We had the chicken shawarma, falafel, hummus, and baklava all of the food was super good. The owner was also a sweetheart and made the whole experience that much better. 
If you are looking for quality food at a good price check them out!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place! I travel weekly, and have eaten at many places, but this is one of the rare times I'm taking time to leave a review. EXCELLENT made from scratch hummus...EXCELLENT stuffed grape leaves. The special was salmon and rice with a homemeade Tahini sauce. I've never experienced so many flavors in one dish. This will be my first stop when I return to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mediterranean food.  The owner was great.  Very nice and cooked the food perfectly.  I didn't think I liked grape leaves but got them after reading the reviews and they were amazing m the falafel with spicy sauce was amazing as well.  Will definitely be back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall. Grab and go. Main dishes are made fresh and as you order. Overall, worth coming back."}
{"text":"One side is a small counter with takeout available. Then the other side has tables where you can enjoy your dinner, they even have a couple of outdoor tables.
The food is very good, fresh, with lots of unusual flavor so. If there is something that you would like but it isn't on the menu, just ask, the gentleman who waited on us was more than happy to create anything we were looking for.
The evening we visited was a rainy night and there was only one other couple here. I will say the service was a little on the slow side but only because there was just one person working that night. And it wasn't a big deal at all because a. He was so unbelievably nice and accommodating and b. We weren't in a hurry at all.
They have belly dancing nights and the place is BYOB so we will definitely return the next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Drove by here today and decided to stop and give it a shot. I ordered a Gyro and a Gyro salad (was on my way to work so I needed lunch and dinner) and I figured if they can do those right, their other food would be good as well. They use off the spit gyro meat and the portion size was good. The Gyro was wrapped in a very flat pita, the type that falafel is usually wrapped in, not the thick Greek pita that you would normally associate with a Gyro. It was very good and a little different take on what you'd expect. The salad was also good, with tomato, cucumber, olives and both Tzatziki and a house dressing. It was lacking Feta cheese though (may have been an oversight when preparing). Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"the owner is very friendly, the food and atmosphere were very authentic! highly recommended"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise of a Lebanese restaurant. Layla is the hostess, waitress and food preparer extraordinaire. I love her spunkiness and her overall disposition. 

I had a few hours to kill; I still hadn't turned in the rental car; and, I was hungry after visiting Failing Water. Yelpers said this place was excellent so I decided to swing by with my partner (business). 

Maxime's is situated on the second floor of what was clearly a motel. One former hotel room was for take-out and the other is the sitting area. Very discombobulated but it worked.    

The beef and lamb gyro's texture wasn't very good because it was overcooked and dry. The taste however was very good but the chicken looked great. Fresh baba-ganoush! The falafel was fresh and tasted great. Even better was the pistachio baklava. Only downside was that the didn't serve Turkish/Greek coffee; they had hookahs though. How appropriate for an old motel..."}
{"text":"Maxime's is simply great! I loved nearby and for so long never stopped in. HUGE mistake. Everything here is made fresh and is delicious. The service is some of the best I have experienced in Pittsburgh. 

The place isn't much to look at from outside, but the delicious food that awaits is well worth the stop.

In addition to some comfy outside seating, they now have a large lounge area. 

Get the falafel! It's SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"The Last time I came here  I had roosted beef that got me sick for two days !! Never ever coming back"}
{"text":"This place is a little diamond in the rough .... I found it one day purely by accident and glad I did....  The owner is extremely friendly and welcoming. I HIGHLY recommend the Kafta platter .... perfect amount of \"spice\" ..... This place is located across from the Sea Shell ...."}
{"text":"I love Maxime's it's amazing. The food is always hand made and fresh and the people are so nice. It's simple Mediterranean food with great taste, a must have if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I got a chicken shawarma. I was not very happy after tasting it. The chicken was very, very dry and the wrap didn't taste fresh. I doubt i will return"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure!!! This is s must try! I have been in the service industry for nearly 17 years. I have learned a lot about the food service industry over the years. The most important thing to me when choosing where to eat is my experience. Layla, is the owner and she is always and I mean ALWAYS polite. They say that no one loves your business like you do and Layla truly shows that in the love that she has for her business and her customers. Her love for her restaurant definitely shows in her food. She cares about her food. She uses fresh ingredients daily! She puts countless hours into her restaurant. Let's face it, we all work hard for our money and we deserve to spend it on good food and a good experience!! Her food is outstanding. If you don't know what to get, ask her. She will give you her honest opinion. I stop in weekly to grab a few containers of her homemade hummus. Which has no preservatives! Her salmon is to die for! It tastes so fresh! I highly recommend eating here!!!"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall you will find Maxime's upstairs so keep your eyes peeled. We arrived around lunch time on a Saturday and didn't see much happening. My husband asked me if I was sure I wanted to eat here, I of course said yes because I had read such great reviews of it. We walked up and the sign read closed even though it should have been open. What a disappointment. We were just walking away when a man opened the door and said they were indeed open. It was the owner and he apologized for forgetting to open the door when he got there! We ended up being the only people in there the entire time, so I assumed they must get most of their business during the weekdays. We wanted to try a few things since we are big on Mediterranean foods. We got the hummus for a starter wth pita. Great flavor, clearly fresh made, but I prefer mine room temp and this came straight from the refrigerator.  We tried one of the spinach pies, omg, that was delicious. Warm with the tastiest spinach filling and tender dough. The two of us went with the Kafta platter for our main dish. It comes with a large salad on the side and the spicy beef kabobs on top of a bed of rice and a creamy garlic sauce(which I wanted more of). The salad had way too many peppers, that was my only complaint. The meat was seasoned perfectly, not too much heat, just enough. We also ordered the baklava to take with us for dessert. When I tried a piece later that night I was in HEAVEN. That was the. best. baklava. I have ever had. It was so crispy from the copious amounts of honey layered in that pastry that baked up to perfection. I would go back just to buy that to go. It was honestly a great meal. The prices weren't cheap but they weren't outrageous either. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is a delicious, authentic Mediterranean restaurant. It is very affordable for the quality of food.  The owner was our server and chef, which we thought might affect the food time,  but the service was great.  I would imagine you might need to be patient if all their tables are full though. I would highly recommend their chicken shawarma.  It was amazing! Unless you want to pay for your water, you must specify you want a cup of water and not a bottle.  This was just my first visit, but I will definitely go back again,  especially place an order for pick up."}
{"text":"Maxime's is as fresh as it gets.  Handmade, high quality food that you can tell was made with love.  The rolled grape leaves are so tender you won't believe it, tabouli made the right way (IMHO) with LOTS of parsley and just enough bulgur wheat to give it some body.  The owner does a true 'feature' daily and I have already learned to never pass it up.  I had the chicken (marinated in just garlic, lemon and olive oil) over rice, and for what could have been a plain Jane dish, I was beyond thrilled.  I have been managing high-end restaurants (even a Lebanese place) for 15 years and it is hard to impress me with something so simple as grilled chicken...I was blown away by how well it was executed.  I have only been there twice, but the owner, Layla, has made me feel like I am a member of her family from day one.  You can't teach hospitality like that, it is just who she is.  Fantastic place."}
{"text":"Maxime's is one of the reasons why I decided to create a YELP account.  I rely so heavily on reviews before experiencing something new.  Without reading all of the favorable remarks, I would have continued to overlook the unassuming building.  I fear that since it is a smaller restaurant that not many people know about it, and I want it to grow and expand!!

The food is so delicious and the owners truly care about making the healthiest version of everything (from scratch!) without skimping on taste.  I am in love with the falafel salad, tabbouli, hummus, and baklava! 

The only downside is that the atmosphere is lack-luster and can be awkwardly quiet, but the food... oh em gee.  We more than often order to-go."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for dinner.  I ordered the falafel salad (but ended up receiving the falafel wrap), hubby ordered the chicken shawarma and we ordered the hummus appetizer. 

What's Hot
- Quality of food.  The falafels in my wrap were made fresh, so very warm and tasty.  I could taste the tzatziki drizzled into the wrap.  Hubby said he liked his chicken shawarma.  Our hummus had a slight kick to it, because of the paprika sprinkled on the top.  All the food was fresh and you could tell was recently made.    
- Portions.  Not huge, but not small.  It's Goldilocks- just right.  It's filling and the taste of the food leaves you satisfied.
- Prices.  Decently priced.  You pay for what you get.  Each of our wraps was under $10 each.  The hummus was $5.  Total, including tip, was less than $30.  Pretty good.  
- Simple menu.  First, they have a website, which is uncommon for this area for mom and pop restaurants.  Second, although the menu is short, it has the essentials- shawarma, hummus, falafel, tabouli, etc....

What's Not
- They charge for water.  This is a small mom and pop restaurant.  If you order water as your drink, which we did, you receive bottled water.  That means you end up paying for your water.
- Mistaken order.  I ordered the falafel salad, but the owner made me a falafel wrap.  Simple mistake, which I would ordinarily ask to be corrected.  However, because the owner runs it on his own, I didn't want to be a pain and also wait longer for my food.  

Observations
- It's a one man show.  The owner is the one who cooks and runs the place.  It sounds like his wife helps out, but doesn't stay as long as the owner does.  My point- be aware that it isn't fast service.  Our entire order arrived at the same time- water, appetizer, and wraps.  We were the only customers there when we arrived and the owner talked to us throughout our entire meal.  We definitely learned a lot about him and his family.  Haha....  However, he explained to us that he won't rush because a customer is getting impatient.  Makes sense, especially because this is a small mom and pop restaurant.  So be prepared.
- It's a mom and pop restaurant, which is on the second floor.  It's not a bad thing, but be prepared.  There are 2 doors/entrances.  The door on the right hand side is the kitchen and order area.  The door on the left hand side of the sign is the dining room area.  When we arrived, the door to the dining area was locked, so we had to go to the order out area to see if this place was actually opened.

Final Answer
I really want to give this place a higher rating, because the owner is personable and sweet.  Willing to come back again.  However, I'm more likely to order take out."}
{"text":"Maxime's is a FIND. 

Tucked atop a nondescript 2-story building on Beaver Grade Road, Maxime's is full of Mediterranean goodness, a to-go deli filled with hummus, baba ghanouj (perfection, just a great interpretation of this eggplant standard), stuffed grape leaves (lemony and savory but a little one-note), tabbouli, and other easy-to-eat, tougher to pronounce delights.

I particularly liked the Mjaddra Lentil + Rice, a hearty dish-warm and filling, topped with sauteed, succulent onions. 

We asked for pita and got it, but perhaps with a big to-go order it should just be included. There were more things to be had but not enough appetite to have them all.

The owner is darling, very personable and helpful, but it seems as if she might have been on her own, since it was a random time between lunch and dinner.

 A definite jewel in the rough, would love to try the falafel next, along with some of that delicate baklava."}
{"text":"This is take out.  But so good!  Stop and get a great sandwich, shawarma...some good mediterranean food at a reasonable price.  

Maxime has not changed and very hospitable and will tell you the menu and give you time to decide.  This visit had the Kafta sandwich with was very tasty.  
If you are in the area and looking for a good lunch, this is a must stop."}
{"text":"These dear people opened up for us to host a birthday party for our son. Our entire extended family attended. The food and the service was so fabulous that we are still raving about it and can't wait to return. We ordered a little of everything and cannot pick a favorite. We are so thankful to have found this wonderful restaurant...don't miss it!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, maybe one star isn't fair because I didn't eat there.  Because of the good reviews, I was looking forward to having dinner there tonight.  It was 6:00 on a Saturday night and not one person was there!  The place was empty with a TV playing so loud that I wouldn't be able to talk to the people I was with.   It was just too weird so we didn't stay.  I love mediterranean food and was hoping to have an enjoyable meal, but whay wasn't anyone there?  If it was as good as the reviews, wouldn't the place be packed on a weekend night?"}
{"text":"I found this place looking for a vegetarian lunch option in the area.  The falafel wrap was delicious and the grape leaves were probably the best I have ever had. Look forward to trying the other options on the menu!"}
{"text":"So Moon doesn't offer much in this food category but glad we have Maxime's. Food is good and it's nice supporting a family business when possible. I always get it to go but they offer a nice seating area and the service has always been very good."}
{"text":"I came around 1p on a Friday. I was greeted by the owners as soon as I arrived. Laila was my server & was very attentive, but it was just me & one other table. I ordered grape leaves without meat, lentil soup & Greek salad. The center grape leaves were cold so I just ate the ones on the edges. They mostly tasted like lemon juice & lacked seasoning. The lentil soup was delicious. It had small pieces of potato & greens in it. It came out in a plastic takeout container which was kind of strange. The Greek salad isn't what I would describe as Greek. It had plain black olives & the dressing was some kind of balsamic vinaigrette. The dressing was fine, I was just hoping for authentic Greek dressing. There were two chunks of feta that I had to crumble on my own. This is the only middle eastern place around so if you're craving, this is it, but there are several local restaurants that are far better."}
{"text":"Fresh made to order food. I had a Greek salad and Kafta. Friendly owners. I stopped by on a Sunday afternoon when restaurants can be a bit bothered serving food with light traffic, but I felt welcome here. Sauces didn't overpower the flavor of the other ingredients like some other places I've tried. The good reviews here are accurate- give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best hummus around! It is fresh, smooth and perfectly seasoned. Like the rest of the food on the menu, the owner only uses fresh ingredients with no preservatives. 

While I wish the meals were a bit more substantial this place really does create some great healthy dishes. 

I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a light Mediterranean meal or snack."}
{"text":"Drove from Florida to Pittsburgh and wanted something for dinner that wasn't a chain restaurant.  Great food served by good people, I had the kafta with rice along with grape leaves, hummus and baklava. Glad I found this place, would recommend wholeheartedly to others!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My god I'd eat here everyday if it was in my home town. 120% a place you must try."}
{"text":"It's delicious, quick, clean, and cheap. Although it looks like a motel from the out side, the inside is very clean and decorated nicely."}
{"text":"Nice little ma and pop lebanese take out restaurant.  Very fresh and fast food.  Show up twice and you become a regular where they remember your name.  Haven't had a bad thing off the menu yet.  Highly recommended.  You can sit outside when the weather is nice and they are opening down a sit down indoor cafe next door soon."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars just for the lady who runs the place. She is sweet, courteous and absolutely adorable... and more over get food is amazing. I wish it were located in a more commercial surrounding so that a lot more people got to taste and enjoy their food. I was staying at the double tree closeby and chances by them thanks to yelp. Will definitely be going there again to try more stuff on their menu. Their stuffed grape leaf is absolutely divine."}
{"text":"The service was slow, the portions are very small. I thought it was to expensive for the amount of food they gave you. My chicken was very dry."}
{"text":"Really good! gyro was delicious, baklava was tasty. the owner was a very kind man who gave me free baklava. will be back."}
