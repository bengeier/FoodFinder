{"text":"It's a dive of the worse kind.  Problems start at the manager and work through to the food.  I get it's a dive, but when you have young kids in the place, the wait staff and manager should not be dropping the F-bomb in their normal conversations.  I won't be back."}

Video games and pizza can't beat that"}

{"text":"I ate here and had the chicken wings and had a drink while I waited a long island ice tea and the waitress was sooo rude to me she had a attitude the whole time she finally brought the drink and I watched while she made the drink she put no alcohol in it I asked her to make it right she lied and then said she put more in then she usually does and then charged almost 8 dollars for it rolled her eyes stomped away soo I said get the wings to go she got mad again and then charged extra for not saying anything quick enough and the wings were HORRIBLE dry and freezer burned all and all I was a horrible experience food was terrible service was even worse don't ever eat here this place is a joke."}
{"text":"Nice! Gus's is open for breakfast. Soccer and omelets. They do a breakfast pizza also. Ice cold beer ."}
{"text":"Garbage!  First and foremost, Mike S., you have 3 reviews.... ALL 3 ARE FOR GUS'S.... WHICH YOU ARE BASHING THE OTHER 2 LOCATIONS!  ARE YOU THE OWNER?  SURE SOUNDS LIKE IT.  Anyway, moving on.  I have given Gus's 2 times... My wife has been 3 times.    The first experience was ok... Wings were decent.  Pizza was disheartening.  We ordered the \"king kong\" pizza with extra cheese and pepperoni.... It was huge!  .... And that was all..... The only quality of this pizza was it was big.  Very thin crust, a lot of air pockets... Scarce pepperoni.... Blah.  For around 28.00 it should have been \"good\" at minimum.  Service is less than desirable.  I had to refill my own drink and the waitress was eating behind the bar while working.  I know health code permits that.  Did I mention we were the only table in the place?  Sheesh.  So for around 60.00 (not including tip) we had a disappointing lunch.... But the wings were decent.  So on to trip number 2, quick date night, left the kids at home.... My wife wanted some wings.... So we headed to gus's.  When we arrive,  we notice the place was busy.... Good sign!  We sit at a table located next to a DJ setup.  Time is about 7:30.  Waitress greets us.  Immediately I notice this must be her 1st day because she doesn't know the beers on draft..  I think there are 4 total.  No worries.  We ordered the wings, a sub and a salad.  As usual,  wings were decent.  Sub was a spicy chicken wrap, and salad was good.    Now... About the DJ setup.  While we were waiting for dinner, I noticed a \"card\" on the table... Which had a \"stripper's ass\" pictured..... And a dude with his arms around 2 girls.... Phrases like \"featuring DJ so and so...\" and \"VIP bottle service available\"..... I am thinking... This place is turning into a sleazy club at 11 pm... It is no bigger than 2 subway sandwich places combined.... The DJ equipment looked ridiculous in there.... Not a family type place if you ask me.  Try explaining that promo card to a 12 year old \"pre teen\".  Best part of \"date night\".  Bill was dropped off... I glanced at it... I noticed wings were rung up at 12.50 instead of 10.99 as on the menu.  I inquire for a menu to double check the price... And sure enough, 10.99.  Another server says.... \"your server didn't tell you when you ordered them, they were a higher price?\" I said no and I would like to speak with a manager.... Now, it isn't about the 1.50 more, it's about charging me what is printed.  If the server had said up front... Wings are more, no problem.  We would have been informed.    Manager goes into some song and dance about how they are using \"bigger and better\" wings, so they had to raise the prices.... And was I sure the server didn't tell me about the price increase.  What a joke......  Wings looked the same as last weeks... No different.  So, Gus's New York \"not so much family\" restaurant.... Good luck.  I hope you clean up your act....."}
{"text":"I try the authentic Philly cheesesteak very cheese and greasy and it  is was delicious and good it been long time since I been here the hot wing are good too"}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews here but maybe things have changed...for thw Better in the last 4 months that I have been coming here (04/2014).  I have had the Pizza, Calzones, Wings, Pasta dishes & few of the Subs and also the Gyro (chicken).  I have to say, besides the Alfredo & tomato suaces on the pasta dishes (they are totally fine just a bit on the bland side) being just OK, the rwst of the food is authentic, very well prepared, delicious and fresh.    I'm from Boston and lived in NY city for 2 yrs and gotta say Gus' s pizza is really on par with everything you get on the East coast.  Now, everyone has a different like & take but as a whole the pizza crust is great, sauce is perfect with not trying to do too much with salt, garlic or too much herbs or seasonings and the cheese they useis very good along with the topings selections being fresh and of good quality.  The pizza & calzones are always baked and cooked just right so they are not too dry/burned or doughy or bland.  The only other thing would be the rolls they use for sandwiches, those could use a little more hardiness ( I love the Jimmy Johns bread/rolls) and are a little soft for my liking.     The wings are killer (get them with the NOT listed Golden Spicy sauce and you can't go wrong with a good \"hot kick\" & sweetness and I always ask for my wings to be extra well done for that extra crispy wing).  They have good drink specials and a good selection of beer on Tap. The best part is all the bartenders and waiters along with manager, cooks and delivery guy inhave had have been very avcomodating to making things juat the way you order things and making changes/additions to your liking.     The other GREAT thing is that they are the only establishment that I know of anywhere close to goodyear that are open till 2 am and most nights till 3 am for the late night craving but will also Deliver very late.  They have the Football package on Sundays and a $0.50/per wing on Wednesdays.  I have never written a review or posted anything before but really like this place and would like to see them get more business so my favorite place keeps going."}
{"text":"I attempted to order pizza late night from this place, I accidentally called their Goodyear location which answered and responded quickly. Unfortunately for me their other restaurant was closer. I called multiple times without answer!!! I already left 1 bad review before, I thought I'd give them another shot, I guess I should have stuck with my initial instinct. Garbage overpriced pizza. I even left them a voicemail, lets see if they respond. I doubt it!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings from Gus's today. We stayed at the Hampton and had the food delivered to the pool area. The pies and wings were delishious!!"}
{"text":"They are open. Just got pizza tonight.  From the flyer I took a picture of. I got the xl pizza (looked small to me) and 10 wings for 13.99 I asked for delivery and he said I was way far and that it was going to be 4 dollars.  WTF?? I was 2.5 miles he then said Ok 2 dollars for delivery and that he had a long night partying the night before (jokingly on his part) so we have recently made it a family thing to get pizza every friday going on 4 months now and usually we stick to the norm which is get a large pizza from barros and wings from Rays on 7th Street and bell. But being that we had the flyer I figured why not it's a heck of a deal for an XL (medium in actuality) pizza and wings which looked  like someone went to the miniature chicken farm. There was hardly any meat on them and the sauce was terrible. Got mild being that my girlfriend  thinks taco bell mild sauce is spicy. Lol And some fries when all said and done it turned out to be 21 and some change. I left a good tip because it's not the drivers fault that the owner makes food that isn't good enough for sheriff Joes inmates. The pizza was thin and cheese taste like rubber there was hardly any sauce and pepperoni that tasted so old that it was probably thrown out on an episode of kitchen nightmares. The wings were seriously so small I will take a pic of it next to a bite size snickers or something but 10 was equivalent to 3 or 4 you would get at a REAL pizza place. And the fries were cold and rubbery as well like we got the leftovers from the mornings shift. The food was terrible and the price was not worth what we got. Little caesars is better by a long shot. Overall the food was garbage and the kids asked why we got this pizza and only took a few bites which is rare because they usually eat 2 to 3 slices but tonight they only took a few bites and gave the I'm full excuse to not have to finish the worst pizza ever sold in the state of Arizona.  I am not exaggerating at all. Worst food and a waste of a family pizza night. Sad because the kids ended up eating a few sandwiches.  I would advise to save your money and not try this place. I wish there was negative star ratings because I would give it -3 stars. Hopefully you can take my word on this one. I'm sure they will be closed soon because the quality of the food is so poor that homeless people would probably pass on it. Oh well never waisting my money ever again. Thank you for reading my review and saving your money when thinking of ordering from her."}
{"text":"The pizza is exceptional!  The sauce is a true Italian flavor!  After returning from a trip to the true boot shaped country 7 years ago I have been searching for that specific taste, and now I have finally found it!  This restaurant is small and family oriented, the staff is very friendly and authentic to the culture.  I will return to this restaurant on a weekly basis, so I will be sure to see you there!    Brian B."}
{"text":"This a great late night delivery. Pasta is hit or miss. Wings are good, pizza is okay for the time frame of late night. Service is EXELLENT and very accurate, if not even early. I will always use this resturaunt with all that in mind. I'm never disappointed by the late night orders, but would only like a pizza with more fullness. That's all. I'm going to advise this place for all your later night needs."}
{"text":"I keep trying to give Gus's a chance, but everytime I have been there the staff is rude and do not know what they are doing.  The pizza is average, the wings are really dry and nasty."}
{"text":"Below average pizza.  Wait staff was pleasant tho.  Kids couldn't stand the place and we never came back."}
{"text":"Great service !! I usually order for delivery once a week but decided to dine in this time . Me and the family came down and enjoyed everything from start to finish . Appetizer came out speedy fast , my wife had a mushroom burger which she said hands down best burger she had , my kids shared a small cheese pizza , and myself I had a chicken parm pasta which was 10 out of 10 best pasta I've had . Our server mike was great he checked up on us frequently . Overall great experience and the place was definitely a family environment . I'm definitely going to refer my family and friends here."}
{"text":"Very horrible experience!! Long wait time to get waited on, food to be served, and to get the check! Was in the restaurant for an hour, and 45 minutes of this time was waiting. Spilled a drink on a friend... Didn't even say sorry!! Floor is extremely sticky. Women's bathroom door doesnt even close."}
{"text":"If this review was only for their pizza I would give it 5 stars.  Been there several times.  Be aware if you like shots expect  them to be watered down... Even jäger, and Patron tastes like watered down lemonade. Although you can't beat the happy hour of buy one domestic beer get one for a penny.  At least try their pizza...don't think this place will be around long."}
{"text":"I don't understand the previous negative comments probably because they had really lazy servers or whatever in the past but now I can say the service is really great. I only had to wait two minutes to order my drinks and food. the people are friendly and the prices are very reasonable they have happy hour and they also have pizza specials so I say give it a try and see what u think. I am satisfied. When you come in see Bianca"}
{"text":"I almost didn't try this place due to the bad reviews but I notice about the reviews was mostly people's perspective about the place instead of the food. Which is by the way amazing. The crust is very thin so your not being fatten up by dough and the wings were delicious too. They have 50 cent wings on Wednesdays and the slice of pizza is $2.50 you can't bet that."}
{"text":"Great place! Thursday night 2 for 1 drinks and great music! It's a great place to unwind drink and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"The lady on the phone was very angry. She yelled at us for prank call which we did not make. We got off airplane and were very hungry we wanted to order pizza and she yelled at us for not using caller ID. We don't have regular cell phone numbers so we used no caller ID and we yelled at. No pizza. No satisfaction. Daughter and I are upset."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza from gus pizza at midnight thru grub hub which always works but tonight it didn't work apparently but when I called the first time after about an hour wait the young lady said that the order had already left that it'll be there in 10 minutes or so.  So I continued to wait until 135 am then I gave them another call the woman said that it was grub hubs fault for not submitting the order when I had the confirmations.  She didn't apologize about the \"inconvenience\" she just said would you like to place the order now. She didn't offer any extras or anything at all simply said have a great night and hung up. I eat there about 1-2 times a week.  Worst service by far."}
{"text":"OK...... Pizza was below average nothing special about it at all. Nothing's \"jumbo\" about the \"jumbo wings\" and to add insult to injury the wings were over cooked and dry,  it was like dipping chicken jerky into water(because that was the texture of the ranch). Also notice that cooks in the kitchen wore no hair nets, which might have contributed to the hair that was found on the food. The only positive amongst the plethora of negative was that our server was very polite and courteous unfortunately that was not enough for me to want to ever return."}
{"text":"They left a flyer on our door so we tried out their delivery last night. We asked them to FRY the wings to extra crispy and then ordered a specialty pizza to go with them. The wings were BAKED and if they would have been up front about that, we wouldn't have ordred them. Their specialty pizza had a big dump of minced garlic instead of baked in fresh garlic slices so that was all you could taste. Plus we asked for thin crust hoping to get a crispy pizza but it was still soggy and you had to use a fork to eat it. The wing sauce was good and the meat quality on the topping were good but not enough that we'll try either again. Maybe one more shot on their pasta & sandwiches but we'll have to wait and see on that."}
{"text":"We love this place, great pizza and wings.  We usually end up there on fridays after work and we always sit at the bar.  The service and the food is top notch, really the only thing I can even give a negative about is the layout of the restaurant.  The tables and the open ceiling really create a very loud environment, and we eat at alot of sports bars and this place is loud.  But we usually sit at the bar, so no big deal.  We love the food and the service keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was wonderful! We got the White Pie and it was very good. It did take a little long for us to get our pizza, but the wait wasn't terribly long. Overall, great experience and very good food!"}
{"text":"I had been here before in the past but I couldn't remember if it was good or not so I gave it a shot. I waited over an hour for my food. When it did finally come the wings were soggy and flavorless. The pasta, if you even want to call it that, was mushy, bland, and like one of those microwaveable dinners you buy for a dollar at the grocery store. It was terrible and a waste of my money. Please go elsewhere. Other than being open late this place has no positive attributes."}
{"text":"I heard this place wasn't very good, but needed to try it out for myself. ...I think th pizza is good and wings are delicious. Bartender Rosa is awesome and server Kait!!  Business is slow at times such as other restaurants, but when it gets busy, it gets happening and fun. This is my new hangout for the West Valley."}
{"text":"Food and service are pretty decent. Been here several times and so far no complaints. I give only four stars because of the ambiance, it could be better."}
{"text":"My family loves going to Gus's. They typically know our orders and names by heart. We are there at least once a week. For the most part we have great experiences going to \"our spot\" ... With the exception of today. New employees threw us off...  I decided to meet my husband there. I arrived and no one said hello. There were 3 people sitting at the bar and a table of about 10. That's it. I sat for 10 mins smiling at the waitress and bartender. The waitress helped the table... Went to the pick up window.. Talked to the cooks, filled some bins with forks, took the other table their food. Not once was my attendance acknowledged or was I asked if I needed anything. My husband and son arrived.. No one said hello to them either. We waited another 5 mins. The bartender didn't even come over to see if we wanted anything. I watched the waitress and the bartender have a conversation between themselves .. Then the cooks. After waiting for about 20 mins we bounced to Native.   To management: we love your place... But please train your newbies."}
{"text":"pizza  was ok.  the location is decently spacious. lotsa  screen tvs   however,  we called in to assure that our party could watch our nfl  team play and we were denied.  we've watched games here before and the staff willingly accommodated us.  we invested money on pitchers,  appetizers and  large size pizzas.    so  the young,  simple girl that  took our call  claimed that because Gus pizza  is a \"Oakland raiders\" bar that they didn't want our business. lol really?  the raiders suck and so does this joint.  the raiders will never make it and neither will Gus pizzeria  after a  unprofessional  and ignorant  remark like yesterday 11/10 sunday  mngment  should address their  weekend staff"}
{"text":"Family decided to go here for lunch today. We started out with the sampler and the food was cooked perfectly. We shared the Bronx bomber monster pizza. The flavor was spot on. My only complaint is the crust wasn't as soft as I like in a NY pizza but the flavor overcame this. Wife ordered the fried mushrooms and loved them. They allowed me to try the wings and I loved them. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered delivery using a coupon. The driver was great but the coupon was not applied to our bill (the person who took our order never verfied the total when he took our order). When we called to have this fixed they offered to credit us the difference for our next visit- which was not helpful because we don't eat there often. When they finally offered to refund our money and we started eating our garlic knots were completely raw inside, the wings weren't good, and our pizza was mostly sauce. We didn't bother calling to let them know that our food was raw because they probably would have offered us free food in the future and we have no plans to eat there again. ever."}
{"text":"ONE OF THE MOST HORRIBLE PLACES IN THE WORLD! Coming from someone who works in the service industry for many years I'm very understanding when things get busy and it takes a bit... When they say \"45 min\" ok not bad but when 1 hour passes and we call and they say, \"we went to your home and knocked and no one answered and tried to call you.\" Yet my phone has no miss calls? Nor did anyone knock? And the girl says,\"what do you want?!\" What I want is not a snobby girl to answer the phone and provide decent customer service. I WILL NEVER GIVE THIS LOCATION ANY BUSINESS NOR WILL ANYONE I KNOW! Might as well just close because it doesn't deserve any business... Owner WILL be notified if I have something to say about it..."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good but THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!  We went there last night, ordered some wings and pizza, and it took for ever! We're talking over an hr for a pizza. There was only 5 other people in the place. All guys watching football and drinking beer at the bar.  We loved the pizza and hated the service so much we ordered it for pick up and it was a disaster. First, the guy (Sebastian) did not know the pizza we were trying to order, even thoiugh it's one of THEIR specialty pizza's. We were explaining it and he kept saying they didn't have it. Finally, I guess he realized what pizza we wanted. We ordered it with extra meat and the olives on the side. When I went to pick it up the olives were on the pizza. He tried to argue with me over what I said on the phone and said if I wanted another one it would take 40 minutes. I have a brokem wrist and did not feel like waiting (this is the reason we ordered take-out in the first place) so I said I would take it but wanted him to know I was extremely unhappy with the service and would be writing a negative review. He continued to argue with me about what I had ordered and then said I could go ahead and write a bad review... He had been getting a lot of them. I said \"you've been getting a lot of bad reviews?\" He said yes. I said \"I'm not surprised.\"  We've had their pizza downtown and loved it so we were very happy to have a Gus's in our area but I will not eat here again. This guy was not only unfriendly and ignorant but so unwilling to help or try to make things right. NOT the way to inspire repeat customers!!"}
{"text":"This pizza was excellent!  We usually go to Barro's, but I'd say this was better.  Thin crust and we had the Greek pizza, kids had the pepperoni.  I'm not a big wings fan, but the honey BBQ ones were very good and disappeared quickly.  The service and atmosphere were fine, nothing to compain or rave about.  I'm surprised about other reviews that don't mention how good the pizza is?  I thought it was exceptional which is why I'm writing this."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! My daughter received a splinter from the wooden chair. The wings were freezer burned and undercooked. By the rudest staff on the planet. Dank dark and distgusting."}
{"text":"Hearing about the \"All you can eat\" pizza slice lunch special was fantastic. Eating it was not. I wondered how they could do that and still be in business. I've been known to put away a whole pie myself. It's called sauce. Marinara. Tomato paste. Really, anything that makes the pizza less dry. This place skips that unnecessary pizza waste. But they don't make up for it with flavor, either. I tried a pineapple slice,  a pepperoni and a spinach. The blah crust and cheese overpowers any of the toppings added. You can't really go wrong with pizza, but this place doesn't do anything right. Service was friendly, but slow as there was only 1 waitress for lunchtime."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION. I have dined at Gus's quite a few times, I always go to the goodyear location. When I went to this location, the staff was unpleasant and the managers didn't even know their policies, they would not serve me a drink even though I had a valid drivers licence. I was appalled and offended, it didn't make sense to me. On top of that I ordered desserts and the cookie was black on the bottom..completely burned. How could you even serve that?  The cheesecake taste like it's been sitting in a freezer. Horrible location, I recommend the goodyear location where the management knows what they are doing."}
{"text":"Not a family oriented place to go. Especially on Sunday. Obnoxious sports fans and a staff that is accepting of rude behavior. Will gladly spend my money else where."}
{"text":"I can confirm that this location is not closed. Just ordered a pizza through grub hub and it was delivered hot and on time. Crust was a little thinner than I had expected but overall was a good pizza, the convenience of ordering through grub hub was a plus and the delivery charge wasn't over the top like some other restaurants on grub hub."}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere. Lots of TVs with sports. Good music. Small bar area. Seating outside. Pizza is really good. Nice employees!"}
{"text":"I've been here once but i hear its a spot!! The slice of pizza i had was delish!!  I noticed music playing , which i liked, and beers were decent price. They also had video game systems for those that like to play! I enjoyed it and definetly will be back !"}
{"text":"Called to place a order, was put in \"hold\" the phone was just set down so I can hear everything in the background waited patiently for 15+ minutes listening to talking, occasional phone ringing and taking other calls to finally get someone back on the phone. I asked about the 10% discount for 1st time orders and was told per the manager I can't use it because someone probably ordered before with the same last name... so weird!! Very poor service over the phone."}
{"text":"Went here with my family, not impressed.  Was really looking forward to lasagna, but had to order something else, because they didn't make any that day. I ordered the chicken parm. Sorry but no flavor, my daughter ordered Alfredo with shrimp, but had to get chicken because they had no shrimp & no flavor.  Decor was good like the open bar & patio, can lose the raiders decor, sorry your in Az now.  Waitress was great."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of pizza, this place changed that for me. We found this place a couple weeks ago, my wife Loves pizza so we go have it occasionally. I absolutely love the pizza and service at this restaurant. Nicely Done y'all. Finally found a pizza place both of us Love."}
{"text":"Love this place  ! All you can eat mon thru fri and big tvs for all your favorite sports !"}
{"text":"Perhaps something has drastically changed in the last month, but anyone who rated this place 5 stars was either paid a very large sum of money or lacks serious taste - likely a combination of both.  In the words of the late, great, Rick James, \"I wish I had two more hands so I could give this restaurant four thumbs down!\"  It all began with a trip to the neighboring Vietnamese restaurant which a friend noted had decent food. Of course, this place was randomly closed on a Wednesday in the summer. I am not in tune with Vietnamese culture, but I can only imagine that something more important than running your business is happening on a Wednesday, in the summer, in order to be closed. We decide to wander over to Gus's Pizza, complete with the unnecessary \"s\". We take our seats right around noon. About five minutes later we are asked if we want a soda, no option for Iced Tea or water at the time, just simply, soda. Two Iced Tea's, a Coke, and a \"Cherry\" Coke later, we decide to order appetizers. It's roughly 12:19pm when we place our order as follows:  -One 10 piece order of 'hot' wings -One Special (all you can eat pizza, single topping slices, $4.95) -One Fire Burger, Medium, with Fries. -One Fire Burger, Medium, with Onion Rings. -One Chicken Gyro, with Fries.  Ten minutes pass before the waitress informs us that they only have one patty and two burger orders. I forfeit my burger and choose the Beef Gyro. Five minutes later, I hear an \"Oh shit\" in the background. The waitress returns informing me there is not any beef for the beef gyro and suggests a chicken gyro, I pass.   12:40pm   -First drink refill received  12:49pm  -Hot wings order received  12:54pm  -One Fire Burger Received  12:58pm  -Chicken Gyro Received -Side of Onion Rings Received  1:03pm  -Magically, some beef gyro meat was found. My gyro was delivered and I was informed that I would not be charged for the gyro or onion rings.  1:07pm  -Two slices, one pepperoni, one sausage, received.  I'll point out a couple of things if they weren't already obvious.  A pizza joint, which has pizza in the title of the business, should probably have pizza ready during lunch hour, especially when offering an \"all-you-can-eat\" special. I found it strange that the pizza was delivered last.  As far as the missing beef, it brings me back to the Burger King commercials from the 1980's, \"Where's the beef??\" - well, had I known it would taste as it did, I'd be asking, \"Where's the door?\" To their defense, the place was not known as Gus's Pizza, Burgers, and Gyros.   With the exception of the wings, which were fairly decent, the gyro meat looked and tasted microwaved. The burger, which I tried a small sample of, reminded me of reheated cafeteria food - the kind you would get from public grade schools.   The onion rings were over fried and the fries were showered in salt (not the quick shower, better related to the long showers where your mom questions why the water bill was so high last month.)  Our bill, less the comped gyro and onion rings was just shy of $39. We split it four ways. I tipped a hair over 20%, mainly because the waitress was polite, despite the quality of the food or slow service. Also because it is the first and last bit of money they will ever receive from me.   Thanks for the experience."}
{"text":"I have to say my hubs & I were happy to see a NY style pizza place on the West Side because fingers crossed that meant good wings. We did have wings & they were Tastey with a capital T. The sauce good consistancy, crispy & spicey. The pizza on the first visit should have stayed in the oven a tad longer but the ingrediants & flavor were all there. We knew after the wings & cold beer we would be back. Upon return  we knew going in next time what to expect. We made a second trip to Gus's for the wings but opted to try the greek salad as a side (my suggestion) & it was good. We got the small one & shared. Again ingrediants fresh & good & we enjoyed it. We were pleasantly surpsrised to find that the pizza was in the oven long enough & great the second time. We didn't get one with red sauce though to try to aleviate the sog issue & it worked. The thing with NY pizza is the dough/sauce ratio & the heat on the oven so if any of those are awry the pizza is on the soggy side. Eliminate the red sauce & you're golden. Note: If you don't like a younger club age group avoid nights after 10 with the DJ. If you like or don't mind because we defintely don't mind them then by all means go forth any time of the day. They have drink specials on Saturdays too but they don't start until 8:30."}
{"text":"A simple large pizza and wings was supposed to take 45 minutes to an hour for delivery and ended up taking an hour and 40 minutes. It may have tasted good when it was hot out of the oven, but when it arrived it was cold and the cheese rubbery. The wings were in a dried congealed bed of what was once the hot sauce I presume. At nearly twice the estimated delivery time and cold I should have ordered Domino's and saved a couple bucks. If your going to be this late and deliver cold how about you shave a couple bucks off the cost to make up for it???  This was my first time giving them a try, not sure they will get a second chance from me. Just a bad experience all around."}
{"text":"I went here because of the location close to my friends house.  The service was kinda slow, but the food was pretty good.  Its such a mixed crowd, I gave it 3 stars.  Some people will give it 1 and others will give it 5.  Go here for cheap drinks, food and games playing for a good time.  If you want a fine dining experience, I'd suggest elsewhere."}
{"text":"The wait staff was nice and put effort into their failing restaurant, but even if you put a bow on a pile of shit, it still looks and smells like shit. Let me give you a little idea of how our visit during a typical lunch hour went:  12:10: arrived and ordered drinks 12:18: received drinks  12:19: ordered food 12:49: appetizer #1 (wings) delivered, also told by wait staff that they only had 1 burger patty left (the place was completely empty, it was not busy at all) and that they also did not have \"beef\" for the gyro 12:52: person #1 food delivered 12:54: appetizer #2 delivered 12:56: person #2 food delivered 12:58: person #3 food delivered \"just kidding, we have beef for the gyro\" 13:00: person #4 food delivered (pizza special) 13:25: check received  I had a burger, it was awful. The worst symphony of flavors I have ever tasted masked by spice. I was hungry and couldn't even eat more than half of my food. The fries were good though...  The gyro meat, looked like a shoe tonque that was lit on fire and not meat.  The pizza looked like Red Baron, for being a \"special\" I'm not sure why it took 40 minutes to be served... I think we all know how they get away with the price for all you can eat. It would take 3 hours to eat 6 pieces of pizza and no one would want to be sitting in this place for that long.  I don't know what the appeal is... this is supposed to be a bar. NOTHING to look at. Even if I drank enough to have beer goggles.. I would struggle in finding anything even remotely appealing. What I am saying is, this is the worst restaurant I have ever been to that is still open."}
{"text":"I dream of their pizza sometimes. We carry out their Pepperoni Pizza a few times a month & if we are hosting a game night with our friends, we get the 36\" pizza. I like it best the next day after throwing it in the toaster oven to make the crust and cheese a little crisper. WAY better the next day. And yes, i wake up craving this pizza on some occasions. The restaurant is a bit dark, but it's probably so you can watch the bid screens better."}
{"text":"Late night pizza...Liars. I have been calling for an hour. No answer!!! Then they pick up the phone and hang up. Horrible way to run a business... You should follow what your box says.... So disappointed... Because the pizza is actually good."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much only good if you're half in the bag and desire greasy food down your gullet.  Ive tried several different menu items hoping that the next would be better than the last aaaand I was sadly mistaken.  The calzone was giant and greasy, the pizza needed to be dabbed with several napkins, the wings were dry and it was like chewing on rawhide... you cant really win with this place.  Furthermore, I'm a night owl that works late hours, so when I want something that isn't a drive-thru burger, I'll call for a pick-up order. The last time I did this (around 1am-ish and the place was packed),  I approached the counter to see 4 people standing there... one was on the business phone, the other three were texting.  Nobody even looked up to acknowledge me.  Not a single one. Really, guys??  Its called customer service. Try it sometime.    Yup. I think I'll have to stick with drive-thrus from here on out."}
{"text":"I've dined in and picked up, both times the service was decent. The pizza and breadstick are very good, both flavorful. The size and quality of the pizza is worth the price."}
{"text":"The pizza Wes cold , is the to long to get the pizza , and pizza is was disgusted !!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an alternative to your large pizza shops or looking for a respectable New York style pizza, this place can accommodate.    For those who complained about a greasy mess with tomato sauce I would suggest you understand that a New York style pizza is just that sometimes, a greasy pizza that Homer Simpson would appreciate.    If you are concerned about wearing your weapon inside well that's a whole different mess and I am not a lawyer but do believe that in Arizona you can be a huckleberry and carry guns but the state also provided the right to the establishment to refuse. Thanks btw I do believe forks and napkins should suffice to eat!!    Anyhow how did I digress? Ohh yeah the pizza! So the place seems to be a destination for a variety of peeps!  They were setting up a DJ when I was leaving with my take out.  They have a full bar and TV's for your usual reality TV an football games.. Their outside patio was a ghost town but I will say the 111 outside might have something to do with that.    Given that in this side of town there not too many options in terms of good pizza, I'm sharing more love than normal because after all you can't drive 20 miles out just for a good pie all the time."}
{"text":"Tried this place 3 years ago didn't like it then but had friends over and decided to give them a second chance. Wrong pizza is still cheap and crappy tasting and the wings were just as bad.....so this was the last time I'll be here"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza in PHX, on this side of the Mississippi ever!  If you haven't tried it you have to stop by.  Rosco is a really cool guy and the man in charge of the magic in the back.  The girls are friendly also, really great customer service.  I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Been to this place twice now. The first visit I tried the pizza and it's pretty good! Tried t he Bronx Bomber and it was pretty tasty. Service was fine, so was wait time. Wasn't pleased to find out it was a Raiders bar and the people that come with that, but i'm not gonna fault em' for a football team(albeit a bad bandwagon team).   Now my second visit is what took it down to 2 stars. I went to the bar for some drinks and immediately the bartender was unfriendly. I had pulled up a post from their facebook for a free drink and she gave me a dirty look. Next order the beer I wanted was out, so I had to get a different beer. Not too big a deal.   Then I ordered an amaretto sour. This confused our simple bartender, looked at me like I was crazy and made me a glass of half amaretto and half sweet n' sour(wrong, if you didn't know.).  It was okay, not the worst i've ever had. I then tried to order a Rum Collins, a very common well drink, and again the bartender looked at me like I was crazy. She asked me what it was, I explained \"Uh...Rum & Collins mix? You know, Rum Collins...\" She fed me some bullshit that they didn't have one or another ingredient so I just told her to stick to another Sour. I watched as she ran out of Amaretto after MAYBE a shot, looked around for more, then just filled most of the glass with sweet n' sour like I wouldn't notice. It was horrible, as it was essentially just sweet n' sour. I took that crap right off my bill and left. The bartender was inept enough to not even know how to make simple well drinks that include TWO INGREDIENTS! I can make a better cocktail than this cavewoman.   I would return to eat in the seated area(not very nice either, reminds me of a couple of tables thrown in a warehouse with Raiders swag thrown up)  for the specialty pizza, but then again why do that when Palermo's is right around the corner? Will never return to the bar and they lost a lot of money on me as I would've been a regular customer for at least the next year if they weren't children who couldn't mix a Shirley Temple if their life depended on it."}
{"text":"Seriously, I ate the best Philly Cheesesteak sub this side of the Mississippi at this restaurant but could not eat all of the onion rings because it was a lot of food. My friend had a meatball sub and salad. She raved about both and said the salad was one of the best she has ever had. The service was great, staff was friendly, and I will definitely come back. Also, they deliver anywhere in the metro area, so don't assume they are too far away."}
{"text":"The don't even a big deal in food is like reg common fast food maybe a good recp on pizza but other than that nah and then they ask me. So this is for delivering and went like yeah it is why and then she said theirs no way that I can be pick up i said no!!! And then she ask the delivery man and I Gan hear what their taking and she ask him do you gone make this and he said no and then she tell me that is imposible and she hang on me I call back and she said I'm sorry there's nothing we can do no solutions no sorry's no nothing piece of garbage customer serv is horrible this is unacceptable people"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here a few times, had some issues with wait times and getting order wrong. I've been issued several credits, because they can't seem to get it right. The pizza is good, but it is super greasy! The wings are just ok. If you ask for extra crispy, you get them charred!"}
{"text":"I stopped at Gus's for lunch today.  I always like to try new places close to the office.  So, I walked in and sat down at the bar.  The stools are too short which makes the bar way too high.  It is especially high if you have to eat off of it.  The rest of the place is pretty nice.  They have a few tv's and it looks clean.    I ordered a Meatball Sub with fries and a drink.  My food arrived about 5 minutes later at which time I asked for some Ketchup.  The sub was cold yet the cheese on it was melted....    Cant explain that....   The fries were almost too hot to eat yet I managed.   Overall, the food had very little flavor.  I finished eating and received my bill promptly.  I was somewhat shocked at an $11.11 bill for a sub w/fries and a drink.  Wait a minute, I was SHOCKED....    I mean really, come on......    There are literally dozens of pizza places to eat lunch and these guys are charging that much.    I guess I would think about returning to eat here if I could afford it.   Instead I think I will go to Barros and eat for less than half the price.     BAM!"}
{"text":"I have ordered twice now from Gus's and some of the food has been great and some not so much.  The fries are not very good, neither the regular or the sweet potato fries.  It may be a mistake to expect them to be good even with delivery, but I was disappointed.  This second time I ordered I didn't receive my full order.  They were out of the ingredients for the salads and because I ordered through Yelp24 they were unable to contact me.  They also only delivered one slice of the fried cheesecake (which is delicious!), not the two that I was charged for.  I contacted the restaurant and they insisted it was in the bag.  I just called again and they're sending the full order, as well as the salads.  I am grateful they came through!"}
{"text":"potential to shine. went for lunch beer was cold. wings were good. pizza could have baked longer cuz center was too thin to pull and just floppy. got stomboli to go and it was good. the nite life is what i think this will most designed for with nice open air bar to patio."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! have gone back a few times. The place is a bit run down but don't let that fool you the pizza is crunchy and tastes like ny pizza. The best Ive had in a long time!!!!!  Plus their lunch special is wonderful"}
{"text":"Great place right off IH-10 and near Luke AFB. The food is awesome and the service is outstanding! Ice cold beer and great wings too! Great atmosphere also."}
{"text":"The staff and service was great but the pizza was ok, I got 2 slices of hawaiian pizza and the pineapple was canned. The size of the slices were big though so that made up for the lack of taste"}
{"text":"Crappy ass food and crappy ass customer service. Don't go here. Waste of time and money. Workers there don't know what they're doing and rude AF."}
{"text":"So so disappointed. I worked as a waitress for a few years so I know the \"tricks\" and they definitely pulled them. We were there for lunch and our waitress was the only one with about 5-6 tables so service was slow but even that was better than the food. The pizza was burned. We thought it was maybe the house style but the tables next to us weren't burnt. The onion rings, fries and zucchini were prepackaged. The pizza was bland and sub par. But the biggest offender was the wings! Here's the trick part, anything that doesn't sell the night before, you stick in the fridge and refry and serve it the next day. The wings were horrible, recooked to dry parchment, flavorless, excuses for wings. I have NEVER left a bad review but after spending 50.00 for lunch and getting crap."}
{"text":"We have ordered pizza here for a couple years now and it's always been good, until tonight. It was over cooked and dry. We spent $30 and it was by far the worst pizza we ever had. I called thinking like a normal place of business they would replace them. The guy said no and we couldn't even bring them back because it had been an hour since we picked them up. I explained we don't live close and they still wouldn't replace them. I wouldn't even give one star."}
{"text":"Large parties are not welcomed here. We had a group of 14+, easily going to spend around 300$ and they wouldn't let us move tables around to accommodate our group. The \"policy\" wouldn't allow the rearranging of tables. We even asked the manager if we could move the tables ourselves. And he said no. Taking our business and money somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have to say that I did not care much for the pizza but the subs are fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst pizza. It was soggy and very very greasy. The guy who took my order was rude, and kept cutting me off. I got a large 1 topping pizza and it was almost $30 after the $5 delivery charge! It also took over 1 hour to have my pizza delivered! I also got sick the night I ate it and so did my husband...we will NEVER eat here again..peter piper has better quality, service, and prices."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for some pizza and was so surprised they had white slices. I've been in AZ for 3 years and always miss good New York pizza. I would say their pizza is close to small chain pizzerias if you want a good New York slice try garden pizza in Goodyear but if you want a close to New York small chain \"Mario's pizza\" style pizza an need a white slice fix give Gus a try. Got a special surprise the chef made some tiramisu and let us try it. Absolutely fantastic"}
{"text":"Tried and enjoyed Gus's NY Pizza and we really did enjoy it.  Good pizza, good pricing and nice staff.  May not be THE best around, but certainly a solid pizza choice in the Goodyear, Avondale, Litchfield Park area!"}
{"text":"We love Gus's New York Pizza and Bar.  They have a lunch special of all  you can eat Pizza for $5.99 I think it comes with a soda but Iike to have beer with my pizza.  The pizza is really great tasting and hot, the wait staff (Erlinda) very personable and efficient.  This is one of the few places I have been where the owner comes over to see how everything is and she spends time talking to  you.  This is a good place to go to and just sit back relax and enjoy the food.  It is also the only all you can eat where you order your pizza slices as you want them, you don't get cold pizza off of a buffet line."}
{"text":"I ordered through grubhub.  Horrible service.  Took 1.5 hours to get here.  Jalapeño poppers came with marinara sauce instead of blue cheese.   Burger and fries were cold and soggy!  They must have been hot when the driver left but the steam in the container made it all soggy.  Fettuccine and meatballs (that I paid $3 extra for).  They took 2 meatballs and cut it in half and put on top of fettuccine making you think you got 4 full meatballs.  Then the deserts were completely squashed in the containers.  I don't have one good thing to say about this place. Don't even bother ordering from here."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with my fiancé and brother! Pizza and wings were delicious and our server was friendly! Overall it was a great experience we will definitely be back. Perfect little spot to watch some football and eat pizza!"}
{"text":"This place is REALLY good. Amazing thin crust. Wings are perfectly sized, their hot wings are really good. The atmosphere is very chill and super fast delivery."}
{"text":"I have been going to (and getting delivery) here for the 2+ years I've lived in Avondale. From the phone call to place my order today to the poor quality food (and the gentleman's comments that delivered.. he said he was the general manager) it's obvious there has been an ownership change.  I've always told everyone about this place.  Unfortunately I won't be returning or referring any longer."}
{"text":"3rd visit - I keep going back because my friends insist it will be better. Everytime I order the wings they are cold - not uncooked but like they have already been sitting out there a while before getting to our table. I informed them of this yesterday and was told they would bring back new ones and instead got same ones we had just reheated and dry :( -- No complaints about the pizza - its what I expect everytime -- bartender is horrible :( - stands around waiting for order to come to her -  I ordered 3 different drinks and they were no where close to what the drink should be - Im not a reg beer drinker but gave up and just started ordering beer .. they have no clue how to make a good drink."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great pizza and wings.  Icy cold beer and decent music.  They have a patio, so great place to sit and enjoy the cooler Arizona evening.  Decent prices.  A great hang out spot."}
{"text":"They stay open late til 4am. The pizza was great and wings were good. Its hard to find good wings most places put too much breading. These were just right!!! Had great service and the manager came by the table to say Hi. Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"So we heard about this place and decided to give it a shot. It was good. We just ordered the boneless wings, which were outstanding and a pizza which was decent. The beer was cold and the service was good.  The second time we had our pizza delivered to us and we ordered the giant pizza they have. We were having a party and got hungry late that night. Since they stay open and deliver to the wee hours of the night it was perfect. OMG the pizza was huge. Also very good. Needless to say, no left overs that night."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings !!! Thursday night has a great atmosphere and drink specials.  Also have to check out Tues for 1.25 tacos . I was shocked how good the tacos were for a pizza place. All around a great place to eat , drink and have a good time."}
{"text":"Food is good but never ever on time, if they could get that squared away all would be good. If they better their timing and not say 20 min for pick up and you arrive and its really another 30 waiting around, not ok."}
{"text":"We used to order here all the time ! My last order was over $50 and it took the driver over an hour to deliver the pizza. We called and the manager told me the order would be discounted 20% and my next order would be 30% off. I called back 15 minutes later because I STILL didn't have my order and was told the order would be free . After checking my account to make sure my card was not charged sadly I was charged the full order amount."}
{"text":"My only problem with the pizza I just had was that I ate way to much.  They did screw up my wings order slightly in that I asked for honey mustard on the side and they gave something else entirely (but still good)(Togo order)   This was our second trip in and can reiterate another reviewer that the staff is always friendly.  I would. Given a 5-star with the correct sauce for the wings."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying first impression doesn't matter all the time. This past Saturday my self with some friends went there to try it out, we get there and everything started off good. Our waitress was nice, attentive and just good service at first. Well as my friends an I where there hanging out ordering drinks and just having a good time we decided to order a some jolly ranger shots, the ones that we got just tasted nasty. They tasted like cough syrup ewwww, well the manager came over and got those drinks fixed which it was kudos but why would we pay for them if in the first place they where nasty, the ones that he fixed should of been a complimentary after all we where going to spend more money. Well My friend and i order vodka with redbull which guess what they ran out of redbull (fkn bs) well after that i order another drink as my friends and i walked out to the patio i saw the manager and just making simple convo i asked him about being out of redbull and he answer me back with an attitude which wasnt cool on top of that he told my friend that if she wanted whipcream and a cherry on her piña colada she should of order (like wtf other bars they give it to you or asked you,  which none of those happen)....Well as we went outside and the manager saw that my friends took their drinks with them to the patio meaning that we weren't leaving just yet, which he thought we where gonna leave without paying, because after we where outside he send the waitress to check up on us and how do I know, because she was in front of my friends and I telling him over the headset\"yes they are out here\" like are you fucken kidding you fucken douche bag......To me that's what killed the whole thing, I was gonna give you good ratings but because you couldn't tell your employee to be more freaken discreet killed the hole fucken thing......So if you guys want to be treated like your not going to pay, because your out in the patio just hanging out don't go to this pleace. Management fucken suck!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!! They messed up my order and when I went to complain to management. She said there was nothing she could do about my problem. Looked at me , like I was the problem. Seriously?!? What the hell are you there for than? I understand we're in the west valley but there's no reason for the lack of customer service. The pizza was also not very good. They charge for refills if you go from a coke to a sprite. Like they're not both soft drinks. I will never go to this restaurant again. Gus's gets no stars from me."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time this weekend. We joined TWO friends for food and drinks. After the FOUR of us ate, another friend joined for drinks only. This makes FIVE. Mind you, this fifth person never once looked at the menu. He just ordered drinks from the server who had been attentive until that point. About an hour later, THREE more friends showed up making us a party of EIGHT. The FOUR of us that had been there from the beginning had continued to order drinks as the party grew. Never ONCE did our server mention there's a gratuity charge for parties of SIX and up. When questioned, all the staff could say is that it's policy to charge gratuity for a party of our size and that it's printed on their menu. Never mind the fact that not everyone looked at the menu. It's not hard to order pizza and wings from a PIZZA & WINGS restaurant!!! The server walked away with a hefty tip plus the gratuity we were charged. We wondered why she was quick to want to cash us out at the end of her shift. The applied gratuity explained it all. Not only had some left tips, they were also charged over $24 in gratuity! I asked for my gratuity back on both my checks since we had been transferred to another server who was rude an was hanging out with customers at the table behind us instead of doing her job! I was told they couldn't do that since the original server had already cashed out. I didn't let it go and the manager eventually got the owner on the phone. After explaining the situation and educating him on customer service, billing disputes and ethical business practices, he agreed to refund my funds! I would suggest anyone that visits this place with large parties pays attention to what is charged since these people are shady as hell and prey on those consuming alcoholic beverages. My one star rating was necessary in order to post this review but in reality this place isn't worthy of even that one star."}
{"text":"Ok, we are through with Gus', last time they asked me for id to pay for a pizza in my daughter's name, she had surgery that day and could pick it up herself she told you that on the phone.  This time they told her it would be 45 mins...so 45 mins later they tell her they don't have a pizza for anyone with that name.  So she orders again.... Goes back they tell her she is on the \"shit list\" for a no show earlier today!   So.... Who would order from these idiots again with their mediocre pizza!  Little Caesar is mediocre  but they are hot, ready and cheap.... Hello Little Cesar!"}
{"text":"Chefs need a training in what \"a la vodka\" sauce consists of. I am born and raised right outside New York City and grew up in a Italian household and worked in an Italian restaurant, never have I seen \"a la vodka\" sauce thin and grey. If that is how they choose to prepare it they should provide a description of the dish like every other pasta dish has on the menu so it not misleading. Disappointed is an understatement."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!! This place is all around terrible. First the food was horrible. I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza and some fries extra crispy. When my food arrived the pizza looked and tasted like something you would purchase at a Sam's clubs definitely not New York Pizza being a native new Yorker I know better. The  fries were soggy and limp after I had requested specifically for them to be crispy. The service itself was horrendous our server maybe checked on us twice during an hour and a half visit and she was not really busy maybe 3 other tables most of her time was spent behind the bar socializing. The service was so terrible we had to wall up to the counter in order to get our check and even when I asked to just pay the woman working at the register shooed me away telling me \"You need to pay with your sever\" who did not show up to accept our payment for another 10 minutes. I would not recommend this place to anyone who wants decent pizza and service worth paying for."}
{"text":"two stars May be too many.  lousy food.. pizza had some funky taste to it, almost like it was burnt. service was mediocre at best.  servers did not know what the happy hour food was. place was full."}
{"text":"$100 for two large pizzas and 30 wings? no thank you..especially when the pizza was super bland..daddy dukes any day.or little ceasers. or pizza hut..or dominoes...or a frozen pizza from frys."}
{"text":"Pathetic place since new Management took over.  Treat their customers like crap.  Never again.   Wish I could give a Zero rating."}
{"text":"So dissapointed.  I'd like to start off by saying I have had a long day at work and didn't want to cook dinner this evening. Seeing posts all day on my Facebook about how gus's had tacos for taco Tuesday made my husband and my choice easy. We placed an order for delivery for 16 tacos and a 2 liter of soda, totalling $30, still worth not having to cook. Placing the order I was told it would be 45 mins to an hr, after an hour and 10 minutes I received a phone call from gus's stating that I had not answered the door and the delivery guy had left already, I told her I have some very loud dogs who freak out every time anyone even walks up to our door and they had not moved a muscle. She said she would call the delivery guy and tell him to try to redeliver. When he finally showed up he told my husband that his GPS had taken him to a different street.  When we opened up our boxes of tacos the tortillas were hard and cold, the meat was ice cold also and the tacos were tossed around inside the box, far from the delicious pictures I'd seen on Facebook earlier. So I called the store and was given a manager who agreed to replace our order this time with pizza and wings and apologized for the inconvenience. However I'd have to wait 45 mins to an hr again for delivery. This time the food showed up an 45 minutes later, hot. Yay! But forgot my 2 liter, I again had to call the store. Now, 30 minutes later I've finally been given my missing soda. I'm exhausted and going to bed. I wouldn't recommend ordering tacos from here especially for delivery, there's tons of options for taco Tuesday and I think I've learnt my lesson and will venture out instead of getting delivery."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 slices to go last week. Pizza went straight to the garbage. They even have the nerve to call it New York style pizza. This place should not be serving food to the public. You will do better buying a frozen pizza from Walmart."}
{"text":"Walked in and ordered a beer, bartender came back a few seconds later saying she couldn't accept my ID anymore because it was the old version. ID wasn't expired. I have never had any problems with that till I came here. I just took my business to Applebee's down the street."}
{"text":"Spent last Saturday taking my nephew Halloween costume shopping and we wanted to stop for lunch.  I looked in my coupon book and found Gus's.  Wow! What a great lunch we had!  The pizza was YUMMY!  We ordered a medium Pepperoni and Pineapple.   We LOVED the pizza!!  So much better than your average pizza from those chain places. We also had some boneless buffalo wings.  The wings were GREAT!!!  So glad I found this place!!  They also took my coupon without a problem.  The staff was very friendly.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Went to try the huge pizza they have after church. We ordered two of the giant size pizzas. One was a pepperoni and the other was a Bronx. The only bad thing is that they charged for each of the toppings on the Bronx. It took about 30 mins for both to be ready. We had to put our pizzas through the back of the SUV since they are huge! The whole family ate and we still had left overs. The pizza had a great flavor. My family was pleased with it."}
{"text":"This establishment is trash...they do not not answer their phones.... whoever owns this place must be rich cause they don't want my money. I called numerous times without answer...all I want is Pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time with this place. I know NY pizza and this isn't it.   The first time we placed an order for delivery and it took over an hour to arrive. We were quoted 45 minutes and it was close to 90 by the time the food arrived. I called and spoke with the managers twice. The delivery guy called us because he was lost so we gave him our right address. I called the restaurant and they wrote down our address wrong. The manager assured us our food would be fine since they are kept in insulated containers to keep the food hot. NOPE it seemed over cooked. The pizza was like card board, the garlic knots were dry and old tasting, and the wings barely had any sauce on them.   The manager told me he would put a credit on our \"account\" so we could give them a try again.   So a few weeks later we called for us to pick up the order. We ordered the exact same things. When I arrived they had no notes on our \"account\" about a credit. I refused to pay and said I didn't want anything. The cashier went and got a manager (not sure if he was the same one I spoke with a few weeks earlier but he never once spoke to me and apologized for the mix up and the poor food the first time). This manage said it was ok to comp my meal.   We got the food home and the pizza wasn't cardboard but it was still very blah tasting. The garlic knots were much better and the wings were better but not worth ordering.   Go here if it's late at night and you are looking for someplace to eat. Other than that, not worth stopping."}
{"text":"What happened?   The pizza at this place used to be good?!?!  Terrible pizza tonight.  Definitely not New York style.  I've had better frozen pizzas.  You guys need to reevaluate all these low scores you're getting.  Yes the wait staff are nice and the beer is cold.  But pizza is a sad thing."}
{"text":"Tried them out last night for the first time. Worst service I've ever experienced. Were not greeted by anyone so guessed we should seat ourselves. Finally an annoyed looking waitress came over to get drinks she returned with empty kids cups and a pitcher of water for me to fill. Wings were delivered with no plates, drinks were empty. Finally pizza was delivered and plopped next to the table without so little as a smile. So I had to stand up to serve my family their pizza Again drinks EMPTY. Pizza was subpar at best. We had to get up to find waitress (gossiping and playing on her phone behind counter) for silverware, plates and drinks. When the bill arrived she had added gratuity because we were a party of 5? Went with my husband and 3 kids youngest of whom is a BABY. WOW worst service and shady waitress."}
{"text":"Was skeptical to try Gus's pizzas due to some reviews we had read, however, there was a particular review that listed the Goodyear/McDowell location as being \"better\" so we thought we would give it a try. We are definitely glad we did! Delivery was faster than anticipated. Pizza was hot and lived up to the New York style we like. We ordered our usual pepperoni and jalapeño , was fantastic. Our favorite pizza restaurant is Grimaldi's which is across town and does not deliver. We hope Gus's will be our faster, local, more convenient version for when we cannot make it across town and craving pizza. We are anxious to try more menu items and will definitely order from this location again. Phone order was pleasant. Delivery was fast. We are happy first-timers."}
{"text":"Never again will I ever go here customer service is rude they give me a cold pizza because they messed up my order so my kids have to suffer then tells me I have to wait till five to fix my order so that's five hours my kids go without eating their pizza not OK then she overcharged us and tell us we stop the way to five for a money back the worst customer service and the sandwich disgusting I can't even pick it up and eat it never again will I ever be going there"}
{"text":"I have been here before and the food isn't the greatest. In my opinion the location on 91st and Thomas is better however it's closer to me so we came back. I am at 45 minutes now waiting for 36 wings. And I am still waiting. I went through the same thing last time. I definitely do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"OH YEA! Bring on the grease! Nice new pizza place in the area with late night delivery! Prices seem pretty good and so far what we've had to eat here, pizza and stromboli, have been yummy. You should expect a fair amount of grease so be aware of where you put the box down (had a bit of clean up on my car seat from this). For me though this type of food you should expect to be greasy so that is definitely NOT a bad thing LOL. The pizza has that nice \"foldable\" crust too. The restaurant is a decent size and has a long bar to enjoy a beer at as well. We will have to try this place a few more times and will update my review as needed...for now, go ahead and give it a try."}
{"text":"Being open late makes this place convenient, other then that there aren't many positives. The pizza is okay,!the boneless wings are microwave boneless wings from Walmart, all soggy. Stay away from them."}
{"text":"Another owner, I wonder how long it lasts this time? Pizza is good and happy hour is great! Its a bad location as this is like the 4th or 5th restaurant to attempt to survive. Good Luck guys!"}
{"text":"We were seated quickly. The hostess and waiter were very nice. We sat outside which was nice. I ordered the small house salad with balsamic house dressing and the small pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. The croutons in the salad were stale. The dressing was watery not much flavor. The pizza crust was crispy but the middle part was soggy. Not much flavor either. I came here once before and that time was a lot better. Disappointed tonight!"}
{"text":"This place offers a great slice. The quality of the food is fantastic, the size of the slice is huge, and the price is cheap. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is good. Came here today for my boy's basketball party and we got this amazing gigantic party pizza. Had great taste, good crust and service wad good. Will come back. Maybe things have changed from previous reviews. This place works!"}
{"text":"This place went bankrupt pretty much right after I started to frequent it.  The crowd was fun, but I don't know how the restaurant actually passed a food safety license."}
{"text":"Now I understand the picture of the roaches on this check in!   Went here for dinner just to try out the new neighborhood pizza joint. Pretty excited after reading some good reviews.   I was the ONLY food ordering table in the entire facility. Two other folks sat up at the bar. Not busy by any means.  The service was good, our waitress was friendly. That's pretty much where it ended for me.  They didn't have ice tea, out of coke, finally settled on something else. The wings ordered were over cooked with what seemed like grocery store bbq sauce drizzled over. The pizza, well. It was about as plain as you can imagine.  Again, we were the only table ordering food, yet it took FOREVER for our meal to come out.  Something in the restaurant smelled like urine, not sure if it was from the bathroom or something else. Needless to say, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The worst service! Called Sunday night at 10pm and ordered a pizza. 12:30 rolls around and they finally call us saying they will not be able to deliver. Then called and spoke with the owner on Monday for a refund since I did not receive my pizza. The owner then said he does not know how to work his POS system and that he only bought the company a year ago and can not issue a refund. And the. Told me I would need to contact my bank to dispute the charges because it would cost him 200 to call his POS company to learn how to issue refunds. The most unprofessional experience I've ever had. Will never order from this place again! The owner young is terrible!"}
{"text":"I'm no stranger to Gus's, because I've dined and imbibed at a few of their locations in the valley. It's been a while since visiting their location near Banner Estrella. Me and a friend would occasionally drop in there to hang out and catch up. The service there was unremarkable and the food was average.  This review, however is for the Gus's in Goodyear, near Litchfield and McDowell. I've also dined at this location with a few friends over the last few years. It's almost as if it's part of a different chain of restaurants. The food is better. The beer tastes better. And the service is actually decent.  Sometimes I will Yelp! about a business because of a shining example of customer service. This time, I want the kitchen (and the west valley) to know about the excellent Italian Beef I enjoyed recently. The bread was amazing with a great crust! The sandwich was loaded with tender, flavorful beef. And the side of \"gravy\" sealed the deal. Don't forget to ask for hot and sweet peppers like I did.  I may have just found an outpost in the west valley that will save me from having to drive to the other side of town (Luke's, Portillo's) for a decent Italian Beef. Thanks, and see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Horrible pizza... Burger was decent. Should rename Gus's burgers because they can't make a good pizza"}
{"text":"Honestly, I really like this place. They have Four Peaks Hop Knot on draft which is awesome. I really like all the food I've had there but the big thing is that the bartenders, staff and I think the general manager have always been really nice to me. Met some really cool people. You should try it out!"}
{"text":"Went for the 'all you can eat\" pizza at lunch time. Pizza was not bad, certainly better than a lot in this area. Service was good, attentive waitress. Manager was friendly and  personally took my order, explaining about the pizza and how to order so I got just what I wanted. Clean and friendly with decent food (at least the pizza). Seemed like they had a nice size crowd for lunch, Could be a good place to watch a game and have a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio where our dog was welcome. The pizza is very good and the seafood sampler is too. The service is wonderful. What started as a place to go have a drink and it turned out to be an evening of good times with fun Folk."}
{"text":"It's actually a pretty cool place.  A local watering hole with friendly locals.  Made new friends and the Wife enjoys the place.  Can't beat that!  The bar has a pretty cool garage door that opens too."}
{"text":"First visit...it's really all about the 1st impression. We walked in and looked around to figure out the layout. We decided on the bar. No one greeted us. The bartender came to look at us, so I let him know it was our first time and requested a menu, since one wasn't offered. We literally had to ask for everything, lemon and salt for our beers, etc. We eventually ordered a white pizza. Ok, not better than zellas $5 cheesy bread! Once he brought our bill, i asked if they offered military discounts, but perhaps he didn't hear us, even when i yelled it over the bar. Once he returned with our CC, i asked again. Turns out they do. He did not apologize or say another word. Needless to say,  we will not be returning,  ever!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from these guys a few times. Each time something was either missing or incorrect.  I have never been satisfied with their food. Soggy wings, soggy-chemical tasting pizza, and really awful burgers and pasta. I also hate that they need to take a copy of your card to run it... Only place I know of that does this.  If you Like cheap bar food that lacks flavor and horrible customer service this is the place for you."}
{"text":"First of all, your staff is amazing! Rich welcomed our family group and made us feel right @ home.   Awesome Pizza and great service! My Family's new hangou!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten there, so I can't address that.  I only can address the quality of the pizza. I'm usually only a fan of thick-crust pizza, but for thin crust, this is excellent."}
{"text":"I went in here on a Sunday afternoon to pick-up a pizza and wings that I had ordered over the phone. The environment was very relaxing and the place was very clean. The pizza was ready when I walked in right on time, and the people were very friendly. The pizza was delicious and the boneless wings were a little crispy instead of soggy like some places. I am very happy with my experience and plan to go again but to dine in. I highly recommend you give them shot and try them out!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here last night. The delivery was right on time. I ordered an XL- Mushroom Pizza, Mozzarella Sticks, and Garlic Nots.   I had eaten in before and had really good pizza and appetizers here. But What has happened?!? The pizza that I got last night was NOT New York style pizza. It was a thicker crust and there was so much cheese that I had to take some off. I didn't order extra cheese but even if I had this would've been complete overkill! It completely overwhelmed everything else. The garlic nots where overcooked and hard on top, but were ok. The best thing I ordered were the cheese sticks, but even then I could've bought some from the store that would've tasted better. I'm so completely disappointed that I'll never return."}
{"text":"*Bonus* that they deliver some pretty amazing food!  Not just Pizza but wings, gyros, sandwiches, sweet potato fries and everything in between! Everything taste great and I will definitely be ordering again! I can't believe I've waited this long to try GUS!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight. Food was good. My daughter and myself ordered a seafood basket and a small white cheese pizza we added bacon. They had lady night tonight. 5.00 wrist band. Then .50 drinks after that. Wanted to drink more but it was a bad day back home. We will come back ."}
{"text":"I just called to order a pizza a little while ago and the person who answered said they were closed because \"only today \" they close early. I then asked to speak to a manager and she put me \"on hold\" for 15 min. I then hung up and called again, the same person answered and I asked if she was going to direct me to the manager and all of the sudden she said she was the manager. I asked for her name and she she said \"ummm why would you need my name ?\" and then told me to \"just stop fucken calling\" and hung up. Worse service I've ever gotten from a pizza joint."}
{"text":"This place sucks, the service is horrible. We ordered our pizzas and only got one, when the \"waitress\" finally realized that she messed up she wanted us to wait for 45 minutes extra. Never come back, all the \"servers\" suck! The pizza is so greasy. Terrible food, terrible service. That's why they have drink specials, so you get drunk enough to think their food is good."}
{"text":"Elizabeth was our waitress. This place is very divey. To the extent they serve food on paper plates. We were going to Ak-Chin for a concert & this was the only close spot (not fast food or Italian) The one cool thing they had was a gaming wall where you could play old school systems (Nintendo, N64, Sega) They are apparently know for their NY 32' pizza challenge. We had the sample platter (app) A supreme pizza & honey hot wings. All typical bar food material.  This place is in a strip mall & is very dark inside. Not our type of place, but it worked to feed us prior to drinking @ the concert. If you don't live by Ak-Chin Pavilion, don't know the area & have time to explore other options....I would recommend."}
{"text":"First experience here was awful. Got delivery through GrubHub, the BBQ burger with onion rings and pasta a la vodka. I'm not sure where they got their vodka sauce recipe but it is unlike any vodka sauce I've ever seen before. It was a grayish, thin sauce and the pasta was full of mushrooms, which is maybe understandable but still strange. It was much more like an Alfredo, but with a ton of mushrooms and terribly cooked. I assumed they had sent the wrong pasta dish, but when I called about it the manager said that's just the way they cook it. I was under the impression that a vodka sauce was generally cooked the same way (tomato based) with maybe some different flavors depending on the chef, so either I've been wrong my entire life or they are trying to pull one over on me. The rest of the food wasn't as bad, but it still wasn't good. The bread that came with the pasta seemed like it was microwaved. The onion rings were all totally soft. The burger was cooked properly but had very little flavor. Moral of the story: never assume a dish will be what you expect it to be if you're getting it at a new restaurant. I certainly won't be ordering from this place in the future, and I encourage all other Yelpers to avoid it as well."}
{"text":"Horrible service! especially on NFL Sundays. We waited over an hour for an order of wings and a pizza. The wings were tough, and the pizza was cold. The bartender screwed up on a simple rum and coke, and the servers were not all that friendly either."}
{"text":"Wanted delivery pizza as a cheat day delight. More like a disaster. Pizza was cold, super greasy, no flavor, and not good at all. The garlic knots were burnt and soaked with grease yet was still hard as a rock. The salad was so so; too bad the pizza was so unappetizing I didn't want to eat anything else. There were 4 of us \"eating\" and not half of the pizza is gone. This is food I wouldn't allow my dog to eat."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to leave this review at all locations. Ordered here through Uber eats and got a full refund,  because the food was that disgusting. Guys I think this is a pizza chain in a mall. And not even a regular mall, One of those malls like half flea market half mall. The pizza taste like garlic Clay. The wings looked like shit and tasted like boo-boo. Shocked they could even package it and ship it out. None of the phones work at any of the locations. Do not eat here, avoid!"}
{"text":"I'm more disappointed then I should be. The guy was on the phone with a non customer when he was taking my order and still messed it up. It was simple, a slice of supreme with no olives. I picked off all the olives but I was just very disappointed with the service. I asked for a water because I can not drink Pepsi product and still ended up getting a Aquafina water which is Pepsi product. He should have asked if I wanted bottled water.  I tipped on the card and I wish I didn't, it's not that type of service place. I just thought I would be kind, because why wouldn't you when someone else is making your food.  The food was good though I have to admit and the dinning is very clean. Underneath the pop machine can be cleaned but everything else is not bad."}
{"text":"We come in a few times each year to watch the early NFL matchups on Sunday (on our way up to UofP Stadium). I can't speak for other times but Sunday mornings are fine at this bar. It is a bar atmosphere though - I wouldn't recommend bringing young children. We bring my parents with us and even when it was a Raiders bar we were treated nicely.  They have all the games playing. It's not too crowded. The pizza is hot. The bottled beer is cold,  and it's inexpensive.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. $5 for fried mushrooms and there were only 6. Kids mac n cheese was just plain noodles, buffalo chicken sandwich was inedible with soggy bread and chicken so hard you can't even chew it. Called to get my money back or get new food and they tell me the cook is on break for an hour and they'll get back to me after that. Absolute joke of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Not really thrilled with the atmosphere or the clientele they cater to at this establishment. Gangbangers one night, biker gangs the next. It used to be about the pizza till they added the outside bar area. The food is also not as good as other Gus's Pizza and they are owned by the same people."}
{"text":"I paid $40 and got Tyson chicken nuggets.  We ordered the boneless wings and they're not what we expected. Wasn't terrible but we're definitely going to stick to the other location off of Litchfield and McDowell."}
{"text":"3 Stars for the food, but no stars for service. As soon as we arrived Friday night the waitress was very rude. We asked for French fries after we had placed our order and she told us if we were sure bc we already had food coming. we ordered another round of beers at last call and it took her 10 minutes to deliver it. There were only two other tables! She also argued with my cousin about cheese fries bc they didn't have cheese and fries w mozzarella are not cheese fries. We also asked for sauce on the side for the wings and she seemed bothered when we asked her for extra since it was 2 very small sides. We'll make sure to ask for someone who wants to give good customer service next time, if we ever decide to go back."}
{"text":"This place wings r the grossest things ive ever eaten will never order again will not return"}
{"text":"Found a new pizza joint! Loved the thin crust pizza, friendly service and just overall vibe of the place! Right by the McDonalds on McDowell / Litchfield rd. Also go check them out for Wing Wednesday!! You'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Mercedes, Mary, Stephanie and rest of the wait staff are friendly and fun. D.J Rich keeps the fun times rolling at nights.  Great place watch UFC, come and participate in the UFC Score Card contest!"}
{"text":"They deliver and that made me so happy, but not to be too excited.  My biggest disappointment is the delivery time and how the food appears cold once we receive it. Perhaps, it would be best to just dine it because the food is pretty good. They also totally messed up a food order for delivery, which left one of us with nothing to eat while we waited an additional 45 minutes for the driver to return with correct order.  Bummer!"}
{"text":"Late dinner off of my diet (UGH!), but nonetheless we came for dinner while we were at the hospital across the street. I figured since I was venturing off of my diet that I'd go ahead and get a beer. Bianca helped us out. They had a DJ spinning some older rap joints and several TVs on playing games and ESPN coverage. There's an in-house bar and it seems as though they turn this pizza joint into a mini-club during later hours. While I was there I got the Pizza Blanco which came with white sauce, spinach, tomatoes and a white cheese. In addition to the pizza we got the Honey Hot wings and I washed it down with the rocky mountain freshness...Coors Light. Would have preferred a Kilt Lifter, but figured I'd at least keep it to a light beer. Had a good experience. Food was made fast and tasted great. I'd return here for sure to try out a different pie that they have and a different flavor of wings."}
{"text":"Terrible food, very rude staff, i ordered for delivery, after I received my food saw that my j poppers were bitten, called the lady back and she told me i am making it up. I asked for a refund and she said \"it doesnt work that way\"."}
{"text":"New York would be imbarresed if they knew about this pizza place. The pizza was tasteless. The wings were small and over cooked. Add the fact that it took over an hour to get to us and they are 0 for 3. Not even worth trying!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the pizza and wings with my family the other night. Food was good and priced reasonable. Seems like maybe more adult supervision is needed as our drinks went dry while  selfies were being taken behind the register.  The tip was less because of that and would of been 5 stars if not for that. We will give them another chance however."}
{"text":"A great spot for drinks and food with friendly staff. They have a DJ daily to get things started. In side siting and a patio out side not very crowded just stop on by with friends or a one man party."}
{"text":"I'm always interested in trying a local merchant.  But, as I approached to try Gus's New York Pizza, I saw a No Weapons sign near the front door.    Sorry, I stay out of businesses that only allow criminals to be armed.  As a law abiding citizen that has been background checked by the state and spends lots of money in restaurants, I'll honor the request to stay out and spend my cash somewhere else.  Defense free businesses are not safe for paying customers.    If the sign goes away, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really wish I had read the other comments before we came here. The bartender provided quick service but that was the extent of anything good about this place. First of all, the barstools are too low for the bar, which makes it very difficult to eat or even drink from.  I ordered the Cesar salad and added chicken. I also asked if they could toss the chicken in medium wing sauce. My husband ordered the BBQ burger with fries.  The bartender brought my salad out first. The salad had the chicken, lettuce and dressing all mixed together and had a small cup of wing sauce on the side. The bartender told me the cooks wouldn't put the chicken in the sauce. ...Ummmm.....what??... So, I asked her to just have them put the chicken on the side and I'll toss it in the sauce myself. She took it back to the kitchen where we could see the cook arguing with her about it.  She finally brought it back out with the chicken on the side and a cup of sauce. The lettuce and dressing were mixed in a bowl. I cut the chicken,  mixed it with the sauce and added it to the lettuce and dressing. I'm not sure what was so difficult about that but whatever. Problem solved.  About ten minutes later, my husband's burger finally came out. He ate a fry and commented if the burger is as bad as the fries,  this wasn't going to be good. He took a bite of his burger and said it wad a good thing there was BBQ sauce on it because there was no seasoning on the burger. He also ordered it medium well but it was way over cooked.  On top of all that, they charged a dollar for the wing sauce. Uneffingbelievable.  Quick update: My husband ended up throwing up shortly after we got home. In case we weren't sure before, we're definitely not returning now!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really loud rap playing.  WAY too loud.  We changed our order to be for take out,  then a little later the music changed and was turned down.  It took 25 minutes for our appetizet, but it was hot and tasty.  The pizza was another 15 minutes.  It was tasty but so soggy that the pieces fell apart when you tried to pick them up and the cardboard box was saturated through.  Then the waitress rang up our order wrong,  had to void and rering it and told us it would take two or three days for the void to clear.  So we left with $80 worth of charges on our card.  Never going back."}
{"text":"I was nervous about coming here due to some of the reviews, but after reading a lot of the bad reviews I decided that they were lame reviews (especially the one where a guy said he wouldn't eat there and gave 1 star only because there is a sign that says \"No Weapons Allowed\" on the door! Come on Yelp...you should pull that review!!!!). Food and service were both better than the 2.5 rating. Go ahead and don't be afraid of this place...it's pretty good. Plus, that dingbat that only wants to go places where people with guns are allowed won't be there waiting to draw his gun on you!"}
{"text":"This is our new go to pizza place, we love the pizza and the crispy crust.  The wings are great , we have never eaten at the restaurant as we always pick it up and bring it back home."}
{"text":"Just ordered from Gus' and was truly disappointed.  And they have the nerve to say they are \"Phoenix favorite pizza\"  What a farce!  The pizza was overpriced and the topping were scarce.  The wings were the driest wing I have ever tasted.  Truly disappointed and won't be ordering from them again.  I am sticking with Oregano's!"}
{"text":"A coworker ordered the New York Giant Pizza from this Gus's location. We waited an hour and a half for the pizza to be delivered, and then it was delivered cold. When she called back to discuss the pizza with them, she was told that the next pizza would be free. She said ok, and then hung up. We then decided that it would be nice to go ahead and have the hot pizza at this time. She called back and they charged her for the pizza, but not the delivery charge. She explained that was not what they told her would happen. She asked to speak with the manager, but was told that the manager was not in. The person at Gus's got very rude and hung up on her. We work at a business that orders out frequently. We will no longer order from this establishment. We also have at least 20 employees here today. This word of mouth, if each one of us even only tells 2 people that tell 2 people, will grow exponentially.  I personally am very disappointed in the lack of customer service that was shown to my coworker on her birthday. I will no longer order from Gus. I have 6 children. Think of the word of mouth this will grow to."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town, stopped in hoping for some Pizza and a cold beer.  Walked in to a few small groups of tables, the place was by no means busy. I sat at the bar and watched a couple guys walk around to and from the bar, honestly I'm not sure if they were bartenders or just waiters. I sat and watched them walk by for a solid 10 mins with out so much of a \"do you need a menu or a drink?\"   I gave up and left without even hearing a word from anyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried it yesterday. We stopped by for the all you can eat pizza lunch special. They advertise it as $4.99 ALL YOU CAN EAT pizza but the reality's that's just cheese pizza. If you want to add toppings to your pizza slices then it's 50cents per topping. We each had 3-4 slices with an extra topping on each of them.   The pizza itself's not bad. It's a very thin crust and it comes out hot (very hot). Our waitress stopped by frequently enough so we could keep ordering pizza whenever we wanted. The first order's 2 slices, the next ones come at 1 slice per order (I guess to avoid waste?). Anyway, the slices are HUGE. I ate 4 of them and I was so full the rest of the day.  I had green pepper, bacon and sausage (divided, one topping per slice, green pepper twice) and green pepper and bacon were my favorite. I found the sausage to be too salty for my taste but that's probably just a personal preference, though.  Overall, it's not a bad deal but it can get expensive if you want to add several toppings per slice. The place wasn't too packed and the staff was nice. It's an OK spot to get lunch if you're in a hurry because the food comes out quickly and it's affordable too."}
{"text":"Ordered take out Pizza and Wings this evening. Order came quicker than was stated in the confirmation email. The pepperoni pizza (hand tossed crust) was like I ordered it from back home, light with a slight crisp to the crust. Wings were cooked perfectly and meaty. The Gold Spicy sauce was wicked good too."}
{"text":"Very good service, food & drinks! Everything is very affordable. Our waitress was Rose she is the best! Definitely recommend this place, the manager is doing such a good job at this location."}
{"text":"Wings are the bomb.  Pizza is avg but if you  have  a big  crowd  to  feed then they have the size along with a great price!  Drinks are  always great during happy hour.   It can  get busy & really loud at times."}
{"text":"Ahhh..the love-hate relationship with Gus' Pizza.  Here's the thing--if you dine in the food is amazing--hot, fresh and always delcious.  If you order delivery, expect to wait 1.5 hours and get mediocre food since it has been sitting under a warmer for too long.   Every few months we try again thinking it will be better, but alas, always slow on delivery.  Bottom line is to dine-in."}
{"text":"No idea why so many bad reviews. This place is chill. Family friendly and the food is great. Music is good after hours. I'm Vegan and can still find great food here. The small dinner salad is made with great lettuce mushrooms onion tomato and the Italian dressing is so good. The waitresses are all super friendly..  Will continue coming."}
{"text":"\"Gus Pizza\".. Or should I call it \"Gross pizza\"..  Honestly, frozen pizza from grocery store had more flavors than their pizza!    I will make this short! If you want to grab few drinks, sure! If you wanna great pizza, visit your local grocery store or pizza delivery.  It will save your money and bad taste in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, not the best but delicious taste. My favorite pizza is the Spanish Harlem a bit more pricy but to me it is always totally worth it hehehe"}
{"text":"Came to eat and watch the game. Plenty of seating outside but had to wait 15 min. To put a drink order in. When she finally brought them we asked for menus and we're told it would be about 20 min. Before they will start talking food orders.  That they needed to catch up. WTH. Hire more cooks! Hungry and aggravated!"}
{"text":"I finally came here to try their pizza and it was decent. It was a big cheesy slice and it was only 2.50. I want to come back and try their \"Specialty Pizzas\" in hopes that will have more pow. They have a nice ambiance and great drink specials on Wednesdays! $3 martinis and wells. All in all, I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Tonight was one of those nights where I felt very anti-social, so I decided to order from a place where I could stay in my pajamas and order delivery online.  Gus's placed coupons literally on my doorstep weeks ago, so I gave it a try.  The website was easy to order from and my pizza was cooking in no time.  I thought I would sit back, prop my feet up, and binge-watch Netflix.  Nope, no go on the Netflix front because Gus's decided to call me not once, but twice with questions.  First call: they needed clarification on my building number and the gate code.  Fine, but not knowing my building number, she made me walk outside to look.  I do not have a building number.  She said, with so much nasty attitude, that the driver would call if he got lost.  Should have done that in the first place.  Second phone call, sauce could not be put half and half on my wings.  What sauce do I want?  WHY would your website provide the half and half option if it is not an option?    Turns out I had plenty of time to binge watch my show after that.  Pizza was delivered cold, but with a very apologetic driver.  Maybe it was my missing building number?  Who knows.    Alright, now to review my food:  Pizza: Beautiful, but cold and crust was dry and sauce was barely there to make up for it.  This pizza was not tasty.  Wings: Wow!  My boneless wings with medium sauce were delicious!  The breading on the tender chicken soaked up that spicy buffalo sauce and mmmmmm.  After I finished the wings, thankfully, I was full enough that there was no reason to eat the lousy pizza.  It's unlikely, but I may come back for more chicken wings."}
{"text":"They trespassed my gated community and trespassed my property by taping a copy of their menu to my front door.  When I called to complain, there was no supervisor or manager on duty.  I ought to contact the police department, but instead I'll just post this review on yelp.  I won't be patronizing this illegal business."}
{"text":"Good pizza and cute place!"}
{"text":"I went online expecting to get a menu and then have to call in the order.  But it was so easy to order online and I was even able to pay online too!  I really love that because it's always hard to order with hungry, loud kids in the background!  Super happy!"}
{"text":"Pizza pie dough is made fresh daily and hand tossed!!! Nice and crispy like authentic NY pie!!! Wings are fall off the bone delicious! Great friendly staff and the new owners are really making an effort to make this a great neighborhood/ community restaurant!"}
{"text":"I guess I should have read the reviews before I ordered!  Pizza was not great but I forced it down cuz I was starving from traveling all day!  Chicken wings were dry. Could not chew them. Garlic rolls were burned. Super fast delivery though. Would not order again! See picture of dry burned garlic rolls below."}
{"text":"This is an ordinary pizza joint with fantastic delivery options.  Not many places will deliver at 1am or later.  We have used them a few times at my place of business and they work with our 24 hour schedule."}
{"text":"This place is bad!!! Service is not good ordered a chicken tenders for my girls and it took 25 mins... Had to remind the waitress for drink fills... Staff just walked around and ignored us.... Skip this place... Peter Piper is better!!"}
{"text":"I don't know a simple we are closed will be fine but the server was rude out of line was said we're fucking close. when the hours clear  state that they close at midnight nite. it's unfortunate to know that such a fine stablemate has inept serves. I will rate a 0 but that's not in option"}
{"text":"Okay, give me break. Wait a half hour for the stupid garlic knots, pretty much ready to leave, and they finally arrive burned.  What do we get told?  Oh they do that intentionally so it won't be raw.   Really?  So the table to our left, theirs is NOT burned because.....why exactly?  The server was lovely, polite and helpful.   But this is NOT the first time the owner has been a dick to us. After multiple visits I have to believe he has some sort of issue with gender or appearance.   The \"upgrade\" to two stars is for the server being nice.   Otherwise, this place is a zero. Go to a different location.  Maybe a different franchisee will result in less horrid behavior.   The food can be tasty but expect to wait a VERY long time to get it. That is a consistent trait here.  At least for us.   Good luck!"}
{"text":"Having gone to the Goodyear location multiple times, I assumed that this location would be very close to the real deal. sadly I was mistaken. I ordered two Italian subs and was extremely irritated that I sat in there and waited for over 20 minutes when the only other person inside there was a couple sitting at the bar. The individual behind the counter was paying more attention to the bartender and some other employees that were also doing absolutely nothing then he was about making my sandwiches. First of all I had about three tomatoes on my sandwich they were cut so thick!  The owner is seriously losing money if he continues to allow his employees to make those kinds of sandwiches, such a waste. My kid could make a better sandwich. Definitely not the same care and attention as the Goodyear location. This place is more like a bar and getting bar food. I won't be visiting this location again I'll stick to the Goodyear place."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed by this place. Slow, curt, unfriendly service during a day with few other patrons. The pizza cheese/ sauce/ crust ratio is way off. Very cheap ingredients makes for sloppy slices. The fountain drink tasted like cleaning solution. The bill was higher than I expected and perhaps the biggest indication of terrible business, When I brought this to the lady bar tender, nothing was done to remedy the situation. She just took my $ and did not blink an eye. No apology. Thanked me for letting her know the Sprite was off. Don't bother with this place. They are too busy giving NY pizza a bad name."}
{"text":"Great place to have a beer and just unwind, the pizza is great and what a deal they have for lunch $5.99 all you can eat pizza there are more locations then the one on 91st Ave. unfortunately they are all independently owned and operated the pizza very's from restaurant to restaurant"}
{"text":"I just left a bar that was it at and two of Their street people that were out trying to sell pizzas and wings or in the front of the bar smoking weed how unprofessional is that I am not going to definitely buy anything to eat from somebody that was sitting outside doing drugs that's very embarrassing"}
{"text":"Great Pizza! The crust is just crispy enough and the pizza is not loaded with sauce. We ordered a 16 inch pepperoni pizza for 4 and it came out within 20 minutes. Server was nice and made sure our drinks were topped off. As the Cardinal season has begun, we will visit Gus's Pizza more often."}
{"text":"We came upon this pizza place by accident...looking for a place to eat on a Friday nite and long waits everywhere we went.  Really just came in for a drink and ended staying for pizza and beer.  Great place...pizza is yummy.  We also tried the boneless wings and greek salad-all very tasty.  Has a dive bar feel (which I like) and has fun happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"It has gotten alot better in terms of service and manegmant. The pizza is good. I earlier gave it 1 star service but since then they have improved."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice, and those times I really loved it  their pizza  is really good, it's thin but delicious"}
{"text":"Love the pete-zer. Although going to any Gus' pete-zer is like going to the zoo. You can see back into the kitchen, and they are acting like animals. I don't care about having fun at work, but when you are playing grab ass, cursing and lol'ing so loud that people stop chewing and look around, hide the kitchen."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and medicore food.  We had a flyer on our door with a coupon for XL 1 - topping and 20 wings for 21.99.  Not an uncommon special.  We got our pizza with 10 wings and no sauce on them all.  No problem, call to have them correct and they say that they don't have a special like that.  They called me a liar.  Said the flyer was old.  May have been a couple of months old, but there was no expiration date.  Nothing was said when I called and order 20 wings.  This is just bait and switch.  I will never order from them again and will make sure my neighbors know too."}
{"text":"We had a good pepperoni and mushroom pizza  the night before we left on vacation in Goodyear .  Our server Racheal was nice as she made our visit  there  a pleasure"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. This was one of my favorite spots until yesterday. My husband and I walked in and the bartender that works Thursday nights told us that she would only serve us one drink. I asked y and said because the last 2 times we were there I complained about the bill.  Yes I complained because she added someone else's drinks on my tab. Not paying someone else's drink. Did they take off the drinks that were added? No they did not. I still paid. We were mistreated and handled this situation terribly. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL."}
{"text":"Excellent Happy Hour deals on beer. Buy one, get one for a penny. 16 oz draft PBRs $1.50 during happy hour! Their breaded mushrooms are average bar food, pizza was just okay - not enough seasoning, garlic knots were huge and delicious. The place was kind of empty and had a weird vibe as if everyone else in there was a friend of the proprietor. Not sure I'll go back...maybe."}
{"text":"The wait staff appears to be fresh out of junior high.. Fried mushrooms were brought to my table frozen, the wings are also cheap frozen quality. Looks like a crappy hangout for the neighborhood. I felt like a minority (i'm not mexican..)"}
{"text":"My folks live in Phoenix so we came to visit. First time here and I have to say, I really enjoyed their pizza. The cheese they use and the sauce is excellent. The crust was very buttery which I enjoyed.   The cons: it's really really loud here so if you're the type that likes a sports bar, terrible Nicki Minaj type music and waitresses that look like they smoked meth, this is your place.   My rating will be on the pizza only. Next time I visit, I'm getting my food to go."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Phoenix and was looking for a pizza place nearby so I found Gus's. I was a little hesitant as first (since it wasn't the most highly reviewed on Yelp) but I gave it a try and I loved it! I found out that it's recently under new management and they told me that they're revamping the menu. My boyfriend and I split the Spanish Harlem pizza, chicken fettuccine Alfredo and the seafood sampler. It was delicious!!! My server was awesome and we had a great time watching the games. They have like a millions TVs in the place and had $4 mugs  of domestic beer during the game. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great place, good pizza and cold beer.  They always have sports on and are always friendly.  Go here often you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"I know better than to ever eat Gus's pizza. It's the same crappy chain that thrives near Arizona State, and you're better off dipping saltines in tomato paste. That being said, THIS Gus's (please, learn to freaking use apostrophes) has a freaking sweet sports bar setup going on.   Outdoor TVs, and outdoor bar seating where you can watch a game while AC is blasting out at you, replacing the muggy summer heat. Sound is very high quality. Staff is abundant, swift, and kind. Beer selection is OK. This isn't my usual part of town, but I'll for sure be back to watch some gridiron with my pals. And order items that aren't pizza from the menu."}
{"text":"Been here once before and the food (pizza) was great, and the service (Marissa L) was OK. 3 weeks later, same server,  service was below average and the pizza was awful. It wasn't very busy and the servicewas very slow. Waiting 10+minutes for drinks and 30+minutes for 2 slices of pizza. I can clearly see that this is old pizza. There was a layer of old cheese, topped with a small layer of fresh cheese to make it look good. As a server myself, there is no way in hell I would let this go out to my tables. The entire experience was disappointing and I don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna give a 1 Star cuz stuff happens, but if you guys couldn't be bothered to refresh your Grubhub menu.  1 hour+ after I ordered and the best you got is a half apology of whoops my bad.  It'll be there in regular delivery time.   I didn't give you 1 star cuz I don't want to be that guy.  And I've liked your food in the past.  Maybe this will be the review to pay attention to other ways of making business.  GrubHub!  Pay attention! It's so much easier to order and make specifications on there.  Good Luck"}
{"text":"Flies everywhere up front. Seriously, at the bar, there must have been 20-30 buzzing around. Put up some damned flypaper, or get an air screen. Something.  Horrible waitress. She poured my beer till it overflowed, then just let the foam settle, then handed it to me, without topping it off, or wiping the glass.  We moved to a table, because we didn't want the flies to get in the wings we ordered.  On the way to our table, the waitress dropped plate, which shattered, causing broken shards of plate to hit me in the face. Seriously. She didn't say a word.  After we ate the wings, which were good enough to make me not hate having to give the one star, she came and asked if I wanted more water. I said no, I'm ok. She took my water! It wasn't empty, and I didn't ask her to remove it! WTF?!  Also, the men's bathroom was in disrepair, and smelled awful. The toilet appeared to be non-functional, there were tools and parts all over the floor, no sign on the door indicating a problem, nothing.  What a disaster that whole experience turned out to be! This place is definitely going on my \"Never Return\" list!"}
{"text":"Had the meatball sandwich and it was a little spicy.  The sandwich was a little dry and could have used more sauce.  I was a little worried when they asked me if I wanted white or wheat bread.  I didn't know that they had wheat Italian bread.  Oh and they forgot to season my fries...blugh!!!  I probably will go back."}
{"text":"First time we ever ordered our food came an hour later than it was supposed to. When we called they got angry instead of apologetic. Then we found out the manager wasn't even around. They even hung up on me!   Our food finally showed up and it was cold and gross and also got the order wrong!!! So I stopped by after we finished working and the manager still wasn't there. So I complained to whoever was there and they were a little nicer but still condescending and it turned out to be the guy I talked to on the phone that hung up on me. He said that he thought the conversation was over, however I was still talking and he just hung up. I told him I didn't appreciate being hung up on when I was trying to contain my frustration and wasn't being rude at all and finally agreed to give me a voucher for the same amount we initially paid. However they left such a bad taste in my mouth I never went back to use the voucher. It was not our fault at all that they delivered the food late and cold, and wrong! And it wasn't just about the order mess up, it was the way they handled it or lack of handling it. Won't be trying them ever again."}
{"text":"Do not come here for a quick lunch! The all you can eat pizza for 4.99 is brought out by the slice, can only have 1 topping a piece, can only be ordered 2 at a time takes 20 minutes to get out to table, and the music is too loud! We will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the salad here. A very casual atmosphere. Pizza used to be better. Wings are good! I like mine double fried. They deliver which I like on my lazy days."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with my food tonight. The first time I came it was great experience and the food not bad, loved the Spivey (cookie) Tonight very different,  I find an eyelash in my side salad and my pesto chicken pasta tasted like \"salty\" Pesto pasta. To say the least I didn't eat the salad and only a few bites of Pesto pasta. The server Iana was very kind and said she'd ask her manager if she would take off something. Never saw the manager but I got my ticket and everything was on it without a nickel being taken off. I didn't even get an apology! Wow!!!! I won't be back."}
{"text":"A hang tag on my front door boasting \"Best of New Times Pizza\" brought me to the newly opened Gus's at Union Hills and Utopia. Set back a bit from the road and with only a temporary sign out front, this place is easy to overlook. It's disappointing that mediocre food and ambiance will most likely continue to keep this spot from standing out.  One server / bartender/ to-go person seemed to be all the upfront staff on hand; needless to say, service was slow. To her credit, she remained unflustered and friendly despite the conditions. With three dudes mostly standing around in the semi-open kitchen, it would have been nice if one of them had yelled out a \"Welcome!\" or stepped out to help.  Gus's food menu isn't too surprising, but in addition to pizza it has all of the meaty sandwiches and finger-licking fried foods you expect (and love!) from a bar menu. For me, the wings and pizza were just OK, but a generous beef gyro and perfectly cooked fries really hit the spot.  The interior is pretty sparse, with just a few TVs on the otherwise bare walls. Despite its billing as a bar, the bar area is small and offers a limited choice of beverages. One of the few beers on tap was out, and we were mystified as we watched our server pour soft drinks and mixers from 2-liter bottles.   With so few indie eateries in the area, I always have high hopes for new restaurants. Unfortunately, Gus's seems to be struggling before it even gets noticed."}
{"text":"Always great friendly service!! Love the Gold spicy wings!! Yum! So crispy always cooked so perfect! The sauce on the pizza is so good. Love the openness, love the music and love variety of the different events they offer every night. Best Gus's around! Even becomes a dance party on the weekends"}
{"text":"The food it's excellent and the service was excellent the place very clean very nice I give it five stars because it was the best pizza I have anywhere in Glendale."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, the best wings and pizza. Always great service!! Highly recommend, i come here on Sundays for away Cardinal games, and the food has made made me come more often. I love it!!!"}
{"text":"A fun unique spot on the the West Side- affordable drinks and lots of TV's for games/fights.  Good happy hour spot for after work w/ a few friends."}
{"text":"Wow. Just ordered a pizza and was told who was boss. Not the customer. She told me to take the price difference from usual and stick it. You must have had a coupon the last couple times you ordered. No, it's always that price. Eat cake, asshole. What a mouth. I'm new, but I've worked here for five years. Which one is it? Can't have both. I love the flavor of the crust. Not the attitude of the new temp worker."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Gus' Pizza. Ordered online through Grub Hub. I liked the texts letting me know what time it would be ready. When we got there I discovered it's a little sports bar. There was a football game on and it was noisy! The clapping and cheers just echoed throughout the room. I would never want to eat in there. But we got our 16\" half cheese, half pepperoni pizza and garlic cheese bread. It was still warm by the time we got home. I thought the food had really good flavors. I enjoyed the seasoning in the marinara sauce. The garlic bread is not what I thought it would be, but I still liked it. It looked like a smaller pizza, except it was like pita bread instead of pizza crust, with a thick layer of cheese and some garlic butter. Tasted good. I was not disappointed with the pizza here."}
{"text":"I liked the pizza, good sauce. I ordered the All you can eat New York Style Pizza lunch special. The mushrooms on my pizza was raw, the other ingredients were just throw only, yet the pizza was cooked all the way.  May as well gotten frozen pizza.  Ok, not a superfan."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner. Was not a busy night for them so we did not have any service issues mentioned in some of the other post. Food was good not great"}
{"text":"delicious, we're regulars but I think these items have to be our favorite.  Canzone w black olives.  chicken parm, sometimes meatball, always w sweet potato fries. the tiramisu is homemade heaven I wish was a bigger piece. pizza is good and wings.  I just know what I like there"}
{"text":"While waiting to get a tattoo we decided to drive a mile down the road to grab a bite to eat. We should've went to McDonald's. The food is VERY low quality. Everything tasted prefrozen and cheap. I ordered a pizza, that honestly tasted like a frozen pizza from walmart. My partner got a chicken pasta dish and it was not good either. I will give this place one thing. The service was good, our waitress was great and prompt. However good service doesn't make up for the  crappy food. We won't be returning"}
{"text":"I'd give less than 1 star but I can't... called ordered and assumed everything was great as I was told my pizza would be to me in 30-45 mins I've a hour goes by without a call or anything so call to check and they inform me oh your order didn't meet our minimum so we didn't process it so now I've been without pizza for over a hour and it's to late to order from anywhere else because I waited on them... DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR SERVICE YOU'D BE BETTER OFF GOING HUNGRY..."}
{"text":"I phoned the order in and picked it up since it was only 5 minutes away.   The pep and mushroom was alright, not as much toppings and not as thin and crispy as expected, but still good. The supreme was much better as the toppings were piled on. Both had enough cheese and sauce too. I would go back and eat there to try it fresh out of the oven."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5-6 times and very single time I come it's either we ran out of wings or we ran out of michelada mix. The servers always have an attitude and are rude. The service is slow even when they are not busy. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Came to this place at 8 at night during the week and ordered a mini pizza and calzone for my fiance and a burger for myself. Really good food and the man that was there was extremely nice."}
{"text":"Please open one of these in Seattle!!!!! Best pizza in 10 years! Maybe 20. Late night we showed up with 15 people and they accommodated us easily and made some of the best pizza around! Do NOT miss out on this place"}
{"text":"Worst pizza in the area and I paid 86$ for two pizza and they were so bad we couldn't eat them and the kids wouldn't eat them this place is the worst !! Don't waste your time or money with this place I really wish I could get my money back thanks for letting me show up at a Super Bowl party with the worlds worst pizza I mean little ceasers beats this place 10000%!! Go there and save yourself 100$!!!!"}
{"text":"So done with this place! Just has progressively got worse and worse! Since when do you put sauce on a pizza that's made for pasta? Chunky sauce??? Wings were dry and over cooked almost chocked on them! Got two pizzas one had a ton of cheese on it compared to the other one. That was my issues with this place never know what your gonna get! After tonight I know they will never get another dime of my money and thank god I won't get awful food from this place!"}
{"text":"Very tasty. Both my husband and I left happy. I had pizza, he had a calzone. The dough was delicious. His calzone was the prettiest we've ever seen. We will be back. Glad we tried it."}
{"text":"We just had our pizza delivered (along with wings & other item. Total bill $41+). Opened the box and crawling along the inside was this insect. They offered to send out another pizza (1st order took 1.5 hours to receive). They refused to give a refund but offered a $10.00 credit. UNACCEPTABLE!"}
{"text":"The pizza was nasty wings had no sauce but the worse part was the service couldn't get a refill or any kind of attention!! Never coming here again took one bite of my pizza ate one wing paid my tab and left!"}
{"text":"We've been going there for urine have up until about 6 months ago and then now we went in today creating their pizza from Adriana and her husband and found out that their new owners as of 3 months ago probably the worst service and the worst pizza that I've ever ate my life Adriana have the best with Gus's pizza the way it was before and it will be forever missed because we're not going back"}
{"text":"My husband and I came for lunch. The server Kelley suggested the all you can eat special. The pizza was very good and the service was exceptional"}
{"text":"The pizza is NY style, and it's pretty damn good.  But the best thing about this pizza?  The fact you can get it at 3am.  They're trying to get a little piece of the 2-3am pie that Jack in the Box currently has a stronghold on.  I just wish I still lived in the Trillium apartments down the street from here.  It's a little further drive for me now but worth it when you're craving late night pizza.  The guys that work there were really nice and friendly as well."}
{"text":"No never again there more of a bar then pizza joint. The pizza was dry. To me it was like a little Caesars pizza but worse not even exaggerating. I'm really mad that I even tried this place. Never would have thought pizza would be that bad for 11$ for a medium."}
{"text":"Guess when they are busy they don't take pickup orders. Called 4-5 times and no answer. Usually order to have my bf pick up on his way home he drove by to get food else where and said looked busy. Takes me 2 seconds to order our pizza guess we will take our service else where."}
{"text":"My and Husband and I had a late late Monday dinner. We were passing Gus's on the way home. Saw the OPEN sign. Ok lets stop for a beer. Thinking its 1:15am maybe they are closed. Saw a few people at the bar. Awesome! Guess They are open till 2. Awesome for a Monday! Walk in yes there are a few people at the bar with full beers. But immediately girl bartenders yell WE ARE CLOSED!! Ummm ok.... Walk straight out. No biggie... We know its late. But seeing the bar had others with full beers. Thought they could of served us A beer too. We would of tipped good. Never been here we were more curious about the atmosphere, crowd, staff etc. we always pass here on way to other outings. No times were posted that we saw on the outside. And yelp says they are open till 4AM which obviously is not true. Any-who we give a neutral review. Cant say we like this place or not. But maybe another day/night we will stop in."}
{"text":"I ordered two pizzas and 12 wings for delivery at 6:15 on a Friday night. At 7:30 my order still hadn't arrived yet, so I called to find out where it was. I was told the driver couldn't find my apartment so he had left?? So I told them again where my apartment was. About 8 pm, I get another call saying the delivery man can't find my apartment, and the manager promises to take 25% off my bill. Finally the delivery guy calls me, and I have to walk out and guide him to my apartment, which is located in the building number I gave them when I ordered. He offers some lame excuse about looking at every other building in the complex, then assures me that his boss will take care of me regarding the bill. I give him a generous tip for his trouble and he leaves. The Pizza is so-so, the wings are lukewarm. The manager never takes anything off the bill and the full amount is charged. I don't even like waiting two hours for excellent pizza, so this was just depressing, and then we had to pay the full amount anyways. So yeah, I'll never order from here again. The dumbest part of the whole experience is this: we called this pizza place because they left a flyer on the door of our apartment. I just figured if they could find it once, they could find it again to deliver our pizza. Boy, was I wrong!! You can get far better pizza with much less drama. Might as well pass on this place."}
{"text":"Have been eating in here for almost two years.  Pizza and especially their wings always good.  Huge place..show UFC fights and Dj most nights...always stop by when we are in the area.  Our good friend Boom is always here..he loves this place too!"}
{"text":"Ok I ordered delivery today. $30 of food all thrown in the trash. Burger- tasted like a big meatball like they added breadcrumbs etc to the meat patties. So gross. Greek Gyro: thin store bought gyro meat same as I could have bought in the grocery store. That alone made it not worth $8 Curly fries: soggy Onion rings: over fried and very greasy - inedible Honey BBQ wings: dry dry dry under all the gooey sauce. Dry. Let me say that again. Dry. Took a bite of two wings and tossed them. A waste of money, for real. I regret spending $30 on such garbage. Could have gone to a real restaurant and had a nice meal!!!! I don't even want to know what their pizza tastes like. If it's anything like the rest if it, run the other way."}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time as they were delivery and I was feeling lazy. Spent almost $60. The food arrived about 90 minutes later. The food arrived in Styrofoam trays and they were put in hot without an insulator, which melted the Styrofoam to the food. Every one of the trays were burnt through. They are incredibly slow like Gordon Ramsey Kitchen Nightmare slow so nothing was hot.  Appetizers:  Jalapeño poppers tasted musty not fresh and cold. 0 stars  Mozzarella sticks tasted like the frozen ones you get at Walmart , and cold. 2 stars  Chicken Nugget/Strips also frozen from Walmart, and cold. 1 star  Onion rings were good, if they were frozen I want to know where they got them. They were good but also cold.  Meals  Chipotle burger was burned on the outside (which was ok) and mushy on the inside (which was not ok).  Gyro was ok, pita needed heating, tasted like a cheap Chinese copy.  Pizza was lukewarm as was everything else, I did not like it but my 11 year old kids did.  In summary it is bar food, if you have been drinking it will taste great and you won't notice it took an hour to get it and cost 3 times what a typical bar sells for. If you are not drinking the wait is to long and you realize that the value is not there. In my opinion they should serve alcohol for free to raise their ratings."}
{"text":"It wasn't even crowded and the food took forever, the service was super slow and the wings were over cooked and nasty! Won't be coming back to this place again!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way home from University of Phoenix stadium, the music was bumping to an empty restaurant on a Saturday night.  The waitress said to seat ourselves which we did and we waited a short time to order drinks.  That's where the good part ends.  We waited appx 15 min for drinks, watched some football and waited for a waitress to return. We couldn't believe that we were overlooked because there was only one person seated at the bar and 2 tables outside. We ordered Applebees online,waited left $10 with a 50 cent tip for the waitress. There are too many other places that are hungry for customers.  What's with the industrial fans inside of the restaurant?  Can't afford to turn on the AC?  What a joke for a restaurant, good location for football games but terrible service.  I'll stay with the other places at Westgate from now on. They never came over to take our food order or ask if we wanted another beer."}
{"text":"This is the worse place I have ever been, the service was terrible. The server did not look like she cared about her job.  The wings were beyond gross, McDonald's has better wings than them. The wings were so bad that they got me super sick and I was throwing up all night. I would never go back or recommend to go there."}
{"text":"I don't review unless given a legit reason, no need to rant. Called for delivery. My order was processed, delivery driver called and said that they don't deliver to my address conveniently 10 Minutes before they close. I called the establishment to see where the mixup was and my call was answered and immediately hung up. I'll make sure the hotel knows not to recommend this place for future reference."}
