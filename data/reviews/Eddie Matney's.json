{"text":"Ah, one of my favorites in my hometown phoenix.  i don't get back from sf much, but i go here when i can get back.  and eddie is always there to make sure everything's allright.  since he had his place 'couscous' before this, he's been a perfectionist, his hand in every dish (well, not literally).  anyhow, the food is always a treat.  it's an occassionally changing menu and though i'm out of touch with my dessert home, rest assured the deserts are consistently amazing and it really seems like one of the better and lesser known bangs for the buck in phx."}
{"text":"I was really upset when Eddie Matney's closed...but his new restaurant on Indian School and Marshall Way is even better! If you liked Eddie Matney's, you'll love Eddie's House. And even if you didn't like Eddie Matney's, I'd be willing to bet you'll still have a good time at Eddie's House. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"I agree.  You can't go wrong here.  Where else can you get deep fried dough balls for dessert?  Decadant.  Great choice for business lunches or happy hour after work.  Big portions.  I would call this upscale comfort food with a twist.  Outstanding desserts."}
