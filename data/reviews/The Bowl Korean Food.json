{"text":"I usually order the combo special of the day ($5.99-7.99). The meal is big enough for me to split into 2. It also comes with a small side of kimchi which you take yourself from the fridge. Combos come with miso soup, salad and jap chae (glass noodles). The fish/pork cutlets are huge and a lot of rice accompanies it.   This is one of my go-to spots for lunch in St. Clair Centre. It's located in the food court, lower level. Tucked away behind a Chinese fast food place."}
{"text":"This review is about the service and about the vegetarian bibimbap.  Bibimbap, which is mushrooms, spinach, bean sprouts, carrots, sunny side egg and some other goodies on a top of rice with sweet-hot sauce comes at 9$, at Fridays at 8$, which has to be the cheapest way in town too fill your stomach with tasty and healthy food. The dish comes with kimchi and miso soup. It is enough, maybe even too much, to fully fill one hungry man's stomach.  If you want the vegetarian version, as I do, just tell them you don't want the meat. The 8$ or 9$ price only applies to the vegetarian version.  The service is very polite. You can eat it there or take it out. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Decent Korean place in the St Clair Centre. I had the Bologogi Beef Box, which was on special for $9. It took awhile to come, but boy was it alot of food. It came with dumplings, salad, soup, rice, some ban-chan (noodles) and the beef itself. It was pretty decent and very good value for the price."}
{"text":"There's a giant sign wrapped around the counter advertising milk tea, smoothies & juices. Went to order a beverage and the cashier gave a puzzled look before informing me that \"we don't have those.\""}
{"text":"Pork Katsu meal is so delicious. Thin sliced and batterred and deep fried to its best. 7 dollars on Thursdays, with lots of rice, some salad and stir fried noddles, kimchi.  It is right at the food court where the St Clair subway is, neighboring a public washroom. I would not sit down and eat there, but man the food was good. I would go all the time if I happen to be there or work near by and get take outs from it. Not worth the trip from far away, though. It is nothing fancy. But remember you pay 7 dollars plus tax."}
{"text":"The lady at the cash told me to F*off and not to come back when all I wanted was an extra container for rice. I asked for the manager and she said she's the manager. What kind of a manager who tells you to fuck off? I've been coming to this place since day 1 and have been a customer longer that she's been working there."}
