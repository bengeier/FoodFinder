{"text":"I have been here a lot of times, and every single time i visit, there is one major problem. 

\"Service\"

Their food quality is reasonable and their menu price is pretty much average range. 

Servers never come back to your table. I had to help my self to get side plates, utensils, napkins, and I see other customers having same problem. 

It is so typical that Korean restaurant usually don't care about the customer service, but I never had to literley stand up, and walk to their station to grab what I needed. 

Their servers comes in for their shift, and don't even bother washing their hand, and all they do is out on their apron. One young guy server walked in after smoking and he served our food right after he walked in. 

They belive that most of Korean young adult customers don't tip them well, and they serve us poorly but they should know that their tip comes from their service feedback. 

Lack of customer care, customer service, and food handler knowledge. 

deserves 1/5 for their restaurant"}
{"text":"FOOD: Mainly traditional Korean food (most I don't understand). I typically stick with the basics: bibimbap, pork bone soup, jajangmyeon, kimchi/tofu stew. All very delicious. They also give you plenty of side dishes (as any good Korean restaurant should). 

SERVICE: extremely friendly and attentive service. There are two sections in the restaurant. We are always placed in the \"foreigners\" area so I'm not sure what service is like on the other side... or even how to get access to the other side. But it's a large restaurant, and I've never seen it busy. 

COST: Ranges from $10 - $30 depending on what you're in the mood for. Some items on the menu are pricey, but I imagine they are sharing options.

OVERALL: Korean food with an asian twist. Great food, good atmosphere, free parking, and in the same plaza as a korean bakery (desser anyone?... yum!)."}
{"text":"This is my fav spot for Kam Jang Tang ( Pork Bone Soup) in the West end ( Ka Chi in Chinatown is my fav). The broth is always bubbling hot and the green perilla seeds garnished on top really adds a lot flavour to the soup base. There's a lot of meat on the pork bones- some people find it a hassle
to pick off the meat, but I think that's half the fun! I'm knocking off a star as it's not as spicy as I would like and the other items i've tried on the menu have been average."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem for Korean food in Mississauga. It is one of my favorite places to go when I am craving for some reasonably priced Korean food. Every time I come here, I always order jajangmyun (black bean noodles with veggies and beef). Filling and tasty - you cannot go wrong for $6.50 (though somehow everytime I go its $4.99 on the daily special). And I keep coming back here for the jajangmyun specifically.

They also have a variety of other dishes that taste quite good, including pork bone soup. I would love to try their apps and set menup 100% authentic and Korean run. Service is a bit slow however so that docks a star.

There is quite some competition as there are lots of other Korean places in this area but if you have not tried this place, I would encourage you to do so!"}
{"text":"- randomly found this place while cruising for korean in 'sauga. this is 100% a hole in the wall no frills joint 
- place was full of expats and lots of korean being spoken which tells me it's legit.
- pork bone soup was excellent... but was missing the potato... which is ok... as i think i got an extra few pieces of spine :)
- kimchi side dish was very spicey.... again....a sign of things being legit here.
- parking lot is in the back... entrance is on dundas."}
{"text":"I really don't know how this restaurant scored such high reviews. It's terrible. I don't usually like to say bad stuff about a family run joint, but they are BAD.

A summary of all things that went wrong:

-Service was unfriendly.
-Service was really slow.
-We asked for water for the entire table and got 1 glass for the entire party of 5.
-We ordered vegetarian rice and specified no meat or seafood and it came with seafood. The waitress was not apologetic and took no action to remedy the situation. They asked us to eat around it or wait TWENTY minutes to get a new one. We got a $2 discount off our bill for this mishap.
-We ordered a mild soup and it was spicier than ever.
-We ordered a vegetarian pajeon instead of one with seafood ($15), and they charged us the price of the seafood pancake.

Overall, a terrible experience. The restaurant is slow, service is terrible and the quality of the food is really mediocre. If you want good Korean in Mississauga, go to Buk Chang Soon Dubu."}
{"text":"Korean food seems to be a new found love for me, I've had it in the past but I don't think I truly appreciated its tastefulness. 

Last night, I was blessed with coming into contact with this Mississauga restaurant, with my girlfriend and her family. Have little to no knowledge of what's good at this restaurant, my girlfriends family, who come here often saved me by ordering their favourite dishes. The experience I have with Korean is bibimbap, the most common of dishes, or the pork bone soup, so I was in uncharted seas, so to speak. I wasn't disappointed in the slightest by their choices. Was very impressed with the foods served at this restaurant, wasn't able to snap pictures of all the dishes due to everyone digging in so fast. Service was also a plus, even though they were speaking Korean, I got a very friendly vibe from the conversations with our table. 

Safe to say I'll most definitely be coming back to this restaurant, even if it is a bit of a drive, the food was worth it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Korean restaurant in mississauga. Very reasonble price and high quality of food.  I have been there 3 or 4 times now, service is very good as the owner always ask us if we want to refill our side dishes. They normally have four types of side dishes, all taste fresh and good. I specifically love thier Kimchi, not too sour or spicy, the taste is just right. I will defintely recommend this place to anyone who love Korean food."}
{"text":"Crossed the 'border' to Mississauga today - visited with friends there in the morning.

Stopped at this place for lunch  - and I was very impressed with the quality of the cham-pong.  The noodles were good, copious amounts of seafood (generous amounts of squid, shrimp and the usual mussel); the broth was very deep and rich tasting.  Panchan was typical Chungsik panchan - i.e. kimchi, yangpa (onion) with black bean sauce and daikon.

I chatted with the staff in Korean and ... and miraculously, some odeng and kamja appeared as part of the panchan.  It has been a while since I had a good champong.  The waiter was friendly and polite - it was a good experience overall."}
{"text":"This is one of the few Korean Chinese restaurants in the area so even if the food here isn't great, you don't have many options. The fried dumplings were pretty good as was the jampong that I got to sample although it's really spicy. The complimentary kimchi is just as spicy. The rest of the side dishes I'm not a fan of. The tangsoyok was pretty much like sweet and sour pork and it was pretty good. Still it was strangely pricy compared to a lot of the other dishes. Lastly, I got the bibimbap which was actually kind of bad. The sauce it came with was all spice no flavour. Also something was off with the rice."}
