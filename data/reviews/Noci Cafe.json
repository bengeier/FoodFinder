{"text":"Very quaint restaurant with nicest owners. You can't find another restaurant that makes home made bread, and all dishes from scratch for the prices. We both got chicken parm and meatball parm plate. They came with home made bread and salad with home made dressing. Sauce is made from scratch and both meats cooked perfect. Recommend it to anyone :)"}
{"text":"Excellent. A gem of a cafe. Great service all around, a relaxed atmosphere and a really great family/friend business. The menu is insanely reasonably priced up and down, and they have a rotating list of specials on the board.   I ordered the Spicy Italian panini (one of the specials) and it was utterly loaded with meat, with delicious bread and crisp fries. Full of flavour and perfectly balanced with cheese and sauces, i  was STUFFED for $9. My girlfriend got a scrambled egg sandwich that was on special and she was jaw dropped. Blown away! The bacon was the tastiest she's ever tried.  All in all, really great meal. Recommend to anyone, won't disappoint."}
{"text":"They make fresh breads (wheat, sourdough, multi-grain, etc) on-site, along with homemade jams.    This is an awesome little breakfast spot that packs a whole lot of passion into everything they make, with great service and very reasonable prices (my Florentin omelette, a special for today, is $9).    Note that for summer, they close at 2:00pm."}
{"text":"Had a coupon and decided to stop in with Gil for lunch.  Nice little place, obviously family run.  Tasty, clean, great service.  Will definitely return and try a pastry!"}
{"text":"Best Greek omelette ever and hash browns are atypically good! Friendly and attentive staff. Perfect cafe for a simple meet up with anyone."}
{"text":"Hands down, best breakfast I have had in the area. Unique hash browns, eggs done right and fresh baked bread for the toast. Definitely get the homemade jam!   Friendly, family owned place. The chef knows what they are doing in that kitchen."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in town. They have great food and great people. Love the bacon egg and cheese sandwich!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  A small gem amongst the HUGE selection of breakfast places in the area. I'm picky and would just prefer to cook my own breakfast, but this place has yet to disappoint. It's simple and delicious with healthy options. The owners take so much pride in their restaurant and it shows. It almost takes you back in time with the owners and their daughter serving and cleaning tables in a modest but clean space, the fresh baked goods in display cases, the fresh specialty coffees, and the chatter of the \"usuals\" that I imagine frequent weekly if not daily. I, selfishly, don't want this little secret place to get out but I also think they deserve the recognition and success."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem, located inside an unassuming strip mall.  Best coffee in town, no joke.  The coffee is not bitter tasting like so many of the other coffee shops in the area.  The coffee is always great, everyday.    It's great to support a quality family owned business.  The owners are so friendly and always extremely accommodating.    I normally go for breakfast, which is always great.  If I go for lunch I get the Greek salad with chicken which is always fresh.    You definitely have to try Noci cafe, you won't be disappointed.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We Yelped to find a breakfast place in the area and came up with Noci Cafe. It's located in a strip mall. It's small but we found a two top. The server was excellent. The coffee wasn't strong enough so she made another with an extra shots! I ordered an egg sandwich with a side of their potatoes. The flavor was there but it was not cooked enough. Some potatoes were still firm. My spouse also ordered in an egg dish with hashbrowns or actually very thin crispy shoestring fries. He did not like that style of hashbrowns. He only got one sourdough toast which could've used an extra minute in the toaster. What was odd is that we had to ask for butter for the toast. Overall, we'll give it a try again...only because they had a showcase full of pastries that I need to try."}
{"text":"This place was great with cute atmosphere. Came her for a quick lunch.  I ordered the potato soup and bacon caprese sandwich. To die for. The perfect amount of bacon crunch with a blend of melted mozzarella cheese, basil and tomato. Owners were great and very accommodating. We will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice place, the wait at batter and pancakes was way to long so we decided to check it out the food is nice the portions are kind of small but the price is great a mamma and papa place the food is good and nicely seasoned and the food is fresh I got the hash browns it was basically string fries deep fried so not what I expected when I placed my order and was asked \" potato or hash browns \"   But it was good it looked to us like a local hangout almost everyone knew the owner and his wife. Very friendly atmosphere the food is good but not amazing, the best thing we tried was the pistachio muffin. I didn't give it five stars because it was not what we expected and the portions are small."}
{"text":"Like a home away from home. What more can I say. Great food, lovely people and a gathering place for friends. We're there every day."}
{"text":"Love the food , Best eggs Benedict I've ever had in my life and I've eaten in many restaurants the owner is friendly and the wait staff  are exceptional ! You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We came here on a Tuesday during lunch time and ordered the veggie omelette and the veggie burger; both were very good. Highly recommend !!!!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast at this delightful cafe. All of the food was delicious. I highly recommend it for breakfast & lunch. The French Toast was soooo good!"}
{"text":"We eat here two or three times a month. Always with extended family. Why? Eating at Noci feels like family. Noci Café is the very definition of a small local restaurant that deserves, no, has earned, my support.   I was motivated to write this review after seeing two one star reviews pop up today. Seemed odd. Two first-time Noci Cafe diners eating at the restaurant apparently at the same time as me. Complaining Noci is not the same as Butters. Thank goodness it's not! Complaining that the hash browns (the best I've ever eaten) are like shoestring fries. Are you kidding? Stating service was \"not professional, but OK\". You were likely being served by one of the owners! \"The worst breakfast place we've ever been to\". Seriously? One hundred Yelp reviews averaging five stars (until these two showed up) must be all wrong. The only complaint we've ever had in the many times we've eaten here was a couple of dry pancakes. Makes you wonder about the motivation of these two reviewers.   Enough about the stupid reviews. Why eat at the Noci Cafe? I love the muffins. I love the omelettes. I love the hash browns. I love the fruit placed on the pancakes and waffles. I love the oatmeal. I love the kids menu. I love that there is no one hour wait like Butters. I especially love the service and the intimate family atmosphere.   Hoping this review pops Noci Cafe's Yelp average back to five and wishing the two negative reviewers many happy breakfasts at Butters."}
{"text":"The spinach omelets were just okay.  The owner is Albanian and the wife is Mexican.  The omelets were laying on some marinara sauce which was good. The shoestring hash browns were an unusual touch and home made.  The jelly is always home made with several varieties of berries, i.e. kiwi, pineapple etc.  It was not too sweet, made just right.  The home made pastries were about gone so we did not buy or try any of them. However, we did purchase a loaf of Baguette bread to take home and it was also okay.  The service was good, the staff is very friendly.  The Cappuccino & Mocha coffee was very good!"}
{"text":"A spectacular delight! Family run and owned and just wonderful. Coffee, homemade jam and lovely omelets with beautiful presentation. Wonderful service. Lovely homemade pastries"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for breakfast  and coffee! They make delicious coffee and I love the presentation. The food is excellent, I had the Florentine Omelette and my friend had the Chic-Potle, also the chocolate croissant is to die for!! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious omelettes (be sure to check the specials board!), sourdough toast and homemade jam. Unique shoestring hash browns. A perfect breakfast. A nearby table sang \"happy birthday\" to a staffer. Clearly this cute restaurant attracts repeat customers."}
{"text":"Love this new place!!! You have to try the home made soups...(Meat ball soup.. wow to die.) Really great service by husband and wife. I found the best place to have breakfast again and again... Best part, 5 min from my house!!!!! Waffles and French Toast comes with fresh Fruit on top A+"}
{"text":"i went to Noci Cafe for the first time a few days ago and they held up to the reputation! I ordered a buffalo chicken panini and a greek salad with chicken and everything was so delicious. I also have to mention how great the staff was! Everyone was so kind and patient. The prices are also extremely reasonable for such great food. I will for sure be coming back to Noci Cafe very soon and quite frequently!"}
{"text":"When i think of Noci Cafe first thing that comes to mind is outstanding service with a homie feel (maybe because the entire family works here). The owner his wife and the kids are absolute charmers they make you feel at home (a home where all the cooking is done for me haha) Its so hard to know what dish to talk about at first because when it comes to this place everything is made to perfection. The Florentine omelette is to die for. The meatball soup was outstanding, and if you find yourself in the cafe it would be a sin if you don't try the homemade fruit jelly (all the flavors) its unbelievable, so unique and delicious and you will most likely crave it every day! Needless to say i will be here everyday enjoying all the delicious foods they have to offer.  (Ps. Forgot to mention 2 other must try's such as the veggie panini and the fries)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  I had a ham, egg and cheese croissant with hash browns and coffee. Truly a family owned business."}
{"text":"The shoe sting hash browns and the jelly (both hand/home-made) are worth it. Let alone the warm and friendly service. Be sure to check the specials board as some of the best food gems are not on the regular menu.  I had the \"king\" omelette with a side of pancakes... The tortilla chips and salsa on the side was a nice touch."}
{"text":"What a great start to a Sunday! Walked to Noci Cafe this morning with my daughter and we brought the dog, too. Found a perfect spot on the patio and enjoyed a create-your-own omelette, hash browns and an iced mocha. Very friendly staff. Family/dog friendly atmosphere. Nice to have a local family-run go-to spot right in the neighborhood! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is great. Great service, great food, great value. Went there both days I was in Scottsdale. Had French toast and an omelette. Must try! Plus it must be good lots of cops getting coffee here."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast and had excellent service and very good food. Pro tip: try the homemade jam. It's fantastic. We'll be back...often."}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast we experienced in Scottsdale.  It is a small family owned joint with great home made food. Furthermore,  the owners provide great service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The owners take care of everyone that comes in and special requests are no problem. Everything is fresh made down to the best homemade jam I've ever had. I've been holding morning meetings here for weeks and everyone I take here comes back multiple times a week. Finally a mom and pop breakfast coffee place in the neighborhood that knows how to do it. Could not recommend Noci more."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! My husband and I found this place last Wednesday and tried it out for breakfast.  We each ordered a Mocha (DELICIOUS!) I ordered a custom omelette and my husband ordered Sausage egg and cheese croissant.  Everything was wonderful.  From the immediate greeting when we walked in the door to the fast service and excellent food.  We decided to come again today! It is nice to see an authentic family run cafe in this area.  This will be our new go to for our morning breakfast dates!"}
{"text":"Had two eggs scrambled, ham, home fries and wheat toast for breakfast.  They offered me homemade jelly, which is amazing.  Overall, the food was delicious, service was nicely timed and they were really kind.  I will definitely be back here for breakfast."}
{"text":"A delicious breakfast.  A family run business, they do everything to satisfy.  Good coffee, reasonable prices, a great find.  Baked goods are terrific.  Can't wait to try lunch soon."}
{"text":"I eat here every day and have never had a bad meal in fact they have all been delicious because everything is made from fresh natural foods.  Plus great prices!"}
{"text":"Omg! 1st coming to Noci Café, What a great experience !!!!! Love this place!!!!! Coming back for sure Beni and his wife are great people..."}
{"text":"Went here with several friends and it was great. The morning special was recommended by the waitress and it was phenomenal.  Would recommend this place to anyone and everyone. You will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I tried the veggie burger. It was really fresh and delicious. The service is fast and friendly. I definitely be going back."}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast!  The food and service was outstanding and very reasonably priced. I loved being able to enjoy breakfast and then taking danish / eclairs home for later in the day.  Definitely look forward to returning soon!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, fresh food and very friendly staff. It's always a pleasurable and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"My cousin and I found this place via Yelp, and gave it a try. Waking in at first was not what I was expecting, very small cafe with no booths, and seated ourselves. Ordered a omelet and breakfast croissant... Omg so good! The omelet had the perfect amount of toppings and THE HASH BROWNS were thin & crispy to perfection! The croissant was buttery and delicious. This place was owed by a married couple who cooked all the food fresh themselves and you can tell they LOVE FOOD! So good we had to grab a few things from the display to go, of which the apple Danish was my favorite. My cousin loved the homemade jelly so much with her meal, she got a jar to go. This place is worth the wait!! I just hope I can get a table again next time!"}
{"text":"Sweet little family-owned cafe. Had coffee, eggs, home fries and omelette. Was great. Certainly will be back next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little unobtrusive place in a strip mall. The staff was helpful and friendly. They have indoor and plenty of patio seating. We had strawberry-banana crepes, which were divine. We also ordered a side of bacon the slices were thick and crunchy. Excellent coffee! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to have a late lunch and kill some time after getting my hair done nearby. Decided to try Noci Cafe after seeing the reviews here. Very good chicken spinach panini. Very fresh even at 2:00. Will go back."}
{"text":"Loved the Florentine omelette. Fresh ingredients were delicious. The blueberry pancakes with granola was fab as well! Service staff was sweet and owners are involved and care about customers ."}
{"text":"As a Coffe consumer and guru I stop once at every Coffe house but in,vow this atmosphere nice clean great food AND Coffe but most importantly Michi loves it here too so of course we keep coming back now I find out everything is made fresh I house so the tiramisu will be my next visit ;) thank you for great service food and atmosphere   TK"}
{"text":"I'm really confused where these great reviews are coming from. Maybe because of the service?? They were very friendly and attentive but the food is pretty bad, with the exception of the fries. Any place that uses American style cheeses and iceberg lettuce really isn't very good. Maybe I'd come back for a pastry or something but never for an actual meal."}
{"text":"Good value, friendly staff. My omelette was so so, but a guy at the next table was eating a breakfast burrito and that looked good."}
{"text":"The service is fantastic and food EXCELLENT! Highly recommend the Florentine Omelet & the crepes! They make their own preserves from scratch and is delicious! ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Since my name shows Santa Monica, I should start this review by saying that I have a home in Santa Monica and Scottsdale. I've had a home in Scottsdale across from Noci Cafe for about 20 years and although a new family has taken over this lovely little place, I'm happy to find that they are as warm and friendly as the previous owners. It's great that we have a neighborhood place to go that delivers exactly what you want--great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Well I gave Noci another chance. I was with friends that wanted to try it. It was really good this time and everything was served HOT!!! I did emphasize that when ordering and they paid attention. I understand now why so many reviews were so good.    Always give a place a second chance. No one is perfect!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant, by far the best experience I have had, and I dine out a lot. Great food and most importantly, best people to take care of you. If I was to choose a favorite, it would be the steak. And of course , the bakery is something not to miss!  love it here and I hope you will too."}
{"text":"Food here is terrible and the coffee is terribly expensive. We were charged $10 for two small white mugs neither of which received a full refill. Food was flavorless and unappetizing in appearance. Moreover, food options are limited."}
{"text":"Best tuna on french bread! Service was good. Ice tea to go was an added plus! Visiting from MI. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Lovely family owned restaurant -- very friendly staff and family work!  The food is delicious and fresh/homemade; lots of nice sweet treats as well.  Coffee is delicious!  Appears to be a small place that can fill up quickly but was quick service early in the day.  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Our party of five went to Noci for breakfast. Based on earlier reviews, we had a good idea what menu items would be the best choices. While the menu is not extensive, the selections available were absolutely wonderful. We had the waffles with fresh fruit, several egg dishes, great OJ and the fresh oatmeal. All items were cooked to perfection and very reasonably priced.   Both the owner and his wife made sure everything we needed or wanted was brought to our table. This is definitely a family run business and even their young daughter had a hand in suggesting her favorites. Space is limited, but the restaurant is clean and welcoming. A very nice change from the chain options."}
{"text":"had the Florentine omlette, my son the bacon and cheese... He ended up devouring mine:). Soooo good, the shoestring hash browns are ridiculous!!! Best hash browns anywhere! Even the jelly is homemade and amazing. The coffee blows anyplace out of the water! In other words everything that we had was incredible. Best new find!"}
{"text":"This is my second review & again the food is incredible!!!! Also the staff is so warm & friendly, this is a must breakfast cafe!!!!!"}
{"text":"In town for a couple days and looking for a good breakfast place in Scottsdale. This place had pretty solid reviews so off I went for breakfast. Not disappointed. Saturday morning around 10 am. Busy, but not prohibitively so. I had a special omelette, the name of which I cannot recall. It had mozzarella, mushrooms, and was topped with bacon, a cilantro sauce, and pickled jalepenos (optional, for the faint-of-heart, although I will say they were not overly spicy and were quite a worthy addition to the dish). The omelette came with hash browns, which at this place are actually like a cross between hash browns and shoestring fries, and are quite good. Finally, it came with toast. I had the sourdough, with a side of their homemade preserves that were......just....WOW. SO good. I rounded this culinary adventure off with a large cappuccino, which, in keeping with the rest of the meal, was fantastic. All in all a wonderful little hole-in-the-wall breakfast place that I would become a regular of, were I a resident of Arizona. Thanks for the great breakfast and great service, Noci! I will visit again when I'm in town, and I will tell my family that live here in town that they need to visit you. Thanks Yelp, for showing us the great businesses around us! :)"}
{"text":"Best croissant breakfast Iv ever had! Friendly owners and delicious home made jelly. Great food at a great price. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Holy cow!!!! What an amazing place!!! The staff is so nice, friendly, and laid back. But that's not the best part the food is out of this world!!!! I will definitely be back soon and often! What a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place is super cozy, it has the family appeal  all over and that consist of the best customer service, and  home cooked food. I had the Egg and Cheese Crossiant, with a slice of carrot cake. The crossiant was fresh,non fluffy and moist perfect when you make it in house versus having it ordered from a supplier. The Carrot cake was great it had all of the appeal of what needs to be inside carrots, cream cheese icing, and a mixture of seeds. I highly recommend this place if you desire amazing food,service,and a friendly  atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Love this hash browns and home made jam. Good atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I think I have tried most of their menu by now, and I love it. French toast, Huevos Rancheros special, the Beny's Special breakfast sandwich or one of their Paninis are some my favorites with a Cappuccino. Great food and great place."}
{"text":"Want some delicious breakfast?  Of course you do! Noci Cafe hits the spot in a big way.  My wife and I have been there 3 times already, and have loved it each time.  The family that runs Noci is incredibly sweet.   It is a small restaurant.  We've never waited for seats, but it's never been empty either. There have been \"regulars\" there each time we've been in, so clearly the community of McCormick Ranch loves Noci Cafe.    I love their Breakfast Sandwiches.  My wife loves their Eggs and their Fruit.   Everything tastes very fresh.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about going back to Noci, for breakfast or lunch.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly once we walked in the door at Noci. The food was prepared to our liking and was served in a timely manner. Great little place for locals and out of town."}
{"text":"I came here just for coffee but ended up with an almond croissant too. It was perfect, and I like how they don't put any powdered sugar on them. I really liked their coffee too... incredibly smooth and yummy! They have a ton of breakfast and lunch items on their menu. Everyone was very friendly without being annoying.This place was super relaxing. I wish it was closer to home! :)"}
{"text":"fun place..reminded me of being back in Europe. ..food is excellent, the staff is accomodating and we had a great breakfast..We will return."}
{"text":"Very good for Sunday brunch, sat at an outdoor table, friendly and accommodating staff, homemade jelly and unique hash browns."}
{"text":"The best coffee in town! Delicious breads, scones and assorted danishes. They're daily specials are always delicious and full of flavor!"}
{"text":"After looking for a good place to have a regular weekly breakfast on way to work, I found Noci with so many 5-star reviews. I can attest that all the great comments are true. This is a fantastic gem with an owner who treats the customers as good as his attention to the food.  A definite place to try."}
{"text":"Excellent food and super friendly service. Locally owned, small business...go support them! YUM, YUM, YUM!"}
{"text":"Oh my..this place was sooo unimpressive. 1. 3 egg omelette seemed to be missing at least two of those eggs. The feta spinach and veggie with cheese versions led right to the bathroom. 2. Sourdough toast hard and cold 3. Famous Jam - no flavor 4. 2 for 1 coupon was lifesaver to take some sting off $10 entrees. 5. Do not get those stringy, nasty potatoes - who the hell thinks these are any good?      Coffee was kept refilled and service was great and outside seating is a good touch, but nothing can overcome a miserable performance from Chef Boyardeee."}
{"text":"I figured I'd give this place a try and am I glad that I did. The owner was friendly and outgoing and made me feel like I was part of his family. I sat down and was quickly waited on by a warm and knowledgeable  server. The breakfast was outstanding and the coffee made me want more! On the way out, I had to grab a piece of homemade cake that was calling out to me in the display case. It was amazing!!! I had breakfast, but I'll be back for lunch. This place is my new favorite spot to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice family owned joined. You get a wonderful friendly service by all members of the family. Their hash browns are different but in a good way, really enjoyed those crunchy hash browns. My son is a big fan of those chocolate croissant, I was a little disappointed by the waffle which to my taste wasn't cooked enough, I like them  more golden brown and lighter.  I would recommend them in a hard beat, good food, fresh, healthy and a wonderful service! Thank you Noci Cafe."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I came with some friends on Saturday for brunch. I had ordered two eggs, the shoestring style hash browns and toast. My only complaint is the service was very slow. People who came in after us got their food before us and the waitress took a long time to provide us with our bill. At least my friends and I got to catch up while we waited."}
{"text":"This place is great. Good coffee, amazing crepes. They have a special Crepe; strawberry, banana, coconut flakes and we ask for chicken in it. Amazing combination. Sounds strange but you should try it... They also have the breakfast staples, very good food. Staff are attentive and nice to interact with. Rare find."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places.  It was the first time try when we first moved here to Phoenix, the family that owns it is so sweet. And the food is fresh and delicious. A quaint little place with high quality service and food."}
{"text":"stopped by for a coffee and a pastry.  the place looks the part of an Italian coffee bar.  very clean friendly staff.    the restrooms were very clean.  the entire place is well taken care of.  I had a cappachino.  it was amazing.  best in az.  a real cappachino not weak like Starbucks.   it was so good I ordered a second.   cappachino was what you would get at a bar in Italy.  I  also had a cinnamon roll and Apple Danish, both were top notch fresh you can tell it is made in house.  my wife had sausage egg and cheese bagel with potato's.  she really liked it.   best breakfast sandwich in town because of the bagel made in house.  they also have patio seating.  I will come here again and again."}
{"text":"After twice asking if we should order at the counter or at our table we were invited to take a seat outside where they told us they would take our order.  The service seemed a bit rushed and chaotic while we noticed other  patrons growing frustrated as they waited for their check. After waiting in an unreasonable period of time and not seeing a server to take our order we finally left. As we were leaving the one server on the patio thanked us for coming and told us to have a nice day. Very well intended but very out of touch."}
{"text":"Oh my this is a great place.  Today was our first time at Noci as we live in Payson. We have been looking for a good place for breakfast.  Wow did we find it!  First thing we were offered was coffee and I had the cappuccino.  I hadn't  had a cappuccino in ages but this one was terrific.  Menu had lots of options for breakfast, we choose the strawberry waffles and bacon my husband got eggs too!  Everything was wonderful including the fresh fruit on the waffles, home fries, and the home made sourdough toast!  The owner waited on us and his wife came out from the kitchen to check on us and bring more coffee.   They had us try some homemade mixed fruit jelly which was great!  For us the food was outstanding but the service was like being in your best friends kitchen!  Most customers were called by their name and asked about there recents events etc.  We have to come to the valley monthly and will make a point to be here monthly!  Yeah we finally found a great place!  These folks are doing it right!    PS the reviews about service being poor couldn't have been here!"}
{"text":"On our first visit here we were pleased with the food and service.   We wanted to go out for breakfast and this sounded good. It is. The price for omelets and other breakfast items was good.  There was an adequate menu and several specials. I had a sausage omelet. My wife had a special prosciutto omelet. Quality was good on both. Toast was fine: one halved piece with an offer of butter and homemade jam which was fine.  The hash browns seemed more like matchstick fries, the only part of the meal which made me uncertain. There is a short list of coffee drinks but we didn't drink coffee. This cafe stays open for lunch which looked ok. It is a small place.  As we were leaving my wife made an impulse buy of a peanut butter cookie and it was good.  There is a case with a bakery goods selection for takeout.  We had good service and the servers look related, including the young girl who opens the door as you approach.  This is a place to which we will return."}
{"text":"Disorganized, terrible service and the food is very basic. Yet they still managed to mess up the coffee order. Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"The moment you walk in you are treated as family. The staff and owners are the best and make sure you order is correct. The menu is vast and everything is cooked to order. The quality is outstanding and keeps you coming back. The daily baked bread is enough to keep you coming back even if you don't stay to eat!"}
{"text":"The staff here are fabulous. The food not so. The  bacon panini was so greasy That I was using my napkin to dab off the grease. I pulled the bacon off and ate that separate to the sandwich as the grease was to much."}
{"text":"We dropped our furbaby off at the vet and thought that we would have a cup of coffee nearby while waiting. We Yelped the area and found Noci's incredible reviews, so we could not pass it up! Of course, after seeing their delicious pastries and baked goods, we couldn't pass those up either (I wasn't even hungry and was going to lunch in an hour)! Yes, fatty status. Anywho, this family-owned local eatery is definitely worth stopping in. Their service is incredible and the coffee/pastries that we ordered were delightful! I will definitely be back the next time we make a stop at the vet! I will make sure to be hungry and not have lunch plans soon after so that I can try more items off of their menu! Their breakfast looks delish."}
{"text":"Good coffee and pastries very nice family running this neighborhood cafe.Avoid the Breakfast omelets were the thinist little thing I have seen. Maybe there are better breakfast items but party of 6 all our breakfast dish uninspired. Maybe lunch items better but I wouldn't go back unless just for coffee and pastry."}
{"text":"Fantastic neighborhood cafe with clean dining experience and personable service. The food is fantastic! Will be back again"}
{"text":"Noci is an outlier, it's reminiscent of a time long gone. The second you walk in you're greeted with smiles and warmth. It's good... Very good. It's food is as good as it's service, which is as good as it's prices. If you're in the area it's absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. I would eat here again. Belgian waffle and an egg, washed down with some great coffee. Visiting from California."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review after being famished and too lazy to go get my own food, so I used DoorDash to order up breakfast to get the strength to make it through my day. I was a bit indecisive at first, however, you, my fellow Yelpers posted a sufficient amount of photos so I kinda went with what looked good...   I ended up ordering an omelet with veggies and turkey, with hashbrown (so many reviews raved about how awesome they were), and wheat toast, as well as an iced latte with Irish Cream flavor and an extra shot (yea, it's one of those days). Well the order arrived quicker than I expected, which I was stoked about! yay, food!   At first sight, everything looked phenomenal, so I dug in! The omelet was decent, nothing spectacular, but good (could've used some hot sauce though), and the hashbrown... meh. I felt like I was eating tiny shoelace French fries that were overcooked and way too crispy. I mean I like my hashbrowns a BIT crispy, but not each strand to be so crispy -- I wanted to taste the potatoes. I liked the seasoning on them, but I wasn't too much of a fan; won't be getting the hashbrown again... I'll go with the homestyle potatoes next time.   As far as the iced latte... **sigh** disappointed. Maybe I'm not used to their roast of coffee beans? (I may be too much of a coffee snob, lol), but it tastes burnt to me. I keep sipping on it hoping it's gonna get better, but sip after sip I'm disappointed. I can't even taste the Irish Cream flavor in it -- leaves one to wonder, did they forget to add it? Hmm... I hope not, 'cause in that case I just paid extra for nothing.   Overall, my experience wasn't horrendous and I'll definitely try Noci Cafe again. I feel like I didn't get the full experience, being how it was a DoorDash order. Next time I'll go into the restaurant like a normal person and eat there, rather than have it delivered. That way, if something isn't to my liking, hopefully it will get corrected (ie, my iced latte), and everyone will be happy!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty impressed with this little cafe! The service is by far some of the best I've had in the valley: prompt, welcoming, the ladies working are extremely kind and seem to really love what they're doing.  The decor is incredibly cute and makes me want to turn my kitchen into a cozy cafe of my own! Lots of creativity and care obviously went into the design.  I ordered the 2 eggs sunny side up with ham, which also came with hash browns (or home fires but I'm a sucker for hash browns). The eggs were perfectly cooked and the portions of ham and hash browns were definitely not skimpy.  My SO ordered a veggie omelette with sausage which came out looking beautiful. All of the fillings were mixed in with the eggs and folded in a classic French omelette style.  The hash browns were unique as some other yelpers have mentioned, they are very shoe string like and each is crispy instead of leaving the center unfried, but they were still delicious."}
{"text":"Really great food and pastries. Everything is made here on site. Benny the owner is here everyday. That's why this place is doing so well."}
{"text":"Yum! We always just get breakfast to go but it's amazing! Love that it's a small little breakfast spot. A must try!"}
{"text":"Delicious lunch of tuna salad and homemade meatball soup! Great service, super clean and delicious fresh food! Can't wait to go back and try one of the \"Specials\"!"}
{"text":"Met Benni, great guy.  Worth the money. Nice to see the pastries that were there before. Loved the cappuccino, hot and delicious!!!  Now, the bread is fresh and soft, worth every penny! Going to go in for dinner, always thought of that area 'strip mall' as a lunch getaway but, now with the cafe, it is a nice night spot after a bike ride."}
{"text":"We have only eaten breakfast/brunch here but it has always been very good. It is also very reasonably priced. They have a variety of fresh made pastries and full coffee bar. Try the eggs Benedict and breakfast sandwiches. This is our new favorite weekend breakfast joint."}
{"text":"The place had good service, but average food. The potatoes were cold. I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"Exceelent service, very classy small cafe, reasonable prices, fresh healthy and varied breakfast items!"}
{"text":"Frsh, homemade food.   The owner and his wife work hard to make and serve a nice looking and tasting meal. Hubby really liked the hash browns. Homemade jelly on homemade bread -great.   It is more of a  chunky fruit salsa -nicr-  ot too sweet."}
{"text":"Our regular place is Butters down the street. The wait was gonna be an hour today, so we yelped around and found this place.  Service was not professional but ok. The food was just disappointing. The eggs came out cold, waffle was tasteless. They forgot our bacon and we had to ask about it. We could not finish our food although were still hungry. Maybe we had high expectations from the extremely positive yelp reviews. This seems to be the worst breakfast place we've ever been to."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Delicious croissant sandwich! Yummy chocolate croissant too! Very nice family running the place. We will be back."}
{"text":"Since moving from Minneapolis (over a year and a half ago) I have been searching for a fantastic coffee shop that also serves snacks. The coffee had to be amazing, the staff had to be friendly and the food had to blow me away.  Noci is my place!!  We had coffee, a waffle and a pesto and prosciutto panini. It was fantastic!  The waffle came out a beautiful golden brown and include a large helping of fresh fruit. But don't be alarmed it was the nasty stuff like cheap melon. It was fresh berries. The panini came with a massive helping of hearty fries. A perfect blend of euro meets american.   The best part of all was the coffee. We had iced coffee and the ice it was served over rivals sonics iconic ice!  The coffee was brewed to absolute perfection. Bold and flavorful.   The staff was so sweet. It was the owner and his wife who were in there and they took the best care of us. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great place. Feels family owned. The food was great. The home made jelly was fantastic. I had a veggie omelet and they customized it no problem.  My 8 year old son even said \"this place is even better than first watch\" which is his favorite place to eat..."}
{"text":"Both Parm sandwiches (chicken or veal) are great. The paninis are great as well. The owners are so friendly and the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Great coffee and great prices. This will be a frequent stop from now on. They deserve 4 1/2 stars just not quite a 5. Food was prepared fast and presented tastefully."}
{"text":"Noci is a hidden gem in Scottsdale. Family run, and the staff is always very friendly & accomodating.  They bake pastries, muffins, and bread daily, and their food is terrific. My wife & I will definitely become regulars here. I forgot to mention they have GREAT coffee/espresso!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast with the wife. I was lured by the Italian sounding name, however the food was good and service was friendly."}
{"text":"Just popped in for a quick brunch, food was fast and delicious! I ordered the egg ham and cheese sandwich on a croissant and my husband the eggs Benedict. Both were amazing! Servers were friendly and efficient. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! First off the FoH team was composed of a lovely smiling mom, super nice dad  handsome 13 year old brother and Emily,(who's about put me out of a job with her level of hospitality )age 10. All were Super genuine and friendly... & Good at running a restaurant. The basics: came into a packed house with 1 clean table open. Still got service and quickly! My lovely friend Taylor ordered a cappuccino and it was so good, perfect amount of foam ( I tried it, before it was ruined by a sugar Avalanche)... She ordered a fried egg, soft bacon and substituted her side of hash brown for a chocolate chip pancake but the order came out perfect and all hot. I had three wheat blueberry pancakes and a hearty bowl of blueberry strawberry banana oatmeal which was sooo good. The entire meal we were just in awe of the dynamics, you must see for yourself!  And the food was really impressive, even though we ordered simple breakfast items... Don't worry, I'll tell you more about Emily. She walked by us a few times smiling and interacting with other tables just as her older brother was.. And then suddenly came over to fill our recently empty water (ya she's good at her job!) and politely looked me in the eye and inquired if I would like more water... Then turned to my friend and asked the exact same thing but it was so genuine. I'd hire Emily tomorrow, but it turns out her and her brother have it pretty good, as they get to collect on the tips :) Good job! Great success!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here since the first owner left. Came back today and glad I did. The service and food was great. I loved the bread they made in house before and would say it is better now! I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Not for omelette lovers :/  Sorry I hate writing bad reviews... but it was really that disappointing.  The Danish was good (3/5), but I had probably the worst sundried tomato omelette I've ever had in my life - which was unfortunate considering I love them and I walked in starving.  Not sure what the deal was or if it was just an off day, we did come right before closing, so maybe they were more concerned with cleaning up and getting out of there instead of how good the food was, but let's just say if I'm starving I'll eat anything and I left a full plate of food and couldn't even bring myself to try anything else.  So please just read the other reviews before you order and make sure it's something good ... bc clearly they have really good stuff I just apparently didn't order any of it."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here! They serve breakfast, lunch and bake breads, muffins and pastries on premises! Family owned and operated! Great quality food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Stop in regularly, as they are in my neighborhood.  Always a friendly face with excellent food.  Breakfast sandwich listed on the board along with the soup are my favorites.  Love supporting our local, small businesses."}
{"text":"This cafe was great! It's family owned and their staff are extremely friendly and accommodating. He cafe is great for breakfast and lunch. The outside seating is perfect for morning. Would totally recommend for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"An excellent breakfast spot.  Eggs benedict were perfect.  Quiet and cozy ambiance."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything the 4 of us ordered was devoured. The hash browns were awesome...very crispy, much like shoe string fries. The home made jam was a great touch. The pastries were fresh and warm. Service was friendly and prompt. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This little cafe is a neighborhood secret! Consistently great food. You must try the home made jam. Hands down, best coiffe I've ever tasted. Atmosphere is charming. Service is wonderful. Family owned. Food is fresh and high quality."}
{"text":"I really like this spot.  This is an unassuming looking little place in a strip mall that isn't really unassuming at all. They are a step up from traditional diner cooking of the same type of foods.  Breakfast - standard eggs, omelettes, pancakes along with several sandwiches and paninis and salads.  Add in really good baked goods and what more do you need?   Today I had the Chickpoltle Omelette filled with cheese, spinach, chicken and a Chipotle sauce drizzled over the top.  The hash browns are unusual but perfect for those who like their hash brows super crispy.  The fruit is always fresh and tasty. The salads are crisp and fresh. The paninis are cooked well and generally tasty.  The bread is homemade and perfect with the homemade jam.  Overall we have been happy with everything here, so what more can I ask for."}
{"text":"My kind of breakfast spot. Service is prompt and friendly. Pancakes were perfect. Was having a racquet strung around the corner and this was the perfect place to kill the time and enjoy a great breakfast."}
{"text":"The coffee and almond croissant are awesome. Omelettes and crapes are also very good. Great neighborhood morning café"}
{"text":"Very good food, very good Hospitality,this place is awesome.Good cappuccino, wonderful Outlets."}
{"text":"Went down the street first to Butter and there were people spilling out of their windows so we decided to find another place and came upon Noci Cafe.  The owners were great and the food was awesome.  They make a homemade fruit jam that is out of this world.  Great prices for a good breakfast without all of the hassle of feeling like I am trying to get floor tickets at a U2 concert.  We were in and out with no worries and a full and satisfied belly!  Thanks Noci!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic!  Definitely try the hash browns. They are nice and crispy . Yum!!"}
{"text":"Nice, Nice, Nice...  Small, quaint, hidden gem in Scottsdale.  Simple menu. Great food. Great coffee options!  Nice, family run, small business with nice people looking after you with just the right amount of attention :)  I'm coming back with my wife on a sunny Sunday very soon...she will love this place!"}
{"text":"We happened upon this little gem of a café while visiting from out of town.  Best coffee I have had in a long time and pastries were amazing. We have been there for breakfast and lunch; and everything we have ordered has been better than expected. Service was great and owners very friendly. Highly recommend this place if you like great coffee, food and a friendly atmosphere,"}
{"text":"I got charged for a large coffee not the small I ordered and got, I noticed this after reviewing my receipt. I paid $5 for a an egg/hashbrowns and toast...toast wasn't even toasted and the shoe string hashbrowns were very bland/hard tasting and hard to chew...very disappointing for my first visit to Noci Café. Not sure if I'll be back anytime soon.....cute place though, wish I could come back but would only if promised a pleasant experience..."}
{"text":"Good home-style food. The owners are extremely friendly, great people.  Honestly, none of the food blew me away, but it's nice for a casual homecooked feel in a cafe (which also means healthier than many other cafe options).  If you're going to go to a cafe, might as well support a nice, local family business"}
{"text":"If there is a better or more friendly restaurant than this one, I would go there in a wispy moment. The owners work it and they are always so cordial. The food is prepared with care and pride(something I find hard to find in this area any more) .  For breakfast lunch or baked goods, I can't imagine there are many as satisfying."}
{"text":"The last two years we have come to watch the Arabian Horse show we have come here for coffee and breakfast. It's family owned and has a really nice feel. Don't forget to try the pistachio muffins super tasty.."}
{"text":"I love it here - great coffee , great food, great service, great ambiance. This place is a definite hit. A must go regularly coffee shop! I'm so happy I found this place! they have a range of pastries as well as a full menu!! COME COME COME"}
{"text":"Totally agree with the reviews saying this is a cute little hidden gem. Had this bookmarked on yelp due to all of the five star reviews and I am glad I finally checked it out today!  It is smaller than I anticipated and isn't really near anything, just in a random strip mall. But it's a good location! Was not crowded at all and I could tell a few people there were regulars there which was awesome. The people working there were welcoming. Had a good neighborhood coffee shop type feel. I decided on the veggie omelet without cheese and a side of the potatoes and rye toast. It also came with homemade jam! My boyfriend got an egg sandwich with bacon and cheese with hash browns on the side. My omelette was good, and there was the perfect amount of veggies in it! The toast was good, jam wasn't really my thing but I thought it was cool it was made there. I just don't like jam much in general. Potatoes were pretty good. My boyfriend pretty much inhaled his food and finished way before me which is rare! He loved the sandwich and hash browns. I actually tried his hash browns and liked them more than my potatoes surprisingly! Best part? It was super reasonable! Definitely one of the more affordable breakfasts him and I have had together! We were pleased and look forward to coming back to this cute place!"}
{"text":"Small and family owned. Fresh food. Great homemade pesto. These people really try. They close at 2 pm"}
{"text":"Went in today and was promptly greeted by a very friendly staff (family).Potato soup was not what I expected, but was outstanding, lentil soup was also very good but not as good as potato. Burgers and fries were good. Took a Danish to go which was tasty and a loaf of bread to go with my dinner tonight. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Looking for an amazing espresso plus a good sandwich...all added with a nice and cozy atmosphere?! Look no more!! Noci is the place!! Nice family-owned place that offers a well made espresso. Anyone can make this place \"the stop for good coffee place\" any time!"}
{"text":"Five star service and five star food!  I have a few Yelpers I like to follow when they publish their reviews as when they say good, it means really good. This place was one of them. Took me a month before I had a chance to visit here for breakfast but I am so glad I finally did.  When I came with my friend on chilly Sunday morning, we took the last table available. Although they have nice tables outside too but it was too cold to sit outside on that particular morning. Within a few minutes, a nice couple walked in and they were told 10 mins wait. Since we took a table big enough for four, I suggested to them to share a table with us. It turned out they were regulars here and eat breakfast almost everyday!  Per a regular customer recommendation, I ordered egg Benedict. Porched eggs and hollandaise sauce were prepared just right, no wonder why this regular customer calls this the best!  I got to taste a bit of their homemade jam. Right amount of sweetness and somehow they kept the fresh taste of fruit, I thought I could just eat this jam and toast only and be happy.  Cappuccino was excellent too. I enjoyed thick layers of milk foam as well as very good espresso.  In fact I thought it would be nice to come back here to use as a cafe to enjoy coffee and sweets someday.  They also serve lunch.  I would love to come back for lunch too. I have so much more nice things to say about them. It's a small family owned cafe/restaurant and they take pride in what they do. Can't wait to come back for more good food soon."}
{"text":"Noci is a nice neighborhood cafe.  As you walk in they have pastries at a counter to the right and you can grab one and a coffee to go.  I decided to sit at a table inside and have a full breakfast.  The place was pretty busy.  Definitely quite a few old guys who are regulars sitting around drinking coffee and BSing with each other which is cool.  The owners and staff really hustle and provide good service.  I had the sausage and cheese omelet with hash browns.  The omelet itself was pretty basic but good sized.  The hash browns were a little dry and crispy more like matchstick potatoes and I wasn't wild about them.  Overall I'd say this is a pretty good place for breakfast if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast and lunch and both experiences were great. This was one of our favorite spots in the Scottsdale area while vacationing.  I've enjoyed:  Breakfast Croissant Sandwich w/ sausage and cheese: tasty and perfect croissant Chicken Salad Sandwich: yummy crispy fries on the side and served on a perfect french baguette Cappuccino: Yum! Perfect!  The service is always good. Keep in mind this place is tiny and in a strip mall so there is no ambiance. Just good simple food."}
{"text":"OK. this is a restaurant that I could give 20 stars to. It is refreshing to get away from the chain restaurants and enjoy a meal at a family run restaurant. They are open 7am to 3PM and close at 2PM on Sunday. The food is delicious. They serve breakfast all day. The omelets come with hash browns or roasted potato and homemade bread and spectacular homemade jam. YUM!!! The  soup are homemade, try the meatball soup..the best. The chicken salad sandwich is on their homemade crusty bread. All the lads are generous and wonderful. The omelet with potato and toast is only $10. The coffee are well worth the trip. This is the best place hands down in the area. If they were open for dinner, I would never have to cook again. Kudos to the owners. Thank-You for your hard work."}
{"text":"FINALLY - great espresso AND it's affordable!!! Having been born and raised in Seattle, my \"good coffee is life\" mentality has ensured I seek out the best. I've tried all the local coffee places in a 10 mile radius (and of course the Starbucks chain) and this is bar-none the best. Robust but not burnt, a hint of tang but not sour, just the right amount of water for that perfect flavor balance. If you love great espresso you MUST support this local gem - definitely my go-to now! FYI: I got an iced double espresso (Americano) for $2.   They have a great selection of breakfast and lunch items - also reasonably priced - and delicious looking baked goodies too."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches 1st time and had the chicken cutlet and ziti 2nd trip. Both stellar like home in Boston's north end were Benny learned his skills. Oh yea had a homemade cannoli to awesome  Don't miss this place closes  at 4 during week and 3 on weekend."}
{"text":"Wonderful cafe! It was clean and healthy food  Great service too! Everything is homemade  Love the pistachio muffin and blueberry scone Also had fresh yogurt with fruit and oatmeal  Both were delicious  Would highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Quality is higher than that of a dinner. The eggs and hash are perfect and not greasy at all. The owners make their own homemade jelly. Cookies and muffins are very good too. The experience was great !"}
{"text":"The service was awful, only 1 person working and he seemed to be the owner. Very unfriendly, nobody greeted us. Would not go back at all. totally disappointing based on all the good reviews!"}
{"text":"I ordered the antipasto salad and it was fantastic.  This cafe does a great job using fresh deli meat with fresh olives."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch this afternoon. A few people were enjoying the nice weather on the patio with their pups, and the staff brought out a container of water for them. I ordered a cappuccino and a Poppy Salad with chicken. First of all, the cappuccino was exquisite - one of the absolute best I've ever had! The flavors of the salad, combining the crisp sweetness of the blackberries and mango with the savory, steaming-hot chicken, was fantastic. The staff were great too - they checked in with me multiple times and were very attentive. Wish I could have spent more time here, but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came to try this place because of the yelp reviews.  They were indeed on the spot. Great little find and loved the croissant breakfast with Mocha coffee"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong!  Had some of the best espresso I've had in a long time.  The egg whites omelet with spinach and jalapeño's hit the spot!  Most of the time egg white omelets can tend to be flat and rubbery, but this one was made perfectly, light and fluffy.  Excellent, quaint, non-chain/non-corporate run.  The owner makes your coffee and breakfast from scratch right there.  Was a very pleasant morning breakfast and would encourage anyone to give it a try."}
{"text":"After reading all of the great reviews we finally gave this place a try. The service was great - fast and friendly. The coffee, omelette, jam and hash browns were yummy. The pancakes were okay. Overall a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Nice benedict, home fries. French Toast traditional and good, nothing crazy.   Proscuitto, mozz and pesto panini with tomato delicious.  Baked goods, bread looks nice.   Extra points for having almond milk, had an almond milk cappuccino!  Delicious.  Small place, cozy maybe not good for little kids. We'll see when we bring our kids! Lol..."}
{"text":"First off, I think the iced vanilla latte with almond milk was one of the best I've tried in awhile!! Hubby really liked it too- he ordered a large while dining and one on his way to work (that coffee addict).  The service we received was great - they were sweet and friendly. The restaurant was clean and modern. I ordered one scrambled egg and bacon with hash browns and wheat toast. The hash browns were seasoned and tasted good. I couldn't stop eating them - the problem was I having a hard time eating them with my fork since their like thin matchstick fries so I said f it and started eating with my hands. They gave me homemade jelly that was delicious! Hubby ordered the Beni's special and he ate it all!! I guess he liked the food too.  Overall, our bill was inexpensive compared to other breakfast spots that we've been to. Yelp, you were spot on - this place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We went to Noci around 10:30 am on a Saturday for brunch and surprisingly there was no wait! It's a cute little cafe in an unassuming strip mall. The Noci menu online looks a little boring, but they have so many creative specials posted on a black board in the cafe! We ordered the avocado toast and and the Mediterranean omelet, which were both specials. They did not skimp on the avocado toast! It has lots of avocado on it and also some feta, heirloom cherry tomatoes and an egg. The Mediterranean omelette came with a really tasty pesto on top of it. The only reason why Noci wasn't a 5 stars is because the coffee was weak. Otherwise it was a perfect breakfast! I want to come back to try a crêpe!"}
{"text":"Love this Café! Great atmosphere, perfect location. Great place to meet friends! Love their Cappuccino and the steak and cheese subs are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Excellent 1st time visit. The jam is delish. Prices reasonable and friendly staff. I will come back next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great place- always try the special, plenty if healthy options and the owners and staff appear to be family and they treat you accordingly."}
{"text":"Great food, extremely friendly staff and just an exceptional experience overall. Highly recommend this place for both breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled across this gem this morning.  Great atmosphere, and the food was fresh and delicious.  My wife loved her Croissant breakfast sandwich and the French toast was covered in fresh fruit and super delicious.  We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great little family run cafe. Friendly service. Food is superb. I'm never disappointed when I come here. Try the home made jam."}
{"text":"When we asked Siri (on our iPhone) for the best breakfast while visiting Scottsdale, AZ, she told us Noci Cafe. It's small but a charming wonderful cafe. They make their own bread, and desserts. Their breakfast was great and we could have ordered one of their special omelets but wanted something simple.   The whole family was there helping serve coffee, taking orders & welcoming return local customers. They were all very friendly!  If in the area, stop by for coffee & a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place, great environment and great food. Kind of a hidden place but will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic cafe. As many others have said, this place feels like its straight out of Europe. They play very cool European music & the atmosphere is great. The food is also great. I have gotten breakfast here & lunch paninis & its always great quality food. Feels like home made & the family that runs this place are very nice. Definitely stop by."}
{"text":"A quaint little restaurant with great service and great food. Highly Recommended!  I was in the area around lunch time and checked Yelp, hoping to find a nearby gem. Based on the stellar reviews, I gave Noci's a try and was not disappointed! I arrived just after noon on a Friday, and it wasn't at all crowded. Most of the other customers seemed to be regulars judging by the friendly conversations with the staff. If I lived nearby, I think I would become a regular at Noci, too!  Food: The menu is packed with interesting choices. Breakfast and lunch are both served all day. But be sure to check out the board up on the wall behind the counter for the specials. Between the menu and the specials, I had a hard time deciding what to order! I settled on one of the omelette specials: the Chic-potle, and it was a good choice. The omelette has chicken, spinach, sundries tomato, Monterey Jack cheese, and a mild chipotle sauce drizzled on top. Honestly, I could have gone for more \"kick\", the chipotle sauce tasted like subtly spiced mayo. But even so, it blended well with the other ingredients for a nice flavor. The omelette comes with a choice of hash browns or home fries, but I asked about low-carb options. I was offered a fruit cup (not exactly low-carb!) and it came with a good variety of fresh fruits. I also had sourdough bread with homemade jam. The sourdough was tasty, and the jam was mixed-berry, which had a good flavor and a chunky texture reminiscent of cranberry relish. All-in-all, I really liked the food.  Cost: My lunch with no drinks, including tax, was a very reasonable $10.80.  Service:  The owner and namesake, Ben Noci, and the staff were very friendly and attentive. Service was quick, and they checked back occasionally to make sure I was happy.  Atmosphere: Well, it's a fairly small shop in a strip mall, but once inside it has a nice feel to it. Noci's has comfortable chairs, attractive wooden tables, and a tile floor, which all combine for a subtle, classy look. Tables are also available outside, if the weather is agreeable.  Overall: Highly recommended! Based on this one visit, I will definitely return when I'm in the area. Noci's menu has so much to offer, I'm eager to try more things."}
{"text":"Came here based on the high reviews and left thinking this place either used to be really good and went downhill or manipulated their Yelp rating with fake reviews because when comparing this place to others in the general area, it doesn't make sense to ever come here.  I ordered an iced latte and huevos rancheros with hash browns. The latte was almost undrinkable - it tasted like cold drop coffee mixed with milk.  The highlight was the huevos rancheros which were actually pretty good - hence two stars in this review. However, I asked for hash browns as a side and what I received were thinly cut french fries that were subpar at best. I asked about a possible mistake on getting fries and the server mentioned that these french fries were, indeed, their \"hash browns\"...  I think the people running this place should probably check out google images on what exactly hash browns are or change their side choices from large French fries (the other option) to \"small French fries\".  Overall, a disappointment - especially when Butters, Altitude Coffee, and Village coffee are literally right down the street."}
{"text":"Wow!! My new favorite breakfast joint!!  Coffee....stellar! We had a regular drip and decaf cafe au lait. Perfect.  For breakfast we had the bacon and cheese omelette with hash browns and toast. I've never had an omelette with bacon where the bacon was so good. Lots of it in big pieces and it was still crunchy! Homemade berry jelly was a lovely touch with the toast.  It was so good we had to try a muffin, and that too was delicious.  Great food, coffee and vibe (even the music) and fast internet to boot.....wouldn't change a thing!"}
{"text":"We had omelettes with hash browns and toast.  Yummy homemade jam.  Friendly service.  A neighborhood place with indoor / outdoor seating and an eye popping display case of sweets.  SW corner of Hayden & Mountainview is convenient.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great menu and SUPER service, even on a busy Saturday morning. Loved breakfast and friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Wow! Been here many times and the service and food are a true first class experience! A nice mom and pop restaurant that's all too rare today. Their kids wait tables on the weekends.  I love the breakfast croissants and the hash browns are so airy and light ...the owner tells me he cuts them by hand into these strips! Labor intensive but wow what a unique texture.   Love this place, let's spread the word!"}
{"text":"I like intimate and charming, so I found this café to be the perfect setting for me. The atmosphere is warm and friendly because the place is run by a charming family who all pitch in to cook and serve. My favorite item by far is the cappuccino. I am a snob when it comes to coffee, and I can guarantee their cappuccinos are the very best. Second for me is the French toast. They serve it as you like it--for me that's with fruit and a sprinkling of powered sugar. All in all, your best bet is to forgo the big chains with the prefab food and step into a welcoming place that serves fresh food with a personal touch. And yes, after one visit, everybody will know your name."}
{"text":"The bacon came late and not crispy as ordered, and the hash browns are actually crispy shoestring fries. But the waitstaff are very friendly and eager to serve, so it feels like they're really trying, but haven't quite figured out how to do breakfast. There's a lot of potential here, but they have some work to do."}
{"text":"Great service for breakfast.  In and out in a timely fashion.   The egg dish I had was delicious however I was disappointed with the home potatoes...  bland and uneventful...."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and attentive, nice outdoor seating available. They also have a small bakery and additional options off of the menu. Food was hot and tasted fresh, their hash browns are uniquely made but if there's one thing you need to try it's their homemade jelly. Prices were reasonable, seems like they're family owned. I would come back here any time. They just need to start serving mimosas..."}
{"text":"My first time ..... Excellent ! Staff is very sweet and food was great!  I am a picky vegan.  I ordered the quinoa veggie burger with no mayo and no cheese, and added pickles!  I was not disappointed!  I will return !!!"}
{"text":"Simple delicious, fantastic service and food. The pistachio cup cake was out of this world! If you decide not go there, you are missing out of great food. The Greek omelette I had was fantastic. The portions are  perfect."}
{"text":"This cafe was cozy and the staff were inviting. We tried the banana/strawberry crepes with dulce de leche sauce, pancakes with fruit, bacon eggs and breakfast potatoes. They make homemade preserves which was my favorite part of the meal. Overall, the meal was ok; nothing spectacular and with a tip our meal was $50. I don't think I'll won't be going back but I like trying new restaurants that are out there to switch it up."}
{"text":"So happy that I found The Noci Cafe, food was amazing, I had Chicken Parm over Pasta and my husband had Pepper steak and cheese Sub and came with a really nice salad we love it."}
{"text":"What a great little spot for a quick breakfast! We stopped I'm after a hike this morning and were greeted so kindly. This place has the mom and pop feel and you can tell they really care about the quality of food they serve. They truly enjoy it. We ordered off the specials of the day menu. A mediteranean omlette and juevos rancheros. Both were so good, I can't say which was better. I can say the best treat was a pineapple and raisin crossaint. Please don't pass this up. It's so good we ordered a second one before we left! Definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"BEST cappuccino I have ever had in my life(and I make a great one)...Food is AWESOME...owner operated...the food is homemade -made with LOVE. Homemade jelly is outstanding...omelettes and shoe string potatoes are to die for. Don't miss this GEM!!"}
{"text":"Love this little place. Best vanilla latte + amazing food + a very sweet family who runs the place = I wish I could put more stars!"}
{"text":"Lovely family owned restaurant- the whole family was there providing amazing service  Breakfast was great and reasonably priced  Bakery items were very good"}
{"text":"Disclaimer* I'm not the owner or the owners friend. I originally stopped by the burrito express and noticed they weren't open yet but this place was. I ordered the egg, bacon and cheese breakfast croissant. I was surprised when I was asked if I wanted hashbrowns or potatoes as it is a side that comes with the sandwich. The hashbrowns are like non other that I have ever eaten and very tasty. Service was great and very welcoming."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in a long time! Amazing family owned little cafe with all that is wonderful about \"mom and pop\" places. Great coffee, I had breakfast sandwich with actually hot eggs and crisp bacon on a fresh baked yummy croissant. This is the neighborhood kind of place to make me happy to be in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great little family operated breakfast and lunch spot. The food is great, and the atmosphere is even better!"}
{"text":"Noci Cafe offers friendly service and good breakfasts for a reasonable price. It was pretty busy when I got here around 10:30 but the crowd eased up as I finished my meal. There is seating both inside and outside, and there is a counter with bar seating as well as a case of pastries for quickie to-go orders.  After browsing through the breakfast menu I went with the veggie cheese omelette with home fries and multigrain toast. It was made in record time and a very generous amount of food.   The omelette was super fluffy and soft, mixed in with a lot of chopped peppers, onions, and spinach. It could have used a touch more seasoning but overall I enjoyed it. The potatoes were soft and were too mealy tasting for me. Some more browning to crisp up the edges would help with the texture in general. The house-made jam served with the toast was actually my favorite part of the meal. It was lightly sweet and oh so fabulous. I scooped up as much as I could onto my toast. I could eat a vat of that stuff!  Service was super friendly and they really want to make sure you are having a good experience here.  I'll definitely be back to try more items off the menu if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Place is a cozy cafe with awesome homemade food. This place is family owned and service is great. I had the omelette with hash browns and homemade jelly w toast. It was awesome. I will make this place part of my regular restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Had brunch with a friend here and this place was small but everything was great. The avocado toast is amazing and I would come here again whenever I'm in the area. Ps. Coffee is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Food was DELICIOUS, and the family that runs the place could not have been nicer! The whole family helped out, and you could tell how much pride they take in their business. Coffees were great and authentic, and they had tons of homemade items that were awesome."}
{"text":"Noci has a coupon in the entertainment book.  We arrived about noon and it was pretty empty.  It is a very small place only seats about 20 people inside.  We ordered some eggs and toast.  I had the salad with fresh berries, mango, spinach it was very good.  The jelly came out with the toast, so we ordered some muffins so we could all try the homemade jelly.  This is where it got weird.  I ask the owners if all the muffins were home made and both her and her husband said yes, her husband said he made all the muffins from scratch himself...My friend who works at Costco was with me and we both looked at the Poppy and Chocolate muffins which so happen to look identical to the muffins at Costco.  I say this because I can not eat the muffins at Costco because of some of the ingredients.  But for a restaurant to pass off store bought muffins as their own, is pretty dishonest and can be harmful especially if you do not know the ingredients.....The muffins which looked homemade raisin bran and pistachio tasted great and we all finished the jelly.  I had to only give them 3 stars because of the misinformation with the muffins..  The food and the prices were great and we might try this place again and try the sandwiches but will stay away from the poppy and chocolate muffins."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Friendly, neighborhood cafe with incredible food and service.  Family owned and operated, they make you feel at home.  Must try!"}
{"text":"Noci Cafe used to be Galileo Bread, right?  I loved Galileo Bread, but promise to be fair when inevitably comparing Noci Cafe to Galileo.  I stopped into Noci Cafe for the first time, glad to see someone in Galileo's old space.  Both the server and a gentleman who I believe to be the owner worked harder than I have ever seen to make sure they were giving excellent customer service.  They both were so nice to me and all the customers, gladly and pleasantly answered all questions and did everything they could to try to meet the Customers' needs before we even knew we needed it.  I ordered at the counter and the server even came around the counter to take my very small order to my table, after asking me what table I want.  They way exceeded my expectations, which I realized have been set by too much time in Starbucks lately.  The coffee was very good and prices aren't bad, especially for the area.  Unfortunately, the croissants weren't very good.  They weren't flaky, were too soft, didn't have a crispy outside.  Not nearly as good as the perfect croissants Galileo used to make, and I was disappointed because we don't have any good bakeries around here and I was hoping we had one again.  If it were just for the pastries this would be a 2 Star review. However, it could just be learning curve and I hope the pastries will improve in time.  The people at Noci Cafe made my day, and I encourage you to stop by for the excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Cute breakfast place. Staff/owners very attentive and concerned about my soy allergies. Offered to special order my breakfast.  I would definitely come back.  Yummy avocado toast!!"}
{"text":"I eat breakfast here every Friday morning. They have fantastic food and the BEST coffee!  5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Finding a good place to eat lunch on a Sunday is always challenging but I found this cafe on Yelp rated 5star so it caught my interest. This is the only business open on a Sunday in this shopping center so it was pretty easy to find the cafe.   Walking in I was a little confused cause no one really said anything so we just found a table and hoped for the best. It's a small little cafe with a good ten table inside and a few table outside. Very modern looking with a mirror wall next to the tables. Interesting. All their specials are on the huge chalkboard.   The waitress came pretty quickly with the menu and took our drink orders. I started off with an iced latte. Which was really good. I ordered the three egg omelette with sausage and cheese with potatoes and sour dough toast. I wasn't expecting too much cause it's just an omelette but man was that good. Loved the sausage. Very flavorful and really enjoyed it. First time I could really say I was impressed with an omelette. It came with some shoestring potatoes which were really crisp and flavorful. They were pretty good but the toast. Really Doug. The toast. It came with their homemade jelly. Cherry jelly. Do I have to say anymore. I love cherry. It was so good. Chunks of cherries. It was so good. I finished the toast but just ate the rest of the jelly plain. It was that good.   My wife ordered spaghetti and meatballs. Wow. The meatballs were just the right size. Juicy. Tender. Really really good. My wife keep asking me to try the spaghetti but I declined but she kept on pushing it so I took a little Twirl and it was so good. I loved the marinara sauce. Never had a sauce like this. It was so good. My wife said that she could eat this every day. I would have to agree with her. It was outstanding. Her meal came with a side salad with Italian dressing. Really good dressing. Usually Italian always has a little too much vinegar for me but not this one. Perfect spices. Really enjoyed the salad.   So the service was outstanding. It took a little while for the kitchen to bring our food out but that's okay. This is a mom and pop shop and I love to support these places. The mom is the waitress. Dad is at the counter and their son (8th grade) is there to help clean tables and deliver food to the tables. Very cool family. Very friendly. Always kept tabs on us. Really enjoyed our meal. Outstanding.   At the end, we ordered a cherry turnover to go and I got home and couldn't stand it and had to eat it. As you know I love cherries. It was so flaky. So good. Then I got to the cherry filling. So my gosh. Better than the cherry jelly. Yum yum good. Gosh darn it was so good.   So what's not to like about this place. Good food. Good coffee. Good service. Mom and pop shop and such a warm and friendly atmosphere. I've got to come back again and try more of their food. I'm hooked. Loved it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite little hidden gems to go to when I want to escape the noise, hustle and bustle of the popular bk joints. It is unassuming and quant. Noci is located in a strip mall but don't let that fool you. Food is always delicious. I typically go for the eggs, bacon, toast and shoestring hash browns. I have tried omelettes  and french toast. Everything I have tried has been really good. I go for the French fries (yummmyy yum) when I get the breakfast bagel sandwich. I always end my meal with a cup of decaf. coffee.  Indoor and outdoor seating(misters too) is avail. Service is wonderful and so warm. Celine and Ben are amazing!   Local, family owned, great food and great service. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Small seating space however the food was incredibly fresh and tasted amazing. (Had two egg breakfast with sausage links)"}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast with a cute friendly environment. Perfect brunch atmosphere. A small quaint place to sit and enjoy some coffee and great conversation. Loved the omelettes, pastries, and the friendly service. They made you feel like a regular and when you're visiting a city, that's a great thing to find."}
{"text":"We had lunch & the good was fantastic! Everything was homemade. We had the meatball soup and it was the best we've ever had. Highly recommend that everyone try this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast at this little European style cafe!! Was in a rush and the female server was amazing!! She was so accommodating and got us a full meal in less than 30 minutes with hot warm delicious food!! Started with expresso and British breakfast tea!! Both clean and tasty!! Had the florentine omelette which had a very nice taste especially with the fresh Mariana sauce...really good!! The hash brown is a must!! It is so crispy and delicious!! Literally made perfectly!! Also got the chocolate chip pan cake which was super soft!! Excellent place!!"}
{"text":"I do not understand why this place got such good reviews. Every part of my meal had a problem. My omelet was burnt, the toast was so dry it snapped in two and fell apart, coffee was weak yet tasted burnt, and the hash browns were a loose pile of overly cooked shoestring potatoes. I was not sure if I should use my fork or hand to attempt to eat the hash browns.  On a positive note The staff were very nice and attentive. The restaurant was clean and had nice patio seating."}
{"text":"Good food, quaint spot. Menu was a little small, but service was great and it was a nice little cafe."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend and I'm extremely grateful.  All of the breakfast and lunch dishes I've tried were delicious and very reasonably priced.  I believe it's family owned and the staff is always super friendly.    $5 breakfast sandwiches come with a side of hashbrowns and they have a huge bowl of fresh fruit for $5.  Also keep an eye out for their specials.  Basically everything here is good"}
{"text":"Amazing, from out of town looking for a reasonable price place to eat. The Sonora omelette was amazing. The homemade jelly and the the hash browns were to die for 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"A wonderful neighborhood delight..owners are warm and friendly..everything we have eaten was delicious. A wonderful addition for mcCormick Ranch."}
{"text":"Excellent food,  friendly warm atmosphere, exceptional customer service.  A new neighborhood favorite"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place! Very affordable, great service! The brew coffee taste delicious and all the dishes are big size, highly recommended! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"It does not get any better.  Great food  and great service.  What a nice family.  My wife got an omelette and I got the blueberry waffles, both fantastic, perfect ...but  the best part was the fresh fruit jam served with the omelette and (afterwards we bought a couple of criossants......delish!  Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little cafe. Nice Vibe!  Really good food. Thoughtful and considerate service. Homemade jelly! AND delicious pain au chocolate (croissants with chocolate in them) which we enjoyed in Paris this past fall. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"New owners as of a month ago. Today I had the chicken parm and spaghetti plate. The chicken was sliced and mixed into a bowl of spaghetti (no plate?). Unfortunately the spaghetti was pre-cooked and mushy with no flavor. I spoke to the new owners about it and they said they will fix the mushy spaghetti issue. I sure hope so."}
{"text":"There are a few very simple reasons this cozy cafe is rated 5 stars.  The owner and his wife are amazing, so friendly and accommodating.  The food is great, and at a fair price.  The menu has all the classics and their specials are creative and delicious.  My wife and I went twice on our honeymoon, by the second visit they had us feeling like regular locals.  Breakfast here was one of our highlights of our stay in Scottsdale.  I'd go back a thousand times!"}
{"text":"Good hot breakfast, neighborhood feel, owner Beni running the show with pride! My first time here, but I dig the atmosphere and food was great. It felt good to bring business to a place in Scottsdale where they actually seem to care that you are there!"}
{"text":"Wow what a cute little place! The family that runs this business is super sweet. It's very special to see an entire family working together.  We went here for the first time for breakfast this morning and were very pleased. I had the eggs Benedict and it was cooked perfectly. The hash browns are tasty too. (Like little matchstick fries) We also shared a chocolate croissant and it was delicious! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Nice little cafe. Good food and coffee. Love the patio seating. We were greeted very warmly and served immediately. Everything came out hot and delicious. Then we were forgotten. We sat and talked for over an hour and not once did any one come and ask if we wanted another beverage or a refill on water. And even twice a waitress with a water pitcher walked by our table and didn't acknowledge us at all. More stars had the customer service been better."}
{"text":"Our new  favorite spot for breakfast and lunch. Great food, friendly service...What my more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Some reviews are just pleasurable to write. Noci Café is a small family run restaurant/bakery/coffee shop that is simply exceptional. A perfect spot for brunch.  Noci is small. Perhaps eight tables indoors and a similar number outside. There can be a problem finding a table at peak times or if a large group shows up, but most hours it's not an issue, especially if you don't have a preference whether you sit indoors or out. The outdoor seating is shaded and on the north side of the building, making it quite comfortable most of the year or just requiring a sweater if it's the cool season.  The menu features breakfast and lunch items, served all day. Additional menu items are posted on a chalk board behind the counter. Noci is open from 7:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m. weekdays and 7:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m. on weekends. You may just stop in for a coffee or bakery item to go if you'd like. On this early afternoon visit, our party opted for breakfast, lunch and baked goods. And why not? All were exceptional. The panini? Great! The burger? Great? The breakfast platter? Great! The muffin? Great! You get the idea. If there is a weakness in the menu, we have yet to find it. One of our young ones didn't care for the fruit and granola yogurt concoction she ordered from the kids menu. The yogurt was too tart for her young taste buds. Our waitress/wife/co-owner noticed the predicament and suggested adding honey. Problem solved. Not a speck left in the bowl. Even lowly potatoes, hash browns and French fries, were amazing. When have you ever eaten hash browns as a finger food? We did today at Noci.  The family vibe of the establishment makes dining at Noci a true pleasure. Service is always friendly and accommodating. Midway through this meal our soon to be seven year old floated the idea of having her birthday party at Noci. Don't think we'll do that, out of respect to the owners and other diners, but we will definitely be back to enjoy Noci again and again."}
{"text":"Great little family owned cafe! Excellent service and food is excellent. I totally recommend to visit"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!   The staff is extremely friendly and I can tell by just visiting a couple times, that they are extremely loyal and kind to their returning customers.   Would definitely recommend.  The breakfast sandwich is super yummy!!!"}
{"text":"First time in yesterday morning.  Grossly overpriced, tiny spot.  2 scrambled egg whites for $6.00  Toast consists of 1 piece cut in half. Coffee $3.00  No non dairy flavored creamers  No turkey sausage or turkey bacon.  Service was good!!'    Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little stop to meet my best friend for lunch. We got quick service and tasty food. I would definitely eat here again soon."}
{"text":"You can build your own omelette. My go to is bacon, cheese, sausage and fresh spinach served with country potatoes. The kicker is the home baked multi grain toast with their own fruit jam. Great service and nice outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Great family friendly restaurant.  All the servers were excellent and the special order food was cooked right the first time.  Great family spot to stop and enjoy brunch."}
{"text":"The breakfast was very good.  They have a pretty extensive menu, and the prices were reasonable.  Our waitress was excellent.  She was very attentive and made sure everything was to our satisfaction.  I will definitely return there."}
{"text":"Very good. Order the eggs Benedict. Cappuccino was fantastic. You will love the hash browns. Service was so friendly and perfectly attentive."}
{"text":"It was OK at best. I am sure it was wonderful with the original owners, but it was not really worth it. The best I can say is the service was friendly. The food was just OK. Sorry."}
{"text":"I had one of the best cappuccino at Noci Cafe, I also tried the chicken panini its was perfectly toasted and so flavorful, enjoyed with a side salad. Service is awesome! Super friendly owners and employees, I highly recommend Noci Cafe."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast in a quaint little coffee shop! The service was warm and welcoming, and the food was fresh and delicious. We will return when we come back to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Tasty food...if you don't mind waiting an hour to get it. They have a tiny kitchen so just be prepared to wait...and wait...and wait. We went on Sunday at 11 am & the food came out painfully slow. It was all very good, though.   I ordered a Florentine omelet with cheese, spinach & tomato sauce...but it was also inexplicably served with ham & avocado. I didn't mind because I love those things but I'm sure a vegetarian would have been none too pleased. I got the fruit instead of toast since they don't offer any gluten-free. The fruit was delicious & fresh, unlike a lot of fruit cups you'll find full of mushy, dying melon & grapes.  My daughter loved her avocado toast. This item is not on the plastic menus they hand out. We only knew to order it from seeing it on Yelp. There were a few other menu items we didn't notice until after we ordered - they're written on the chalkboard inside & we were seated outside.   From reading other reviews, it looks like there is a new owner. It seems they're still figuring out how to run a restaurant. I'd say I'll come back for the good food, but I probably won't unless I have lots of time to burn."}
{"text":"Noci certainly lived up to the hype we saw on Yelp. The owners and their family run the place and they know how to provide great service. We found out they have just been in business about a year but with the high quality of food, reasonable prices and the excellent service, they should be in business a really long time. They bake their own breads and pastry there. The baguette that came with my wife's omelette was fantastic. Their \"jelly\" is homemade and is more like a compote or chutney. According to the owner, his wife makes it and they just mix a variety of fruits together, depending on what they have on hand."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and we're looking for a new family brunch spot so we're trying a few places in the area. We brought our two little girls (5yrs and 18mo) and we all liked Noci. The seasonal muffins are great and the staff is very attentive. The food came out as ordered and expected, and we also got an iced cappuccino and mocha to go which were very classic and rich. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and food to die for!! Quaint little place with excellent homestyle food and baked goods!"}
{"text":"I am always trying to find new places to eat, and when I do, I usually leave the restaurant saying to myself ... \"I would have rather eaten at home\" ... THIS DID NOT HAPPEN AFTER EATING AT NOCI CAFE!  Quaint, yummy breads, homemade jams, blueberry pancakes with real blueberries oozing out of them, omelets filled with every fresh vegetable imaginable ... it does not get better than this.  I hesitate sending this review, in fear that they will become so popular, I won't be able to find a table ... but they deserve even more than 5 stars.  This is family run by charming people, using every moment to please their customers!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place - I looked at the menu online and looked like I would enjoy most things - it is also close to my work.   Alas, I didn't even get to try the food.    I was greeted when I walked in.  I was handed a menu and told to pick my own seat and that they would be right over.   (this was at 12:45, some tables were occupied, but mostly not busy)   I waited for 10 minutes and no one approached - it was like I was invisible.  They went around to other tables.  I tried to make eye contact and got nothing.  So, I left.  Not even a good bye or wait sorry.   I love to support local, but I can't support you if you ignore me."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The breakfast is great and the pastries are amazing. I've tried a couple different croissants and had the breakfast sandwich twice. The lattes are wonderful too!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and this is such a cute place. Small, family run business that seems to take great pride in their food and service.   Great coffee and the breakfast was fresh and yummy - especially the hash browns, which were finely shredded and crispy.   The only reason I'm rating 4 not 5 stars is because their pastries are a little more soft and doughy than I like. I prefer my croissants more buttery crisp on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside...you know, the kind that has a slight crunch when you bite in, but then almost melts in your mouth.   Love supporting small business so I'll definitely return! I was impressed with their service and breakfast so I'm interested in giving their muffins and lunch items a try too."}
{"text":"Ordered the 2 egg breakfast with bacon and the Sausage and Cheese Omelette with shoe string potatoes and Sourdough Bread.   Homemade preserve was fresh and good made with Raspberry, Cherry, Peaches, Blueberry and Pineapples.  Nice little restaurant tucked in a shopping plaza that locals know about.  There were 3 people serving the entire restaurant that included as many tables outside than there were inside so they were on the go the entire time.   I would like to go back and try more dishes and had a great experience."}
{"text":"Was drawn to Noci by the excellent reviews. After going, I see why. Had a short wait and they kept updating us on progress and were apologetic for our wait which was only 10-15 minutes. Food great and service excellent. You can tell it is family run. We will be back"}
{"text":"Wow! Selfishly I hesitate reviewing this place...so close to my house...3 minute wait to be seated on a Sunday morning.  It's a legit ma and pa place....nothing fancy....located in a strip mall...seating capacity for around 30 probs.  Two VERY polite young girls running the floor...didn't say much....just efficiently went about their work. But DUUUUUUUUUUDE.....Huevos Rancheros was the BOMB! Just like a perfect breakfast should be...not necessarily reinventing the wheel...not a kaleidoscope of flavors...just a simple, perfect combination of complimentary ingredients.  Only been once, so can't speak of the ENTIRE menu, but honestly, I don't know if they sprinkled crack or powdered unicorn hoof in my meal, but I want some more...I need some more."}
