{"text":"Cheese and pepperoni ok. Sauce was excellent, cheese ok not good or horrible. Crust ok. Had 2 wall of fame pizza. Potato and flame thrower both horrible. \"Homemade\" cola products out of fountain really good. 

Sauce -excellent 
Cheese- so/so
Crust- ok

Not crazy expensive, ok value"}
{"text":"We were the only two people in the restaurant when we ordered. The girl who made our pizzas got one of them wrong which wasn't realized until it was brought to our table because the wrong item was added after being baked. Rather than complain, we ate our meal. The manager came by a short while later and asked how everything was. We informed him of the error and he did offer to make a new pizza. We declined as half of the wrong one was already eaten. He was apologetic and very friendly. I appreciate his offer to correct the other employees mistake but seriously...she had one job and we were the only two customers!! That's only a 50% success rate! I'd hate to see what happens when they're actually busy. The quality of food itself was good; no complaints there but I just don't see is frequenting this place after our first impression."}
{"text":"Love their pizzas  My favorite has to be the cowboy bbq pizza!! Such a great atmosphere!! Beer and Pizza thumbs up"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great pizza for an awesome price and they always have top notch service. Looking forward to grabbing a pie in about 10 minutes"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place! Everything I've had has been amazing! Anything with the Spicy Cilantro Lime sauce is the bomb! Sgt. Peppers is my favorite. They have local craft beer and all natural sodas!"}
{"text":"I was a first timer and they deserve more than 5 stars! Excellent customer service!!!! Good environment, clean, unique soda selections and delicious pizza!! Definitely recommend them and will be back more!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! $9 for an 11inch pizza with unlimited toppings, perfect to split with a pizza dessert on the side. Great atmosphere, good quality toppings, and friendly staff. Went here three times the week we discovered it. They also have a rewards program which is great! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Always quick and fresh! Staff is friendly! Very relaxed atmosphere. The pizza is great besto pesto is really good the cowboy had to much bbq sauce for me.."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, great tasting pizza, beer and soda with real cane sugar.  You can also get salads. and the price is great.  No extra cost for toppings!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Service was awesome, fresh ingredients, all organic.  Family environment!"}
{"text":"Good concept Horrible execution. I don't think anybody that has posted about this place has any idea what pizza is supposed to be!!!!!!! They do use nice ingredients and that's about all that's good about the food. You walk up to order your pizza pick your toppings and they put it on a piece of dough that is half dried out. Take a look around while ordering it's like your in a hospital cafeteria there is not even a pizza oven in the place it's put into an oven that has a conveyer belt and pops out the other side just like the easy bake oven my 4 year old has at home. Pizza is about fire and stone. Like I said ingredients were good, crust was not, not at all!! There is no pizza feel to the place at all . I hate to bash a place but this place needs to rethink there approach to pizza . Employees are very nice but very slow."}
{"text":"I kept seeing this place when I would drive by and always wanted to try it. I would hear how yummy it was so I decided to get it delivered through grub hub. It was very fast and everything was exactly how I ordered it. I got the loaded potato skin pizza, and sgt. peppers pizza. The crust was thin which I liked, and everything was fresh and amazing. I also ordered a side salad with a bunch of toppings, and they didn't miss one topping. I would definitely recommend this place. Good job guys! Thank you!"}
{"text":"We tried Eklectic Pie for the first time today. It's a fairly new place & I really didn't realize it was a Pizza Place until I received a coupon in the mail. Finally went in, the place was much larger than I expected, nice atmosphere, friendly & helpful employees and best of all, food was great. Price was reasonable too, We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time.  The service is is GREAT!  You can tell that the employees really like working here.  So friendly and helpful.  As compared to other like pizza joints (e.g. think Subway of pizza) this one is definitely the best.  Fresh ingredients, great price, crust is good--a little thin for my taste but next time I will get the double crust for just a buck more. Oh, and the beer and wine choice... awesome.  They have local craft beers in cans and on tap for a little over $4 ($3 during HH) and top rated local wines for a little over $5 (also $3 for HH).  Just go, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"First time in - tried their gluten-free crust margarita pizza and loved it! I will definitely be back again to try more!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were here recently and really enjoyed it! The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was great! The pizza was delicious  and my husband commented that he especially liked the pizza sauce. I tried the Orange Blossom wheat beer and my husband tried the birch beer (which is non-alcoholic and similar to root beer), and we both loved our choices! We will definitely be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's like the subway of pizzas as you pay one price and can heap toppings to your hearts delight and all for only nine bucks! I'm not sure how these guys stay in business so just out of guilt I always end up buying drinks or a side (the wings and skins are fantastic!). They offer craft sodas and an eclectic beer menu that changes from week to week. Tip: Get on their mailing list and use their rewards program and you will get all kinds of deals sent your way. Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Usually the pizza is really good and the service is amazing, bought 4 pizzas, one was supposed to have a finisher on it, got home and looked at my pizza and realized it wasn't on it. My wife and daughter had a pizza each with the chopped chicken and they both got sick."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and drink selection is the real winner here. The endless toppings are also a cool way to personalize your pizza pie. The pizza is ok, but depending on your taste, there are better pizzas out there. The staff was friendly and over the top excited to help out. 

Overall I would recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came across a project pie in Vegas and fell in love with the concept, so when we saw this opened up right down the street from the house we were all over it.

The owner was holding the door to greet customers which was very nice customer service he explained the concept him and his wife decided to implement into the restaurant and thanked us for coming. All the employees were very nice and the inside was decorated perfectly. Since it is new there was a lot of people and limited seating (understanable). I am a plain pizza person so I only get pepperoni and my fiance gets meat lovers, he enjoyed his pizza although for myself it came out soggy and floppy. I also noticed there was no corn mean on the dough.... To me that's what makes a pizza, also they use ovens like dominos or pizza hut would use instead of a fire oven or brick oven which changes the taste completely. It was good but I would drive further to another place with the same concept next time. 

It's a shame becuase I wanted to really like this place."}
{"text":"Found our new date night place! Love the vintage/modern look. Very friendly staff and great food! Not expensive at all! Try it out you will love it! We got the 11\" Cowboy BBQ & 11\" Flame Thrower. Very good size personal pizzas and very filling! Then we got the cookie smasher *WARNING NO ICE CREAM ON THE COOKIE * BUT!! It was still amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. I love that they don't charge for each topping, it's all one price.  That's such a great policy.  The guys making the pizzas were obviously loving their jobs, so I'm guessing they treat their people well.

Taste was great, nice thin crust, everything tested fresh.  Highly recommend trying it.  I wish they had one in east mesa."}
{"text":"If mod pizza married in-n-out burger and had a son, and a local craft brewery got together with mom-and-pop's corner store and had a daughter, then those two kids hooked up, I think their offspring would look a lot like Eklectic Pie.  

The concept is fast personal pizza with your choice of a zillion items, or somebody else's choices from the wall of fame.  What makes it awesome is the caliber of connectedness and service.  The beer and soda selection is icing on the cake, all enjoyed with creative and welcoming (and a touch curious) decor and music. 

A definite must-visit."}
{"text":"I called on Weds before Thxgiving to place an order and was told I needed to order online only.  I created a profile and tried to order and I kept getting an \"unavailable \" error online.  I waited 10 minutes again and still received the error.  I called back to inform them of their online issues and he said he would reboot his online server.  I asked if i could just  place a telephone order but was quickly dismissed.  The guy said...\"I'm busy making a pizza and don't have time to take a phone order.\"   Really??? Too busy to sell a pizza???

Not a good first impression here"}
{"text":"All five in my party tried a different pizza and we loved them all!! Getting ready to order some dessert which I'm sure will be just as good.."}
{"text":"This pizza is so bomb, I love the thin crust and there sauce.. The Italian and the cowboy bqq are really good .. I go crispy 1&1/2 times thru oven for that bomb crisp. All the pizza flavored are good and you can customize it the way you want . The 7 inch is perfect for on person ..."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, great fresh ingredients.  No heat lamps or microwaves!  Cane sodas and top notch customer service.  We WILL be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza joint around!!!! Sorry, no joke, the rest of the pizza joints around here should just close up. No one can touch the amazing pies at Eklectic Pie!!!!! Every time my wife and I go there, everyone is happy and smiling. Don't forget to order a soda, because the root beer is by far the best around!!! Take out, eat in, it doesn't matter. Fantastic ingredients, friendly service, the making for a perfect business plan!!!"}
{"text":"I was impressed.  I usually only go to fired pie of mod Pizza, but this place is just as, if not better than those places. If your a soda drinker they use all natural sugar rather than the high fructose corn srp which taste better than regular soda"}
{"text":"I love this place. An entree salad is $8 and comes with whatever you want: Italian sausage, pepperoni, sliced mozzarella, blue cheese crumbles, parmesan, cheddar, carmelized onions, mushrooms, red peppers, chopped tomatoes, raw red onions, black & green olives, artichokes and more!

You can have any of that on a pizza; or choose one of their unique specialties.  Garlic parmesan knots with a side of marinara is $3. Good. $2 domestics during weekday lunch.

Relaxed atmosphere.

They serve Boylan's brand sodas, and some iced teas. On the plus side, they have birch beer (kind of like root beer)."}
{"text":"No complaints here. The service, prices, atmosphere and food are phenomenal. We ordered two create your own pizzas and two desserts (see photos for descriptions). Choice of 7 or 11 inch pizzas with a max price of $7.99. Add any toppings and combinations, which is great if you are a newbie or indecisive. You can even do half and half with very different flavors and toppings. 

We actually just tried Fired Pie a few weeks ago and loved the concept. We like the topping variety better at Eklectic and as a heads up, the desserts are much bigger here and could easily shared. We ordered two and brought home leftovers. The chocolate chip was like a flat, half-cooked cookie and the apple was like a pizza crust with apple topping and crumble. The choco chip had more taste to it but the crumbles on the apple version were yummy. 

We signed up for the loyalty program while there (on your phone via their website) and you are immediately eligible for a free dessert. Just give them the name on the loyalty account. We will definitely be back. Fresh ingredients and great options. We will do without the desserts next time (they were good, not great)."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here. I love loading my pizza with veggie toppings. Always comes out delicious. You can't beat the price for the kid's meal, which includes a drink with the 7 in cheese pizza. Makes it a great place to eat with the family. 
We have ordered the cookie pizza before too. Not totally crazy about that. A hit with the kids, but nothing special. 
Love the soda offerings!! Not your usual soda choices. If you're a cream soda fan, you will not be disappointed!!! Absolutely delicious. 
I really appreciate the GF pizza option as I have a family member with Celiac disease. They are very accommodating when you tell them about dietary restrictions. 
Service can be a little slow. If it weren't for that, I would give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"\"Yes hello, i would like a cheese pizza with everything you have to eat in this building put on the pizza as a topping for no extra charge\"

that's how this place works. And they have brews....see ya"}
{"text":"I'm happy to give this place five stars.  It's not fancy, but it is fresh, fast, great employees and consistently so.  We've eaten there 3 times, and really look forward to it.  I'm always looking for healthy choices, and I'm really happy to find this place."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is a refreshing/new way to order pizza. I have eaten there several times now and every time its been a thumbs up. Its priced perfectly. I would recommend this unique spot to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in awhile. Make your own. Tons of toppings and no extra charge no matter what you put on your pizza."}
{"text":"We love coming here for lunch! Everyone is super friendly and the pizza is delicious!  We look forward to the fresh ingredients and consistent great pizza every time!"}
{"text":"Ordered online--menu stated a meatball sandwich came with a Caesers salad--uh no!
When I picked it up, I asked the employee about it and she said \"oh, I think they changed
that\", I said no they have not changed it in the computer to which her response was \"oh\".
Not that impressed with the pizza.  I ordered 4 toppings and they were barely there, a lot of
empty space between toppings. The pizza did not look anything like the photos provided on yelp.    Since I ordered online and it was my first order, I received
a free dessert and I chose s'mores pie--I'm just glad I didn't pay for it because it tastes 
terrible.  Needless to say, I won't be returning--on to the next."}
{"text":"I stopped in a few weeks ago and ordered a half loaded potato skin and a half meaty Italiano minus olives pizza ($7.99), and had a San Tan Oktoberfest ($4.39) to wash it all down.  Right away I was greeted by the employees and I really like the interior.  They did a nice job.  It's funky and interesting.  They have a fantastic selection of local brews and wine to choose from as well, and the pizza combinations on the wall of fame are very creative.  I saw several I want to try.  Of course you can also build your own.

The potato skin pizza had intrigued me when I looked at their menu online, and living up to its name, it does taste like potato skins which goes GREAT with the beer.  The meaty Italiano half was very good as well, with lots of good quality meats.  I just didn't care for the crust.  It's a nice thickness, but totally bland.  I read the other reviews and the owner's comment about why they use the conveyor ovens.  That makes sense.  I just miss some kind of garlicky or buttery or seasoned flavor in the crust if it's not going to have that brick oven flavor and char.  Thankfully the toppings are all excellent and kind of overcompensate for the crust.  I enjoyed my first visit and my husband really enjoyed the leftovers.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Looking at the photos posted by other reivewers I'm thinking maybe we caught them on their off day. We ordered two pizzas, pepperoni and meaty, both 11\" and were underwhelmed. The toppings were scarce, the pizzas tasted too salty, and there was way too much grease. We used a promo code so paid about $13 for two 11\" pizzas which wasn't bad. If I had to pay $19 for them I'd be more disappointed. However, we will not be ordering from them again, there are better pizza places to chose from."}
{"text":"Suuuuper slow. The line was not that long, maybe 4-5 customers ahead of us but we waited in line for almost 30 minutes to order and pay for our food, then another 15 to get our food. The workers looked like they were moving in slow motion. Like, painfully slow. If you've got a movie you're trying to make, plan for at least 45-60 minutes!"}
{"text":"Wow, wasn't expecting such a variety of toppings and sauces that were fresh amd delicious; the sauces were impressive and mighty tasty I had a mix of basil pesto and cilantro jalapeno lime. Woth fresh mozzarella, graded mozzarella, sun dried tomatos, red onions, fesh basil, red peppers, mushrooms and roasted garlic. An amazing pie with fresh ingredients delivered from an amazingly friendly staff."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of Mod pizza.  Unfortunately I have to drive about 15 minutes away to get to it.  This however, is just down the street.

If you're a man...then you get lots of meat.  That's exactly what I said...give me all the meat.  For any of the meat that I love...extra!  The staff was very accommodating and didn't even blink an eye to what I was requesting.  I loved the different ingredients which seem to blow all the other \"custom pizza\" places out of the water (this is our 4th or 5th pizza restaurant).

It is very comparable to MOD including some of the sauces.  I wish, however, that they offered ranch as a side in the end.  If they do (since they offer salads) they didn't make it clear.  

I love the interior of the place.  It's very modern but homey as well.  The atmosphere really did feel like a \"family\" atmosphere.  Families were eating together and the owners (who seemed to be anyways) would mingle and laugh along with everyone.

The dough is okay.  It is a little bit crispier since they don't \"oven bake\" it but rather use one of those pizza conveyer ovens.  MOD pizza would use a fake wood/brick fire stove or whatever but the crust is always soggy since it's never left there in time.

I also appreciated that I don't have to walk to the counter to grab my pizza rather I can just take in the atmosphere and have it brought to the table!

Price:  Very reasonable!

Things to improve:  The staff are a little slow.  There was a couple behind us who was pointing at one of the ladies placing the sauce on top of the pizza.  If I didn't know any better it would be like my 3 year old trying to place the sauce.  She placed it on a tablespoon at a time with the giant ladle.  It's not that she placed too little...she placed a lot...it just took FOREVER.  That's the theme of this whole experience.  Yes they were friendly, filled with energy...MAYBE they are just getting into the groove of things since it is now a 3 week old restaurant but sheesh get some speed in since there's a line!

Bottom line:  We'll return again!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and service! My mom and I happened to be in the area one night and came here for dinner. We have been coming back ever since! This is the only pizza I truly love the crust is awesome and the people behind the counter are so happy and helpful. Love it. We will be back of course!"}
{"text":"Eklectic Pie
The staff are friendly, the atmosphere is fun and the food is good.
We came in before they officially opened and enjoyed two free pies.
You get to choose your own size, 7\" or 11\" and then choose your own toppings.  You can add as many toppings as you want, in any combination to make your pie.  The toppings are fresh, varied and delicious!  Since I got exactly what I wanted, i really enjoyed my pie.
The food came out fast and the staff were attentive.  Since this is close y my house, and a local movie theater, I will be back; and bring friends!"}
{"text":"Ordered three of their pies and good flavor and good crust.  Wish they would let us order over the phone as we tried but they pointed us to creating an on-line account so ended up going in.  Staff was friendly and prices were reasonable...will be back and looking forward to trying out their beverages...both adult and sodas/China Mist teas!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the feel of this place. I have been twice in the last month. The pizzas cook quickly and the service has been great. They have a great lunch special.  Small pizza and side salad for around seven dollars which is plenty to fill up on. I usually get the pepperoni pizza with Caesar salad. Their Caesar salad dressing is one of the best I have had. I have suggested this place to friends and coworkers without hesitation. Give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed. They do have a self serve soda machine but it is not Coca-Cola or Pepsi products. I believe its called Boylan's soda. My friend said its good. I don't drink soda but I think it's cool that they serve something other than the big two soda companies."}
{"text":"So numerous of these types of pizza places are popping up all over the valley.
This will be the 2nd one I've been too.
It's good, it's fun. I'm not blown away by any means. We had a party of 7 come in and ordered 7 different pizza's and sampling one another.  My 11 year old son ate two 7 inch pizzas! 
I'll be back, my kids like it better than the other we've been too. I know these guys have been here awhile, and it sucks for them to see another EXACT replica pizza place going up `100 feet away and a MAJOR chain going in across the parking lot. 
THUMBS UP EKLECTIC PIE!!

We also ordered 2 dessert pizzas that were the bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"There are so many places popping up just like this, Pieology is among my favorite for their plentiful selection toppings. Ekletic Pie is now among my top favorite, the ambiance is unique and comfortable. The topping selection is good with the exception of it missing garlic. The only thing that lost points is the staff is not very friendly, they seem annoyed to be here. The drink area was a little dirty and the menu once you get in, is a bit chaotic to look at. We stated that it was our first time in and were not sure what to get. No suggestions, no information...just a blank stare from the staff. Love that they have a wide variety if food (potato skins, sandwiches,  dessert) and also love the playing cards given to mark your order number. Drinks are okay, teas pepsi, and other cream sodas, rootbeer. You will not find your typical coke or pepsi selection.  Other than that everything is pretty good taste and price wise."}
{"text":"Enjoy their custom pizzas. Very good basil pesto pizza. I added jalapeños and it was perf. Marguerita pizza was a little soggy, too much marinara. I like that they serve wine and craft beers. The inside is cool, lots of interesting places to sit."}
{"text":"This place is laid back and different. Pizza was good and the gluten free crust was well done. Overall you walk through a line and pick your toppings, nice thing is all toppings included in the price of the crust size so, load up! Other than that, they do have draft beer on tap plus a few microbrew selections. Price was about normal for what you would consider... family of 5 (mom, dad 3 kids) about $40 (including the pint of IPA I enjoyed... Life is good you know... enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I am not a pizza person. I went here to get my son something to eat and decided to get my own pizza since I saw they had vegan options. I have to say I was super impressed! I ate the entire 8\" pizza and I never eat that much pizza. The sauce was great and not overly salty or oily (I hate that) and had tons of flavor. I love veggie toppings and they had a ton of veggies in addition to vegan cheese which was great. I also loved that you can get addtional toppings like spinch, basil, vinaigrette, etc when the pizza comes out of the oven. 

Another thing I really appreciated was the employee switched out his gloves before making my pizza so as not to contaminate mine with the cheese/meat from the previous pizza. The staff is super nice and the atmosphere is really cute. I also appreciate the Arizona wines that they carry. So happy to come across this little gem!"}
{"text":"I don't care for their food. I like the idea behind it, but it's flawed.  The toppings are the best part of their menu.  The crust itself is flimsy and tasteless. I didn't care for the sauce either. They are slow"}
{"text":"While I hate the spelling, love this place! First visit, and I'm hooked and can't wait to take the kids. I got the 7\" chicken pesto pie and added garlic, basil and ranch. I was planning on skipping the crust (carbs) but it was super thin and crisp! I didn't even eat it all and spent less than $6! Yes! I'll be back"}
{"text":"Love a real gluten-free option for pizza. baked right in front of ne. They even paid special attention to my 4 year old daughter.  They also had soda that was made with real sugar instead of HFCS. I'm impressed,  going back again. Just wished they delivered."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here a couple weeks ago. We were so impressed by the quality of the customer service, the types of food that was offered and how delicious it all was.  I was amazed to see they even offer dairy free cheese, the daiya brand  (I have a child with a dairy intolerance). When I asked about the cheese, the girl that made my pizza who suffers from Gluten and dairy intolerance made an entire pizza just for my little boy so that I could take it home for him to try. She went above and beyond in making us feel welcome. We also loved the monday night prices-you get a whole pizza for only $5, it might actually be all day I can't remember. Either way, we will definitely be back. Thanks Eklectic Pie!"}
{"text":"We ate here tonight after looking at the reviews. We didn't know what we were really getting into. WOW! The service from everyone here was great. Every employee was helpful and just good people. The product was amazing, we had three pies. 4 beers and a coke for $34. THAT IS AMAZING! You have to come here. Monday pizza nights are now scheduled at Eclectic!"}
{"text":"Dare I say, the best pizza place I have ever been to? 

The best atmosphere! Everyone is so friendly and happy to make suggestions. Fast service. Delicious food. Its like a Chipolte, but for pizza, and without all the salminola or whatever. 

Its just good!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  Looking forward to ordering from here again and trying some different pies.  Great prices too."}
{"text":"So many choices! I ordered the 7\" Wine Country with Alfredo, mozzarella, Gorgonzola, caramelized red onion, walnuts, baby spin inch, and balsamic fig drizzle. It was served quick, hot, and delicious! I also enjoyed a cup of jasmine green tea. All for under $10."}
{"text":"I love this place but the STAPLEY location is closed. Visit their Chandler location.

Quick delicious pizza your way.  This is my second review. I highly recommend this pizza restaurant.

Wine Country Pizza
Alfredo Sauce, mozzarella, gorgonzola, caramelized onion & walnuts topped with baby spinach leaves & balsamic fig vinaigrette.

The cowboy barbeque pizza was delicious. The employees are friendly.

The atmosphere is pleasant. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The workers at Pie Five Pizza Company are so great. I was wondering why the place was empty, but when we got our food I began to understand. The pizza crust is pretty bad and I got balsamic dressing for my salad which is usually oil based, but this balsamic was like syrup. Even with great service I would not go back."}
{"text":"This place is great! The pizzas are always made fresh! Fresh ingredients and great service! And it's always clean! That's a plus plus, cheap and affordable, made fresh every time. The staff is also very informative on what certain ingredients are and how they taste, and they have local brewery beers on hand that are affordable as well. I try to eat here as much as possible! It's a five star in my book!"}
{"text":"Delicious as ever and my daughters new favorite pizza, the Maya Meat Trio.  Acropolis was also delicious and birch beer on fountain is fantastic."}
{"text":"Cool concept! It's like subway but for pizza. It's actually really good. Great if you have a bunch of people who can't decide on pizza toppings. A tad pricey for what you actually get; however, i would definately come back again."}
{"text":"Tasty pizzas with fresh ingredients, friendly service, and craft brews makes this place a trifecta of excellence!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and good service. The soda they have is amazing! I like the Creme soda, personally. Definitely a place I'll be coming to often."}
{"text":"This place has a nice interior and friendly staff. The prices are good and the ingredients fresh. They do not have big brand soda either. Instead it serves Boylan's pure sugar cane soft drinks. I had the lunch special of a 7\" pie and a side ceasar salad. The pie was excellent but could possibly need a little longer in the oven and the salad was great except for a few large lettuce pieces ( I try not to look like a crazy person stuffing in a huge bite when possible lol). But those were such small things that I can give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I went in and ordered a gluten-free pepperoni pizza. It was nice that the person making the pizza change their gloves to make sure there was no gluten on it and made the gluten-free pizza for me.  It was cooked to perfection and ready to eat in about three minutes.   Restaurant was very clean and the food was a good value for the money."}
{"text":"Visited based on a friend's recommendation, E.Pie definitely didn't disappoint! Staff was friendly and efficient...ordered the wine country and pesto chicken pizza. Wine country was the favorite between the two. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for pizza but not the best either.
If you're out walking (like my husband and i were 4.5miles at that point) and you don't want heavy food then a small pizza and a small salad does the job.

I had the Italian white wedding which was good, although they could have cooked it a little longer and my Husband had the gyro, which he thought was good.

Probably not a place I'd go again but its not bad."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! The Flame Thrower is my favorite. Such good flavor. Everyone who works here is amazing too. Can't wait until the new store in Gilbert is open. Thanks for such a fun experience spinning the wheel too."}
{"text":"Eh. The girl that made my pizza was nice enough. But when I asked for a to go piZza and sat down they put it on a metal pizza plate and brought it to my table..... okay so this tells me you couldn't be bothered to listen to me. 
My brother walked up to the table and asked for a to go box and explained the issue. 
They gave him a box too small for the pizza to go in. 
He goes back AGAIN and RE-EXPLAINS what he wants and they finally give him the right box. Disappointed. Wish the staff had bothered to listen. 
 The pizza at least was amazing and hit but they didn't rly have any regular coke or Pepsi products. They opted for strange unheard of cans of beer and \"hip\" drinks like izze. Their soda machine featured strange flavors like cream and ginger. They were good but I wish I didn't feel like I had to try something completely new. 

Poor service , strange drink choices, good pizza. Two stars."}
{"text":"We tried Eklectic pie for the first time this weekend. We were VERY impressed. Delicious pizza's with all the extra toppings you could want. Get the roasted garlic, it's heavenly!!! I got the Potato Skin pizza... OMG it was amazing!!! Hubby and little one both got something different and it was perfect for each of us. We all can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza for a great price. Good specials M-W. Friendly staff. Quick, easy, tasty, and just the right size for everyone to have their own pizza."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time and loved it! Pizza was awesome and so was the staff! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here about a dozen times since they opened. I'll start with the good - the food is undeniably fantastic. It tastes great, hot, and fresh. The price is right and the beer is cold. Dont even get me started on the s'mores pie - it's the best!

However, the speed of service is absolutely abysmal and seems to be getting worse with each passing week. This last trip on Saturday 8/13 around 6pm was the last straw. The place was not busy - there were about 5 people in line ahead of us. We waited in that line for 20-25 minutes. UNREAL wait time. The music system was also off (inexplicably) so we waited in silence, painfully aware of the impatient sighs and chatter of all the guests now waiting in the slow building line behind us. 

The staff has absolutely no hustle. They need to be re-trained to ensure speedy service to guests. The bottleneck at the counter is terrible. Not sure if they need more ovens, more employees, or an espresso machine to get their staff moving, but something has to give. 

3/5 stars until this is addressed."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all! Pizzas are tiny and the salad even tinier. Prices are way to high for the small amount of food received. Won't be returning here!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. The 7inch is the perfect size. I got the besto pesto chicken pizza. Very yummy!"}
{"text":"I came back again. The pizza is so thin and burned... sad face. I did tell him And he was very accommodating. We appreciate it and still love this place."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Build your own and don't brake the bank. To top it all off they have dark beer . Heaven!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The husband and I checked it out after some shopping in the complex. We got the Italian pizza and it was delicious! Loved the sauce and the extra helping of toppings. The crust is really thin and crispy, very good as well. The service staff was very nice and cleaned up our plates when we were done. Also before we left they handed out frisbee's and water bottles that had their logo on it. We will be back for sure! And we are just down the road so very close too!"}
{"text":"Great place, good quality toppings. But if you load up the toppings they will serve the pizza slightly under cooked. Pro tip: ask for extra cook on loaded pies"}
{"text":"First of all, first time there and last time!!
Ordered an 11 inch pizza while is an adult personal pizza, the 7 inch is for kids!
My pizza was tasteful but not enough for the price, cracker crust assembly pizza which they cant cut pizza correcly so trying to take it apart was a mess.
You would have to order 3 pizzas just to get full, not worth the price, its a pizza subway!!!"}
{"text":"Nicely decorated place. I had the chairman chow pizza and it was pretty tastey. My wife had the meat lovers? Pizza.....meh? Ok at best.
The black cherry cola was good.
2 pizzas 2 sodas.....22.00
Please do mistake this for good pizza from your local pizzeria. View it as something else because it does not compare. Interesting dining concept but the end product does not impress. If they only used a dough that is thicker and bubbles up.....maybe."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had heard about Eklectic Pie via Facebook because pizza. And even though we live in downtown Phoenix, we decided to endure the insane 20 min. drive to see what the fuss was all about. We got there an hour before closing time on a Thursday. Things were pretty quiet, which meant no line and faster pizza into my mouth. Everything about this place is really slick. The logo outside is a super bright yellow and eye-catching in the evening. Inside, things are cool, industrial, and unusual. It felt thought-out and meticulous. Once in line, you get the option of 1. choosing your pizza size (7\" or 11\"), 2. picking your sauce and 3. mixing up a variety of awesome ingredients at no extra charge. Shut the front door! No extra charge! A part of me wanted to go nuts, but the other part of me was lazy and really hungry, so we chose to go with 2 different pre-made pies from the \"wall of fame\". The \"Meaty Italiano\" and \"Besto Pesto Chicken\". No dessert this go around, but next time for sure. I don't drink soda, but my boyfriend commented on how the soda was really good and not a corporate brand like Coke or Pepsi, but instead a brand I had never heard of called \"Boylan\". He was a fan.  Anyway, we waited for what felt like about 8 minutes and BAM. Pizza was all up in my grill. Being the meat-lover that I am, I definitely favored the Meaty Italiano. The Besto Pesto Chicken was great too - I think in the future I'd ask for more pesto sauce though. I would've loved to try one of the spicy options, but my boyfriend is a white kid from Vermont. So clearly that'll have to be a solo visit next go-around. All around, the staff was super friendly and made the ordering process very clear and easy. Prices are affordable, pizzas were crisp and fresh. If you live in Mesa or want to hang out with the new pizza kid on the block, go check out Eklectic Pie!"}
{"text":"We came in from a busy morning of running errands and figured we'd give Eklectic Pie a chance. We order two pizza but played it safe on this visit being the reviews are mixed. The service is nice, inside decor is cute. As far as the pizza goes, the sauce is a bit sweet for my tastes and the crust is very thin. As far as toppings go, they are endless. Our next visit I/we won't be as safe. If you have a family that has mixed taste buds when it comes to pizza this for sure would be good for y'all. Affordable, not bad tasting and fast service. 
It's not easy to find so my suggestion would be to have more signs leading you to the \"right\" pizza place. After awhile they'll be 3 pizza places in the shopping center. My only other thing would be is, on a slow day or time, the music should be played a little lower being your almost yelling at the service worker."}
{"text":"Good pizza made quickly, without skimping on quality.  You can have a mountain of toppings, all for the same price.  Great selection of Boylan sodas!  Fast service!"}
{"text":"IF YOU WANT TO ORDER FROM GRUBHUB, BEWARE!!! This location will not start your order until the driver is there, even if he or she calls ahead and let's them know they're on the way. 

Additionally, if the driver is already there for another GrubHub customer, and your order happens to come in while he or she is waiting, they will refuse to give your order to the driver, opting instead to have someone else dispatched to get your food.

The result for you is a needless delay of 30-60 more minutes in getting your food!

My suggestion is save yourself the delay in getting your dinner, and order from another pizza place that uses GrubHub. Sal's Gilbert Pizza is an excellent choice!"}
{"text":"So I have been to many build your own pizza places and this one disappointed me. I am a vegetarian so I love places where I can make my own food. I felt like the different sauces were not visible unless you looked at the menu around the corner.  I asked the girl that was going to put toppings on the pizza to change her gloves and I thought her jaw hit the floor. She just finished stocking pepperoni and I don't want that in my food. (This is not the first time I have asked this at a pizza place and most people don't care) The pizza is super thin. I like thin pizza a lot but this one is so thin it bends and toppings fall off when you try and pick up a slice. The sauce is super sweet. Wish it was better."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town! You get to design your own or choose from favorites - mine is the Sgt. Pepper. The real sugar rootbeer or birch beer is Ah-mazing! And while you're there,  try the dessert pizzas. Oh, and super affordable!"}
{"text":"The employees here are friendly and very out going. The whole place is inviting. The toppings on my margarita pizza were delicious, but the pizza itself was undercooked. Made a very disappointing end to a good first impression."}
{"text":"My family and I have absolutely loved this place since it opened a few months ago. Their staff is always unbelievably friendly, the ingredients are fresh and delicious, and the atmosphere is really nice. We've tried a handful of \"build your own\" pizza places and this one by far surpasses its competition. Their local cane sugar sodas are also a really nice surprise. We also appreciate the occasional coupons in the mail, and at least once a month they have a great value special. We will be returning and recommending often."}
{"text":"Tried out a new place.  Kids are picky and they loved it.  We tried different pizzas and the pizza nubs.  Good, nothing brand new to the industry but very good pizza and we will be back.  A great step up from your hole in the wall pizza joint."}
{"text":"They have a gluten free crust for the pizza and it's the best crust I've ever had!!! Usually it all tastes like cardboard and I love that you can put whatever you want on them for no extra charge! Definitely coming here from now on anytime I crave pizza!"}
{"text":"It was very good. Service was fast. Good had excellent flavor.

I had gone here the other day to use my Birthday loyalty reward. Couldn't ask for any other place for a free pizza for your birthday.

Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Visiting Mesa today and I happened upon Eklectic because of Yelp! THANK YOU Yelp! Seriously, one of the best pizza experiences I've ever had! The crust was light and airy, the toppings were superb, the pure cane sodas were on point.... And to top it off, the customer service was incredible! The only thing I wish for after this experience??? That they open on in  San Diego where I live! I can't wait for my next trip to Mesa so I can come back!!! Well done Eklectic!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, the pizza was really good.  However, the service was not as good. They just seemed really unmotivated and kept having to take pizza back as they forgot to cut the pizza. They could definitely use some customer service training."}
{"text":"Super fast Super cheap and Super good!  Definitely a great choice if you're looking for that quick service personal pizza... and the Beer options are great too!!"}
{"text":"I ordered online and got confirmation that it would be ready at 5:50pm. I showed up at 5:50pm and went to the carry out counter. The staff didn't acknowledge me. 10 minutes pass and I still haven't been acknowledged. The line was getting long and people were becoming impatient. At 6:15 (25 minutes after I arrived) a man behind me in line spoke up and said that he had been waiting awhile. They quickly gave him his to-go pizzas. What?! I STILL had not been acknowledged at this point and I'm going on 30 minutes waiting in the store. I had ordered online an HOUR prior. So now I'm upset and considering just leaving but I had prepaid for my pizzas. A second man in line behind me received his carry out order and left.  A staff member finally asked what the name on my order was and I told them. They couldn't find it. After looking for a few minutes, my order was found in the warming oven. So...I paid full price for cold, cardboard-like pizza after waiting nearly 40 minutes. Come on! Totally unacceptable. The staff member just said, \"Sorry, we don't have a good system\". Once I got home, I had further realized that they did not even include the right sauce on my pizza. I'm baffled right now."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for the first time and we were thoroughly impressed. We walked in and noticed what a cool environment there was right away. Then we were immediately met at the front by (I believe) the manager and he welcomed us. Then he caught us by surprise when he went through the menu and how ordering went in very good detail. We were blown away at the awesome customer service and him treating us like we were the only customers in the entire world. We went through and ordered our pizzas and the staff making the pies were also very friendly and made sure several times they had our orders right. There wasn't a long wait for the pizzas to be baked and then they were hand delivered to our table. The food was absolutely delicious and the prices were great too. My wife and I will be coming back time and time again and will recommend this place to everyone we know"}
{"text":"Great prices, great staff and amazing tasting pizza. I love this place, it's the only place I go to for pizza these days."}
{"text":"I did like it, but it's now closed.

There are other locations that you can go to though. You pick the pie, the sauces, the ingredients - everything is individual and included in the price. It's quick, and I usually come away with a bit left over."}
{"text":"I was given a recommendation from a co-worker about this place, so I decided to take my family with me for the experience.  I knew that it had recently opened up, but I was not aware that it was their second weekend.  They ran like a well oiled machine.  Everyone was pleasant, engaging with customers, happy, and hard working individuals.  The set up is much like Blaze Pizza in CA.  You choose your crust size - gluten free is available - (7-inch $5.49  or 11-inch $7.99), sauce, cheese(s) meats, veggies, and fresh toppings.  They have some combo pizzas choices you can choose from, or you can make your own.  You can have as many toppings on your pizza as you like - no extra charge.  They also have subs (3 choices and they all are $7.49), salads ($7.29), and dessert pies ($2.99).  Their drinks are All natural pure cane sugar soft drinks, Boylan's, and China Mist Iced Teas.  They also have a limited selection of wines and beers.  We made it through the line quickly, and were provided our meals in probably less than 15 minutes.  They were made to perfection!  There were individuals cleaning up tables, serving food, and asking patrons how their meal was.  The bathrooms were clean, tidy, and had a pleasant smell to them.  I am definitely bring more friends, family, and co-workers to this joint."}
{"text":"Love EP! Everything is fresh and made to order. Besto Pesto is my favorite! Servers are friendly and location is clean. The decor is eclectic and comfy seating. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really like the concept & the staff was super nice but they couldn't hear a word I said. I kept having to repeat my toppings. Kind of annoying but whatever. 
I only ordered a salad & was thrilled to be able to put as many toppings on as I liked. 
I didn't however like that the meats were ice cold i.e. Bacon, grilled chicken etc... I understand that most stuff gets cooked after you order it but if your having a salad, cold meats don't really work. The worst part of my visit were the salad dressings, they tasted very low quality & definitely not homemade and only four to choose from. Would have loved some balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette. Really no healthy choices :(
I ended up taking the salad home & using dressing from another restaurant.  
I'm anxious to try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"YUMMMM is the best way to describe this place. Buikd it yourself or get it straight of their menu. Either way, you cant lose."}
{"text":"Pretty good little place. 
Standard price for the size of your choice (7\" or 11\") and all the toppings you want at no additional charge. 
The pizza was good. Nothing spectacular but also nothing to complain about. All pizzas are thin crust. I got the Italian Wedding and my spouse got the Meaty Italiano. 
I will be returning."}
{"text":"Fantastic service from the top down!  Tyler Leija runs his restaurant like a well-oiled machine and his knowledge of his products and craft beers are impressive!!  

Tatyana Leija and Hayley Stout are unbelievable behind the counter.  They explained the process of how things work (we were \"virgin eklectics) and the ingredients used and even allowed a sample of stuff to my wife before having to order. This is what a restaurant should be like everywhere. Great People, Outstanding Customer Service and Delicious Food!!  KUDOS!!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place. The employees are fun to talk to. They make great, insightful recommendations. I ordered the pizza and was amazed by the flavor. Great crust, which in my mind makes or breaks a pizza, great flavor. I can't wait to come back to try another."}
{"text":"Good food! Chipotle style ordering. They even have vegan options such as dairy free cheese. They also have a gluten free crust. The atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"Excellent opening day!  Very fast and friendly service.  The pizzas were great!  The crust was really good, which is important.  

I built my own meatlovers style pizza with an alfredo sauce base, real mozzarella, shredded mozzarella, house recipe meatballs, spicy italian sausage, bacon, pepperoni, grilled chicken, black olives and mushrooms. It came out PERFECT.  The meats had great flavor and the fresh mozzarella was really nice.

My girlfriend made a pizza with a pesto base sauce, which she said was really good.  She also had a few different meats and lots of veggies.  She said hers was great as well.  We're both looking forward to leftovers!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The toppings are so fun to pile on, their fountain drinks are great and I love their child tours they have every month."}
{"text":"We have order threw them online for our work lunch and I love that you can order WHATEVER YOU WANT! and the price does not change. Amazing place food is great."}
{"text":"YUM! Stopped in for my first time because I had a coupon in the mail for an 11\" pizza ($6.99) which fully fed 2 people. The atmosphere was super laid back and funky urban which gave off a great vibe, the staff was excellent and on their game, super welcoming and helpful. The whole place was very clean and not busy at all for a Saturday night. My pizza was buffalo sauce, with fresh mozzarella/shredded cheese, with chicken. I purchased ranch with that and a large drink. Total came out to $9.57 or so. I was very impressed, from walking in to leaving I got great service, a comfortable dining experience, and PHENOMENAL pizza. WILL definitely be my new pizza place. It was fun watching the employmees make my pizza, it's almost like a chipotle but with pizza! Also the drinks are hip and cool, very tasty. (Cream soda and ginger ale are the ones I tried) YUM! 6/5 stars!"}
{"text":"I went to grab a bite to eat with low expectations since I haven't had the best luck with this style restaurant, but I was surprised by the taste and variety of options! I was guided by Tyler who helped me make a wonderful pizza. Johnathan and Leesha helped answer questions and the entire staff seemed knowledgeable and friendly. It's a really cool spot and I'll definitely be back. The craft soda and fresh teas were a huge surprise too!"}
{"text":"First let me say i do love all the build your own pizza places - it's a trend but as someone with food allergies, it makes ordering easy. I don't have to say I'll have that but without this and that... I can just ask for what I want. So I've been to a lot around the valley and Eklectic Pie is my favorite - the best choice of topping anywhere. Love the bacon, pulled pork and roasted potatoes. Also great crust. And adult beverages too. The decor is also fun."}
{"text":"I don't know how to put this exactly but I'll give it a try.   This place is perfect.  I got exactly what i wanted within a decent amount of time.  The desert pie was unexpectedly wonderful.  Super creative and I love the local ingredients.  Thank you owner of this wonderful mouth play-land."}
{"text":"Definitely the best make it your own type pizza place I've been to, beats Mod Pizza by a mile!! Ingredients are so fresh and their desserts are delicious!!"}
{"text":"How I miss this place. :( 

They were awesome and you could build your own pizza like at mod. They were great about seperation. 

It seemed they closed the Stapley location and I have not yet had the chance to go to Chandler."}
{"text":"Wow. The last 13 Reviews were 5 Star. SERIOUSLY? I'm not even going to beat around the bush on this one. The pizza was crap. Limp, wet crust. What else can I say. Maybe the ingredients were fresh, but why would it matter. I'm sure the ingredients are as fresh as all the other BYOP places. But what is pizza? Crust. Sauce. Toppings. All 3 have to work together.
C and I decided to stop by on our way to his rehearsal. He saw the sign the last time we drove thru Raising Cane's so we decided to give it a shot.
We both ordered the 11\" Build your own ($7.99 ea.) C's was basically a meat lovers. He added Marinara, Sausage, Pepperoni, Meatball and Fresh Mozz. Sounds good right? It would have been if the crust wasn't like a wet piece of Lavosh. Soggy, no support for the ingredients. Yuk. Now the taste of the toppings were fine. But the toppings don't make a pizza. 
I put Fresh Roma's, Fresh Mozz, Mushrooms, Onions, Marinara & Meatball on mine. The toppings and the sauce were fine but again, the crust was limp, wet, soggy mess. No Bueno.
The staff was really nice and the interior of Eklectic was very nice. I did think it was interesting the soda machine dispensed a \"specialty\" soda and not a more recoginized brand. But hey, to each there own. C had a chocolate milk ($1.79) and I had the China Mist Tea ($2.19). (My favorite brand)
Nice Staff. Nice Facility. Clean Dining Room. Good Toppings. Lousy Crust. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love pizza? But, having a family of four used to leave someone out. Now, we can each get our own pizzas with whatever we want and it's super affordable. My husband and I really enjoy good beer and they have the greatest selection. They let us sample each one and I chose the Koffee Kolsch! It's Sooo delicious. 
I pretty much added every vegetable they had to my pizza and the cost was the same. The fresh basil finisher with balsamic fig sauce was tasty. I recommend the wine country (mine) and the Besto pesto (his). The kids tore up the loaded potato. We will be back!"}
{"text":"After waiting in line we left. The gal putting together the pizzas, pulled some raw chicken wings out of the fridge and put them on a tray to be baked. She then went straight to the toppings wearing the same gloves covered in raw chicken. Didn't want to get sick, so we left."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now the first time I got the wine country which is a delicious pear spinach gorgonzola pizza. This time I decided on the Sgt. Peppers which i expect to be just as delicious I got the Tutti pie Fruitti it is so good i finished the whole thing with my bf i can not ussually eat that much but it was to good to pass up. They have delicious unique soda we got the root beer which k think has just a hint of vanilla but was oh so good. They also have birch beer soda yummy town U.S.A."}
{"text":"I love this place! I came when it first opened and it still has the same consistency! I can't help but tell all of my family and friends about it because it's one of mesa's best kept secrets (next to Tum Nuk Thai)! The pizzas are personalized and a personal sized, the prices are very well worth the portions, toppings are unlimited so definitely take advantage of them! Incredibly fresh, fast and good quality. The staff is quick, friendly, clean and efficient. The whole vibe is very comfortable and welcoming. The only thing i wish for is that you could get family sized pizzas and be able to share with everyone! It's perfect for a date night when you're craving one style and your significant other is craving another because you will both end up full and satisfied. I also recommend signing up for their email club, I can not wait to turn 21 so i can pair my meals with their local beer and wine! It is a must go to!"}
{"text":"Love love love love love. I appreciate that there's competition in the DIY pie arena. The prefab flavor combinations and idea boards really elevate your pie to the next level. Taste is on point along with quality, I enjoyed everything this eclectic pie had to offer."}
{"text":"Pizza was great. Fast service. Restaurant was clean and staff were friendly. Like the prices too! I will definitly go back. Welcome to the area Eclectic Pie!!!"}
