{"text":"Some of the reviews below are reviewing this place before they changed management, which was recently. By recently I mean between 6-12 months ago.

Went there for AYCE dinner, I paid $21 in total for everything (didn't order a drink). We were the only people in the restaurant, which was nice because the service was really fast.

Negative: we ordered the red dragon roll (dynamite + salmon on top), and the shrimp tempura inside tasted weird.

Positive: we told the staff about the weird-tasting food, and they gladly made us a new one for free. That one tasted fine.

The food was pretty good, but nothing too amazing..the only thing is that I'm not sure it's worth the price tag it comes with, and plus I only ate off of the dinner menu and can't vouch for the lunch service, price or menu. The sushi chef did however put a lot of effort into presentation and made flowers out of all the sashimi, which was a really nice touch.

I plan to go here again sometime to offer a more accurate review."}
{"text":"This is my one of my favorite all-you-can eat sushi spots in Toronto that's very reasonably priced for its selection and quality. Only $15.99 for dinner and you definitely get a bang for your buck as the sushi rolls and sashimi are fantastic! (green dragon and red dragon rolls are a must!) I haven't had one thing to complain about this place. Perfect for your quick sushi fix in the downtown area. (:"}
{"text":"Gf and I dropped in on sat afternoon for a quick snack. Sat in the front window. Waiter was way off. Had only one setting on the table and that's how it stayed. After our miso soup he left the bowls on our table the entire meal. During our meal the sushi maker behind us was spitting in the sink, blowing his nose into the sink and sneezing the entire time. It was rude and quite sick to be around while eating a meal out. Te food was alright. Cheap. Might try one more time.

{"text":"good food and very good price. the place is quiet unlike another reviewer's comment. I am a regular here. no negative experiences."}
{"text":"We were very happy with the  very attentive service from the one server handling the tables at this restaurant.   Some all you can eat establishments are not entirely friendly when they realize that you're actually there to eat all you can, and then some.  Not here. The server worked diligently and with charm to make our dining experience memorable.  Water refills were plentiful and we were given forms for our food order(s) without ever having to ask.  Food quality was excellent."}
{"text":"Their lunch special seving is huge. Itbcost only 6.77 including tax. 
Though other then that the food is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Went here on a weekend whilst taking a break from the whole 'doors open' site seeing. 

Decided on this place as it was the closest to the Fisher Rare Book Library (amazing place)

There were only two other people at the time, by the time we left this soon increased to 15 or so, and through that whole time the service seemed quick, friendly with only the one chef and one lady waiting on the tables.

I was attrached to the place as it does both Japanese and thai food however once seated I tried to ask the waitress whether any thai food was included in the 'All you can eat' and I never got a clear response because I am guessing she did not speak or understand much English. 

Nae bother,  I was there for food and food is what stuff myself with, so using a checklist type ordering system I went ahead and sensibly ordered some sushi for me and my friend. I think we had about three rounds of ordering before we were stuffed.

The food itself was prepared well and tasted good. I did not notice the Chef doing anything unsanitary (as mentioned in previous review) but then again we were sitting further away. 

The price is cheap, we did not order any drinks as we had our own water so really no complaints from either of us. 

BUT

Now I had had this fine sushi meal at 2.30pm. Felt fine all day but after getting home in the evening and having a power nap I woke at 9ish with the intention of going out, lo and behold I had such a terrible headache, a feeling of nausea and all in all felt really crappy. My night out started with me getting out of bed and remained in the confines of my bedroom with the only thing I was able to stomach being ice-cream.

Can not truly say whether this was the food's fault as my friend was fine and I have eaten in some dodgy places in Asia and never had any issues plus I ate in Egypt (worst food ever) and never felt this bad but then again I just do not feel like I did without reason. Therefore this place get 3/5 until proven guilty."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! The staff is friendly and the menu has lots of pictures. I especially love the Philly rolls, you should try them :)  It's a pretty standard sushi place with a cozy atmosphere and fair prices."}
{"text":"While the service here could be a bit better - they usually only have one very busy waitress serving the entire restaurant - the food is delicious, the price is very reasonable, and the restaurant has a great atmosphere. 

I generally go in for the all you can eat sushi lunch and haven't had any issues with the freshness of the food, though I'd suggest forgoing the chicken curry. 

It is one of my favourite places to eat on Spadina and will definitely go back again and again!"}
{"text":"I got take-out here the other night while at work. Someone convinced me to try somewhere other than Simon Sushi (another favourite in the same area)

We called in our order, and picked it up 15 min later. No waiting around, everything we asked for (including cutlery) was provided.

I ordered the Tom Yam (coconut chicken soup). It wasn't that good, would not recommend it. Not much coconut milk in it, nor could I taste lemongrass. Very average.

My sushi however was very yummy! I got eel and avocado roll. Their sushi rice is a little sweetened (or was in flavour in my roll?) which I really enjoyed. Much better than Simon's/Sushi World.

Overall, its pretty good for what you pay. My meal came to $11 with tax incl.

Oh, there is 10% discount on cash order s $25+. Always helps :)"}
{"text":"Sushi Star is one of the best (food-wise) all-you-can-eat Japanese restaurants I have come across in downtown Toronto. We walked in half hesitantly after perusing their relatively large menu and justifying to ourselves the $15.99 dinner time price ($19.99 gets you an even bigger menu to choose from). 

Despite it being dinner time, there were only two other tables of diners and no one to greet us at the door. There was a lady behind the counter, but she seemed to be having an argument with someone on the phone. 

Once seated though, all was forgotten and we were eager to get ticking (from the soy sauce stained DIY order form that already had some choices we had to first erase). The food was great! The bite sized sashimi slices were fresh. The light and crispy tempura was served hot from the fryer and comparable to the best ordered a la carte. The maki were dainty (which allows for the opportunity to try a larger variety) and had a great rice to filling ratio. The sanma was perfectly seared with a salty crispy skin and juicy medium-rare fillet.

Although water refills were constant, the rest of the service was quite abrupt and mostly without a smile. They were extremely busy though and most of the platters that went to surrounding tables were the size of miniature boats. When we left (carrying our bellies), almost all of the tables were filled with large groups and families.

Perhaps the reason why everyone showed up so much later and with such huge appetites was because they had all been engaging in vigorous excercise beforehand. With sushi that good, it might not be a bad idea to consider for next time."}
{"text":"MIO has really gone down hill over the past few months. 

This has not been my regular sushi joint for a while, since the opening (or maybe since me noticing) a better place at College / Spadina. 

I had a few people to help me move the other day, and I decided to buy everyone lunch. I stopped by MIO because I know they have lunch specials, and was SO disappointed with my meal(s). I ordered 4 maki roll combos, and it took 45 minutes! At the time, no one else was in the restaurant - and then when tables were seated, they got their food before me! I tried to complain, but the service staff was basically MIA. 

Once I got home, the sushi was just bad. I don't think it was the fish, but actually the rice... it just tasted terrible. We all forced down a few pieces and continued with the move, but needless to say I won't be back!"}
