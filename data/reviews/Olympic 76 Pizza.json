{"text":"I recently tried out this place after seeing high praise on Yelp and other sites.   On first impression, the outside is quite unassuming. I have walked past this place numerous times (I live two streets north) and have not noticed it, due to it's limited promotion on the exterior. I generally assumed it was a practice of some sort without really looking at it.   As we walked in we were confused as to if we should seat ourselves or not. Waited two minutes and a server looked at us but did not greet us. We sat ourselves. As other reviewers have commented, the décor inside is quite dated. It reminded me of a restaurant you'd go to with family from the '90s that hasn't changed since.  Upon entering the restaurant (on a Saturday night), I believe my girlfriend and I were the only people under 50 (with the exception of a family with a young child). This threw us off a bit, but wasn't really that important as a whole, just interesting to see. Another younger couple walked in about halfway through our meal.  We  both ordered pizza, of course. Hawaiian and a chicken-based one were our choices to share. The were quite simple, basic, a refreshing change to today's trend of trying to stand out with non-traditional toppings and styles. The pizza itself was pretty good. Size was acceptable, not giant, but not small. It was cooked well. The toppings were good, but nothing outstanding. I am an absolute cheese lover, however, it ALMOST had too much, which is tough for me to say. It borderline overpowered everything else about the 'za. If they could lighten up JUST A BIT, this would be an excellent 4 star pizza. In it's current form, I give it a 3.  I would go back sometime, but it won't become my go-to restaurant for a favourite dinner."}
{"text":"I am from Montreal and I've been living in Toronto for 20 years. Olympic Pizza has the best Pizza in Toronto no doubt. Like the ones I used to like in Montreal. I keep coming back to Olympic and I will not have Pizza anywhere else in Toronto. The restaurant is ''rustic'' but the food and service is always consistent and fantastic. Thanks to Carlos, Isabel and staff.."}
{"text":"Haven't lived in Toronto for years now but this was my neighborhood favorite for a good solid pizza.  Nothing fancy, just fresh, tasty and filling.  I would bicycle over any time of year for a small pizza and coke to take home on my handlebars.  I'm sure it's still awesome."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Had the Canadian and the pesto. tasty. i reserve 4 stars for places where i have an awesome meal and 5 stars for the perfect experience so i hope 3 stars still means Good on yelp."}
{"text":"I know it's déclassé, but I love this place.  The dining room looks like it hasn't been updated since the seventies, the menus are laminated, and the place is lit with hundred watt bulbs, but the food is rich and filling and charmingly old-fashioned.  (The garlic bread comes smothered in mozzarella; if you want grilled chicken on your sandwich, it costs a dollar more; and whole wheat pizza crust is only available if you're ordering a personal size pizza.)    It's a great place to go when you've got some time to linger--the staff isn't the kind to kick you out to make room for new guests, and the meals are incredibly cheap for the size of the portions (dinner for two came to just over $20, though we didn't order alcohol)."}
{"text":"Still the best calzone in town  Get the meat sauce mmmmmm.   Deep fried Crust makes it nice and crispy and oh so good.    Do not miss opportunity to enjoy their outdoor patio.   Truly one of the hidden food gems of Toronto.   Make it a regular stop"}
{"text":"Not overly impressed.. Was cheap and if filled the stomach but wasn't nothing to brag about. It was fresh however it was very plain tasting. Patio was nice to sit on. Don't think I'd be returning as I'd label the food below average. Server had a bit of an attitude, did not like service at all."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place. Me and my partner went in for a bit to eat and ordered the panzerotto and greek salad. The salad was loaded with feta and the panzerotto was delicious.  Overall, extremely great value but also downright delicious food. The place was very unpretentious and had a really homey vibe to it that was so charming. This place is so tucked away that I never knew it existed.  I will definitely recommend this to my friends."}
{"text":"Pizza had a hair in it. The waiter (thin, white hair, thick accent) brought us the bill. We asked him if we could pay separately, he replied \"too late\" as he walked away.. Rude!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the best tasting pizza since Mother's Pizza closed up.  Great sauce and generous cheese.   They gotta start a delivery service."}
{"text":"Good pizza and friendly staff. At night family of 6 raccoons comes and visits from a neighbouring tree"}
{"text":"Talk about dinner time drama! The staff were playing out an episode of \"hate me now and don't teach the new girl!\" Collin is in the lead role of drama queen! I have never felt so uncomfortable!! The new girl and the owner had an exchange of words out on the dining room floor in front of customers about Colin taking her tables. Not very professional to be having such discussion on the dining room floor. Then to add to it  Colin has to make unprofessional comments as he walked in and out from the patio about the new girl. I am thinking a better approach would have been to help the new girl since it was her second day. Not a very good team player. I won't be back here for all of the drama from the staff. Food was just ok. Our friends ordered a salad and they messed it up and got chicken on it that they did not want. When they mentioned this to the owner he acted like he did not care and said chicken is expensive and made them pay for it."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best pizzas ive ever eaten. The panzorotti and the meat lover so far. Even though the place is not up to date. It does have and authentic feel to it."}
{"text":"I go to this place a few times a year, maybe 10. It's tucked away, off of yonge, it's discreet. It's good. Really good.  The outside is really not an eye grabber. It is nice to sit on the patio in the summer though. This place is what you call a hidden gem. The restaurant's interior is awful, blatantly awful. Don't let it deter you though.  The pizza is without question, the best I have ever had. The pasta's are alright too, same with the garlic bread. Everything on the menu is really pretty decent, but if it's your first time, make it a pizza (seriously).   The pizza is always consistent, cooked to perfection. The thing i hate most is when a pizza is soggy, and the cheese is too gooey. At Olympic it has always been just right. The ingredients are fresh and delicious, they use just the right amount of cheese, and know how to make some good dough. Truly incredible pizza experience.  The serving staff seems to experience a fair amount of turnover. Except for my main man Carlos. They're always fairly good servers anyway though.  If you want to experience a pizza that may very well change your life, give this place a visit. The food isn't really expensive either, don't count on spending more than 20/person unless you're drinking.   The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is simply how filthy the mens bathroom is. In all fairness I'm a little germaphobic though."}
{"text":"We discovered this place a year or so ago and have picked up a few pizzas over that time and really enjoyed them. On our most recent visit however we discovered that the menu had changed - the pizzas are much smaller and the prices increased. I think the management may have changed as well. The pizza was OK but much smaller and more expensive than it was in the past. the 16\" deluxe went from $23 to $35 overnight. We got a 12\" for more than we use to pay for the 16\" and it was too small. The 18\" pizza disappeared.  We are now looking around for a new neighbourhood go-to mom and pop pizza place to replace Olympic 76. My guess is we are not the only regulars who are disappointed with the change. Shame."}
{"text":"Yum!! A couple friend's told me this was their favourite pizza joint in town so I decided to give it a try.  This pizza is LOADED with delicious toppings. They have a big patio, good beer and entertaining and accommodating wait staff. It easily lived up to all the hype. I've had both take-out and dined in at this place already this summer and am sure I'll be back.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I am telling you. Trust me! This is the best pizza restaurant!!! It's so good. It taste good and that's what matters to me. The restaurant owner has been running this family business for a while and I believe that the dedication to make this quality of the pizza doesn't just happen. I just have days where I don't want to have cheap pizza. Make sure to try half and half pizza- you can order half Hawaiian and half pepperoni if you want - I think it was like a dollar difference."}
{"text":"This Pizza! OH MY GOODNESS THIS PIZZA! Its what I've been searching for in Toronto my entire life (here). How to describe it - old school, mom and pop joint pizza, with a fluffy crust, delicious sauce and beautiful gooey mozzarella. The service has been fantastic, they have Sleeman on tap (a great pitcher or pint to go with your pie), and the pizza! YUM! Apps (mozzarella sticks, fries, chicken strips, caesar salad) are all just 'okay' but the main star is definitely the pizza.   Like so many others, I really wish they'd deliver, but its probably for the best for my waistline that they don't!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our first visit and will definitely be back!  An old school family style pizzeria.  Very fresh ingredients.  Delicious crust and real mozzarella cheese.  Service was efficient and not overbearing."}
{"text":"Pizzas are average, but entrées are pretty good. I like the panzerotti which has a big portion for the price. The pasts are good too but a bit pricier.  Service is prompt but not the friendliest. Has plenty of space for big groups but awful about separate bills. Don't bring large groups (10+) and expect them to do separate bills unless you enjoy a headache at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"Classic old school pizza joint. Came here for a snack last night with my boys. We had beers and 8' and 12' inch pies. (meat lovers!). Good old school thick pizza with lots of cheese, toppings and dough. Not the most tasty I've had but they supply chili flakes and parm for extra punch.  Reminds me a lot of an old school place called the Colonnade in Ottawa, right down to the decor and the menu.   Decent old school pies..."}
{"text":"I've finally found my fav pizza place in my area! I had the pesto pizza and wow! Great service too. Looking forward to checking out the patio this year!"}
{"text":"I liked the sauce to cheese ratio. Picked up to go  with a group of co-workers.Service was fast I didnt like the option of not getting separate bills they should have told us beforehand but understandable. I ordered a double cheese pineapple  personal pizza and chicken salad. The chicken was salty so I didnt eat it . Overall it was ok , at least i tried a Toronto staple"}
{"text":"Toronto has a lot of fabulous, upscale pizza spots (Libretto, etc.) and dozens of takeout chains.  But unless you're craving a quick slice or a gourmet meal, Olympic pizza hits the spot for down-home delicious pizza.    Olympic may look a little sketchy, but it's a successful family-run place that's been around for years.  My father-in-law used to go there religiously while in med school and I think he still fantasizes about their meatball and chicken sandwiches    The food is simply prepared - nothing fancy, few extras - but everything just tastes really good.  Salads are fresh and crunchy.  The pizza crust is crisp on the outside and super chewy on the inside - just perfect.  Pies are saucy and generous.  Kind of like what I always imagined the pizza tasted like in that 1980s movie Mystic Pizza.  (C'mon, it was a good movie!)  The sandwiches are also really tasty.  Two big thumbs up for this place.  It's true, service can sometimes be slow (although sometimes it's great), but the pies are divine.  Vegetarian Score: 7.5/10.  Average for a pizza place.  Vegans will have a hard time."}
{"text":"We are so disappointed! My partner in crime and I had a date there a few weeks ago as we were feeling the desire for some pasta. So I ordered their Fettucini Alfredo with Ham and Egg and she ordered the Fettuccine Arrabiata.  They were good portions and the  food had a very homey, low-key and unpretentious vibe to it and  the wine we had went well with our meal.   \"I have been meaning to come here for ages,\" I said to her, \"I am happy we both like it, specially since their website is broken and there is no online menu...\" I remember saying...  Yet, overall we thought of it as a rustic, straightforward locale and we made a point to return again for some of their pizza.  So we did that this weekend after working out and we were starving. We ordered the straight and simple 'sauce and cheese' with goat cheese as an extra topic. The pizza came fast and we began munching away. To be honest the pizza was pretty good, not Italy-good but not bad at all.  Then suddenly, as we chatted, finishing our acqua gassata. when and without much aplomb, a black mouse scurried right through middle of the dinning area. Just like that. Comfortable and assured, as if it owned the place.   So as we both stared quietly, Mickey made a dash for the wall and still in full view, my GF asked, \"Uh, should we say something?\" ...As we were the only ones who noticed him, it was just hanging there for a few seconds, under a random table.   I got up and walked pretty close to where it was, and once he saw me he ran past the bar and into the kitchen. Not even 6-7 feet from me.   'Hi,\" I said in a hushed tone, \"Just to let you know, you got a mouse right here,\" pointing towards where I had just seen Mickey dash into the bar.  Now, there were two servers at the bar, a younger girl and an older gentleman. The young girl was surprised and said \"WHERE?!\"   The older gentlemen, said nothing and quietly went into the kitchen, and came out a minute later and just asked \"Where is the mouse?\" to the young girl and that was it. They said nothing else or did nothing beyond that and it is THIS attitude which truly disappointed us.     Look, if you really think about it realistically, all restaurants may or can have some sort of vermin. It is just a fact. I mean, if you ever see one mouse in your home it does not imply that you are a pig, right?  However as customers we try not think of that for the sake of our dining experience and the fact that no one wants to think there are mice in the kitchen snacking on the nuts that are going to end up on your salad.  ;-)  What troubled us was the older man --who looked like an owner/manager and who seemed to *KNOW*  they had mice, as he seemed, oh, so not-surprised.   He said nothing and nonchalantly seemed to ignored the importance of a customer telling him he had seen a mouse running calmly THROUGH THEIR DINNING ROOM FLOOR...  Unlike the young girl who raised her voiced in surprise and actually began actively looking for it.   At one point the cook came out to the bar for a minute and looked at us and then went back to the kitchen. Apparently no other customers noticed.   FUN FACT: Mice are animals who live in constant fear of being eaten and as such they naturally tend to travel next to walls to minimize getting surprised by predators. If a mouse feels comfortable running through open spaces it is because they *feel* safe. QUESTION: Why would a mouse feel comfortable running through an open space in this restaurant? ...Not because a cat is going to feast on it, that's for sure.    If I was a  manager, or heck an employee, I would have come out and offered some sort of well... anything! To acknowledge some sort of responsibility, ownership, perhaps offered to make amends somehow, anyhow! Even an empty apology would have helped. They are a restaurant after all!  Instead, nothing. Maybe it was because we had already paid? Who knows. So we were just surprised. A bit disappointed in the end by having to finalize this Yelp review by stating:    We are never going back and I would suggest you do not go through our experience either."}
{"text":"Olympic continues to be one of the best places for Pizza in downtown Toronto. It's located in what used to be a fancy restaurant called \"Fentons\". (anyone remember it?!). The decor is lovely, the servers are friendly, the atmosphere is fun and the food is fantastic!! It's not a fast food pizza place. You order from the menu and your pizza (or whatever pasta dish you chose) and it's brought to your table. Much nicer than places that throw it in a box and you have to take it home or then go sit at a table. Thank you Olympic for all the years of great food."}
{"text":"Great chicken parm and panzos. Generous portions.  The meat sauce reminds me of my grandmother's. So good!"}
{"text":"I'd have to say that the service wasn't the most amazing but the people try to accommodate your choices as best as they can. I had a vegetarian pizza and asked to swap the sauce to pesto, with that they gave me free garlic bread and 10% the entire order which was very kind. The food was pretty good but it did make me sick afterwards."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Came here for a casual dinner. Read the reviews and was intrigued. The pizza dough was so delish and toppings were plenty. The service was also prompt. The decor of the place is very simple but it works well. Definitely will return again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Pizza !   I order from here about once a month to pick up and in the spring/summer the patio is really nice.  Good old fashion pizza and old time toppings !   Shame that they need to move - hopefully they will find a place close by."}
{"text":"Pizza was the best I have had in Toronto, but the sauce was lacking a little flavor.  The crust and toppings were perfect though.  Had the Ceasar Salad and House Salad, both were yummy!  Service was slow (server kept texting behind the bar)."}
{"text":"This is a great neighbourhood restaurant. Have been coming here for over 30 years and it's incredibly consistent. No fancy airs about it, just good, wholesome, traditional American-Italian food.  Have our 3 favourites we always order: 1) Pesto Pizza on whole wheat crust (an option on the 9\" size only). Pesto sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, black olives, spinach, artichoke hearts, mozzarella, and goat cheese. Vegetarian option and yummy. Makes 4-slices so it is filling, but not crazy. Sometimes, I add chicken, but not often now.  2) Better-half is addicted to Panzerotto (deep fried!, but baked option available). Always gets pepperoni, mushrooms, & green peppers with meat sauce on the side. Very filling, even when he tries to not eat all the crust.  3) Caesar Salad - when we're hungry OR if we split a pizza (Ultimate Chicken is the agreed upon option), we split the Large as an appetizer. Nothing fancy, just good grub and really large.  Haven't had anything here that I disliked, just don't have foodie expectations.  In the summer, we love to sit on the patio in front and enjoy the weather.  Place is large so we've always found seats even when it's busy. If you have a large group, call for a reservation."}
{"text":"I've visited Olympic 76 thrice now, with perfectly consistent, very positive, always massively cheesy results.   I originally was going to give this a 3, because I don't think this is a top-tier Toronto pizza place. But I think I just feel that way because Olympic is not a traditional pizza. I don't know where I'd file it...certainly it isn't VPN pizza, and it isn't delivery-grade either. There are hints of nostalgic, Chuck-e-Cheese-esque flavour. It is a deep, very filling pie sort of bordering on Chicago-style, with a New Yorkian crust. Sort of like a Frankenpizza, borrowing the best elements from a number of pizza types.  Olympic loads on the toppings - they do not skimp - but they don't overload. Last night I had a mushroom, onion and spinach pie, which was great, and a perfect ratio of ingredients. Normally, my girlfriend and I like anchovies, and they do a great job of making sure every bite has a bit of salty fish in it (unlike Dominoes, who tend to cut one tiny anchovy into 6 pieces and miserly distribute one little piece per slice).  The decor is, as described by many, very outdated, and the lights are very bright, but there is a charm to it. In the summer you can sit on the fantastic patio anyway.  The pies are great, but also very affordable - three people can easily split one large 18\" for under 10 dollars each. The salads are massive as well.  Absolutely check this place out, if you're looking for an original style of pizza, with good service, at good prices."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a good calzone / baked panzerotti in Toronto. One thing I've noticed is that Toronto calzones are really made as \"meal sized\"... Not to mention the lack of ability to pre-choose my own toppings and being forced to choose between Pepperoni or Veggie. Some of my pre-Toronto calzone experience was more like a large pizza folded in half creating a football sized endeavour in which you had full control of toppings, and one would not even think of eating the whole thing in one sitting.   But after a number of mediocre experiences elsewhere throughout the city, a calzone craving came that would not subside, and I found this place online with good reviews so decided to give them a call with a takeout order.  The calzone is the exact size to fill a plate filled with the 3 toppings of your choice, making for the perfect sized meal. It was good, the toppings were adequate and I really have no complaints. I will say that the $25 price tag (after tax before tip) for 2 with tasty meat sauce on the side is a fair offer. So far, it's probably the best calzone I've found in the city. While I was not amazed, I was satisfied, so I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I do like the food here but the service is so bad I really recommend avoiding this place. Slow service and the bad attitudes of the propietors/servers are enough to send me most anywhere else for lunch."}
{"text":"The food is generally okay...they bring a shaker of fake bacon bits for the Caesar salad...but the pizza is good. Way better than the cranky dude serving it to you."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza I've had in a long time!  I checked it out on a whim, I went through Yelp reviews and thought it looked pretty good and was absolutely not disappointed. My husband said it was the best pizza he's had in a long time, and I would have to agree. Way better than Pizza Pizza or Pizzaiolo, and less expensive. The sauce was really nice, I generally don't really care for sauce and put up with it for the rest of the pizza, but this was really nice-- spices that gave it a really great depth. A really reasonable amount of cheese -- there is nothing I hate more than having pizza with not enough cheese, cause then why are we even here!?!? Not the case with this pizza, I felt completely satisfied.  We picked it up, so we got free garlic bread, which was a nice extra for fun. The staff were quite friendly over the phone and in person, we could not be more happy with having chose this place just by chance."}
{"text":"I feel like the Expedia guy who's combed 1000 beaches in search of the perfect one, except I found the perfect pizza!!      Ex-Montrealers rejoice!! This pizza is as close to Montreal style high end pizza as you're going to find in Toronto. Delicious hand made dough fluffy crust, great sauce, toppings on the bottom!! Real mozzarella on top and a fair amount to boot!   Olympic 76 pizza is by far the best pizza in the entire GTA!!! Believe me I've been searching for the better part of a decade! From Hamilton to Woodbridge to little Italy to Scarborough, NOBODY comes close!  I recommend the deluxe, hold the tomatoes!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. But service sucks.  I left my bag there with my prescribed medicines, my glasses and important stuff in it. I came back after five minutes to pick it up, they said they didn't find any bag. I saw the server taking that bag and keeping it in his box. The server blatantly lied and kept on denying that he had it. The manager joined in too and said that they couldn't care less. Fucking thieves! Pieces of shit!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  The only thing I don't like about this place is that it doesn't deliver!    I come from Windsor, Ontario where pizza is quite well known.  My brother and I are constantly on the search for a good thicker crust (but not deep dish) pizza in Toronto, and this is in first place for me.  I've only had the Hawaii pizza so far, but it was absolutely amazing.    I can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"Decent pizza and good drinks at reasonable prices. The interior is straight out of the 90s but if you can look past that this is a good place to grab pizza if you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"After being a 30 year customer at Olympic Pizza, I am now \" Officially Done \" - Not only has there been a serious increase in price ( which I assume is due to the added labour costs with the change to the minimum wage ) BUT the reduction in the size of the slices is ridiculous.  I ordered 2 - 8\" for pick up & returned home to discover that not only were the 4 slices, each being smaller than a slice of bread, but the pizza ONLY measured just over 7\" - I was Livid & promptly returned the 2 pizza's and got my money back. What a shame as it was once such an amazing place. I wish them luck in surviving !!"}
{"text":"This restaurant defiantly needs a face lift, but if you don't mind the surroundings try the classic pizza. Hands down best pizza in the city. Crust is light and crunchy, the toppings are the perfect ratio and the cheese is plentiful without being greasy."}
{"text":"This pizza brings me back. My family and I always went here whenever we decided to come downtown. The pizza is so yummy and old school, you almost feel like there's a little old italian grandmother in the back pounding out the dough (I don't know if there is, but that's what I think about when I eat this pizza). Vibe is very chill, relaxed and definitely family-friendly. Never had a bad meal here, and always plenty to go around!"}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza in town, and the most affordable.  Quaint little place right of Yonge st. .... panzerottos, spaghettis, lasagne, etc.......   They take reservations for a group - bar service too.  Patio looking on to Gloucester.  Service a little slow when they're busy, and they do get busy during dinner simply because the food is so good, and it's more than reasonable!"}
{"text":"Old school charm, old school style and just excellent pizza. Reminds of times my dad used to take me to a real pizzeria - which this is.   Service is excellent (a bit iffy if you are just doing a pick up - paid parking on the lane just next door)."}
{"text":"It has a very authentic Italian pizza and pasta selection. The ambience is very homey. Great place for a casual night out with friends. Food is served with the right amount of flavor and cheese. Portion is great. You will be guaranteed to have a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"This is exactly the kind of pizza place I've been looking for! Amazing topping heavy pizza, generous pour on the wine, checked table cloths and good prices. My friends and I had a great time! We ordered the deluxe, vegetarian and two \"make your own\" pizzas and everyone left happy. It's a very simple and unassuming environment and the owners were lovely. This is definitely going to be my go-to pizza place from now on!"}
{"text":"The food is great. The service is meh. That's the point.  If you've read my reviews before (and I'm flattered if you have), you'll probably notice that I keep coming back to certain themes. One of the big ones is my lament for the loss of small, independent, old-school restaurants in favour of higher end options and chains.   I value inexpensive, tasty food that lets me feed my family and gives me a break from cooking once or twice a week. I welcome the chance to go for lunch with work colleagues and not feel like I'm burning a mortgage payment.  Time was, pizza provided the answer to these and all other problems. I grew up near a few local joints that offered huge slices or massive pies to take out, but in time they've all closed in favour of the stingily-topped, stretchily-cheesed cardboard you find at chains I won't mention here. Or else fancy Neapolitan joints that serve great individual-sized pies at $20 a head. Which is a lot when my internal price guide says a slice is worth no more than $4 (and that's tougher and tougher to find these days).   Olympic 76 is the kind of throw-back place I love. Has it been around that long? I dunno. I've been going since I landed my first government job almost 10 years ago, so that's something. In those early days it offered solid pizza at great value-perfect for office lunch club. They offer an expansive red-sauce Italian menu but to be honest I only ever ordered pizza (or better) it's folded and deep-fried cousin, the panzerotto. Order a 3 topping job with a side of meat or marinara sauce (you're already ordering a deep fried ball of dough and cheese, get the meat), shake on a liberal amount of pepperoncino and 'parm', and you've got a molten delicious lunch for well under $20. Toppings are fresh and plentiful, cheese is fresh and sauce is tangy...even better, the crust has actual flavour and bubbles properly at the edges.   Service is all business-grim determination in the face of the lunch rush...but I'm not here to chat, I'm here to carbo-load.   True, it's gotten more expensive, and add-ons can raise the price faster than I'd like, but when I feel nostalgic or just hungry, there are few places I'd rather be for lunch."}
{"text":"Love this hidden gem in the city. Now that were experiencing patio weather i'll be going more often. When I'm craving american Italian pizza this is the spot to go. My order is bacon, mushrooms, pineapple and jalapeños. Can't go wrong. You definitely don't need extra cheese, they put plenty of cheese on it."}
{"text":"I was in the neighbourhood for Pride and felt a little peck-ish! I decided to look for a patio that wasn't too crowded but still gave me a decent view of the parade.  Olympic 76 fit the part and offered up some superb pizza. I liked that the toppings were fresh and whole: full slices of mushrooms, back and more cheese than you can shake a stick at!  The service was good but I thought it was odd that my Long Island Iced Tea came in in a plastic beer cup."}
{"text":"Used to Love this place , been going here for years , the decor is old school and the carpet flooring is gross but overlooked by the great pizza  Unfortunately as of late  their sizes have changed a and it's very  disappointing the x-large size is now a large and at $32.00 is a bit much granted it's good  pizza but at that price they just made the experience more expensive and it's just not worth it for me anymore."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great classic pizzeria, Olympic 76 is the best.  Besides the pizza being amazing, the chicken parm is outstanding.    In the summer the patio is fantastic, inside it hasn't been renovated since 1976 but that is the appeal.  Amazing pizzeria with classic family restaurant look.  Great place for a date or when you need something classic and good."}
{"text":"Decided to visit as we were close by and the reviews were pretty high. We ended up leaving pretty disappointed. We ordered the meat lovers pizza, which was just OK. The worst part of our visit here was the service. The man who was serving us was very passive aggressive. He was helping customers who visit on the regular and completely ignored us.  Will not be returning.."}
