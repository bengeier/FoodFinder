{"text":"My favourite sushi place in Montreal.
Even though the place is small it is worth trying. You can either eat in or take out (you can call to place your order). The service is fast.
They have a pretty good variety of sushi and it is a good quality for the price. Their ingredients are so fresh and the sushi well prepared. 
I am always tempted to stop by whenever  I am in the Cote des neiges area."}
{"text":"Pretty good value here. Super fast service as well. Took them only 10 mins to make me a 40 piece platter to go. Taste and quality is above average for Montreal."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi I have ever had! 
Friendly staff, fast service and the sushi is amazing! 
...The only downside is that they don't deliver and they don't have much place to sit. 
It's hard to find parking at time too since it is on a busy street. 
But besides that, I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone who loves sushi! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi servi très rapidement à manger sur place ou pour emporter. Les employés sont très polis et agréables. Le restaurant est propre et les aliments de très bonne qualité. Ça fait des années que je viens ici. N'oubliez pas de demander vos étampes de la carte fidélité. La salade Kashin est sublime."}
{"text":"Small restaurant that is ideal for takeout sushi. The menu variety is good and the food tastes great. Fair prices too.
Pictured here is the 40 piece platter I ordered for takeout. Good value for the price and delicious!"}
{"text":"This sushi place is probably the best I ate at so far, the service is fast, the food is fresh and it doesn't cost too much. For example we took two times the Avocado Small Maki (12pcx total), and two kind of Big Maki (10pcx total), we ate that for two and it cost less than 23$ with tax and tips. I used to go to all you can it sushi places and none of them has better makis than this one and are kinda expensive for someone that doesn't eat a lot. Must try. And do not forget your fidelity card!"}
{"text":"Great pickup sushi location in upper cote des neiges. There are a few seats to eat in but I always grab it to go. They have a fridge with pre made combos (never tried)  as well as drinks and they also sell Oriental decorations. 

The food is delicious and they are very quick to prepare it on the spot.  The prices are also very good. They take debit (minimum 5$) as well as credit (minimum 10$). They also have a loyalty program card (see in my linked pictures how it works)"}
{"text":"Once upon a time I had a huge craving for sushi.  I knew this place existed a few blocks from yours truly, so I made the trek there.  It was pretty bare-bones, but you don't need all that much fancy pants stuff to impress me, sushi-wise.  I ordered the veggie sushi to go.  The clerk couldn't speak French.  Normally I wouldn't care, but it frustrates me when I imagine anyone in my family coming to a place like this and what they would do.  What, they'd just leave in frustration because of the enormous language barrier?  So to me that's sort of a negative point.  But for my own experience it didn't take anything away as I speak fluent Japanese (just kidding).  I watched the clerk make the sushi.  She did it with the air of someone who has done it a thousand times, but with a smile on her face.

I ate the veggie sushi at home.  It was decent.  It lacked some love, but there was enough like in it for me to go back when I get that craving again."}
{"text":"When it comes to sushis, I can be very picky... Unless it's lunch and I don't have much time and I just want my sushis... On those occasions, Kashin, being very near my place of work (yes I do work sometimes... between two tastings and only to finance these said tastings!) is the place I go to.
Their sushis have nothing exceptional beside the fact that they are sushis.
I usually take them to go as the inside is very small and eat them in the nearby park - unless it's winter (I might be crazy, I'm not that crazy), in which case I go back to my office to eat... and here I am again, sharing uninteresting information... 
Anyway, so yes, good shushis but nothing more. Too much sauce for my taste but that seems to be a common pattern among sushi makers in north america! But don't worry Kashin, as long as there are lunches, I will come back to you as my cravings come too!"}
{"text":"This is more of a take out place than a resturant. They so have some 2-3 tables and a bar you can sit in, but the atmosphete or vibe is \"eat and go\": empthy walls, empthy shelves and old phone books. 
BUT
The fois itself is pretty good. I liked how they had the Japanese bread crumbs which gives it a bit more cruncy feeling. Reasobly priced and goid. If I was living in the area I am sure I would order my take outs from here once in a while"}
