{"text":"I came here on my way to school the other day and didn't get the chance to sit down and eat there but they are express so you can always do a take out which is pretty quick, i ordered teriyaki chicken with broccoli and can't wait to try what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese places I've ever been to. Reminds me of the old Kyoto Bowl place but this is way better. It's fresh tasting and has great portions. I go to school at GCC and for lunch I will usually go there once in a while. Great sushi and love the teriyaki bowls. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I would give this place no stars! I was just here and there only thing on kids menu is teriyaki chicken.. so I tried to get noodles but just in smaller container.. I was willing to pay the whole price I just didn't want that big container they put noodles in and it would of been a waste too especially for my 4yr old.. & they refuse to give me noodles in a smaller container.. but the lady said you can buy it with the big container, and I'll give you the small on the side???? At that point I walked out!! Can't deal with dumb people.. All I'm saying is they have bad customer service and to top it off it smelled rotten in there.. I won't come back again.."}
{"text":"OMG. This food is ridiculous I got and ordered it over the phone came and got it. Went home start to eat it the rice roll wasn't even cooked all the way. It felt like the fish had been out for too long. This was one of the worst sushi places I have ever been to and guarantee I will not come back it was a waste of my $13."}
{"text":"The whole family loved the food. Kids really enjoyed the noodles and teriyaki chicken. I tried the Firecracker Roll and it was delicious. It was small compared to the size of roll you get in So Cal, but the flavors where there and exceeded expectations for a fast food joint. The service was excellent and place was kept clean. We are adding this place to our reoccurring  list of places to eat!"}
{"text":"Basically, fast food Sushi. Two thumbs down for customer service and cleanliness. I will never dine here again."}
{"text":"Like their Terriyaki bowl and also the bulgogi, sushi is also a good choice here are well. Haven't ventured much on their other items maybe one day..."}
{"text":"Love this place. New obsession. So tasty and the price is RIGHT. It does take a little longer to get your food, because it's so fresh. So fresh and so good."}
{"text":"Japan Express has never let me down, go there every couple weeks. The food is fresh, consistent and very tasty. I have made a number of recommendations to others and have never heard a negative report, give them a try, you will be pleased."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the spicy teriyaki chicken for years but last night 8pm...was not their best. The chicken and teriyaki flavor was way off."}
{"text":"I like..no, wait...I LOVE the spicy teriyaki bowl with green onions on top. I remember making my husband drive multiple times all the way to Glendale to buy me some while pregnant with our last child 5 years ago. Even now driving the 45 minutes to get there is worth it. Can't find a place to satisfy my taste buds like it where I live & believe me I tried. (Best food discovery while attending GCC years ago.)"}
{"text":"I read some of review - I don't know what these people are from. Maybe Scottsdale. I like a hole in the wall place - they have awesome little fast food dishes that don't taste like fast food. it is way better than Kyoto Bowl.   I love their sushi especially one that tastes like kimbap. try their pork bulgogi if you like spicy food. Obento is awesome too - I love their katsu (deep fried breaded pork). In this economy, I cannot afford scottsdale restaurant and I hate waiting. I stop by this place at least twice a month."}
{"text":"Love the Hawaiian roll and the sunshine roll! Great service... decent prices for awesome sushi. Im a regular customer."}
{"text":"I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl. The chicken was awesome but the egg rolls sucked a$$!! They messed them up 2 times. They were hot in the outside and cold on the inside. Don't eat here unless you like egg roll Popsicles."}
{"text":"All I can say is this place has awesome food, my sister came from Cali and I told her about this place, so we went to eat, she loved it! I had the chicken teriyaki with steam vegs everything was. To die for & the sushi is not very expensive & fresh, the deep fried crunch roll, omg lol oh and the serve was good also."}
{"text":"First visit to Japan Express, but won't be my last. I ordered the Obento as it has a nice sample of several dishes. It has teriyaki chicken, pork fritter, 2 gyoza (dumplings), steamed rice and a small salad.  The gyoza are amazing and are delicious with a bit of sriracha. The home made tonkatsu sauce is a great complement to the breaded pork strips. The teriyaki chicken is great also and I was told it is a family recipe that they've been using for 30 years.  Great food and quite affordable. I will definitely be back. Especially for those dumplings!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. My husband and I go there all the time and it was good. Decided to order some sushi online since we had some friends over. .. $57 worth of crap! It Was embarrassing putting that food in front of them. Stuffed jalapeños were overcooked, tuna was tasteless..overall not worth the money. Never again :("}
{"text":"Even if I didn't live so close, I would still be here on a regular basis! The staff are so friendly, and really make sure the food takes excellent. I've been coming here on my own for months now, and they have never failed to greet me as I walk in, even if it's just with a smile.   The rice bowls are always a hit, and their house teriyaki is perfect. What I love and get almost every time is the obento rice box, a sampling of three of their most popular proteins, the pork katsu, gyoza, and chicken teriyaki. Served with rice and a simple veggie salad, it's easily big enough to share with two people. The seaweed salad is also fantastic.   I have yet to try the sushi, but other customers assure me it's the best they've had locally without going to a more expensive sushi bar. Overall, the place is clean, fast, and well worth the visit."}
{"text":"I completely stopped going here because they charge way too much and the portions are extremely small.  If you want sushi you have to ask when the manager is going to be there when there is no hours displayed as to when you can have sushi when you want them.  The sushi makers he hires they don't know how to make every dish they have displayed.  It is either his way or no way.  Now he splits two jalapenos into four to make four Jalapeno Dynamites instead of four whole jalapenos for the Dynamites.  That is how he is making money, splitting items in half or using smaller bistro boxes but you have to be willing to want to pay extra for smaller portions.  They changed the miso soup and put less ingredients and charge mostly for the liquid but new customers will not notice.  I can't believe he's greedy and not charging for quality food."}
{"text":"Small, clean place.  Prices a little higher than expected for sushi in this area, but not bad.  Only disappointment was the fish quality.   Tuna and whitefish were heavily marbled and a tad stringy, not sashimi quality."}
{"text":"Yelp seriously needs to have half of a star option!!! But anyways, when I first walked in, the restaurant seem a bit small but it was cozy.    I was in the mood for some sushi after reading their sign saying that it was happy hour for all kinds of sushi for Saturdays and Sundays.  However, when I asked the cashier what were the happy hour deals, what she was telling me...I could not understand a thing she was saying.  All I understood was happy hour is only available if you spend more than $30 on sushi.  So, when I asked my friends who have been there already, they told me there is no such thing as happy hour at Japan Express.  I was glad I did not get sushi or else I would've been BROKE!!  Anyways, I had ordered the Sukiyaki Beef.  It was very bang for the buck! But then I wished I had order the Curry one."}
{"text":"Food is really good so I'll keep coming back, but let me say, I eat here 2-4 times a week.. today I asked for lemon, and I may as well have asked them to murder a kitten.. he told me that they don't give out lemon slices but that he would I've me one. I'm talking about 1/8th of a lemon if anything. Get it together .. specially when u see me here as much as you do."}
{"text":"It's the perfect example of a hole in the wall restaurant. The location is small, but the food was amazing. We had a variety of sushi, all of it amazing, and the teriyaki chicken was the best I've ever had. The prices were great and service was very friendly. I'll be going back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Best Teriyaki chicken in town! My family and i have been eating here for years and have never had a bad meal. Would kill for their Teriyaki sauce recipe! !!"}
{"text":"Quick review.. The food is great. That's all. You can order for pick up over the phone or online. Service is great. Not very big inside. It serves mostly locals.  Now I just want to preface that I do not blame them for what happened, but I want to warn people the risks associated with raw/uncooked seafood. Several months back I ate here and got food poisoning. It was almost to the point that I was considering going to the hospital. I'm early in my thirties and in pretty decent shape, so I can guarantee you it was bad. I read all over the news that next week about contaminated salmon(tuna?). Anyway, point is, you are taking a risk by eating sushi.  Japan Express is still my 2nd favorite place for local sushi."}
{"text":"I came here because I wanted some sushi. I arrived and maybe there was 3 other people inside the place, so I figured it wasnt too busy. I placed an order for my family and when I got to my sushi, I was told \"the sushi counter is closed, she's way behind on her orders\". Bummer, but I figured there was a lot of pickups coming for sushi-not. She fixed one order and had no other orders. I sat there and she did nothing as I waited for my other orders. Very disappointed. I come to a sushi place, expecting sushi. BTW, they kept messing up all the orders that night as well. Poor things, they need help."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for the past three years and I love it.  Same faces everytime I go in, which is a plus.  Food is great, from the sushi to the other dishes.  My favorite is the \"Chicken Yakitori\"."}
{"text":"Great chicken & beef dishes.  Great sushi & salads.  Open till 9pm, stop on your way home for dinner.  The place is always busy too.  Thank You"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  My husband and I just tried it for the first time and we were not disappointed!! The sushi was fresh and delicious!  The teriyaki chicken had the perfect flavor, not too sweet.  The katsu pork dish was full of flavor- just right!  It's a small place in a strip mall with only 6 tables, but it was busy.  That being said, the food was ready quickly and the service was great! We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Nice people, so nice to come in from the traffic and hustle and receive a genuine smile. Not like some places where they have been smiling so long that they have sad eyes and teeth grinning. If you want good food and fresh this place is your go too. Nothing fancy, not like the places where you have fancy plates with gold plated fried shrimp. Most of the food I have gotten has come in a Styrofoam package. But it is yummy and hot and.... Just thinking about it makes me want to go. Sushi is good, rice is moist.  Entrees are enough for leftovers."}
{"text":"Delicious spicy teriyaki  chicken  but I just wish they would give you  a little more in the bowl"}
{"text":"Food is awesome! They definitely give you your money's worth compared to other places. Their spicy teriyaki chicken is amazing. Can eat it everyday!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. I assumed it was like Kyoto Bowl, or Samurai Sams. It is a step up. If those places are like McDonalds, this place is like In-n-Out Burger. I ordered our dinner to go, My GF had a teriyaki/ Broccoli Bowl. She said it was good, but had some buyer's remorse once she tasted my Katsu Bowl. That thing was delicious. Lots of different flavors going on we were very impressed.  We had an order of California Rolls. They were freshly made, but came with only wasabi. I expected ginger to be in there so I didn't ask...Bummed to find that when I got home, but I should've asked so...  There was a big ass ant on the counter, but for all I know he jumped off my shirt. He looked lost and out of place. Unconcerned. (So why'd a mention? I dunno)  Great bang for the buck, 2 very filling bowls, and 4 cali rolls for about $16. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Not good. Avoid. After passing by several times, I finally decided to stop in and try their teriyaki bowls. I had a large teriyaki with \"beef.\". If you thought the beef from Taco Bell was nasty, this is just the same. It literally looked like dog meat. The teriyaki was cold and good tasting at all. As soon as i was handed my plate, I did not look forward to eating it at all. Avoid."}
{"text":"This face remind me of a Tokyo Lobby kind of dark dingy a little unfriendly but the food was okay what to expect from a place like this my mine will dish little too salty for me I like the dark chicken though me at little juicier made to Juicy because the bottom of the tray was full of juice probably won't go back"}
{"text":"We find ourselves here most Saturdays for a big bowl of teriyaki chicken with brown rice and all white chicken meat. The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is delicious.  The restroom could use some updating but it's in an older strip mall so sort of expected. They take phone orders as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic little hole in the wall restaurant! It is always slammed around lunch times often with local businesses, office and school employees, so I always call in my order and bring cash. Their debate/credit card machine seems to not work well.  The spicy chicken teriyaki is amazing, they offer two portion sizes and I sometimes order the large so I have lunch for tomorrow. So tasty and many of my co-workers have had some of their other dishes including the sushi and they say its good. I have not heard on person complain about this spot besides it can have a long wait at times."}
{"text":"Always saw it but never really trusted it till just recently, a few friends invited me to try it. It is fresh and delicious!  I've now came here 3 times and always try something new, they have plenty of options from bowls to Sushi and more! It's small but never busy, you can also call in your order for pick up and I believe they deliver for a charge as well.   Their rolls aren't the biggest but they're pricing is very fair. I recommend the spicy tuna roll. They have a few specialty rolls that have been really good as well.   If you're in the area and looking for some good fresh sushi this is your spot, they also have teriyaki bowls that are really good."}
{"text":"All I had here and on order is there spicy teriyaki chicken with brown rice. Tastes good Everytime. What more can you ask for.   Also every once in a whole I order a rahmun soda."}
{"text":"Very nice service, casual and convenient. I would definitely recommend this place for a quick sushi stop."}
{"text":"Basically a Kyoto Bowl with a different name.  Japan Express is a very small teriyaki chicken/rice bowl restaurant.  They also serve some sushi and a few other items.  The main attraction is teriyaki chicken.  Everyone knows the drill...brown rice, all white meat, add veggies, and make it spicy.  Its nothing special or worth going out of your way for.  If you are in the mood for some Kyoto Bowl/Yoshi type food and near by this place will do."}
{"text":"I discovered Japan Express about a year ago and have gone there at least once a week since. They have the best teriyaki chicken bowls around.  If you are in the mood for spicy their spicy teriyaki bowls are killer.  I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"I had a teriyaki chicken bowl with broccoli. The chicken was kind of burnt. The broccoli was good. The rice was decent. The teriyaki sauce was too sweet. Nice people though!"}
{"text":"Best teriyaki chicken. Ever. Period. I've been coming to this place over 10 years and it's never disappointed. I've also tried the sukiyaki beef and another noodle dish and it's always soooo good! Recommend this to everyone I know."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Japan Express!  I am a big fan of their Spicy Teriyaki  and firecracker sushi roll.  We have never been disappointed in service!"}
{"text":"Though I had known about this place for a while, I hesitated to go because of my experiences with the likes of Kyoto Bowl. When I finally got a chance to try it last week it turned out that the food in this place is definitely superior to what you'll get in other Asian fast food establishments. The restaurant is simple, clean, and plain, and is located in one of the many strip malls that line Olive Avenue in Glendale. The food is very tasty, inexpensive, and the waiting time is quite short. This is the place to go if you want good quality rice bowls and sushi and don't want to spend much - especially with sushi, which tends to be expensive in most sushi places."}
{"text":"Went in for take out was greeted promptly.  Ordered several dishes all where very good still very hot when I got home.  Restaurant was busy is always a good sign.  Very reasonable priced."}
{"text":"I always get chicken teriyaki which I think is the best I've ever had. The chicken is not rubbery which alone makes it great. Its cooked perfectly. I wish they're spicy teriyaki had the option to be spicier. We did order eggs rolls that were soaking wet of oil so I do not recommend those."}
{"text":"It was OK. Nothing bad but also nothing amazing. If you're in the neighborhood and just want to get some quick sushi, then this is your place. If you want something fresh and to blow your mind, I'd go somewhere else.  I ended up picking out the avocado in each roll. It was brown and looking not so fresh. But the rest of the roll was alright! Like I said, nothing bad but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"Good food served up quickly at a reasonable price. We had the spicy teriyaki chicken bowl (best I've tasted) , the California rolls (very good) and two egg rolls - all were very tasty. The establishment is clean and without many frills, the staff is friendly and quick. Who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"Seriously best teriyaki bowl I have ever had. I like spicy but I think the spicy teriyaki takes away from the flavor. Their sushi is always fresh and Saturday and Sundaythey have discounted prices. We like to share a large teriyaki bowl and get two rolls. My favorite rolls are the Futomaki and Tokyo."}
{"text":"I am from Hokkaido, Japan, and I have been going to Japan Express for 10+ years.  The food was top notch and very close to what you get in Japan.  In fact, the teriyaki beef may have been the best I've ever had.  However, I am very disappointed to say that the quality of the food has drastically gone down recently.  In an effort to make the dishes healthier, the owners have made the dishes noticeably worse.  What was once moist, flavorful, and delicious is now dry, bland, and forgettable.  I don't think I can go back now since I know how good it was before these changes.  Owners of Japan Express:  Please reconsider!  You know the food is bad now and so do the customers."}
{"text":"I recently had a first father daughter lunch date with my dad and really enjoyed the food here. I loved the half and half teryaki bowl the lady suggested and omg the shrimp ebi was so yummy. I can't stop craving this place now and can't wait to try more of the menu items. I will absolutely be eating here as much as I can."}
{"text":"Welcome to Shill-ville AZ, population at least 2. Within our borders, service lacks any cordiality. Humidity and temperature within the walls are sweaty hog blistering in the month of January. Food takes a little too long for it to be called \"Express\" and takes even longer to eat it. Why? Because the cuts of meat are akin to those of urban legends more along the lines of Snopes. The only flavorings are eclectically listed on my palate as soy sauce and sugar. When asked for some Sriracha sauce the owner gives thee a look as if asked for pickled human placenta. Let this be a dire message to anyone looking for a true review... would you eat at a place that tries to imitate Yoshinoya?"}
{"text":"Fast, delicious and reasonably priced. Staff is always friendly! Love the Tootsie rolls!"}
{"text":"The spicy teriyaki chicken was amazing. Unfortunately they were out of crab cakes when I went."}
{"text":"I went here due to other good reviews. I have to say I was quite disappointed. I had the teriyaki chicken with brown rice and an ice tea. The chicken was extremely dry even some parts were crispy. They had plenty of sauce but it was really sweet. I usually like to have gamashio (sp?) which is blackened sesame seeds and flaky salt.  But this place didn't have any. Maybe they put a lot of sauce to cover the dryness? The ice tea was very strongly brewed and had an off taste to it. Perhaps it was a little old and I ended up throwing it away.   I was there when the lunch crowd started coming in. Seem to be fairly popular but I don't see why. The sushi that came out seemed to look good. Although I didn't have any. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's an okay restaurant. I don't really have any complaints but nothing really stands out. It's just okay. If I lived near it I might go again just for convenience. The price and what you get are just normal. If I had to, I would relate it to Panda Express of which I'm not a huge fan of because it's just kinda average. I'm not a huge fan of average."}
{"text":"Eel roll was ok, not enough flavors for me but the daughter wanted to try eel. Arizona rolls were perfect! Fried right & fresh ingredients. My son had the Yakisoba chicken bowl. It was a big serving & tasted good. Place is small but comfortable w/tv playing. Staff were nice & patient. This place was recommended by friends from church & I see why. Lots to chose from for such a small place. Price is not bad."}
{"text":"I love their spicy teriyaki bowl. They've upped their menu to include more sushi options, which I think is great. I don't eat sushi, but the people I've brought here who do, really enjoy it. I do appreciate that they included a chicken roll, different veg rolls... Like I said, I don't eat sushi, chickens my game, so yeah I'm definitely ordering this next tyme! I think they have happy hour specials, I'm not sure, don't quote me on that, but the menu is relatively priced so you should be OK."}
{"text":"Hands down...Japan Express is amazing!!! The chicken teriyaki bowl is to die for....blows any other bowls at other fast food chains out of the water! The teriyaki sauce is just so perfect and the chicken is tender and yummy. The rice is ALWAYS cooked perfectly.  If you like sushi....it is always so fresh and made right to order! I would highly recommend the Salmon Philadelphia Roll. It is amazing!!! Check out my picture I posted.....it is a work of art!!! You will not be disappointed trying Japan Express....there is something yummy for everyone!"}
{"text":"Great for take out only. There place is too small for a sour down restaurant.  Their spicy tuna sucked."}
{"text":"So happy! Efficient, friendly, delicious food. Clear menu, pictures on counter, fair pricing, varied Japanese fast food selection. I ordered Tonkatsu and a side of curry today, it truly brought me back to a moment in time of bentos from working in Tokyo/Yokohama. I will make an effort to go here more often. I love a place with a lot of heart! Dark blue themed coloring and is on point. Update; last visit meal was great except side order of gyoza.  Burned. Brownest gyoza I'd seen. Nah."}
{"text":"Don't let the looks of this place deceive you.  Fast service and good food is what you'll find at this tucked-away gem in Glendale."}
{"text":"I found this place in the  early 90's when I worked at a dealership in Glendale. This place has the best teriyaki (all white meat) chicken bowls in the valley so far. I would love to go there more often but its a little out of the way. I love the veggie rolls and edamame. They also have sushi which I have not tried. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I drove back on the 101 after getting my car serviced in Peoria and took Olive so I would pass this place. The extra star is for being FAST. No wait, maybe it's for their staff being sweet and polite. A teenage girl was working the counter and I got the mom n' pop feeling.  If Korean beef rattles your saber, then stop here for sure.  $5.95 for a huge serving with rice. It's not quite authentic bulgogi, but it is very close. The affordable and freshly made veggie roll was tiiiight.  \"Oh man, getting diabetes has never been so delicious\" made me laugh out loud in my open office and I had to explain why. Thanks you, Christopher G."}
{"text":"I love this place. Although it's small & not very noticeable where it's located, it has the best teriyaki chicken... EVER. Also, their rice is delicious with the teriyaki sauce & hot sauce."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best... customer service sucks here too. Sushi was weak and also charged extra for a little teriyaki sauce which should have come with my order  after spending $20 anyway.. will not be returning. There's much better places to get teriyaki and sushi."}
{"text":"My sister and I were in Glendale to visit Cerreta Chocolate Company. We wanted a quick and healthy lunch and googled for sushi place in the area. We had a small teriyaki bowl, a small spicy teriyaki (very spicy), a vegetarian sushi roll, and a miso soup enough to feed 4 people. Prices are good.  Service was excellent! We had a great time visiting Arizona."}
{"text":"I love Japan Express for the large #1 teriyaki chicken on brown rice. I shake on the toasted sesame seeds, some siracha and some chili seasoning. There is a pitcher if purified water to that is always nice too. Police and Fire eat there often."}
{"text":"Japan express has the best teriyaki bowl and rice! Also the sushi is fresh and made to order. The employees are always very friendly and helpful! I love japan express!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a quick bite while at work. The staff is always friendly and the food is fresh. The chicken isn't fatty either which makes the bowls taste delicious. The sauce is a little bit sweeter than most places but none the less still good."}
{"text":"The restaurant smells like sewage. I love the smell of fresh fish and sushi. This smells disgusting for a sushi place."}
{"text":"Great affordability. Great tasting . Simple and delightful . I got chicken teriyaki and the quality of chicken was very good ."}
{"text":"Good food ,fast service and great pricing.I come here quiet often for lunch ,try it out.You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Don't buy the sushi here. That's all, you'll thank me later. I bought the arizona and the Las vegas roll. 6 pieces each - for 18.50?. The flavor is bland. The portion and size is the smallest of sushi I have ever eaten.   There's no eel sauce on their sauces on the side.   Literally 18 dollars for 12 pieces of sushi? I will never come back here.   Had to drive through McDonald's to satisfy our stomach. Can't believe I went here for a sushi. Probably the worst sushi I ever tasted, as the other person with me said \"frys cold sushi is better than this\".  Please stay away if you want sushi..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I've been coming here for years and their quality never changes.  I usually get the Teriyaki bowl or the Vegas rolls."}
{"text":"It's pretty tasty Japanese fast food.  I've had their sushi a few times and the fish isn't top quality but you're not paying top dollar.  I think it's definitely worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here, although, I usually get the same thing; veggie bowl.  The veggies are cooked perfectly and the sauce is addicting.  They are a popular lunch takeout spot so plan to arrive a little before or after the typical lunch rush if you have a problem with a little waiting.  Otherwise, the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. Never a bad experience. Great food and the staff is really sweet. I would recommend this place to everyone who loves sushi. Most try!!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi one of my favorite places to eat totally recommend it was one of the first sushi places I've tried and I absolutely loved it !!!!!! They have other stuff on the menu as well they have a variety of options and I will continue to go there."}
{"text":"Spicy teriyaki chicken pretty darned good with a nice kick of heat.. No major frills just really good bowl..."}
{"text":"Ok so after reading the other review that said a lot of cops eat here I was thinking, \"how many is a lot\"? Well when I arrived I saw several police motorcycles out side and when I walked in there was 6 officers sitting at a table. :) it made me laugh in side. Teriyaki bowls must be the new donuts.   So I walked pass the cops and up to the little counter and the thing that struck me was, \"this place is small and almost out of place\" It's Awesome. Just a few tables and a long wall table with several chairs at it. I got to the counter, I played it safe and ordered the LG chicken teriyaki bowl and a small drink $7.50. The white girl at the counter was a little confused when I asked if they had Sunumono salad :( she looked at me kind of funny and then the Asian man next to her said it had not been made yet. So i stuck with the rice bowl.   They took my name, I filled my cup and took a seat at the long wall table since I was alone (leave the tables for groups). They called my name and I walked over and grabbed my food. The teriyaki bowl was good. The rice was cooked just rite and the sauce was sweet. The sauce was a little thinner than I like but the flavor was good.   The is a cool little place and I will be back again soon to try something out side of my comfort zone. :)"}
{"text":"Horrible service.   25 minutes waiting on 2 rolls of sushi and a regular size chicken terryayaki. At 1130 am.  Cashier is nice. Not the plus size sushi maker.  She is not friendly and when asked for chop sticks she just said the were out.  She was lazy to go get refills from the back.  Chicken was ok. A little dry. No terryayaki sauce. You have to purchase it separately.  The rolls were good. Not tightly rolled."}
{"text":"Quite a long wait for my food, but other than that the food was super good and the staff was excellent. Price was fair environment was chill just how i like it!"}
{"text":"I chose to try this place out after a friend told me it was really good! I gave it a try and to my surprise it was very tasty :) however, I'm a huge sushi fan and along with my order I tried one of the many crunch rolls.. They're smaller than your average sushi rolls.. But the chicken teriyaki bowl is to die for !! Must try along with some crab puffs  :)"}
{"text":"Wow, that was nasty. It's like they don't even care. I got the steak and beef teriyaki bowl. The steak looks like they just chopped up some steakum's and some pieces of the chicken looked like they were from the night before, almost like jerky. Damn , pictures looks so good. Very unfortunate."}
{"text":"Ordered the teriyaki chicken skewers and salmon rolls. The skewers lacked in flavor and the rolls were super tiny. The salmon wasn't even that fresh and the wasabi was weak. Not coming back"}
{"text":"The food is REALLY good here.  I've tried a couple of their sushi options (they have a fantastic selection) as well as teriyaki chicken (regular and spicy) and chicken kebabs.  They were all amazing!  Also, nice quantity and very reasonable prices.  There are few places my entire family can agree on, and this is one !  I feel lucky to have them within a few blocks of our home.  One minor exception to my overall glowing review:  I recommend ordering in person as opposed to on-line.  The one time we ordered on-line, there were multiple errors in the order."}
{"text":"Love Japan Express - I get dinner there every week for my family. The teriyaki beef is excellent & the baked salmon sushi roll.. I'm addicted!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food tasted great.  It was our first time there,  the guy took his time walking us through the menu.  Will update review even I go back."}
{"text":"I just ordered through postmates.  The gyoza bento box did not come with rice, salad, or anything.  The miso soup definitely does not have mushrooms.  And finally, the 7pc sashimi was only 1 kind of fish, not the two i asked for.    All in all, the food was really good!  Everything was absolutely delicious!  Unfortunately, the order was incorrect or incorrectly advertised."}
{"text":"Ordered an $8 plate beef and onion beef was described as thin sliced what I got was an old plate of soggy onion and steamed beef that was not thinly sliced it looked very old. I tried it and it tasted awful so I politely asked if I could change my dish to something different and the girl working there said I could not because they already made the food I told him not to worry about it and walked out and left"}
{"text":"This place is right next to a Fry's grocer we go to on a weekly basis and since my usual choice of sushi is normally no better than a supermarket my hubby and I thought we'd try it out because it was 1) close by and 2) had sushi plus other meal choices. I'm the sushi fan and my hubby is not too much. I got a dragon sushi roll which was very tasty and spicy which came with plenty of wasabi and ginger. It's definitely a step above what I've eaten at a grocery store (not like that's a good compare, haha) but I'm not an expert. Nevertheless, I was pleased with it.  I also ordered a small spicy chicken teriyaki because so many people on yelp seem to love it. It's not super spicy but flavorful, wish there were more sauce so perhaps I'll get some extra next time. The chicken had some charring but for me this wasn't bad...I like the smoky flavor and it was not overcooked.The small size was a lot to eat and filled me up even before I had any sushi.  My hubby ordered the large Oyakodon bowl which had diced chicken topped with egg(simlar to egg foo young), green onion and napa cabbage over rice. It was definitely a different dish for him but he thought it was pretty good. It was a huge portion which he only got half way through. The price was pretty decent for the size and taste in my opinion. We did wait about 15-20 minutes for our order, part of the reason was because they messed it up and had to redo one of the dishes. Will definitely try them out again because they have a wide variety of sushi and other dishes."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is attentive and friendly, the service is fast, the food is great and also a great value.  I recommend the spicy teriyaki but have them add green onions. The sushi here is also good and I recommend the spring roll sushi roll on a hot day."}
{"text":"This place has really good spicy teriyaki chicken when it's on point the best there is. Only reason for not having 5 stars is that one they large is no longer as big as it once was.  And sometimes the chicken has too much fat or too little sauce."}
{"text":"I've loved this place for years. The spicy teriyaki chicken with steamed veggies is so delicious and I'm also a huge fan of the sushi. Ingredients are always fresh and I've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's not express, E.G., Yen Sushi has gotten us sushi faster, better, in less time.  Not a fan of eating at a place for speed reasons and finding out after  we could have made a regular location in the same or less time.  It's not  as cheap as people are making out.  Especially when we left the tuna roll for  not \"being up to high snobby Scottsdale standards\"  seriously the only place we've had that concern in many years.  The entrées were much better and if we hadn't had any sushi I could see this place being  three  stars but  I'm not seeing the 4's and 5's for this place as a whole."}
{"text":"This place has been nothing but good to me since the day I was introduced to it close to 5yrs ago!  They have upgraded a few things and made some changes during that time but one thing that has always remained is the great quality of service and of food! I'm very pleased with this establishment and would definitely recommend them to anyone and everyone!!!  Don't pass up on this spot!"}
{"text":"Best terriaki in hands down been going there for over ten years bulgogi is really good there sushi is good but only the Cali rolls and there hot sushi"}
{"text":"I always get California rolls. Last time I went I tried the tempura shrimp. It was delicious.  I've been here a few times since 2012. The restaurant has really upgraded.  They even started taking online orders.  I haven't tried the system yet."}
{"text":"I met some friends for dinner at the Shishkebab House next door. However, nothing looked good on their menu, so I got some takeout from Japan Express and brought it back next door. My thanks to the Shishkebab House for not giving me any attitude about this. Later my friends would tell me I won for best dinner.  I'll let them comment on their dining experience elsewhere.  I got a mix of (non-raw) sushi from Japan Express, and all of it was tasty and fresh. Tamago (egg) wasn't on the menu but I asked the chef to make it, and it was gooood. Unagi was soft and went down easily, as it should, and the avocado roll was equally delish.  JE is located in an outdoor strip mall, something you'd just pass right by if you didn't have specific occasion to visit. However, lots of people make it a specific occasion to visit, because the place was packed, and people kept coming in. They do a LOT of takeaway business.  IIRC, they are not open Sundays."}
{"text":"Love the spicy teriyaki chicken bowl . I have lunch there whenever I'm in the area. Definitely worth it to me."}
{"text":"This used to me one of my favorite places! However, now their portions are 1/3 of the previous size and same (if not higher) cost. The taste and quality has also declined. I'm SO disappointed and won't be going here any longer."}
{"text":"The best Chicken Teriyaki I've had in the valley, and their Sushi is made fresh & is amazing. I highly recommend this place, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Japan Express is a surprisingly refreshing assortment of asian food for the valley. For people who are used to the typical chinese or sushi restaurant this is a great alternative when you want to branch out.   They have a really good selection of food on the menu that comes out pretty fast. There menu is more than just Japanese but includes eclectic dishes you'd see at chinese places, korean, and even some indian.   Great prices too, can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"I love the sushi here but the other food i would pass on. The staff is very nice. The restaurant is pretty small maybe about 6 tables but clean."}
{"text":"I love everything they serve at Japan Express.  One large chicken teriyaki and a roll of sushi can feed my family of 5.  Chris, the owner is super cool, and always lets my kids watch him make our rolls.  I can not say enough great things about this place.  I highly recommend to anyone who wants inexpensive but not lacking on quality or taste. My children want them to bottle up the teriyaki sauce so we can have it at home."}
{"text":"When my bf brings up Tokyo Express or Panda Express I would rather make myself a sandwich. Im just not a fan of \"fast japanese food\". He took me to Japan Express and I actually liked it. It was clean. The man & woman behind the counter were friendly. we both ordered a regular size teriyaki bowl for $6 each. (the food was more than enough for me) The chicken was tasty, so were the veggies in the bowl. We also ordered a rainbow and philly sushi roll. The philly roll was made a little different but I loved it like that. Both were very good"}
{"text":"First time I ordered it was amazing and I had a ton left over, it was so good that two days later I ordered again, but the second time my chicken was dry and my teriyaki chicken was burned and dry and didn't have enough teriyaki sauce. Also they forgot to give teriyaki sauce when I wrote in the notes I wanted extra. Which sucked so at this point it's kind of hit or miss. It's good food but I just expected my future experience to be exactly like my first."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. I am very picky and I had read the Yelp reviews of others before trying out this place. I got the eel bowl which consists of eel slices with a delicate sauce over rice. I chose brown rice. My husband got the chicken teriyaki. He was very pleased with it. We will definitely be going back. There are a number of items on the menu that I am looking forward to getting. The food was prepared perfectly. The atmosphere was comfortable and the service was nice."}
{"text":"Delicious Yakisoba can be found here, the terriyaki chicken bowl is delicious. The Ben-To Box is the best I have had so far. I will keep returning here because he food is delicious."}
{"text":"Big middle finger goes out to Panda right now, Japan is my new \"Express\" for a quick Asian food fix. You should already know better than to get sushi from these types of places, so if you insist, just get something deep fried and smothered in eel sauce. Yes, it's an abomination to real sushi, but it's pretty darn tasty.  The bowls here are cheap, and come out so fast you just KNOW it wasn't made fresh. The spicy terriyaki chicken bowl was so scrumptious that I didn't care. And for a total of around $7, I inhaled it, washed down with a bottle of Ramune soda. Delicious."}
{"text":"I constantly find myself here ordering the spicy Teriyaki chicken bowl. It's amazing. Best Teriyaki I've had, I love how spicy they make it. Good price too."}
{"text":"I had the spicy teriyaki chicken, which was pretty good for those that aren't in to sushi. My lady had California rolls and spicy tuna rolls. She liked those quite a bit. The service was quick as well. I put my order in by phone and arrived within about 10-15 minutes to my order already being completed."}
{"text":"Not sure how I feel about this place, it's understood that it's Japanese fast food but regardless not the best Japanese fast food I've had.  Came here for lunch and got the Eel bowl and the Tonkotsu Meal.   Eel bowl, lacked just that the eel! Skimpy tiny pieces, unagi sauce a bit too salty. It's a simple meal but with thicker slices and holding back on the salt the bowl would've been perfect. The Tonkotsu Meal came with Tonkotsu, Rice, Miso Soup and a small salad mix. The Tonkotsu was pounded thinly, meat looked a bit too grey for comfort, batter not crisp, nor crunchy from panko breading that I'm accustomed too. Though you do get a big portion for the price you pay ($8) I'd rather head to a Hawaiian Fast Food place to get Tonkotsu. Ideally, I wanted to come here for sushi but the sushi chef wasn't in ... bummer.  Service is typical for a fast food joint, order at the register and eat at any of the tables. Interior is clean and water, utensils, napkins and sauces readily available."}
{"text":"For the sushi only.  It didn't make me sick, but it didn't taste good at all.  And for such expensive prices not only would I expect good sushi,  I'd expect it not to come on all Styrofoam plates."}
{"text":"I've lived in AZ for almost 2 years now. Moving here from the Bay Area it has been very difficult to find some very good Japanese spots that serve more than the traditional expected \"sushi, teriyaki dishes, etc\". I've been eyeballing this spot for a couple weeks now bcuz on their menu was Katsu Bowl. Most places around here Katsu Bowl is just the traditional Katsu, but at Japan Express it showed a dish that is properly known as Katsu DonBuri. Traditionally it's made with pork cutlet. Here it's made with chicken, but one thing I have to say is that they execute it very well."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite fast food Japanese joint. Their teriyaki chicken is amazing and their sushi is pretty good. The sushi isn't the same quality as a sushi restaurant but it fills the craving. The prices are good and the service is quick. It's a pretty small place so I usually just get it to go but I will always be a regular here! Bottom line if you love teriyaki chicken definitely give Japan Express a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place, Japan Express. After spending three years in Alaska while in the military, I developed quite a fancy for salmon. Thus, I ordered the Teriyaki Salmon. I was pleasingly blown away. The salmon came wrapped in aluminum foil with two little bowls of teriyaki sauce. The salmon was very flakey and cooked to perfection. It was served with a generous amount of white sticky rice and a small but very deliciously sweet green salad dressing poured over the cucumbers and carrots. The salmon filet is at least eight ounces, if not more. For $9.99, you will not be disappointed but you will be delightfully full. I highly recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love Japan Express! You can't go wrong with their quick and fresh take out. Not bad for dine in either. Their dragon rolls and firecracker rolls are amazing! Their beef sukiyaki and teriyaki chicken is very good too. I hope this place stays around forever cuz there are none like it around anymore."}
{"text":"Good food for the price! The place is a little crowded & hot. Fast food, cheap & delicious. It is great for take out."}
{"text":"The sushi here is pretty good. Some rolls are better than others. It's great for the happy hour prices they offer.   It is really really small inside of here. They only offer maybe 6 tables? 4 people max for 1 table. But they have kind of like a bar table along on of the walls. My coworkers and I ordered some sushi to go because there were no seats left. There was barely any standing room for us to wait without getting in people's way.   The tuna in the roll that I ordered tasted fresh. All the flavors were there and really hit the spot for me."}
{"text":"Have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered.   Only place worth its Dollars since New York Wok sold to new management that cannot cook there way out of a bag in a fryer"}
{"text":"Food is still delicious ever since they changed to go bowls or plates whatever you shall call it protein Che/stk servings are smaller they claim it haven't changed it's bull it has I ordered to large chicken bowls both paid for extra chicken I mentioned before leaving one has a smaller amount. They disagreed I came home and my son and measure it out we went the extra mile to figure this out since this has been a on going issue. At least 4 -  6 times.  We were right, one bowl had way less meat than thee other. Sad stuff, now owner is honoring a free large extra chk bowl I will give one more chance not to burn me next time I'm not returning here agian it's not cheap when you feed a family here as it is.  35-45.00 every visit"}
{"text":"Solid Dynamite Roll. The Goyza was overcooked and too crunchy. The customer service was good. Pretty decent prices.  I'll be back for lunch!"}
{"text":"order on line...ready when you get there. big portions...great food. large menu. treat yourself! This is a gem tucked away in strip mall...but worth hunting it down. Best rainbow roll in the valley. They have happy hour prices...go on line and check it out! http://japanexpressaz.com/"}
{"text":"The food is not bad but the place is very unappealing on the inside and the owner has little to no sense about customer service. When you walk in you can tell that the decor was just slapped on around the place to give you a hint that it is a Japanese place but that about it. If I brought any of my Japanese friends to this place they would say it's ghetto and not up to the Japanese standard of hospitality. The owner is always there every time I go but he just hides behind the little sushi station and barks out orders to his employees. Oh and don't be surprised if he is talking on the phone the entire time where everyone can see. Nor should you expect him to in the least to say \"hello welcome,\" and if no one else is behind the counter he'll just go on about his business as if you're not there waiting for service. You'll have to wait for his employee to come back from their break. I will just have to take my business to some other place."}
{"text":"The sushi is mediocre, the first time I got salmon sashimi it was frozen in the middle, and the second time the salmon wasn't fresh. The texture was softer and chewer than the norm. The rolls with the salmon doesn't taste too well bc it's has the same texture as the rice which lead me to think I was just chewing on rice the whole time. Other than the food, the service is really good."}
{"text":"Probalby the best teriyaki chicken I've had in the Glendale area.  But that's not saying much.  Flavorful, not a bad price, but it needs more sauce.  The spicy chicken is pretty damn good.  The buidling is small and I've only gotten it to go, but it is tasty."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best Teriyaki in the Valley. Big serving size, awesome rice, good chicken, perfect sauce. I've hunted for Teriyaki like this for years. Must try!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband are always looking for good Sushi. I was glad I checked Yelp for this location. The Sushi was good but so was everything else we ordered. The Teriyaki Chicken, Tonkatsu (pork cutlet), and Gyoza (pot stickers) were incredible. We have been and will continue to go back to Japan Express. YUM!"}
{"text":"I had a roller-coaster experience at Japan Express. We called our order in for pick up, I was told 15 minutes....not a problem. When we got there to pick up our food we still waited 10 additional minutes (down). The sushi chef said my salmon roll was fresh so it may still be pretty cold (up).   Once home I opened up my katsu bowl and it was amazing (way up), my son loved his teriyaki chicken and my daughter loved her obento (getting higher). Until she found a wire in it (down, way down). The wire was breading into the pork...good thing she was paying attention to what she was eating, who knows what that wire would have caused.   I did call, to let them know what we found...the lady who answered the phone said she thought she knew what it was but she had no idea how it got into the food. She said it was probably a wire from the brillo pad-disgusting. She did offer me a credit for the price on the obento next time we go.   I understand that things like this are not the norm, or so I hope. The remaining of the food was really good. I will update when we go back for our credit."}
{"text":"Despite going through several different owners in the last 10 or so years the recipes have stayed consistent as has most of the friendly and helpful staff.  The new owner's added sushi which is made to order, is fresh, and very tasty.  I usually go for the spicy white meat chicken teriyaki bowl, spicy with brown rice. Their version of spicy is spicy so order with caution.  The chicken is moist and tender, with a nice smoky teriyaki flavor.  Brown rice is fluffy and moist for a brown rice, white rice is sticky with the proper texture that absorbs soy or other sauces.   Others I have gone to eat with have ordered a variety of items, and I have never heard a complaint other than the inability to finish the meal.  As stated before the seating area is small, they do a lot of take out business and if you need to talk to a member of the Glendale or Phoenix police or fire you will probably find someone from those departments eating there."}
{"text":"Small little place with a couple tables and seating along the wall with televisions. I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl and the chicken was really good. The rice on the other hand had a slightly off taste, but not nasty or anything. Will probably be back."}
{"text":"I love this place, they have great customer service,food comes out fast and everything is delicious. My favorite is the spicy tuna roll and philly."}
{"text":"Today I got a craving for Sushi... Because I tried them the other day I decided to go to Japan Express... I took the 15 minute drive (nothing else to do on the way or even nearby - ONLY went to get their Sushi) with salivating anticipation the entire drive. I go inside and start my order at which time the girl at the counter says, \"Oh! I'm sorry - we don't have Sushi today.\" ARE YOU FRIGGIN KIDDING ME?!!? Sushi is more than 50% of your menu! Your window is PLASTERED with pictures of, yup, you guessed it - SUSHI. And you randomly \"don't have any today\"? I asked when there IS Sushi & she told me \"it varies\". HUH? Well guess what - since you randomly have your menu options available AND made me waste both time & money in gas to play sushi roulette - I take back my glowing review - and I won't be coming back to gamble with you ever again. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Japan Express is a little hole-in-the wall fast casual dining experience you are going to fall in love with!  The store front is unassuming and approachable.  You simply walk up to the counter and order.  They are always happy to answer any questions or concerns.  My husband had the bulgogi dish and it was so moist and packed full of authentic flavor.  I had eel on a bed of rice.  Even the rice was really moist and savory.  We shared some miso, edamame and a rainbow roll of sushi and all were just delicious.  Be warned though, this is a small restaurant, not suited for large parties and is FAST CASUAL, not casual.  They will bring your meal to table for you, but only after you walk up and place your order."}
{"text":"Prices were comparable to a lot of other Japanese \"fast food\" places in the Valley. Sushi was good. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Tempura shrimp small, veggies cut to thick & batter gooy. Sushi poorly rolled so fell apart, and futomaki (big roll) was the smallest roll. Won't be returning."}
