{"text":"So disappointed. Terrible tasting food and way overpriced. Just so many good Indian restaurants in the area, I simply will not eat here again."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant and an absolute gem of it! I walked in with my parents to celebrate their anniversary and we were not disappointed. The food is unique, flavourful, high-quality and authentic! Despite being a new restaurant, the service was superb and attentive. A very welcoming environment and the servers and managers came to check in several times. We felt totally at home! 

As for the food, where can I begin?? The dum mutton biryani was bursting with flavours. Very well cooked, the meat was tender and the creative presentation of it was a nice touch. The butter chicken and mixed veggie in their special sauce was delish. The lamb chops were falling off the bones but the portions were a little small. Regardless, it was packed with flavour. My parents loved the masala papad and have been talking about it to this date.  We also had the masala chai which was good but were too full from the food to order dessert. Next time, we will definitely try their cute desserts served in clay pots."}
{"text":"Portions are ridiculously small for the price. the butter chicken was burnt, the Goan fish was tough and inedible. the dal paneer was the only shining spot in my order. I won't go back - I'm so disappointed. quality and quantity + price are not in line. this restaurant will have a difficult time because there are many good Indian restaurants in Midtown and Leaside and with this poor quality and poor value, they will have a tough time staying afloat."}
{"text":"The first time I had heard of Khau Gully was through a BlogTO clip on Facebook where they hyped it up to oblivion, like they do with most \"new\" things in town.  

With plenty of south asian cuisine experience, I give the food a 4. Oh it tasted nothing like the karahi gosht you had in North India on your trip? Well... no two curries taste the same. South Asian cuisine is versatile, and there are MANY versions and adaptations to the tikka masalas and butter chickens we know and love. Khau Gully's broad menu targets mainstream Toronto, while serving up delicious and balanced curries in a very inviting, and cozy space. 

Typically I don't expect ambience walking into an Indian restaurant, and I try to get in an out quickly. But Khau Gully has put substantial effort into their space. The mural on the wall brilliant! The detail and intricacies in the artwork embodies the Indian culture beautifully. 

FOOD: I tried the Chicken Dum Biryani, which is cooked in a clay pot, with a dough cover. I asked for it to be medium spicy, and I think it was bang on. The Chicken Tikka Masala was also very good! Sometimes I find tikka masalas to be too sweet, but this one was just right. Also a couple of naans on the side and some raita - it was a delicious meal.
By the way - the menu is full of vegetarian and vegan options!
(Another reviewer mentioned grittiness... it's the style of the curry. Some people blend the spices really fine, and some do it partially. I personally prefer the latter. )

SERVICE: Better than any Indian restaurants I've been to, but not as great as your auntie's house. Although they did come and check on us 12 times to make sure everything was good. ;) They were well staffed, and everyone was very attentive and polite!

For two people, $42 for dinner near Yonge and Eglinton... it's definitely fair. We were full, and even had some leftovers. 

Disclaimer: This is not your take out Indian joint... the portions are not huge, but they are fair! The prices may not be cheap, but they are definitely reasonable for the quality and location. The Indian restaurant business may seem saturated, but there's always something lacking (usually service). 

It's not perfect... but in my opinion Khau Gully strives to fulfill every major criteria on the list to be a solid Indian joint for the mainstream market."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner here! Fantastic service, such kind staff. Loved how they are paperless and use iPads for sending orders to the kitchen. Great food and good flavours, won't sit in your stomach. Loved the naan and roti. Would go back"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing dinner at the new restaurant across the street. The food was exceptional...every dish was flavourful, beautifully presented and perfectly cooked. The Iranian chicken kebobs were incredible-by far the most tender chicken I have ever tasted!! For a newly launched restaurant, the chefs, wait staff and owner are off to a great start!  It was a pleasure chatting with Abhishek (owner) and learning about his inspiration for the restaurant and passion for authentic Indian cuisine in mid-town Toronto. A wonderful atmosphere...a great addition to the neighbourhood!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"The fried okra is a fantastic snack! However the prices are a tad too high. Lower them a bit and see this place explode."}
{"text":"Went there last week, and this place does Rock.  Never have I had a Chicken Curry wrapped up in an egg omelette, in a rich gravy.   The deserts were just dreamy and the texture of the Khulfi left your mouth totally dancing a new tune.   A must place to visit and try their Khulfi for sure."}
{"text":"I got delivery for two after looking at their delicious-sounding menu. Unfortunately neither of us enjoyed most of what we ate, and we were ultimately mad at the high price for the small portions of the overall average food.

The good:
- The gajar ka halwa ($5.50), a sweet carrot dessert, was pretty good. Standard portion size for a dessert.
- Mango lassi ($5) was okay. Not spectacular, but not bad. Standard portion size.

The iffy:
- Subz cheesy kurkure ($10.90), 4 medium-sized fried patties of cheese and veggies: Flavor: Too spicy for me, but otherwise tasty. Portion: I know it's \"just\" an appetizer, but there wasn't much here at all for how much it cost.
- Kofta Shaam Savera ($14.55), small bowl of tomato gravy with cheese-filled spinach dumplings: Flavor: Too spicy for me, but not bad. Portion: REALLY small. Just... disappointingly little food. There was almost more food in the kurkure appetizer.

The bad:
- Steamed basmati rice ($3.50): Dry as heck.
- Assorted indian bread basket ($8.50): Nothing stood out here. The plain naan was probably the best part, as it was chewy and soft. The other breads were tough, dry-ish, and didn't have the best flavors.

CONCLUSION: Too expensive for too little food. Most of the food wasn't great, and some of the food was too spicy with no indication on the menu of how hot it would be. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"3.5 stars but I am rounding down because I can't justify giving this place 4 stars.

When I walked into this restaurant, I was immediately enamoured by the beautiful d√©cor. We made a reservation for nine people and I loved the setup of the long table that we were assigned--so much so that I had to take a picture of it before I took my seat. Also, I noticed that the restaurant had a strong smoky smell; thankfully, it was a beautiful day outside so the doors of the restaurant were open to air out the smoke. 

The waiter was kind enough to explain the menu for us as it was our first time at this restaurant. We decided in the end to order and communally share all the dishes--which I highly recommend, even if you don't normally share you food with other people, DO IT, trust me, you won't regret it!! Also, the restaurant is willing to split the bill for you so it was easy for us to pay separately. 

When placing our order, the waiter was pretty pushy about wanting us to order the kabobs. We told him \"no\" but he kept insisting us to order. In the end, we did order it because we became a party of ten people. However, for $17.95 for 8 pieces is a bit steep. If only the overall service was as attentive as the waiter's pushiness for us to order the kabob, we wouldn't need to be waving throughout our meal to get our waters refilled. Nonetheless, I did like that we had our plates changed between our starters and mains. 

We had the mango chicken salad, which was alright, nothing special. We also had an assort of curries dishes that we ordered, each had a unique flavour. We especially loved the fish curry as it had an added coconut flavour which helped offset the fishiness taste. We ordered a lot of naan to go with our curry, which was meeeeh, as I love it when restaurants finish their naan with some butter/oil on the top.

When it came time for us to pay, we found that we were charged $2.50 for \"open food.\" When asked what \"open food\" was, we were notified that the charge is for the \"lime\" that we added to our water. We called for the manager to speak with us and he explained that anytime you want extra anything, like \"onions,\" they charge that in the \"open food\" fee. He said the waiter should have explained it to us when we asked for lime--well, the waiter did NOT tell us, probably because he was so busy trying to recommend the kabobs. The manager was kind enough to take the $2.50 charge off our bill.

The aftermath of our indian experience at Khau Gully resulted in some members of our dinner party making a couple trips to be bathroom. I don't know if this is a good sign... 

Would I return? Probably not."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. This place does not even give you complementary papad! How stingy can they get after charging so much? No one cares if your glass of water is empty to refill it. Tried the Chicken Dum Biryani which was excellent and the Gajar Ka Halwa desert which was good. Wanted to actually try the Kersar Malai Firni but they did not have any. Polite staff but needs to improve service."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. We had an 845pm reservation and didn't get our food until 1015pm! It was quite a long wait for 3 dishes, and the staff kept apologizing but we still had to endure the wait. It was even more frustrating as those groups seated after us received their menus, water, and food before us. I'm not sure why we were overlooked. 


Now for the food... it was decent. Good flavours. We got the biryani and chicken tikka masala and naan. It wasn't anything to come back for though, as better and similar options are located at any other Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Yaaaaay, a new, amazing and authentic Indian restaurant in the neighbourhood!

I want to start from the service.. that was great! If you are not Indian or are not with Indian friends, don't worry! They will go over the menu with you and answer all your questions about their huge variety of meals! Staffs are helpful and kind.

Chai is so good, just a little pricy for a little cup, but it comes in a cute clay cup tho! Hahaha

We went in 6 people, then I got to try different dishes and it was nice, all with a good mix of spices.. some dishes were hot and some were mild, then there is dishes for everyone!
My two favourite ones were:
Mug siya mirch - the chicken was so tasty and melting in my mouth.
Dhansak - the daal (with yellow lentils) was sooooo tasty and a bit spicy how I like + the lamb was so tender! Loooooved!

For the desserts we got:
- Gulab Jamun: I'm a gulab jamun lover, then it's complicated for me to talk much about it. I just love, and it was delicious. It comes 2 balls of it.
- Green Pistachio Kulfi: Their Kulfi has a really good quality, but the problem with me is that I prefer the ones that are not too concentrated. Then I didn't like much.
- Gajar Ka halwa: Sooooooo good and the portion is big! It really worth!

HEY, YOU DO NEED TO TRY THEM OUT!"}
{"text":"Look no further for Indian food in midtown. As someone who's eaten their fair share of Indian food over the years, this place is excellent. Everything is fresh prepared with no use of cans as the waiter explained. The flavors are out of this world and if you're vegan this is the place for you. They have over a dozen vegan options on the menu. Very authentic and family owned, this place is top notch."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch--noticed  great graffiti art on the walls and mind blowing aroma in air!!

This place has the most amazing unique items on the menu..one of them is Murgh Patiala--shredded chicken rolled in egg omelet and cooked in thick gravy, you have a choice to have with rice or wheat roti....

Ummmm ahhhhhmazing---the best tasty thing I have had in a long time...

Also for dessert I ordered Gajar Ka Halva---minced carrot dessert deliciousness in full effect..

It is a bit on the pricey side, but worth coming in and trying the unique delicious dishes."}
{"text":"While I was overwhelmed with excitement over the fact that the Davisville area had another Indian restaurant to try out, I was left with a flow of questions that leave me wondering if I'd come back again.

Why such a steep price?
- I understand that the type of ingredients in a majority of Indian cuisine are pretty expensive. Despite that, I don't expect to see less of what I ordered and more side dishes to fill you up instead. I ordered the Lazeez Murg Tikka Masala (Chicken Tikka Masala, if you will) which same in a small bowl with another bowl of basmati rice, salad, and what looked to be chickpea curry. All of this for $16.55.

Why is there 'frozen vegetable medley' in my basmati rice?
- As the dish was laid in front of me, I looked at my basmati rice confused. This was the first time I saw, what I assume to be, frozen vegetables (peas, carrots and corn) in my rice. Didn't really add to the basmati rice. In fact, it looked of lesser value than I would assume it'd be.

Why are there so many different things on my plate?
- I didn't really care for the salad and chickpea curry, if I didn't order it. If that was the reason for the $16.55, I'd rather not have it and pay less.

The Chicken Tikka Masala itself was pretty good regardless. The chicken was cooked gorgeously tender and the aroma of the masala was intoxicating. I do have to point out that my first spoonful of the masala was a bit on the gritty side though... Masala mix that didn't blend well enough? Who knows.

There's a lot of work to be done here at Khau Gully, but with improvements I think it can stand with the rest of the Indian restaurants in the area, because none of them are really good."}
{"text":"Overall experience was good. They had a dj the night i came in and it made my monday feel like a friday.

Environment: cozy and welcoming feel. The murals in the place look pretty good. It seems to have 3 different areas which focus on different settings which is good. 

Service: very helpful and took the time to explain the dishes. They even went in depth to talk about the dishes they was to showcase in Toronto. Traditional with a modern twist.

Food: tbh lots of indian restaurants seem the same, but you can always tell the ones who use quality and i can assure you that Khau Gully tries to offer quality taste and flavour. I recommend the chicken mango salad and the lamb stew.

Price: a little bit pricey but considering the area its actually fairly priced. Will definitely come back with frienda as it has a chilling vibe to it."}
