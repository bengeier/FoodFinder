{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. There's a 300% mark up on everything in the store (for example, a 12 pack of Canada dry is 7.89$). There's no reason to come here,  for anything, ever. There's a CVS a block away, and Amazon Prime delivers to this area."}
{"text":"Great service, great people, and their Deli is delicious. (Boar's Head meat!) Also, beer and wine selection, great convenience downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"Sorry to say after 6 months of shopping hear I will never again shop hear. I was ok with the marked up price, it's convenient.  I enjoyed talks with old man about current events he had playing on the TV . I was excited to hear Boars Head was going to be served in the near future. All great stuff for Downtown Tempe. But tonight Colten made me think why I was spending my money at Milk and Honey. I asked Colten to check and see if he had any more \"Ponderosa IPA\" in the back, I thought it was a reasonable request considering I spend $183 there a month on average (I checked my bank account and did the math). I said casually that I come hear a lot and I would appreciate if he checked for me. Colten dove straight into how he didn't like my \"tone\" and he made it obvious he had a taser in his pocket. I'm not sure but if I owned a neighborhood market I would treat the neighbors a little better,"}
{"text":"The man working threatened to call the police on us because we were sitting outside and I am a black woman and he was scared of us. All we were doing was sitting outside and he came outside and I was disgusted with his accusations. I will never return as this man who was smoking in front of our face threatened to call the police on us."}
{"text":"I love this store. The pricing is based on conveince and the employees are awesome, I would reccomend this spot for anyone looking for groceries, sandwhiches (boars head), or just toiletries."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to stop and grab coffee or a quick bite to eat in Tempe. The people are great and I'll be going here quite a lot"}
{"text":"This place is super convenient and the people who work there are very friendly but they pick and choose their hours on any given day, obviously based on who is working, whether they decide to show up on time, whether they feel like screwing around in the back instead of working, etc.  If you have posted hours, your staff should abide by them."}
