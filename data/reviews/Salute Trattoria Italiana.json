{"text":"Salute replaced the previous Italian restaurant at Red Rock Casino and is definitely an upgrade. The interior is nicely redone, creating a space that feels much more open and welcoming. They even have patio seating now, and an outdoor entrance that allows you to bypass the gross smoke cloud that lingers inside casinos.  For starters the person I was with ordered the chopped salad and I ordered the special of the beet salad. We both found them delicious and almost cleared our plates. For the main entree I ordered their special a la vodka fettuccini which is prepared tableside. What a presentation! Cooked in front of you inside a hollowed out Parmesan wheel, it is an innovative and new table side preparation I had never seen or come across before. Some of the Parmesan wheel melts into the pasta as it cooks giving it great flavor, and the fire gets hot when the vodka is added ;) I choose to add shrimp to the dish instead of the suggested meatballs and was not disappointed. My dining partner had the capellini which was good, but he found to lack a bit in flavor. He added some grated parmesan and red pepper flakes which seemed to suffice, but it isn't great when you have to add things to your food to make it flavorful, which is why it only gets 3 stars. The portions were good size as well, and we both ended up taking home our leftovers.  Lastly, the service was excellent. The wait staff was extremely attentive and helpful with questions about the menu. I especially enjoyed the sense of humor of the gentleman who made the pasta table side who was \"filling in for the authentic Italian guy dressed nicely who normally does this, but everyone has a night off.\" The wait staff gets 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Finally an Italian restaurant with REAL Italian cuisine that isn't overly priced for the quality of food you receive! Not to mention their incredible wine list with a wine for any and every palette! I have dined here on multiple occasions now and can honestly say it's one of my favorite places to go. Whether sitting at the bar and enjoying a divine signature cocktail with the fun upbeat bartenders, or sitting at a table and receiving a one of a kind dining experience....you're guaranteed to leave happy and satisfied!"}
{"text":"I have to give the restaurant credit. I go to red rock canyon very often. I hike a lot and love good food with wine. I normally don't write reviews but I think this restaurant needs better recognition. I stopped one day at red rock casino with my good friend after we came down from mountains. He was just visiting so I wanted to show him a nice resort. We like Italian food so we decided to try Salute restaurant...it was Monday...we got lucky :) It was Martini Monday so we started with vodka martinis for only $5...if I remember it was Sky vodka what's not bad for the price, right? Then we switched to glass of good wine. They offer nice wine selection. I ordered a glass of wine Gaja from Italy for my main course and they extracted it by the needle from the btl. so the air won't get inside the btl. how unique...now we are able to taste better wines by the glass. We started we appetizers something what would go nice with the martinis. Caprese and beef carpaccio. Great start, both were delicious. And we got fresh bread after we ordered. My main course was veal chop cooked medium with prosciutto sage crema, wild mushrooms and roasted sunchoaks (sunflower roots). My friends dish was the truffle ravioli with foie gras crema. We both loved it very much and for sure I am coming back by myself or with friends. Our server was very attentive and we felt very welcome. The bar and restaurant look is very modern with open kitchen. I can not wait when they will open the patio part by water for nice outdoor exercise. See you soon!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing Italian! Make sure you get the Arancini and get enough for everyone at the table to have two because you'll definitely want at least that many. The branzino is flavorful and a well sized portion. As a self proclaimed gnocchi freak I can confidently recommend the gnocchi as the one of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food! Atmosphere on the patio is amazing. Service was fantastic. Nothing we requested was forgotten. More bread, done! More wine, done! Food was delivered exactly as ordered. We were very impressed with our first visit to Salute. Have to give a shout out to our server, Kevin. Thanks for being so  good at your job! ;)"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant the food is great, the service is wonderful !!  The prices are very reasonable .All the staff goes out of their way for you especially Nate at the bar and Lisa who is a server .  On Sunday nights they have 2 for 1 entrees for patrons over 55 between 5 and 7."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight with two friends  Issue list: Hostess was rude. Hostess did not seat our party first when another party arrived later. (outdoor patio seating). Hostess claimed outdoor seating not guaranteed for reservation, but claimed other party had outdoor reservation. Servers were slow - did not come around. Had to ask servers to fill water. Servers got order wrong and accused us of lying about our order. Took 20 minutes to get the bill paid. Cockroach showed up at our table and staff killed it in front of us and did not apologize for it at all.  terrible service ; only average food ;  - yeah - it's not a good experience."}
{"text":"This is the fourth time I've been to Salute and I don't plan on returning anytime soon.  Extremely disappointed  on Mother's Day.  My husband and I took my oldest sister to brunch there and left hungry.  The $28 portion of veal marsala couldn't have been more than 2 ounces and nothing came with it.   To add insult to injury our waiter was lazy.  After waiting 20 minutes for another drink which he never brought, he came asking if we wanted to order desserts.  I don't recall that he even apologized for not bringing the drink.  He just said I can bring you a drink now.  I can deal with things like this on an ordinary night out, but on Mother's Day NO.  Unfortunately my sister and I both ordered the skimpy veal.  At least we didn't gain any weight!"}
{"text":"***Beautiful inside, good service, questionable management, overpriced lackluster food*** We chose this place as I've been wanting to try it for classy Itallian food.   As walk-ins we were told they prefer reservations from the man in a suit at the hostess stand and was told by the seating hostess again that they prefer reservations because of something about wanting your name? And they took our name before seating.....uh why? We started with cocktails. My blood orange spritzer was incredibly bitter. My husbands drink was mostly frozen (we didn't realize it had homemade Italian ice in it which was slightly troubling later on when we were picking out pieces of lemon rind from our mouths) but was tastey and had a smoother kick. I switched to ordering this drink instead of the spritzer after the first round.  Appetizer was arancini with bolognese sauce. The rice was a large grain rice and was undercooked. Sauce was very greasy and meat wasn't very good. I didn't even finish one. Hubby ate most just because he was hungry. I ordered a filet mignon for my entree- I asked for it medium and butterflied. The waiter had to ask if they were able to butterfly my steak. Strange! My steak came out hideous and unevenly cooked. Flipped it over and it was obvious the filet was cooked whole til done, then cut not correctly in half and pressed down causing a weird sort of creased paper effect so the steak didn't lie flat and was very overcooked and was a different doneness almost every bite. Also, by far the fattiest filet mignon I've ever seen. Came with an arugula salad, cherry tomatoes, and balsamic glaze which was awful and overpowering on the steak and the salad was incredibly salty.  My husbands salmon was dried out and fishy in the middle- not fresh obviously. The risotto was also bland, dried out, and rice pastey/chewy he reported. **We ordered an extra side of crispy red potatoes- those were AMAZING** As for staff: our waiter first came off very patronizing but he was in actuality very friendly and helpful. Table was cleared promptly, drink refills a plenty and lots of random staffers checking up on us. Thumbs up on service! They were also very kind to us when we accidentally signed the receipt without giving them the payment and walked out. They quickly caught up to us and we rectified the situation apologizing profusely which they insisted was no big deal."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Everything was amazing.. from the service to the food. Top notch! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We did not have a reservation on a busy Saturday night but the hostess graciously found a table for us. The semi circular booths are not comfortable! Our server was delightful and attentive throughout. Cocktails were good and reasonably priced. So that's the good part. Appetizers, Arancina was cold and tasteless. Crispy Calamari was not crispy. We were delivered a little pizza that we didn't order. Caesar salad was good, We asked for anchovies on the side and for four diners, received four slivers. And then the bread came? Entrees. The flaming vodka was nicely presented but the gentleman pushed the cart away from the table so we didn't see 'the show'. Truffle pasta was so bland and veal dish, well I won't go there. Here's the point. There was no seasoning at all. No herbs, no salt, no pepper. Just dollops of unseasoned and characterless food. don't waste your time or hard erned money if you want anything remotely authentic."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor. Beautiful staff. Exquisite food. Service is excellent. Any mistakes are taken care of asap. Slow days do not exist, the gnocchi is to die for. Take your loved one on a date or bring a group in for a fun party. Intelligent kitchen staff who have perfected classic Italian dishes w a modern twist. Pricey, but nothing good is free in life."}
{"text":"Tried this place out with friends tonight. Everything was excellent, food, atmosphere and service. We had the Branzini, Chicken Parm, veal Marsala and chicken piccata. Everything was delicious. Even the side pastas were superb. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The restaurant in this space previously always felt like an overpriced, pretentious, trying too hard Italian \"Cucina\" but following the redesign and reopening as Salute I think the overall ambiance and environment much more closely aligns to the feel of the rest of Red Rock and the location is much more suited to the demographic of people who didn't necessarily seem to latch on to the prior white tablecloth formality.  Not to say that Salute isn't a nice place, but it isn't rigidly formal.  I find myself often sneaking away from the slots or more costly offerings at the casino to wander to the back of the establishment and people watch at the bar.  The service has always been impeccable, and the young lady behind the bar on my most recent visits, Chelsey, exemplifies what I hope to find anytime I am out enjoying myself; attentive but never overbearing, knowledgeable enough to make recommendations and clearly communicate menu items, but without the condescension or brow beating up sell found so often in Vegas.  And while I am perhaps too enamored with the overall flavor of the experience, I can also unequivocally make the case for the spinach lasagna as the perfect indulgence to complement the experience and to ensure an enjoyable afternoon."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant for the first time last week for dinner and drinks with a friend. We sat at the bar which was nice and open to the outside. Honestly, the bartender Nate is what made our experience that much better. He made one of the best old fashions I've had! He knew the menu and his recommendations were on point. We had the big meatball app and for dinner the Cioppino which was all delicious. He made us feel welcome. Thanks for the great experience Nate! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Good time at this restaurant we have walked by many times. Glad we tried it. First the martini was good and my better half actually had one too after sipping mine. The bartender was friendly and helpful as we sat at the bar waiting for our table, by choice. The bar starts indoors and extends to a patio where you can dine. Nice atmosphere on a warm night. We were shown our table and requested another and got it. We ordered calamari and clams casino. Both were delicious. She also ordered a Caesar salad and they split it for both us to enjoy and it was great with the right amount of dressing. Entrees were mergerita pizza and veal parm. Pizza was decent, but the veal parm was the best I have had in Vegas. Service was just right and helpful. We enjoyed it and will go back."}
{"text":"The good: Food is excellent. Staff is professional, courteous, and efficient. Atmosphere is really nice. Not so good: Overpriced. Menu prices not the same as online menu prices or even the board in front of the restaurant. Website says open 11 AM-11PM.. we had to wait to get in for dinner because they weren't open. Problem with the bill- supposed to be Happy Hour prices for drinks, but were charged at full price. (To their credit, they corrected this when it was brought to their attention). Last, $8 for an extra meatball?!?"}
{"text":"Nothing special at all food is edible food chain kind of food  very  commercial by the book Americanized Italian food  I think the Olive Garden is better and that's about as bad as it gets I won't b back"}
{"text":"5 stars! The food here was excellent, everything tasted great from start to end! (Especially the tiramisu, it's to die for!!!!) Our server Kevin was great, he always made sure we had everything we needed and got us our food promptly. The atmosphere was also really great.. Sat on the outdoor patio and was very relaxed! Great place, I would recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I will never frequent this establishment. We arrived at 9:20pm when their hours posted are 10pm. The manager greeted us at the door and said \"would you like to sit at the bar for drinks?\" We replied yes we would like a few drinks and appetizers. So he tells us to take a seat at the bar. Then he proceeds to come behind us five minutes later and motioned to the bartender with his hand to his throat like cut them off. He was telling the bartender to tell us the kitchen was closed that don't let them order food. My husband is in the industry and understood right away, he didn't want to tell us until we sit but they had no intention of serving us. He was rude. They were slow and places cry no business but when you are there and it is not convenient they turn you away to leave early. Well needless to say we proceeded next door to Hearthstone and a few hundred or so dollars later after a bottle of wine, appetizers and cognac we had a great night with pleasant service. Do yourself a favor and keep walking!"}
{"text":"New to Summerlin Restaurant profile Salute did a great job.  Il be back great food, strong service, cool bar.  Homemade ice cream cones!!!!"}
{"text":"When a modern restaurant has veal on the menu it shows me that they are un-evolved and tone deaf to the issues of inhumane treatment of farm animals.  Veal is cruel.  Veal which is baby cows taken from their mother's and put in small crates should not be on menus for any restaurant that wants to be in the 21st century. When this is the first thing you see on the menu then this is a place that you know the chef and owners are stuck in the dark ages. Until they evolve this will not be a place that I will ever eat at."}
{"text":"At first the service seemed a little slow and flustered but they quickly got on their game!  The veal marsala and the lemon chicken are to die for. Chopped salad delish.  Lasagna was just ok.  Donuts and the cannoli are ahmazing!  Definitely order the it's amore cocktail, I was not planning on drinking and ordered a club soda tasted my its amore and It was so good I had three!"}
{"text":"We went to Salute with our friends and went early enough to beat the crowds. We had a reservation and were actually seated promptly. Our waitress while nice seems to have too many tables to keep up. Not her fault but the management should have made better staffing plans. We ordered wine and drinks that took quite a while to come. We ordered 2 types of salads, Caesar and Chopped. Caesar OK Chopped good recommend the meat in it for the extra charge. I ordered a Silver Oak Cab which is grossly overpriced but i know what i was getting into and it was good. Now that is as far as it goes. Every entree was awful. One lobster pasta dish had bad/old lobster which made the guy sick the next day. The ladies had a chicken pasta dish that they almost couldn't eat. My veal chop was nothing but gristle and fat with no taste. For all the dishes we needed to have salt and pepper to get any flavor at all.  I have placed a call into the General Manager to let him know about our experience but he has not returned my call. I assume that is symptomatic of the problems with this place. It is too bad because a good Italian restaurant is needed in Summerlin. I would never go back and not hearing from the GM is unconscionable."}
{"text":"I have given this restaurant too many chances. I have come here many times for work dinners, and the service is always \"meh.\" I have walked in on a non-busy Tuesday night and been turned away with an empty restaurant as they wouldn't take walk in's. Then, tonight was our 4 year anniversary and somehow they did not receive my confirmed reservation for two. After I showed them the email confirmation, they still couldn't come up with even one spot for two people. This place is appalling. I will now try to urge my boss to not bring our large work parties here ever again. Worthless!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time at the restaurant, but with family this time. Even though the cacao de Pepe wasn't suppose to be available, they graciously allowed us to order it. Cheese wheel came out and fun began. Noodles were cooked al dente and complimented the sauce well. Service was excellent and servers were very attentive. I'd recommend to anyone who enjoys good pasta"}
{"text":"Delightful server. Dinner was BLAND, boring, and minuscule. Veal Marsala was plated beautifully. All 3 tiny pieces of it.  Linguini with clams had NO  flavor and 8  \"Seed clams\" if you are from back east, those are the clams that are illegal to take because they are to small. Far to expensive for tiny portions with NO flavor."}
{"text":"Food is amazing ! Atmosphere is lively and inventing. Make sure you have reservations though! Most the time the bar is even packed with people ! Portions are generous as well!"}
{"text":"Loved the wine, cuisine and the lovely ambience! This a new spot in town and worth visiting."}
{"text":"Our meal was fantastic, the starter of mixed charcuterie, cheeses, and salads was a perfect mix of flavors and generous in size. Pasta course was an incredibly delicate gnocchi made on site...phenomenal. Entrees of seafood risotto was great but the veal marsala was truly one of a kind and out of this world. A must have to finish it off is the house made ice cream & waffle cone - worth the trip in itself!  Great & attentive service to boot!"}
{"text":"Fabulous sea bass. Will come again when in Las Vegas. Visiting children, grandchildren and great grandchildren from West Palm Beach Florida"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The bartender Nate went out of his way to make our experience the best my wife and I have had in a long time.  The food was spectacular and I recommend the meatballs and the linguini vongole.  We will definitely be back and make this our new date night spot....thanks Nate!!!"}
{"text":"Undoubtedly, one of the worst dining experiences of my life. Went on Christmas with friends and we all agreed. My husbands meal came to the table cold, cold lasagna. Awful. My meal came about 10 mins later. Tableside signature pasta. Again cold and tasted absolutely flavorless to both me and my friend.  My husband sent his soggy, cold meal back and was rewarded with a clicking of the tongue by our waitress. Things go awry in restaurants, I get it, but the way were treated was just comical. Never going back, ever."}
{"text":"I went there today to eat there and the customer service was terrible the food wasnt as good as i thought it will be dont recomend this place"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful!! Such a wonderful atmosphere and staff and food!! One of my favorite places to take my family when they come to town! Stephen is always our server and hes never let us down."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Will definitely be coming again. Elegant vibe and great food. Perfect for a girls night out"}
{"text":"In response to the wine list comment I like to say that we were looking at the list on your website as none was presented to us at the table.Tried to go back a few times but they are always \"fully commited\"..Maybe thats what they should change their name to.."}
{"text":"This place offer a free martini at the check in and you need to beg to the people at the bar to get it! If you loose money doing this don't offer nothing ! And the Bar man with beard it's mean and he say he don't care!!! Don't come to this place to leave your money here! And salute please take care of your employees actitud! Never come back again !!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big Italian eater, but this is by far  the best Italian restaurant I've been.  First I felt very welcoming than most Italian restaurant, I don't feel intimidated.  We have the best waiter in the restaurant and in the city.  He was amazingly polite and professional friendly.  I order a drink that off the menu and the bartender was able to do it for me, he even come out and check to make sure it was ok.  If you like creamy cheesy pasta, the House Pasta is a must try, table side serving.   We also have the whole fish, Acqua Pass flavorful, not fishy. Everything was 5 star...Kuddo to the Manager and Chef."}
{"text":"Highly recommended!  I dine there almost weekly and have yet to have a bad meal.  The patio seating and outdoor bar are excellent places to sit, even in the hot summer months.  If you're at the bar be sure to have Chelsea take care of you!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had beautiful ambiance as well as friendly servers. The food was delicious and the service was great. Definitely would come back!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Was having drinks at Hearthstone and the bartender told me Salute was run by the same company, so I had to check it out. Our server (Michelle) was very friendly and steered us to some great choices. The Antipasto starter had lots of great little bites and was perfect for sharing. My wife is still raving about her Caprese salad. I've never had a Saltimboca done the way they do it, with the bone in and pounded thin instead of rolled up. I'm a convert. It was great. My wife loved her Lasagna. The donuts we had for dessert (Zeppolis, I think) we're a great end to a great meal. Thanks again Michelle. We'll be back."}
{"text":"If you love Italian then this is a great location. I was hoping for a few more meat options, but made due with what they had."}
{"text":"My friend and I dined here last night and everything exceeded our expectations. The first thing we noticed upon walking in was the beautiful ambience and decor. I want the chairs for my own house! Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu items and offered some great suggestions. Even the busser was very attentive making sure our waters were always full and plates cleared. I ordered the chicken parmesan which was cooked perfectly and so delicious! Probably the best I've ever had. My friend had the signature pasta which she loved! For dessert we got the nutella cake. Whatever you do, save room for this dessert! It melted in our mouths!! I will definitely be returning to Salute next time I'm in the Summerlin area."}
{"text":"Nice casual Italian at Red Rock.  Great Happy Hour from 5-7.  Good is great and cocktails are nice.  Very nice patio weather permitting!!"}
{"text":"We walked in without a reservation, left our name for an hour plus wait, but then the manager or hostess (someone very kind) ran & checked the bar & came back to get us for 2 seats that had just opened up at the bar.  Chelsea behind the bar took excellent care of us & our dinner selections were perfect. I didn't care for the very fishy ceasar dressing (of course anchovies are in Ceasar dressing but the Parmesan Ceasar subscription in the menu through me...) but they replaced it with a chopped salad that was perfect. The special pasta (usually made table side, but not at the bar) was amazing & the saltimbocca was perfection!  It was a great dinner & we loved sitting at the bar, such good service!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok... it's a hit or miss the last couple times we went. We go because we like the ambience, option to sit inside or outside. It's located in the perfect area of red rock as well. This last experience was probably the worst therefore writing the review hoping someone from the team will read it. We were there the other evening and I believe they may have some VIP or executives there so we received very little attention as everyone seemed very concerned with that one table. Food was very slow to come out but the executive table's food just kept coming out. Someone constantly was keeping an eye on them but we felt very neglected as we continued to wait patiently. Also, it doesn't hurt for the managers to greet clients. Never did anyone else other than the waiter greet or said goodbye or even check on our table. Some kind of acknowledgement would have been nice. There was probably atleast 3 managers on duty that evening just staring at the exec table the whole time. I'm sure one day we will give it another shot but not for a very long time."}
{"text":"We ate at the bar tonight, as it was my first time at the restaurant but second for my husband. I usually hate sitting at a bar for dinner but didn't mind it as both the bartenders were super friendly and recommended things on the menu. We loved the decor, parm cheese wheel & barolo by the glass, I WAS SOLD INSTANTLY! Nate was more than accommodating & ordered us the 10 oz meatball and nutella cake for dessert. Will definitely be coming back here. Can't believe it's been open for long and we are just now trying this out. Thanks Salute!"}
{"text":"I don't know what to make of this place.  We had a reservation and still waited 20 minutes when there were 3 available tables that our party could have been seated at. I felt like I was in the Seinfeld episode when he made a reservation for a rental car but when he showed up they didn't have a car for him. Felt like they didn't understand how the whole reservation process works. The appetizers were good, wine was excellent, but then the main course was a dud for everyone at the table. It was either bland or too spicy. I don't know if they have a rogue cook (see the other unhappy reviews)back there or it was just an off night but with that and the poor service we won't be back. Adding to that was the long wait for our courses, I understand not rushing but you have to go at the natural pace of the table. We were buying wine so it felt like they were taking longer so we would have to order additional bottles.  Lastly I also don't understand why restaurants make it so dark so you can't even see the food your eating.  We've all been there pulling your phone out to light up the menu so you can read the menu but, this was strip club lighting."}
{"text":"My husband, myself and our couples friends had dinner here on a Saturday night w/ a 7:30pm reservation. The four of us checked in at the hostess stand at 7:33pm & were seated at 7:45pm. We were literally at our table for 20 minutes, BEFORE ANYONE greeted us!! What an umbrage that was.   My husband had to flag one of the staff members to assist our table.  Nine more minutes passed, before a female server (FS) showed up at our table; totally callous about our long-wait (she was amicable, albeit unapologetic). The FS took our cocktail order; and forewarned us about the diminutive serving size of the pasta entrees. And she was correct, since we ordered the \"Table Side\" pasta w/ Vodka sauce and meatballs; and the serving portion was deplorable for $22.00! The FS proclaimed to our table that she will make sure to have the kitchen put four fried zucchini flowers for our appetizer & when the appetizer came out, it only had three flowers!   In summary, Salute was overpriced with immensely slow and disorganized service.  The decor was elegant, modern, and the kitchen whips up delicious foods. The Assistant General Manager (AGM) - Anna Golden apologized to our table & took off two cocktails from our bill; and gave us complimentary dessert platter (7 types of desserts) at the end of our evening.  MAYBE we will try Salute again in the future.  I will keep my fingers crossed for the restaurant to improve on organization and initial greeting time."}
{"text":"Delicious sea bass entrée. Zucchini flowers very tasty but pricy.  Service was great. Very friendly adding to a positive experience."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time the other night. I hadn't been in this space since Terra Rosa years ago!   I'm a bar diner. I definitely think you get the best service. Nate, my bartender was awesome. Slightly sarcastic, friendly, fast, and knowledgeable about the menu.  He suggested starting with Arancini; fried, golden rice balls of deliciousness. The texture was divine. I paired my appetizer with a glass of Pinot Grigio.   The managers were friendly and checked on me after my entree arrived; the lobster. Perfectly tender and succulent. Definitely a home run!  I'll be sure to be back and check out happy hour! Highly-recommended."}
{"text":"Two strikes and one star for this less than stellar reinvention of the wheel. I was regular at Terra Rosa before the remodel...and was really looking forward to a fresh new face on good bones. Sadly, they only thing that is well done is the interior design. Its beautiful and chic but ends there. My first attempt was \"grand\" opening weekend, Sat. around 8-9.. headed in for a long awaited plate of pasta, and the sour faced host says they are no longer serving food and over capacity..???? huh? the place is half empty. Id just like to sit at the bar and have some pasta....uh no \"thats not gonna happen\" we're done for tonight come back tomm.... wow you dont have ONE plate of food left on opening weekend?...no apologies, not even a glass of wine, nothing. Strike 1. So I waited a few weeks for them to get it together and tried again. 1 Linguine Vongole, zucchini flowers, tiramisu desert, and $50 later, Im terribly terribly disappointed. All are not only my fave italian dishes but staples of the cuisine and should be served to perfection in a place with all these bells and whistles.   The Bad and the Ugly:  Linguine tastes like it came out of a sodium filled can. Clams were the smallest I have ever even seen in my life. (caper sized, literally) Zucchini flowers overstuffed with ricotta left nothing of the actual flower Tiramisu was nothing but sweet, over sweet cream. I only ate half  And lastly but not least the bread.....EPIC failure. Italian bread is art and this was play-doh. Just a sad dinner roll away from wonderbread.   The people next to me at the bar were equally disappointed in their vodka pasta served over a flame, stating it tasted like rubbing alcohol and sent it back.   Overall this place should shut the kitchen down and reevaluate. BOOOOOOOO!"}
{"text":"Celeste my fav bartender from Bottiglia works here now yay!  Lovely ambiance looking out to the beautiful outdoor patio.  Hand crafted pasta & $6 HH.    Celeste recommended the Spinach Mezzaluna on HH menu, which is a half moon shaped spinach ravioli stuffed w/ ricotta.  I could've eaten it as an entree.  Delicious w/ whatever wine she paired w/ it.. I think it was the $6 Merlot.    For an entree, I shared the Rigatoni Salsiccia.  It was a large portion so glad I did.  I love peas so next time will order it w/ extra & a little ricotta on that dish to cut the salt from the pork sausage.  (Note to self:)  Also loved the pomodoro cream sauce, reminded me of a vodka sauce & the rigatoni was cooked perfectly.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Food is good !!! Service such a turn off!!! Second time here and the service was even worse this time ."}
{"text":"Salute is a great place for date night. It has a romantic, upscale vibe and is relatively quite although the restaurant itself is quite spacious. You do, however, pay for the ambiance in the price of the food. The food is good, but leaves more to be desired in terms of flavor. My boyfriend and I split the signature pasta and margherita pizza. The margherita was baked well, and the pizza sauce was light but not overbearing. It is a modern style of pizza with no added on tomatoes, but only shredded basil.   The signature pasta's creation process has a huge wow factor - the staff bring over a huge cheese wheel wherein ignited vodka is used to melt the cheese before coating the pasta noodles. For an additional fee, you can choose to add your choice of protein. But at $26, I felt that this pasta was overpriced because the portion was quite small.   The best part about the visit was definitely the house bread and butter, and the service. The butter is slightly sweet and adds so much flavor! The waitress we had was excellent, informative, and very attentive. I'm glad we tried this place, but I'm not sure we would go again."}
{"text":"My wife and I were excited to try this restaurant as it was recommended by a couple of dealers and the hotel concierge. It was our anniversary and were excited to sit down and try something new and kid free. We are from Colorado and like to eat outdoors when ever possible. We made a reservation and hostess was kind and fun to talk to on the way to the fun and unique patio. But thats about it. After 25 minutes and an overwhelmed server who came to use multiple times saying that he would be with us shortly. We left after near 30 minutes of waiting just for a drink. We did not care to stay and see the performance. The server appeared overwhelmed with 8 tables. Two others were floating around but did little to nothing.  This place was just a diaster and we left."}
{"text":"I don't often write reviews, let me rephrase that, I NEVER write reviews but this place deserves one, hands down the best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas. On top of the 5 star food they have great waiters here and beautiful waitresses I will be a regular here weekly!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here after getting a discount coupon by being a Red Rock Casino patron. Could not be happier with the food or service. Drew our waiter was on top of everything and very attentive let alone knowledgeable of the menu. It was very nice to have a server actually check on the food shortly after serving it. I had clams casino, chopped salad, and braciole. Food was excellent and the bread and flatbread were enjoyable. George the runner was very nice and attentive as well. Will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Brought my girlfriend here tonight for her birthday. Our waiter Jason was awesome, this guy never allowed my tea to get empty before he brought me another. Jason's recommendations on the dishes was great. He surprised my girlfriend with a nutella birthday cake that surprised her and just finished off the evening in a great way. Definitely going to come back and recommend this restaurant to many others. Great Job tonight Salute!"}
{"text":"We had drinks here tonight because we thought the ambiance was very nice, but when I saw the bill for 2 drinks, might add nothing special nothing specialty....my jaw could have possibly hit the bar.  A whopping $35!  Seriously!  That's a $16 drink each.  We won't be going back!"}
{"text":"First of all, why did this restaurant replace Terra Rosa? Terra rosa was a 5 star restaurant, each time I dined, food, service everything excellent. However when salute took over we tried it the very first month of its opening. That visit was a disaster.. Terrible food and slow slow service. The manager assured me of better experience and told me to give them a chance. We gave it another shot today, many months after and it barely moved up a star! We were told our food was delayed because the kitchen was backed up.. The restaurant was half empty, on a Saturday night of 4th July long weekend. Howerver the table next to us (who came after we did) got their food and drinks much faster than us. They have too many water and bread guys but few servers. Bread took forever. My husband ordered their signature pasta which is cooked table side in a giant 80 lbs Parmesan cheese block. The problem is, tossing that pasta in the cheese block, makes it COLD... So why am I paying $24 for cold penne ala vodka? I had the gnocchi, which was just ok, nothing spectacular to repeat. Wine selection is decent. We wanted to order a second glass of wine with entree and it took so long for the server to get back to us, our entree was over. I wound not recommend this place and I will not return."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night for happy hour and sat at the bar tables. We got one of everything on the happy hour menu and everything was so delicious! The Arancini were my favorite ! I usually don't do salmon unless it's cooked and the carpaccio was so delicious we ordered a second one. I also had the Caesar salad which you can't go wrong with. For dessert we had the tiramisu and I ate it all! Service was great and the restaurant is beautiful! Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves !"}
{"text":"Service isn't great at all. We got here at 6 (with no one at the bar) we had a party of 7 people. Spend about $400 we were ignored most the night. Took 10 mins to get water. both Nate and Little blonde bartender are VERY rude. I still tipped 20% which was probably a bad idea they def didn't deserve it. Manager isn't special either. Bad attitudes for a restaurant that wasn't even busy. Quit hitting on girls who don't pay for there drinks. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, prompt, and friendly. The food was fresh and delicious. Not what I was expecting from a restaurant attached to a casino."}
{"text":"We love this new Italian restaurant at the casino Priced great Food great Drinks great It's great, really great ;)"}
{"text":"Heard many good things about Salute and finally got to try.  Had a wonderful experience with Nate the bartender let him make his specialty cocktails.  The food is amazing make it a spot you want to try."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place.  I've actually been wanting to try it for some time.  Unfortunately, the food was so salty, it really had no flavor.  I had the gnocchi with added bolognese.  My boyfriend had the pappardelle with bolognese.  We did also have the tiramisu, which did taste good, but I wouldn't say it was anything special.  Our waiter, on the other hand was very friendly and attentive.  I don't remember his name, but there were no complaints there."}
{"text":"WHO DOESNT WANT TO EAT PASTA THAT WAS TOSSED IN A BIG WHEEL O CHEESE? The only way to make it better, if if they put the big wheel in front of me with my pasta in it and let me lick the cheese!   I went here for my birthday dinner and got their signature pasta with shrimp. It was soooo good! Not the BEST pasta I've ever had (that was in NY), but it was delicious. Plus, again, cheese wheel. The noodles were perfectly al dente and the shrimp wasn't overlooked. I believe the sauce is a vodka sauce but not 100% sure. Overall, it was enjoyable. If you're in the neighborhood, stop by and give it a try!"}
{"text":"We came here for a convenient dinner. We were going to go across the street, but I checked out the menu of this place and decided to try it out and everyone else agreed too. I guess I remembered loving Red Rocks last Italian restaurant so I thought this place should be just as good. The place is really fancy. I guess I didn't really pay attention to the prices when I was checking this place out. We were a bit underdressed, but I thought that if this place is expensive their food must be good. This being Vegas, that's not always true.   The service was good, our glasses were always full and our waiter was nice and helpful. To start we got a big antipasto plate and I ordered the prosciutto with burrata cheese because I love burrata cheese. Some freshly baked sesame bread came to our table first. It was hot to the touch, the crust was a light brown and it was covered in sesame seeds. I tried a piece only because my Mom said it was really good. Their bread is fresh with a soft and light center. It went great with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Our appetizers came fast which was to be expected because nothing was really cooked. The antipasto was alright. The parmesan cheese was served in huge hunks which made it weird to eat, like no one eats parmesan that way. It's too rich to eat in big chunks like that. The mozzarella balls were flavorless, needed some seasoning. The ricotta and basil wrapped in zucchini needed to be served a little warmer, cold ricotta is just really gritty and no good. The olives, prosciutto and peppers on the plate was good though. The burrata was watery and bland which was disappointing because I was looking forward to it. I liked the thick and sweet balsamic that was served with it though. It was tangy and sweet, great on the prosciutto and freshly baked bread.   Next came salad which only a couple people ordered. I tried some of my Aunts caprese salad that was served kind of weird. The plate had only a few small tomatoes and a huge portion of mozzarella, not very balanced. She just gave me some of the cheese. It was kinda gross, I had trouble getting it down. First of all it looked weird, it had like small black specks in it, which is highly unusual. The cheese was spongy, soggy and flavorless, bleh. There is just something wrong with the cheese here, which is really sad considering it's an Italian place.   Our final dish of the night and best dish of the night was their veal marsala. My Mom and I split it. It was plated very elegantly with edible flowers. It was a small portion, but it was split and we weren't too hungry so it was perfect for the both of us. The veal was delicate, yet had a good bite. The marsala was excellent with whole pieces of mini mushrooms. It was a bit on the salty side though. Needed some water after eating that dish. My Dad got the seafood risotto that he was very disappointed in. I tried it, the seafood was good, but the rice was undercooked. My Aunt got the salt baked branzino and was also disappointed in her fish, she said it was bland. I tried it and actually liked it, thought it was cooked very well, but I could see how it could get bland if that's all you had to eat. I felt kinda bad that not everyone was exactly happy with their meal because I chose the place.    This place was way to expensive for the food we got, it wasn't good enough, not worth it. Just an overrated and over priced Las Vegas restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow!  Amazing food and service.   My girlfriend and I went and had the daily special - mine was a lobster pasta and it was outstanding.   Definitely a place I could go for a date or just for a random Tuesday night.  I love the look of the restaurant....all of the new places to dine are getting me back to red rock!"}
{"text":"So this was mine and my husband's first time at Salute and unfortunately we weren't impressed. Our kids consider us foodies and I agree with them. We enjoy fine dining on occasion and for this restaurant being open not that long I was expecting top notch service. Our service we received was mediocre. I inquired if bread that was brought to the table was sour dough and he said yes. Then server came by and said no it's just a sesame seed bread but definitely not spur dough. Well turns out it was sour dough. So staff wasn't clear on what they were serving. To me this either shows lack of knowledge on wait staff or on management's part for not informing them properly. Secondly, I ordered the Pappardelle Alla Bolognese and pasta was in my opinion tough. My husband ordered Veal Marsala and veal was well over cooked. Not tender as described in other reviews. Maybe chef was having an off day not sure. Long review short with mediocre service and food that's why I give it a 2 star."}
{"text":"Stopped at the bar for drinks before being seated outside for dinner. Our bartender, Amanda, was great. Our dinner server (John, I believe) was completely out of place and seemed like a lost puppy.  The water and bread guys were very nice. Food was OK. I ordered the signature pasta--delicious, but overpriced at $26 for the portion size. Hubby had the lemon chicken for $24. It was tasty, but there were no accompaniments. It, too, was overpriced in our opinion.  Sat outside next to the waterfall, which provided lovely ambiance. Will we go back?  For drinks, yes, but for dinner, probably not. Vintner Grill is where it's at for us.  P.S. On our way out, the table behind us (with the same waiter) asked if we enjoyed the service. They felt the same way we did, but agreed the the food was tasty."}
{"text":"This was our first time there the food was exceptional. The meatball by itself was very tasty and huge. I ordered a side of angel hair pasta in garlic and olive oil cooked to perfection. Zucchini flowers was my appetizer the side tomato that came with it was delicious. My drink the lemon drop was my only this concerned it should have been sweeter and more lemony. Our waiter drew that has been working there for over a year-and-a-half was outstanding on top of his game and went out of his way to make sure our experience was perfect. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience Saturday evening.  I had a nice little table in front of the antipasti station and enjoyed watching the two working behind the antipasti station.  They were very nice and explained the different antipasti dishes and desserts before we were seated.  Unfortunately, that was the extent of the enjoyment before the mayhem started!!  A short black lady was yelling at a server at the antipasti station to \"move\" so she could get in.  It wasn't like there was a fire or emergency.  She could have been more professional but I could hear her complaining about the \"mother-f***ker\" that he needs to move and she doesn't need a lesson on how to talk to people.  This is unacceptable behavior!!  She was in such a frenzy, pushing the two workers out of her way.  The two behind the bar appeared very uncomfortable and quite frankly I felt embarrassed for them.  Then a chef came out drilling the young man to \"go faster, faster...how long does it take to make this...give it to me now\".  Not sure what the young man was making but it looked like he was going pretty fast mixing the stuff in the bowl.  I proceeded to walk out but wanted to speak to a manager first.  The lady I was told was the manager appeared at the antipasti station and began demanding desserts and had that \"b1tch\" face when speaking to the two workers.  Where is the professionalism from these people?  I have no idea how the food taste.  I left without speaking to the management in fear they may bark at me.  That's how bad it was to witness this first-hand."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and was not served.  Had to walk out on sunday night.  They had 2/1 coupons for seniors and my friend was not a senior, they were so rude about it and said maybe the coupon is no good.  I should have left right then and there.  Sat for about an hour waiting for meal.  Never served.  Finally just left the place.   Worst service ever. They claimed short staff and too many customers were allowed in sunday night.  A disgrace."}
{"text":"Italian restaurant  at the red rock casino. It's pretty price but is brand new and has a great atmosphere. Overall very friendly service. We dined relative late and the staff was accommodating and knowledgable. I think the reviews reflect the relative high prices for an off the strip italian restaurant. But for red rock next to the their steakhouse this is the classiest place."}
{"text":"Excellent service makes delicious food taste even better. We had Rigo as our server tonight and I could not have asked for a better server; very attentive and friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. The Brussel sprouts and clam spaghetti was delicious! We will be back next visit to the Red Rock Resort."}
{"text":"I stopped into Salute with a friend for happy hour.  The bar area was pretty hopping but we were able to find a seat.  The bartender was a little standoffish.  We had to ask for the Happy Hour menu since he didn't offer.  His general demeanor pretty much stayed uninterested during our sit.    Since we still wanted to try some items, we ordered the Arancini balls, 2 piece Truffle Grissini, and Calamari.  The calamari was lackluster.  The bland appetizer was definitely a let down.  The truffle grissini was better than expected but the prosciutto wrapped breadsticks were on par with the calamari.   What I did like were the Arancini with fontina cheese, ricotta and bolognese. Pretty tasty flavor and melty cheese when you cut into them. If anything I would come back for those.  But I wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"Came in for HH with a friend. Menu is small and quality is hit or miss. The arancini were amazing, but the calamari was lackluster and unseasoned. The Truffle Grissini (proscuitto-wrapped breadsticks smeared with truffle butter) were better than expected but overpriced at $6 for a pair. Service was quick but standoffish. Wine menu looks good, and their cheese-wheel pasta looks like something I'd like; I might return for dinner but I'm not in any hurry."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem located right in Red Rock Casino.  From the moment I walked in the ambience was amazing and service wonderful.  We first had a drink at the bar. The bartender was knowledgeable on the wine list and suggested the perfect glass for me.  Then we went to our table where our server was just as familiar with the food menu.  My favorites I tried were the grilled branzino and signature pasta.  Will be back sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Expensive disappointment ~  Reading the not so great reviews I should have known better but when a business has 3 stars you just never know as it can go both ways. In this case we were highly disappointed.   Let's begin with the positives. The restaurant is beautiful but doesn't remotely feel Italian but it's very nicely laid out so walking in you're naturally optimistic. The service was great as well and as the food kept coming out it was pretty much one miss after another.  We started with the fried zucchini flowers that were bland & heavy, awful starter that set the mood. Before we were finished with them, out came our Caesar salads and it was the worst thing we tasted during this meal. The salad didn't taste like anything, it was as bland as it gets. Next came out the margherita pizza and again before we were finished with the salads which I couldn't even finish. The pizza was actually really good and is the only thing I would order again. The dough was airy & thin and everything paired very well. Lastly we had the signature pasta that comes out heated & tossed in a Parmesan wheel which was very cool to watch BUT what ended up being served to us unfortunately didn't taste great. Everything was one noted ~ bitter. The meatballs were bland and when the bill came at just over $80 it was hands down the worst $80 ever spent.   Beyond disappointed & wont be back."}
{"text":"Berry berry good. The pasta along with everything else was good.... I was also 6 drinks in.  Got the calamari and seafood pasta. Muy bueno cackboy"}
{"text":"So we get here and its a 2 1/2 hour wait.. But in the mean time two bar tables open and never sat anyone because one is the owners table and the other table is the chefs table ?  mean while people are waiting to be seated interesting  they never sat anyone on those tables So we ended up an hour later outside by the bar with the server Chelsea who I might say was outstanding with her recommendations. The flourless chocolate cake was sinful delicious.  But they had few choices for us Gluten Free peeps. Would I got back it's a maybe :-( the branzino was okay I've had better! The truffle gluten free pasta was a winner and so was the albacore  crudo"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the door I knew we had made the right choice to dine. The atmosphere was perfect, beautiful decor, ambient lighting. The hostess was gorgeous and friendly, she sat us immediately. We were greeted with our waiter shortly after. He made excellent recommendations on the wine and food, which was phenomenal!!! The bolignase was by far the best I ever had. During our short wait for our food, the manager Brian N came and introduced himself, he made sure our experience was that much more special. We will definitely be returning. If you want amazing food and atmosphere.at reasonable prices Salute is a perfect choice."}
{"text":"This restaurant is newly opened so we expected service problems.  Hopefully as time goes by this will correct it self. The pasta with meat sauce was very good, tasted like a slow cooked sauce with homemade pasta. On the other hand, I also had the hamachi tartare, fish was not fresh and shouldn't be on the daily menu with day old or two fish. We will give it another try in a few months to see if things are better. It's pretty thought when Brio is just a short drive away and is excellent all around"}
{"text":"One star cuz we walked in and walked out due to rude, indifferent service by the bleached blond, tattooed chick behind the bar. We sat down at the bar (only one other patron sitting at bar on a Thurs nite at 6:40 pm). Two bald male patrons proceeded to come and sit down at the corner of the bar, which apparently barmaid knew, she proceeded to go over to them first, fall all over them, (barely a hello to us when we sat down), chat it up, reviewed new menu items with them, took their drink orders....then came over to us, mind you after we'd been sitting there well before these other two apparent VIPs. She proceeds to give us food menus, hello we came in for a cocktail and are sitting at the bar-we're not looking for food just yet. Had to request happy hour menu to which she finally provided after chatting again with her buddies in the corner and putting their order into the computer, then as HH menu so tiny, had to ask for drink menu which she took her sweet time getting-they're right under the bar-takes a second, but she was exacting her attitude on us. She proceeded to stand there with her full on back to us talking to these other two gentlemen who must have been really important, as we sat there ignored. We proceeded to get up and walked out as she echoed \"thank you have a good evening\" to us. That was the most attention we got all night. Too many options in Vegas and were pleasantly surprised ending up at Hearthstone and having a prompt friendly bartender, good drinks and delicious meal. Sorry Salute-you had your chance."}
{"text":"I was drawn into this Resturant by the picturesque indoor/outdoor bar and fountain surrounded patio with a great vibe, but after sampling a number of specialty cocktails and recommended appetizers & entrees from the captivating bartender named Chelsea, we have been back to sample cuisine and enjoy the ambiance a half dozen times in the last month.  The entire staff was overwhelming friendly and Chelsea made us feel recognized and was charming.  This spot is a gem for great food and cocktails on the patio, but it is the staff who makes it even better-   6-11-16. Just had another wonderful meal @ Salute with rockstar bartender Chelsea - thank you for making our experience there even better"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant ever!!! I don't really ever hype about restaurants bc I'm very picky and hard to please, but this place is DELICIOUS!!! I always get the ravioli lobster MY FAVE DISH EVER and my bf gets their signature pasta (that they make homemade right at your table!!!) The dessert is wonderful ! I tried the tiramisu and. It's the best tiramisu I ever had! Try this gorgeous Italian place and you won't regret it ! A bit pricey but high end Italian food is so worth it !"}
{"text":"My first time in the venue and it was an amazing experience. Our server was extremely  knowledgable and walked our group through the menu as we were all first timers. Our drinks never ran low and we got all around great service. The food was one of the best Italian meals I've ever had. Their pasta presentation in the Parmesan wheel was amazing. Chef came to our table personally to ask how our meal was.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm vegan; however, they had gluten-free pasta, as well as brussels sprouts that were oil free, and oil free potatoes.  It was all incredible. My father got the lobster ravioli and he said that it was out of this world.  The service was wonderful (I'm not an easy customer, but they treated me like a queen) as well."}
{"text":"This place is very nice, all the food is amazing and they have a lot of options for food items. I rate this 10/10. I ordered some mozzarella sticks and some pizza and a Philly cheese steak and some wings,me and my family enjoyed the food. I will always come here to eat."}
{"text":"New Year's Eve.    This place not so good Honestly I think they hired people just for one night   Without going into detail.   Just a mismanaged establishment.    How do you not have maximum attention to detail on this night.  Ran out of certain alcohol.  And bartenders look at you like \" so what\".   Expected for contracted one night employees.  O well. Live and learn."}
{"text":"I can only rate on the bar experience. We went in for dinner and started at the bar for cocktails and appetizers. After this part we had seen enough and forwent the dinner. Instead we grabbed a Capriotti's sub from the food court and went home. We started at the bar and I asked about the house wines.  They were from a keg and the bartender suggested I order a glass if I was not used to keg wine, but I was welcome to try it. I declined. The ladies next to us asked if their house wine was Italian. No, it was not. One you are an Italian restaurant and supposedly \"upscale\", keg wine is not allowed. Two you are an Italian restaurant and supposedly \"upscale\", Italian house wine is a must. Three your house white is Reisling and when poured looked like it was full of effervescents (bubbles).  That should have been strike 3 we are out of there, but we continued on. I ordered a Rose (I know not Italian at all, but their wine list was not very impressive and not very \"Italian\"), they were out. I settled on white that I had never heard of before. It was ok, but not for $10 a glass. Bonefish's $3 house white compared. The wine portion of our experience was a fail. On to the appetizers. We ordered calamari and the salmon carpaccio for appetizers.  The calamari was not over cooked, but a tad greasy.  It was adequate for Olive Garden, but not your \"upscale\" dinning experience.  The salmon carpaccio was good, but cut way too thin. Thin as in it broke into a billion little pieces as you tried to get it off the plate. The salad served on top was good, but a tad too bitter with all the radicchio. As far as the food, it too was a fail.  The whole experience was a fail. We were excited to try and in the end excited to leave. Thank you Capriotti's for dinner, the Italian sub was delish."}
{"text":"The decor. The food, the environment and wait staff are all fantastic!   All and all a very welcoming environment that could make for a great date.  Extensive wine and cocktail menu makes it the place to be at the Red Rock Casino.   I went a little under dressed but didn't feel out of place at all with how friendly the service staff was."}
{"text":"Love this place! Beautiful inside. I've dined here in several occasions and have always enjoyed myself. The saltimbocca is easily my favorite. Delicious and beautiful dish. Last time in lieu of a salad I tried their small anti pasto platter: meats, cheese, veggies. Delish!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Made a reservation on Valentine's Day through the yelp app, and got a call immediately back. Arrived about 15 minutes early. The host said the table was almost ready, and showed me to the bar. Halfway through my drink I was walked over to a booth by a lovely host named Leslie. She had mentioned that the booths are the best seats in the house.  Food was super delicious, didn't leave anything behind. We ordered the signature pasta which is made right in front of your table. Also added a meatball which is one of the best meatballs I have ever ate.   All in all Food and service excellent, highly recommend this place. Management seems to have everything well and done correctly and under high standards."}
{"text":"Went there for Valentin day. I had the Bella cocktail. It was alright. We had the Chopped salad. It was excellent! For appetizer had the Crespelle, which was basically chopped wild mushrooms in cheese. It was a little salty but still really good. Loved it. The lobster ravioli were shaped like hearts but really didn't care about them. And the veal Marsala was ok. The Nutella cake for desert was excellent, came with ice cream, loved it. Our server was Jozef. He was so very attentive and helpful. I'm not impressed with the food. Not worth the price, at all."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Fri 9/18 with my gf. Sat outside and after 15 min of just sitting there someone came over with water. 5 mins later another person (not our waiter) came over and asked \"how is everything?\". I said, \"we would like to order something, no one has come over and we have been sitting here for 20 mins.\" He immediately grabbed our waiter (tall,old and bald) who seemed annoyed and clearly frustrated/confused (don't know why, he only had 3 tables and a couple other people assisting him). We ordered the albacore app and two entrees (snapper and veal bolognase ). He took our order and left. Didn't see him again till the check came. Anyway.......the albacore app was very good. Melts in ur mouth. Snapper was ok,very small. The veal bolognase was very very small and a little bland. Could not add any pepper/salt because there was none at our table nor was I offered any. I was also confused because some tables were given bread and oil and we were not.   To sum up the dinner, we sat down to an empty table, put our order in, ate and left. Why go? I would have received the same experience ordering it to go. I'll just stick to Siena or capos if I'm craving italian food."}
{"text":"Favorite place to chill and grab a bite.  Service and food is always on point.  Great place to sit at the bar or outside during the spring and summer."}
{"text":"Came with a group for the 1st time. Had a couple amazing cocktails and dessert was on point! A must try"}
{"text":"We ate here the 2nd week they opened on the patio fantastic atmosphere and service. I have eaten at the bar here many times after that with girlfriends at the bar. Always great service and great wine selection by the glass an Italian Barolo you can not go with. The coconut cake is to die for. I once came back just for that."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. Went with my girlfriend around 10pm on a Friday, only a handful of other customers yet service was very slow, we were constantly waiting for our server to come wait on us. He seemed to be focused elsewhere and was constantly disappearing.   Beef Carpaccio appetizer had a strange taste and was far too lemony. Complimentary breads and butter were all cold and bland. My girlfriend had the Gnocchi, it was mediocre at best, mostly just a pool of sauce, she ate about 3 bites of it. I had the Lasagna, it didn't look appetizing at all and tasted of nothing but the meat sauce it was drowned in.   Everything was overpriced. I would rather go to Olive Garden and spend half as much money and at least have some decent tasting food. With all the other options out there for Italian restaurants, I would absolutely never consider returning to Salute."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. I sat there for over an hour and my food still wasn't ready even though the people who sat down after me got their food. The waiter was a duchebag and so was the manager. This place won't be in business long. High prices, stuffy atmosphere, I won't be coming back. I've never been so humiliated in my life! Grape street cafe in downtown Summerlin has better food, better wine selection,and better bet for the money!   What made the whole experience worse was I'm a patient person and if the manager or waiter had come up and offered me a free drink or appetizer I would've been happy. But to sit down for over an hour and the waiter wasn't even sure if my food would be ready anytime soon, or ever, is ridiculous. And then to let me walk out the door like I mean nothing is crazy.  When I complained later it was like well the waiter was overwhelmed and we shouldn't have sat you down. Really? Omg. It took you over an hour to realize that?"}
{"text":"What a beauty! Salute is such a romantic local restaurant.  The inside is just gorgeous.  Their pasta presentation is such a cool experience that will surely impress your dinner party. & it doesnt stop there! Every dish is presented like an eloquent work of art.   The food is delicious but they could definitely use more vegetarian options. All in all, I am happy to reccomend Salute for date nights and classy outings."}
{"text":"Had the most memorable Father's Day with my Dad.  Gioni M. provided the best, upbeat service I've ever had at any restaurant.  Her details of every dish if you inquire is amazing.  She tells you every succulent detail of every ingredient and how it is prepared.  I was in the Army for 20 years- with several short tours and a long tour working in Italy.  The gourmet served here is about as close as you can get to Italy.  And Gionni's knowledge of Italian cuisine and her language skills were also a pleasant addition to her overall service.  I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Salute is located at the Red Rock Hotel & Casino. We went to Red Rock since there are a number of choices for dining allowing us to watch the big game at the same time. Sometimes Salute can get a bit busy, I've had a couple of experiences at this place where it took a while to get a drink, place an order or get my check however the past two times I've gone the service has been pretty good. We were seated and ordered some cheeses wine and an eggplant caprese to start, it had a nice pesto sauce finish around it, pretty tasty. Next we ordered truffle ravioli which wasn't hot when it came out and the chicken piccata to share it came with two small breasts and was just ok . These portions were not the biggest I've ever seen. More the way I like it especially after the Cheese and salad we ordered along with the bread they bring seemed to fill me up just right. But I can see how someone would think these portions are too small ordering for their entree . All in all it was a good meal on the patio with the World Series game on the TV made for a good night. 2 entrees 2 appetizers 3 alcoholic beverages and 1 espresso. $123"}
{"text":"The place is cozy, with warm and friendly staff. I ordered the signature pasta. They mix this dish in front of you with use of their huge 3 year old round cheese with some vodka. Amazing! So far, one of the best pastas I've ever tasted. Everything about this place is superb.! Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"if it weren't for the great service i probably would have rated lower.  from the servers to the managers, we were constantly being checked on, yet they weren't overbearing.    the food...different story.  it wasn't the best but wasn't the worst.  i felt for the quality of food, it wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"We were a party of four with a huge shared antipasto, different entrees and a huge shared desert. Service and food were all exceptional. Place was very crowed for a Wed nite but we were seated outside which was great. Can't say enough good stuff about this place in the Red Rock Resort. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Ask for Joseph, he was delightful; food was amazing; atmosphere was comfy!  Tonight we called at 7:15 on a Sat night cause we couldn't get into another restaurant; we were told to come at 7:45 & was seated at a table on the patio with a beautiful view of the front of Red Rock Casino with the water & fire pits...Steve was great, food is amazing each time we come!"}
{"text":"First visit to Salute and unfortunately it will probably be my last. Great location, pretty restaurant, but I found the food to be bland and nothing special and the service was inattentive and slow. The table side signature pasta sounded amazing but our group found it to be particularly bland and flavorless. Another low note was the baked rigatoni.  I think the problem with this dish is that we had just recently had the same dish at Nora's. It was so outstanding at Nora's and this version just didn't even come close to being as good. On the plus side, we got 3 different salads and I thought they were all very good. Our server was nice enough but we barely saw him and the gap between finishing our dinner and ordering dessert was way too long. I really wanted to love Salute because it's so convenient and I love a good Italian restaurant but it just didn't happen."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with my girlfriend and had an amazing experience. The food, the service, the ambience was outstanding. the server was very knowledgeable about the food and he manager helped up pick out the perfect bottle of wine. The wine list is great btw. Will definitely be coming back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed in our meal here, and feel bad about it, as it was arranged and comped through a friend. Four of us went to celebrate my Birthday, recent status change, and extended visit to town. The restaurant is beautiful, everyone was gracious, and service was on point.   The food just underwhelmed three of us, aside from housemade pastas, nothing seemed to say \"I must come back for this!\" And, quite honestly, if we had paid for the meal, we would have sent the appetizers back.   Dad really enjoyed the lasagna; Scott liked the gnocchi a great deal; and Mom's Carbonara was spot on; I had the House Special Linguini made tableside in Reggiano wheel: it was good, I love fresh pasta, am a turophile, and kvell for a flambèed dish, but it was a little one-note for me. The appetizers were awful: stuffed zucchini blossoms and arrancini, just not well prepared not at all tasty, and these are dishes I grew up eating. Three of us had the whole salt crusted baked branzino and it was flavorful, the Chicken Piccata reported to be very good, broccolini side was fine.   The best part of the meal for me, was the cake they sent for dessert, and a nice Barolo we shared in the lovely dining room. Again, had we paid for this meal, it would have been very disappointing, and it would probably be bordering a 2* review, except service was truly amazing. But you can't eat service and atmosphere.   When we staycationed recently at Red Rock, the same friend offered to make arrangements for Scott's extended family to join us for dinner here; I politely declined her generous invitation. I have neither plans nor a desire to return."}
{"text":"This is my third time having dinner here. This is a new restaurant and the service is much better and the food is fabulous!"}
{"text":"80% of tables are available yet they don't seat anyone because they are \" fully committed \" Happened multiple times"}
{"text":"Las Vegans (locals) have waited years to finally tout an Italian restaurant that you would be proud to take your Grandmother to and now it's housed at the Red Rock Casino.  This restaurant is another product of the impeccable \"customer service first\" methodology that was behind the Light Group now under the moniker Clique Hospitality.  Andy Masi and Brian Massie put together another home run filled with delicate pasta, flavor bombs in the form of sauce/gravy, tender meat offerings and mouth watering cocktails to wash it all down.  We've dined here multiple times although personally I've never changed my entree (since it's that good).  The service has always been spot on with just the right amount of floor presence by the AGM and GM each time we've visited.  Our meal always starts the same way, an order of \"That's Amore\" (bulleith, aperol, lemon, basil) with a \"Campania Sour\" (50 bleu vodka, liquore strega, citrus, egg whites, lavender bitters) for the wife.  Our appetizer selection is typically the Meatball due to the soak-it-up-with-bread marina that remains once the abundant portion of meat is ingested.  For our entree, I always order the Veal Milanese \"Saltinbocca\" (veal chop, fontina chesse, speck, crispy sage) since it can feed 2 people but mostly because it tastes fantastic the next day as well.  I literally crave this dish.  My wife has ordered various items, the best being the Salute Signature Pasta followed by the Pappardelle Bolognese and the Lasagna (who doesn't like bechamel?).  Overall, I can't wait to go back and love that Red Rock has some serious eats to offer the local population.  As the Italians say \"Buon Appetito!\""}
{"text":"I had made a reservation ahead of time for a Saturday night dinner with my family and when we got to the restaurant we had to wait about 15 minutes or so to be seated. The hostess offered us a table right by the entrance but there was too much foot traffic around there so we asked for a booth. She responded with a very off putting and disingenuous smile and response, \"then it'll be another 15 minutes until we can get you seated.\"  The food is ok at best. You can go to downtown Summerlin and have much better Italian food at Grape Vine or Tratorria Regiano for half the price.  The service is highly unorganized; you can just take a look at neighboring tables around you as waiters scramble to put silverware on a table while the bus boy stands there with 5 hot entrees in hand, ready to serve people their dinner.  They poured water all over the table when filling up glasses of water and took quite a while to bring out a side of pasta when I found out the  Ciopino I ordered came without any. Basically they brought it out once we had finished our dinner.  Oh and this place is very noisy, it reminds me of a high school cafeteria. Not a great place for an intimate dinner. We won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, food...was a solid meh, not the freshest or the best, but not awful either. Again, maybe its the Red Rock curse but service is seriously lacking. The waiter was exasperated by our questions, felt the need to highlight the price of a few of the $$ items we ordered and seemed to be giving us the bums rush from beginning to end (in-spite of the fact that it was a Monday evening and there were only a handful of tables aside from ours)  Started with a very nice array of breads, then the caesar, it was OK. Hubby had the grilled filet medium (delivered rare) sent back to re-fire, 2nd time delivered med-well, I had \"Handcrafted pasta\"  with shrimp (scialatiella) tomatoes were mush & the shrimp were so over cooked they were inedible. Since we had already sent the steak back for re-fire I didn't want to send back the pasta, but did mention it to the waiter. Nothing was done about it, no apology, no credit, nothing. The only saving grace was the overpriced 30 year tawny port we finished the meal with, best thing we had all night. Long story short... 200 bucks we'll never see again :("}
{"text":"Went here for an Italian Thanksgiving feast. We were pleasantly surprised with the authentic menu and excellent service. Our server Jason was not only kind and attentive, but also highly knowledgeable about the different types of cheese on the fly. We enjoyed ourselves after a not so pleasant experience earlier in the day at the Wynn. We highly recommend this hidden gem and can not wait to return."}
{"text":"Had a really amazing dinner last night. The restaurant is beautiful from outside in. Service was also very good.   Started with the meats and cheese board. Super fresh prosciutto right off the slicer. Highly suggested!  For entrees we shared the signature pasta done table side in the cheese wheel. Very cool display and the taste is even better.  Also had the prime flatiron braciole. Cooked to a perfect medium and had really great flavor.   Nutella lava cake for dessert... Must have!"}
{"text":"Went back tonight to Salute for the second time and really enjoyed our meal. My husband got the chicken Parmesan and ate every bite. I highly recommend the steak Florentine. Marbled perfectly, overwhelming flavor and amazing presentation. It's enough for two people but if you're just one eat what you can and take the rest home! Served with incredibly crispy potatoes. I also really enjoyed their roasted root vegetables.   The ambiance is very laid back and casual but also upscale and romantic as well.   Service was excellent. Giada did a great job!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but now it is just \"meh\" to \"ok.\" I'd say this used to fall into the top 5 of my restaurants in town for overall dining experience. I'd come once or twice a month and the last trip (9-20-17) the service wasn't close to what it was. Just say I think it took about 1.5hrs from sitting before our food came out. On top of that seemed like the portions have gotten somewhere between 35-50% smaller depending on the dish. Oh wells I guess al things come to an end."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday dinner. Dinned in a private room which was nice however I personally love people watching in the main dining area.    Food: overall 4/5. Appetizers included: calamari 3.5/5 I prefer mine not breaded and some type of risotto balls with cheese 4/5 I'm sorry but completely forgot the name.  Signature pasta 4.5/5 is a must for the table, especially with the presentation. I had an opportunity to taste my friends meatballs and those were a hit. I would definitely order that next time. I ordered the sea bass grilled 3.5/5. I knew it wasn't going to be earth scattering but it was above average and I was happy with this healthier option.  Two ways to be prepared grilled or baked in sea salt.  My friend had the sea salt and it tasted very moist. My husband ordered the veal Milanese...yum yum 5/5 and it was a huge portion great flavor! Bread 3.5/5 warm and soft inside just not a huge fan of sesames. We shared some dessert platter 4.5/5 that included caprese pie and tiramisu were my favorites.    Service: 4/5.  Very attentive throughout the night.  My only complaint is I hate after the bill is paid they never fill up water. I'm still thirsty!  Lol.   We love the location close to our home. We look forward to trying this place again and will recommend it to others."}
{"text":"The place looks amazing.  The food varies from just ok to very good.  They got two things we ordered completely wrong.  We ordered Linguini Pomodoro and got Pene in a marinara.  We wanted the chocolate cake but got the coconut instead (it was delicious though).  Worst of all we had undercooked chicken.   Apart from that, it's generally over-priced for the quality and taste."}
{"text":"So dissatisfied with the vodka pasta special! They changed it to a spicy pasta instead of the amazing creamy parmesan it just to be. Service was a bit off. Had to ask for cutlery and for drink top offs. We also had empty dishes and glasses on the table that were never cleared. Better service at carmines for half the price sorry to say this place was my favorite and now it's no longer."}
{"text":"We chose this place due to my friend wanting to try the table side pasta. It was something the six of us were looking forward to but I'm afraid we were all extremely disappointed. I expected much more from this establishment due it it's prime location inside the RED ROCK CASINO. The ambiance was pleasant but they still failed us in other ways. We all ordered different dishes. Presentation was on point but the taste was mediocre at best nothing impressive to want to return to. The main reason for our dissatisfaction however was the service. Our server seemed to have an attitude from the moment we sat down. His name is Irvin. Now keep in my mind we're all in the industry so we are well aware and as forgiving as possible when it comes to service if we can see they're trying to accommodate their guests, but this never happened. We found ourselves ignored, our glasses empty, weren't offered bread and weren't sold on any dishes and a simple task as receiving our check took about 15 plus minutes. The busser acknowledged us more than our server. It was discouraging seeing him pass by us several times to take care of his other two tables while we continued to be  ignored. It was definitely not worth the visit. This experience put a huge  damper on our dinner and evening and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've got to believe that my rating will improve over time, because my only reason for a 3 vs 4 star rating is the slow service.  After soft openings, and 2 weeks of being open to the public, the servers and kitchen should have their issues ironed out by now.  We had dinner reservations at 7:30, and by 8:45 we were still waiting on our dinner salads and drink refills; dinner entrees showed up around 9:15.   When we arrived the main restaurant was not busy at all, nor was the bar (moderately) or outdoor patio area.  I'd say during our entire evening there, on a Saturday night, the entire place never was more than 1/2 full.  So being \"too busy\" couldn't have been the issue with the slow service.  Our servers were all very nice although we had to remind them to bring us drink refills, and our food various times throughout the evening.  It started off well, with drink orders and appetizers served right away, but then it just deteriorated.  The food however, wow!  We ordered the burrata plate and the arancini as appetizers and both were very flavorful and fresh.  The bolognese sauce that comes with the arancini reminded me so much of my mother's, very meaty, tangy, rich flavors.  Yummo!  My hubby and I both split a caesar salad, which was also quite good, but just your basic caesar salad.  My hubs ordered the seafood risotto as his main entree, and he said it was just \"ok\".  I had their Signature Pasta dish, with meatballs and I'm telling you it was amazing!  It's creamy, and everything wonderful that pasta a la vodka should be.  The only complaint is that, although it's supposed to be prepared table side, and provide you with a visual experience as the chef prepares the pasta and sauce inside a giant wheel of parmesan, my order was NOT prepared table side.  Even though, after we reminded the waiter we were still waiting on our main entrees, I was told the chef would be out shortly to prepare my signature dish.  No chef.  No table side fun.  The atmosphere in here is inviting, and nice.  There's niches where you don't feel like you're on top of your neighbors, and yet there's also areas where you're more out in the open.  The bar provides a nice area to sit and have a drink, chat and/or watch a game or two.  And the outdoor seating is adorable.  In all, we will definitely go back as the food and atmosphere redeemed the lack of faster service.  Not sure what the issue was, and I see from previous reviews service has been its main issue thus far.  Everyone was quite friendly, and apologized profusely for the slow service.  Now let's just see if they can get it rectified.  It's harder to fix bad food than slow service, and the food ain't the problem."}
{"text":"Love it. We came for a ladies night out and it was so fun, nice, and relaxing on the patio! Wine selection was good. Portions are smaller ha normal Italian spots but packed with so much more flavor as well!  The table side pasta with vodka sauce...I die!  I have been dreaming about it since we dined there."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night. Overall impression - I didn't like it and I didn't hate it. The calamari appetizer was cooked appropriately; not too rubbery, so they didn't overlook it, that's good. It was a bit salty though, but the 2 sauces served with the calamari balanced the saltiness out fine. The Margherita pizza was quite bland, I've had better at Grimaldi's, CPK, and Sammy's. I did like the raspberry martini that the bartender made, props to them. Golden question - would I go back? Probably not. There are better restaurants that are cheaper, with similar mixology, and better food, that I can visit."}
{"text":"What a dissapointment!! We were so excited to try this new restaurant on Christmas eve and it was a complete let down.  It started with the hostess trying to seat us at a hightop in the middle of the bar, even though we made reservations more than a month ago.  After waiting a long time for our table, we could not even have a conversation because the room was SO loud. The most disappointing was the food. The appetizers were pretty good (calamari and burrata), but our entrees were terrible.  There were four of us and the only one that was really edible was my boyfriend's dad's steak (which was a special and pricier than a steak on the strip at $74!). My boyfriend had salt encrusted branzino that was so mushy and had no flavor.  His mom had veal marsala that was so dry, and I had linguini and clams that tasted like plain linguini with no broth.  We were planning on spending a decent amount, but for $400 plus tip (and we only had one bottle of wine), we could have gone almost anywhere in town and it would have been 100 times better.  We definitely do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning and very high fever after eating at this place!! Avoid the signature pasta thats tossed in a parmesan bowl!! Looking back now that cant be a safe and a clean vesicle to serve multiple entrees out of day after day! Its been 48 hrs finally broke my fever!! I will never go back paid 90.00 for 102 fever!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this and I usually don't even go on Yelp but this was by far the worst Italian food I've ever had ! The fried rice balls were good but that was it. You guys call that Gnocchi ? Overcooked , horrible preparation couldn't even eat the dish. Tagliatelle with meat sauce , the same . Veal was overcooked as well, tough as leather. I really hope someone reads this and fixes the issue. We love Hearthstone next door , wanted to try something new ..."}
{"text":"Well. Im 100% Italian and know Italian food. My first visit here and took a friend visiting here from Ohio. We were there during Happy Hour so we ordered from the Happy Hour menu. As most Vegas restaurant bars, drinks are over priced but WHY during Happy Hour?? Had the Calamari which was very good. Had the Margarita pizza which was also very good. How can your charge $9.00 for a tasteless meatball?? Im assuming the Chef is Italian but No Way can he say the meat ball tastes great. Really bad."}
{"text":"My best friend and I dined here and we really enjoyed it! The broccoli soup was PHENOMENAL. I was craving it the next day. The bread comes out warm and with more than one option.   I wouldn't get the squash blossoms again, it was more like a fancy mozzarella roll. We didn't eat much of the dish and no one noticed that we didn't like it.   Other than that everything was delicious. The octopus was done perfectly, I only wish there was more!  The fish of the day was actually a scallop dish with a beautifully done vegetable medley. I highly suggest trying this.  Keep a lookout for specials like half of bottles of wine on certain days and happy hour 5-7pm"}
{"text":"Thank you To our Server Steven and Table assistant. Service was fabulous. In addition, Steven offered to have the Chef come out to meet us. It was my Husbands 70th and he ordered the Veal Cop! The best ever hands down. Ken the Chef was so kind. We have been there a couple of times. Will be back for sure!  Thank you. Loyal and happy well fed Customers"}
{"text":"They use cute kerosene flame candles on the table. Unfortunately it made everything smell and taste like kerosene. Yuck."}
{"text":"I have been to Salute' twice now. Exceptional Italian food! The location is perfect with easy, free parking. The atmosphere is fun & relaxing. The service is great and accommodating. The first visit, I had the pasta spun in the cheese wheel. Sooo good! Second time, I had a ravioli dish that was out of this world! Entertainment is right outside the doors at the Red Rock Casino. Salute' is the perfect beginning to a great date Night!"}
{"text":"Great dinner for our group of 30.  Management and staff very accommodating with plenty of servers to keep this group going.  Great selection of wine.  Great entrees to experience here.  Try the Truffle Tagliatelle, Chicken Piccata, and Tuscan Steak.  Note on the Tuscan Steak that it comes pre-sliced and is served medium-rare.  If you like it cooked a bit more, make sure you tell them ahead of time.  We had the ice-cream cones for dessert with random flavors.  They also have outdoor seating as well.  Located in the Red Rock Casino and Spa.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"Monday night $5 martinis is what caught my attention. Let me start by saying if you want to impress someone bring them here this place is nice the ambiance is great, staff great, food great and did I mention $5 martinis all night..... I felt like I was in a romantic movie while dining here, some guy was singing Frank Sinatra hits witch made it all more impressive. I will return!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food, flavors that are tough to beat. Great up beat atmosphere especially when the patio is open. Definite local feel. Get the porterhouse it melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Update on Salute for their recently added Martini Mondays and a Live Crooner from 6 - 8 PM. If you enjoy the old standards check out the trio. The first set  was a one hour blend of instrumentals and vocals . Even if Martini's are not your thing there are plenty of other choices. Choose a booth adjacent to the kitchen wall for great sight lines.   On this occasion I decided to try the Branzino which is available whole salted roasted or grilled. I chose grilled without the skin. Served as 2 beautiful filets only needs a squeeze of lemon. The filets were melt in your mouth tender and juicy.  Although we had a oversight with the calculation of the bill our server Kelsey apologized and quickly resolved the error.  Kudos to Salute for bringing back lounge music from the super club era."}
{"text":"My Dad and I have been waiting to try this place.  I always try to give a new place about a month or so to work out all the bugs, bad servers, etc.  It was worth the wait, because it was fantastic!  We made reservations, so we were seated right away.  The service was fantastic.  The wait staff was very knowledgeable about the menu.  The wine list is good and the wine is cheaper than most places.  As far as the food goes, we both had Caprese Salads, which were as good as I've ever had.  I had the Canneloni, which are really Manicotti.  Canneloni has meat in it, and this only had spinach and cheese.  It was a perfect portion, too.  My Dad had the rigatoni and he really enjoyed it, too.  And his portion was huge, so he has lunch for tomorrow as well.  I had coconut sorbetti and pistachio gelato for desert.  They serve it in a cone, but it is served in a stand, so it is more like eating it from a bowl, and it was excellent.  My only complaints is one that is a common theme for a lot of upscale restaurants these days, and that it is very hard to see the menu, because it is so dark.  The wait staff has mini lights if you need to see, but I wish people would think more about that when designing these places.  And my only other complaint is that the bread is nothing special.  It does not fit in with the rest of the meal, which was over the top good.  It was like they bought a bunch of loaves at a grocery store bakery and just warmed them up.  There was no butter or garlic or anything, just some oil & vinegar.  They could do a lot more in improving that, but overall, it was a great meal.  And I definitely look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"Decided to eat at their summerlin location . I know they just opened but always enjoyed eating at a new restaurant because they seem to try harder to make your experience more enjoyable. Boy was I wrong . Food was OK , but it seemed the server  had no idea about the food and the items they offer , they where  busy so I get it I just wish these company's would take time to train their staff , instead of just hiring people who have no business being in the service industry . It is what it is another boring Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I came in with family the other night and am a frequent visitor. Usually the service is good but one server stood out in particular to me.   His name was kerry and I have honestly never had a server be so accommodating and attentive.   As someone who spends a lot of money not only in this casino but in salute I appreciated his outstanding customer service. It should not go without being commended.   I recommend requesting him as your server any time you're there."}
{"text":"I have a gluten allergy and they had gluten free pasta. The sauce was nice. For my main course I had the Branzino sea bass. Loved it. Nice place to have a business meeting, nice bar and lots of choices."}
{"text":"Meatball was delicious and Nate is my new favorite bartender. Music was good and plenty of fresh air on the patio."}
{"text":"Happy hour  menu is fantastic. Nate the bartender was outstanding went 2 nights in a row :) excellent .. Salmon carpaccio and pizza were excellent and the tiramisu the best"}
{"text":"Manager of this restaurant doesn't like people with supporting animals. Cannot enjoy your food if you have supporting animals, I think he should get a job with government not service industry."}
{"text":"Friendly service and good food, I enjoyed dinner here one night while I was in town on business.  We decided to order in family style. Appetizer we shared was caprese. Fresh mozzarella used was very good, I enjoyed this simple salad.  While waiting for pasta, a server brought a complimentary small appetizer of olives and cheese tray. Olives tasted like homemade olives, my friend initially refused to eat olives ended up finishing the plate.  For pasta, clams with white wine sauce. I asked them to make the pasta al dente, response was that's the only way they make it. It came out al dente but something wasn't right. I think it might be the quality of pasta they used. It wasn't bad but it was not what I just enjoyed a week ago in Italy, their homemade pasta.  For the main was grilled salmon. This dish just okay, it was cooked as requested. Just average for me.  For desert, we didn't share. We each ordered what we wanted. I had tiramisu. I liked the texture of mascarpone but didn't quite care for biscuits sticking to my cake. I removed them, had one bite the just left it there.   They have free wifi, since the cell signal was weak, I was only getting 3G at the best, I appreciate their high speed wifi.  Food wasn't exceptional but friendly service made up for it, so 4 stars for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food! Ordered the Branzino. Wonderful! My sister had the signature pasta and ate the entire dish. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service leave it less to be desired...we ate our food and wanted for quite a while for our bill...the owner needs to train waiter Misho how to take care of his customers quicker or he doesn't get a tip..."}
{"text":"Finally an Italian restaurant that's almost as good as my kitchen. Re-design of this space is open, a little more casual (could have done without the TV's in the bar area) and the food is good. Service was great. A little over pour on the balsamic in the olive oil for the bread but that was fixable. Only complaint is that they need to kick the seasonings in the pasta up a bit. The signature Vodka sauce is wonderful but could use some red pepper flakes. The Vongole could use more garlic. They did get the pasta al dente which a lot of places totally fail on. Veal chop was stellar. Whoever wrote the menu needs a little lesson in Italian...don't use the word \"gravy\"....use sauce!"}
{"text":"Was there with friends a couple weeks ago. We didn't have reservation on a wed night. We were told the place was sold out, but it looked empty. My friend for us a seat at the bar since she knows the manager. The food is good, and the wine list is nice. But the service is bad. We ordered a bottle of wine, but no one refill our wine glass for the whole night! I was sitting at the bar! It took forever for our coffee to come out. The coffee arrived when we were finished out desert. Another bartender dump my leftover cake. I told my serving bartender that I want to take the leftover home. I expect more service with the money I paid."}
{"text":"Bland, overpriced, small portions, layout increases noise level making conversation near impossible at peak dining times. Staff is pretentious. The food was just so blah I didn't even finish it. What was the point? If you want good food, don't go here. If you want to say you spend a lot of money and be \"here\", knock yourself out."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with the new restaurant that replaced terra rossa. Saluté is just terrible. The bread is white sesame covered bread, wine list is super slim. And food is just ok & lacks any creativity at all.  I've had substantially better chicken piccata at Cheesecake Factory for an Much better price. I would say that if I were going to eat Italian food I would skip this spot. Terra rossa was awesome - bread service was amazing. This place looks beautiful but service and food need to be upgraded asap. It's a new restaurant - I get it but if your salad beats the bread out of the kitchen - you're not \"making the bread to order\". You're just not ready with the bread. Go to the new restaurant in downtown Summerlin-Andiron. Same price point. Excellent service and amazing food with some creativity.  Skip this place if your planning on spending 100. You deserve better."}
{"text":"Dined at Salute last night and just so happened to be there for \"Martini Monday's\". I ordered a cosmopolitan (which came with Sky vodka) and it was great! We took our servers advice and ordered the special of the night which was scallops on top of citrus and Parmesan risotto finished with blood orange segments and micro greens. Let me tell you...it was a great dish. The scallops were a great portion and the hints of blood orange and citrus segments came through just perfectly. Will definitely be coming to Salute again !"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to come here before moving to Vegas. Probably two years prior. We loved the Parmesan wheel and the atmosphere. Well we just moved to Henderson and  One our friends was staying at the red rock. So we said let's go to this fabulous Italian restaurant. So so disappointed.they food was terrible The wheel was not the same. Had a terrible red sauce which reminded me of tomato paste why did you guys change the menu!!!! Do you have a new chief.  BIG MISTAKE!!!!  Won't be going there anymore. Very unhappy Susan O"}
{"text":"I always sit at the bar and have one of the appetizers. All that I've tried have been delicious, but my favorite is the Antipasto  Misto. The bartenders are attentive and are willing to make suggestions."}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COST! This Restaurant is inside the Red Rock Casino. (A lot of Locals) Went in for dinner, the place half empty, and the hostess asked if we could wait 5 min while they cleared a table. So we went to the bar. Just 2 of us. We walked by a half dozen empty already set tables. 2 drinks and 30 minutes later we were still waiting to be seated.  So we got up to go back to the hostess and there was a line of people there complaining about the wait. A nice old guy in front of me explained he and his party of six had been waiting over an hour for their food and he wanted to cancel the orders and that they were leaving. Then the hostess said, oh yea, let me seat you two, it will only be a minute or two more.  I understand wanting to get your customers to the bar for a few over priced cocktails but when half the place is empty, there is no excuse for making people wait over 30 minutes for a table!  My family are locals and we will continue to go to the Red Rock but do yourself a favor, go to the Yard House if your in the Red Rock or if you want Italian go 3 minutes down the road to Maggiono's!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying salute. Service was good except the waiters aren't familiar with the menus or food ingredients yet. We were charged for another tables order, which they fixed. Over all food and atmosphere was great! Prices with drinks are about $55 per person which can seem high for Italian food,"}
{"text":"Vodka Sauce dish is a must! They prepare @ your table side. My husband and I went there for our 7th Anniversary. Def will come back  Cannolis are amazing with orange flakes inside. Service is prompt and very friendly. Atmosphere is romantic with a warm fuzzy feeling. We sat outside by the water area."}
{"text":"Well well well....dont go on a Monday night...slow service  ..waited over an hour for our food...not good"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic!  Now you're curious as to why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5?  The service is not very good....our server whom I'm sure is a good guy but on this particular night he was not very good.  He forgot about our appetizer all together and he wasn't the friendliest server in fact the gentlemen assisting him were much nicer.  Back to the food...their signature pasta is fantastic!  My son ordered the Flat Iron Bracio, he absolutely loved it!  We also had the chicken and sausage dish...very good as well.  I'm sure if they shore up their service I'm certain that their ratings will go up...maybe?"}
{"text":"I wasn't very pleased with the place very expensive for the  portion sizes and they really lack in The customer service department. Took forever to get our food and they were running out of a lot of things. I don't think I'll ever go back to this place again."}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant at dinner peak time, we were looking for a table outside, the ladies were very nice in telling us to come back in 15 minutes and they had our names down. In 15 minutes, we came back and it was obvious there is no places available still, but since she promised, she did some calls, and requested it to happen. We were seated in a very nice spot. Food: One of the most delicious food we ever had. There was a delay in delivering the main dish, the delay was merely 10 minutes, but due to that, the manager came personally to apologize, and offered a full appetizer delicious plate. Before we touch the plate, our food was being delivered. I loved their care and sensitivity, I had to leave a tip of close to 40%, this is how happy I was for being there, especially after my bad experience during breakfast at Terrace in Wynn."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Salute twice--once before the restaurant was open in a private dinner for 6 people and on opening night when seven of us gathered to try a number of dishes.  Items ordered:  Pizza acqua Arancini Aumm Aumm pasta Truffle tagliatelle Linguini with zucchini flowers Linguini vongole Spaghetti carbonara Gnocchi Pappardelle Bolognese Baked rigatoni Crespelli Cannelloni Lasagna Sciué Sciué Spaghetti and meatballs Signature pasta Chicken parmesan Lemon chicken Side of broccolini Zucchini flowers Bomboloni Toasted coconut cake Flourless chocolate torte  There are some winners in the pasta heavy dishes we tried.  The Signature pasta, done table side with flaming vodka in a wheel of parmigiano reggiano to melt some of the cheese and then having the vodka sauced pasta finished in the melted cheese wheel with some fresh basil leaves pulled off a plant and mixed in the pasta.  The flavors are very good and it's one of those fun dishes to watch being created at your table.  The lasagna is a must try dish.  It's layered spinach pasta filled with tomato béchamel sauce and bolognese gravy.  The béchamel-cheese in the layers is creamy goodness.  The gnocchi, pappardelle Bolognese, and spaghetti carbonara are good choices.  Dishes to avoid:  Zucchini flowers, baked rigatoni, spaghetti and meatballs, and the arancini.  This was opening night but the room was a veritable zoo that night.  The service was all over the place.  Our server was very good but his bussers just weren't up to the job.  There were times that there were main dishes to serve and there were no share plates for the table.  Our server tried to rectify this only to have some of the workers ignore the problem at hand.  You can;'t chalk this up to opening night jitters.  There had been a couple of soft opening nights prior to this one when many of these issues should have been addressed and solved.  I'll be back, but they need time to sort out what's right and wrong with the service and to make some corrections to the food, specifically the meatballs and some other items.  Salute has a lot of promise but they'll need to make some changes to deliver a good product with good service."}
{"text":"A solid Italian restaurant experience, great food, outstanding service and fairly priced That is what you want from a restaurant, right - three key things  Our dinner here, with family, was really good experience.   We were seated in five mins, in a pretty busy restaurant and a server was assigned to our table. The server was the one who made the first impression, as it is normally the case. Our server was very versed with the menu and explained each dished we asked in details, impressive least to say - its a reflection on the server, the chef and manager   We ordered the Gnocchi, Chicken Marsala and Pork sausage and the Chocolate cake   All three items, were shared and top class. Truly enjoyed the dinner here, will be back  This restaurant is n the Red Rock Casino"}
{"text":"My wife stopped in Sunday night for wine at the bar for Happy Hour, each got a great glass of house Cabernet for $5, then took the rest of our wine to the table and ordered entrees. Her short rib ravioli was amazing; my veal marsala with a generous portion of mushrooms and spinach and some potatoes was excellent. Will go back."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in the atmosphere was great. We were immediately greeted by the manager Brian. We were offered indoor or outdoor seating. We started by sharing a couple appetizers. I highly recommend the Carpaccio and Arancini. The main pasta entrees were delicious. Our server was Nate, he was very attentive. We ended the night with some chocolate desert and processo. I highly recommend Salute for your next date night."}
{"text":"My most favorite Italian place that I have been too! The service is great! It's a nice feeling when everyone just cares to you. I really feel like a VIP when I come and eat here. The food here is wonderful, they have great appetizer. The best calamari Iv had in a long time. One of their best dishes is the Signature Pasta, what a lovely presentation. They bring this big wheeling of cheese and melt it right in front you. It's by far my favorite dish they have!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend treated me out for a birthday dinner here. It is located in the Red rock Casino. There are two entrances, one outside of the casino and inside the lobby.   Very nice interior. It gives off a very romantic, yet casual feel. Service was great. Everyone was very accommodating and we were checked on every few minutes to ensure everything was running smoothly.  Ahi Tuna Tartara ($18): 5/5. Tuna had a slight kick to it. However, it was nothing special. I enjoyed eating it with the semolina chips provided.  Salute Signature Pasta ($26): 3/5. The infamous pasta cooked in a cheese wheel. I decided to add pancetta for an extra $6. Very cool show. Vodka is poured in a cheese wheel, which is then lit on fire. Cooked pasta is then added and then mixed with the melted cheese. However, pasta lacked seasoning. The waiter forgot my pancetta, but after bringing it to the table, it brought a lot of saltiness to the pasta. Although a very interesting concept, the food left me underwhelmed.  Food seems to be a big hit or miss. Will probably come back to try more food, but I won't be too disappointed if the chance does not present itself again."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was good. The cheese in the antipasto misto wasn't very good (dry and hard), but the rest of the food was yummy. Nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Came in here for a reunion dinner with my girlfriends. Our hostess Gili was very sweet and our server Drew was awesome. Service was great and food was delicious. Will definitely be back!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really had a great experience here!!! It was so awesome!! Of course we ordered signature pasta, which they make in a melted cheese wheel by the table. Also tried their veal and it was excellent! I will be going there again definitely!!"}
{"text":"We came to Salute on a whim. There were six of us and we had no reservations. We ran into the manager at the door, he had a beard, he was more then accommodating. He walked us to our table asking us how our day was and if we where locals. We sat and the service was great. Everything was good  until the meal came out in pieces. The first three got thier entrees and the it took ten minutes to get the rest. We called over the manager and he apologized and bought us dessert for our troubles. We will be back for sure due to the kindness of the management team and thier staff."}
{"text":"Delicious food.. Enjoyed burrata & prosciutto, eggplant pasta, Veal Saltimbocca, tiramisu and of course delicious Italian wine. Very Italian vibe and really good service. Plan on spending the evening there, it is not a fast place. The table side pasta looked delicious, I definitely will be eating that next time."}
{"text":"Love the chic atmosphere!   And any restaurant with a patio gets a little extra credit.  And Salute does theirs right....Nice decor with comfy \"indoor\" seats.    Appys---Arancini is fabulous!   Large with a scoop of soft cheese all nestled on a fantastic meat sauce (like crazy-yum & need that on some pasta please!).   Sorry no pic...they went too fast!  Salad---Misto was a light, fresh, healthy size portion of spring greens w/what looked like English cucumbers, tomatoes & onion.   Oops, forgot Drinks---Moscow mule was perfect and whiskey sour was yum-o as well!   Only pic I managed to snap.   Main course---signature meatball (big enough to be a meal on its own!) was Deee-lish!, signature pasta was just ok, butternut squash (sweet w/ a touch of cinnamon so I'm not a fan) is not a do-over and the chicken parm is HUGE (I don't like chic parm but hubs enjoyed it).    No room for desert or an after dinner drink (rare....almost always make a point of saving room, but couldn't stop ourselves).     If you leave here hungry then there's a problem, Houston!"}
{"text":"Overpriced but good food and atmosphere, the \"Its Ammore\" might be the best mixed drink I've ever had. Service has always been great here"}
{"text":"Okay... so let me start of by saying Salute was AMAZING!  From the get-go everything was organized, the staff was attentive, professional & polite. Michelle was our server and she was informative and very knowledgeable of the menu. She made suggestions when I asked her opinion and she did not disappoint. I ordered the signature pasta with vodka sauce, tossed in a cheese wheel, flambéd with vodka and added meatballs. The pasta was made in-house, (which I feel is hard to come by these days) and cooked perfectly al-dente. My nephew had the chicken parmigiano and he said it was the best he's had in a long time.  Check in with yelp and you'll get a free dessert. We were so stuffed we couldn't enjoy it there and were going to skip it but Michelle packed one up for us to-go. Again, she was super sweet and generous but she wasn't the only one... the bus boy never skipped a beat with pouring and refilling our water; super attentive and polite as well.  If visiting Red Rock, this is the place for a great Italian dinner."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday last night. It was perfect in every sort of way. From the food to the service, everything was amazing. I got the calamari for an appetizer with the cherry pepper aioli, it was great! For dinner I got the gnocchi's and let me tell you they are the best I've had! Then to top it off I got the Nutella lava cake for dessert with a candle in it to celebrate my birthday. Couldn't have asked for a better night thanks to the best food and staff at Salute."}
{"text":"This place was really good. Not the best Italian restaurant I've ever been to, but definitely up there and worth returning to. I don't know why all these reviewers complain about the price. I think it was pretty reasonable for a nice Italian restaurant - and not bad compared to Vegas strip prices. Wine selection was fairly good. Appetizers and desserts were really good. Coconut cake was amazing! I had the signature pasta. It's fun to order, but I probably won't get it again. It's kind of a simple, kids dish. My husband had the veal Marsala and loved it."}
{"text":"We were at Red Rock Casino to experience the new Star Wars movie and afterwards wanted a bite to eat, but nothing extravagant. We had dined at Yard House and Lucille's before but were in the mood for something different. After reviewing our options, we chose Salute.  We were promptly greeted and whisked to a table. The location wasn't great, but since the restaurant wasn't busy, it was a fine, very small, table for two in the middle of the high traffic, area of the restaurant. (Later in the evening, 2 servers drove by in rented, handicapped scooters...I guess it was the evening's entertainment?!)  Our server, Mike, was engaging and assisted us in making our selections. He assumed we wanted tap water but we ordered a big bottle of Pellegrino to start. We didn't order anything outrageously expensive or unique. We both wanted Caesar Salads ($10 each), to split the Seafood Risotto ($24), and 2 glassed of Sangiovese ($9 each).    The salads arrived and they were perfectly sized and delicious. We had to ask for fresh, cracked pepper and the server who brought it didn't know how to adjust the coarseness of the pepper. No wine arrived. Mike came to the table and said, \"It looks like something is missing. Didn't you order wine?\" We reminded him of our selection and he said that the bartender was opening a new bottle. Fine. We enjoyed our salads.   Our table was cleared and the entree arrived, split on 2 plates (very nice!). It was good. The Risotto was cooked nicely. The Calamari was tender and in perfect, bite-sized pieces. We each got 1 Shrimp, 2 small Clams and a few tiny Bay Scallops. The sauce was tasty but sparse. Still no wine.  Mike finally came to check on us and we mentioned the wine again. We promptly received 2 glasses. It was a nice wine but not sure that it was exactly what we ordered. We finished and Mike brought us our check. I was disappointed that the wine wasn't taken off the bill. I asked the hostess for Mike. He promptly came to the table. I diplomatically explained my displeasure and he quickly took care of taking the wine off the bill for us.   We tipped 20% in cash on the original amount because that's the right thing to do. We had a departing conversation with Mike and explained that we were locals, this was our first time here and that we would like to come back to try the tableside pasta."}
{"text":"Service was really excellent ! Presentation was good as well. The Calamari was ok and Chicken Parmesan wasn't that good. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"They treat staff poorly, and food was to salty. It seemed like alot of frozen food heated up in microwave."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 4 or 5 times. The first time I loved it. But my friends meal was poorly cooked. The next few times, my meal was cooked poorly!  My meatballs were raw! The manager came by and apologized and took care of my meal and gave us a free dessert.  This time my pasta was so undercooked even my server came back and said it wasn't aldente! But no manager.  After so many times I am thinking they might just make a great meal. The potential is there. But they are not. It is very poor quality and not even getting a visit from the manager after such a poor plate. They aren't caring to make it right for future service."}
{"text":"Very slow service from they kitchen.  I was asked to be seated at a table, as only a few were occupied. I was told no, we are at capacity.   Then they seated me at the bar.  Not sure what the difference was as I was still ordering food..  maybe they didn't want me at a table because I had shorts on.    I ordered veal parmesan, it took about an hour to be served. The veal was good, but it came without pasta or any side of any kind.  Not even bread.  In spite of knowing about the wait, the manager did nothing to address the issue.   Amanda, Jody, and Christina were excellent.  If I could separate it it, the wait staff would get a 5 and the restaurant a 1."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks very nice, staff is nice. But my pasta had too much pepper. I would have been perfect with a little less"}
{"text":"After waiting over an hour after ordering not to mention being sat, we were informed that Peter the Mgr on duty was not going to charge us for appetizers since our food had no eta with not even walk to personally apologize :(The server and assistant were on point. We were not dressed like the sons of very prominent real estate developers in the city we were but hey we also were not dressed like slouches. If your not an old stiffly guy with a black card or a celeb this place overlooks even cooking your meal much less offering a smile or two. If you got the name or dress like a baller then go, appetizers were great but over an hour an just \"hey you can go if you want\" is unacceptable when paying over $30 a plate... My only response to Peter the mgr listed below how are u trying to get my food to me, when we are being told that we should leave as it was not even started yet. I thank you for putting your face in front of such poor service that is undeserving of the price or venue for that matter..."}
{"text":"Our service was great, helpful for our first time looking forward to the new beautiful Italian place in Red Rock as it is one of our favorite casinos off the strip.  We were soooo disappointed with the food.  First course was an chopped antipasto salad that we added the salami & cheese to, it was so BITTER we could not finish it. It was mostly different kinds of chopped cabbage and the dressing was bland.  He ordered the braised boneless short rib special, while the hunk of meat was good & tender, the roasted potatoes were bland and mushy inside. No gravy or au jus anywhere to be found on the plate so the meat became dry as you ate it. Table side Vodka cream sauce pasta looked so good and I wanted to love it so bad..It tasted sour as all get out.  The meatballs were never browned and did not taste good. Change my order to the lasagna with out meat sauce since I don't eat a lot of meat.  This was also very bland.  Bread was mediocre to say the least it was hot when served.  The table of 4 next to us ordered their food and 3 of them were very disappointed except for the Chicken piccata.  One had the linguini & clams and said it tasted like buttered noodles, one had the truffle pasta and said it had no taste & the 3rd had the table side Vodka cream sauce pasta and said it was horrible, I was so hoping for him it was a better batch then mine. Nope.  Sorry we won't go back."}
{"text":"I had high hope for this one but sadly it wasn't stellar. We arrived Saturday at aprox 7pm and asked for a table for two.  The greeter tells us they are completely booked (we look around and 75% of their tables are empty, are you kidding me!?) and she will check for availability in the bar.  We sat at the bar. The service was fast and the bartender did their best at mixing the drinks. I had the seafood risotto which for $25, the amount of food was minimal, I mean I got 1 shrimp some clams and rice, not much. My husband ordered the truffle tagliatelle which tasted. He says he's had better frozen pasta than that. I was never offered complimentary bread.  There was a couple of guys sitting next to us and they got oysters which wasn't event on the menu. It seem the staff was more into pleasing them than everybody else. What am I chop liver? Terra Rosa had better customer service.  Lastly when we left the restaurant (45 mins later), 75% of their tables are empty (although they were completely booked).  They get two stars because my food was flavorful (small portioned; in fact it probably got stuck in my molar, because I was still hungry when I left) , and he bartender was able to make me a martini she has never heard of even though she didn't know the recipe, she did good."}
{"text":"Used to be a family favorite and now it's no longer...  Before reviewing often for Yelp we had come to Salute at least 5-6 other times. We all enjoyed the signature spaghetti which was made for you in front of your table. Fun little table side experience, kids loved it. Not only was it fun to watch them melt the cheese wheel with the torch, add vodka and mix in the pasta, it was extremely good. Tonight we found out that they have removed that dish from the menu and switched it with another receipt which was more like a fettuccine sauce which wasn't great and the meatballs were not cooked all the way through, needless to say, the family did not like it and asked if Salute would come off the family rotation for dinner outings.   Apps were good, get the crisp arancini, so yum, and service was decent. Not attentive at all but didn't have to look for our server either."}
{"text":"It's been a while since last time I had a bad experience at a restaurant and this time was beyond disappointing. Our food took over an hour!! The worst part was the fact that no-one seemed to care. Our server did not even apologize for the delay, he pretty much ignored us every time we tried to ask for our food. We also asked for bread three times and they kept forgetting until the 4th try! At the end they comped part of our meal. However, it's hard to remove the sour experience.   After such a disappointing diner it is very difficult to look at the good aspects, but I guess I will try my best.   Their signature pasta is toasted in a 3 year aged reggiano parmigiano cheese. The delivery of this dish is definitely unique. The taste is good, but is definitely not worth the bad service.   Unfortunately, there are so many good restaurants out there that it is not worth coming back again."}
{"text":"I've been looking for local restaurant with a strip vibe... And I finally found one. My husband and I popped in to get a quick bite before we hit movie, so we decided to sit at the bar. Chelsey was super helpful with entree and wine suggestions. We had the sea bass and spaghetti squash... Kept it healthy and light. We'll definitely come back to see Chelsey."}
{"text":"This ambiance here really makes you feel like you have left Las Vegas and entered Italy.  I recommend sitting on the patio if possible.  I always start with the calamari and a caesar salad.   The service is always attentive and great.  Parking is easy.  This is one of my favorite spots in Summerlin and always a recommendation."}
{"text":"I'm a very picky Italian foodie who insists on nothing less than the freshest and most authentic Italian ingredients. The best food I've had in my life was in the Amalfi coast, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany, and Puglia. I'd rather go hungry than set foot inside a disgustingly excessive, Americanized food trap and be served by a pimply, poorly trained kid called Todd who doesn't know the difference between San Marzano tomatoes and a hole in the ground.  I know, I know...all the typical haters are already yelling \"if you want real Italian food go back to ITALY!!!\"  Well I don't need to. All I need to do is come to this place.  (Do yourselves a favor and try the burrata.)"}
{"text":"I like their atmosphere. Interior is stylish and cozy with an architectural structuring method where no wall stands between standing columns.  Food is OK. Just OK. Nothing outstanding about taste. And their signature pasta doesn't have presentation anymore! My friend really wanted to see that, so she was so disappointed about it sadly. But their service is great. And I love their live performance. It was bravo!!! I should've asked singer's name."}
{"text":"We decided to try it out and were served outside. The restaurant is beautiful and the ambiance outside was great and so we were excited. Over ten minutes later we still half not been given menus, and literally over 20 minutes later we hadn't even met our waiter! Someone saw us looking impatient and we told them we had been waiting 20 minutes and they asked what we ordered, we told them we hadn't even ordered yet! At that point we left because we were trying to make a movie in time so we are elsewhere at red rock. He didn't ask us to wait a minute to speak to a manager to try to right things. We were very frustrated, especially because the food looked good and we liked the ambiance."}
{"text":"Terrible service killed this one.  Took FOREVER to get our drinks, then appetizers.   The entrees took so long I forgot what I ordered!  Seriously.  The food was not bad, although there were a couple of problems with some orders (overcooked steak, ingredient changes not followed).  But, it was the service.   Just terrible.   It's part of the Red Rocks Resort, so I assume they benefit from the \"captive\" audience somewhat.  Which is good since they prob would'nt last in the LV market."}
{"text":"Could not be happier with the experience we had this evening. Yes, it's a tad pricy for pasta, but the ambience, service and food quality all make it worth the price. It's a beautiful space, and since we went fairly early it wasn't crowded or loud. We shared the chopped salad, I had the tagliatelle bolognese, and the hubs had the lasagne. Both were among the best versions of both I'd ever had. Ordered a glass of the most expensive Italian red wine. I felt like the taste was off. Our sever took it away without question and brought me something different that was excellent. We don't go out for Italian a lot but we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Joseph made us feel welcome and gave us good service. I ordered pasta vongole, AMAZING!!!! And my husband ordered eggplant parmesan and he loved it.  It was not love at first sight when we came in but Joseph and his partner(sorry dont know your name) made our customer experience the best! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Salute over at Red Rock casino and was really impressed. I was a little concerned with how busy it was but I sat at the bar and even though it was hopping, my bartender, Nate, seemed to materialize whenever I needed my next drink.  Been to bars all over the world and this dude Nate is top 3 bartender easy. Good prices, great service and great mixed drinks. I had their meatball and pizza which were both way better than expected. Overall, great vibes at Salute. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was great but the service was a bit slow. We went to dinner with a total of 6 people. One guest got his food 5 minutes before the last person received their entree. I also feel as though they should have explained that the entrees did not automatically come with pasta.  All in all it was good, but could use some tweaking."}
{"text":"Excellent food, beautiful ambiance, superb service! Highly recommend this establishment for dinner when at the Redrock Casino! Nice happy hour also."}
{"text":"The worst italian restaurant I have ever been to besides Olive Garden. The san marzano, bolognese  and marinara sauces were extremely salty. The caesar salad was also salty. The portions are small and prices are higher than they should be. It took 30 minutes to get bread even though we asked for it 4 times. Service was chaotic. I give it a poor rating. The decor is modern and anything but Italian."}
{"text":"Would never take a party here at all. Was the worst sea bass I ever tasted. My other three friends got pasta and said Mac Shack has better pasta. Everything was overpriced. Even there well known desserts were no good. Our waitress and the cocktails were the only thing good but still way overpriced. Horrible restaurant. Would never ever go back"}
{"text":"I like that you are able to sit outside here. It's a pretty ambiance in front of red rock. I haven't eaten inside yet and have sat outside both times we came.  I love their signature pasta! If you go here it is a must get! I have been here twice and order it each time.   They light a roll of mozzarella cheese on fire to melt it and then stick the pasta in it to get it all cheesy. They then put it back into the bowl and serve it to you.  The first time it was my meal but last time we went we used it as an appetizer for the table (3 people) and it was just enough to leave my satisfied!  I then ordered a veal milanese \"saltinbocca\" which was veal chop, cheese and was breaded. It was huge! I feel like it could have feed four people. It was really good and the dipping sauce was good as well. Definitely using it for leftovers.  We had a free dessert coupon from checking in so we got the dessert platter. I wish we would have gotten the nutella cake because all the desserts on it would go with coffee and we didn't end our meal with coffee. But now I know for next time."}
{"text":"This is the first time dining here. We sat out on the patio next to the fountains and fire pits in front of the casino. Very nice decor. Service was very good. My husband started with the Caesar salad which he thought was good. For our enters I had the Salute Signature paste which was homemade fettuccine with a vodka pink sauce. There is a whole presentation with this dish where the pour the vodka into a huge, carved out parmesan wheel, light it on fire and then melt the cheese before stirring in the fresh pasta and sauce.  I added meatballs.  My husband had the Salmon Farrotto which is similar to a risotto dish. Both entrees were good but I preferred the Salmon dish. Piping hot bread to start."}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic addition to the Summerlin restaurant scene.  Sitting at the bar with Chelsea or Nate always makes for an amazing night of great service.  While the food runners Zeke and Rafael serve up tasty creations, and are always attentive and knowledgeable.  From the Eggplant to the ever so delicious spaghetti squash this place never fails to deliver."}
{"text":"Wonderful bar, with large food & wine menu; outdoor seating and very pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere were nice but but a little pricey.  Very tasty arancini rice balls and meatballs. Chicken parm was very good but it's a la carte to get pasta."}
{"text":"I realize that every restaurant can have a bad night but a recent dining experience here was one for the record books. First time for us at Salute since it opened. It replaced what we always found to be another very decent Italian restaurant in that space. Early dinner with parents. From ordering to table the entrees took the better part of an hour. Once it became obvious the waiter did his best to avoid eye contact and our table. Others around us also experiencing the same problem. That said, even when the meals came out we found them lacking in taste, presentation and overall value. Never an acknowledgement by the wait staff or management of the delay, just did we want to see a dessert menu - uh, no. Bill and out. Sad. In our collective and extensive experience dining out this was the worst experience any of us could recall. Lots of better Italian alternatives out there in our opinion."}
{"text":"I've ate here 2xs now and it's hard to reconsider coming back. The 1st visit was phenomenal! I had the truffle pasta dish with real truffle and my bf had their seafood risotto and they were both excellent. He said one of his best meals hands down.   My 2nd visit was my meal of the truffle pasta to go. I sat at the bar and said I wanted food to go and she informed me the kitchen was closed as of 20 minutes ago. As I was wondering of my next location to go, the cpl next to me offered their untouched food and I said thank you but I don't eat meat and they have an excellent truffle pasta here. The bartender was super sweet and over heard my choice and was able to have the kitchen prepare it as it's an easy dish.    The bartender was so kind to convince the kitchen staff to prepare my ToGo dish but also informed me of the quite large price increase on my pasta. It was originally $25 for my dish but now it's $25 with only truffle oil and extra  $15 for real truffle. Total $40 for the dish. I had an awful day and said yes I'll pay it so I could experience the full flavor dish. By the time I came home and started to enjoy it, it was loaded with SALT! I couldn't believe I spent  $40 on a pasta dish and was so disappointed! I feel like the kitchen added extra salt because it was a late order and what a crappy feeling after spending $40 for pasta with NO MEAT!   I'm down for spending money on a phenomenal meal but $25 is hard to consider now for a below average dish. My bf said guess we won't be going back anytime soon. Bartender was awesome though!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a few drinks and my fabulous bartender Chelsea made the best espresso martini! I would definitely recommend it and I will be coming back! Cheers"}
{"text":"We gave it a second try last nite and sorry to say nothing has changed since our first visit..Service still very slow, Im sure due to  inexperienced servers.They should have kept some of the ones from Terra Rossa.The food was good but the portions are way to small for the price.Its Summerlin,not the strip.Dont think we will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for my mom and I for her 50th birthday. We were greeted promptly. We waited only 5 minutes for our table. It took a while for our waiter to come to the table to offer drinks but we were happy once he did. I recommend the Bella vita Bellini it's delicious. We enjoyed the calamari appetizer. My mother had the clam linguini. It is very garlicky but good. I had to try the table side vodka fettuccine! It is very good! I added the meatballs but next time I wouldn't. I brought our own cake so next time we have to try dessert! Overall, a nice experience."}
{"text":"This place is okay. My wife and I were out for her birthday. She is a picky eater, but loves Italian. This year we just decided to not make a lot of plans and see where we ended up. She decided she wanted to head towards Downtown Summerlin, and we ended up at this place inside of Red Rock Casino. We walked in and sat down almost immediately, the place was nice but they have tables crammed in. We were at a small (emphasis on small) two top in the middle. The whole time we felt like we were in the way. The restaurant was not full, so not horrible, but I could only imagine if it was full. The server was nice. The food was pretty good, not great but good. They don't offer any kind of birthday dessert (not a big deal just letting everyone know), it was kind of a bummer though since we were there to celebrate. We decided to get ice cream elsewhere. Overall Salute is a decent place to eat, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Ordered margarita Pizza and came burned. Then waiter saw but said if everything was ok right even though he saw we didn't finish the pizza we left the burn side for him to see.Also Bread came old too- like that keeping frozen and then put in microwave.  Pasta came after one hour with frozen broccoli .Potatoes came dry.What a disappointment. The food was so much better when  they opened.what happened?  Must be the new Chef.Food tastes like is from the can."}
{"text":"To start off the service was good and the  bread was very good.  If Caesar ordered the Caesar salad he would have had the chefs head cut off.  Missing was the anchovies, lemon juice and garlic.  The squash flowers were stuffed with a cheese sauce so you could not taste the flower.  My gnocchi was good but the red sauce had too much salt in it. The clams and linguini tasted great but where are the clams?  Too few clams for $24.  The Salute Signature Pasta was a winner but not enough to rate 3 stars."}
{"text":"This was our third time dining here and most likely the last. They can't seem to get the food thing right. Positives: Good atmosphere with friendly and attentive staff.  Negatives: the Caesar salad absolutely tasteless. How friggin hard is it to make a good Caesar? The veal chop was overcooked and tough-too thin with thick breading and quite grisly. The chicken parm was average at best. It's really unfortunate to have a A+ looking place serve C- food. Wish they could get their act together as I like supporting the local joints."}
{"text":"We used to love this place but they have a new chef.  He changed their signature dish which was fettucine with vodka sauce.  They had this huge parmesan cheese wheel and flambéed it with vodka while scraping the cheese and then they added sauce from the kitchen and tossed the fettucine in it.  It was fantastic.  The new chef scraped it and uses a different cheese and the cheese wheel is about 1/3 the size which makes sense because I am sure they are not selling much of it.  Taste horrible and previously it was quite the show too.  Classic case of someone fixing something that was not broken, in fact it was better than not broken.  Stupid."}
{"text":"It was service was prompt and friendly service, nothing to jump and down about- dishes are all ala carte and pricey. Mushroom Risotto  was pretty bland and my veal Marsala was good but not worth $24, just meat, no sides they are extra...Happy  hr menu very limited, not really a happy hour place per sec the bartender...I probably  would not go back, unless I have a couple  hundred  to spend on dinner for 2.."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was terrible! Don't believe in the check-in For FREE dessert! It's a SCAM to get you in. First they said they'll honor it, then after we finished our meal, our server refused to honor the check-in. It's not about the dessert the principle."}
{"text":"My bf and I celebrated out 1 year anniversary here. The ambiance was great and servers were nice. The food good nothing spectacular but it was probably because of what I ordered. Hence, 5 stars for making our visit worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Salute last weekend and everything was EXCELLENT!!  We sat outside on the patio along the water and truly enjoyed the ambiance.  The food and service were great!  Stephen was our server, he took the the time to explain the menu and the specials.  He was confident in his recommendations and they did not disappoint!  We ended up ordering family style, the best way to order in my opinion.  We starting with the Tuna Tartar and Arancini,  yummmm.  The second course we enjoyed was eggplant caprese and a bowl of chickpea soup.  Delicious!  Main entree was the Porterhouse to share as well along with the Whole Roasted Fish.  We thought we didn't have room but Stephen convinced us to try the Tiramisu and we're so glad we listened!  Overall a gorgeous restaurant with a great atmosphere, delicious food and impeccable service.  Looking forward to our next visit!  Thanks again Stephen!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review due to how badly the service has gotten here. I don't know their names but the two female bartenders are rude and inattentive as well as for simple drink orders wrong. Short brown hair and the other a big blonde. You guys lost a family of customers because of this."}
{"text":"Salute is a new Italian restaurant at Red Rock casino. The food was excellent and the prices reasonable for the level of food/service. Unlike earlier one-star reviews - which read similarly, as if written by the same person with a bone to pick and include unnecessary and classless personal attacks on the staff - service at Salute was excellent, informed, and attentive. I expected shaky service, because of the aforementioned reviews and the fact the restaurant is new and that's the way things always are at new restaurants before the kinks are worked out, but was pleasantly surprised.  I had caprese, lasagna, and dessert. The marinara that topped my lasagna (instead of the usual bolognese) was fantastic. You can tell a lot about an Italian restaurant by the marinara. Here's a tip - on the dessert menu are individual desserts. For the SAME price you can get a dessert sampler with one of everything. Go with that. It's enough to share with 2-3 people. There's a pasta I saw another table order. Staff rolled out a cart with a reggiano parmigiana wheel to tableside, threw some vodka in it, lit it on fire, and tossed pasta in the well of the just-melted parmigiana wheel. It looked fantastic. I'll get that next time.  The patio outside is gorgeous. It's a great setting with waterfalls and rocks. At the right time of year, you'd never want to leave."}
{"text":"I first want to thank YELP and Salute for allowing me to be a guest at my wife's complimentary \"Yelp Elite\" dinner of our choice. The bread was delicious and diverse. The ahi tuna and crispy butternut squash appetizers were scrumptious. My wife ordered the 16 oz. veal chop and I the veal Milanese. As I ate my meal I was drooling over my wife's chop. The Milanese seemed over cooked and dry. The veal chop was the best veal dish I've ever tasted. I was jealous. We ordered different meals to not have the same thing. Never again. The Milanese definitely did not seem worth the $45 price on the menu as IMHO the chicken fried steak at the breakfast buffet at Red Rock was tastier. All in all the service was fantastic, the drinks were a nice size, the desserts were excellent, the patio ambience was wonderful and the entire overall dining experience was one of the best we've had here in Vegas since we moved two years ago. I can't wait to go back--probably try happy hour next and soon I gotta order that Veal chop!!"}
{"text":"Owned by the suddenly swelling \"Clique\" group, whose Hearthstone has become an across-the-street go-to for a great meal from a kitchen staff I trust, it was after several back-and-forths with PR that myself and a few friends sat down on the patio of Salute just prior to its opening - the service expectedly exemplary straight from the hands of Chefs Sautto and Massie while food proved both bold and well-crafted enough to book an opening-night visit with friends as well as family...or at least so it seemed.  No doubt a beautiful space, the interior long and shotgun straight with the left wall running bar to tiled kitchen to antipasti station as art and tiles decorate the walls, it was after a warm welcome at the podium that our party of seven was led to a large central table, greetings offered by everyone from GM Peter to Maitre 'd Enrico and Chef Luciano, the service from a friend an additional treat though Chef Massie apparently could not leave the pass or even be bothered to turn around.  Acknowledging opening night jitters, the majority a fault of completely lost back-servers and a bar that couldn't seem to keep up with a quarter-capacity crowd, it was after a short discussion with Chef Luciano that the kitchen was given carte blanche with a focus on pastas, 32 of the restaurants offerings sampled over the course of this meal plus a next-day \"Invite Only\" with results running the gamut from exquisite to decidedly mediocre with price-to-portion ratios a bit skewed to the left.  Already altering both the offerings and the costs from what was featured during the pre-opening taste, suffice it to say that some interesting items such as Osso Bucco Ravioli were axed in favor of far too many dishes centered on simple tomato sauces, the tableside Fettuccini delicious with a bit less sauce than what was featured prior while the rich Spinach Lasagna was delightfully decadent beneath Bolognese and creamy Bechamel.    Less successful with undercooked Carbonara and Truffle Tagliatelle that really has no business being served during the earliest days of Fall, a better bite is found amidst the Eggplant speckled Aumm Aumm or tender Linguini beneath blossoms and lightly bitter pesto, the Rigatoni no better than that from Michelina's while the meatballs atop spaghetti were damn near dehydrated while the larger ones served as a side were far more tender and less overwhelmed by spices.  Almost as overpriced on zucchini blossoms as Wolfgang Puck's CUT while the flatbreads at Hearthstone far outperform the pricey Pizza all' Acqua, a 'best-bet' appetizer is more appropriately found in tartare or crudo, though those not trending to tomatoes as primi will also be impressed by the lightness of fried eggplant, the secondi selections of Chicken Parm or Veal Saltimbocca obviously a bit more substantial with the latter wrapped around Fontina and smoked Prosciutto actually quite stunning.  Fairing well with the Lemon Chicken and what may very well be the best Piccata in town suffice it to say that the dry bomboli are a dish best skipped while Coconut Cake and Caprese Pie, both brought in from Peridot Sweets, are well worth ordering - as were the two celebratory cakes delivered for our family and friends outing.  ***At first looking like a place that may be interested in shaking up a stagnant Italian scene in the Western Suburbs it seems as though early on Salute has opted to instead play it safe, a bit of a shame considering the 'lightgroup' thumping music and prices not far off from those found on the Strip."}
{"text":"Salute delivers fabulous Italian dishes with a flair.  Salute has a colorful, crisp atmosphere which is lively with an outdoor patio by the water fountains of Red Rock Casino.  Stylish food presentations.  Pasta made fresh and from scratch with innovative recipes from the cuisine of Southern Italy. Be sure and order succulent table side prepared pasta.  Peruse the area where the olive bar is situated near the hostess entrance near the casino.  Sinful and jaw-dropping desserts.  The Nutella warm cake is a must have or is it the tiramisu or perhaps that limoncello!  99 percent of the time I 'situate' myself at the bar.  Why, no not because I'm a drinker...Nate the one with the friendly and inviting disposition.  He not only provides great banter, but exceptional service.  He knows that menu- go ahead ask Nate, Listen and order what he describes:) Salute offers a pleasurable dining experience.  That's why it's always on my rotation the last two years:)"}
{"text":"This is a very classy and impressive new restaurant with a great vibe and decor.   Awesome booths and nice outdoor patio, set off from casino by its own facilities. Staff seems very into it - Geely the hostess was terrific.  Nice job all around."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Salute three times and raved about the food and decor to friends.  My friends all wanted to try it after the great things I said so I made a reservation for 7 on the patio at 7:30 pm last Friday.  We arrived 10 minutes before the designated time and figured we would be told to sit at the bar since we were a few minutes early, but we are drinkers so figured that would be fine.  However, when we arrived, we were told that our patio request was more of a \"recommendation\" and that if we really wanted a patio seat we would have to wait approximately one hour.  Did the hostess think I was joking when I called ahead and made it specifically clear I wanted the patio? At no point was I advised that my request might be ignored.    Well Salute, that is NOT how you should treat a loyal customer, who lives within walking distance and who \"recommends\" you to others and returns with large parties.  I might expect such service from a place like Olive Garden, but with these prices and portions sizes I expect more. In the future, I will not \"recommend\" this restaurant to others.  I gave two stars based on the food I've tried in the past, the coconut cake desert looked way better than it tasted."}
{"text":"A great local restaurant to come to if you're in the mood for Italian! Everything on the menu is delicious and the restaurant has a beautiful ambiance."}
{"text":"Went into Salute last night with the intention of just having drinks, ended up staying for dinner. The food was AWESOME, some of the best Italian I've ever had! I got the chicken Marsala and my wife got the Farro Salmon. We also tried acouple of their specialty cocktails, our favorites are the \"Italian stallion\" and \"that's Amore\". The waitstaff from the hostess' at the door to bartenders and our server were great! Everyone was actually incredibly friendly and the vibe in there is also on point. Will recommend to my friends!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Ravioli with the Eggplant Parm as an appetizer.  The portions were very small on both.  The Eggplant was very good (but $15 only gets you enough for one person) and the Ravioli was just okay.  My favorite part of the meal was the large (included) bread basket with different breads and a dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Came here for my dad's birthday last weekend. Very deluxe feel inside. This is no olive garden.  Pros: all the food was amazing. The bread at the beginning was awesome. We ordered their pesto gnocchi special appetizer and it was incredible. Best part of the whole meal. Next time just order 2 of those and ask for a bunch of the bread and use it for dipping sauce. 3 of us ordered their specialty pasta and added some meatballs. The smaller meatballs are better than the one big one. Different meat I guess. I got the chicken parm. It was fine. Nothing to write home about. The cheesecake was some of the best I've had also. Oh yeah and their ice cubes are like perfect cubes. Seriously, order a coke or something just so you can get these ice cubes.  Cons: the cost. For 4 of us without drinking it was over $200. I'd rather go to magal for korean bbq twice instead for that cost. Also their Italian donuts were blah. Fried dough ball covered in like a pinch of powdered sugar.   Overall, great. For less money you can get better meals elsewhere but if you are in the mood to have a fancy Italian meal, this place is great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Salute this past Saturday for dinner because I realllly wanted to see them make their flaming vodka sauce pasta by the tableside! He made reservations for 7:00 pm, we arrived at the restaurant early by 10 minutes, and we were seated right away.   Then we waited and waited and waited. It took a good ten minutes before we were greeted by our server with menus and glasses of water. Though, to be fair, our server was stuck with another table and talking to them. Except, to be even more fair, she was a bit on the slow side.   We ordered burrata & prosciutto, salmon carpaccio, and their salute caprese salad to start off. Yes, the boyfriend was really hungry so he decided to order three appetizers to share. As for our main entrée, I got the table side salute signature pasta and my boyfriend got gnocchi alla sorentina.  Our appetizers came out all at once. It flooded our table because we were at a two seat table. Let me tell you ... we looked like fatasses.   The burrata & prosciutto had a very nice presentation. The prosciutto was nicely piled up on once side, the cheese was nicely balled up next to it, the grilled bread was neatly placed like dominos, and the balsamic vinaigrette was in a little jar with a spoon. It was beautifully presented .. however, I feel like it was a mess to actually eat. If the grilled bread was in smaller pieces, that may be better. Other than that, it was a really nice dish. I couldn't really taste much in the cheese though. They put lemon zest on top of it so that was all I could taste. The prosciutto was really good. You could actually see them slicing the prosciutto when you walk into the restaurant. I loved the balsamic vinaigrette...it was the perfect amount of sweetness to balance out the prosciutto's saltiness.   The salmon carpaccio was pretty much covered in lemon and tangy flavors. It was good but the tanginess can get overwhelming if you do not like that type of flavor. I LOVE tanginess so I did enjoy this dish. My boyfriend, on the other hand, didn't care for it all too much. You can still taste the fish underneath all of the tanginess but it isn't as prominent as some would like.   The salute caprese salad was already split for us, rather than serving it in one whole dish. The presentation looked really nice but a little different from how we normally see it. The cheese and the tomatoes were separate. They also sprinkled some pepper and salt onto the mozzarella, which is a little different. I sort of like this type of set up because I can control how much tomato to eat with my cheese or just gobble the cheese by itself. Hehe. However, the taste of their mozzarella is on the lighter side.  Now, for their table side signature pasta! This one is a special one. They have a huge block of parmesan, wheel it to your table, pour vodka in it, and set it on fire to melt the cheese. I've had something similar except they don't set anything on fire .. but Salute will set it on fire! It was definitely a joy to be able to watch it happen. After they melt the cheese, they pour the pasta that's been cooked in the vodka sauce into the cheeeese and mix it. Afterwards, they serve it on the plate for you. Great entertainment value! As for the taste... I gotta be honest, it gets a little mundane after a while. I think if they added something else to it, it'd turn out better. Also, the pasta that they use is out of the normal. The fettuccine is wavy -- I'm guess they make the pasta in house. I had the urge to slurp it like ramen noodles because it was wavy haha.   Overall, Salute is a nice place to dine in. It is a little awkward to me that it's sort of a fancy place inside a local casino. It just seems out of place to me. Not only that, the prices are a little on the high side. Then there was our slow server. Maybe it's just her haha. Bright note, if you gamble and have a players card, you can use your rewards points here! I wouldn't mind dining here again."}
{"text":"Being a 100% Italian (from Italy not from New York). Native. I must say NOT ITALIAN FOOD AT ALL. Quite far to be excellent.  The taste just not there, not sure how to describe, Bla I guess.  I am sure the chef is great, but my food was not cocked by him X sure. I can taste it, of course I was hungry and I ate it. No other choice.  The Prosciutto was great, but of course IMPORTED, sliced way to thick :((( The marinara sauce was great as well, not like that garlic Taste flavor (Italian food does not have much garlic or spices at all). And probably prepared by a the ONLY  Italian in the kitchen, the chef.  Service is super slow, portion are so so. I left hungry.  Desserts not that impressive neither. I had the tiramisu, a true disaster. I could not taste the coffee, nor mascarpone, or lady fingers, just heavy cream and lots of sugar.   I felt I was in a chain restaurant. Not in an Italian  Trattoria. I was over there X over 2 hours, and no one came even to say welcome or how was the food. Severs must be busy yes, but what about managers. Probably they are even scared  Because they donot know how to describe that Italian food. YOU NEED ITALIANS TO RUN THE SHOW. Sorry! My opinion of course."}
{"text":"I initially came here with hesitation because I only saw three stars on yelp. I am so glad my friends and I chose to come here before seeing a movie at red rock. I think this restaurant is outstanding! I am a foodie so it is a really big thing for me to love a place because I find, many times, that I can be overly critical as I've eaten at really good places internationally! We started off with the melon and prosciutto appetizer and the Buratta and prosciutto appetizer, both of which were just fresh and really yummy. We ordered an Argentinian Malbec bottle of wine that was extremely reasonably priced and a beautiful wine. We went on to order the Branzino ( fish) baked in salt. It was just lovely! We ordered sides of broccolini and  rosemary potatoes. They were equally delicious. For dessert, I ordered the coconut cake and my friend ordered the tiramisu, which is their house specialty. The tiramisu was out of control! It was so ridiculously good. The coconut cake with mango sorbet was just lovely and light. We had coffees to go with that and the coffee was really good. The service at this restaurant was better than service at many restaurants and so it was simply outstanding. The ambience of the restaurant is really nice and relaxing. We are so going back and highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves really good, fresh, and light Italian food."}
{"text":"I thought I wrote a review but I don't see it. I loved the bread they served! I felt like I was getting full off bread.. I wasn't impressed with the appetizers, fish or pasta dishes but the desserts were all great! My entire party was excited for the cheese wheel barrow but we were quite disappointed because it was bland. The salmon tasted better than the sea bass."}
{"text":"you gotta try this place. best chicken parm and pasta in town.  rigatonni with cherry tomatoe sauce to die for.  try the italian stallian, an italian margarita to perfection.  service is great here.  staff is on the ball.  strongly reccommend with establishment."}
{"text":"Service was horrible!!!!! We ordered with no issues at all, appetizers came and were very delicious. Before all of us were finished servers came through and took the appetizer plates and silver wear away. Then we waited an HOUR from that point until the main dishes arrived. Serval tables were complaining, servers were avoiding tables. The food arrived, I ordered the chicken piccata with a side of spaghetti, the chicken was covered in overly salty sauce that you could tell it was sitting for a while because there was a filmy layer on it. I ate one small piece out of 3 and complained. Then my side dish of basic spaghetti was under cooked, very al dente. Out of my table 2 people out of 6 liked their meals. Management was not helpful and disappeared for a while. They took the appetizers off the check but I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Usually when at Red Rock I dine at T-bones which is excellent!  But we had a vegetarian in our group and thought italian would have more options as far as no meat dishes.  First thoughts- loved the atmosphere... vey chic and warmly decorated.  The service was exceptional, Kerry was our server but all of the employees seemed happy to be there which was nice.  There were 3 of us and they sat us inside at a huuuge booth big enough for a large party.  Kind of weird... but whatever.  We ordered Moscow mules which seemed to have too much ginger beer and hardly any vodka.  Between the 3 of us we had the caprese salad, zucchini flowers, linguine vongole w/ clams, cheese raviolis, and the signature pasta with a meatball.  The caprese salad was very good and fresh tasting.  As far as the rest ... we were not impressed.  The cheese ravioli sauce tasted like it came straight from a can.  The signature pasta was ok.. just ok..but the the meatball was pretty good.  The linguini vongole was very bland.   Overall all the pastas were all lacking in flavor.  We were not impressed.  Did not live up to my expectations.. 3 stars for the great service and cool presentation.  Sadly, probably won't be returning here.."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this new restaurant to see how it compared to the previous Italian restaurant in the space.  Definitely a different vibe but still good other than the snooty hostesses.  Both young girls gave us a bit of attitude upon checking in with a reservation.  We were a bit early but there is not reason to be rude to paying customers.    Once we were seated, we were fine.  The waiter and the assistants were very attentive, also checking on us, refilling waters, taking empty plates.    We decided to save room for dessert so we only had entrees.  I had the chicken piccata and mom had the pasta Bolognese. We got some nice warm seeded bread with oil & vinegar while we waited for our entrees. Mom wanted butter instead so they got here some right away.  Our food came very fast, almost too fast.  But it was delicious.  Nice portion sizes.  Chicken was nicely cooked, good piccata sauce.  Mom's Bolognese was yummy.  Good chucks of ground meat, nice tomato taste.    For dessert, mom had the strawberry gelato and I had the mango sorbet.  We both enjoyed our flavors.    Definitely a good place to try again.  They have a nice looking bar at the end of the restaurant and an outdoor patio that will be nice in warmer weather.  Now if they can just make the hostesses less snooty."}
{"text":"Spent Thanksgiving here with my father and my daughter. It was magnificent. The only thing that I could complain about is that the steak knife they gave me was almost as sharp as a dull spoon, but other than that it was perfect.  The noise level was low, the staff was incredibly responsive, the presentation of the food was great. The desserts were fantabulous. From top to bottom a world class establishment. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Took a chance and tried this place out last Saturday night. Made a reservation on Open Table and they easily accommodated us on a holiday weekend. Upon arrival our hostess was very friendly and gave us a nice booth big enough to accommodate four but there was only two of us. That was fine with me as I enjoy sitting in a roomy booth. The dining area is really pretty and calming. Although we did not sit at the bar, it looked like a place you could sit and enjoy a nice cocktail before dinner. We were greeted promptly by Brandon and he quickly brought us water and took our drink order. We viewed the menu and both of us ordered the gnocchi. This is a dish which I find to either be really good and or really bad. I enjoyed a mediocre caesars salad as side. As for the wine by the glass, what a let down!  I originally ordered a glass of Sangiovese, and my friend opted for a glass of Cabernet. When I tasted my wine, I immediately sent it back. I consider myself to be a pretty good judge of wine and this just didn't measure up to many other Sangiovese wines I have enjoyed in the past. Brandon was understanding and brought me a glass of the Cabernet. Once again, not real tasty but I drank it anyway. I understand that a lot of times when you order by the glass, the wines are usually not the greatest but their list is truly a disappointment. Ok, on to the food. My gnocchi was ok, a little too much sauce and not a lot of flair. My friend ordered the same dish so I have no additional opinion to offer on other dishes. We did order a sample plate of their desserts which came with biscotti cookies, sugared donuts in a nutella like sauce and a delicious sorbet. We could not finish the whole thing so I brought it home for the family. I cannot complain about the service. It was extremely on point. From the waiter to the bus boys, everyone was hustling and keeping people happy. If I return, it would be because of the service."}
{"text":"We live close by from this place and we like to try different restaurants around us. My husband and I had dinner here 2 nights ago to relax and distressed from our busy schedule. Unfortunately, our server isn't too nice to us, we tried not to bother us so it wouldn't spoil our night. He was rushing almost to take our order and have a bit of an attitude, not friendly at all. He might be having a bad day that day or something but this place isn't a fast food or cheap place to eat. The food was okay, nothing special about it. But, the wine (pocci) we ordered that night was really good! We tried talking to our waiter about the wine and how pleased we are with our choice and he just brushed us off and said \"are you ready to order??!\" He got friendlier towards the end when we are about to pay. I wonder why? Hoping for a good tip perhaps?? For this experience, we are not coming back and have told our friends about it too."}
{"text":"Ate here because it's new and we were anxious to try it. Service was outstanding. I read the opposite on some of the other reviews... so not sure if management is really cracking the whip now...but we were hardly left alone for a minute without someone asking if we needed anything and were always asked if we were enjoying everything . Dishes ordered were the Pappardelle Bolognese, Veal Milanese and Albacore Crudo. Yum, yum and yum. Very impressed. Portions are not large, but typical fine dining size, which we prefer. They certainly may have had some opening missteps in the recent past or some servers that didn't work out. Happens to new restaurants a lot. We did not experience any of that. Our server was Chanel and she was awesome.  We thought the food was exceptionally good. We look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"We have a new winner in the Italian food category. From beginning to end this was fantastic. We started with the chopped salad. Not a ton to rave about here but it was good. My wife had the Chicken Piccata. She usually doesn't order this in a restaurant because it usually doesn't stand up to mine. This one did. I ordered a first for me, Branzino. They will serve this whole, filet or filet with skin on as well as Grilled or salt baked. I chose fillet with skin on. I fully expected to remove the skin. Nope; The skin was crispy and the meat was mild and perfectly cooked. It comes with a very light, pesto like sauce. For a side we ordered the spaghetti squash with marinara; so good. We decided to also go for desert. We had the dark chocolate pie with gelato. Food orgasm worth the 9 dollars. With a glass of wine and tip, 120.00."}
{"text":"Hit and miss maybe its flaws are it can be a little inconsistent.. In my opinion, in Summerlin there is not too much better than this place for an \"upper scale, feeling lazy not wanting to drive all the way to the strip but wanting the strip feel\" pasta place, it is an upgrade from the previous Italian restaurant formerly in the same location(Terra Rosa)  When this place is good, it can be really good, but the odd time you can order the exact same dish as the time before and it come out not tasting the same or even look the same as the prior visit  I like it, i give it a 3.5 stars, Vegan/Vegetarians.they DO have \"vegan friendly\" pasta (made without egg, just make sure you ask). If you are from out of town and find yourself staying in the Red Rock, i do recommend it as one of the best choices on the property -Ambience is modern and great!"}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago for Their Family dinner promotion with my wife and kids. It was a great deal at $60 for all four of us. It was definitely enough food but we had to order the arrincini & some desserts. The coconut cake is too good to pass on. We will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"Save your money or spend it elsewhere. This place is very pricey for what you get. The food isn't terrible but it's not great either. Simply put it's just not worth the price. I gave it two chances. The first time I got a pasta and I'm just as happy with that pasta as the jar pasta I make at home. The second time I got fish. It was pretty good but the serving size was so small that I went out to eat after eating it. Overall, it's not bad but you can definitely go to a lot better places for the same price or cheaper."}
{"text":"So hopeful, but so disappointed.   The food WAS good, however, there was a large bone in the middle of my chicken Parmesan, which I've never seen before, and did not care for. The risotto had noodles throughout it, which I've never seen before, and did not care for either.   You can search, but you may never find a single smile on any of the wait staff's faces. Good luck.   It was so flippin' loud inside the restaurant that you really can't carry on a conversation with anyone at the table other than the person directly next to you or across from you. There was 6 of us, so it made it very annoying.   The water boys, bus boys, even the male manager on duty, we're all extremely attentive to the two ladies sitting at the table next to us in tiny dresses, fake lashes, big lips, etc... While we waited and waited for more water, and our empty dirty plates sat ignored for 20 minutes. Thanks for making us feel invisible because we didn't dress like Julia Roberts from Pretty Woman. Fail!"}
{"text":"Salute consistently delivers excellent dishes. Italian at the heart with a classic Americana spin. Portion sizes are generous but not overwhelming.  All of the sauces we had gotten to try from the various entrees were incredible, they do indeed make the dishes. My party of 3 sat down at one of the booths available. They were busy, but not overcrowded and seemed to keep a very good pace of seating guests. Our server promptly greeted us. Since it was our first time she introduced us to the menu and familiarized us with the nightly specials which were available. I was looking for a great Italian wine to pair well with any red sauce dishes. Our server recommended a bottle of Barolo, Cantine Giacomo Ascheri, WELL worth it and highly recommended!  All the courses we had were amazing. Antipasti we ordered were the Arancini, Burrata and Prosciutto, and the Calamari. All of which were to die for, and if I continued eating could easily make a meal out of them.  Our delightful server let us enjoy our appetizers then recommended a few entrees which we shared as well so we could taste each one. We had Chicken Parmigiana, the Porterhouse (great for not being a steakhouse), and my favorite.. the Lobster Fra Dia'volo. Oh my goodness.. absolutely fantastic. And of course we had another bottle of wine brought to the table. After all, an excellent meal calls for excellent wine.  We finished the second bottle of Barolo for our desserts.   Very Highly recommended. Enjoy your time, don't skimp out on trying some dishes. They have a happy hour but I recommend trying the full menu."}
{"text":"As if I haven't been reporting on enough Italian restaurants in the past five years, I've been on a succession of never before visited memorable Italian ristorante dining adventures lately, so I'll keep the reporting streak going in the next few days with observations about other establishments serving my favorite cuisine: Italian fare, both veal and all manner of pasta.  First up is Salute.  Here our party of four had dinner reservations, but arrived early and were delayed in getting seated.  Then there was another delay in receiving our menus.  Once they came, everything turned around, and we enjoyed a great Italian dining experience.  Caesar Salad was excellent with Creamy Parmesan Dressing and Focaccia Croutons.  Veal Marsala was fork-tender, and very colorful gooey and cheesy Eggplant Parmesan tasted as good as it looked.  Lasagna with Spinach Pasta, Tomato Sauce, and Bolognese Gravy was excellent, and crispy roasted Rosemary Potatoes with sea salt and Parmesan Cheese were hot and simply delicious.  A table mate's Baked Rigatoni Bolognese glistened from nicely melted cheese and was described as very good.  My entree-size Eggplant Parm was one of the best I have ever experienced, and because it is largely composed of a vegetable, one can feel less guilty about eating this cheesy but meatless concoction.  From the time we ordered, service was spot on.  The chef himself brought my entree to the table.  The ambiance was sleek and modern, with all white dishes.  Rousing, thumping piped in music provided a pleasant backdrop.  Initially our server forgot to assemble two separate checks, but quickly recovered to comply with our earlier request.  I will most definitely be back to sample other fine Italian dishes served here!"}
{"text":"Beautiful ambience, great service and delicious food. My husband and I really like their spaghetti squash and the grilled vegetable platter.  It also has a nice wine list of all price ranges."}
{"text":"This is one sexy Italian restaurant! It has the look of the modern Mediterranean with Gorgeous lighting that sets the mood. The waitstaff is attentive, warm, and knowledgeable.  The bar has a cool cocktail program naming drinks like \"Italian stallion\"and \"that's amore\" !The dinner menu is thoughtful offering traditional Italian classics and new creative dishes as well.  Some of my favorite items were zucchini blossoms ( a hard to find item), eggplant parm, spicy lobster spaghetti and well I truly enjoyed steeling bites of my boyfriends handmade pasta alla vodka with huge meatball made table side, they literally set a wheel of cheese on fire! The server made great recommendations and it was a nice touch that the manager stopped by and asked how we were enjoying!  Oh yes and just when I thought I couldn't eat anymore - dessert! Don't leave without trying their cannoli's.  Looking forward to return!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our first anniversary in Vegas this weekend and we wanted to try something off the strip. We went to Salute at the Red Rock casino. Our server Misho was great, attentive and professional, he recommended the veal saltimbocca and my husband had their signature pasta, Misho also has recommended a perfect bottle of wine and it paired perfectly with our food.  I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This place is inside the Red Rock Casino. We were a party of 8, and they were able to get us in right away. It was a busy Saturday night, too.  I noticed that the servers seemed spread thin and didn't feel like they could devote a lot of time to their customers. The waiter that was assigned to our table barely smiled. Maybe, he was just tired. He wasn't rude or anything, though.   The food presentation was excellent! My son had the salute signature pasta where it was served through a flaming spinning cheese bowl. Kind's like the Lawry's spinning bowl salad. I had the salmon and my husband had the veal parmigiana. All of the ordered food tasted good and served with right portions. The prices for each entrees is a little bit high. Overall, not a bad place if you're looking for an Italian food with good ambiance."}
{"text":"Salute has a beautiful ambiance! It's A classy modern Italian restaurant inside a casino with the added benefit of great pasta! It's just extremely pricey for the food that you get.   The signature pasta is impressive and they cook the cheese sauce in a big wheel of parmasean next to the table! It smells divine :)  I had the Salmon w/ rissoto and it was good, but nothing to write home about. I also tried the fried zucchini flowers, which were just glorified mozzarella stick, but came with this amazing pistachio pesto sauce that made the dish worthwhile.   Service was good, nothing special, but no complaints either.   Overall, a very solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great place to spend your time with a loved one! Or good company perhaps! Lovely service here and great prices!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! My mouth is watering just leaving this review. We had reservations and were quickly checked in and seated. The restaurant is BEAUTIFUL. Tastefully done without being overwhelming. Our waiter came to our table and introduced himself within 60 seconds. After going over the specials of the day we asked for recommendations. Our waiter explained all the pastas that are made in house and invited us to take a look at their antipasto display. We settled on all of his recommendations. The antipasto was so fresh. All the meats and cheeses were fresh and so flavorful. We followed that up with a meatball appetizer. It was big enough to quarter and share with the couple we were with. Had I know how good it was, I might have ordered one for me and not shared. Next we had the caprese salad. The mozzarella literally melted in my mouth. For dinner I had the Truffle Tagliatelle (also suggested by our waiter), it was to die for. We had a round of Limoncello, which we were informed is made in house. Last, we all shared the Nutella cake, coconut cake, and tiramisu. Everything was perfect from beginning to end! I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Fresh mista salad with flavorful veggies and fennel. Enjoy the bar and friendly service from Nate. Nice to take a break from the casino and breath some fresh air outside."}
{"text":"I loooooooove red rock. Never have a bad time there. I usually spend my time batting away the countless ex-Hawaiian tropic models hitting on me at the various casino bars. But last Friday I decided I wanted to have some carbs (once a month whether I need them or not). Well I chose salute as my conduit to carb load. I sat down at the bar the and was happily greeted by Nate. I told him... listen player... I don't need some slight of hand... I need some stiff vodka and waters and some serious Italian food. \"My pleasure he says\". He serves my drink and I order. He recommends the veal saltimbocca. So after Dinner and several drinks later I can say PHENOMENAL experience. So phenomenal my uber driver asked me \"politely\" to talk about something else (driver will not be getting 5 stars). Will repeat!!!"}
{"text":"Reading prior reviews I was a bit skeptical on eating here, but to my surprise it turned out to be a great evening. I would recommend reservations as we were seated immediately on a Saturday evening. If not there can be a wait. The service was perfect, very knowledgeable and friendly server. The food is on the pricey side and portions are less then average but very very tasty. Just a tip if you go to Yelp to read reviews you can get a free desert coupon which they honor. I would return again to try other items on the menu."}
