{"text":"Awesome service, SNAP is a life saver when you need something and have no car. Ive ordered through SNAP quite a few times and I can say they always come through with great service!"}
{"text":"EDIT- for whatever reason they could not fulfill my super easy order on friday evening. Some lame excuse about the line being too long...uh I'm pretty sure thats why you charge a $10 fee...for your inconvenience to do the thing I don't want to do...not using them again. Shame




TIL that I can have McDonald's delivered.

Yes, it was THAT kind of wednesday. Slightly hungover (ok...a lot hungover...getting old sucks man..) and anything beyond getting up to occasionally put my finger down my throat was not even an option. In between bouts of nausea every time I looked at my phone I decided to google mcdonalds delivery; because I just knew that if delivery of a mcdouble was possible, it would most likely be in downtown Toronto. I first came across the delivery McDonald's website which just didn't seem legit...I think my total was like $500 or something absurd. then...

I F*CKING FOUND SNAP.

within 45 (sorry but this is necessary) f*cking minutes I had a really pleasant man meeting me int he lobby with McDonald's. I didn't catch his name so i'm calling him Jesus. Its happened. The second coming of Christ works at snap delivery and will bring you McDonald's. Or any damn other thing you want. for a $10 flat fee. 

you are all f*cking welcome."}

{"text":"Snap Delivery is an extremely convenient option for students living at York U and the surrounding area. Every time we've dealt with them they have been extremely pleasant, friendly, and professional. They offer great value for their service and whenever there is a problem (restaurant doesn't have what we ordered, might take a bit longer) they always get us an additional item for free or try to make it up to us in some way. This is a great initiative for students and hopefully it will catch on as other students learn about this. They also accept debit and credit which is great, and they are very prompt with their delivery.

Probably best of all, it is 24 hr service, which is great since my partner and I often work shift work late at night or we don't have a lot of time to cook. We will definitely be using this service in the future and highly recommend them."}
{"text":"So; it's like 10pm and you're in the York U area; probs in the village right? 

And you're starving? 

Yea; Snapdel's got you covered. 

A couple of weeks ago; I came to my friend's place in the village where I basically also live part time and its the usual : 11pm. 

Friends: Abbas, what are you going to cook for us?

Me: Um, its 11pm and I'm not sober.

Friends: Fine, let's order from Bamiyan..

Me: Since when does Bam-Bam deliver (Sidenote: I call Bamiyan Bam-Bam)

Friends: Well we got this flyer about this delivery service

And since then, we have been in LOVE.

Its super convinient; super friendly and super fast service,

Basically, you call the number or go to the website (which could use some work, but whatever) and place your order, and they deliver within 45 minutes.

They can take all forms of payment too, so cash or cards are accepted.

We usually order from Bamiyan (which is open till like 11ish) or McDonalds (24 hours), but they do a lot of ther places too

THe driver's a nice guy, and lately he's been braving the horrible weather for us, so I definitely wanted to give him a high five for that.

Love you Snapdel!

PS how many colons have I used in this review right??

Sidenote: A few times we've ordered from Bamiyan and they have missed and item or whatever and they've always gone back and picked it up again for free."}
