{"text":"Delicious fresh food and great service. So excited to see this new restaurant in this plaza. Cute, clean little place and Tottie is so friendly! Their panang curry was perfect."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!  They have a scale of 1-7 for hotness/spiciness in the food.  We always go for 5, sometimes 6.  It's always consistent and spicy but also flavorful.  My favorite dish is the Singapore Noodles.  Perfect every time and enough for 2 meals, at least."}
{"text":"Have now been twice.  Both times very disappointed with the food, and paid more than I would expect.  The spice level was inconsistent.  Flavors were not so tasty for crispy chicken, totties noodles, and dragonfly noodles.  Egg rolls were not good...very generic.

Not a fan at all and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Soooo happy this little gem landed smack dab in my neighborhood!  Their traditional Tottie rolls are AMAZING, as is their green curry.  My husband loves their chicken chow mein.  They give you your choice of \"heat\", so even my 85-yr-old mother has become a Tottie's fan.  It's healthy, Delish and close to home with friendly, welcoming staff.  Oh, and they deliver!!! Hope they stay forever!"}
{"text":"My fave thing to eat and make are fresh spring rolls. And I admit that the rolls here are even better than the ones I customize for myself home. The soups and papaya salad are also A++."}
{"text":"So glad we now have real Asian Food in the neighborhood. This place is legit, just had the PHO and it was awesome. Can't wait to go back tomorrow and try the Orange Chicken."}
{"text":"I often stop by the Paradise Valley location on Scottsdale Rd for Pho and other delicious meals. I was working in North Scottsdale and heard about the new location & decided to try it. Same great food same friendly people! The location is geared more for takeout with only about 10 small tables for dine-in. If I lived closer this would be my #1 choice for takeout!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place. It was great!  I had the Chiang  Mai Noodles and my wife had the Crispy Basil chicken.  Great fresh flavor. We really enjoyed it. Can't wait till they get beer and wine."}
{"text":"Because of the good reviews and photos on yelp we stopped in here for dinner. 
We order a variety of food and all of was good. 
My complaint would only be that the dishes could use more meat. 
Shrimp puffs were good and the beef pho was good.
Loved the egg roll, loved the pad kee mao with shrimp!! 
We also had a lunch combo of some Thai chicken and it was yummy! 
We will definitely choose to eat here again when we are craving Asian food!! Probably ask for extra meat when ordering though."}
{"text":"Quaint hidden away gem in neighborhood shopping center. Awesome service and fantastic food.  I love the curry dish, some of the best I've had.  Give it a try.  Steve is a great host."}
{"text":"I order from here the other day and loved it! The pho and egg rolls were very good, especially on a raining day. The fact they deliver to my house is even better! Will order pho from here any chance I get."}
{"text":"A nice addition to Tottie's other 2 restaurants. Casual & quick service. It's a treat to have Tottie herself at this location. The menu is spot on with all our favorites. What a treat for north Scottsdale to have this new option. The Shrimp Mango salad is amazing!"}
{"text":"Really really fresh and tasty. Try the Singapore noodles and say hi to the friendly staff. 

Hybrid fast food / sit down kind of vibe in smallish digs."}
{"text":"The food was good, however I asked for something that I did not receive.  Do not say u will get something for a customer and then do not, due to lack of staff."}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese take out my family has ever had. The chicken and beef was so dry. Every plate extremely spicy. AND to top off 2 dishes - fried rice and egg rolls (smallest portions) was $62. I can't believe this place has any stars at all. So disappointing."}
{"text":"My wife and I spent the night in Scottsdale and wanted Thai. We looked on yelp and decided on Tottie's. Best Thai food we ever had. Great friendly service. We plan on going back whenever we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out because of all the great reviews and it's near my house. We decided to eat in to experience the food when it was just freshly made. The gentleman at the front was pleasant. He brought our drinks, serving plates and silverware before the food came. My date found \"something floating in his chai latte and I didn't give much thought and said must be the tea leaf. He said \"probably\" but never drank out of it. I didn't drink my chai as I found it to be too sweet. 

Before the food arrived I noticed the utensils were not well washed, so I inspected the plates too. Out of 4 plates only one passed the visual \"cleanliness inspection\" others had dried out specs of food on them. When I asked for them to be replaced, the man at the front went to the back to get me some new clean plates, while I opted out for some disposable chopsticks. He went through several stacks of \"clean\" dishes on 2 shelves, and ended up pulling out mini plates from entirely different stack (not dinner plates). I couldn't get into the food, had few bites and was wondering what else is in that kitchen not up to the standard of the \"clean code\". I feel like it was a waste of money and we ended up ordering take out at a different restaurant. 

I asked my date if he found his tea too sweet as I did, once we got in the car, he replied \"I didn't want to gross you out at the dinner table, but the black spec was not a tea leaf\"  you get the idea...

Just writing this review and recalling the experience and the fact that I ate there makes me noxious."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the service was great and friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant. I had the Red Thai Curry Panang with chicken- very delicious !!"}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, I found a new spot!  As you may see from my profile pic, I'm a big handsome man, and Asian blood is running through my veins.  I love Chinese food and MUST eat it several times a month.  As you can see from my reviews I do enjoy Noodles and Rice, Nee House, and occasionally Wang Express in my area.  Sometimes I would even succumb to Pei Wei or PF Changs, if I'm desperate enough.   This place Tottie's Asian Kitchen is legit.  So my brother in law recommended this place to me, and he's sampled many of their dishes and like's it a lot.  Considering he's Persian, I took his advice with a little skepticism at first, but the man sure was right.  It's not every day a Persian man recommends an awesome Asian place to a Chinese man.  Ha, sorry Sam.  Let's jump to the review.

This place is located off Bell and 64th street in a strip mall.  The place is small, but had a cozy feel to it, about 8 tables or so.  They have an extensive menu which offers a variety of dishes, from appetizers, soups, Thai & Vietnamese, noodles, and fried rice.  My wife and I ordered the Tottie rolls, Panang Curry and Crispy Thai Chicken.  All three dishes were delicious and flavorful, and good healthy portions.  The rolls are similar to Vietnamese fried spring rolls and served with lettuce and cilantro.  The Panang curry was amazing.  It had a lot of vegetables and beef in the dish and the curry sauce was awesome over the white rice.  I asked for it to be spicy and had a real nice kick.  My wife enjoyed her dish as well.  The crispy chicken was tender and had a real nice batter to it.  She was impressed as well.

Overall, pretty solid place.  I would add this restaurant to my rotation of good Asian places in the area.  I think of it very similar to Noodle's and Rice off Cactus and Cave creek, but a little more expensive and bigger portions.  My only knock on this place is, it's a little expensive for their dishes, but the quality of the food was noticeable."}
{"text":"Oh my God! This place is a treasure. I found this place actually on yelp, and turns out it is very good. The food is authentic and very spicy- how I like it. I have been to a number of thai restaurants and this one always makes me feel complete. You can rate you're spice  by number one through five. The owner is really nice and always makes our dishes how we want. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I got 5 pieces of beef with my Pad kra pao dish take out!!  This is ridiculous. And it was $13! What a rip off."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Tottie's Asian Kitchen. Quaint and cozy environment. Family-owned, great service. Very authentic and fresh. I ordered the Dragonfly Noodles, which were out of this world. Highly recommend it! Also the freshest spring rolls I've had in a long time. I'll definitely be back here."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location; I've been to the other two Tottie's locations in Scottsdale.  I was most excited to have the hot and sour soup, only to find it wasn't on this menu!  So the group of us decided on: pho w chicken, pad thai (which I special ordered to be all veggie, no bean sprouts, but it came w beef and sprouts-bummer), Tottie's pan fried noodles, and an order of bok choy.  On the order online, I requested to add soy sauce and sweet and sour for four people.  We got two soy sauces for four people.  But, the food was good...all of it was really good!!  The pan fried noodles were great, LOVED the bok choy, the broth for the pho was delicious, and the pad Thai was decent once I got all the sprouts and beef picked out of it.  Because I usually love this place, I'll be back, but I really hope they remember to check the special order option in the future!!"}
{"text":"Decent food and decent atmosphere!  Just be careful of the curry, every time I eat it it gives me the runs.  Just and FYI, not sure what they put in there curry but I have been ok with curry from other places."}
{"text":"Service here was off the hook!  They do have a hot meter, but manager brought over additional hot sauces in case we wanted to \"spice\" the dishes up to our liking.  Had fresh spring rolls and they didn't disappoint.  Also had Panang Curry and Pad Thai.  Very generous portions and authentic flavors.  Great for take out too!"}
{"text":"I've had the panang and the pad thai, both of which were fantastic! It's a very small spot so takeout is great though you can absolutely grab lunch there. Thai Hot(at least when I had it) was truly Thai Hot, I was wrecked for a day or so but it was worth it. My wife ordered the Pad Kee Mao and enjoyed it very much. The portions are huge for the price, glad that it moved into the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Something has changed... this used to be one of my FAVORITE places and we would eat here weekly.  In the past few months, it seems like some of the recipes have changed.  The shrimp puffs now have bits of green in them and the consistency of the filling is lumpy rather than smooth and creamy.  The Panang is still decent, but every other dish that I've tried to rotate through has been disappointing.  We keep trying it in hopes that it will get better again and that we've had a fluke experience, but it doesn't :(  

It makes me sad.  I want the old Tottie's back!!! :("}
{"text":"50 dollars worth of disgusting food. Ordered a dish with shrimp got chicken. Wonton soup terrible. food terrible. Awful awful awful. Egg rolls were burnt. Awful food. Super disappointed"}
{"text":"Food sucks! I drove here from Chandler...what a disappointment! My food was burned and it was dry. I do not recommend this place. Go to a real Thai restaurant! Sigh!"}
{"text":"The food is very good and fresh.  The portions are big too.  A nice little gem.  If you want a great tasting healthy meal give it a try."}
{"text":"There hasn't been a GOOD local Asian food place for a while. Most of them all taste the same and everything is fried first in the same oil, or so it tastes. The food is very fresh, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I've been here twice now and between the different things we have ordered as a family, I have yet to find d something that wasn't not just good but delicious. The place is small and the decor is nice. There are different types of food, Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai and a mixture.

Very happy to have this place so close to home. No longer are the days of those crappy little folded boxes  filled with heartburn and every item tasting the same.

Good job guys."}
{"text":"I wouldn't if I were you. The food is absolutely horrible and expensive. Bland, soggy crab puffs, the shrimp tempura had more tempura than shrimp. I'm not sure it even had a 1/4 of a shrimp. No rice served with the curry. The best part of thr meal was thr fortune cookie."}
{"text":"I heard good things about Tottie's, so we decided to check it out while staying at the Westin Kierland for the weekend.  I ordered the beef chow fun and my husband ordered the shrimp fried rice.  Honestly, the food was just good, not great - a little tough and not a lot of flavor.  I was also expecting a sit down restaurant and was surprised to see it was a counter to place your order and they would deliver your food to the table."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. The order was easy to place. The delivery was fast, the service was good, and the food was delicious! I work in the area so I'm really excited about having a new Chinese spot around. I had the green Curry from their lunch special, and it was great. I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious spring rolls and lunch combos. Friendly staff. Great for lunch or dinner. Free delivery within a few miles."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money on their food. The beef and chicken they use in their dishes is precooked so it has no flavor and is dry. If you are charging $15 for Thai fried rice it better be good but no."}
{"text":"Order Totties on Ubereats last night and all I can saw is WOW! I was shocked by how incredibly tasty my meal was! I literally could not stop eating it! I will be ordering Totties again this weekend. I need more!"}
{"text":"This isn't far from my residence, but ordered through UberEats. The food was great! I love Panang Curry and it was perfectly spiced and they let me customize some of my vegetables. The portions were generous. I will order again."}
{"text":"Picked up supper. Orders and paid with the Yelp app which was easy and quick.  The spring rolls with peanut sauce was phenomenal. Great food and ready quick for takeout."}
{"text":"We loved this place!  It is located in a small strip mall, but once you enter the restaurant, you will see that it feels cozy and is decorated beautifully.  You place your order at the counter.  The gentleman helped us choose and let us pick our level of spiciness--from 1 to 7.  Although it was dinner time, he allowed us to choose from the lunch menu.  The food was delicious, and my husband, who has visited Thailand many times, gave it a double thumbs up.  The portions were large and the level of spiciness was perfect.  The restaurant has a relaxed, family atmosphere and is very reasonably priced.  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this because I keep trying to find some authentic Thai food up north. Unfortunately it didn't quite hit the mark for us. We tried four things (but one item in our to go order turned out to be the wrong thing).  

Good:  The green curry was spicy and not bad. Heavy on coconut like it could have simmered longer maybe but still not bad. The Pad Thai with shrimp was ok too. I'm used to wider rice noodles and some egg in there but this had thinner noodles with an array of cilantro, bean sprouts and cabbage on top. Light on the peanuts in general, very generous portions. 

Not so good:  The other two dishes - a chicken basil dish and the Bok Choy (which was supposed to be spicy eggplant) were way way way too heavy on garlic. Thai food does not prominently feature lots of garlic so it was really out of place and made the dishes bitter. You could see big white cubes of it all over the dishes. We ended up throwing most of those two out. 

Finally, maybe this is a tiny thing but I just don't want to get fortune cookies with my Thai food. It seems to suggest that either they think - or they think I think - all Asian food is the same (or even related at all to the American fortune cookie invention).  While I have nothing in general against a nice crunchy fortune cookie, I love Thai food and the Thai culture too much to make that mistake."}
{"text":"Little Restaurant in dying little strip mall on the corner of Bell & 64th St. 
Just went there because of the 4 star review. 
Staff is very friendly. You order up front at the counter and seat yourself and they bring the food to you. 
Portions were large, taste was ok. I think the lettuce had seen fresher days and it was a little limp already which turned me off. 
Unfortunately I don't think I will be back... there are too many other & better choices in the area."}
{"text":"This a great local spot to get your various fix of Asian cuisine. Just slightly pricier than other spots but it is worth the extra dollars (AZ tends to be more pricey than the neighboring CA when it comes to ethnic food).

I highly recommend the Chiang Mai noodles and the Papaya Salad as they are as good as it gets in this state. Pho is mediocre okay, but again, you should be here for a Pho fix and not a planned Pho trip (go to Mesa if you need some good Pho).

The staff here is friendly and very pleasant in every aspect. Owners are always there and they are hands on with the kitchen."}
{"text":"We have a couples night out, we went to the fusion, and the food was very very delicious, it was a normal atmosphere, and the prices are very reasonable,"}
{"text":"I would never recommend this place. The food is awful, tried ordering an entree that was supposed to be spicy, it wasn't. Asked to see if they could add anything to it, they said I had to take it as is. Asked them to take it back after one bite, they wouldn't. 

If you are someone who likes spicy foods please don't waste your time. If you're someone who doesn't want any seasoning for your Thai food then this is the place for you. Very bland -plus bad experience. Cost me $11 for a meal I didn't even like."}
{"text":"Said delivery would be there in 35 min. It's an hour now and counting.  They just called to clarify the address which they had wrong.....not off to a good start! The wonton soup was great! Shrimp wontons chicken greens and veggies. The chicken curry ok w lots of
Veggies and fairly light. Will try again!"}
{"text":"I don't know how there are 4/5 stars here! I tried two dishes (Pad Thai and the Fresh Spring Rolls) and my family members tried two additional items (Panang and fried rolls), and we all agreed this was some of the worst Asian food we've had. Bland sauces, mushy chicken, overly sauced Pad Thai (even though I ordered it with the sauce on the side!). And did I mention the chicken bone, and what I can only explain as grains of sand, in my Fresh Roll?! Just... yucky :("}
{"text":"I have only ever ordered spring rolls and pho here. This is one of two of my absolute favorite pho restaurants. The service is great, the place is clean, the soup arrives piping hot accompanied by the usual mung beans, basil, and lime. They also include the sweet dark sauce, plum sauce I think and Sriracha sauce. The broth tastes homemade and has the perfect blend of spice flavor, they are quite generous with both the noodle and meat portions. I dine in almost every week and can tell there are a number of regular customers which is a good sign. 

They have different Asian cuisines to choose from so it looks like there would be something for everyone who dined there. 

A bowl of pho and an iced tea is about $12."}
{"text":"Nothing particularly special here.  They cook up a variety of Thai inspired noodle dishes and dish out decent servings that are good for takeout.  

We went to the good ole classic Pad Thai for our first order, which was perfectly bland, filling and passable.  It's not half bad when spiced up a bit with the sauce they give on the side.  

As a second dish I picked Chiang Mai noodles, which is basically just a standard curry that has rice noodles mixed in versus being poured over rice.  Again, kinda bland and the veggie selection wasn't authentic in the slightest.  Felt like a curry designed by and for bland white people.  At least I hope that was the intent..."}
{"text":"This place is great! Calm, inviting and clean atmosphere- wonderful and quick service (the owner is SUPER friendly and takes awesome care of you) and the food is delicious! Good portions-we got the Pad Thai and Tom kha- and the soup is HUGE! You'll definitely want to share :) we will absolutely be back! Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Normally when I visit Thai restaurant for the first time I order Penang curry. Since for a Thai restaurant I think making good Penang curry and Thai tea is very important. So I ordered Penang curry. To be frank, Penang curry was not as good as I had at many other places in Phoenix. However, my colleagues order other dishes and as per their review all dishes were good. Also, this place medium spice is equal to less spice. Piece of advice: So at this place if they ask you spice level on the count of 7 and if you can handle medium spice at other Thai places then ask for 6 rather than 4. 

I might visit this place again to check out other curries with spice level 6 and see how it goes next time."}
{"text":"First time here!! A little bit of food, dry rice not much flavor to the food , and 28$ plus tip. I just ordered for pick up and wasn't expecting it to be 28$ for only one person meal. I feel like I was over charged but oh well wanted to give it a try. Got home and it was a small plate of food. Dry rice and not much flavor. I won't be going again."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would have. I used to eat this place on a regular basis for my lunch breaks. I have gotten food poisoning twice from them and took a co worker here and she has gotten food poisoning as well. sad thing is all 3 times something completely different was ordered. The staff is wonderful however the food is a complete let down. the first time i got sick I ordered the Shrimp Panang and told them to take it back because the shrimp basically were raw, they told me they would re cook them well it comes back out and they re almost raw again. mind you this is a dish I get normally and hadn't had problems with before. The second time I ordered a Shrimp egg foo young mistake again, the food was nasty on top of making my stomach hurt. i gave my left overs to a friend since my dish was basically $15 dollars and didn't want to waste it she complained of the same thing. The 3rd time i ordered King Ka Won dish (green curry) on 2/21/17 I get chicken to avoid the whole fiasco of shrimp again, thinking maybe its the darn shrimp. WRONG!!!!! I asked the waiter before he went back and placed my order could the chicken be grilled or deep cooked to avoid having food issues. he tells me its all pre mixed in they just add the vegetables and boil it? I'm confused because i was told before this dish was made fresh. Since I am in a hurry to get my food and get back to work i try it, my coworker orders some green beans and broccoli in garlic brown sauce with steamed rice. We BOTH ended up with food poisoning from this place! Worst part was the owner was there interviewing someone, I wanted behind to try and mention the issues with her menu as I before was a beloved customer for their lunch specials and was disappointed i have gotten sick eating at her restaurant. i was not able to verbally speak with her, but let the staff know they would be receiving a very low review. Long story short DO NOT eat here they do not cook and handle their meat properly and you will probably get sick."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed Tottie's several times now, and keep coming back for the excellent flavor! Hooked on the Green Curry & noodle dishes!"}
{"text":"Perfect flavor and amazing service. The individual dishes taste like they supposed to and just because it's Asian fusion doesn't take away from each country's speciality. We liked the interiors also."}
{"text":"Love, loved their location on Scottsdale and Lincoln so was very happy when they opened this one. This is not a sit down type restaurant like the other one, more like a take out but just as fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Every time I come in the same guy (I assume the owner) is there. He is really friendly. The food is good, fresh ingredients.  Great place to get a quality meal

4 stars because the building is lacking and the food can be a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I got the beef chow mein combo for $10 and it was delicious. The noodles, veggies, and beef were fresh. The portions are medium sized and it fills you up really good. I would highly recommend this place. One more thing to add, this place is across the Dutch bros."}
{"text":"I can summarize this up easily, dang that was good!!!! That's what myself and kids said when we walked out.

Fresh and good quality food. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I only gave this place 3 stars due to a couple of reasons. First the prices are pretty steep around $10 or so for one meal. Second the food quality is mediocre. Expected more fresh taste, home made flavors from the place being a small facility. At this visit we tried the sizzling rice soup, it is large enough for 2 and the price about $10. The broth was bland adding the hot sauce made a difference. We also had Kung pao chicken and chow mein with beef. The noodles were dry and needed more flavorful sauce. The meat was ok. Will probably not g back, will probably not go back."}
{"text":"Amazing little restaurant with quality ingredients! This place doesn't look like much but don't let that fool you! The flavors are great and the service is friendly! Modifications are easy (to accommodate my peanut allergy) and the level of spicy is flexible based on how you're feeling! I recommend the Chiang Mai Noodles. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Went here in the attempt to have lunch the other day.  I had read good reviews on Yelp and was really looking forward to a good meal as we were very hungry.  The minute i opened the door I smelled something funny.  My husband smelled it too and we looked at each other, turned around and left.  It smelled like a toilet had backed up.  I will try to go back another day and hope they have the problem resolved."}
{"text":"I have a severe weakness for Thai food - well lets get real, I have a weakness for any form of Asian Cuisine. I love how they just somehow make all of those interesting and complex flavors work together to marry into holy matrimony.
So lo and behold the other day when I was yelp-stalking new businesses in the phoenix area this little gem pops on under \"Hot & New\". I was giddy with excitement and knew this was going to have to be explored in the very near future. That moment was Friday evening after a long week of work, I knew my tush wasn't leaving my couch that night other than to pick up some yummy food to-go and a bottle of wine! 

This joint is about as hole in the wall as one could possibly get - like most awesome Asian/sushi restaurant's this joint meets all the criteria for awesome hole in the wall food. 
1) It's located in one of the most random Strip malls in the area
2) It's teenie tiny - maybe 10 tables
3) They don't have a website
4) Family owned and run
5) Treat you like family service

The curries were out of this world - I still can't get over the amount of shrimp that was in my Panang Curry and the chicken in the green curry. Spice level was on point too.

The only part that I didn't love was the Chicken Dumplings - They were a little over cooked inside and out. But I am more of a fan of steamed dumplings and these were fried so I think it's just a personal preference.

I can't wait to try more from their menu!"}
{"text":"What an awesome meal! The green curry was so good it brought tears to our eyes. Tottie convinced me to try the Dragonfly Noodles which I sort of expected would be boring and bland, but boy was I wrong!! They were fantastically delicious! So rich in flavor with so many delicious veggies, but still delicate because of the cellophane noodles. So good! And she does NOT skimp on shrimp! That's the first shrimp dish I've had in a long time where there was actually protein left over after the meal. Can't wait to have more tomorrow morning!! 
The ice cream desserts are all homemade and AMAZING! No jokes. This place is legit Thai! We are THRILLED to have you in the neighborhood, Tottie!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place so bad because it's so convenient, but both times I ordered this is very much below average food.  Your typical Americanized \"Asian\" food.  Very disappointing and over priced to boot. 

Last time I called the owner/manager was so rude on the phone, I cancelled my order and will not be back."}
{"text":"The workers and food were fantastic. I have little background with Vietnamese food but this has been my favorite. The speed, atmosphere, and quality easily deserve a 5 star. I recommend the panang with level 4 spicy."}
{"text":"We tried Tottie's for carryout last night and it was delicious! The packaging was perfect, everything wrapped up well and neat. We ordered egg rolls (4), beef panang and pad thai, asked for it mild and they delivered. I was really impressed. They don't have the liquor license yet, but are working on it. As soon as they get it we will definitely be joining them for a meal in the restaurant. Great neighborhood addition!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pho ever!!! Little pricey but it's so work it ! I have the beef pho and I added chillie oil and Suracha and hoisen sauce . And some lemons ! So so tasty ! Best pho I've had in az and trust me I've been on a search !"}
{"text":"Finally, after 18 years in this food desert-an Asian restaurant that is like being back in San Francisco! Pad tai with shrimp that almost made me cry-chow fun that was REAL chow fun! Not someplace that thinks big noodles is enough-my only wish is BBQ pork like they have in the windows in SF. I know you have limitations serving in a place like Arizona but now I have a dream and hope! Thank you Tottie's-I will be back! BTW-this was a Grubhub delivery order so I did not actually go in the place-doesn't matter-they could be serving out of a trunk and I would still place my order!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and the environment is comfortable and clean. The portions are huge. A good find."}
{"text":"So EXCITED this opened up here. When we were going to South Scottsdale more often we went to Tottie's all the time. Absolutely love it! But life changed and we haven't found ourselves in the area very often as we live in North Scottsdale.  I also love that this new location is designed to be able to stop in quickly to pickup. Love the food, everyone should try it!"}
{"text":"Well, sad to say but this place has gone down the drain and I can't imagine it will be open much longer.  Menu is now limited and VERY expensive for what you get.  The dinner/combo menu is no longer.  I ordered Orange Chicken and white rice.  Simple right?  Wrong.  The chicken is like popcorn and the rice is mush.  Oh well.  They had their run.  This spot is jinxed as no business survives longer than a year.  Being next to Arena doesn't help."}
{"text":"I might only go a 3-4 if I were in NY but considering were in North Scottsdale this is as good as were going to get and I don't mean that in a bad way.  The owner is very nice and friendly, the decor is nice and modern but not overdone.  It has a good vibe to it and the food is great, especially for the price.  If you are regular of FLO's or Tealight Cafe (the only two decent Asian food up north) then this place should be #3 on your list.  Fast, clean, friendly, and good food.  I have tried other area Thai food and generally the cleanliness of the store and service overshadowed decent food.  This hits all the major marks.  Try them out."}
{"text":"Mahalo Yelp again for bringing us to this new hot spot in North of Scottsdale and close to our hale. 
Nice and quaint little place, family style, feels welcoming when you come in and the owner she is sooo pleasant. Such a beautiful soul she has! I've only been in Arizona for a few days and missing my island food is something I am going through at this moment especially coming down with a congested cold isn't fun! But, stumbling on this place through Yelp was a wonderful idea! 
We had the pad Thai beef and curry chicken with steam rice. The dishes are very tasty and onolicious.. I really enjoyed all the items we had and the owner was very very pleasant and personable! They even have the mango sticky rice which is a rare commodity back in Hawaii so when she said she had that my face lit up and my chin grew big! Gosh, I was in heaven when I took my first bite... It was YUMMERZ!!! Now I know and now I'll be back!!! lol"}
{"text":"I love this menu and the service is the best. I feel like family when I eat here. The spring rolls are the best I've eaten and my entree is always super tasty!"}
{"text":"First time here and will be back for sure. Wife had pho tai. My kids had pho ga, and I had the beef chow fun with a 3 for spice. 

Everything we had was delicious and the boys loved their \"noodle soup\". The spice in the chow fun was just enough to feel it while still being enjoyable. If you're really into spice you probably want to go a little spicier. 

Very friendly staff and quick service. The only thing I was slightly disappointed in were the egg rolls. While they were good the price is a bit steep in my opinion. Price on everything else felt fair for what you are getting."}
{"text":"Discovered this place a month or so ago and I've been back nearly a dozen times since. Best Asian food in Arizona. The owners a great guy and I love supporting local owned restaurants."}
{"text":"We came here in a Sunday evening. My wife was craving pho so I started searching for pho in Yelp and lo and behold found a place by home. Don't get me wrong but I really wanted to like this place. It's in my neighborhood and I want to always see businesses in my hood to do good. 

We walked in and wasn't sure what to expect but it's decorated with an Asian theme. Small place with about eight tables. You walk up to the counter to order and the menu is on the wall.  They bring your food to your table. Place is so small they remember who ordered what. To be honest with you, this place is an Asian takeout place. Sitting here for our food, I noticed that 85% of their business is takeout. So just remember this when coming here. 

We ordered the traditional spring rolls and it comes with shrimp and pork inside. It was okay. Not trying to be critical but honest, the pork was a little over cooked. Their peanut sauce is warm which is different. I love to just soak up the spring roll in the peanut sauce. So it was okay. 

I ordered the Dragonfly noodles with beef. They have a heat scale of 1-7 with 1 being no heat. The noodles were okay. Not great but just okay. Again I thought the beef was a little over cooked and the noodles didn't have a lot of taste but I could taste the heat. So I did eat it all up but just okay. 

My wife ordered the Singapore rice noodles. LOL she was craving pho but changed her mind after seeing the menu but that's her choice. It came with pork and Shrimp. I thought it was pretty good. Not bad. Pork was cooked perfect and it had a pretty good taste. 

So the guy taking our order was really nice and patient with us. Just feel really bad for those guys. They had two working the kitchen and the one guy taking orders. They even give you free delivery if you want. Funny thing is the guy taking your order is the same guy delivering your food. So they were under staffed on Sunday. When they delivered our food to our table they apologized for taking awhile for our food to come out. They just said that they were being slammed tonight. Understand. 

I will try them again. Second chances are always good. Thinking that they were so understaffed could be a reason for the food. So I will try again. Also, my son tried this place and he loved it. Gave it a superstar rating (he's really picky). So I will give it a go again"}
{"text":"Ordered Pad Thai, fried rice, spring rolls and egg drop soup...was great! The \"spicy\" pad thai definitely had some heat -- and we love spicy. Would do medium next time. Also the egg drop soup had chicken in it -- wasn't expecting that but it was good. Might ask next time if we could order without."}
{"text":"The Chow Fun noodles with shrimp are outstanding. This little Asian restaurant reminds me of my favorite place in China Town, San Francisco.  Liking forward to going back."}
{"text":"It's sometimes hard to trust hole in the wall Asian restaurants,  but believe me (I am a foodie) this place is good! Plus, the customer service is great. The guy who owns it, I don't know his name, but he is there almost every day at the cash register greeting everyone making sure everything runs smoothly. My good has always been amazing. Try the sesame chicken!!!"}
{"text":"Tottie's has a menu of standard Thai favorites, for $10-$11 at lunch and $14 at dinner. I had the lunch combination, which you can order any time.  I enjoyed panang curry with chicken and dining companion had stir fried vegetables with chicken. Flavor of the curry was excellent and vegetables were crisp. The leftovers were just as good. The stir-fried vegetables however were overcooked and drowned  in  brown gravy.  About half a cup wasted limp bean sprouts were left at the end of the meal. The owner and his kids provided friendly service even though you order at the counter, and fill your own drinks.  I think the price point of $10 at lunch is a little high for the casual style of this restaurant, however the quality of ingredients and preparation is high, and the portion is generous.  The Asian Decor is cute but the lighting is bright, maybe they turn it down at night. It is, after all, a take out joint with 8 tables."}
{"text":"Very tasty, large portions! The reviews are accurate. 

Picked up dinner for family to go and all were happy. Glad that this is just a few minutes away - we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great little local place for different types of Asian foods...Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese...Food was delicious and plentiful for a good price. Thai ice tea was yummy! Will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"Ordered via Uber Eats and were delivered one of the most divine Panang curries I have ever had. While tracking the order on my phone, I noticed that the food being prepared was taking a bit more time then usual but the result was outstanding. The Panang curry, one of Tottie's Asian Kitchen's most popular items was tantalizing for the taste buds, super fresh, with tons of chicken and vegetables...thank goodness there is enough left over for tomorrow's breakfast. Super impressed and no real need to visit the restaurant when I can get such high quality delivery. Thanks !"}
{"text":"After waiting 55 min for an order that was quoted at 30-35, they just called to inform us that we are supposedly outside of their 30 min radius for delivery. However, according to Yelp and Google maps, we are 13 min from their location.  Unprofessional and rude."}
{"text":"This is a delicious neighborhood Asian restaurant. Their sizzling rice makes my mouth water just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Never complained before but decided to treat myself,and left choice to friendly host,specifiaing  n o t  spicy,got to go go pad Thai with shrimp,under the shredded carrot,cilantro,red cabbage was fire hot soggy whatever dug around and ate the shrimp,too afraid to go back."}
{"text":"Great Pad Thai and friendly, reliable service. We've ordered from here a few times, both take-out and from Uber Eats. Each time, the food was consistently delicious. When taking out ourselves, the service is fast and friendly, with staff even calling back once to confirm part of the order...much better than showing up to find it wrong and having to wait!"}
{"text":"Get ready to pay inflated Scottsdale prices for this little hole in the wall place. It's clean, friendly service and portion sizes are big. You can also choose your spice levels from 1-7. But, the food is mediocre at best and it's expensive. Paid $51.91 for 3 people for lunch with one appetizer to share and no drinks. I'm only used to paying these prices at upscale restaurants not at a place where you walk up to order. 
Pho had bland broth. The pad Thai had good flavor but the beef was really tough...almost like beef jerky. Panang curry was just okay. The 4 spring rolls with lettuce and mint was $9.95. Wow! I'm used to seeing it for $3-4 at other Phoenix restaurants and $7 at the Tea Light Cafe (Scottsdale). I would pass."}
{"text":"We've ate here a few times and it's been inconsistent. We always get the pho. Sometimes it's really good with normal portion sizes and sometimes we get very little noodles, only one kind of veggie, or bland broth.  This is the first place we've ordered pho from in the area so we will continue to find a good/ consistent restaurant with pho."}

{"text":"Small restaurant with no more than 10 tables and family owned.

Everything is numbered so you can just say which number you want.

We ordered the #10 sizzling rice soup, #23 Thai Green Curry, but requested it to not have any heat at all, the cashier thought he was funny and said what you want it hot, #28 - Totties Pan Fried Noodles and #36 - Totties Fried Rice. 

The Sizzling Rice Soup was pretty good and would probably order again. The soup included shrimp, chicken, baby bok choy, cabbage and mushrooms with puffed rice to add in add the sizzle.

The Thai Green Curry was good except the base was at a medium heat rather than the no heat as requested, almost from the cashiers remarks when we ordered was liked he purposely made the curry spicy.  It was almost not tolerable by my family of the medium heat. Very disappointed. 

We ordered the Totties Fried Rice and Totties Pan Fried Noodles which I expected by having their name on dishes to be their signature entrées.

The Totties Fried Rice was pretty good with a combination of chicken, beef and shrimp. 

The Totties Pan Fried Noodles when came out, the noodles were too hard and the brown sauce was separate from the noodles, beef, chicken and shrimp. It was actually better the next day when the noodles soaked up the sauce and blended with all the other items.

I so wanted this place to have excellent food but the dishes we had, 2 of 4, were disappointing. 

I believe it was one of the owners/chef, could have been Tottie, that came out to talk with us and I asked her about the curry when she told the heat was at medium, I told her it was too hot and she said the leftovers would be diluted to a more mild temperature which she did when I tried it the next day.

I would go back to try other dishes, the gentleman at the counter by his actions and the way he treated us, almost by himself made us not want to come back. His inability to have the curry turned low and when we try a new restaurant we order a few items and he scoffed at us and said we ordered too much. 

I hate to rate this now but our first time there was not impressive."}
{"text":"Really loved how nice and clean the whole place was. James was very helpful and had a great welcoming smile and energy. Their menu was pretty awesome! Lots of variety with some Chinese dishes, some Thai, and others Vietnamese. The Flavors were bold and delicious which is something nice to experience!"}
