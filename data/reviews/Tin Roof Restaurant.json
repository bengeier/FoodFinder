{"text":"My boss had our 2010 staff Christmas dinner here, there were just three of us for dinner, service was ok, I ordered a Singapore sling when our drinks came to our table I went to take a sip of my drink there were not one but four fruit flies! Easy thing to happen in a restaurant we have all had fruit fly problems lets face it! They had a nice menu offered I ordered a roasted chicken with vegetables the chicken was cooked in a white sauce can't remember what the sauce was but it was over all a great presentation of the food... As f the flavor it was flat but decent. I most likely won't go back it was way to over priced for the quality of the food and drinks and service but I have heard many good reviews on tin roof so maybe they were just having a \"bad\" night."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Have lived in Bradford for a few years and always wanted to try this place.  Saw the ad for Bradfordlicious and figured it was time.  Service was dreadful.  Sat for quite some time before we were offered bread.  The tables around us had bread baskets with oils and spices.  Ours was just bread.  That was long gone before our appetizers showed up.   Another long wait for our main course.   I received the wrong meal and the waitress responded with 'shit sorry'.  The meat/fish portion was good and warm but both of our sides were ice cold.  As bad as it was, we were done our entire meal including dessert before the table next to us finished their salads and they were seated before us.  Well at least I can cross this off the list of places I should try.  Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Short menu BUT everything we ordered was A1! Brushetta, Caesar salad,  Australian Surf & Turf (lamb & prawns),  Fish of the Day (was Basa) was great too. Customized pasta for the kids - butter & parm ;) Only suggestion I would have is to warm the plates in the oven before plating the food. Table service was great too!"}
