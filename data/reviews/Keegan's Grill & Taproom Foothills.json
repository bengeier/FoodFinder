{"text":"I love Keegan's and have been going here for years. the food is amazing and the staff are always really nice however they changed their menus and got rid of some of the great dishes. I loved the angel pasta and the burgers but they don't have it anymore!"}
{"text":"On Friday I visited this Keegan's at 12:30 pm.  Our service was excellent and so was the food; served exactly how it was asked for.  Even the French fries were hot and fresh, not something made 15 minutes before, but as if they were made because I, personally, had asked for them.  Imagine that!"}
{"text":"Ignore the people commenting/comparing this to bar food. This is not bar food. It's a restaurant that has a bar. It's not a bar that throws chips on a plate and tops it with nacho cheese from a can. It's not a bar that microwaves frozen chicken strips. It's not a bar selling red baron pizza.   Last week ordered to go; Spinach and artichoke dip- excellent but small portion Firecracker shrimp tacos- a lot of shrimp. i made 3 tacos and then gave my husband 4 shrimp Fish and chips- 2 large portions of perfectly breaded, thick cod.  I've been eating at Keegan's for 20years, the food is the same now as it was then, excellent."}
{"text":"Lisa was ridiculously friendly, giant burgers (cut them in half to eat), quiet atmosphere outside, clean accessible restrooms, and great beer. I'll DEFINITELY be back here. The only downside is that if you're in a wheelchair you have to eat outside because they're booths have a bar under them blocking access, and their tables were all allocated for private parties."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered the wagu burger. Yum, yum, and more yum! Food was great, service was great, and the lunch menu is very affordable."}
{"text":"Came here for my brother's fianc√©s birthday and was a real poor experience. For starters, after being carded, the waitress stared at her birthday without a single happy birthday. Not the kindest but ok. We then ordered artichoke dip for starters which was served with Safeway salsa, a small ramekin of watered down dip and delivered with 8 chips for $8.  The drinks, were really not good and our waitress forgot half of them which we had to remind her of. Twice.  The entrees were good but after everything else, we had had enough of this place. Plenty of other restaurants in Ahwatukee, go to any other.    Summary: Way overpriced for what you get. Rude service and watered down drinks. Save your money"}
{"text":"Went there last night. Very nice dining area a good food. They also make great Margaritas!"}
{"text":"Probably the best grilled chicken sandwich I have ever had! This was my first time to try this place, and I will definitely be back. Good service, not a loud place, very enjoyable. My only complaint was the fresh fruit side - it was indeed fresh and tasty, but all it had was pineapple and grapes. I would have liked to have some melon in the mix, or kiwi, or something, although I do realize that melon is much harder to keep fresh in a restaurant environment. All in all, I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"Our food was great. We had the Calihan salads and were very pleased.  Everything about it was perfect, even the amount of dressing already in there. Service was good too. Overall happy with our dining experience."}
{"text":"Had the potato skins and sliders for happy hour.  Potato skins were tasty (cut into 1/4 size and loaded with toppings) and sliders were very juicy.  Great happy hour prices and decent selection of discounted appetizers.  Service was very quick but rather lackluster."}
{"text":"First time here, It's social hour the potato skins were awesome and the beers are cold! They have a nice happy hour menu. Service was very good and the food was good I had the French dip and my boyfriend had the turkey cranberry sandwich both were tasty."}
{"text":"Only because we can't give \"0\" stars. The WORST waitress ever. She slammed the menus on our table because she didn't like what we ordered. NOT. EVEN. KIDDING. The manager was afraid of her. Rather than risk having her spit in our food, we canceled out order. Never to return."}
{"text":"I lived nearby for years and never visited.  Then on the day I bought a new house, we celebrated by going to Keegans.  I am so upset that I did not make it before.  We arrived after peak hours on Saturday.  There was still business in the place, but it was quiet.  The bar area was full with folks watching a sports game on TV.  The happy hour specials were actually a value.  The menu was different than other places around town.  I had the fish tacos and it was great!  This was during lent, and there were a lot of non-meat dishes for my wife to choose from.  We enjoyed our trip there and now I am kicking myself that we didn't go before.   I will definitely make it a point to stop in if I am in the Ahwatukee area and need a place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Very odd dining experience.  Our first and last visit to Keegan's was memorable in all the worst ways.  I will attempt to be concise here but truly it was...a lot to take in.  The hostess was not attentive, didn't get anyone seated quickly even when there were lots of open tables.  Wait staff didn't bring water out when we sat down and we had to asks for napkins and silverware when the entrees arrived.  Our Waitress hardly paused to see if the food was ok as she rushed passed us and we had to ask for our check after being forgotten an hour later.  The table next to us had several side dishes that were forgotten and a few other issues with their meals.  They had kids with them who didn't get enough to eat because of the missing items.  They addressed it nicely with the waitress 3 times while we were there.  She eventually brought some of the missing items out 10+ minutes after their entrees were cleared.  (Im no waitress but I think at that point they don't really want a cup of steamed corn to eat by itself!)  They nicely told her they wanted to talk to a manager and she agreed to get him.  They waited until she came back around and said \"did he talk to you?!\" They told her no he hadn't come out and she left again to go get him.  After more waiting they were ready to just leave but out came the manager.  I can understand a lazy hostess and bad waitress but what the manager did here was absolutely shocking.  These people had a bad meal, waited around for a manager and he finally comes out and says \"how's your night going?\" they very politely tell him that it hadn't been a great experience.  He throws the waitress under the bus and says he will talk to her about it.  The guest clarify that it's not just her fault and they are loyal customers who never experienced this type of thing there before.  They were so polite and The manager offered NO sympathy to the guests and acted indifferent as he walked back inside.  The waitress returned with their check and asked again, \"did my manager come talk to you?\"  They say \"not really, he came out but didn't address our meal at all.\"  So then the manager comes out a second time but the people have paid their check and are literally walking out.  He opens with \"I was told to come back out here\". As if it was a chore and he had no interest in actually addressing the horrible experience or offering anything to the customers.  They awkwardly relay the experience again and he again acts as if he can't understand what they are concerned about.  He says nothing even remotely apologetic.  Doesn't offer to comp the meal or even just the sides.  The people were not being whiny or trying to get a free meal.  They were super nice and composed about the whole thing but it was absolutely embarrassing how the manager handled it.   I don't remember the food, but the \"show\" was really something!"}
{"text":"We were seated 2 booths away from the doors. I was chilled, and I was wearing a hoodie and jeans. We waited 10 minutes before our waitress stopped by. No apology as to the wait to get drinks. Appetizers ranged from $7.95 ++, their menu includes fish and chips, salads, corned beef and burgers. The French fries were very well seasoned. Portions were a little large, enough for a snack the next day. Afterwards our waitress was very attentive, made sure drinks were topped off, prompt with doggy bags and check.   The atmosphere is bar/restaurant. Prices are $$, but I felt worth it. Location is prime, off of Ray and I-10."}
{"text":"I had the lunch special. My service was excellent and both the half tuna melt, which my server recommended, and the green salad were delicious, far exceeding my expectations for a bar and grill. The house-made blue cheese dressing was also great. Plus it was cheap at $6.95. They also had free Wi-Fi and some craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"Every time I go into Keegan's I am not surprised by the food or service.  It's always great and consistent.   The consistent is the most important part.   My favorite is the sweet potatoes fries and turkey burger.   I also love the chicken salad half sandwich for the lunch special. I get the French onion soup too, which is out of the world.   The service is always excellent and staff are friendly.   Don't miss out on this neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour with fantastic prices and the food was really good!  Very nice service as well."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed.  Been coming here for years.  Last night, I ordered the catfish on special. Since they burned the fish the last time I got it to go, I asked them to cook it light brown. They send it out RAW.  There were no apologies and nothing done to make it right.  Last night, they lost a regular customer!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok. Not a very great happy hour. Wings are pretty good. Kind of an older crowd. Like gray."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places. We've been for lunch and dinner and always had great meals. The menu has some great variety, and the specials are always worth checking out. Would love to give you a favorite dish, but it's a tough call. Last visit I had the open-faced steak sandwich and it was outstanding. Fish and chips are pretty awesome too. My wife will go just for the sweet potato fries. Will be back soon......and often."}
{"text":"Yelp says open till 11:00 pm, arrived at 10:00 pm on Saturday night to empty place and informed that kitchen closed 5 mins ago.  Driving 15 minuted with a larger group than in entire restaurant makes me feel that mgmt or owner was not present.  If kitchen closes at 10:00 pm, please say that in Yelp :-)"}
{"text":"Awsome food awsome service fair prices...i eat here almost everyday for lunch..they have a really good lunch combo for 6.95...have not had anything I didnt like"}
{"text":"This was a restaurant we ate at VERY frequently. The food is good, however we had an extremely rude incident occur with the manager. The hostess seated us with our baby in a booth with the sling for the infant seat set up at the end of the table. After we had been served drinks and ordered an appetizer, the manager walks over and asks us to put the baby seat inside the booth because the sling couldn't be in the isle. We picked up the baby seat to attempt putting it in the booth, and before we could even try she took the sling and walked away. It turned out, the baby seat didn't even fit in the booth but she didn't bother making sure we had a solution. No one offered to seat us elsewhere to accommodate the baby seat... Rather we were left with no where to sit and decided to walk out. Very unfortunate that a manager would give such poor service and her excuse was \"because the owner would be mad\" if she didn't take the sling out of the isle. So because of this manager, we will no longer go back!"}
{"text":"Super strong drinks . Had a dirty martini and it was delicious and strong. Super nice hostess  and waitress . Great menu. The artichoke dip was off the charts . Super classy atmosphere . The spinach artichoke dip was amazing."}
{"text":"This is a totally biased review--we've been coming here for over two decades. Best wings in town--what else matters."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and had a great experience we ordered the firecracker shrimp the baby back ribs they were delicious perfectlly cooked. We really enjoyed the sliders as well.  pumpkin stout was delicious. I had the huckleberry margarita and it was awesome"}
{"text":"Nice American bistro... not awesome, but nice.  I don't know what it is, but Americans always know how to make things that SHOULD be healthy unhealthy.  For example, I ordered the open faced toasted veggie sandwich and emphasized that I wanted less cheese on top.  I thought that would make it somewhat healthier since I was in the mood for something light (thus the veggie sandwich), but when it came out, it had a creamy sauce that was drizzled over it that I was totally not expecting... and my tummy ached after eating all that heaviness that should have been light!  The buffalo wings are tasty here, as well as the broccoli cheddar soup that I ordered.  Our friends had the angel hair shrimp pasta that was Soaking in sauce.. yet another dish that could have been on the healthy side, but Sadly, was not...  Monday's special of the day (the petit filet) was cooked nicely and tasted surprisingly good with the horseradish mustard that I found on the table next to me.  I wouldn't really want to go back here, but the food was decent... not bad, not great, just plain ol' decent."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each visit gets better!  I brought family here while visiting from MO and the staff was very attentive.  Lunch and dinner with a couple of friends and again, food was great!   Recently with a friend from out of town who enjoyed the menu due to its variety of healthy choices!  I would've given 5 stars, except the wait time on my last visit was a bit longer than expected. They made up for it with exceptional food choices and lunch specials. It's a go to place for out of town friends/family who appreciate great selection and healthy options.  Outdoor patio is great in the off season. Although they do have misters which help quite a bit.  Bar food is far from what they carry. Don't get me wrong, they have that option for those who like to partake. I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went there first time for lunch today: Service = 5: Server 'Julie' was very attentive - made me feel welcome Food Quality = 5: I had the Fish & Chips - delicious Food Portions = 2: Cole slaw served in a condiment cup, way too many fries, fish pieces could be bigger or a 3rd piece Price = 3: $14 for what I got which I think $10 would be fairer Overall = 3: Though the service and food quality was great the portion and price were not.  Most likely I will not return.... JGH"}
{"text":"This used to be one of the best restaurants in the area.  It took at least 30 minutes for us to get our order and our meal tonight was awful. I decided to try their evening special of pot roast, well that was a mistake. It tasted horrible and it was supposed to have vegetables which turned out to be a few sliced carrots and a lot of onions. My husband ordered the fish and chips which was really skimpy on the amount of fish and the French fries were soggy. They recently did some redecorating but it doesn't look much better. The acoustics were really bad (very loud) and It was difficult to talk in there.  The food and ambience were very disappointing."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night with a group and we had excellent service. The specialty drinks were yummy and were a deal! My favorite (out of two I had tried) was the ketel-one pineapple martini! My sister had a house salad, the dressing tasted homemade, and the croutons were nice and crunchy! I had the Positano Steak Sandwich which was great, my only complaint it was a little too salty, and the fries (and I love fries) were tasty! Other people had the lasagna and they loved it. My sister had the baby back ribs and loved them. If you're looking for a pub-like restaurant that has good prices, pretty tasty food (with a good variety of items on the menu), and excellent cocktails, Keegan's is your place!"}
{"text":"If you want bland burgers, lousy service, and to be told that you are wrong. Go to Keegan's and speak with the manager Alex. Not only will he tell you that you basically have no idea what you're talking about, but will also renege any comp that is offered. Our sever, well, bartender needs to take a class in hospitality as well."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place while driving by. We got the steak Cobb salad, ribs, and sangria which were all delicious! Our server, the patio, and the ambiance were all wonderful as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious!  Burgers on pretzel buns is where it's at.  And the fish tacos were amazing and I don't even like fish!  If you're thinking about trying is place, do yourself a favor and go!"}
{"text":"There was an older couple going in before us that wanted to know about gluten free options and no one one the wait staff could answer them. The staff just kept telling them they had a gluten free bun. But never told them what they could prepare for them. They ended up leaving. I wish we had left too. We sat ouside, which was nice, but received zero service. It took 15 mins to get drinks. I had to go get my own box from the wait station when we left after i asked twice for one. We wont be back. Their food was average, but they clearly don't care about service."}
{"text":"Went last night for happy hour. The restaurant got really busy, did slow down drinks and what not. But our server was super friendly. Made the experience a much better one than last couple times. I didn't catch his name but will definitely be in much more bc of him."}
{"text":"The food = 4.5 stars The Environment = 1 star Wifi = 2.5 stars: The wifi works great, but there are no conveniently located outlets  The real place that Keegan's Grill looses me is the ambiance of the restaurant. I don't like when restaurants are dark and not open. This place is not really somewhere we frequent (even though the food is good) because I don't like how dark it is. If you're looking for a good lunch then this place does the job, but if you're looking for food and environment then I would recommend choosing one of the other places on the same road."}
{"text":"i like keegan's.  it's a small chain in phoenix.  they also have one on camelback and another in queen creek.  the food is quality for the most part.  it's american style with some original twists.  the grilled chicken sandwich has a marinated cucumber on it and it's such a nice touch and really makes the sandwich.  also if you order a salad make sure you order the lime ginger vinaigrette dressing.  it's homemade delciousness.    the peach cobbler is to die for and so is the mudpie.    i used to work here years ago and the place is clean and the chefs know what they're doing.  so, i may be biased to keegan's."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone to this location for 17 years. The new owner told us he came from the franchise restaurant industry. Sadly his lack of restaurant experience has been apparent from day one. Previously, we knew we would have great customer service and a great meal, but that has changed. The professional serving staff disappeared and were replaced with unskilled entry level servers. It has been many months of bad service but we stuck it out because the food was still good and we hoped the servers would improve. And in last few months we have had a few good servers....except last Friday.  On Friday it was a disaster:   * The Server stated that this was her first dinner shift and she was unable to answer questions about the menu. That wasn't an issue until her lack of training and experience made it a problem.  * They ran out of sangria glasses at 5:30 pm. My sangria tasted like watered down wine and usually after half a drink I can feel a little buzz and there was nothing after finishing this one. *  After declining a second bar drink I was not offered water even though I was still eating. * Our salads contained limp greens. * My husbands meal was missing his side dish. * My meal had my husbands side dish. (The Dill Carrots were tasteless and the Broccoli had no condiments or seasoning) * We asked for lemon wedges for our fish and were given lemon slices (for water glasses). Lemon slices cannot be squeezed. * My meal was the days' special \"Parchment wrapped Orange Roughy\" and one of the more expensive items on the menu. The fish tasted old and was really inedible.  It was covered with a stinky cheese (maybe Gorgonzola), tomatoes and onions.  I was so hungry I scrapped the topping off and ate fast. Because we didn't get the lemon wedges we asked for it was pretty disgusting. (FYI - I'm okay with strong cheeses, this was a complete recipe fail)  * No one asked if our meal was okay. * Throughout our meal it sounded like dishes were being tossed around in the server/kitchen area. Not classy.  * The server overcharged us on our bill.  We wanted to leave and put this experience behind us so we didn't bother asking to get it fixed. * Our two meals with tip totaled $60.  What was supposed to be our Friday night treat left us feeling cheated.   In a few months we may give them another chance, if it hasn't improved we won't be back."}
{"text":"I think you really have to know what you're getting yourself into if you're coming to Keegan's. if you're looking for a fancy steak dinner or some badass lobster, this probably shouldn't be your first stop. However, if you're looking for some tasty, traditional American fare, Keegan's is bomb.com!  There's one reason and one reason only that my husband and I decided to come to Keegan's in the first place: potato skins. While pregnant, I've been craving loaded potatoes and potato skins like nobody's business, so one night we did a quick Yelp search for skins, and Keegan's was the first place that popped up.  Let me tell you, they did NOT disappoint. They were exactly what you'd hope a potato skin would be: crispy skin on the outside, extra cheesy, loaded with bacon. So simple, yet so complex. Not to mention, an order of them comes with at least 16 skins! It's a lot of food (obviously I eat the entire thing by myself).  On top of their skins, we've tried the mac and cheese, chorizo queso, and french onion soup. All of them have been excellent every single time we've come. It's definitely not the fanciest of meals, but sometimes all you really want is a little bit of grease and some good ol' fashioned bar food, and Keegan's fits the bill every time."}
{"text":"The Monday meatloaf special.  Do it.  Don't let the pepper in the picture I posted scare you, I'm the one who peppered the hell out of it, not them.  I like pepper, sue me  :)"}
{"text":"Really great experience. Alex was my bartender and waiter and he made it a really pleasant experience. I had the \"twenty year famous shrimp tacos\" and they were excellent.  I live in a coastal town know for its seafood tacos and these, in Phoenix, were as good as any I've had at home.  With a side of green chili Mac and cheese and a spectacular dinner salad (nice touch with the dill) ...awesome meal. I have to admit I've been here a few times before and have not felt as satisfied, but tonight... Wow. It's what have you done for me lately, right? Lately this place rocks.  Btw, the guy next to me just got served the 1/2 chicken and it's pretty dinky. Looks like half a Cornish hen.  Maybe avoid that..."}
{"text":"Conner and the potato skins were great. Burger was wrong and undercooked, fish was under portioned...we left and asked for the entrees to be taken off the bill. \"New management\" did not even bother to come to the table to apologize. Will never return because of management, kitchens make mistakes."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Amazing food and great service and atmosphere!  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had to go because my middle son is named Keegan!  It was good. Not amazing. But well worth being a place we like to go!  The staff was really friendly, which for us with 3 kids is very important."}
{"text":"Home made corned beef hash was very tasty though a wee bit salty. Poached eggs were perfect.  Cheddar Biscuits were fairly boring.  Overall a tasty breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great food!  I had the turkey an cranberry on a pretzel bun, and my wife had the Thai Cobb salad, both were awesome!"}
{"text":"Keegan's is still one of my favorite places and I have the receipts to prove it.  Yep, three times in the last four days. Don't judge. =)   Check out the Football Gameday Specials! First beer is $1, happy hour prices after that. Plus, the 12oz M.O.A.B (Mother of all Burgers) is only $7.95 with fries! Monday, Saturday and Sunday during college or pro games!!  See you there!"}
{"text":"Great place with friendly staff and and cold beer and great eats! It came recommended from a friend and Keegan's did not disappoint! If you are curious, go check it out, it's worth it! Awesome happy hour too!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!!  So, yes the vibe may be quite tranquil and more of an upscale diner, but the food is AMAZING!! It's clearly made to order and fresh! Yum! Service is quick, attentive and the restaurant is clean. Good selection of craft beers too. Absolutely will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go.   You can eat healthy or you can eat fried foods and their wonderful mud pie.  We love the huge salads with chicken or steak on them. The steaks are good and the meatloaf (a special item not on the regular menu) was one of the best we had with more meat than typical meatloafs.  They have specials regularly and the St Patrick's corned beef and cabbage is outstanding (very lean corned beef and not over seasoned).  If you like beers, they have a good selection.   There is a bar in one area and booths in most of the restaurant.  With some tables inside and some outside.  It is not loud, so easy to talk to others at the table.  The menu is not huge but it has enough choices to find something you will like.  The only thing I wish they had was more choices of appetizers as most are fried foods or heavy with cheese.  If we want an appetizer, we stick with the hummus plate which is good."}
{"text":"Must have bitchy resting face to work here.  Service has always been terrible and the staff walks around like miserable zombies.  Food is usually pretty good though."}
{"text":"Looking for a late dinner my husband and I stopped into Keegan's 5 minutes before the kitchen closed. The hostess and waitress were both very nice. We both ordered the turkey burger and it was amazing. The restaurant hand a calm atmosphere, my husband watched some sport on the tv and we enjoyed our meal. We were never rushed and the staff was very attentive. I will be back again"}
{"text":"Really fun atmosphere and a reasonably priced menu don't skip on the fries! Short staffed when we were there but all of them have awesome personalities!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant and it's unique menu. I chose a sandwich I wouldn't normally pick and was not disappointed. The spinach dip was unlike any other. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my \"go to\" places to eat. They have a special going on right now: there are four different meals, each one being $11. I ordered the Tri tip salad. Seemed like a pretty good deal as most dishes are $12-18. It was delicious but it seemed like 3 small slabs of steak with a little salad on the side. I cleaned my plate and was still hungry.  Overall, it was a decent experience but maybe a little extra lettuce to make it seem like a salad."}
{"text":"We went in for St. Patrick's Day to get the corn beef and cabbage. Two of us got the corn beef and one of us got the rosemary chicken. The rosemary chicken was good but the corn beef was horrible. We got super dry rubber meat. I've had better food McDonald's. If you're going to have a special for a holiday you should pay attention to it especially when you charge $15 for it. I wish I could get my money back.  It was a complete rip off."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful restaurant. We frequent for Sunday brunch with Megan who is a bartender. She's amazing.  Such wonderful service and food. Lunches are fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Overall I have nothing bad to say. The waitress was attentive. The food was great. I ate all of my soup and sandwich. My husband ate all of his burger and fries.  Inside it was nice and clean they also have a patio that had a good amount of shade and seating options.  The food presentation was nice and clean. I would love to come back here for more!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for St. Patricks Day and it was very busy. We had a bit of a wait for our food, but the atmosphere was fun. The food was so-so but priced accordingly."}
{"text":"This is our first time at Keegans. The place was extremely crowded at dinner time. All  the seats were taken on the patio and the dining room was pretty full. We were seated right away at a large booth next to window I'm very close to her special sign. Our waiter was Brian, who is very knowledgeable about the  menu and very helpful. Brian was very good at what he did filled our drinks again before they ran out and picked up the dirty plates right away. Keegan has a small menu but there's something for everyone. They have  burgers sandwiches, salad, steak, main entrees.  I"}
{"text":"Got the filet and it is so good! Alan got the salmon and he loved it! Way better than outback! Plus there is such a great vibe here. There is quite a few people in here but it's not over packed at all. Amazing service with amazing food! Try it once it speaks for itself!"}
{"text":"My family (2 from Casa Grande, 2 from Mesa, 2 from Gilbert and us from Chandler) have gathered at this Keegan's twice...We have all enjoyed it thoroughly!  Our waiter yesterday and the one we had before were attentive and funny...The food is always great and the prices very reasonable!  I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Keegan's for breakfast almost every weekend. I hadn't been by in a few weeks because I've been busy, and when I went in yesterday, I was surprised to find that they had a new breakfast menu. The old breakfast menu was composed of breakfast classics: three-egg omelets, pancakes, a breakfast burrito, huevos rancheros, etc-- it was tried and true, I never had a problem finding something that I wanted to eat, and at about $6.95 per entree, I couldn't go wrong. Well, the new breakfast menu is nothing like that. I had trouble finding something that I actually WANTED to eat. Instead of three-egg omelets for $6.95, they now have one and a half or two egg frittatas for $7.95-- so they raised the prices and you're now getting even less food for the money. Also, some of the dishes on the new breakfast menu just sound straight up disgusting. Puff pastry, eggs, and marinara for breakfast? No thank you. Unfortunately, it looks like I will have to find a new breakfast joint."}
{"text":"I've been to Keegan's a few times, and I would like to give this 2 1/2 stars bc  it is exactly a middle of the road kind of place. The food was fine, atmosphere normal, drinks were drinks. Nothing stood out to me, but there was also nothiing wrong. I wouldn't suggest it if friends were getting together, but if someone else wanted to go, I wouldn't mind. (but I wouldn't get the nachos)"}
{"text":"Awesome place for such me after work dinner an a pint. Really cool atmosphere with an outdoor patio. Very accessible with plenty of parking nearby. Food is great tasting and wholesome. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I cannot over state this. The waitress literally made us feel like we had somehow personally offended her by simply choosing to eat there. I almost got our food boxed up because she made us feel so unwelcomed. And I am not someone who needs to \"make friends\" with every server I meet, but I do like to be friendly....yeah not happening here. Don't even care that the food was fine. Not. Worth. It."}
{"text":"I've given it 2 chances lately and both times it was mediocre food and disappointing service. Won't bother to go back."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place - it's our \"go-to\" local spot.  You can sit outside when it's nice, by the bar to catch the game, or in the back for more quiet.  I've never been disappointed with the food, and I've become partial to the veggie melt sandwich even though I'm a carnivore.  And the beer is always cold and crisp."}
{"text":"It was a little expensive.  $65.80 for two apps, one drink, two sodas, two entrees, and one shared dessert.  Highlights:  The Grilled Wings were very good.   Nice and crisp, charred but not burned, and not too fatty.  I could have eaten two dozen of them. The Cheddar Potatoes were a hit at the table, liked by all. The Creme Brulee was excellent, and about twice the size that Torched Goodness offers, for 5 cents less than TG charges.  Lowlights:  The hummus was just plain, and there was something else they put on top of it, something a little bitter - ??  Not sure what it was, but it was not impressive. The \"half rack\" of ribs were pretty tiny for $14.95.  Not a lot of meat. The Flatiron Steak was also tiny, and overcooked.  Not very tasty at all. Mashed potatoes and Mac-N-Cheese were very pedestrian.  All in all, I might go back, have 2 orders of the wings app, and finish with Creme Brulee.  But I won't go with the kids again, not for $75 with tip.  We could have eaten 3 times at Los Taquitos for that price."}
{"text":"If I could give the food a separate rating it would a 1 star. Ribs were dry, firecracker shrimp was a little salty and not a good flavor. The Cesar salad was not good, the seasoning of the dressing was off. I am giving them 4 stars for the following reasons. First and foremost the bartender was great. Very attentive and kept the drinks coming. The ambiance was on par and music wasn't too loud so you can hear the person talking sitting next to you. They had a good selection of beer and mixed cocktails. The house made sangria was good. If you are looking for a low key place for drinks this is your place."}
{"text":"Good food selection.  I am roadtripping homr yo washington and was really happy to see a Moscow mule on the menu. Happy hour is 2-5 In the living room and 2-630pm Monday through fri in the bar and patio."}
{"text":"Dad & I came here for dinner tonight, him ordering the Stroganoff, & I ordered the Keegan's Street Tacos with chicken & Green Chili Mac & Cheese as my side of choice.   We had a very nice waitress, who was very efficient in checking up on us & keeping our glasses filled. She was also very helpful in our decisions on what to order.   The ambience of this restaurant is nice, although next time we go, we'll ask to be seated away from the bar, as it was a bit noisy where we were at.  As for the food? Our meals were delicious, but the ONLY drawback (which coincidentally led me to giving this place 4 stars out of 5) was that Dad nearly swallowed a toothpick that was in the steak pieces in his meal. We showed this to the waitress, who in turn notified the manager right away. She came over right away & apologized for the inconvenience, thanked us for pointing it out, & presented us with a coupon for a free appetizer on our next visit!   We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"They are friendly to food couriers. Sometimes there is a wait, but the staff I've dealt with are kind and treated me like a customer (which is more than can be said about a lot of places). Thanks"}
{"text":"First off, I am not a negative person and find myself rarely writing negative reviews, but my last experience takes the cake in customer service, or lack off.....long story short...I ordered the Flatiron steak, MEDIUM, it came out thoroughly overcooked. Our server apologized and offered to prepare another, but we could not wait. The manager, blonde woman, 50's,  never came over to apologize or see what would make me happy, what happened to table touching to ensure guest satisfaction? Steve, please teach your management staff the \"Art of Customer Service\". Being in the business, I would hope my guests would reach out to me and share their last ever experience....Ahwatukee is a small town and I'd hate to see a business go down due to poor management. I'm sorry to say goodbye to Keegan's but there are so many other restaurants that shows appreciation for my business"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere.  Love the Basil/vinegar salad dressing.  Outstanding \"home town\" bar and grill, far better than normal bar food. Best in the Ahwatukee area."}
{"text":"They bring out a clean rack of glasses and set them on a trash can. A trash can that they continue to put trash in.  Get bottles or cans folks. Pray your drink doesn't come in a trash glass. Disgusting AF!"}
{"text":"The day we came in was a Sunday, but it was an odd hour, somewhere around 2:30-3:00 pm. I came in with my Mom, my Husband and our Realtor. We had been out looking for houses in Ahwatukee all day for my mom as we are trying to get her to move here. I chose this place because I wanted to show my mom that Ahwatukee has cool local places to eat.   The four of us came in to about a 50% full restaurant an asked for a larger table or booth since we had a few computers, tablets, and folders of papers to sit down with and look through and discuss from our day of looking at houses. The hostess flat out told us no on the larger table and sat us at a regular booth without saying anything else and walked away. Okay then.   Our server arrived and I asked for the wifi password. She didn't know it and told me her guess. It was not correct, and she didn't ask someone else for help. The food was average, but any extras or substitutions that we ordered were charged to us but not delivered. (avocado added to a sandwich, barbeque sauce on the side, etc. Nothing crazy)  I saw a review down below that compared this restaurant to the likes of Applebees or Chilis. That's a little harsh. The food isn't bad here, and the atmosphere is also okay. That's exactly what Keegan's is, just okay. The service needs help badly."}
{"text":"Hubby and I consider Keegan's one of our favorite spots in the area, and we have never been disappointed with food or service.  So it seemed like a good idea to take our out-of-town guest there tonight.  All three of us came away delighted.  Our server, Shy, was delightful and took excellent care of us.  She quickly brought our cocktails, which were very good, and then answered all our questions about menu options.  She was quite knowledgeable, but when she didn't know an answer she left briefly to get the correct information for us.  I had the chicken piccata, a personal favorite.  The chicken was tender, served on lemon butter and artichoke heart, and topped with a generous portion of capers.  The selection included Keegan's wonderful cheesy potatoes and fresh green beans.  Everything was delicious.  Both my husband and our guest ordered fried fish.  Both ate every bite! Our friend ordered the sweet potato fries with her fish and declared them some of the best she'd ever had.  All in all, it was a great dinner experience.  We will definitely be back.  BTW  - Shy told us the restaurant will be closing around July 11 for a complete remodel.  Should be closed a couple of weeks."}
{"text":"Good beer and drink happy hour specials. We had lunch. Burgers are Ok. Staff spent more time socializing than serving. Probably won't bother again. A standard experience. The bar its self is nicely decorated."}
{"text":"So, this is one in the series of reviews I'm throwing up there during my #transient-week adventure during the first week of July thru Southern Nevada and Arizona.   This place gets my vote! After an exhausting day of sun and alcohol running the tubes thru the Salt River, we came here for some R&R. I picked up the Rosemary Chicken which was huge on the portion size. Plus delicious. The service was quick and friendly. It was medium as far as the indoor traffic was concerned, but enough to where our waitress could have easily been distracted and not cared about us. I like it overall. Nice place to revisit next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I have been here so many times, and it's always a great experience. Attentive service, great food, and great drinks! Get the firecracker shrimp tacos with the black beam salad. Don't even think about it, just get them! You won't be disappointed. I have had them every time I've eaten at Keegan's, except for one time. I had the Calihan Cobb salad, and it was delicious. Tender steak, cooked exactly how I asked, and everything was fresh. But for real, get the shrimp tacos!!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out Keegan's for our first visit after reading an article that it had recently changed owners. The menu was pretty basic with almost no vegetarian options (with 1 entree exception).  Keegan's does have a more upscale ambiance but In a metro area like Phoenix, I think there is an expectation for a bit more menu options such as a lot of the California restaurants offer -if you are targeting that sort of niche. Service was slow and the waitress not overly friendly."}
{"text":"came here for a business lunch.... i had the thai cobb - it was delicious, although the salmon was a little bit over cooked.   the service was decent, aside from the young waitress calling everyone in our party \"hon\".... considering i was the youngest in the party by at least 10 years.   i was pleasantly surprised at the quality/presentation of food since i was expecting a sports bar."}
{"text":"We went to Keegan's between lunch and dinner on a Saturday so definitely not very lively. The d√©cor is nice and our server was very attentive. My least favorite part of this restaurant is their menu, including their beer selections on tap. Nothing really screamed out to me as something I had to try and the food I did try was just OK in my book. The potato skins were decent and the chicken sandwich came with cucumbers and no lettuce or tomato...odd. The sweet potato fries were good though. Overall, this place is just an \"eh\" for me."}
{"text":"Happy hour A+! Great brews. various IPAs & good appetizers to choose from. Firecracker shrimp are to die for & only $5??? Try them already! Had their Chicken Fried Steak special on Tuesday night & it's delicious- atmosphere is chill and unpretentious, definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and sat in the bar area. Essentially, the whole experience was average. The service was average. The food was average. The food options are average. Average can be a good thing, not necessarily a bad. This place is appropriate for a more traditional palate. If you're looking for a food adventure, this is not the place. If you have a picky eater who is not an adventurous eater, this is the place for you. I am more for exotic, specially crafted foods so this place was lackluster for me, but I would be open to coming back if someone suggested it!  Other things about this place: it has a clean, trendy ambiance to it. They have normal dining seating, indoor and out, and indoor bar seating. They have a nightly social time that starts at 8pm. They do have tvs at the bar area."}
{"text":"Ordered flatiron steak first time charred to a crisp .. Sent back came back raw in the center"}
{"text":"I *think* Keegan's is a local-chain, but a decent option for some late-(ish) night dinner and drinks.  I really enjoyed their steak salad here, but in general, their food is pretty solid all the way around.  Think of it as an oak-ier Chilis ... that is, much of the same menu and full bar, but in a richer-wood environment.  Its dark inside which makes for a good place to duck into during the summer latency for a beer and apps, especially when you find yourself in the concrete synthesis of the Ahwatook.  They once had Shiner on tap here, but I think they took it off draft for good.  A swift kick in the arse for that one.  They have the standard taps, but then will also have a domestic specialty or two, and a nice import.  They also have daily dinner specials that knock of a nice chunk of change on nice meals like pork chops or whatevs.    Patio seating is available if you, for some reason, enjoy the goings-on of teens hanging out at the Barnes & Noble before they head into the AMC to catch some stupid Bam Margera freak show stunts."}
{"text":"Keegan's quality has slipped.  I've eaten here many times but the last two weekends, the family and I have tried out brunch.  The staff has been running- way overburdened- and the food has been way overcooked.  They've now lost our brunch business.  For $50 or $60, you must serve a quality product and have decent service."}
{"text":"The best Green Chili Pork Stew on the planet!! We found it as a Daily Special, went back the next day for Leftovers! Service was excellent, BtW."}
{"text":"Think of like an applebees but with a marginally better ambiance if that is even possible.  There is not one thing that came to our table of four that was mouth watering good to where you cannot wait to come back to try the rest of the menu.  I had ordered the firecracker shrimp in hopes that it would have some hell of a kick to it with that name.  The shrimp tasted like it was frozen too long and then had that really fishy taste and absolutely drenched in salt hundreds of times to where I felt like I was going to get sick and eventually by the end of the night I did end up getting sick from the food.  My boyfriend had ordered a sandwich and a cheese dip before we had ordered that was not anything to rave about.  Our friend had ordered the burgers and fries and could not even finish half the burger and couldn't even touch her fries and I was too scared to even ask to try them as to why she couldn't continue. The firecracker shrimp I had ordered I had to make sure i wrapped them in the tortilla to be able to even eat them.  For the first time ive ever been to a restaurant and thought \"they gave me too much shrimp\". When normally I would be more than ecstatic to have an over abundance of shrimp.  Definitely never going to go back with how bad the food was and even the service now that I think about it wasn't all too great I kept hoping to god the waitress would have came over to ask if I needed more water.  But she was barely around to ask.  What a shame."}
{"text":"If you go here and have the Filet Mignon or the Stroganoff, that also has Filet Mignon as the beef, and you don't like it...I'll pay for your meal. The only exception is that I get to punch you in the face as hard as I can. Why? Because you suck. If you don't like this then chances are you don't like bacon or good cheese or success or America and I have a problem with you."}
{"text":"Keegan's in Ahwatukee is a great place to grab a beer and great food. Everything on the menu is made to order and fresh. The bar area is quaint and the service here is great. Sunday brunch is a much check out! Happy hour specials everyday til 630pm."}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner the other night. We sat in the bar area and it was happy hour! We were disappointed that they were not showing the ASU/UofA game in the bar through. We got the spinach and artichoke dip to start. It was tasty, with plenty of artichokes, but a small portion. I had the taproom steak sandwich, positano style for my meal!  It's a open-faced sandwich with gorgonzola arugula on a baguette. The basil tomatoes it came with were amazing! The steak was cooked perfectly for how I ordered it (medium). And the kale side salad was nice and healthy! Overall, I enjoyed my meal, but I thought the prices were a little high for the experience and food."}
{"text":"I went to lunch with a coworker, after I just got off of work. She was going back, but we had an hour of downtime. We ordered our drinks, and received those quickly. Our Lady waitress asked if we needed more time, and we said yes, as it was our first time at Keegan's. Ten minutes later, a waiter walked up and said he would be serving our table instead. I asked for a refill then and we ordered our appetizer. We didn't see our waiter again until he brought out our appetizer. Still no refill. I had finished the appetizer, and we were waiting to order. I flagged our waiter down, and asked for a refill again. This time he went right to refill the drink. Once he returned we were able to order. I asked for no onions on my burger, with extra pickles. To my dismay, I received a burger with two pickle slices and plenty of onions. At this point we were a bit rushed with eating, because my co-worker's lunch hour was nearly up. I pulled the onions off and  didn't ask for more pickles. One drink, a pretzel burger and half appetizer totalled to $22.00. The fries were delicious, but the spinach artichoke dip came with broccoli and carrots, which didn't make sense to me. Plate fillers- I think. I also came with salsa, which was terrible. The pretzel burger was tainted by the onions, so it could have been better if done right. Overall experience felt cheap, when the bill was quite pricey. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"my husband and I started going to Keegan's on Sunday's for their brunch, which is pretty decent. If you get there after 10am, the bar is open, which is a plus in my book.  We've eaten lunch and dinner there a few times as well. They have a really good french onion soup, another soup I think was chicken pepper jack and the cobb sandwich is good. Their chicken fried steak is pretty good as well. They give you two decent sized steaks covered in mashed potatoes and gravy. The bar is good as they have a great selection of beers.  I also love their ice tea, it always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight was my first experience at Keegans and I'll be back...  Location is convenient, our waitress was efficient, prices were within reason (happy hour after 8pm everyday is a plus) and the food was better than the typical bar food scene. I had the BBQ ribs with mashed potatoes & steamed broccoli & the hubby had Panko fish & chips. I liked that they offered free range grass fed burgers, organic pilaf options along with being able to order some dishes with less sodium/sugar/carbs. The inside is cozy & pub like; I look forward to sitting on the patio in the coming months..."}
{"text":"\"Keegan's Grill...seriously?\" That was my response when I was asked to go to Keegan's Grill for lunch Sunday afternoon. Typically I won't step foot in an American chain restaurant. You know the ones - who serve uninspired bar food and sing happy birthday songs.   Keegan's Grill is different. There are only 3 in the area and compared to the American chain restaurants, who serve @$@! bar food, they have a decent menu.   They take pride in their homemade soups, which I was drawn to. I ordered their onion soup. The base had pretty good flavor, the onions were nicely caramelized, the crouton was just the right size, topped with just enough cheese, and most importantly, it was served piping hot.   I'm not sure if Keegan's Grill is the kind of place where I will plan in advance to go, but overall it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Burgers were great.  Beer was good. Everyone was pretty pleased.  I especially liked the fact that the burgers were RARE when requested is a big plus in my opinion.  They have a wide selection of draft beers which was nice."}
{"text":"I can only speak for this Locations quality but I LOVE it here they have never disappointed me!   They have delicious homemade soups each day something different. My favorite is the Tomato Bacon soup if you can be lucky enough to get there on a day they have it.   They always have a lunch special and a dinner special to choose from, I Love that!   Best chicken salad sandwich I've ever had,  Best Fish and chips I've ever had juicy white fish crusted with panko crumbs NOT greasy AT ALL.   Their Creme' Brulee is right up there with Fleming's or Ruth's Chris.   Again I'll say this is one of my Favorite places to eat I know it is always consistently good fresh food!   5 Stars for being Delicious Every time, I Love you Keegans Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"found this through yelp on a night where we just wanted to sit,relax, and have a iittle food and i'm SO happy we did! we came in around 9, sat in the bar area, was served right away, and got amazing service. the hummus was good but since they were out of their usual variety, our drinks were comped. we ordered potato skins, which had chipolte sour cream and were delightful! i can see going back to try their regualr menu- it is contemporary american food, but what's so worng with that every once in a while???"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch today and it was not so impressive. It used to be really hidden jam type of place in tukee area, but somehow the food did not taste good. The burger and the sandwitch did not taste like it used to. The small plates they gave us were so dirty that I can even guess what was there before. The service was ok. I might go back for dinner where they serve delicious back ribs. Hopefully it will be better next time."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch w/ some coworkers this past week.  The food was great. I had the turkey sandwich that has cranberry sauce and cole slaw on it. good even the second day."}
{"text":"Average, clean, pseudo-pub-style restaurant with a good menu. Pricing is average or slightly less ($8-$12 for lunch) and they have a variety of tap beers as well as a full bar.  I didn't hear anyone in our party of six say anything negative about the food nor the service. The menu seems pretty straight-up to me, with no weird surprises. One person in our party ordered sweet potato fries with her food which came out crispy, the consistency of regular fries. I know how hard it is to crisp up sweet potato fries so this deserves a plus-one!  Also, my cobb salad included chunks of smoked gouda in addition to the bleu cheese. Bonus!"}
{"text":"Good daily specials and great chicken salad sandwich."}
{"text":"Great bar service, wonderful Cesar salad and I love that it comes with the yummy little dinner rolls. Definitely caters to an older crowd but the food is good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while but with a couple coupons in hand we stopped by twice in a week. First trip I got fish and chips. It came out super fast meaning it was already cooked. Dry and not very hot. Wife enjoyed clam chowder and salad. Warm brownie desert was awesome. Declined $7.50 beer. Good enough so we came back later in week with another\"secret\" coupon that they gave us first time. I got pork tenderloin (always good). Wife got half chicken. Again food came out quick. My pork great as always but my favorite carrots looked like the bagged \"baby\" carrots from Frys. Her chicken dry and without flavor. Server a little snappy. She didn't open the \"secret\" coupon in front of us but we got the max 25%.  No hurry to come back."}
{"text":"Decent food. We ordered cod fish tacos and salmon with quinoa which was listed as lifestyle menu. My entree side was kale salad which was not my favorite. Drinks were good and service was nice but slow."}
{"text":"I have been to this spot for lunch, Dinner and Happy Hour many times... I have always enjoyed every meal and a few keep me coming back. The Dagwood - Smoked Ham, Turkey, Bacon, Slaw, with LT&M On Rye. Panko Fish & Chips - Homemade Caper Tartar Sauce, Malt Vinegar, Cole Slaw & Fries. Nearly World Famous Tacos - Grilled Mahi or Firecracker Shrimp with Warm Flour Tortillas, Salsa, Chipotle Sour Cream & Choice of Side. Plus the Sweet Potato Fries... I rate the food as followed.  Dagwood - A+ Panko Fish & Chips - A Nearly World Famous Tacos - B+ Sweet Potato Fries - A BBQ Sauce - A  I really enjoy the Dagwood it's a great sandwich along with a order of sweet potato fries... I will be back again really soon for a great meal."}
{"text":"For the price and quality of the food, I'll go elsewhere. Huge tasteless burger. But a good selection of beer!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and mediocre service for the prices- nothing too special to make me want to come back. Should've went with my instinct and just gone to sweet tomatoes next door.."}
{"text":"I went here because I really wanted potato skins and I had an awful experience at Gallaghers and left. The food here was not bad,but overpriced, and the service was above average. I would go back, but would probably prefer happy hour :-)"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while b/c honestly my wife wasn't impressed with the food, from earlier visits here. Read in the AFN, that Keegan's was under New Ownership, so we thought we'd give it another try.  Much to our disappointment, the ONLY thing that's changed is the sign! They didn't remodel the bar and are STILL serving the EXACT same menu, that was STALE years ago with the OLD owner. Nothing NEW on the menu at all for years now!   When we came in we decided to sit at the bar. The bartender (Meghan) was VERY engaging and helpful. I decided to order one of the Specials for the day, which was the Patty Melt! My wife ordered the other special, Chicken tortilla soup and a Turkey Melt. How could you mess those up, right?   My Patty Melt came out and I bit into it and it literally was cold in the middle and WAY too rare to ever serve in a restaurant. The French Fries however weren't bad though. I sent my Patty Melt back to be cooked this time. When I got it back it was done just fine, but honestly it had ZERO taste to it! The burger itself didn't seem seasoned at all. Just plain ole meat cooked on the flat top. It had NO taste to it at all, none! Needless to say I didn't finish it. On the bright side, my wife said her Chicken Tortilla Soup was really good. But she felt the Turkey Melt was pretty bland as well.   Keegan's is an okay place to get a beer, but I don't plan on coming back until everything changes!  Especially the menu! Their food's just NOT that good for the price."}
{"text":"Great food. Everything had good flavor and was brought out on time and hot. Service was great, too."}
{"text":"I thought $5 for a beer during happy hour was not reasonable.  While the food was ok, it seemed a expensive for a sports bar."}
{"text":"I like this place because they always have some cool and unusual beers on tap (as well as local favorites from San Tan and Four Peaks) but the food is pretty good, too.  It is one of those places that is sort of a cross between a sports bar and a steakhouse.  Their reverse happy hour starts at 8pm which is convenient for those of us who like to get our drink on but not stay out too late.  The apps are only $4 during that time.  I got the sliders and I really enjoyed them.  The wings are very unusual, with a dry rub instead of buffalo sauce, but they were pretty tasty, too."}
{"text":"Went for reverse happy hour. We ordered the wings which had decent seasoning but it wasn't crispy and overall was ehh. They have a decent selection of beer though, and my husband and I tried a really good IPA there. It was nice and quiet there on a Saturday night (which was perfect for us because we just wanted to eat some food with beer)."}
{"text":"I love Keegans. Does anyone know their secret to the grilled wings? I would love to duplicate them as close as possible. Im addicted to these thing! I love th beef stroganoff too! We visit this place about once a week. Usually the Ocotillo location though! And almost forgot to mention, the cheesy potatos are delish too! As well as the tomato bacon, I believe it was soup. Also enjoyed the crab cakes on special one evening but havent seen them again since."}
{"text":"Quite bland stroganoff. Margarita was the worst ever had so sent back. They made another and that was worse. Tasted like soda water. Burger was good but $15 seemed steep.  Paid $8.95 for sliders for my son and they were 2 and super small. Then $3.25 for small side of undercooked fries. Not worth the price tag in my opinion. And we used to love Keegan's.  Service was good."}
{"text":"We finally came here for dinner but we were disappointed. There wasn't alot to choose from and it's quite expensive. The service was fine and the food was pretty decent but we expected a very different menu and a larger one at that. Plus their prices were way too much. I doubt we'd be back."}
{"text":"The only reason it got a two stars is because the waitress was great!! The food was not good at all maybe it was a bad night who knows. Little disappointed as this place is right around the corner from my house and it looks like I will need to find a different place to grab a bite to eat. I'm not going to beat this place up with a long drawn out review all I am going to say is sadly I don't plan in coming back."}
{"text":"Tried to get take out but my order wasn't  big enough I guess because the RUDE woman on the phone just hung up on me. I called back asked for a manager and she said he was out running errands. I asked for him to call me and I never got a call. Frankly if a place thinks there too big to take one dinner order than they are too snooty for me! I personally will never go back after the way I was treated."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch for the first time on Friday.  Great lunch special - 1/2 Tuna Melt and a big bowl of New England Clam Chowda'.  Very tasty, plenty of food and I was told this is a standing Friday special.   Plenty of interesting beers on tap with two nice big tv's showing sports.  Staff was very friendly and I will definitely be going back.    Lunch Special, Iced Tea and a generous tip: $15"}
{"text":"It's a bar.  The beer selection is great as is the happy hour menu.  We had one of everything as it was a long day at work.   It would have been awesome if the bartender would have given a crap about us or the job that she was doing.   I won't say that I'd never go back, it just isn't on my list of places that I will run to in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Keegan's food and service is still good but we don't like the renovation they did 2-3 years ago (Ahwatukee location). What used to be dark, higher private booths, quieter, is now so bright that it is not inviting, so noisy, the booths were lower and sound is amplified. It feels more like a Luby's cafeteria. We will sit on the patio when it cools off again but we don't like Keegan's nearly as much as we used to.   Previous review--we have gone to Keegan's for years--only one time has my meal not been perfectly cooked and tasty. Tonight, we enjoyed sitting on the patio. My daughter loved their spaghetti bolognese, my husband very much enjoyed the chicken madeira and my flat iron steak was great. New server Johnny was excellent as well. Thanks Keegan's!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could...  We're out-of-towners and would never have found this place without Yelp! and we're glad we did!    It was lunchtime and I had the Beef Medallions Stroganoff and my wife had a Cheeseburger.  Both were excellent (especially the Beef Medallions)!  The meats were done perfectly and the service was very good.    We would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good bar/pub place.  The food is reasonably fresh and tasty.  The servers are friendly.  I've eaten here about a half dozen times and everything has been fine, nothing off-scale good or bad.  No complaints, A-OK."}
{"text":"I like to come here for the split pea soup on Tuesdays. Happy hour is good for wings and potato skins and beers. The problem with this place is that the service is always bad and the bathrooms are disgusting."}
{"text":"We went in for a 4th of July dinner. It was an early dinner, and the establishment was not at all busy. We were seated promptly. While being seated, we walked past several chalkboards which showcased their special beers (which looked VERY inviting), and specials of the day with regard to lunch and dinner.  I commend this restaurant for striving to be healthy, especially considering this is a brew house and not a \"artsy\" restaurant. Their menu offers selections which can be made in a lighter version to accommodate special diets. I had a couple of questions regarding ingredients in their dishes and how their \"light\" versions differed from regular versions. Our waitress politely said she wasn't sure (which I prefer over a lie), and she excused herself to find out the answer. She returned with answers and we proceeded to order.  We both ended up ordering the half chicken, but the sides we ordered I do not remember.  A few minutes later someone came back to our table (don't remember if it was the waitress or the manager), and told us that they only had one half chicken left. We would have understood if we had come later and the place was packed, but we were early, and the dinner menu had started not too long ago.  Okay, fine, I had another entree choice in mind. I spent another minute looking over the menu, and ordered a different chicken entree with 2 sides; one of which was steamed broccoli.  Our dishes arrived. The one half chicken we ordered was decent (the sides were nothing special), but there was issue with the chicken dish I received. A few pieces of the broccoli were literally ice cold and not cooked. We quickly informed the waitress, and she said they would make a new batch. The new batch came out a while later, and although it was not cold anymore, it was undercooked. Suffice it to say that I did not finish the side of broccoli.  Towards the end of the meal the manager came to our table and apologized about the meal, and offered us a dessert on the house.  Overall the customer service was fantastic, the environment was casual, and we also noticed they had plenty of quiet outdoor seating that did not face a loud street.  However, given the fact that they ran out of a main entree at the beginning of dinner service and were unable to properly cook steamed broccoli, I had to give it a 3-star (A-OK) review."}
{"text":"Went to Keegan's last night for dinner. We arrived around 7:30 PM. The amount of people there was just about right - not completely empty (which would make me feel like it was unpopular for some reason) and not completely full (which would lead to inattentiveness by our server and an overloud environment). Our waitress introduced herself and asked for our drink orders promptly, and brought them back promptly.   After looking over the menu, I ordered the filet mignon (medium) with steamed broccoli and sauteed green beans. We each had a starter - I had a salad with blue cheese dressing and he had the French onion soup. Neither of us was particularly enthused; my dressing tasted like mayonnaise and there were only a few slim morsels of blue cheese to go with my lackluster lettuce and single tomato.   The entree, however, truly redeemed any lukewarm feelings I had. It arrived only a few minutes after we finished eating our starters. The outside was charred - as advertised - but the inside was a perfect pink, just the way I like my steak done. The filet was spiced absolutely perfectly. Every bite was a new treat. The beans were also delicious. The broccoli was NOT up to par, but it was the only thing on the plate that was not divine.   After we ate our entrees, it was after 8:00, so appetizers were half-off for Reverse Happy Hour. Although our waitress said they normally do Reverse Happy Hour only at the bar, she asked her manager and told us it would be fine to order appetizers from our table - great service there. We got the spicy chicken wings - another winner! The spicing was amazing. They were really, really good.   Overall, we agreed that this restaurant was a winner. The service, filet mignon and chicken wings bring this place up to five stars, with only one star taken away for the broccoli and salad experience. I was really pleased with my experience here."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but happy hour from 2-5 or 2-6:30 on patio. The HH apps are enough to fill up on. We got firecracker shrimp & pueblo queso dip to start, both delicious!!!! Sangria, delicious!  Fish tacos, delicious. And, best dessert!!  Every dessert I've had here was amazing. Oh, and the sangrias are yummy too! It's small and cozy. Cute neighborhood place. But still haven't sold my kids on it yet.... I give it 5 stars because the staff has always been so friendly & great with my kids, the food is alway great, and it's cozy. If I could afford it, I would eat here every week!"}
{"text":"Perhaps it's not fair of me to offer a rating, since we didn't actually eat the food.  We actually turned around and walked out because this place smelled so bad.  All four in our party agreed that the bar smelled like sour, dirty socks.  All the old people eating lunch here didn't seem to notice. It was actually nauseating."}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food lacked flavor. It wasn't inedible, though. I ordered the French dip with a side of sweet potato fries. The other people in my party seemed to feel the same way about it."}
{"text":"The food and Service is ALWAYS great! My boyfriend and I are frequent visitors to this location because it never disappoints. The service is always prompt and they staff friendly. We have been working our way through the menu and haven't had anything that we did not like. It does kinda of suck that you can only have Happy Hour prices when you sit in the bar area, but it doesn't keep us away.   I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Not your same old bar food here. Great food and large beer menu. Sunday morning breakfast are awesome. The best huevos ranchero I ever had. I know, I know, I spent 10 years in South Phoenix and have had a lot authentic huevos ranchero, but these were amazing. Their artichoke spinach dip is not very good, watery and . Their wings, sliders and hummus are very good.   Casual attire, great for groups. Several big T.V.s in the bar area. The Patios are nice. A nice place for good food and conversation. Nice happy hour prices.   But seriously, stop by for Sunday breakfast. It is the only day they open for breakfast."}
{"text":"I like to think of this place as a step above Applebees but overshadowed by its cooler big sister Chili's. It's the middle child that never gets any attention and in this case, we really should just forget about it because its only contribution to society is to make us feel pathetic as we leave with our wallets empty and our stomach even emptier.   We had the Yankee Pot Roast. If the Yankees liked their food made with 3/4 of salt, they got it just right. I ordered the pasta and if I were to describe it, it's more of a watered down cream with fusili. Maybe the other location on Camelback is better, but this is the first time we've ever eaten food where it was so bad, we were laughing as we force-fed each other lovingly.  We laughed even more and cried in a fetal position at the same time when we got the check. It wasn't that we weren't expecting the price since we did order an appetizer and drinks - it just hits you that you seriously ate horrible food and can't do anything about it.  I mean I guess you could, but nevertheless you would still lose because you're just a bitter jerk who still ate a horrible meal. You're better off going to Boston Market across the street."}
{"text":"Keegan's is a \"go-to\" place for me.  Consistently good food that isn't your run of the mill bar food.  Comfort food and pub grub, all with a bit of a twist.  My favorites are the stroganoff, rosemary chicken, and the something something (I can't remember the name - sorry!) garlicky turkey burger.  Happy hour specials are nothing to turn your nose up at either - their grilled chicken wings are phenomenal as are many of the other apps I've tried."}
{"text":", I have lived down the street from this place for four years and have never went over to actually delivered my food to me and I can tell you these are the best potato skins that I have ever ever ever had the sauce that they make is super delicious I would highly recommend this"}
{"text":"We came here for \"social hour\" aka happy hour. They have it from 8-close.   There's some $5 drink specials, that include cocktails, martinis, margaritas, wine, beer, etc. and their food items are between $4-6. Not too shabby right?   I ordered the sliders and the Mezze Platter which is the hummus. The sliders came with two. They were good but a bit dry. i think that it needed some sort of sauce in it. The hummus was a tomato hummus which was also good and a very good size for $4. I only got through half of it. I also ordered their Cosmo. Delicious and was not skimped on the alcohol. Definitely got my $5 worth.   I think they should add a few more items to their happy hour menu. It wasn't a very big list. Other then that everything was good! =)"}
{"text":"We come here every so often mainly because they allow dogs on the patio!  It's always fun to have lunch with your puppy on a cool winter day (as opposed to warm summer day for those of you out there whom are not familiar with the valley).  Even though we started going here for the patio, it turns out that they actually have pretty solid food too.  The french dip and onion soup were both pretty good last time we were there.  Also had the burger and fries in the past, pretty standard faire, but none the less a solid choice.  They do a good job with these standard items and are what I would classify as mid/high end bar food.  I'll add, we always get great service which I appreciate too."}
{"text":"Been here many times, don't always remember to check in, but the food is always great. I absolutely love their Reuben sandwich. It's always fun trying new items here because this place has never let me down. I also recommended this place to my partner's parents and they loved it too."}
{"text":"Very yummy food in a faux pub environment. It's funny, they definitely designed it to look \"pubby,\" but of course this is the desert, so no one's buying that for a minute. Just good food, relatively large selection of beers, and a friendly wait staff.  It's also nice to have a patio where you can smoke. Given the Nazi-like stranglehold on places to eat and smoke, this is a Godsend. If you are a practitioner of the tobacconist arts, you definitely want to add this place to your list of acceptable stops."}
{"text":"First time here. Very good service and fast too. We had the dry rubbed wings. Honestly they were incredible! The tuna melt and fries were so good too! Real albacore tuna!  Comfortable and was a really enjoyable lunch. They offer daily lunch specials too. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went shopping in the area today, but my wife and I wanted to get something for lunch first and decided to treat ourselves to a sit-down meal rather than fast food for once. Very glad we did.  We started with the spinach and artichoke appetizer which also came with a fresh, mild salsa. Both dips were very good as were the tortilla chips.  For meals, she got the open face steak sandwich while I went for the turkey burger. The steak was cooked to perfection and was incredibly tender. The burger with chipotle sauce was also grilled and presented well. We both had fries which were flavored just right.  Our server was very helpful (even if she didn't know quite everything about the menu), friendly, attentive... everything that you'd expect from an establishment that has a goal of being part of the neighborhood.  Great atmosphere, great service, and excellent food. We'll definitely be back and may try their other locations as well."}
