{"text":"This place has gone down hill in customer service and Food prep. Was there previously and ordered chicken Korma which taste like chicken curry. The chicken tikka masala was nice and Paneer MakhanI was decent but spicy even though ordered mild for kids.Wife ordered Mysoor Dosa. Which took 50 minuites to come out. The owner was lost and he may have made money from us now but will be the last time. The Naan ordered came after 30 minutes. The waiter was rude and not interested at all.  This Restaurant was one I would not recommend to goto and will not recommend to cater at any event threw our entertainment network . They will just serve the food and screw up your night with bad service ."}
{"text":"had to write another review since there was a drastic drop in quality noted during our recent visit. 
visited on a weekend buffet; they had some vegetarian options including a paneer dish--this was completely bland and had an offensive smell; instead of chicken biryani, there was goat biryani--however, the goat was missing in that! on the side, there was mango shake--that was completely watered down; had a consistency of juice instead of shake!

the only good part of the buffet was the chicken 65 and goat soup.

however, after this experience, would not ever go back again; especially many other better places around in ballantyne/south charlotte."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Indian food and it was delicious!  Went for the lunch buffet and I'll definitely go back.  Plenty of options and the staff was fast and very polite."}
{"text":"This place is good if you know what to order. The South Indian food is spicy and they do it well however the buffet is not the best because there isn't much variety and don't have as much vegetarian food as you'd think."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst service ever.No one bothers to take the order and they are freaking slow in every thing."}
{"text":"The food is ok, not authentic. I was a regular customer until the lady who sits at the counter was rude to me. I pointed that out politely and she said that they receive too many customers and they cant speak politely to everyone. So, if you are looking for an example of how to turn away regular customers, this is your place. Will never go back, ever."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and spiced as requested . I  do wish the vegetable pakoras were made from big enough pieces to recognize the veggies. As they were, they seemed to be all coating. Hats off to the gulab jamans. They were light and not overly sweet.
A  warning to anyone wanting a 5:30 pickup when ordering online.  That time is offered but when we arrived we were told they didn't open until 5:30 and the chef had just started the preparation. My guests were due at 6:00 and I  had wanted the food already there."}
{"text":"Overpriced food full of chillies(preparation-H to the rescue).

We ordered a plate of Channa Bhatura and Dosa/Sambhar for starters. Unfortunately, thats where the meal ended, as well.

The Bhatura was a thick doughy ball, not cooked very well on the inside. The Channa's are better out of Trader Joe's freezer section.

The South Indian Coffee and Dosa Sambhar was average(the Sambhar and Coconut Chutney come in a doll sized petri dish.

The menu clearly states that all appetizers would be accompanied with a bowl of soup and Coconut Chutney. When asked why the Channa Bhatura was not served with the mentioned accompaniments, we were told that that was the old menu and now there is new ownership so the menu is not as it reads.

3-4 confused wait staff running around, with very poor communication skills.

When asked to speak to the owner, as it is under \"new ownership\", was told he is an absentee owner. The manager in a blue tee-shirt was constantly on his cell phone and couldn't be bother to speak with us."}
{"text":"I had the buffet lunch today and was really happy with the wide range of menu they had.I liked everything about the place actually"}
{"text":"Saag Paneer, Butter Chicken, Chicken Tikka, Hot & Sour Chicken Soup, and Garlic Naan - all amazing dishes with a ton of spices and flavor. Explosions in your mouth! 

Workers were nice and helpful too despite coming near closing time."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very tasty & prepared & seasoned as we asked.  Service was average & a little slow for an Indian restaurant. Good value for the price. Extensive menu."}
{"text":"Worst food ever .. Eggs are tastier than Biryani and in chicken biryani, even chicken is not well cooked."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!  Been there once before, service was slow, but food was good so we decided to try it again.  Seated and placed our order at 7:40pm.  At 8:25pm (45 minutes later), still no sign of our food, and our waiter hadn't ONCE returned to our table.  We flagged down the guy refilling water and asked him to check on our order.  After a few minutes he comes back and says \"It's going to take some time.\"  I tell him it's already been 45 minutes, so what's the issue.  He says \"There are a lot of people here.\"  I look around, and it's only about 70% full.  It's a Saturday night, it's not a big restaurant, so shocked that they are not staffed to get food prepared in 45 minutes.  We told the guy to cancel our order and that we were leaving.  

On the way out, I stop at the front to tell the manager we're leaving because of the slow service.  All he focuses on is what table we were seated at, then he flags down our waiter and walks away to talk to him.  Best I can tell, the only thing he was concerned about was making sure our order got canceled so they don't lose any money.  Well, they've lost our business going forward, so too bad for them.  Not an apology, not even a recognition of the issue, that's terrible leadership by this company.  

Guess we should not have given them a second chance.  They were even worse this time around.  

As a note, when we arrived, we ran into our neighbors who were waiting on a to-go order from the restaurant.  They said the restaurant told them 25 minutes to get the order ready, however they had been there much longer than that.  So at least I know it's not just us.  

If you're good with waiting an hour for food, enjoy this place.  However if you have reasonable expectations about service, then avoid it."}
{"text":"I have come in here multiple times, and each time the food surpasses the expectations.
Here are some of the highlights:

Lunch Buffet: this is the best buffet in the Ballantyne area. The last much hours are pretty busy, so I would suggest coming in a bit early. There plenty options for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. Being a non vegetarian , i gorge on the tandoori drumsticks. Dessert is usually one item like Gulab Jamun or payasam.

Chili Chicken: The taste is again great. We orders the spiciest level. Which was great too. I would suggest going for medium. Check out the pic of the chilli chicken dish.

Chicken Biriyani: this is their flagship dish, and boy they know how to prepare Biriyani. The consistency of the rice is great and is not dry, which most of the restaurant miss out on.

Mutton Biriyani: The one time I had it, I ordered it to go. It was a bit on the dryer side. But I would give it to them for this one dish.

Did I mention their app!!!

You can order to go from their app. And it works;)..
You can order to go and when the order is ready, they call and notify to pick up.

All in all a great place to be..."}
{"text":"Food taste in lunch buffet is so good and more vareity compare to other indian restaurtent. i would love to visit again and again"}
{"text":"The buffet was great and authentic. During the weekend they have Fish, Mutton soup and more deserts (Mysore Pak, Payasam). The chicken chops or \"tandoor\" chicken is tasty and has a good flavor. They served mutton soup on a Sunday which was great.  As I am from Chennai, I knew the mutton soup was actually \"Elumbu Rasam\" and tasted just like how my mom used to make. This was a pleasant surprise and had it after a long time. The Mysore pak was tasty and rich. I will definitely recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"My family and I went out to eat here in search of good quality Indian food, and decided to check this place out. We ordered butter chicken, lamb korma, and garlic naan. It was absolutely amazing, and exceeded our expectations. The service was also great. Our drinks were always full, and they servers always made sure we were pleased with the food."}
{"text":"http://www.charlottestories.com/10-worst-charlotte-restaurant-health-scores-july
Number 2..."}
{"text":"The dosa was amazing. The vada plate was really good.  I really enjoy me the service was prompt.  The biryani is so so but everything we had was amazing. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We've tried quite a bit Indian restaurants which offering lunch buffets. HBH is the best! Every single dish is authentic, flavorful, and satisfying. The chicken biryani is outstanding. Chicken is soft, and rice is fluffy. My fav is the gobi fry. It's crunchy outside and soft inside. Most important, everything is perfectly spicy and hot fresh! It feels like everything just came out from kitchen. We are going back tomorrow."}
{"text":"It's nice to have Hyderabad Birynai in Charlotte.
The service is very nice and beauty of the restaurant is Biryani means. Hyderabad Biryani and I like the lamb and shrimp very tasty of course with kingfisher . The guys who work there are friendly.
They use to offer discount every time as we visit frequently."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here probably a dozen times, and we keep coming back for more! Our favorite is the lunch buffet - the offerings change from day to day, and they are always yummy. It can get busy at lunchtime, but they swiftly clear plates and refill drinks. The buffet price might be slightly higher than other places, but the consistent variety and quality make it worth it!

We have been here once outside of the buffet hours for dinner. It was less trafficked at this time, and you can get your dishes spicier than at the buffet - which was great for me, but my spice averse husband had to find some yogurt relief for himself during dinner. :-)"}
{"text":"We went for dinner ....food was ok goat biryani was not upto the level
Mutton curry was full of spices and chicken chops had no taste just plain chicken,,,,Naan was soft  ... Seems the Nirvana (Previous name of restaurant)has been serving good food .... May be the new management will take some time to improve so don't go to the restaurant now

Also there is only 1 cook and 2 waiters they are struggling to manage they need little more patience with customers"}
{"text":"Went to pick up my food that I called in and the guy behind the counter acted like he was doing me a favor! Seriously ? You are in the service business you might want to tone that attitude down. I get it that we all have bad days but you are in the wrong line if you want to be an *bleep* to the paying customer. The food itself wasn't too bad but I might stick to Persis in Ballantyne where they are at least friendlier."}
{"text":"I had a \"to go\" order, the food was ok.I would like to know why I was given \"mayonnaise\" instead of \"coconut chutney\" for my dosa.Please don't try to fool your customers, might bite you back hard eventually."}
{"text":"Loved the food ( lots of variety) would give 5 stars for the food...but the service was bad...the waitress literally threw the plates on our table when we were sitting...smiling at customers may be too far a reach but can avoid showing rude faces.. I mean we pay to eat good food...
Never coming back again due to bad service.. Would not recommend..."}
{"text":"Good restaurant around in Charlotte.
Atmosphere, food and service all are good...
Have been here many times and like Veg items.
My friends also like Non-Veg items here."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a fantastic dinner here tonight. The food was great and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The waiters weren't outgoing and friendly at first - here in the south we're used to waiters and waitresses greeting us with a big \"how y'all doin'!\" - but after we engaged them they were very nice and offered several suggestions. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good spot, delicious curry , awesome lamb. And the rice cake is good too. I will try the lunch buffet next time"}
{"text":"Good food fast service, biryani was good! We had Paneer Makhani and Malai Kofta was delicious!"}
{"text":"We did birthday party in banquet hall and ordered Food from the restaurant...I really liked the food and ambience..The restaurant owner was friendly...I would like to go with them again....."}
{"text":"Stopped for buffet lunch today, food was awesome! Dosa, naan were delivered fresh to table (included with buffet) curries were delicious,, biryani was excellent."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Charlotte.   Casual place very tasty and authentic Indian food.  It has the best tasting food when compared to other Indian restaurants in Charlotte.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"I'm writing an updated review for Hyderabadi Biryani House to reflect my experience ordering off-menu, rather than just the buffet. For a full review on the buffet, read my earlier 4-star review.

I mentioned in my earlier review that I felt like the buffet version of Hyderabadi Biryani House's dishes were a little more bland than I'd like, and that's true as they are catering the buffet to a wide range of tastes.

I decided to try ordering takeout from Hyderabadi Biryani House for the first time just a few weeks ago, and it was FANTASTIC and perfectly spiced! I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Korma, medium-spicy, and both dishes were incredibly flavorful and delicious, rivaling the more upscale (and pricey) Blue Taj in quality.

I also ordered Samosas, just one serving, and was delighted to find they provide three full-sized Samosas in one order, instead of the two I was expecting.

While their Samosa quantity for one order is overly generous, one order of naan is one single flatbread, so if two of you are dining out, be sure to place one order of naan per person if you're into naan as much as I am.

The takeout portions of the main dishes exactly werewhat I expected, if not just a little generous, while the rice portion for 2 was just a little less than we ended up needing. It was easy enough to make some additional rice for my leftover meal.

Which brings me to another great thing about the portions provided for takeout: If I eat judiciously, there's usually enough for me to bring for lunch the next day, especially if we get an order of Samosas! I love that I can get 2 meals out of one order.

I've tried most Indian restaurants in the area, and Hyderabadi Biryani House is my favorite. Their prices are the most reasonable, and their food and portions are the best. I highly, HIGHLY recommend this restaurant, for either the buffet, or for carryout/dine-in!"}
{"text":"worst chicken 65 ever: How on earth is it a chicken 65 with no green chilies, cilantro and garlic. Its just a deep fried chicken with color on it. Sorry guys just coz people come out to dine this is how u serve food. one word for your restaurant, PATHETIC."}
{"text":"So good.  Tikka Masala perfect, basmati rice great, cut Mirchi Awesome!  I love the food here.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there with friends on Saturday afternoon expecting a great lunch buffet but we were greatly disappointed. We went there by 2pm since they only close at 3pm. They stopped refilling food by 2pm. Food was very cold. Vegetarians be ready to be highly disappointed. The only thing that was warm in the entire buffet was the plate. Plate is left there directly from out of the dishwasher. This is such a disappointment. I have been to this place several times and every time the management changes and every management has done a terrible job. Their alacarte is extremely expensive and food is sub par."}
{"text":"So finally I found a good Indian food place in Charlotte. Tried Hyderabadi style biryani and sheekh kebab. ... but the best part was the pudina (mint) chutney which was actually made of mint and not just coriander and onions. ... however a word of caution to all my American friends who are not used to spicy food: Make sure you tell the server to tone it down :p"}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Sunday. Ordered shahi paneer and special hydbd dosa. Everything lacked salt. The sambhar didn't have vegetables and was served cold. Even the potatoes served were sweet. The coconut chutney was watery and lacked the flavor of coconut."}
{"text":"So disappointed with the flavorless food. It's just drenched in cream. No spice at all. Bland bland bland :("}
{"text":"Good food... We tried few dishes and all were good. Try dum murg it was good. Place ambiance is not that great but food is good so go there early and grab a seat ;)"}
{"text":"Poor and rude service. Orders taken but no respect for customers on phone. Most importantly for a sanity check see how they are rated as of July 2017 - http://www.charlottestories.com/10-worst-charlotte-restaurant-health-scores-july/
But my rating is purely based on the worst service I received."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service, no respect for customers. 

I got to-go orders from here a few times and the food was just average...nothing worth mentioning. A few days ago though I went to dine-in with my two kids, and it was a disaster. After waiting almost an houe our food still hadn't been served, in spite of 3 reminders that we had been waiting a long time. Eventually they said they had \"forgotten\" about our order. I couldn't believe their callous attitude. Then he had the gall to offer me \"some discount\". I had two starving kids and a ruined friday evening, and it was now 9 pm. I promised him them an appropriate Yelp review and walked out. 

Never going back there, and I advise everyone to stay away....this place sucks."}
{"text":"This has to be the best Indian food i have ever had in Charlotte. The buffet is pretty exhaustive. Good value for money. Highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for good authentic Indian food. Thomas"}
{"text":"Just got back from here ! 

Brilliant food great atmosphere.

Service was good always smiling and pleasant.

Saffron in Charlotte used to be our go to place for a curry, not no more ! 

Will absolutely recommend to our friends."}
{"text":"I didn't even walk in the door and I received terrible customer service. I decided to call and ask about the ingredients (specifically the use of butter) and possibly some substitutions because my husband and I don't consume any animal products whatsoever, but the man who answered told me he would \"be right back\" and then hung up the phone on me.

I won't bother with this place when they refuse to even acknowledge my simple question over the phone."}
{"text":"I've been here for the lunch buffet a couple of times, so I can only speak to that (not the menu items or dinner service). 

However, the buffet is delicious and a really great value. There is a wide variety of vegetarian and meat options, plus limitless naan which is a steal in and of itself!"}
{"text":"great food selection waitress very knowledgeablewas first time there and had a awesome experience,had Lamb Biryani spice was just right"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me....Our last visit here was about 5 years ago. Even before  they took our order, we noticed the floors were full of old food and napkins. We decided to leave.  Tonight I thought we would give them another try. We walk and in and Judy says \"How clean\". We sat down at a dark table. The light bulb was missing. We changed tables. Judy orders the Lamb and I ordered the Chicken Biryani.  Judy's dish comes out but  my food nowhere in sight. Meanwhile, other tables who ordered after us were getting their food. When I asked where my food was, they said it takes longer and I should share Judy's lamb (I don't eat meat).  10 minutes later, out it comes. The waiter says \"Hot plate\". fine.. Part of the chicken and rice was ice cold.  I call the manager over. As he tries to explain why, he points to a nice size roach crawling on the table.  I told him \"we are out of here\". He wanted to prepare another order to go, but we just left. My original instincts were correct. They're other fine Indian restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Placed Togo orders and have had to wait upwards of 2 hours even after being promised that order will be ready in 40 mins. Order was placed around 6pm, so it's not exactly rush hour
Customer service is severely lacking, there is no one to help you out and they would not even think of apologizing for any delays
Orders were messed up too and finally on the quality of food - considering the wait time, lack of service and price , I would say it definitely is sub par"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet! Go. So delicious. I have the chicken tikka masala with rice every time but do try other things! Wasn't spicy which was fine for me! Oh don't forget to have some naan

UPDATE: they seem to be under new management. Chicken tikka masala is sweet now and they are giving out bottled water which is probably better but not a good sign that they have clean water. I have gone before they gave out bottled water and I could never have ice because there was always debri in there that would begin floating in my drink."}
{"text":"Here for a pre-order and empty restaurant. I was told to wait for 5 minutes for my order and I ordered a chai that took 20 minutes and we waited over 30 minutes for a pick up order that was suppose to be ready and waited. Servers were not helpful and staff is rude. Not worth it"}
{"text":"I have been here for 5 times almost, it's really the best place for biryanis in Charlotte. 
If you really wanna have perfect Hyderabadi Biryani [Any flavor ] this is the best place in this locality."}
{"text":"Been twice for lunch and dinner.  Chicken tikki marsala made to your liking (mild to spicy).  Lunchtime buffet was really good.  Only thing I suggest is they have sweet tea on hand (this is the South) - had to wait and tea was warm.  Need ice in tea and water."}
{"text":"The Buffet was amazing. Flavor and the heat was spot on. I can't wait to try the buffet on the weekend"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I've dined here on at least five different occasions, during lunch and dinner service, and I have never been disappointed.  During lunch, they offer A buffet, which I surprisingly enjoy.  I typically don't like buffets;however, this one is well-maintained has delicious offerings and is well maintained and kept fresh.  During dinner, the service is very good and it is an enjoyable dining experience.  Try the spicy naan and the chicken tikka masala!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was a bad day. Normally the food here is good as we normally get the chicken tikka masala and saag. App for ordering did not have this readily available the on the menu. Placed an order via phone at 5:40 PM and they said 6:10 PM. Needed to be home by 6:30 PM, left at 6:30 PM with no food."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Prefect Hyderabadi Biryani. Cut Mirchi, baby corn Manchurian tasted awesome. Ambience is great. Service is awesome. Taste is superb. Price is reasonable. Will visit again. Charles was the manager at the restaurant and he too excellent care for us."}
{"text":"I decided to try Hyderadi Biryani House and was very pleased with the lunch buffet. Wide selection of dishes and the food was fresh and had great flavor. The place had a nice crowd for lunch but the buffet was always well stocked and fresh. I tried several of the entrees and they were all excellent, even a couple of the vegetarian ones. Nice decor and good service (water refills). I am a Fan!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday evening As soon as I landed in Charlotte I was so hungry and we decided to have Biryani. My fiancé suggested this place for best Biryani(which I doubt him) which is too far from our place. We ordered Chicken and Lamb Biryani for pickup. It tastes amazing and definitely worth going that far again."}
{"text":"We have visited this place for dinner and ordered hyderabadi biryani.the taste was awesome.we will visit this place again to try other dishes.spicy level and everything was good."}
{"text":"I loved their buffet I had last week. Their pudiogray rice reminded me of the traditional cooking you would find in southern India. While I did not try any of the meat items, it certainly did look appetizing. They had onion pakoras on their buffet menu and I was a little surprised and happy to see them. It's usually an afternoon/evening snack. But nonetheless, it was one of the best pakoras I've had in the US. Not too oily and appropriately spiced.

I will be coming again."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, which is unfortunate because the service is so painfully slow. There is very rarely many people in the restaurant, but still expect to wait 45+ minutes for your food to arrive at your table. Even ordering takeout takes that long. I will intentionally wait 35+ minutes before even leaving my house to go pick it up and yet will still have to wait another 15-20 minutes once I get there. Add this to their fluctuating health inspection scores (they were down in the 80's this summer) and we've just stopped going."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. First time doing take out, horrible wait service. Wait was 45mins, as told, but waited an additional 30mins when I got there. It wasn't like there were a lot of people dinning in. There were more take out orders, and everyone had to wait additionally while we were there. Food finally  was ready, but there the garlic nann was a small single order, so I added 2 more. Was told it would be another 5min... it was like 10-15mins! How is there not just a ton of garlic nann under a warmer ready to go! Poor people in he restaurant were waiting forever for their food too. I don't think anyone was actually eating. Will not be dinning in or take or ever again with them!! Should have just gone to Blue Taj."}
{"text":"Food is good so I can give one star. Always went there to get food but last time we picked up food they missed one dish and it was late so called them to tell them. They said sorry about the mistake and they will give the dish next time we order for free. Went today and they had too many questions and took off $10 while dish was $13. It's not about money or the $3 but more about principal. They made a mistake and acted like we are some kind of scammers. This was last time we come to this place. When you eat out you want food service which it seems like this please does not have."}
{"text":"My first visit to this restaurant was for their buffet lunch.  They had a fairly good variety of dishes, but around 2:15-2:30 (their buffet ends at 3) it seemed like I was scraping the bottoms of several dishes at the buffet.  Like a lot of other Indian restaurants in Charlotte, their food was good (not great), service was mediocre to poor but the restaurant appears bright and clean."}
{"text":"Very very good lunch buffet.  Best lunch buffet in or around Charlotte.  Lots of choices.  Good quality.  Def worth coming for a lunch or two a week.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Finally made it for dinner.  No buffet that night.

Had a nice chat with the waiter.  We both like bindi, which is a sauteed okra dish.  He frankly told us that when okra is out-of-season that they use frozen.  We decided to await springtime to come back for that one.  His candor truly impressed us.

We ordered the yellow lentils (they were our of black lentils) and set the spice level at 3 of 5.  The lentils blew our socks off.  We added rice as that cut into the spice and then gently tried our 3 level madras chicken.  That dish was fine, spicy but not killer spicy.  Our conclusion is that the lentils were more of a 4 or 5, so ask if this happens to you.

We were told that they would exchange the item if the spice was our-of-bounds.  Nice.

We were the only \"gringos\" in the restaurant until we were leaving and another non-Indian couple entered.  This is an authentic place that draws ethnic customers...many families.

We noticed that the menu emphasized vegetarian \"Southern Indian\" dishes.  Yes, there were offerings of seafood & chicken, but the thrust was vegetarian, so vegans...delight here!

Also, they have more than the standard \"naan\" bread.  They have \"kulcha\" breads which are stuffed naan.  Our onion kulcha was well dotted with onion, but it just appeared to be just part of the dough looking like a regular naan with onions.  Thought it would be puffier with the onion \"stuffed\" inside a folded or rolled naan.  Just so you know.

Good place, great buffet where you can try it all, but also a nice dinner option."}
{"text":"Really bad service.  Samosas were extremely burned. Korma tasted like it was from a jar.  It was bad when it was called NIRVANA and is equally as bad under this new name/management.  We will not go back again, even if it changes management for a fourth time since it's been opened."}
{"text":"Good food. Loved the paneer tikka and veg biriyani. I would recommend having their Madras coffee as well, reminded me of the authentic filter coffee back home. Finally feels like I have found a good Indian restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We've had takeout from here before and it was good. But this was maybe the worst Indian buffet I've ever had. Mostly meat. Flavors were off. Some of it obviously sat for a while (we got there at 1:15). Wait staff is rude... Our \"waitress\" had ear buds in. They didn't even ask if we wanted anything other than the buffet. I'm guessing most of the good reviews for this place are unrelated to the buffet. Leave a wide berth.

Update: as we were leaving, another member of the staff was rude. 1 star now and won't get takeout again."}
{"text":"Tastes ok but this place is always a problem in refill the dishes during buffet... Takes at least 30+ minutes to refill.  During my visits they did once and other times not refilled even when I finished lunch leaving the place.  I think it's their strategy 
NOTE : careful while using soup bowls/plates, they need to clean their dish washer first before they clean plates/soup bowls."}
{"text":"Loved it. New favorite Indian place. Birini was fantastic. Came for lunch on a Saturday."}
{"text":"I came for the lunch buffet after my friend informed me, that this is the most authentic Indian food she has had besides her mothers food....AND it did not disappoint! Every single thing I had was delicious!"}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte for the day and looked for Indian for lunch. Wanted a buffet as I was on my own and pressed for time. One word. Wow! As a vegetarian I frequent Indian Restaurants because of choices and I love Indian food. Hands down some of the best vegetarian choices I've seen on an Indian buffet. Great flavors, fresh and lots of options. Next time I'm in Charlotte this is on my list!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations since this is a chain and since I just moved from Jersey I thought may be this will be my go to spot. But i quickly doubted that decision after I tasted the Shahi Paneer we ordered, if I could describe how I felt when I took the first bite of it: it felt like i am eating gum mixed with heavy cream including chewy tiny peices of paneer!!! I mean Where in the world is this Shahi paneer from!! Another disappointing item we ate was the chicken 65, it was weird in its own way. The whole night I felt uncomfortable and coukd have puked any moment. 

Mr. New management at HBH, you need to taste the food you are serving, and review the rating"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT! The food was absolutely digusting, the taste was fine but finding hairs in my food ruined it. Also, the staff was very rude."}
{"text":"This food is so wonderful and also has vegan and vegetarian dishes!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here when visiting charlotte. This restuarant is located in south of charlotte. 

I have heard about their biryani and wanted to give it a try.

Ive ordered a togo 40mins before going to that place and yet they made me wait for another 30 mins. Which is fine as they tend to get busy some nights but the young lady working there was apologising and providing free soda to this guy for the same reason, while neglecting others. That is not a smart move and i believe you should treat every customer the same way. I havent been acknowledged nor even asked my name interim time by her. 

Keeping aside the story, the biryani itself was pretty decent. I wouldnt say the best but you can give it a try. There wasnt salad provided with it. If you are one of those who likes salad, do ask them specifically instead of being disappointed later.

Overall not a bad place to have indian food minus the service. Atleast in my exp wasnt the best."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian restaurants in Charlotte. The service is superb, truly professional. The food is excellent with a wide variety of dishes that are all distinct. The staff is welcoming to everyone and very patient. 

Spiciness is variable to one's preference. I usually like spicy food and it is perfect when I order spicy. Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"I have visited this place for weekend buffet lunch and have had nice experience, however dinner alakarte experience is really bad, service is careless and ignorant, served wrong dish, serving spoons are missing every time a dish arrives on the table.."}
{"text":"This place is just horrible for takeout. 9 times out of 10 it's not ready when they say, so we typically come 15 minutes after the time so we don't have to wait around for the food. Costumer service is awful, as well. We wouldn't have returned if it wasn't so close to where we live. 

Our last time getting food from Hyderabadi Biryani, my wife Chicken Vindaloo and received shrimp, instead! The container said Chicken Vindaloo, and she didn't realize until she started eating. What if she had a shellfish allergy?? That's a screw up you can't come back from. 

Never again."}
{"text":"So we went for buffet on a Sunday and I must say, this place is very very impressive. To begin with we had the typical so called Indian street food \"pani-puri\" and the chutney water which is to be served with is was really authentic. This is a must have for starters. They also had samosas in the buffet. Being a big fan of meat, I directly jumped over to the meat section of their buffet. I was looking out for the usual tandoori chicken which they did not serve on Saturday, but instead they had something that's called Chicken chops. This was probably the 1st time i have had the chops at an Indian buffet place. They are a must have for meat lovers. The chops were made from Indian spices and were truly delicious. They had goat curry, chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala and the pepper chicken. Tried all of them and they were really good. The pepper chicken was so well cooked, it forced me to have them again in the second serving. They also had fish fillets which were very tasty. The layered coating on the fish had good spices to it. Also, for their deserts they have malai gulab jamun which is something you usually don't get to have at the other Indian buffet places. The desert were fresh and warm enough. Not to forget they were tasty too. 

I did not eat much from their variety of vegetarian food on the buffet menu. They had puri, sambar, veg noodles, spinach with green beans, papad, and vegetable biryani. But if you are a meat lover, then this is your place to go. Try the goat curry if you have never had it. The service is good. The server politely asked if we wanted water / soda. Also to let you know the indian bread (naan) is served on your table each time. We had to ask for napkins however since those were not on our table.

The ambiance is decent. You can go in a group to this place. The pricing is $$ on the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian buffets I've ever been to. It's very small and was pretty busy when we arrived. There was a pretty large selection of all amazing dishes."}
{"text":"The food may be decent but their service / people working here are completely clueless. I've ordered takeout a handful of times and have been disappointed every time. I literally walk in and the people working there have no clue where my order is or if it even exists. There is ZERO communication between their employees and they leave patrons guessing / trying to convince their staff that we did infact order at it should already be ready. My last order said 15 minutes until it would be ready and I still waited almost an addition hour (50 minutes) until the food was actually done."}
{"text":"We ordered to go. It was ready when we arrived, as promised on phone. 
The food was fantastic! We ordered veg biryani and a couple of masala dosas. All came out pretty good. Biryani was a bit spicy(the way it supposed to be)."}
{"text":"I have revisited this place after long time today for buffet.The food was so delicious and they have wide varieties of items in buffet like South/North Indian all type of  food they are serving and Great service too!!."}
{"text":"We came in town and thought to try it out.... cute little place. The staff was very nice. The food was good. We ordered a few different dishes. I would say, the best was chana. This was flavored well and came with a big piece of bread. One thing that was annoying, we were a party of 5 and all our food came out at different times. Our last dish came out when the rest of us were almost done. They were not even that busy so that was just a little annoying and that's why I give them a 3 star instead of 4."}
{"text":"Beware vegans and vegetarians! 

At lunch buffet today, I found chicken in the dish labeled vegetarian. It was a veg puff and it had chicken inside. No one felt bad or apologetic. Just took my plate away when I mentioned and replaced it with two veg puffs which I didn't want to eat."}
{"text":"I am a health conscious eater and a vegetarian..... I like this place and has now become one of my favorite places to eat. The food quality is excellent, freshly made and well balanced spices, not too creamy.... most indian restaurants tend to make vegetarian curries creamy and that's not good and it kills the flavor and I don't prefer creamy dishes for daily meals... Also very few dishes have food coloring in it...

They have a decent lunch menu (vegetarian),  and if you are looking for something home cooked style (healthy and delicious) then this is one of the best places to eat"}
{"text":"Amazing food. We had take out and the food was ready very quickly. It was all full of flavor and so fresh. The chicken Tikka masala was perfect. Plenty of meat and the sauce was so tasty. Definitely going back for more!"}
{"text":"We got a take out from here, while we were driving through Charlotte. 
Goat and Chicken Biryani tasted really good. Had the traditional hyderbadi flavors (Unlike other places). Quantity is more than adequate."}
{"text":"The food honestly was pretty good. We had a bunch of appetizers and tried the biriyani. Pretty decent food, no complains on that front. 
We checked in on Yelp once we were in the restaurant and received a 10% off deal/coupon on Yelp.
However the business refused to honor the coupon. It was a current coupon with no conditions yet we were told it is an old coupon.
It was a rather uncomfortable exchange and I believe the business behaved unethically.
Also, yelp needs to make sure it gives out coupons/deals for trustworthy places who will at least honor them.
Disappointed."}
{"text":"Hi i had chicken biryani here a couple of times and the taste is the best that I had over in us. The best part is that they also provide lunch deliver boxes to downtown and they charge only 7$ including delivery charges. For a guys like me who loves biryani and hates cooking at home this is just wow. Don't worry the quantity is also good for a lunch appetite."}
{"text":"Management changed  food items reduced and taste ok..I visited before new management .Food was so so.Some items are good.Will recommend this place."}
{"text":"For the most part I enjoyed the buffet. I don't remember a lot of details, but do recall there being some unusual (for a buffet) items such as fish masala and idli/sambar, all reasonably well prepared. I also remember thinking, however, that there wasn't much in the way of vegetables, and that certain staples like nan and pakora were underwhelming."}
{"text":"We went to buffet. Food is a paradise for both indian and other crowd. My group had indian and Chinese people. They all loved it. Buffet is $12.99 and its worth it. I would come back again to this place. They need to extend their time to accommodate more people."}
{"text":"The chilli chicken was good and up to the mark. The biryani Was properly spiced but a little less on the number of pieces in it and the masala. The take home option was a bit delayed as it took them almost 45 mins. They did treat us nice with a complementary mango lassi while the wait. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We had visited this place for buffet lunch on Saturday. Biryani tasted real good. This is one of the best food i have had in Charlotte after a long time. 

Ambiance was good and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We went there on a Monday evening hoping for a good experience and was let down. The service was spotty, an employee was going through paperwork right next to us, and the place was empty. We asked about alcohol and were given two options: red or white wine. We got white wine and it came out in tiny glasses (and was likely boxed wine). This typically wouldn't bother me, but what did was when we got the bill. They charged us almost $9 a glass for the wine! Our mediocre meal of Chicken tikka masala and biryani with wine included came out to almost $70!!!!! And the waiter initially tried to not show us the itemized receipt (we had to ask for it)! I felt used! Never again."}
{"text":"I went on a sunday for the lunch buffet. There was a party going on too in the banquet hall.

1. Food was not getting replenished fast. i had to wait, remind , wait for the food to get filled up...
2. shrimp curry was just water, no flavor. shrimp wasnt cooked well.
3. only thing that tasted good was the chicken kabab and chicken 65.
4. lamb biriyani didnt taste good,no flavor.. meat was over, little rice left (they didnt get new stock until i left)....
5. not once staff came to check on us

overall experience not good...."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch buffet on weekend which I highly recommend. Not much options on week-days. Very cosy n intimate atmosphere at night. Food is awesome at any given time. Spice level can very depending on your preference. We prefer mid-level and it works for us n our 6 yr old too !!!   Taste is awesome .. be it be non-veg or veg dishes.

Must try Items for Non-Veg
Goat Curry, Goat Piper Fry, Dum biryani, Chilli chicken etc"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today. My wife ordered chicken curry and I tried the buffet. Lots of options and the buffet was popular today. I tried most of the food and brought some home as well. Great flavors. Some had heat, but not too spicy. Nothing I had was bad. First time I had goat and it was good. Reminded me off park. It was all very flavorful. I even brought some home for dinner. The wait staff was helpful; but not as proactive as I would prefer. Still, because they were not busy they did help us with questions and service. They were friendly and the manager even walked me through the buffet choices and told me about each one. Nice place to stop in and dine or do take out. I would recommend you try it."}
{"text":"I have tasted indian food in many restaurants but this has unique taste. Buffet menu was good. Especially for veggies. 
Management and service is good.

Visited again for dinner in a week apart. South indian tiffins were awesome."}
{"text":"The service here is fantastic and the food is even better! Keep up the great work team! I can't wait to come back for lunch. The lunch buffet is great.  That Kheer is calling my name..."}
{"text":"We used to eat here quite frequently, however we then began going to Blue Taj, which is my opinion is better food and definitely service. We ended up at hyderabad biryiani last night and had one of the worst experiences we have ever had. We arrived and we're seated and the table hadn't been set. We ended up grabbing cutlery and napkins from another table. We were given water pretty quickly but our drink order and food took a out 10 or 15 mins after we got our water. We received our beer and then began our wait. After about 45 mins we inquired about our food, and my husband asked for another beer. We were told it would be ready soon. After another 30 mins (during which time my very pregnant friend had to get up and get her own water because no one came by to offer us any more, and my husband left to go to the bar to order his own beer)we finally received our food. There were no apologies until my husband said something to one of the waiters. To be fair, my husband because a bit rude to the staff because by this point we had been at the restaurant an hour and a half at least. We finally ate and asked for the bill which was not seperate (we went with another couple). Another 10 mins passed and we finally went up to the cash. The service was terrible and I doubt we will be going back. Please sort out your wait staff and/or kitchen staff. You guys were great 9 months ago...something has obviously changed and not for the better. There was also another table beside us and they were not happy with their meal either."}
{"text":"We have eaten thee a few times but rely on them for weekly meals for my husband, who is Indian. The last two weeks we ordered the food is not the same, two times we have ordered Pakoras to get nothing the veggie was nothing but deep fried scraps from the Buffet and the Chicken were never included. When we contact the restaurant through Foodie Call they are always rude to us and Foodie Call.
   We are never given enough rice for all the curries, we get 8-10 entrees to cover lunch and dinner. Our driver has to beg for extra rice, I order food mild and even the Samosas were filled with pepper flakes. It does not matter if you order mild or Indian because it is all the same. We have never had the buffet but have realized that if you order delivery while the buffet is going on you don't get what you order, you get what ever they have on the buffet. They have just changed the take out containers to smaller sizes, my husbands Goat Byryani had 3 pieces of bone in it last night. 
    I am posting this as we are not spending 25.00 our orders are always 150.00 . So we had hoped they may be concerned about customer loyalty but it seems not, when the Chicken Tikka Masala is a spicy as Pepper Goat it is obvious they don't care about the clientele or repeat business. This seems to be the pattern with Indian Places in Charlotte, start out great, then tank your health score and blow off your loyal customers. Never again"}
{"text":"At lunch time they serve an excellent buffet which I highly recommend. It's usually pretty busy during lunchtime, which should tell you how good the food is. 

At dinner time it's usually slower and quieter with a more intimate atmosphere, the menu is largely the same except without the buffet. Wait staff has always been warm and friendly and very helpful with questions about the array of dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Food is ok ok.. we went around 9:15 and the waiters looks so tired - somehow they managed to take all our order. Chilli chicken and chicken biriyani are nice .. chicken chops are Ok ok .. goat biriyani is bad with over cooked goat .."}
{"text":"This restaurant has sub par food quality, terrible service and average ambience. The food price is too high compared to the quality of food. The host and waiters have an attitude problem with lack of passion to provide any service. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant. Love this place. Very good, tasty and authentic Indian food. Saturday buffet is awesome. Better than Persis"}
{"text":"Went to this joint for their lunch Buffett. The variety of food was impressive but some of the items looked like they were not fresh. They were out of few items (paapadums) without a timely refill. I really liked their Mango Lassi and the fresh bread they deliver to the table. Overall the food tasted good."}
{"text":"Worst experience with this, i have ordered lunch box and waited about 40 mins no response nothing , please don't choose it"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Their southern indian dishes were on point. I'm looking forward to the next time I'm there to try out their other dishes. Samosas were amazing!"}
{"text":"One of the good Indian restaurant in southern Charlotte. My favorite dishes are chicken biryani, fish fry, chilly chicken. They also have pretty decent buffet, which I think is little higher on price but sometimes justify with food quality. I had mixed experiences here .. most of the times on positive side."}
{"text":"Buffet is not for vegetarians. Huge disappointment. Rice was hard from drying out. Veggie dishes were mushy and cold. Crowded and awkward. Staff is not helpful. I recommend takeout. We usually order and pick up which had been delicious. We won't eat in again."}
{"text":"If you haven't made it to this restaurant in the 8 months that they've been open you NEED TO EAT THERE NOW!!!! The lunch buffet has a great variety!  And the food falls nothing short on ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!  I'm not familiar with Indian Cuisine by name. But I've had experiences with other restaurants in the area. And none come close to this.

The food has such great flavor and spice! And the atmosphere is casual and relaxed. But the place is very clean. I would recommend this place for someone who is searching for a new Indian it place."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite for Biryani!!
Yummy always, optimum spicy as when it comes to chicken biryani ti has to be spicy so its optimum spicy. I like the sauce or curry that they serve with the biryani which is very tasty. 
this place also good for dinner time for family and kids too."}
{"text":"The best buffet food around Ballantine area. Since we try food here we keep come at list once a week sometimes twice a week. Good variety on the buffet and price is fair. They also catering too"}
{"text":"We order takeout from here quite often and the food is always delicious.  Good size portions and always seasoned perfectly.  In fact, we went to another trendy local Indian restaurant Saturday night and our bill was well over $100 and the food was not nearly as good.  We will definitely not return there! My only complaint would be that you must order food to be delivered through a third party service and it sometimes takes forever.  Other than that, I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We went to taste biriyani a core item but it was not there. There was a Birthday party going on their customer service is very poor. Restaurant was very loud. Food is not worth for money paid. Buffet was very average and very messy"}
{"text":"literally my favorite spot to get biryani outside of Hyderabad! obviously the biryani is amazing and the dosas are out of this world. I come here at least once a week. The service is amazing and the staff are very responsive. 10/10 would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Eww, food was okay, biryani too much spicy it' doesn't taste good, nan bread sucks.
Service was good.."}
