{"text":"I choose to eat here because it is new. Well I have to say they have a lot if work to do. I ordered a Bang Bang shrimp wrap. It had three shrimp in it and it tasted like I was eating a salad. No BANG at all. The fries that I got for a side was by far subpar. They did not even give me a full portion. I had to ask my server if that was right. The service here is not good at all. I have had to flag my sever down just to ask for a second drink. I don't think that I will be eating here in the near future!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a date Thursday, we chose to eat here because it was new and we wanted try something different. It used to be a restaurant called sagebush and we never got a chance to eat there when it was the sagebush. We should of went to Chili's or another restaurant. We both ordered burgers and I ate half of mine, I had a cheese burger. The food was nothing to write home about. The fries were nasty, the seasoning was awful. The only thing I really enjoyed besides my drink was the cheese fries that was good. My husband is not a picky person and he even said the food was not good! I would not go back and waste my money there. The music was country music and it was very loud. I felt I have to scream at my husband so we can hear each other.  I can't complain about the service the girl we had was really nice. Like I said I will not be back I can live without this place!"}
{"text":"We tried to go here when it first opened, tried to leave a review on yelp but it was too new and unlisted. Colleague and I went during lunch, apparently they had just opened that week, front doors were still getting locks installed. We were greeted, seated in the midst other tables and that's about as far as it got. We stared at the menu for almost 10 mins, no one came to get our order. No one came to get our drink order to begin with. Could not even flag down the waitresses as they were too busy flirting with other guys and all congregating in the corner. We got up and left, clueless waitresses and hostess at the front door thanked us for coming and our business. Can't recall ever having such a bad experience at a restaurant. Good luck."}
