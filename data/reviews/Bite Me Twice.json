{"text":"I've been there for lunch twice so far and both times have been great.  Freshly prepared food, good selections, and the prices are right. I can recommend the corn chowder soup as well as the chicken curry wrap. Looking forward to trying their breakfast some day."}
{"text":"My review was filtered by this site for whatever reason.  Please note that I indicated in my first review that the food was fantastic; I have no issue with the food quality, cleanliness, or any other aspect of the physical establishment; however, I take issue with the lack of customer service of the owner and believe it is most prudent to alert others to the potential for a hostile experience at this cafe.  I am pasting my original review below.

Excellent food but beware....should you have an issue with your meal not being prepared per your specifications....the owner is extremely rude and unprofessional.  I have an extreme allergy to milk and when I received my wrap it had cheese on it.  I very politely requested a new wrap be prepared at which point the very helpful counter server went into the back to advise the owner of the request,  With a fairly full dining area, the owner began to shout and scream at her employee stating such things as \"she can't afford to continue to make new sandwiches for customers\", \"it's not her fault\" all of which the entire cafe could hear.  
I asked to speak with the owner at which point she screamed out \"what now\"  After a very brief exchange of words (which were completely hostile on the owner's part where she advised she didn't care if I suffered severe allergies) she grabbed the sandwich and slammed it on  the back counter and instructed the girls still yelling to make me a new one.  
On principal alone I will not return to this establishment.  Very disappointed and disgusted with the owner's attitude."}
{"text":"My son,  his friend and I went to this restaurant for breakfast on a Saturday morning. We were really happy with the service. My son's friend is celiac and they went out of their way to accommodate and make sure his meal was gluten free.  And he was amazed they went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Not always the case when asking for gluten-free options. I had the western omelet, my son had the smoked salmon bagel with cream cheese and his friend had bacon & eggs and gluten-free toast. All was very good, and not greasy at all. Loved the coffee too! 
I am a new resident of Oakville and will be coming back with my Hubby for sure!"}
