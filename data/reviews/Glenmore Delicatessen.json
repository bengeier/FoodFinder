{"text":"Yep, what they said.  Good old, down to earth sandwiches with no surprises.  I liked how everything is sliced right in front of you.  I like how the lady is friendly to everyone but sometimes when the lineup is long and you're in a rush then it can get a little irritating when she's trying to catch up with every customer.  But all in all I love having this little beauty right around the corner.  A solid 4 stars"}
{"text":"Wanna know something? I heart this Deli! I was delighted to find it here because I think more people need to eat the sandwiches made at this place. (I'm a sandwich nut, it's everything I like to eat on a daily bases smushed between stuff that I can't get enough of.)

If you happen to be trolling through Ogden and are hungry, you should stop at this Deli. At first blush, you'll think this place is sketchy because it's in a sketchy parking lot. Let me assure you, it's not sketchy.

It's run by a woman who is either an Australian who spent too much time in Quebec or a European who spent to much time in New Zealand... either way, it doesn't matter because wherever she's spent her life, she's spent it learning to make a great sandwich. 

She has a nice selection of cheeses, meats and breads for you to pick from as well as classic veggies and spreads and some interesting fizzies and juices in the cooler. For about $10 (cash only ps) you can get a giant, fresh sandwich, a drink and a chocolate bar.

Don't expect a gourmet sandwich a la Downtown, or strange and unique selections, this place will make you a down-to-earth meal with fresh stuff at a decent price. You'll even walk away with the little brown paper bag to prove it; all it needs is a nice note from mom.

{"text":"OMG this place is AMAZING. Best sandwich place in the Foothills Industrial Park by FAR. The owner Lydia is so nice and caring; she will remember your name after only a couple visits. However it will be a couple visits a week if you work near here. Everything is fresh, really fresh, healthy and delicious.

Lydia gets new ingredients each and every day: fresh buns, meat, cheese and veggies. She slices everything in front of you, the cheese, meat, tomato, cucumber, onions, pickles, etc,. Nothing is pre-prepped. It is instead made fresh for you to your specs.

She has a HUGE selection of meats and cheeses - Swiss, provolone, cheddar, Havarti, and more. Turkey, Ham, Authentic Montreal Smoked Meat, and more...

Prices are also really good; $5 for a sandwich, $6 for one on a triangle bun, or croissant, and $8 for a big sub. All stuff includes GST and it is a CASH ONLY business. Hours are 6am-2pm Mon-Fri."}
