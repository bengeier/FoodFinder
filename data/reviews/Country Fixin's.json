{"text":"If you are looking for great homemade food off the beaten path this is the place to visit. It is a mom and pop diner with affordable prices. I love visiting places in the country, and so far this was the best one I have come across!"}
{"text":"Beyond disappointed. First of all the temperature inside was not much higher than outside, which was below 0Â°. We had two children with us, one being 18 months old and the waitress brought cups without lids and placed everything in front of the baby. We ordered breakfast and the sausage looked like it was deep fried Brown and Serve brand. The bacon was also deep fried. The fried hard egg we ordered for our child was over easy. We did not eat, left and will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue, especially since I've been coming here for quite some time now.  I love country fixins! It's quiet , convenient, and SO quick. The owner, Patty, is running this one woman show. I come here quite often so she always greets me with my coffee and takes me order immediately. The food is ready in no longer than 7 minutes and everything is always right! I always order the Sunrise Special with scrambled eggs, bacon, and Italian toast. Recently I ordered a side of home fries and that was the best decision ever. The home fries are so fresh and crispy. I'm obsessed! I also order the BLT sometimes and it is also always cooked to perfection. Crispy bacon, crunchy lettuce, warm toast. Perfect! The BLT is also served with a side of chips  Patty treats you like she's known you forever. She is so sweet and knows everyone in town. I'm so impressed with her business skills, cooking skills, and people skills. Country Fixins gets a well deserved 5/5."}
{"text":"A little hidden private restaurant in Cecil. The breakfast was plentiful and quite delicious. Everyone seemed to know each other here and were very friendly. I highly recommend trying Fixins for breakfast and or lunch. No dinner is served here."}
{"text":"The 2 stars is for the sweet man serving coffee. Off the beaten path? Definitely! Here's a quick summary from someone who's not familiar with the area.  -tap water served from the questionable faucet next to the coffee pot and cash register  -accepted cash and cards -very affordable (coffee, corn beef hash [2 tbs scoops] for $7.90 plus tip) -seems to have ample parking before lunch -appears to have a solid local customer base -since I sat at the bar, I definitely heard the microwave being used quite often  -quality of the food is okay.  Would I go back when I'm back in town? That's a hard NO."}
{"text":"Stopped here on Memorial Day for breakfast with my sister and her family. We went earlier and were the only table. We were greeted quickly and all ordered something different from the menu so that we could try a few things.   I got the breakfast burrito and coffee. The burrito was very large and tasted great...my only suggestion is that it have a few less potatoes in it (or get them on the side) as they took up most of the burrito.   The cost of everything was under $40 and we all left stuffed!! This place was a great homemade spot to grab breakfast and we all decided we would be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Got here around 10 and it was dead then everyone started to come in and everyone knew everyone it felt so at home already with everyone being so friendly. There was even a few regulars helping out with coffee refills. There was two lady's working taking orders and cooking the food. the food was out in a fast time and it was great! Everything from the eggs to how fluffy and golden brown the French toast was awesome. The only thing I can complain about was the bacon was really over cooked and did not seem fresh and the sausage was a low grade meat but other than that everything could not have been better. the prices where pretty cheap and reasonable as well. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We ordered four breakfast platters for pickup - they included pancakes, bacon, eggs over easy, sausage and breakfast potatoes.  Everything was delicious. Prices were reasonable and the food was ready when they said it would be.  Will definitely go there again next time we are in the area!"}
