{"text":"Glad this is a new lunch option in West Akron. Very good BBQ and sides for a fair price. If you are wondering, this place is like a Chipotle of BBQ where it's fresh good food, served casually. My favorite item was the green beans, they had a nice flavor and done perfectly. My brisket sandwich was good. My colleague had pulled pork and a mountain of fries which he really enjoyed. Service was efficient and friendly considering they were super busy. We sat outside on the nice covered deck."}
{"text":"Great addition to the area. Tried the General combo? I think that's what was called.. Brisket, Pulled pork and chicken good.. The ribs are okay.. ribs seem frozen by the bone and dry. Great choices of sides and sauces and core bread was good. Nice atmosphere & staff. Just hate when all stores clean dine in area  before closing time while I'm still enjoying my dinner. Will def come back and a must try!"}
{"text":"Best brisquit around. Great greens and potato salad. Plan on waiting in line. Well worth wait"}
{"text":"As someone who eats barbecue fairly often, I was excited to hear that a City Barbeque would be opening in my area. I had never eaten at a City Barbeque prior to this, but I had heard stories of their legendary fare, so I had to check it out. After having eaten from this place twice now, once for free before they opened, and once more recently, I'd say they mostly live up to the expectations I had... mostly.   The first time we went for our free meal, they gave us each a bag with a pulled pork sandwich, Mac and cheese and a coupon for free sides next time. I thought the pulled pork was a little dry, but I may have not used enough sauce since I was eating as we went down the road. The Mac and cheese was pretty good. The pasta was cooked well, and it had just the right amount of creamy cheesiness I like in Mac and cheese. I liked the barbecue sauce they gave me quite a bit ( the original sauce, I assume) but not as much as the spicy sauce I tried on our next visit.   The next time we visited, I decided to get the pick two with sausage and pulled chicken. I also got a side of baked beans and hush puppies. When I first got my plate, I was a little Leery of the pulled chicken... it looked kind of like a mystery meat that would come out of a cafeteria at a small school. Despite the suspicious look, the taste was nothing short of great. When I ordered it, I was expecting what you get at any other barbecue restaurant which would be just some plane pulled chicken with maybe a little sauce. This seems like more of a casserole too me, but it's definitely the best pulled chicken casserole you'll ever eat! The sausage was about average based on other restaurants I've tried. I don't think they offered a spicy variation of the sausage, but I think a spicy sausage would really add to the overall flavor. I feel as if the current sausage is too heavily reliant on the sauce. I'd say the highlight of my meal was definitely the baked beans with brisket. It's not easy to find barbecue restaurants around here that make that kind of baked beans, and I wish more would. They were packed with flavor, and cooked perfectly with an amazing texture. The hush puppies were good, but about the same as you'll find at any other place like old Carolina.   I hope as they go on, they get a little more organized in the dining room. Many of the sauces were messy and empty. Other than that though, everything appeared generally clean. We'll definitely be returning here in the near future!"}
{"text":"The sides are good generally, brisket isn't great but the rest of the meats and ribs are pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of City Barbeque for years and would make sure to stop anytime I was in Columbus.  Finally they've moved a bit north.  You can taste the smoke and subtle spices in each bite.  There is no need to cover everything with sauce.  However if you like sauce they have several options there to, each one really good and unique.  The sides are all good.  I especially like the baked beans, you can taste the molasses in every bit and the greens, which are hard to come by here in the north!  There is another chain which specializes in BBQ in the area, City is hands down better than that other place.  It is not even close.  When you are in the mood for some great barbeque stay in here."}
{"text":"Online ordering does not allow for selection of sauces, the brisket was dry, and the to go set up is not tuned to handkerchief the sauce and side cups... lots o bags... but they did leave out the plastic ware as requested. We decided on the $28 sampler  Plus 2 extra sides... so many to try. .. Easily enough food for 6 people  Cornbread was soft, sweet and moist.  Creamy coleslaw and Texas toast were forgettable.  Beans & brisket and Mac & Cheese were both thick and rich and wonderful.  Pecan slaw was soupy with not enough kale, but mixed well with the creamy slaw... hard to believe but it had too much fruit and nuts and not enough slaw crunch on its own.  The Regular Sauce and Sweet City sauce were super powerful. They overpowered any seasoning on the chicken or brisket.  The brisket was dry, but the pulled pork and ribs were super moist.  Chicken was ok... but not as good as our local birds... would love them to smoke a bird from one of the farms within 10 miles that have lived happy grazing level snd have tasty meat.  We will return... maybe someday they will be slow enough we can eat in house... but all in all the take out is a better alternative than the wait."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, my husband and I have been here 4-5 times since they opened. Last weekend we took both of our inlaws for dinner. There were 6 of us in total and we ordered by couple so there were 3 orders. Somehow one of the orders for my in-laws got duplicated and  I politely said, \"That order was already filled.\" The lady who seemed to be the manager was very busy, but this seemed to annoy her. She literally turned around and threw the whole tray of food in the garbage... It was filled with items that were also on the order I was waiting on. I couldn't believe it... In the world we live where people are going hungry daily how an entire meal could just be thrown out like that in front of a whole crowed of people... We love the food, but it will be a long while before we go back."}
{"text":"I ordered online and the website was very easy to navigate. When it cans time to pick up my order, I was very nervous just because I didn't want to wait in line. Pick up was fast and super easy. The food was delicious. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"If you are really a meat Fan. This is your place!  Don't miss it. So good food. I would come back here forever.  Staff very helpful and friendly.  Outstanding experience!!!   5 stars"}
{"text":"I had the bbq chicken with a side of potato salad. The chicken was juicy, soft and delicious. I felt no need to add any additional bbq sauce. The potato salad was okay, nothing special the potato salad from Diamond Deli is much better. I also tried a brisket taco, the meat was juice and tender but lacked flavor. The tacos of pretty small, three bites, but the tortilla was cooked well, so it was soft and complimented the brisket."}
{"text":"Great BBQ joint to hit our area, it's definitely better than Old Carolina in my opinion. The brisket is delicious, a little dry, but the flavor is great. The ribs are also really good. I love their sauce selection, and their sides are good too. My husband said the greens were good (I'm not a fan in general, so I didn't try them), the hush puppies were amazing-I could eat those little halls of heaven all day, but unfortunately the mac and cheese was just so-so. I can't quite put my finger on what's in it that gives it a \"different\" taste, but it isn't good. I have a friend who went on a different day than us and she said the same thing. So, that's disappointing. The only other thing I have to complain about is the fact that we ordered a pound of brisket and got charged extra for 2 buns...honestly, come on now, giving your customers TWO buns to go with the meat they purchased so they can make sandwiches is kind of a given.  All in all though they have really good BBQ and we will be back...often!"}
{"text":"This Texas girl couldn't wait to try the new place in town and so there I was for lunch on their second day!  I had the best brisket sandwich that I can remember! It was wonderful - moist, tender and had just enough smoke flavor.   They have many sauces, my favorite was the spicy one.  Collard greens and potato salad were good sides and I look forward to trying more of the options.  Service was smooth and very friendly.  I will happily return here!"}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ!! Line moves fast and food comes out quick. Had the pulled pork, brisket, hushpuppies, green beans, baked beans, collard greens and Mac & cheese so far. Everything has been delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We went to city barbecue Saturday in Fairlawn Akron for a friends birthday and was a little disappointed, the pulled pork was really good but the ribs were dry not that great of a taste and you actually had to chew the meat off the bone where as even when you Buy them from a grocery store already made up the meat would fall off the bone and really not that bad of a taste W try it again later and see maybe if they might've been just a bad day for them.  Since I had a reply from city barbecue I will up my rating  to A four star because usually people don't really care enough to reply but I will stop by again and try it out again soon, thank you for your reply."}
{"text":"Food was ok kinda cold by the time we got our order. They ran out of most meats and sides which is ridiculous!!! Hello you are a restaurant!!  Wait was unorganized and long to get order.  Will not come again. Very disappointing!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If the free smells driving buy don't get you, the pictures certainly should. This new quick eat gem is a welcome addition to the Fairlawn area. I've never been a fan of local competitor Old Carolina but there has never been much of a choice when it comes to low and slow barbecue around Akron... until now.   This place is truly mind blowing. Don't worry about traveling to Kansas City or Memphis to get good barbecue. It's now in our backyard. The pulled pork will knock your socks off. All of their sides are exceptional. Staff is friendly, helpful, and plentiful. We will be back until we bust."}
{"text":"Been there twice. Once when it first opened and was ok. Second time was worse. I thought I would try the smoked pulled chicken. I asked the server what she thought of it? She said it was nasty. Wow, I asked if I could have a sample of the pulled chicken. It was discussing. They have chicken legs,thighs and breast and that was ok but the pulled chicken is throw up food! I'm just not impressed with city bbq. I have had much better luck with Mission BBQ, Brew kettle, Oak and Embers or the mom and pop's roadside bbq's of the world."}
{"text":"City Barbeque in Fairlawn is a wonderful gift to the area for barbeque lovers. My wife and I enjoyed one of the best pulled pork sandwiches we have ever had last night. The portions were abundant and filling and not the typical shredded or minced pork you so often find in \"pulled pork\" offerings elsewhere. After living in metro Atlanta for more than ten ten years we visited many barbecues.  This one betters what's typically found in the big chain restaurants that dot that area that prides itself on southern fare. Like everything my opinion is just one perspective but if you are looking for great/enjoyable barbecue the City Barbeque may soon become one of your favorite places. Try the sweet sauce it is a perfect compliment for the juicey chunky pork that tops the bun or Texas toast."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the Akron area! Quick, clean service. The staff is very friendly- I saw a few of the workers go over the check on the guests while they were eating. It's always nice to see the staff care about their customers, even when it's busy! They have a wide selection of meat, and southern-style sides. The portion sizes are plenty, but they have bigger options such as samplers. They make their own BBQ sauces. I would suggest the sweeter one, but it doesn't taste like your average honey BBQ. The mac n cheese is a go-to, along with the green beans with bacon. I'll definitely be coming back here."}
