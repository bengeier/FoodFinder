{"text":"Its a nice little place at the corner of King and Colborne. The decor is really nice and the service is really great too. However the food wasnt very memorable - at least what i had.

I had seabass which was really great. But the fish came with its head and tail which was a litle unexpected but not a deal breaker. My friend had the homemade pasta which was quite nice too. 

Over all the meal and the experience there was nice but i wouldn't go back there (only because there is so much more to try in the city) and i would highly recommend it either - there are very many options out there."}
{"text":"This place looks great and the food is even better. Really love the home made pastas. This place is worth every penny for sure. Food is excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with friends. Had their $15 prix fix lunch menu:
Appetizer was a small bite size straticella cheese and tomato on top of crostini
Main, I shared roast chicken and spaghetti meatball. Both were really good. Surprisingly chicken was really juicy! Dessert, I chose small canolli. 

Service was excellent, food was very good. Overall, I think $15 for lunch at such a restaurant is good value. Osteria is a trendier restaurant, price point is just a little higher than casual dining. If you order off the regular lunch menu, plates are $16-25."}
