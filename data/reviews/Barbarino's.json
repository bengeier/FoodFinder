{"text":"Great local restaurant!  I love their Italian Wedding Soup.  I always get a pizza with light cheese and it still tastes delicious!  This is one of only two places where I can still eat delicious pizza without lactose intolerance problems!"}
{"text":"Great local Italian restaurant.  Staff is always very friendly and accommodating. Food is great!"}
{"text":"Love coming to Barbarino's! The food is excellent! Everything from their traditional pasta dishes to their giant (delicious) wings to their speciality pizzas, is amazing! Their beverage offering is also fantastic with bartender specials and seasonal favorites offered through out the year! The atmosphere here is really wonderful, as well, with a spacious outdoor patio to enjoy during the warmer months and live music featured weekly! The staff is very good and attentive and the owner, Kevin, is often present and happy to chat! Check this local gem out and enjoy all it has to offer!"}
{"text":"This is a stand up business. I ordered a white pizza with chicken, black olives, onion, and artichoke. When I picked up my order I thought they had given me the wrong pizza. It turns out that they had made the wrong pizza entirely. They made a new pizza and refunded my money. I wasn't asking asking for anything but the fact that they went so far to satisfy a customer speaks volumes about the way this business is ran. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food has always been okay but the service is not. It seems we always have the same waitress every visit and we are made to feel like an inconvenience and there is no communication throughout the meal. It's weird. But the pizza and wings are okay but we wouldn't make a special trip based on service. Haven't tried any of the entrees. Just don't feel very welcomed when we go - maybe take out is the answer?"}
{"text":"Not a fan. The pizza was just ok. What I can't get over is how nasty this place is. I wanted to take a shower after going. The table was so sticky that my arm kept sticking to it. It smells, and the kitchen looks like someone got murdered in it. Surly there's got to be a health code they need to pass, right?"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I won't be back because of it. Ordered a pizza for pick up. They told me twenty minutes. I came after 30 minutes and was told I was a few minutes early and the pizza wasn't ready yet. When I pointed out I was in fact late, they admitted to burning my first pizza and threw in a second one as I was standing there, after having paid. They were not very accommodating, did not offer a refund or any sort of compensation for the extra 15 minutes I waited. This to me is just a common sense thing to do. Most other places would've at least tried to make it right. One of the boys working there said a manager would come out, but no one ever did. I would be more understanding if they were super busy but there was nobody in the restaurant dining in (this was before 5pm) or picking up carry out."}
{"text":"Plain and simple this place sucks.  The kitchen at it's best produced mediocre 'italian' pub grub. At it's worst the cusine is inconsistent and sub par.  To add service is slow, mgmt/ owner rude.   Save yourself the agravation and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My girlfriend Lisa and I went here for the $22 strip steak dinners. 1/3 of her steak was pure fat!  The steak had good flavor, but 1/3 not being edible? Terrible value and ruined the birthday dinner. The baked potato was tiny like the potatoes one buys at the supermarket.  They do have good bread, the caliber of Santo's Restaurant.

We have been to this restaurant before.  We will not be back to this restaurant.   The owner was shown the long cut of fat from the steak and had nothing to say. What could he say?  Poor quality, poor steak value, but service was descent.  Complete waste of money and at best worth half of the +$50 paid!"}
{"text":"I live close by and thought I'd give them a try. I wasn't very impressed. The wings were very soggy and the bones split in your mouth as you ate them. The pizza crust was undercooked and wasn't very tasty. I went to the restaurant to pick up my food and the d√©cor was very dark and outdated. The staff were very unprofessional and rude - they were actually laughing at me in the kitchen about a question I asked.  It does look like they have a nice patio but I haven't been back to try it.  There are better pizza options in Olmsted Falls."}
{"text":"Been here many times. However, we have not been here for awhile. My wife's dinner was good. Big bowl of pasta that looked more like soup than pasta. She said it was good though. We will add noodles to the sauce and have lunch so that is good. My dinner Veal Parm, on the other hand was a big pile of breaded veal. More breaking than veal and to make matters worse then reading was very salty. Sad to say we would not recommend the food. By the looks of all the empty tables (not normal years ago) everyone else feels the same way."}
{"text":"Someone call Robert Irvine quick. This restaurant is in desperate need of a Restaurant Impossible makeover. The decor is extremely tacky, can we say a Santa in a hula skirt.  Prices were high and food was bland. I had the chicken piccata. The chicken had no seasoning and was borderline inedible. The waitress was rude and uneducated about the menu."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for this restaurant and I like to try new places, so we thought we would check this place out. We went on a Friday night and sat out on the patio. At first glance thought it was a cute little Italian place. They told us they would have music later, but we opted to sit outside because it was so nice out. The food was very average. There was a cream sauce pasta which was good, but the pasta with the tomato sauce was very bland. The salads were iceberg lettuce with hardly anything on them. The food was not what you would expect from a nice Italian restaurant. The server took awhile to get to us. He forgot to bring us the waters we asked for, until about 15 minutes later when we had to wave him down to ask again. My first wine glass had a lipstick smudge on it so I sent it back. When the server came back he made a comment \"I think I brought the wrong glass for this type of wine, oops hehe.\" I had realized it was the wrong glass before he came over anyway, which isn't a big deal, I'm not that picky, but the fact that he didn't even offer to correct the problem is clearly not good service.

After all of this we were thinking this restaurant wasn't very good and we wouldn't come back. Then we got our check. They had charged us 50 cents extra for each glass of wine, so we were over charged one dollar (two glasses). While one dollar isn't a lot, when I pick something out on a menu and see a price, that's what I expect to pay for it. We asked our server about it and he told us that it was because a band was playing so on Friday and Saturday nights they charge an extra 50 cents for each drink. At this point the band had JUST started to play and we were outside so we couldn't hear them anyway. Regardless of whether we could hear them or not, that should obviously be printed on the menu! The server walked away after we paid, and never returned. We saw the hostess cleaning a table nearby, and asked her if there was a manager we could speak to, as we didn't think it was right to charge us more than the menu price. She left, and after awhile came back and said the owner was not there tonight and the manager just gave her 50 cents to give back to us. This was so insulting. What kind of manager doesn't even take the one minute to go talk to a table, or look at our check to see we were overcharged for 2 drinks, not one? And then to just send the hostess over with 50 cents was infuriating. We left the 50 cents on the table and walked away. I have never been so insulted by a restaurant manager. I'm not sure if it is even legal to quote one price and charge another. Obviously we will never return, and tell all of our friends and family about our bad experience."}
{"text":"There are not a lot of options in the area so we were delighted to find another place to eat, but this place went downhill fast. 

Their pizza is good, but it always takes longer then quoted and their pasta isn't anything special. The only time I ordered a sandwich their was a hair in the fries so I didn't even eat it and they were pretty rude about it. I wont be returning."}
{"text":"Wonderful food that comes out piping hot; caesar salads that are the best of any other restaurants; service exceptional; cozy atmosphere; more food that you can eat so that means leftovers!  Consistent food as well as consistently good service.  Nice bar and outside patio for those who like that.  Would highly recommend that, if you haven't been here, you should try Barbarino's."}
{"text":"live in california, visited parents july 4th, took home pizzas from barbarinos, are you kidding me!  incredible, open a  shop in San Fran! delicious! cant wait to visit cleveland area again to get that pizza"}
{"text":"I almost never write bad reviews. When it comes local places, I want to like them. The pizza at Barbarino's has been good in the past, but ordering the flank steak I felt totally ripped off. The steak was cool, the vegetable was sliced zucchini with no seasoning, and the garlic mashed potatoes were crushed, boiled potatoes. No cream, no garlic, no seasoning, just smashed potatoes. For 19 dollars it's not acceptable. The place has ambiance, but the 96.5 Kiss FM with commercials killed it."}
{"text":"Danielle and I (mostly I) wanted to try a different Italian place tonight. I'd never been here and some of the reviews had me a little scared. I'm glad to say it was actually pretty good.
Danielle just got spaghetti and meatballs. i tried her meatball and it was ok. I like them a little more dense. I had the angel hair ala vodka. also pretty good. lots of sausage in the sauce. i also had a cup of French onion soup which was pretty tasty as well. nothing mind blowing, but the service was good. the food was good. we will definitely consider going again."}
{"text":"I got some take out pizzas from Barbarino's on Saturday. I must say the pizza was really good - WAY OVER PRICED, but good. I would actually say it's the best mom and pop pizza around. While I was waiting on my pizzas, I enjoyed a few beers at the bar. The bartender was nice and helpful (I think her name was Sara) and was willing to assist me with some special instructions on one of my pizzas. The bathroom was disgusting, this is a must fix for the owner! Boogers on the wall -never a good thing and it looked like the urinal hadn't been cleaned in days (it had a beard).

All in all the food was good, but $51.00 for 1 large one topping, 1 medium cheese and 1 small cheese and 3 draft beers is WAY too expensive."}
{"text":"So the staff is very friendly I'll give them that. It was very cold in the restaurant. The food was mediocre and the portions were decent. Not the best place for Italian food and a little overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"ordered $15 eggplant parmesan that was soggy and cold. Told the waitress and she took it away and brought it back. Assuming it was microwaved.. it was still cold.  Way overpriced average bar food. $6 for a pint of beer! Salad that came with the meal was wilted iceburg.  And the bartender didnt say much for giving me cold food twice.. love the their patio though"}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant. We arrived at 630 on a Monday evening and it took our server Danielle over 15 minutes to even greet us and bring our drinks. We waited for bread over 40 minutes and an hour for our food. She wasn't even competent enough to refill our empty soda glasses, another server had to refill our drinks and bring ketchup to our table. Aside from us there were only two other tables in the entire restaurant. While the food was good, our server was the most incompetent moron I've ever met in my life."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try during Christmas shopping 2 days before Christmas. While the service and food were decent, the actions of the owner ruined our whole experience. We saw him actually screaming across the restaurant at a patron in front of her baby and small child. Apparently he was kicking her out for a suggestion of all things, a changing table, which any restaurant has.  He had the nerve to ask why she brought kids to a bar. A bar? Far from it! Seeing the way he treated this woman was despicable and abusive to the point of driving her to tears. Warning to every family with small kids/babies, stay away. Not only will you not have anywhere to change your child, but you're subject to yelling as well. Disgusting. Not only will I never step foot near this place, I'm warning everyone in every group on every social media outlet to beware of this ass that clearly is in the wrong line of business."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  Not a good night tonight.  Came tonight to sit on the patio and listen to musician.  We asked the hostess if we could sit on the patio and she said there's only one table left and it's too big for 2 people.  So they stuck us back in the corner of the restaurant.  The next party came in (2 people) and she seated them on the patio.   So ok, ordered our food.  They brought my cup of soup and our drinks.  And then we sat...and sat...and the waitress said she was going to check on our food and she went out to the patio to help the people there several more times.  Time passed.  The hostess was clearing the table next to us and we asked if she could check on our food or better yet bring us the manager.  She said ok and continued to clear the table.  More time...the waitress came around and said \"I've been trying to get your food out of them\".  The owner came to our table and said our food was done.  My husband & I  said we would pay for what we had eaten and forget the food.  He argued with us about how many minutes it had been, only 25 he said (for chicken and a burger).  Case closed.  We paid our $13 bill for a cup of soup and two drinks.  Sorry won't be coming back.  Too bad.  We've always liked their pizza."}
{"text":"Barbarinos has always been a favorite of mine, but ever since they remodeled and added a patio it's gotten even better.The food is good quality and their pizza is simply the best. I recommend the homemade manicotti or Pasta Beverly. They also have a full bar and a newly added martini list. The owners are very cool people, and it always feels good to support a family business. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Overall quality and value good. We really like server Nicole. We've had her on our last three visits and she is fantastic!

The presentation is top notch. We like the casual atmosphere!

They have a great customer reward program!"}
{"text":"Barbarino's is one of our favorite local restaurants. The food is always good and reasonably priced. The staff is friendly and helpful. There is always something on the menu to satisfy your craving and the pizza is great."}
{"text":"Ok, I did not like this place.  Let's get down to it!  Went there with my wife and 11-year old son who is NOT a picky eater.

APPETIZER. Uneventful cheese sticks. Not good, not bad, just ok.

SALADS. Wife's Caesar salad came out 10 minutes after the other salads.  And it was only lettuce, dressing and croutons. And didn't look very appetizing.

ENTREES. Son had cavatelli and meatballs, the sauce was so watery we sent it back. (about an inch and a half of standing water in the bowl)   Wife had a small cheese pizza that was over cooked.  I had the chicken francaise which was actually pretty good but I ended up sharing it with my son since we sent his meal back.

Even after they removed the cavatelli from the bill it was still  $60."}
{"text":"Barbarino's has consistently good Italian food.  Side salads are very big and fresh.  bread is fresh loaf out of the oven. yummy.
Their Italian food is really good, served up in cool big bowls and plates. The place had a facelift and looks great.  The bar is really nice, almost classy looking.  The owner has been there for years and is dedicated, present and very involved.  Wait staff are great, many have been their for years.  The patio is awesome.  We eat outside most of the time in the summer.  Good wine selection.  If you like different menu items try their specials.  It's pretty good.  Oh they had a good band playing music you can eat to."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and pasta! The Barbarino pizza is awesome! Love bands on Friday, nice cozy casual Italian atmosphere. Great staff! I have been 3x since I moved to the area last month and plan to continue to come back."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty tasty. Our neighbors always order it for our block party and people seem to really enjoy it. I've never eaten in, only pizza take out."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, I want local places to thrive and try to support them. That being said, I'm not going back to Barbarino's. Ambiance ok, relatively clean, good service. Worst food value I've had in a long time though. Got the chicken picatta, which was a flavorless chicken breast in a watery lemon liquid with a dozen or so capers tossed in. Baked potato fine, salad was returned due to matte of slimy lettuce buried in it, blue cheese salad dressing tasted like Kraft's with not a blue cheese chunk to be found, complimentary bread is just sliced white bread. Wanted to sub smashed red skin potatoes that come with other dishes on the menu for my baked potato, but was told no due to expected business of kitchen (it was a Friday night and the place was mostly empty). All this for $17.50. I literally felt like I was being conned--that price was so out-of-bounds for what I got. Heed the warnings you see here. Barbarino's might be a fine stop for locals to get an after-work beer, but that's as far as I'd go."}
{"text":"We went to Barbarino's when they had their wings on special.  I was 8 months pregnant and I heard the owner yelling at the young waitress that I couldn't get the wing special because \"you have to have a 2 drink minimum\".  The waitress told the owner \"she's pregnant she can't have 2 drinks\". He then yelled \"well she can't have the wing special then\"."}
{"text":"Catered my Mom's 60th Birthday and also my Dad's retirement! Amazing food and a wonderful friendly accommodating staff! Thank you guys!"}
