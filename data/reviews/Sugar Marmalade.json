{"text":"The food and dessert is good in both variety and quality. I got the mango black pearl and it was very good. My friend got the black sticky rice in coconut milk and it was also top notch. The server was also kind and served us well. It is a small place but very cozy and clean."}
{"text":"After I finished drinking, I realized that the sticker of the mason jar is still intact, never touched water. That means the mug has never been washed, straight out of the box from the warehouse."}
{"text":"Sometimes, appearances can be deceitful. I tried their waffles and had higher expectations. Their waffles weren't very fluffy, nor were they sweet and near the middle of the waffle, it tasted a bit alcoholic. I asked the waiter about the ingredients and later, the chefs came out and told me that it must have been the yeast (?) lifting sauce, but they offered no refund. My friend and I had waited for over 30 mins for that waffle and never will we order it again."}
{"text":"Oh man. Probably gonna give this place a 1.5/5.   We came in right when they opened at noon and it was just us for a while but it quickly got crowded (which I thought was a good indication of the quality of their food). Each table has a buzzer you can press to call the waitress but to be honest I'm not sure what it's purpose is cause the waitress never comes anyway. After placing our orders, the waitress informed my friend that they currently do not have tapioca and since her plate included tapioca, she would need to choose an alternative so she opted for grass jelly.   I ordered taro with coconut milk and it came after about 10ish minutes but my friend's order still hadn't come. After a few minutes, my friend's order came but without the grass jelly. We pressed the buzzer but the waitress only came cause we got her attention but we told her about the grass jelly and she took the order back. Lots of time passed and passed and still no order so we figured they were re-doing the order.....even though they just needed to add in grass jelly. The waitress didn't tell us anything so after 20 minutes my friend wanted to cancel her order because we needed to leave soon and the waitress said she'll go check on her order. I had a view of the bar so I saw the waitress lingering there for a while waiting for the order to be completed and I just couldn't wrap my head around why it was taking so long.   Anyway, the order finally came and it was ok but my friend paid. When the waitress came to collect the card machine and receipt, she was thrown off that a tip wasn't added so she asked us to tip her because \"every table has to tip\". Lol. I dunno it just wasn't a good experience and it's gonna take some convincing for me to go back."}
{"text":"Lucky Yelp doesn't allow me to rate this zero star. Otherwise I would rate this place zero. The food is taste very very bad, nothing is fresh made.    I ordered Mango pancake with sundae supreme in the menu wrote fresh mango that why I order it. However, end up is the mango is can mango. The pancake is full of whip cream I can't taste anything but whip cream. My friend ordered stewed egg white with milk and ginger. It is way way overcook. Chef mike (microwave) over heat it.   This place is a terrible place for food and I keep hearing microwave beep sound. So chef mike is the head chef of this place"}
{"text":"I love Sugar Marmalade.   Their menu is delicious and there's a great variety of desserts. I would highly recommend their Taiwanese popcorn chicken for snacks, and my favourite dessert is probably their mango pancake.   The staff is friendly and they always do their best to seat you as soon as possible when it's busy. I notice that they all say goodbye when you walk out that door. I've been coming to Sugar quite often and it's one of my go-to places to eat when I'm eating with a friend. There has only been two or three incidents where it was moderately busy and our server forgot to give us our water (in one case) and didn't tend to our table after we had called (in another case).   Overall, it's a nice place to eat and the service isn't horrible."}
{"text":"The desserts are alright, but the service is a let-down. I've been here on two occasions. The first time the service was barely satisfactory, and the second time, we just left after 10 minutes of waiting for service after sitting down. The wait staff, who look and act as if they are customers themselves, served a group of 8+ people who came in 5 minutes after us. Clearly they have their priorities, so we didn't want to bother them."}
{"text":"Called to order and request for delivery in Mississauga location as on the menu said that they do delivery, found out that they don't deliver. Disappointed and upset. They should of put a note on menu that they don't do delivery at Mississauga location, wasted my time to call. And last weekend i came to Mississauga location, as on website it said they open till 2am but they already close at 12. What kind of business is that?"}
{"text":"I use them for the desserts.  Yummy oreo coffee milkshakes with tapioca seeds."}
{"text":"That picture was ice cream with grass jelly, sago, black and white pearls in coconut milk.  Not bad,  pretty good but nothing really exciting about it.  Lol  Order the mango aloe vera drink with pearls as well.  Again,  nothing really exciting about the drink.  Very typical dessert mango drink.   Also ordered the stewed papaya with milk.   Location is pretty good... on Yonge in between Finch and Sheppard (closer to Sheppard actually).    Price is reasonable... same as any other chinese dessert places.   Will I come back... only if in area and craving dessert.   But,  will not go out of way."}
{"text":"This place has really good desserts and tasty snacks but the service seems really slow, I asked for water and they gave me not even a full cup more like less than half. I will come back again just for the desserts though"}
{"text":"- Nice environment - Taste - it's really good - Price - reasonable - Quite a lot of choices - I will definitely visit again since I want to Try other kind of desserts"}
{"text":"Came here on the opening week with a party of 2 when there was a discount promo going on for checking in on facebook.  Having never been to the location at Yonge I thought I'd give this a try.    All the seats were full but we decided to wait it out, although we were the first ones to wait in line we quickly got a seat within a couple of minutes.  Service was  pretty prompt and the interior looked very modern, trendy and clean.  The moment I sat down there was a huge durian smell, I guess it was very popular at the time of sitting.  Also their menu is huge compared to the other dessert places i've been to.   The food here was delicious, everything from the whip cream, mango, durian and even the frosted flakes were all fresh. Though I'm not a huge fan of durian, it was very sweet and high quality durian. I guess that is the upside of coming to a newly opened restaurant.  On top of that our bill was 20 or 30% off (cant remember) which came to around $10 for 2 desserts. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Arrived a little after 6pm on a Friday, table for two. It wasn't busy so we were seated right away. The edge of every other table contained a fixed button that you would press to call for service. Not once did we use that device as the servers were proactive and just an ear shot and wave away. Very zen and simple furniture.  All hail the Japanese teriyaki French fries! Crispy, savoury and most of all addicting. The perfect balance of Japan and crinkle cut fries. It's an appetizer so don't expect this to fill you up.  For dessert I ordered the Strawberry banana pancake w/ Sundae Supreme. After the first bite I was forcing myself to finish this. The inside was filled with settled airy whip cream with just a couple banana and strawberry slices. Best part of this was the ice cream on top which I combined with my partners sago.   As we left every coworker from the floor to behind the counter would say \"Thank you buh bye!\" I found this really cute. And to me this was complementary fortune cookie at the end of the meal   TL;DR *Proactive customer service *Get the Japanese teriyaki French fries! *Unsatisfying Strawberry banana pancake w/ Sundae Supreme *Zen environment  Thank you buh bye!"}
{"text":"Great dessert place, highly recommend the green tea shaved ice, however I didn't particularly enjoy their savoury foods. Rice was mushy at best and the wasabi that topped it was too strong in my opinion. Also, the service during business hours is quite slow so I do not recommend attending during lunch or dinner rushes. Once again the dessert was still amazing and decor was awesome. Loves the black and silver look."}
{"text":"This place is literally horrible. I ordered a cheesecake and it took them 20 minutes to bring me it, not only that, i saw them heating up my cheesecake in the microwave. My friend and I wanted the egg waffle topped with icecream at first; however they ran out of egg waffles, then we decided we wanted to get wings and kimchi fries until they told us their fryer is broken. There honestly isn't much in this place and the food is not good.. at all. We had to wait atleast 20-25 minutes just to get our food even when it wasn't as busy. All the servers are so quiet and they never come up to us, there was so many miscommunication where they brought us the wrong order and then told us we had to pay for it regardless but of course until we got frustrated and they apologized. Overall, food isn't great, customer service is horrible, and it isn't worth waiting 20 minutes for just a cheesecake."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Been there before, but today went for takeout and portion size was significantly reduced. Ordered the mango pancake supreme, got home and saw they forgot to give me ice cream..."}
{"text":"This is my second visit. Food was average but if ur craving for Asian style dessert this is the place to go. Dishes that hv mangoes are pretty good. However their matcha red bean shaved ice has no matcha taste at all,  it only looks green.  The milk green tea was ok not the best but it's not nasty.  I'd say the pricing is a tiny bit high comparing with the portion n quality that u get.  But overall it's average not bad,  hey free WiFi is always handy."}
{"text":"We wanted to grab dessert here but the service turned us off. The waitress was rude and were talking about us as we left, thinking we couldn't understand them. Given there are so many dessert options on yonge, I would expect them to be more polite. Lets see how long this store can last w that attitude.  Not even worth the one star I HAVE to give them"}
{"text":"One star is even too much. The WORST EXPERIENCE ever in my life. They seem to think that dessert is served at the beginning of the meal. And the drinks at the end. They think they can serve you warmed up food and pass it off as fresh made."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to trying Sugar Marmalade out because I'm a fan of Asian desserts such as black sesame ice cream and black pearl pudding.  The location of the restaurant has plenty of parking and is also located to other restaurants which is a nice if you want to eat elsewhere and come to Sugar Marmalade for dessert. The restaurant upon arrival was super busy on a Sunday night. The interior of the place isn't anything fancy. Just basic looking tables and seats and not very spacious.   When my table got seated, we weren't told about the process of ordering. We didn't know we had to write our orders down instead of telling our server nor did we realize we wouldn't get any service at all unless rang on the button buzzers that they have on the side (which don't really work tbh because you have to ring it a couple of times for them to notice you). Some clarification would have been great since we were first timers.  The menu offers an extensive array of desserts as well as mixed beverages. Unfortunately, a lot of the menu options were not available which was a bummer. My family ordered the black sesame parfait, condensed milk toast, and taro black pearl pudding. Everything was pretty good except the mango in my parfait tasted like it was going bad.   Overall, I would come back if it was less busy. Since it was so busy, service was nonexistent so I'm hoping it will be different when there is less of a crowd."}
{"text":"Excellent place ! Highly recommended , good food and nice service . Sad they don't do delivery if you don't live near by ."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to hear that a new restaurant has opened in Mississauga and will be opened until 2 AM (As advertised on their company website). I visited the location and upon arrival, we were greeted by a server and was informed that the kitchen is closing soon and to order any entrees   ASAP. We were told that the desserts were still available to order later. However right when we sat down, a waitress approached us and rushed us to order the entrees without giving us a minute to look at the menu. Soon after we ordered our desserts and drinks, of the 5 items we have ordered, 2 were not available. I ordered an Original black milk tea with tapiocas. I am aware that bubble tea is not their specialty but the tapiocas were hard and definitely not cooked, the black milk tea itself had a strange aftertaste. I do not recommend the black milk tea at all. I also ordered a mango cheesecake and New York cheesecake. It was nothing too special about it.  At 1 AM, we were handed the bill and rushed out, even though the website had advertised that they are opened until 2 AM. I suggest them to change the location hours on the website as it is false advertisement. Not seeing myself returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Worst day ever, when i go in i ordered, and i ask the waitress \" why the water is not serve yet?\" and then the waitress reply me : oh, if you did't ask , i won't serve you the water.\" I am like excuse me, ... wtf, and she was like cause we are not serving like before, now if you didn't ask, no water will serve for you. okay, i don't want water if you don't want to give me just a little glass of water. today i had try a mango dessert, but they serve the bad mango sauce, it taste super disgusting, and taste like put it there for a month. super bad day, and the waitress came and said, oh the mango sauce is bad, but it won't make you vomiting and stomachache. wtf, and never say a sorry. and i ask for if we can get discount, cause me and my friend just have a little bit and hate of their attitude, and the waitress was like, oh you know which one of our boss?? so you for discount, excuse lady, we just had bad attitude and bad food, and no sorry and pay the same amount of money for those overdue food. Please, what a bad day i had."}
{"text":"Sugar Marmalade was a nice place and it is a fun place to go with your friends or family to chat and catch up. I only tried their dessert but they do serve food as well. I tried one of their parfaits and in my opinion, it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I also thought that their prices were too high. There was also a line up and you might have to wait a long time. Service also took long. Nice place but not the best in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. They only know mandarin so it was a little hard for us to order. Steam egg white with milk and ginger was good - strong ginger taste. Condensed milk black grass jelly and black glutinous rice with sago mix were okay - nothing too special."}
{"text":"The black glutinous rice with durian and coconut milk was very yummy! If you are a durian fan, you gotta try this. Tried a few other desserts, they are all ok nothing special. However, this place opens late and they deliver. Will order from here again."}
{"text":"Food was DISGUSTING but desserts were alright nothing wow their drinks too! Don't be fooled by the pictures what looks good doesn't actually taste good!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why, but all locations with this name has not good reviews...But yet this place is still quite busy! I initially came here with my bro and friend is b/c I was interested in having some 'popping boba'! Little did I know, they only had one flavour, but I had different flavour with my drink elsewhere. Anyways, seeing as this is a dessert place, their menu is quite extensive, and for wanderers that do not know what they like, you can sit and google at the menu for a while. But luckily they have a call button when you need them...  I ordered their durian with black glutinous rice on coconut milk and added some popping yogurt boba...It was alright, but the yogurt boba was sour, so it didn't mix well with sweet. I also got their mango mix with sago and yogurt boba, and it was alright.  All in all this place is aight, I'd give some other dessert a try, but their service is very lacksy daisy..."}
{"text":"This place is pretty small and ALWAYS busy. With no area for people waiting for a table.. BUT worth the wait.   Grilled calamari - just squid and salt. very simple but tasty $6.50  Japanese chicken - was soooooooo good. Lightly battered popcorn chicken topped with teriyaki and garlic sauce ..shredded dried seaweed on top $8  Mango shaved ice -AMAZING ...its simply shaved mango ice cream with evaporated milk and mango chunks for $6.50  Mango golden drink- can't remember everything in it.. but not memorable.. wouldn't recommend $5.50   Watermelon/ mango drink - mango and watermelon fresh juice mixed .. I wouldn't order this again lol but it was a bad judgement call on myself.. I didn't like the mix of these juices but the juice was definitely fresh $5  We both left here full. For dinner and dessert under 50$ with tip included! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I used to be a super big fan of eating desserts and sweeteners, but Now I choose to eat less and to eat smart, haha!!!!    After reviewing and seeing all various photos and comments about this place, I finally had a chance to come and try its desserts this week. When stepping into the restaurant, My friend and I could recognize a strong and favourite smell - aroma of durian, so we both decided to place 2 orders of its so-called famous \"Black Glutinous Rice and Durian with Coconut Milk\". Needless to say, this is a good combination plate as a dessert.... so yummy!!!   Will recommend this place to all my friends and others and will come back again..."}
{"text":"We ordered the Golden Mango Black Pearl and the Golden Treasures Mixed and both were very tasty. The mango was fresh and flavourful and overall not too sweet. Good portions too. Service was prompt but the place was not busy. It was our first time there and won't be the last."}
{"text":"We had to serve ourselves cutlery water and repeat orders to the waitress. She was too busy tending to her friends. We would never go again. My husband likes the shaved ice we've had better and with more fruit. If you're looking for quality shaved ice there are many others than this chain. Popcorn chicken was too salty and beef noodle soup was underwhelming"}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow, however I really enjoyed the food served here. I always order their kimchi fries and their popcorn chicken. I love coming here with my friends and family, but most of the time I just order for pick up."}
{"text":"Came on a Sat night, service was pretty quick and good. If you're a fan of Taiwanese/Hong Kong deserts I think this is an amazing option to have in Mississauga!  Tried the Mango drink with jelly, was good."}
{"text":"Giving this place 2 stars strictly because of the variety of menu items they offer.   Anyway, I've been here twice with my friends, the first time I only had bubble tea and it wasn't bad but it was nothing special either. I did like that this place had free wi-fi and was easily accessible from where I used to live, so I came a second time.  The second time I ordered coconut shaved ice and it was disgustingly sweet. Presentation was not pleasing to the eye; it literally looked like a puddle of condensed milk. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Ordered the popcorn chicken (Taiwanese style) - it was alright, but some pieces were too big to be considered popcorn chicken (isn't finger-friendly). The quantity of sauce to popcorn chicken is not correct - waaaay too little sauce. I had pieces of cartilage in 3-4 pieces of chicken. If KFC can get popcorn chicken right, it shouldn't be too much to ask from Sugar Marmalade.   The service here is pathetic as well. We waited for 20 minutes after we got our popcorn chicken for the drinks to come out (bubble tea). This should've come out all at the same time.  The girlfriend ordered a taro milk (it's under the bubble tea section) - it's literally taro flavouring powder and milk. I noticed a very chalky texture to it. It took them 30 minutes to put milk and powder together in a cold glass. Kind of repulsive in my opinion.   I ordered the strawberry banana shake with aiyo jelly. The milkshake came in a glass jar, not the long glass flute on the picture. The milkshake was pretty fresh tasting, but the jello tasted like that memory foam gel in mattresses. Honestly it was pretty disappointing - especially considering it took them 30 minutes to make this. I'm pretty sure you can do it in a magic bullet in like 5 seconds. Unbelievable.     Extremely disappointing. I came back here hoping they'd redeem themselves for my previous poor experience, but looks like nothing's changed for the better. Should've gone somewhere else.   Also they never refilled our waters."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they do not understand about fixing their own mistakes. Undercooked fish cakes and all they did was take it back and treated as if nothing happened.  I expect some type of accountability for above average cost.  In conclusion I did not get my food back and charged me. I recommend anyone to be prepared before entering this over rated place. The reviews below speaks for itself. I wish them the best to improve. P. S. Hot sauce costs 50 cents.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Hesitant in trying this place but one of my friends recommended it so decided to give it a try. Huge durian smell walking in but kind of got use to is after a while. Lots of things on their menu with entrees to desserts to bubble tea to hot drinks.   Their bingsoo came out really grand and pretty. Definitely sharable between a couple of people so you can order more food.   Overall the food was good but not something i would keep coming back to (theyre opened late so maybe late night snack)."}
{"text":"Served me frozen cheesecake, which was rock hard. After the fact that i waited 30 mins for my original  dessert that was sold out but they didn't bother telling me. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My first and also last visit to this place. Servers are slow in responding, no greeting, no smile. I ordered the stewed pear sweet soup, it says on the menu that it takes 15 mins to cook so I expected it to be hot and fresh, however, the pear was still frozen cold inside, I told the waitress, she just took it away and re-heated it for me, without any apologies or explanation. My friends ordered the Chinese pudding platter, which has dates in it, and it was sour... After we told the waitress such, she just said \"we've served a few orders tonight and there is no complaints\". Well, I have no idea why this place is so busy but I will definitely not gonna come again and will share my experience with friends too."}
{"text":"Desserts OK 4 stars Cooked food is 2 stars  Waited for a long time with no warning or update. Including us, there were only 4 customers at the time.  Small bowl of beef brisket noodle soup for $8.5, smallest I've ever had, poor value. Said to be Special but really nothing special about it.   4 wings for $7.5!! Wings were split into 8 pieces to create illusion that there are more than 4 pieces. Quality was OK, nothing special.   Won't come here for cooked food again."}
{"text":"The service is terrible and the food is questionable. I've been here several times and have yet to have a good experience. I only keep coming back because the desserts are unique.  The servers are unattentive and sometimes don't come even if you push the bell on your desk. Each time I've gone in, I've had to ask for water multiple times before receiving it, even during quiet hours.  I was in today and what I saw may have convinced me to never order food from here ever again. I sat closer to the kitchen and saw the workers in the back putting some food into a microwave. To my surprise, it came out and it was my boyfriend's \"Pepper Salt Baked Chicken\" and our Taiwanese popcorn chicken. The \"baked\" chicken was unsurprisingly mushy, tasteless and just downright terrible. The popcorn chicken was soft but tasted okay, I wouldn't recommend them or have them again knowing they're microwaved. Upon further inspection, they had 2 more microwaves just sitting right next to the washroom. Either for back up or because they use the microwaves so often that they go through so many. Who knows?  TL;DR: AVOID the food unless you want to spend your money on microwaved food. There are better places to go for the same type of dishes. Desserts aren't bad and I may come back for them until there's a better place to go to for Taiwanese style desserts in Mississauga."}
{"text":"If you're ever craving Taiwanese desserts, this is the place to go. With a range from fruit sago, coconut milk base fruit salads, mango parfaits, popcorn chicken, bubble tea, and much more, its menu is extensive and ridiculously cheap. Each fruit plate, drink, and parfait, ranges from $5-7. It's meal course are more around $7-10 which is the usual for bubble tea meal prices.   We ordered one fruit bowl w/milk & ice cream and another with coconut milk which is vegan friendly. I'm not a fan of ice cream but their fruits and milk/sago/filling are always a good combination. They really know how to pair things together.  It's great to catch up and chill with friends here and with the amazingly cheap prices, you'll be sure to do it on a budget too!"}
{"text":"The service was a mess, the servers do not know the name of the food that they were serving. My friend ordered a chicken rice but the waitress brought a ribs rice to our table and told us their chicken rice is out of stock so the ribs rice is the replacement without asking if my friend wants it or not.   Overall, their food was okay but not impressive and the servers definitely need more training."}
{"text":"Whoever decided to allow durian to be served and stink up the whole place needs a big ol slap.   Desserts were alright. I'd recommend the Oreo Milk Tea if anything. Sadly it stank like nasty ass durian the whole time. Plz fix."}
{"text":"I've been to both the location at Dragon City and the one here in 'sauga, and I have to say, this is my new favourite location to hang out with friends. The green tea shaved ice is my weekly craving, and their hot food ain't half bad either. Prices are good for the portions, and I never leave feeling overwhelmed."}
{"text":"This place is new to Mississauga so we gave it a try. We tried to order the sesame soup but they said they were out. It was 1pm in the afternoon, how can they be out? We ordered the  red bean soup instead and mango pancake. I don't think the pancake was fresh and the mango looked like it came out of a can. It took 20 minutes to get just one item. The red bean soup was lukewarm and part cold. It was reheat in the microwave (this is straight from the waitress). Don't think we'll come here again."}
{"text":"Got diarrhea here.  Serves me right for ordering their durian drink.  BTW the durian drink description list ice cream as part of the drink but when it was served I was told I have to order the ice cream as an add on.  Don't try to prove me wrong though."}
{"text":"Seen this before when stopping by Canada Computers and finally decided to go with some friends. Good atmosphere with adequate food choices. I got the Japanese popcorn chicken for my order. while it tasted great at first, it slowly become something else as it felt over drench with sauce and this may became a sour taste after?  One of my friend also ordered this dish and noticed a lot of pieces were just chicken fat deep fried. The other orders were the green tea parfait and they definitely got that right,  the taste was great. The only other thing to avoid is their water they serve you in the beginning, taste like tap water with added lemon juice for flavour, best avoid.   Only minus a star because of the negatives I mention but besides that it's great place for desserts and drinks."}
{"text":"Ordered a matcha panna cotta, pancakes with mango and ice cream, and the Taiwanese style crispy chicken. I loved the dessert that were ordered, but I will probably skip the crispy chicken next time. Both the desserts weren't overly sweet, and the panna cotta were so smooth and creamy.  The chicken didn't have enough flavor i find. Parking was always an issue at first Markham place. We were a party of eight, so the wait was about half an hour. I'd definitely return and try other foods and desserts!"}
{"text":"I spotted Sugar Marmalade on Yelp and suggested it for dessert place after dinner.  The 2 local Toronto couples with us got very excited when they checked out the menu!  Like kids in a candy store.  Popular spot on a Friday night, especially for the younger crowd.  We just increased the average age that evening .  Luckily our wait was not too long.  We each ordered different desserts.  They were big & could have easily shared (to save calories).  My favorite was the mango with black grass jelly & the green tea shave ice with red beans.  There's other snack food that's not desserts."}
{"text":"Amazing place , reminds me of a bbtea chilling spot in Montréal  We tried the shaved ice mango and other desserts , so good OMG , love it  They let you pour the milk on your own  They also offered Taiwanese dishes and bbtea  Amazing environment  Must go back  Perfect date place to stop by"}
{"text":"Came to sugar marmalade on a Friday night and it was quite busy and had to wait about 20 mins for a seat. I ordered the coconut sago with mango and I feel like the portion was slightly larger than most dessert places and had the same average price. My order came quite quickly and the staff are on top of the customers to ensure we eat and leave as there is usually a line for seats. I would definitely come back here but if there is a wait I might just get take out."}
{"text":"Desserts were mediocre, and the portion sizes for takeout were very small - not really worth the money.  What makes this place awful is their horrendous customer service.  I visited on a Saturday evening, which was busy but not packed.  It took almost 40 minutes for our food to come, meanwhile patrons that were seated after our order started getting their food.  When our food finally arrived, they forgot an item and we had to wait 20 minutes longer.  When we asked the girl at cash what was going on she didn't seem like she cared and told us \"we just had to wait\", even though they forgot one of our orders.  When our food finally came out, she muttered a half-hearted apology.  The staff seems disorganized and inexperienced.  I would expect a restaurant to be able to accommodate high volumes of guests on a Saturday evening.  If my food is going to take long, I wouldn't mind if they had given me a warning."}
{"text":"Been here twice. It's on par or maybe slightly better than the dessert/bubble tea/cafes in this area. Reasons being a bigger selection of items and seating area."}
{"text":"I love the beef balls and the calamari. I have to saw the beef ball sauce is amazing. Little spicy but not too overwhelming. My buddy and I would dip the calamari in the sauce."}
{"text":"Wasn't really sure what to rate this place...  The food is mostly preserved  The three cups chicken was a good meal for the price... I don't have anything to compare it to but i'd imagine it should be crispier... Was full of sauce so my guess is that it was not cooked long enough. See picture  The sausage maybe a little overpriced  The dessert (house special sago mixed with mango and watermelon juice) was very tasty  Some of the people behind the counter (I think they prepare stuff) do kind of ignore you, though the young waitress offered pleasant service  It seems like a place that students come to for cheap food and tasty drinks/deserts"}
{"text":"Decent spot. I've been here exactly 4 times and there hasnt been once where they were out of something and i had to order something else which is extremely annoying. Quality of the desert and food are good enough for what you pay for, everything is very reasonably priced. Overall, this isn't somewhere I crave to go when my sweet tooth kicks in but once in a while doesn't hurt."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in for dessert. They have a huge selection on their menu which can be both good and bad; good to try different things, bad if you didn't come in with recommendations because it can be a little overwhelming. Ambiance is not too bad. Service is so-so. They had a few staff that evening, but only one of them ever bothered to smile when serving. Or even bothered to be polite when we were trying to clarify our orders. (They automatically charged 10% tip on our bill, so I guess they feel they didn't really need to do a good job as we're expected to pay either way.)  I will only speak on my order because my friend's order had issues but they \"fixed it\" after she asked them to. I ordered the Dream Sundae which didn't arrive until after my friend already got her snack food and dessert.  When it did come: (1) it looked absolutely nothing like the picture in the menu. That's not a terrible thing, but when I asked them if the item was my order, I got a flat \"it's a sundae\", basically saying I ordered a sundae so I should accept the item because it meets the definition of a sundae. (2) it had strawberries instead of blueberries. I asked why there were strawberries because the menu said blueberries, to make sure I had the right order, but I think he took it as a personal criticism. The response I got was \"it's seasonal.\" Last I checked, September is not strawberry season... but it's not a a big deal if I ate strawberries instead of blueberries.  (3) however, it had cereal, which isn't even on their list of ingredients. I pointed it out and asked what it was, because I didn't see cereal in their ingredients list, and it didn't occur to me intially, that it was cereal. Maybe I asked too many questions, but I think he got upset... except if you're going to make up a somewhat different item than what I thought I ordered, how am I suppose to know if I don't ask?  The sundae was \"ok\" at best. It was too sweet, as it was loaded with chocolate sauce and sugary cereal, I felt a little overdosed on sugar after that. Overall experience was \"meh\", so I rate it 2. Location is good, ambiance is good, but there are similiar shops within a few minutes walk that I don't think it'd be worth my time to come back to try anything else, based on service and how they seem to have made up my sundae on the spot. (Although I'll assume that almost everything else would have been made exactly as it looked on the menu, and I just happen to picked the wrong thing.)"}
{"text":"After hearing all the great reviews and seeing so many photos on instagram, I finally had time to come try out this new dessert place at First Markham Place.  Overall, I would come again and try more dishes.    Food:  Great selection of snacks, drinks and desserts.  We tried the Hong Kong style rice roll, mango sago and stewed egg with milk/ginger.  Taste was good and portions are pretty generous.  The Hong Style rice roll could be improved if the pieces weren't chopped out so small so that you can chew and enjoy the texture more.  The mango sago was generous with the amount of mango pieces but overall flavour could be intensified.  The stewed egg with milk/ginger was the best dish I tried.  Very flavorful and perfect texture.    Service: Trendy and has a great vibe.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and comfortable.  Seating is roomy and I like how it has some booths."}
{"text":"Service was quick and courteous. Food was brought out quickly and piping hot so be careful. We ordered four hot dishes and one dessert. Everything tasted good. Would come again. Wasn't that busy when we got here on Friday Saturday night."}
{"text":"Initially the place was good the service was consistent even though the place was packed. I just went again and the wait staff was awful service is slow as there would just stand around and not alert to wait on the customers. The most frustrating is every time I order the pancake with mango and was told the item is out how can a dessert store out of mango pancake??? Very dissapointed."}
{"text":"Amazinggggg Asian desert place near Yonge and Sheppard!! I tried their Japanese popcorn chicken and it was absolutely delicious! From their hot crispy chicken to their drizzled teriyaki sauce and mayo to their slightly drifting bonito flakes and seaweed , they hit it right on the nail! So on point!! I have not tried the other popcorn chicken versions but I heard they're not as decked out. So give it a try!! :)   Plus, their sago mango dessert does not disappoint!!  ;)"}
{"text":"The customer service was horrible! Asked the lady what an item was and didn't give a clear explanation. We still had another question but she left. Called the male worker over and takes the paper and pen from the other side of the table and roughly puts it on top of the menu. He was about to walk away before we asked the question. It was my first time here and they were straight up rude. The desserts was alright, not the biggest fan. The desserts took  20-40 minutes to arrive after ordering. (Got the marshmallow toast with strawberries and a strawberry banana mille feuille)"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times and there's always more to try!  Here's what I've tried so far:  - black sesame parfait (3/5): The black sesame ice cream is very rich in flavour, but instead of using ice cream or yogurt in the middle, they used whip cream. Very weird.  - durian panna cotta (4/5): The black sesame ice cream doesn't go too well with the durian. The durian taste completely covers the black sesame taste.  - durian roll supreme (5/5): The coconut roll itself is very unique and interesting. The texture is actually like chinese \"cheung fun\" (rice roll). The combination is delicious.  - durian pancake (4/5): The pancake batter is perfect, but inside there's way too much whip cream for the amount of durian.  - durian mochi (2/5): The mochi itself is not chewy at all. Nothing like mochi.  - golden sago (5/5): Very tasty and rich in mango taste!  - sweet almond soup (1/5): Artificial almond taste - mango shaved ice (1/5): No mango taste in the shaved ice at all. Tastes like water.  - golden royal drink (5/5): Tastes like the golden sago, but has popping yogurt!  - hong kong style steamed rice rolls (3/5): Not hk style at all. No soya sauce and the rice rolls are very hard.  - taiwanese fish cakes (3/5): just like all the other fish cakes  - popcorn chicken on rice (4/5): Very crispy and not too salty!  - curry chicken on rice (5/5): The curry is delicious and the chicken crispy!  - salt baked chicken on rice (2/5): Chicken is over cooked, all falling apart and dry  Overall 4/5, not the best service, but the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I cannot fathom why this place does not have more 1 star and zero star reviews.   The most accurate review I read was categorized under the \"not helpful\"  section, but perfectly described our time at sugar marmalade.     This place has absolutely blown me away with the combination of things that can possibly be done wrong all together at once.   It's actually quite impressive.   First off everything is microwaved.   You can clearly watch the servers using the microwaves non stop through the little window at the food pick up.   There's two,  and they are the stars of this flavourless over cooked orchestra.   Yes,  they will even microwave your drinks,  as they clearly did with mine.   How did I know?   They served mine in a giant thick mug (much like a beer mug)  except my entire glass was hot.   - Even the handle -     I've poured boiling water to make many cups of tea in my life and never once has the HANDLE been hot,  even in the tiniest of espresso shots.     The food was obviously microwaved.   How does this over-the-top food critic know?   The curry pork was raisin dry,  the curry reduced to some sort of watery-salsa like substance.  Oh right,  and my whole table watched them put it in the microwave and blast it for 5min before putting the lid on their little black take-out container before  again it up for us.   Maybe the slightest chance I'm wrong,  but if so then they obviously attempted to cook my dish by leaving it in the sun that morning.   The one star is in case that is indeed the case and I salute the effort to prepare our dish.    The service is Sub par,  the desserts are bland and tasteless but the kicker is (and other reviews will corroborate this)  is when you leave,  you will smell like grease.---Your clothes and hair,  everything.   Very strange,  and it's that exact moment when you will have a flash back upon taking your first steps into sugar marmalade when the over whelming smell of grease hits your nostrils.  But you disregard it because,  \"I'm at a dessert house\".     That,  ladies and gentlemen is the true mystery.   How does a place that so obviously does not prepare it's food,  have such a thick aura of grease.      Ps:  this experience was so bad It actually inspired me to start this yelp account just to make sure that future yelpers get a truly fair spectrum of reviews before going to sugar marmalade.  Make no mistake,  it's on yonge street in North York.    Bon appetite"}
{"text":"Amazing shaved ice desserts!! I've only had the mango and green tea shaved ice and although I'm a huge fan of green tea, the mango tastes way better.   Already been here twice in 1 week since I found this place!"}
{"text":"I give 1 star solely for the horrible customer service. Now first the foods, they are meeeeh. But drinks are good! Especially the mango drink and I also like oreo milk tea.   Now the worst part. I came to this place twice. First time came already received such a bad treatment. Not from the waitress but from girl behind the cashier. My first time, the waitress was actually nice and accommodating but the cashier was rude. I thought ok she maybe had a bad day and I still gave a good tip since the waitress was nice enough to say the least. Then I came here second time, I thought I would just ordered for a take out not to encounter the bad service and ordered only two drinks. I waited more than half an hour and when I saw that my order was finally done I went to the cashier and this is when I had the rudest service I have ever had in Montreal, she basically told me in a very rude and demanding voice to step aside and waited next to the kitchen where the waitresses and staffs going back and forth. I said that my order was there and again in a rude manner, she said I was not the only one ordering those yet it was the only take out order at that time and so I waited behind the cashier instead where the high chairs are and there were only two people sat there and plenty of seats n I wasn't even sitting down and again in plain rude voice demanding me to wait next to the kitchen because those seats are for people eating inside (again I wasn't sitting and my order had arrived!!) and finally those orders were actually mine!!!   She treated me as if I came there to beg for foods without paying!!   You guys need to fix your staff's attitude! I wont be back and needless to say I do not recommend this place unless you are ready to get worst service."}
{"text":"It does take awhile for someone to notice you when you first enter Sugar Marmalade. They should consider moving the plants/signage away from the front door, so they can properly greet customers in a timely manner.    The place wasn't too busy on a Wednesday night, so our waitress was very friendly and attentive or perhaps she saw me whip out the Yelp app.   There's so much to choose from in their menu! Pages after pages, from desserts such as shaved ice and coconut sago, to hot appetizers such as popcorn chicken and beef brisket noodles.   I came for the dessert, so ordered myself Sweet almond and sesame soup ($4.99). The price is very fair considering the portion size - the bowl was probably two times the size of other Chinese dessert places I've been to. The almond paste was A-OK, but too sweet for my preferences. The sesame side was perfect, but why is this item freezing cold?! My mistake for not confirming.. but other places serve this item steaming hot.   My brother ordered watermelon sago (I noticed they like adding watermelon to many items in their menu). He said it was not bad, but the sago itself was pretty clumpy (see pic) as if it was previously frozen.   I'll be back to try out other items from their extensive menu! They're too conveniently located for me to stay away from.. I can never satisfy that sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"Two of us went in on a Saturday night around 8pm. We were seated promptly because there were only 2 of us however it took 30 minutes of waiting for someone to come collect our order that we had ready. Noticing that people who came after us were being served, we got up and got the attention of a waitress to finally place our order. Then, our orders came 20 minutes after that and came staggered to the table. We received one dish at a time with 10 mins between. We decided to share the dishes so we didn't have to wait for all the dishes to arrive. When they came to our table the waitresses did not say one word nor smile. They did not check in on us. Even when I went to pay they did not say one word.   We had a feeling that we were receiving bad service because neither of us were Asian (we were the only non Asians there). After reading comments written by other non-Asians, I am speculating that the workers discriminate against non Asian customers.  While we enjoyed the food, the service was beyond disappointing and upsetting that I simply cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with dessert! Sugar Marmalade has plenty of diverse menu options that cater to the tastes of all! My personal favourites are the mango and coconut base dessert soups. The only con is that there's an abundance of topping and not that much soup. Soup also tastes a bit watery at the bottom but I think they were just having that one off day.   The service here is not that great, and it's often really busy so not the best calm and quiet place for some talks and hang out times with friends."}
{"text":"Came around 6pm on Saturday, pretty good service and food quality during the busy time. Would definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"None of the dessert we ordered was good. And the service was poor as well. This is a place I will probably never get back to."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times - usually with a group of about 6 people. It seems to be a hit or miss. There are so many options on the menu but there are only a few \"gems\" or item that are actually worth getting.   I highly recommened the Japanese Popcorn Chicken. It has Japanese mayo, teriyaki sauce, seaweed, and bonito flakes on top of deep friend popcorn chicken. I get this every time. It is a bit salty for my liking, but it never disappoints. (P.S. - I had a friend order the kimchi fries.. don't bother. You're just getting spicy mayo with tiny kimchi bits on top of your fries).   I also liked the green tea parfait - they use good green tea ice cream. Their mango pancake is also delicious. It's essentially a crepe with whipped cream and mangoes inside and vanilla ice cream on top. It has a TON of whipped cream. It may look huge but since it's mostly whipped cream it's not that heavy.  If you ask for a glass of water, you'll get lemon water. This can either be great or horrible. If you're lucky, you'll get a fresh batch. If you unlucky, you're gonna get water that had a old lemons sitting in it all day.   Service is best on weekdays. Parking in that plaza is quite annoying cause it's a bit small and there are lots of businesses there."}
{"text":"Boy oh boy was this place noisy. Not really a good hangout place for that reason. Still a good place to get a variety of good dessert and snacks, though. Although I did not feel relaxed at this location, I would still see myself coming back often."}
{"text":"Like a lot of \"dessert\" restaurants, the choices are plentiful, the service is (usually) prompt and the food is almost always good, if nothing else.  Sugar Marmalade is a bit of a \"hole-in-the-wall\" business, nestled in between a bunch of other businesses including an office supply store. Like a lot of other places in this strip mall (including Planet Hobby and Red Lobster, both of which I've reviewed on Yelp), I had no idea it even existed until a friend suggested we visit.  Our first choice of venue (Chatime Bubble Tea) had a line stretching out the door, so we walked down to Marmalade and were able to quickly get a table for five. I've read some Yelp reviews that mentioned that they were ignored because they weren't Asian, but we didn't have any of those problems. Any wait times for items were communicated in advance, and the order system was easy to figure out.  This place reminded me a lot of the restaurants on the Queen St. strip in Toronto, where you can step in and find a place that may not have much seating, but more than makes up for it with style and food.  We started out with the Popcorn Chicken, a dish where you can taste the MSG in every bite. I'm assuming that's because of the mayo (Kewpie?), but the flavor really set it off.  I went for a banana milkshake ($6) and found it quite good. Nothing over the top, and they serve it with whipped cream and a spoon, but I really enjoyed it. I was initially going to go for the pudding platter, but had to switch to the strawberry-and-banana Mille Feuille ($10) after seeing a poster on the wall for it. Having once seen a raspberry variant of this dish made in a Gordon Ramsey video, I knew I needed to finally try this dish.  It's really nice and light - layers of pastry interspersed with sliced berries and bananas along with whipped cream. There was also a scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce on the side. Essentially, it's an ersatz banana split. I was impressed by how light the dessert was, though if I have a suggestion for the staff, they need to serve it with a sharper knife. The cutlery they provide to eat a dish like this is way too dull, especially if you're trying to cut it with a knife.  I can see why Sugar Marmalade is so popular, and I found the food and overall experience to be enjoyable. This spot has moved to a destination I need to get back to as soon as I'm able to. Recommended."}
{"text":"Went there at midnight and it was packed so we took ours as a game or instead. We got the papaya steam milk and the sago with pomelo and mango, with a a mint and mandarin soda. The soda took awhile to get so we waited at the door for 20mins to get everything. The place take CASH only, they do have a atm at the door.  The food was great tasted really good. Not too over sweet it took us 15mins to drive home but the papaya was still very hot inside. Everything was decent except for the customer service. They didn't tell us anything, they didn't say thank you when I paid nothing. The service was horrible, I get it it's late and you rather be home but it doesn't mean you can treat customers that way. My meal was $22.00 for three items, I will go back but it depends how tolerable I am with rude staff."}
{"text":"This place was great despite the negative reviews. I've had the durian sago and mango dessert which was so tangy and sweet. It was super delicious and great to come after dinner. The service was a bit slow when we came but what can you expect when they're clearly understaffed.  I do think that this is a great place for a date or to come with a few friends once in a while. Their menu is pretty good but I guess you have to becareful on what you order based on other reviews I have read."}
{"text":"This Chinese dessert place has some of the most creative varieties of dessert.  You can get the old school classics, but they also put a nice twist on things.  I got the 'Infinite cloud' dessert, which is black and white mix of lychee balls, grass jelly, coconut milk, and pearls topped with a scoop of coconut ice cream.  Also on the table was a mango sago dessert with mango juice and topped with citrusy pomelo.    Sugar Marmalade manages to keep old classics looking fresh"}
{"text":"We got the green tea waffle and it was nothing special.  The pictures look a lot better than it taste.  Also got the mango sago and again nothing special. They ran out of ice cream so only had a choice of chocolate or sesame.  Wouldn't go back for dessert."}
{"text":"With everyone and their best friends flooding social media with pictures of their visits to Sugar Marmalade, I caved as usual and hopped on the trend train. First impressions: cute decorations, busy as heck. We went on a week day afternoon around 3PM or so, and the place was full to the brim. Somehow we managed to grab the last available table.   I heard a lot about the service; apparently, many people have had terrible experiences, but, fortunately, this wasn't the case for us. The food came at a decent speed considering how full the place was, and the server was polite and helpful.    Flipping through the menu, which was heavy and complicated, we tried to order four things and were told two of them were sold out. We were disappointed but not surprised, and finally we ended up getting the mango shaved ice bowl, popcorn chicken, and a green tea parfait. All three were great, but the mango shaved ice really stood out; not only did it have the best price (for the quantity), but the texture of the ice and strong flavours were the perfect afternoon treat! I'll definitely be coming back to try the green tea shaved ice, but I'll wait a bit until the hype has died down."}
{"text":"While my friends thought that the entrees were good, anyone who has had authentic Taiwanese food before would be a bit disappointed. The desserts on the other hand were quite good. I liked anything with their coconut soup, such as their glutinous rice balls. Most of their desserts are fruit-based, which gave a fresh, not-too-sweet taste to it.   The service was terrible. Perhaps it was because we were at a table that was hidden away behind a wall which made it hard for servers to see, but getting attention from waiters was hard and it seemed that they found it hard to understand our requests at some times.   However, prices were reasonable and the food was quite good. I'd recommend it as a chill place to hang out with friends and get some good desserts, but if you're looking to satisfy and try some authentic Taiwanese cuisine, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"I decided to come here on a Saturday night with my family, and ended up having to wait 20 minutes before we got a seat (not that it was a big issue, but seating is quite limited especially during peak hours, so be prepared for a wait). I ordered the mango sago (something along those lines), and it was decent. The mangoes were slightly hard and sour, but I guess it isn't quite mango season here, so it wasn't a big deal. Proportions were of decent size, along with the price. Parking was definitely an issue, as the location is quite centralized."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service ever! I was left standing for 30min when the people after us were seated just cause they were rude and loud. Unbelievable! After we finally seated I was served the wrong dessert and not even given any water.... When I finished my dessert in the quickest manner just to leave the horrible atmosphere, the waitress didn't even hand me my change and left it on the counter when I was less than a meter away. Don't know why I even bothered try this place...."}
{"text":"Was excited to hear that Mississauga was finally getting a dessert place. Was very disappointed with the service and lack of ingredients with the desserts. I find that the desserts are pretty much just filled with mango syrup, everything was lacking, i.e. mango fruits, tapioca, sago etc, etc... Not to mention, when we ordered chicken wings, we were suppose to get 6 pcs of wings..but instead of getting 6 wings, they cut the wings in half to make it appear to be 6 wings, but in fact if you put the halves together, we only got 3 wings...   Very disappointed, good thing it's right beside Chatime because I would skip this place."}
{"text":"The food was decent and service was extremely slow, also it is very small in there. It was also very confusing to find because they have one on sheppard but it turned out to be an office which was very misleading"}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday afternoon which was not busy. We were greeted and seated right away. I ordered bubble tea shave ice and my husband ordered green tea red bean shave ice. They are both delicious and huge portion. I would definitely recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"This is my first time here, heard about it from a friend and was really looking forward to trying it!  The food was really good! But the service...not so much.. Still gave it a 4 star cuz the food is worth it.   I came on a Monday night (labour day) around 8:30 with myself, sister, brother and fiancée. It wasn't that busy yet so we got seated right away. We got a booth at the corner by the entrance, felt a little bit \"excluded\" and hidden. Our server was quick to give us the menu and glasses of water. It was a good start....then went a little downhill from there.   There are tons and tons of options, we couldn't decide! We all originally wanted to try their bubble tea but got sucked into getting something else! Since it was our first time, we weren't sure how things worked nor did the server explain or even bother asking if we've been there before. We didn't realize that you had to write down your order on the piece of paper that was left on the table...then we weren't sure if we had to bring it up to the front....waitress never came back or even looked at us to see if we were ready. Each table has a \"call button\"...we pressed it, nothing happened....we tried again....nothing....tried a third time (3rd time's the charm right?)...nope! We began waiving and finally someone at the bar noticed and alerted our waitress, finally! She came, took our piece of paper and food arrived within 10 minutes! Someone else brought our food and she says \"not sure if your server mentioned but your call button is broken\" .....welllll thanks for letting us know...I guess. We ended up using the call button at the table next to us! The other servers seemed to be pretty good from observing them. Who knows, maybe ours is new?  Hopefully in the future service will be better! But the food was sooooo good! We were all happy with our orders!"}
{"text":"Typical Asian place for fried snacks, Asian desserts from A-Z, and carby meals. This is the place I usually go when friends want to meet for tea. It's not my first pick and I only come here because it is within SECONDS of where I live. It also is a place my friends seem to like.  Seating is cramped and small. Service again is to be expected: They seat you, take your orders, and clear away dishes.  Always busy and packed. Cheap."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried chicken on rice and a sesame parfait. I think both orders have decent taste, presentation and portion but I can definitely find something similar but better with the same price. For that I would give 3 star. However, I need to ask for my parfait for three times and by the time I got it, all of my friends had already finished their food. Therefore I would deduct 1 star from 3.  Food: 3/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 2.5/5 Overall: 2.5/5"}
{"text":"Been here many times. This time tried the durian Mille. The different texture of the ice cream, whipped cream, durian paste mixed with the pastry creates a good contrast."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my go-to dessert places, especially when I'm craving something not too sweet.   They have an extensive selection of Asian desserts such as sago, black pearl or black glutinous rice and they're all delicious. My favourite is the taro with sago mixed with an add-on of pearl delight (YUM!). I have had some of their drinks before and overall they've just been alright for me. The frostbite taro drink I'd probably avoid (it was very icey and didn't have much flavour to it). I'd get the Italian soda (strawberry & lime) again because it tastes good AND it's served in a mason jar .   I've only had some appetizers from there (popcorn chicken, fried lobsters balls and fried fish cakes). If you're into the typical Asian salty fried food like I am, you'll be a fan.   It's not too big in there and it does get quite busy during Friday and weekend nights. They don't accept debit (ATM is available, but why bother), so make sure to either have cash with you or a credit card.   Till next time, Sugar Marmalade."}
{"text":"2.5  I was really craving for some popcorn chicken and at 12am, the only place I could find was here. They have two locations (I believe, other one at Midland and Finch). We ordered the regular popcorn chicken and the Japanese style popcorn chicken. Their popcorn chicken did not have the regular spice that other place uses so I thought that was a little off because I was craving that taste and also their Japanese one was SO SALTY. They literally doused the chicken with sauce.. I mean sauce is good but a little goes a long way. I felt like my tongue was being assaulted.  I have yet to try their desserts but until then, I will not come back for popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"I arrived late to this venue.. My group of friends (4 of them) were already seated in a booth... So I was quite bewildered to find that there was no room left for me. I looked around the restaurant to see if there were any bigger tables but to my disappointment, there weren't.  Let me pose one important question to you: why else would one go to a dessert place if not with a large group?? How would you optimize your experience if not by being able to order the whole menu with your many friends? This place doesn't have tables for more than 4 ppl! What kind of business strategy is that?! Considering your target market is Chinese people, you should know that such clientele travel in large clans. I was not pleased. Nonetheless, I pulled a chair and sat at the head of the table.  Now, onto the food... We ordered: Taiwanese delight, mango delight, fried chicken, teriyaki frites and taro delight. Judging from these names, I would also suggest a better marketing strategy. The teriyaki fries were actually quite tasty! They were garnished with MOVING bonito flakes which could pose as a potential shock for those not familiar with japanese cuisine. The other items were mediocre at best... Nothing great to be mentioned there.  It should also be mentioned that not once during the two hours we were there were we offered any water or napkins. I am a very dehydrated and clumsy person by nature so both these factors were problematic for me. When we did retrieve the water, it tasted like a sketchy lemon flavoured blend.   All in all, it's not a bad choice for sauga but I'd just save myself the trouble and get a 3-coloured bean dessert at your local Pho joint."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for dessert and bubble tea.  Actually, I'm a sucker for food in general.   What you see is exactly what you get. Drinks are on point, food is fresh and flavourful, service has always been quick and attentive. We ordered the Durian slush? Smoothie? Idk. The drink only had a life span of 5 minutes, once we realized how freaking good it was.   I prefer their Taiwanese popcorn chicken over Bubble Republic and Stay Cafeteria.  The mango sago with grass jelly was good - and plenty of mango chunks. They have a ton of Taiwanese snacks, entrees and desserts available. Ample seating, compared to their Chinatown location but still a pretty tiny joint. Don't expect to be seated immediately if you're in a group. Even on at 4pm on a week day, it was packed.   We'll see how the standards hold up over time. Excited to see another popular joint coming into 'sauga. Definitely worth a try.   Notable mentions: - free parking (since it's not the Chinatown location..)  and you have pretty much the entire plaza - clean, and quick  - free wifi! - delivery service available - service buzzer at each table  - late hours; Sunday to Thursday 1am, Friday and Saturday 2am  - not tangible for large groups - cash & debit only"}
{"text":"For a late night craving, this is a good option. They have a lot of sweet options (hence the name sugar marmalade) but also a lot of savoury options.  The menu has a a variety of western and traditional dishes so there is something to appeal to everyone. They also have bubble tea options.   I had the mango pudding with fresh mango. Pretty sure it was boxed mango pudding over evaporated milk topped with mango. My brother got a fresh mango juice but maybe they meant fresh out of the carton because it was a thick mango nectar over ice.   Overall very blah. They only take cash/debit. A cool thing is their ordering system: you write your order on a paper and then press a button on your table to call the waiter/waitress to take the order."}
{"text":"Plenty of dessert choices all at a seasonable price! The desserts were pretty tasty, serving wasn't too slow. It gets busy at night, especially the parking lot. Anyways would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great place up in a place a rarely venture that I can only guess that it was near yonge and sheppard.   Sugar Marmalade speciilises in deserts and a variety of bubble tea type drinks.  Decent amount of seating and a clean and modern look this place can get busy at times so the staff tend to get overworked at times.  Did not try the food here and I am not actually sure whether they did food as we were there for the tea."}
{"text":"After finishing dinner at Ding Tai Fung, we went next door to Sugar Marmalade. Our kids were getting restless so we decided to order takeout instead of dinning in. I think the best attraction of this place is the laser sign. It kept our kids occupied while we waited for our takeout. I wish all restaurants should have one of these laser sign installed. Definitely a lifesaver for the parents with restless kids.  They did a great job with Golden Sago Mixed. Must try!"}
{"text":"The quality is so so.  The service is not great.  Our servers always looked like they were depressed and didn't really want to serve us.  They just moped around.  Just plopped down the menus and took off.  The food was not memorable at all.  I think we had the popcorn chicken and a couple of drinks.  The popcorn chick was cold and looked like it was just reheated in the microwave.  Honestly, nothing too good to talk about at all."}
{"text":"I downloaded Yelp just to write this review. 1) Awful service. We waited for 15 mins before anyone acknowledged us. You wont have a waitress \"assigned\" to your table because a different person talked to us every time (after we frantically waived them down) 2) We ordered the Mixed Assorted Sweet Dumplings and the Durian Roll Supreme. Both were just awful!! I threw up when I got home because the taste and smell of the durian was so disgusting. It didn't sit well with any of us. 3) We also ordered Taro milk green tea which was cold What a waste of my money!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 taro milk bubble teas and 1 oreo bubble tea from this place through UberEats. Deeply regret doing so. Firstly, my drink didn't taste remotely like taro, I even wondered if they got my order wrong. Secondly, all were wayyyyy too sweet. My drink tasted like rock sugar + water. I can handle sweet drinks, I drink sweet things on the regular. But this \"bubble tea\" tasted only of sugar. It looked milky but in actuality felt rough and powdery, kind of like drinking sand or maybe expired milk. Why did I pay to torture myself like this?  Overall, horrible experience. Definitely the worst bubble tea I have ever drank in my life. I had a hard time finishing it off and I'm pretty sure I shaved a couple months off my life by consuming that much sugar all at once. I'm not against trying their food or bowl type desserts, but for the sake of your tastebuds don't touch the bubble tea. Personally I need some time to recover from this traumatic experience."}
{"text":"Service is bad and food and deserts are bland. Most deserts do not look like the pictures in their menu. Got our order wrong twice and tried to argue over it to look like it was our fault. This place is cash only they and don't allow to pay with split bills."}
{"text":"I ordered the pannacotta, and there was barely any panna cotta in due to the shape of the cup. The red bean and lychee were waaaay too sweet and I couldn't taste the panna cotta at all.  My husband had the chocolate parfait, and it was very pricey for what it was. It was just generic chocolate ice cream, cornflakes, and some other bs ingredients."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are not wow. When I went there for some reason their water tasted very weird feels as if it was badly cleaned, also customer service is meh, they will not clear the empty finished dishes on your table  Wasn't satisfied overall."}
{"text":"A new Taiwan style desert joint at mavis and burnemthorpe; something not easily found in mississauga. It is basically a high end bubble tea place. They have basic food menu with finger foods such as fries and fried chicken. They have a large desert menu with many fascinating things on same. I tried the mango ice cream desert and a coffee almond drink. I stole some fries and chicken pieces from the group that were here today, and both are quite good. The fries are really tasty. I was here with some Asian friends of mine for a birthday desert get together. The interior is well done. Wifi is free with the phone number as the password. The only problem is the logistics need work;  items ordered get missed, they do not come at the same time, etc. It has potential, but needs work."}
{"text":"Deserts were ok but food was disappointing. We ordered the wings, and other appetizers that all tasted the same and wings looked really weird it didn't look like regular wings in shape and size. However we did ordered different deserts and most of them were good. Much better than the rest of the order for sure."}
{"text":"After coming back several times, everything went down the hill. The food is just bad now. The fried squid I used to love is now too salty and oily. The water tastes like dish soap. The service is bad and I don't know why they always give us a half empty glass of water. The desserts are still ok."}
{"text":"Came here around 11pm on a weekday.  Pros: - Decently priced items - Lots of seating - Open late  Cons: - Food tastes terrible (some of the worst food I've ever had). - CASH ONLY  DO NOT GET THE DURIAN PANNA COTTA it's absolutely disgusting"}
{"text":"The dessert was bad, extremely sweet and I personally eat a lot of sweet stuff. Just nothing really good about the desserts. It's cheap but for what they give it's still not worth the price."}
{"text":"Downgrading a star because service has been so bad during the last two visit. Gave one of our dishes to another table, ended up waiting 50mins for one of our dishes to arrive. We were clearly annoyed and our server stopped checking on us/avoided our table. They did give us 10% off + a dessert to go when we were leaving but altogether it just took long.  Disappointing because the desserts here are good."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this dessert place for a while now. My boyfriend and I went at 11 pm since it's one of the few dessert places open until late. I really like that they are open until 1am. Once we got inside we were seated immediately. It's a small place and it looks like it gets busy fast. We ordered the black sesame parfait which was a chef recommendation and I loved it! It comes with a scoop of black sesame ice cream and bits of frozen mango. This dessert was just the right amount of sweet! We also got the green tea waffle. I didn't like it as much because it came with red beans which was misleading. The menu did not include the toppings for the waffle. The pricing for the dessert is affordable. There are several other locations in which the menu includes food which I wouldn't mind trying next time. Overall the dessert and service was pretty good."}
{"text":"A go to spot with my friends. We always order their Japanese popcorn chicken and rice rolls along with the usual Asian desserts. It's a small place to get adjusted to. Food tastes great :) It's best to come here for a snack or dessert after meals."}
{"text":"Dessert was mediocre but service was outright awful. Just waiting to pay the bill the server walked by me holding the bill a good 5 times at least."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this place and the first time I got desserts. This time I got appetizer foods and bubble tea with my friend. We got popcorn chicken and calamari and the portions were a bit on the smaller side. I got taro bubble tea and my friend got Oreo coffee milk tea? Was kind of disappointed with my drink because I usually get taro milk tea at other places but at this place the drink just tasted like milk and could not taste the taro part. I got the cold drink instead of the hot one but the drink wasn't cold. However I liked the Oreo milk tea because it was different yet still good and not something I've tried at other bubble tea/dessert places. This is overall a decent place with a lot of food choices, and I would probably come back for their dessert selection!"}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --  I was around First Markham Place and noticed there was a new Sugar Marmalade. I didn't have a good impression of the Sugar Marmalade brand. I felt like their desserts were overpriced and their dishes/desserts were mediocre. However, I noticed they were having a promotion of 30% off the entire bill if you check in on Facebook or #sugarmarmalade on Instagram. I thought it was a great time to give it a try. I remembered the previous cafe at this location used to smell like a sewage plant. I was surprised Sugar Marmalade had fixed that issue. The interior design was similar to other locations.   -- Food and Drink --  Hubby wasn't very hungry that day and we decided to order one entree and 2 desserts to share.   1. Oyster Sauce Marinated Chicken Wing and Potatos on Rice - I loved the texture of their rice, it was on the dry side. The chicken wings were tasty and tender and were marinated very well! I wasn't a fan of their hard-boiled egg. The star of the dish was probably the cabbage. It was very flavorful and crunchy. :)   2. Fresh Watermelon with Black Grass Jelly (we paid extra to add Mochi in the dish) - This cold sweet soup tasted very coconuty and the soup base was very sweet. The mochi was very soft and chewy. I love the grass jelly and watermelon combo. Their watermelon tasted mild because the coconut soup overpowered the taste.    3. Green Tea and Red Bean Taiwanese Shaved Ice - I love how their Taiwanese Shaved Ice was very soft and silky. The shaved ice had a stronger matcha flavor than the icecream. Their red bean and mochi were so soft and chewy! The condensed milk made the dessert sweeter and went well with the red bean. I was quite shock their mochi weren't frozen (when I went to Tsujiri for their icecream, their mochi were frozen and I thought that was because they layered the mochi between the icecream).  -- Overall --  I have tried 3 Sugar Marmalade locations so far (North York, Mississauga and Markham) and for now the Markham one is the best. Of course, the food here is the best out of all three Sugar Marmalade. Our server, Stephanie, went out of her way to help us. My husband remembered trying a watermelon grass jelly and mochi dessert at another Sugar Marmalade but we weren't able to locate it on the menu. Stephanie showed us two dishes most similar as per his description. She went to the kitchen and asked if there was actually that dish. She visited our table frequently to make sure we enjoyed our meal. By the time we requested for our bill, she reminded us there's a 30% off promotion going on. I was very happy with the service and would definitely revisit this Sugar Marmalade again!"}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --  My friend and I had dinner around Yonge and Finch and decided to walk around and see if there's any dessert place. The place wasn't too over crowded but I don't like how it was way too dark (their walls and furniture are all in black). We did not have to wait and we got assigned to a table right away.  -- Food and Drink --  I ordered a 1. black sesame parfait and my friend ordered a 2. Green Tea Panna Cotta.   1. Black Sesame Parfait:  They layered some corn flakes in the bottom of the parfait cup (1/3 of the cup), layered some yogurt on top mixed with mango jam (1/3 of the cup), fresh mangos cubes layered on top (1/4) and lastly top off with a scoop of black sesame ice-cream plus two strawberry cream pocky.   I was quite disappointed with the parfait. You can tell they just used the ice-cream you could get in any Chinese grocery store. The mango cubes were so sour they should have just switched it to another seasonal fruit. My friend and I both think we could just make this at home instead of spending $6 here for a parfait. The corn flakes at the bottom turns very soggy and the texture was so bad to taste. The strawberry pocky just simply didn't go well with the parfait at all.   2. Green Tea Panna Cotta  My friend said it was the most mediocre dessert she has ever tasted. Again, they add corn flakes in the dessert but it just didn't match the texture at all.   -- Overall --  We were there for only 30 minutes and we were rushed to pay our bill and leave. I think most people understand people goto dessert house for dessert and chat. Servers weren't helpful. I cannot find a reason to go back given the dessert was mediocre and service and decor wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"Totally a rip off! $12 for Popcorn chicken and rice that is portioned way too small. The popcorn chicken itself isn't crispy and felt kinda soggy, that including a miserable portion of rice and a small egg that tasted kinda bad.   The royal mango drink for $7 is freaking small too, seriously I rather go next door to Coco and get a large bubble tea for the same amount.   Seriously there are better places around there that are better like Go for Tea or Tealicious."}
{"text":"Most disgusting place I've ever been. I understand people expecting tips. But you don't just take the money and didn't even bother bring back my change. And the waitress just ignore you after when I call her to bring my change.  That's disgusting. I don't think it even deserve one star"}
{"text":"Sometimes having lots of choices is a good thing. However, when the choices span over 14 pages, it gets quite stressful for those of the indecisive variety.   Decided to check out Sugar Marmalade with a friend one evening. The decor inside was mostly simplistic, but the wall of dessert quotes were very cute and fun!  I knew that it was more of a fusion dessert place, but I was surprised to see how many different kinds of desserts they incorporated. Everything from more traditional Chinese desserts and western desserts, to completely unique fusion options as well. The choices were way to expansive for my personal liking though, as it ended up with me just flipping through the pages unable to make a choice. With that in mind, it is always nice to know that they have something you're feeling up for.  A pretty good place to check out depending what you want for dessert. I would probably suggest somewhere more catered to specific desserts if you want something more traditional though."}
{"text":"I usually visit this sugar marmalade location and the service is okay but today I went in with my boyfriend for desserts. There were only five tables including us so it wasn't busy. They told us to sit down at a table so we did. For a good 10 minutes, they didn't give us any menus, water or paid any attention to us. We basically had to get things ourselves while we watched other tables get served. We ordered two desserts and one main food dish. We got our desserts but we're waiting a good 20 mins for our food, which apparently was sold out and they didn't notify us until we told them we were still waiting. We then later added onto our order and got waffles, which was not punched in by our server so we were waiting another 20 mins for it and had to have someone else punch it in for us. All in all, the staff were not attentive and quite careless when providing service or lack of. I'm quite disappointed because I like coming here for my Taiwanese desserts."}
{"text":"My sisters and I came here to fulfill some late night sweet tooth cravings. The place is pretty tight, the seatings are way too close. We could hear everyone's conversations and of course they could hear ours.   I tried to order the steamed milk and papaya dessert and the house special chicken wings but both were sold out. I ended up getting a hot almond milk black tea which tasted very \"perfumey\" and my sister got a mango tofu dessert which we didn't like either because the tofu wasn't very solid. We also got popcorn chicken and the other chicken wings (the non crispy one), they were both a little too salty. My other sister ordered a durian shake and durian mochi. Both were really good. The condensed milk on toast was good too but that's an item that's impossible to make wrong.  I'd come here again just to be able to try the steamed milk and papaya dessert and I'll probably stick to a normal drink like lychee bubble tea or something."}
{"text":"Was quite busy when we went. Would like to come back and try something else on the menu. Had the mixed fruit/ original egg waffle and the matcha egg waffle. Was told it would take 20+ mins. Waited and thought it was only ok when we finally got it."}
{"text":"Went there last night, ordered two mango dessert as my friend and I love mangoes. It was just perfect not too sweet. Definitely would go back to try their kitchen food and of course more dessert. They do have lots of choices which I love."}
{"text":"The service can be slow when they're busy, but I've enjoyed the food, drinks and desserts whenever I've been. On my last visit I had the ground pork with rice dish (the name escapes me) and a lime and mandarin orange  Italian soda (kinda weird, I know). The pork was full of flavour and the rice was just right for me. The soda was very refreshing and not too sweet. A great combination!!"}
{"text":"Great dessert place in Mississauga, and very close to Chatime for all you BBT lovers!  Let me start off by tell you, i LOVE mango. Anything with mango is delicious...well almost anything..  I tried their mango pancake. It was phenomenal! Mango chuncks, with whip cream, vanila ice cream and a plain pancake. The pancake was different than i've had before in that it felt sort of rubbery and had that \"too good to be true\" look to it. But it doesn't matter! It tasted delicious.  I went around 2pm on a Saturday and it was very busy already. They have a big open floor in the middle where in my opinion they should consider putting an extra table or two to fit more customers. I did also find that it was odd seeing only one waitress literally running around collecting and serving peoples orders while the other young man was sitting in a booth for some time with his friends. Hope that's not how it always is...The waitress was so busy running around that she missed checking up on our table and we were left waiting almost 10 minutes to ask for the bill. We grew impatient and walked up to the cashier to pay the bill. the waitress then told us we can sit down and that she will bring it over. At least she apologized for the delay - i dont blame her much anyway considering she was running around a lot.  All in all, aside from the wacky service, the food is great. If you're feeling for some authentic desserts, check this place out. :)"}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese dessert places. Have a wide range of variety, everyone can find what they like on the menu. If you are a mango lover like me this is the place for you. They have every type of mango dessert with all sorts of options and additions.   I've had the mango shaved ice before and it's amazing. I've heard the other desserts like sago, tofu, grass jelly and glutinous rice is good too. Keep in mind that it's definitely better when mangos are in season, like in the summer time! This time I tried the green tea shaved ice with red bean. The shaved ice is really good, highly recommended not like the ones at other places where it is really shaved ice with toppings. Here the green tea shaved ice is like green tea sherbet shaved into thin slivers of ice sheets. I think just eating that is light and airy and full of green tea flavour. It's also a bit creamy and not watery like regular ice. I found that the red bean topping was way too sweet and I wasn't able to finish the red bean. Otherwise it's delicious, I'm not sure if there's another place in Toronto that serves this but I've had this in other countries.   The place is a bit cramped. Poorly ventilated, they had to open the door and I was real cold cause I had to sit by the door. The service not the best but I guess it was not what we were looking for for a dessert place. Otherwise I thought the quality was decent. I heard from my friends the hot food was quite tasty. The portions are a good deal for the price! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here on a not so busy day. My friend ordered popcorn chicken and it came first so we were like ok whatever. But then we just watched her eat ALL the popcorn chicken because we had no food. We waited forever and finally asked them about it and they were like \"oh it's this and this right\" and then it came out five minutes later. Anyways our popcorn chicken friend had to watch us slurp our yogurt balls and eat shaved ice while she was already finished her meat. But all in all not a bad place for dessert (a lot of people on some days)"}
{"text":"Fusion Chinese desserts. They also serve food and bubble tea. This is their new branch in Montreal, they have at least 5 restaurants in Ontario.  Came here on the 2nd day of their soft opening at 9PM. This place was super busy, had to wait 15 minutes to be seated at a table. Expect a line.  Food: ordered a platter of Chinese puddings, the golden royal drink (creamy mango juice with aloe, fresh mangoes and popping bubbles) and some Taiwanese style popcorn chicken. The food came fairly quickly, considering how busy the place was. The puddings were great, fresh and not too sweet. The drink was fresh too. The popcorn chicken was tasty, nicely seasoned and not too oily.   Service: It was pretty slow. Had to ask twice for my bill and they ended up bringing the wrong bill. Never bothered to refill water. The fact that the restaurant was busy and that they just opened, I won't complain too much.  Everything else: the decor was nice; ambience, loud.  Overall: Good food, service needs improvement."}
{"text":"A trendy chain that seems to have caught the attention of many online platforms for a variety of Taiwanese style desserts, which definitely sparked my interest in trying it. The menu has a large range of items, from salty items such as popcorn chicken and curries to crepes, shaved ice, smoothies, and much more. We had ordered a variety of items including shaved ice, crepes, bubble waffles, sago, and mille cake. Notably, I thought some of the better desserts were the sago and crepes. The mixed fruit crepe had a wide variety of fruit, and the crepe itself was light and fluffy. As well, the sago had a creamy texture and a variety of fresh fruit ingredients. As for the rest of the desserts, they were honestly substandard to standard. I wasn't inherently impressed, considering the price, and having gone to other dessert establishments that served the same desserts, the quality wasn't quite there. Overall, a decent establishment with a wide variety of desserts to choose from. However, if you're set on one kind of dessert, such as shaved ice, or sago, or bubble tea, there are far better and more specialized options at a better price range."}
{"text":"This two star review is for their inconsistent takeout.   Two nights this week, I've had some massive craving for glutinous rice with coconut milk and mango.   The first night I got it, it hit the spot.   The rice was soaked with a good amount of coconut milk and layered with large pieces of coconut.   Tonight, I ordered the exact same thing.   I open the lid and a gush of mango sago soup spills out.   Wtf?  There's no coconut milk and instead of coconut milk, it's more of a congee with mango soup.   I'm super annoyed at tonight's dessert.     Best to check your order before you leave next time you get take out."}
{"text":"The black glutinous rice with coconut milk and mango was pretty decent.   However the special golden mango drink was disgusting - it was semi warm and had a funny taste to it.   My husband got the Kimchi fries which was topped off with cold Kimchi you buy at the supermarket and odd smelling sriracha mayo and seaweed.   The service was slow and they forgot a couple of items that we had ordered.   However they were kind enough to take 10% off our bill due to their error.  Typically on a weekend evening, you will need to wait before you can get a spot.     If you're around the area and really want some Chinese dessert, then come.   But I wouldn't venture out of my way to have dessert here."}
{"text":"Food was good I got the choclate egg waffles. Came here on a weekday and the service was super slow took more than 30 minutes to get our food."}
{"text":"The service was too slow even it was not a rush time. Chicken, squid fried was too dry and over cooked but the dessert or shaved ice is pretty good"}
{"text":"I love this place so much and used to come here all the time but it pains me to give it two stars because there was a cockroach crawling on the seat right beside me while I ate my dessert. The server offered us a 10% discount but that definitely was not worth it since I couldn't even finish my food in peace.  Honestly, this is a great place and I know not all restaurants can be 100% clean and insect free. But please for the love of God, call pest control because ain't nobody tryna drink bubble tea and make eye contact with a cockroach at the same time.   The atmosphere and food is great, especially their popcorn chicken. There's a small parking lot available at the back but it is shared with a few other restaurants so don't expect to find a parking spot during dinner hours.    Also, don't park next to the dumpster because that thing is crooked and you will scratch your car, trust me, I know."}
{"text":"This isn't the first time I've been here but I really enjoy the homeyness of their food menu. The prices are reasonable and the food is good! I'm leaving this review bc I'm in a good mood. We ordered deep fried cartilage. When the dish came out, I was thinking this is very meaty  (good, but I expected it to be cartilage crunchy). I had a few pieces with that cartilage crunch. After 1/3 through another plate with fried popcorn things arrived. We were all confused and they took that plate away. They later apologize  bc they accidentally gave us popcorn chicken. No problem bc chicken is more expensive than cartilage. We move on to our dinner. Anyway, they actually ended up packing the cartilage for us. Which is awesome! It's a small gesture but I've seen so many places just throw away incorrect/duplicate dishes. Or even drinks. What a waste! It's funny bc i jked earlier  to my bf that if they give that catiladge to us, I'll come back. Guess I'm coming back ;)"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and the line was out the door. Despite the reviews on bad service I still wanted to try their desserts because they're just so visually appealing!  Got the black sesame parfait and chocolate waffle. Both looked just like in the photos. The parfait had some weird dense cream that didn't taste like ice cream or whipped cream. Personally found it kind of gross. The waffle took 20 min and it was limp and cold. Service isn't bad in the sense that they are all nice people, but they just don't seem to know how to run a business. A lot of the times the servers are sort of just standing around when we've asked for water or extra utensils. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I used UberEats to get food from here, I got the chocolate and white cheesecake and the mango milk bubble tea. To be honest, everything tasted pretty basic, nothing really stood out. It was good but not great, I have a strong feeling the cakes were not fresh.   I liked how they made the take out box look pretty, it was a nice detailed touch. Everything came on time and we weren't made to wait.  Got the golden mango sago. It was OKAY. It wasn't super sweet which I liked, but honestly could barely make out the mango taste."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for the second time ever. I'm a fan of their mango sago with pearl delight ($4.99) and it never fails to hit the spot for me.   Overall, the dessert variety is excellent, the decor is pretty cute and creative, service here is not spectacular, the hygiene is questionable...also the durian smell I cannot stand but for that perfect mango sago with pearl delight it is totally worth it. I would recommend ordering dessert from here on uber eats. Use my promo code for $10 off your next order eats-carlyh378."}
{"text":"Nice little joint when you feel like snacking or having a sweet tooth. The reason why i rated this as Aok simply because its CASH ONLY, street parking can be limited depending on the time of day and i saw a few flies when I was about to order my food.    We got the teriyaki poutine, lychee and sago, and the taro and pearl delight (HOT). Poutine is a must try and the desserts were pleasant and comforting.   Will definitely be coming back since they had good service and to try out their wide selections of desserts."}
{"text":"worst service ever! Waitress served water with fingers in glasses, served wrong food, inpatient, never serve food in front of each person, just drop it and leave."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the signature dessert and regular sweet items from this place. It is probably my favorite dessert restaurant in Markham.   It is clean and soft lighted. I would say this is a relaxing space for family and friends.  They accept Vicinity program and offer affiliated promotion.  Price is reasonable but it is quite busy when there was only one server when we left around 8pm.  We came early after an early dinner. It was easy to get our server attention. Great dessert chef and friendly server.  Generally, I would recommend it to my friends.  We will be back to try other savoury and drinks."}
{"text":"My friend and I came for some late-night dessert and were not disappointed! I had simple coconut milk with sago - the coconut milk was not watered down like it is at other places. My only complaint was that it was served cold - I wish there was a hot option available. My friend had the Matcha Shaved Ice with Red Bean and Matcha Ice Cream which was absolutely delicious and very nicely presented. Will be back.  PAYMENT OPTIONS: Cash only."}
{"text":"Great service, great prices we always get the popcorn chicken, three cup chicken and the braised meat items.   The braised meat always comes out soft and savoury.  They have a lot of Taiwanese desserts and bobba. The cheesecakes and shaved ice are greaaat!"}
{"text":"I love their mango sago and mango pancake!   I tried the golden pearl drink and mango pearl delight - disappointing.  Their bubble tea was really disgusting. Please do yourself a favor and don't order their bubble tea.  The wait staff are your typical Chinese workers with no personality but you can't complain because they do their job."}
{"text":"Sugar Marmalade is a decent dessert joint. Prices are surprisingly cheap, service is attentive. there are plenty of options to choose from, and the place is clean. Only downside is that it's cash only."}
{"text":"Just ordered preserved chicken and Chinese sausage dish. The presentation looks good however the Chinese sausage is soo little. It's unacceptable since I only got like 3 pieces.   I also ordered a strawberry banana smoothie. Every time I ordered it, it has a different colour.   Summary Presentation 6/10 Taste 6/10 Price 5/10  Would only recommend if you are looking for dessert and have no where else to go"}
{"text":"Portions were small and service was very confusing. After asking another customer, we realized you had to fill in your name on a piece of paper that was hung outside the door to get in line for a table."}
{"text":"THE GOOD: The menu has a diverse number of items, from bubble teas to traditional Asian desserts to full on meals.  I'm a huge fan of lychee-flavoured things, so I've tried their Special Lychee Aloe Drink and their Lychee Black Pearl Delight, both of which I enjoyed.  The prices themselves are not overly ridiculous.  THE BAD: Though the menu boasts a lot of items, be careful because from the few times I've been here, they're always out of stock on several ingredients so you might not be able to order your first, or second, or third, or fourteenth choice.  The last time I came here with my friends, one of them ordered the chocolate egg waffle and was told that they were out of the chocolate batter.  Another ordered the green tea egg waffle and was told they were out of green tea ice cream.  The thing is, he was only told 45 minutes into us having ordered and when he told the waitress he wanted to order something else instead, she informed him that the his egg waffle was already made, so he would have to stick with his order, but pick another ice cream flavour instead.  ...what?  That's terrible customer service.  Somehow, it gets worse.  Finally when his egg waffle came, there were no red beans, as was shown in the picture.  Instead, they had substituted them for bananas, and when we asked the waitress what was going on, she informed us that they were out of red beans.  I don't know how they can run an Asian dessert restaurant without green tea ice cream or red beans.  To top things off, the egg waffles themselves were extremely mediocre.  Also, one time I tried to order the Mango Mochi for takeout and was told that they \"couldn't guarantee the quality of it in takeout\".  O...kay?  So I tried to order it during a sit-in, but was then told that it hasn't been a menu item for a while.  I give up.  All in all, not the best dessert place.  There are a few items I like, but I won't be coming back regularly."}
{"text":"Food/dishes and entrees are terrible. If you want microwaved foods, then definitely go here. In my case, definitely never going for dishes again. The pictures looked great but its just decieving. When my bf ate the meat from his beef braised noodles - the meat was hard cold and the soup is barely hot but the plate bowl was hot  -dessert is not bad.  So all in all. Dont eat here when you're hungry but if you're craving for sweets then this place is good to go.  PS Dont eat hot desserts - again it'll be microwaved"}
{"text":"3.5  I came here a few times and every time, it was busy.   I tried the mango shaved ice - Taiwanese style shaved ice with lots of mango flavours. if you love mangos this is a good dish for you. It is good portion size for 2 people to share.   I tried other stuff like Oreo pudding which was meh. They have a wide menu which I would like to try. Service is meh, you have to get their attention. Not sure if the call button doesn't work or if it's neglected? We rang there button twice but no one came to our table.   Other than the service, price is OK, good desserts and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday afternoon with my co-workers. I've been to multiple locations of Sugar Marmalade and I have to say this particular one didn't stand out. Even though there were 3 servers and 3 tables, it was difficult to catch the attention of just one. The floors were sticky and the place looked a little dingy.   I had ordered the Golden Treasures Mixed Sago ($6.99). It wasn't bad but I do wish there were more mangoes in it! My coworker ordered their Japanese style popcorn chicken ($7.99), which to my surprise, wasn't bad. Another coworker ordered their House Special Sago Mango and Watermelon Juice ($5.49). Although I didn't have any, he seemed to really enjoy it.  I think I will come back when I'm really craving Chinese desserts, but keep in mind it is CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of desserts, but Sugar Marmalade will be one place on my list for sure. Been a couple times at the London location and was pretty satisfied (even though they had just opened) so I was familiar with some of their offerings. Located within First Markham Place, parking might be tough depending on the time of day. Came around 10:00 pm on a Thursday, and waited for roughly 20 mins for two people.   Ordered two pancakes (mango - 6.49 and durian - 7.49) to share with my friend.   **IT WAS MY FIRST TIME EATING DURIAN** so take this for what it's worth. Let's just say I figured out I'm not the biggest fan of durian because it tasted just like the smell. But still, the ice cream and chocolate drizzle mixed with the pancake tasted decent!   Loved the mango pancake! There was a healthy portion of mango as well as ice cream. Portion wise it was a lot but the flavor was sweet and not overpowering. Definitely would prefer this over breakfast pancakes every day of the week!   Service was very quick when seated, although I wish they had some sort of system to track the queue for waiting. With the staff being so busy, it was hard to find out exactly how long the wait would be. Price wise, I think its more than reasonable considering how big the desserts are. They offer drinks as well and sago - will definitely be back for those!"}
{"text":"Worst service and food I have ever had in my entire life !!!  I heard a lot of great things about their Ontario locations so I was super excited to try Sugar Marmalade. We arrived on a Wednesday night around 8:30pm. The place was quite busy but we only waited for about 5 minutes to get a table. Once we were seated, one of the waitresses handed us the menu right away.   We ordered popcorn chicken, minced pork dish , a mango bubble tea, condensed milk toast and the matcha panna cotta. A minute later, one of the staffs came over to us and mentioned that the condensed milk toast is sold out for the night. OKAY?!  Uhm y'all just opened a couple of weeks ago, you don't close until 10pm. How the hell are you running out of food already?! Anyways, moving on.... the popcorn chicken and the minced pork dish arrived. Worst popcorn chicken I have ever had, some of the popcorn chicken they served me were not fully cooked!!! The minced pork dish was even worse, lack of flavour, dry, and it tasted old. So at this point, I was just waiting for the bubble tea and the panna cotta, hoping it will change my perspective about this place, maybe they're just having a bad day or they're understaffed or whatever. So one of the ladies came with a panna cotta that I did NOT order. She gave me black sesame instead of matcha and I told her it wasn't what I ordered and she tried to tell me that it was what I ordered. UHM WTF at this point I just wanted to leave but I really wanted the desserts. So another lady came over and told me that the matcha panna cotta is sold out as well. AAAAAAAAAAAHHHH ! So I ended up ordering the mocha hazelnut pannacotta . She then told me that it is usually topped with vanilla ice cream but they didn't have any left either so I ended up getting green tea ice cream instead. The mango bubble tea was nothing special, I'd rather just go to chatime. The mocha hazelnut panna cotta was terrible, i will choose to wait and line up outside of kazu in the middle of a snowstorm any day for their overpriced panna cotta.   I was tired, disappointed, annoyed, irritated and disgusted. I told one of the staffs that the popcorn chicken was uncooked and she said sorry and giggled and still charged us for the full price!!   To conclude this rant, visiting this place was a waste of time and money for us. The food was more than terrible, it made me sick and the service was unacceptable. I wish I can give this place negative stars."}
{"text":"Extremely watered down sago, decent shaved ice. The serve did accommodate to us when we wanted to return the sago as it was WAAY too runny for my liking. Also they only take cash so make sure to have some on you."}
{"text":"Ordered Take-Out for a late night snack and was utterly disappointed, mind you I've been to the other locations countless times and not once have a ever felt such disgust. The popcorn chicken that I get from the other location is crispy and balanced in flavour but this one was overly salty and had teriyaki sauce on top of it? I was a little confused as I made a order for REGULAR popcorn chicken. The minced pork on rice was standard fare, nothing wonderful or hateful to say about it. All the food was cold and soggy by the time I got home and I live less than 5 minutes away. Cannot comment on customer service or environment since I got take out."}
{"text":"Asian deserts are usually less sugary. The taste is milder but also more smooth. Sugar marmalade does a decent job.   We had one desert and one meal item. Both were Ok. Nothing that made me go wow. We both consumed the food without much commentary. That's how you know the food is just ok. That's partly because we're both Asian and had this kind of food before. I suppose if it's your first time you'd have a bigger reaction than us.   Big props to the artists who made the pictures. Too bad the real things don't look as good. The pictures made me have extraordinary expectations and ultimately I was let down a little. It was still delicious of course. By the end, I didn't feel a strong urge to come again. But it's nice to have a Chinese dessert place here."}
{"text":"We walked in around 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday night and we luckily were given booth seats right away.  Immediately after we were seated, the line-ups at the door started.  There were so many people here on a Saturday night!  There were mostly families with young kids here.  Thus, the place was a little loud and it looked like the servers' patience were stretched thin (when we paid the bill, the servers looked very frantic in serving new customers and taking care of orders.  It took a while before we were given our bill and a take-out box).  Sugar Marmalade is primarily a dessert place (you can see this in their menu where the first couple of pages are all devoted to so many different categories of Chinese desserts and drinks with Western influences and only a couple of pages in the back for Taiwanese appetizers and rice dishes).  Ironically enough, we didn't end up ordering any desserts here even though I was certainly curious about them.  However, I thought that the desserts were a bit overpriced...  As always, I like to order popcorn chicken!  The Taiwanese Style Popcorn Chicken here was $7.49 per portion and good thing that it actually arrived in a substantial portion!  It was served with a side of Thai sweet and spicy sauce too (interesting...).  I was actually quite impressed with their popcorn chicken!  It was salty enough for my taste and didn't have too much batter either.  The first couple of pieces were so delicious!  However, after we left it on the table for a while, I noticed that the latter pieces -- having been cooled down -- had a more obvious batter taste that was chunky.  K got a rice dish, the Chicken & Chinese Mushroom on Steamed Rice.  I was surprised to see this presented on a plate when it arrived.  It seemed more fitting that this type of dish be served in a bowl.  Anyway, the rice when mixed with the sauce was quite good as were the mushroom and chicken pieces.  There was nothing special about it but it was still good."}
{"text":"It is a pretty cute place!  Came in during dinner time, so no one was really there except my friend and I. The service was pretty good, they were friendly and greeted us once we walked in. They often checked up on us and refilled our water. Everything was very cleaned, pretty comfortable and played lots of popular Asian music.   The menu had a huge selection ranging from desserts and entree meals! They got stuff like pudding, soya bean options, toasts and shaved ice for desserts. Chicken wings, calamari, Japanese teriyaki fries and lots of rice options! And for drinks, they got lots of bubble tea flavours and Italian sodas to choose from!   Prices do seem fare, and does fill you up. I ordered a fresh watermelon-mango juice and it was def very refreshing and some sort of mango pancake thing. The total was only $12 which is honestly a great deal for a nice little place to catch up with a friend.   This is located near Finch and Midland, right across from Chatime! I believe this is a CASH-ONLY place, as there is an ATM near the door!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: its gotten a lot better but the price is still an issue.  Sorry for being Canadian, but we like to be penny pinchers. For a snack bar most people expect to try more foods for the same price you go out to eat. Sugar marmalade doesnt make it easy to do that.  FOOD: 4/5 SERVICE: 2/5 COST: 2/5 BUILDING:4/5  FOOD: a lot better than before and a lot more choices than before. Food is now served hot and prepared nicely. However they go heavy handed with the salt.  SERVICE: waiters seems pretty dreaded to be working, they will not find you a seat. You have to press a button to call them and sometimes they dont answer.  COSTS: everything costs around 6.99-12.99, entree portions are dismissable for the price we pay.  Building: pretty well built and im happy for all the ringers available at our tables as we never have to flag down anyone! However no Wifi.  **MUST TRY** - popcorn Taiwanese chicken **AVOID** entrees as theyre just mostly snacks + rice or noodles lol."}
{"text":"I came here last night and ordered the Green Tea & Red Bean Taiwanese Shaved Ice and I was a little disappointed. I don't know if I was eating with my eyes because the pictures on the menu looked amazing. But when I received the shaved ice there wasn't as many toppings as on the menu.  Don't get me wrong it was good but not great...  I expected more from this place.   I'll give this place another shot and *hopefully* it's a lot better. But for now this place gets 3 stars.."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant in Mississauga.  My husband and I ordered the beef brisket with noodles and the curry chicken.  It was delicious.  The service was great.  I like how they have buzzers at each table to get the servers attention.  We also ordered dessert.  The dessert was amazing.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Not sure why I thought the Vaughan location of sugar marmalade might be better than the one in markham. Maybe it's the familiarity of the chain that led me in. We ordered the Chang fen (rice noodles with peanut and soy sauce paste) and a minced pork noodle. They were both pretty bad. The rice noodles were not fully steamed and kind of hard. Don't come here for food food - maybe their desserts are much better."}
{"text":"my friend highly recommended this place when I travel to Toronto, and I love dessert, so I decided to give it a try. Kinda disappointed though. It's super busy little restaurant, the service was not great, maybe becuz it's a busy night and there's only one waitress which made me felt I have to memorize the food I wanted to order once she stop by I have to finish placing order in less the 1 mins, that's pretty challenge esp for new customers. the food came out pretty fast though."}
{"text":"- Great menu and lots of dish/drink variations to choose from. - Prices are very reasonable which will probably keep me coming back. - Service wasn't the best. Gotta get their attention and some waiters don't speak English so it was a bit hard to communicate which wasn't a big deal. - Waffle desserts weren't the greatest. A bit bland and dry. - They only take cash but they have an ATM machine. - Environment is nice but just a bit small so it can get busy at times. I probably won't be going at prime dinner hours. - Its also a bit loud because tables are slightly close to each other."}
{"text":"Being chinese and born in Montreal, I was soooo happy to hear that a legit chinese dessert place will be opened in Montreal!   Went there at least twice during their soft opening. The dessert was good, up to my expectations. Went there a second time, they forgot my order. I thought it could be possible since it was really busy and they newly opened...  Went there again this month, ordered a steamed milk with ginger, what I got was literally watery milk with a slight taste of ginger. And not to mention that they forgot my order also (again...), so I had to wait almost an hour to get that... and I have to mention that the store was not even half full and that the staff did not even bother to apologize."}
{"text":"Dessert place just right at the plaza of first Markham place. The durian pancakes is very yummy and the green tea and red bean Taiwanese shaved ice is really good."}
{"text":"Food was okay however customer service was the worst experience ever. How is the restaurant going to open until 2 yet let their customers know that they are closed at 12.... I wasn't one of those customers but rather than having a sign that says closed at 2, they should really re-evaluate closing hours. If you want to get the waitresses attention you might as well walk up to them than to use the button. Food was so average if you want a nice dessert place would HIGHLY recommend some other place. Lack of seating arrangements anyways....not worth the wait or the money"}
{"text":"Everytime I finish eating here, I tell myself never again but somehow find myself coming back once in a while due to its variety in the menu.  First of all in a super big fan of Asian desserts! However the desserts I've tried at this location disappoints. I ordered the Hong Kong egg waffle with Icecream- and unlike the ones you have at pacific mall they are extremely dry and not creamy tasting.  The food that comes out does not look like the pictures.. However I did order the takoyaki fries & the fried chicken bites which were very good. Everything else.. Not so much."}
{"text":"Super. Small. Cozy. Modern. I really enjoyed this place! It had a very modern feel to it with all the dark and white furniture. Everything had a very minimalistic touch to it and I find that great because it puts all the attention on the food and not the surrounding. The only drawback of this place was the size. I found the space very tight, tables were almost edge to edge and the serving counter ventured off too far into the walk space. It's one thing to maximize work space, but obstructing walkways make it a hazard.  As for the food, I thought it was pretty good. We ordered the Japanese style popcorn chicken, mango roll surpreme and Oreo coffee milkshake. Chicken was good, but nothing I haven't had before. I think it's pretty similar to Cha Me Cha, but that doesn't mean it was bad. It came smokin' hot and the chicken was juicy and tender. The mango surpreme was great as well, but just not my thing since sweets and I aren't best friends. However, drinks I don't mind, which is why I ordered the Oreo coffee milkshake. All I could say was, \"DAMN!\" That was probably the BEST shake I've ever had in my short existance of life. Then again I don't drink much sweets either, but this drink is a close second to water and coffee  (.. it was coffee Lol). The shake was thick and in a good amount because it was just so heavy. I was thoroughly full by the last sip, but I had to finish the chicken too. There's always room for meat!  Overall a good place to hang out, but come in a small group. The lack of space made me think twice about giving this 4 stars, so if safety is an issue, visit the First Markham Place location. Otherwise, try to sit close to the door where there's a little more room. 3"}
{"text":"Standard kind of this type of restaurant.  Staff was friendly and they have the little button that allows you to call the staff (convenient!).  Ordered the Black Sesame Panicotta and it was alright.  The black sesame ice cream is pretty solid quality.    Friends ordered the chilled sago + fruit desserts and said it was alright.  Also got an order of the crispy chicken - a tad salty and flavoured like takoyaki."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm writing a review like this on Yelp. If I could give a rating of 0, I would.   I went here with 3 other people, and after being seated we were pretty much ignored for the entire time. We had to wait 30 minutes before they? would even take our order (we were trying to get their  attention a couple of times, but nothing). After we gave our order we only received 2 of them (the mango pancakes). Our green tea shaved ice never came.    The whole time we were there no one checked up on us nor were we given any water. This was extremely frustrating especially because the tables around us were getting great service! There was a group of people who came in around 30 minutes after us and got their orders promptly (including 2 orders of shaved ice!).   I am very dissappointed with Sugar Marmalade. Not sure what to think, but I felt extremely alienated?, especially coupled with the fact we were the only table that was not from East Asian decent...  I will never come back to this establishment, nor will I recommend this place to anyone after the treatment my friends and I received."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken popcorn and french fries. Fries were clearly previously frozen. No good taste. Popcorn chicken was disgusting. Overly greasy with some more tastless mayonnaise grease on it. It went in the garbage."}
{"text":"Ummh, I've been wanting to try this dessert place for a while and it was kind of a disappointment. I ordered the litchi sago and it had a plain taste. And how ironic it is that this place fits at least 40 seats but when we asked for 4 glasses of water, they came with only two and told us they didn't have any left. We weren't even 10 in the store. You also can't pay with debit or credit if your bill doesn't cost more than 10$. As far as I know, I did not see an ATM machine anywhere. Also, I ordered the minced pork stirred with rice noodles for takeout and it looked nothing like the picture on the menu, let alone the taste of it, which tasted like it had salad dressing instead of anything else. Anyways, I must say that unlike my dessert, my friends' plates had a great presentation and they do have a lot of variety in their menu. Still, I would probably not come back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Ordered the black sesame parfait, green tea panna cotta, house special mango dessert, and Japanese style popcorn chicken. Prices and portions are on par with similar set ups, service was quick and friendly. I found the chicken to be overly salty, but the desserts were good. The black sesame ice cream was just ok, didn't have that inherent seaside taste. All in all a good spot to go to for dessert."}
{"text":"Yay another Chinese dessert place!   There was plenty of seating even I went and I immediately noticed they had a call service button at every table so naturally, I used it even though there was only 2-3 tables being occupied but hey, the workers had their backs facing the tables the entire time. And the button was loud!  Anyways, straight to the food review. I came on a very empty stomach... Drinks: they had a good selection of drinks. I assumed this place would be like any other bubble tea joint with desserts but it's not. They didn't have that many milk teas and bubble teas per sé but they did have other fun drinks similar but different. I went for a typical honey milk tea which was good and not too sweet. Food: I then ordered the popcorn chicken rice, squid tentacles, Japanese fries. All satisfying my cravings although the rice dish I got was very dry, considering t what I got, so when I asked if they had any sauces the waitress said she only had hot sauce. So I basically should have just ordered the popcorn chicken on its own.  Dessert: the marshmallow toast was good but quite dry. Very filling too. And I got a mango sago dessert which was very delicious.  I'd come back for their desserts and drinks but I'll opt out of their food choices next time."}
{"text":"Came here on their opening weekend when they still had their Facebook check-in promo happening. The place was quite busy. I came on a weekend at around 7pm. We were lucky that they had one table free at the time, otherwise we probably would've had to wait another 15+ mins to be seated. From their menu you can expect the same as you would at other Chinese/Taiwanese dessert places. But I find their selection here is a lot bigger than most.  We decided to order the Fresh Durian with Sago Mixed, Durian Mochi Deluxe (4pc), and Green Tea and Red Bean Taiwanese Shaved Ice. All the orders came out pretty fast. The shaved ice is delicious! Love the combination of green tea and red bean in anything. Similar in taste to other dessert places, like ZenQ and Cha Me Cha, but good to know there's another solid place in Markham if you ever need your shaved ice cream fix!   The Durian Sago was nice and light. There's a few fresh mango chunks in the dessert as well. If you're a fan of durian, you'll love this as much as I did! I liked this better than the shaved ice actually. Between the two of us, we were so full just from these two dessert that we could barely eat the mochi! The durian mochi was sooo good though. Fresh durian in the centre, very aromatic flavour coming through, and just the perfect dessert. I will say though, that the mochi layer could be thinner as it was a bit on the thicker side. But other than that, this is a solid dessert spot if you're ever in the area. I'd definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place given the large assortment of unique desserts. However the bad attitude of unattentive servers and long wait for the food prevents me from ever coming here again."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday evening after dinner at 7-ish. The place was already getting crowded but we were lucky to snatch the last open table. There were only 2 ladies working the place and they were clearly understaffed.   We ordered the matcha panna cotta (cold) and the mango black glutinous rice soup (hot). My panna cotta came missing a crucial topping... no big deal.. I'll just ask for that topping on the side, except it took quite a while to get someone's attention to ask for the topping. The matcha panna cotta dessert comes with crunchy cereal, sweet red beans, mochi, and a scoop of matcha ice cream. The ice cream is fine (not very strong matcha flavor), the red beans and mochi are good,... but the panna cotta underneath is barely edible because it was so hard. Whoever made it used way too much gelatin... I can overlook the lack of flavor, but it shouldn't take \"effort\" to dig into a panna cotta, especially not when you're using a big metal spoon!  The black glutinous rice dessert is pleasant enough, although unfortunately the mango (in the topping) did not appear to be in season.   The service was a bare minimum... hard to get anyone's attention for very long. I don't blame the staff, but it def doesn't help the experience.  By the time we left (8-ish pm), there is a line at the door. Try this place at your own risk, but it's definitely NOT worth lining up for.   The place has so much potential... but needs better execution"}
{"text":"Got the coconut milk with glutinous rice dessert. It was wayyyyyy too thick and gloopy. Taste was ok but texture was totally off. The environment of this place didn't feel that comfy and felt unfinished. Overall meh place, def better options around."}
{"text":"I was having dinner near the area and decided to go to this place for dessert with some coworkers. I wasn't too keen just because of the mixed reviews but out of convenience decided to visit anyways. They had a wide selection of desserts from mille-feuille to egg waffles etc. I decided to keep it simple and opted for a black sesame parfait. It had a ball of black sesame ice cream, mango chunks, vanilla ice cream in between, and two strawberry pocky sticks. It was a sort of weird mish mash of things. I was hoping for more black sesame in general instead of just a ball of it, but it was okay. Not one of the most memorable but it wasn't horrible.  I take off a lot of points for service, and that's just me. I believe service is just as important because it really provides an experience. I say this because it's a dessert place. I mean good service at a dessert place...why not? Keep in mind this place was in no way busy at all.   The only waitress there when serving the parfait, held the spoons out. I was waiting for her to put it down and was confused, but she held it there for quite awhile. I grabbed it from her hand because I realized she wanted me to take it from her hands? She also chucked the napkin at our table and it spun a few rounds (it was a light napkin...seriously)  and landed on the table.  She also stood behind my chair, standing there not moving while I tried to grab my jacket and bag when I was ready to leave. She was sort of in the way? It was just really strange.  Perhaps it's just awkward service overall and not necessarily \"bad\". Either way it left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. Will not come again."}
{"text":"Love the desserts here because I can't have gluten, dairy or egg which is often in pastry desserts. But think twice about ordering takeout on a weekend--took more than 30 minutes! Unacceptable! The least they could've done was let us know BEFORE ordering. To make matters worse, a waitress actually pushed her body into me as she leaned over the cash desk to place a order slip into a peg. Then, she asked me to go stand by the door!"}
{"text":"Not bad. First time being here. We felt like an afternoon dessert snack today and since Tracey dessert a few doors down close-up, we decided.to check this place out.   Upon walking in, it was cute and cozy ... I preferred the booth seats opposed to the chairs, ambiance was like a coffee house but a bit cold inside. Maybe they should turn up the heat just a tad bit considering it's the middle of winter.   Our waiter had no expression, neither happy or welcoming. Maybe they should train their servers to be a bit more welcoming instead of having a stone cold facial expression though.  But this seems typical of Chinese service. You rarely get smiley or happy expressive waiters. Their facial expressions usually are unwelcoming, or just no expression at all. That is one place this restaurant can work on.   Overall, the desserts were good. I mean, nothing crazy beyond my expectations. But just good overall. We ordered the house special dessert and a mango crepe with sesame ice cream and a lychee dessert with basil seeds and Mochi inside it. The 3 came put pretty quickly and they were not overly sugary which is perfect for me. I hate the heavy sugar desserts. So this was good.   Overall, I give this place a 4 star because of the lack in service. I didn't get any good impression from our waitress. She felt stone cold and super dry.  Work on that and I'm sure you'll get more happy clients leaving and feeling that this place would love to have more customers returning."}
{"text":"I've seen pictures of Sugar Marmalade all over the instagram and have been dying to try it out. So I finally got to on a cold wet winter day.  First off all the food matches the instagram worthy pics.   The decor on the wall is super cute with dessert puns plastered all over. The place is very small though, only one row of tables. Able to fit 20 people max. What bothered me was that it was freezing out and it was also cold inside. It felt like the heat was not turned on or it was on really low. The tables were also seated really close to the door so it was uncomfortable for them. My table kept their jackets on.  The food was good and insta worthy but the wait for it was meh. It took a while for the food to arrive but when it did arrive at least it was hot and not luke warm like other places. The menu had a lot to offer, mainly different types of fusion and asian desserts. If I were to come back I would like to come back for the desserts rather than an entree."}
{"text":"The dessert was good and so was the service... I had an egg waffle, with strawberry and vanilla ice cream, so really how can they mess that up.  The waffle was a lot crispier than I expected which was good since it gave a nice texture to mix with the melting ice cream and whipped cream."}
{"text":"I noticed this dessert spot on Yelp prior to our trip to Markham and it really caught my eye, so a night after eating a lobster feast in Fishman Lobster Clubhouse my cousin, fiance, and I decided to to come here for dessert.   It has a dark a gray, modern, and chic atmosphere. It can definitely get crowded towards the evening hours, but luckily we were able to get a table for three. They serve a wide variety of desserts, snacks, beverages and etc. Everything was presented very beautifully and creative.  So we had the following:  Golden Treasures Mixed (fresh mango, aloe, popping yogurt bubble, sago, grapefruit special mango juice base) - my fiance ordered this dessert which looked really good and fresh! I enjoyed it. It was sweet and very mango-ey!  House Special Black Grass Jelly (black grass jelly sago, popping yogurt boba, tapioca, coconut milk and ice cream) - the picture of this dessert caught my eye so I decided to order it. It was amazing, fresh, and not too sweet. The mango gave a little tangy flavor to the dessert.   Golden Royal Drink (fresh mango, aloe, popping yogurt bubble, special creamy mango base) - my cousin ordered this drink which is similar to the dessert my fiance ordered, but in a beverage form. Looked very bright and mellow!   Overall, I really liked the desserts here. It's definitely more creative and fresh than the ones we have in New York City. The price is about the same, maybe dessert in Canada is a little cheaper. I definitely would love to come back here again because there are a lot of other desserts I'd like to try. I would highly recommend trying this place out because the service is on point and desserts are amazing!    Tip: This place is CASH only."}
{"text":"Ordered the sweet milk pudding, lychee and aloe drink,  and strawberry shaved ice. My friends also got 2 other drinks that I can't remember the name of. The shaved ice was extremely good and was pretty big. The sweet milk pudding was also pretty good, and the portion was also big, perfect for sharing! However, the milk pudding couldve been creamier. The drinks here are also very good and refreshing, but are on the smaller side for the price."}
{"text":"Went there a couple weeks ago and tried their frostbite taro drink and a golden treasures mix, which both took 20-25 min to get, which is pretty ridiculous (wasn't too crowded either).   The golden treasures mix which was pretty good, however the drink was disgusting. There were chunks of powder in it. Tried mixing it but it was still was sitting out pieces of powder. Complained to the staff and they said it was supposed to taste powdery because they use powder milk. Considering it was a 6$ drink, not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Pretty standard bubble tea place. They have a pretty extensive menu with some options I had never seen before and lots of pictures, which made it very hard for an indecisive person like me to decide on what I wanted. I ended up deciding on the Black Glutinous Rice with Mango & Coconut Milk. It was pretty decent. I would like to go back to try their shaved ice to see how it compares, but otherwise may venture somewhere new next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"We came here around 11pm at night on a Sunday. It was extremely crowded but I guess because a lot of people were in large groups. To my surprise we got seated right away with a party of 2. Initially we thought we'd just take it to go because of how packed it was. I thought it was kind of weird that you had to write your order on a piece of paper and hand it to the waitress but to each its own. Despite the crowdedness, our desserts came pretty fast and they were delicious! I loved how rich and creamy it was without being over powered by sugar."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd visit and 2nd review.  Staff was friendly albeit maybe a bit slow.  She was working the tables by herself though.  When we went (Mar 2018) the deep fryer was broken so a lot of menu items were not available.  See pictures uploaded of each of the 3 items listed below.  We had: 1) AP14 House Special Swiss style chicken wings:  We would order this again as my 2 year old son actually ate some of the meat and enjoyed the sauce.   2) EN9 Pepper Salt Baked Chicken on Rice: Chicken was not over cooked and it was tender.  Flavour on chicken was reasonable and I ate it with the rice to give the rice some flavour.  However, once I finished the chicken it was just plain white rice and I wished they had something else to mix into the rice.  I probably would not order again unless I also ordered something with sauce like AP14 (above) to add to the rice.  3) SM5 Fresh Mango Sago Mix:  wife and son said it was pretty tasty until you finished and ran out of the mango and than it was pretty bland.  Would try other dessert/sago options before going back to this one.  However, they would still order this again."}
{"text":"What is the point of having good food if the customer service sucks. I have visit here at least 5 times to give it a fair chance because everybody makes mistakes. However doing mistakes for all the times I visit means that there is something seriously wrong with the staff of sugar Marmalade. The waitress are slow and lazy. They don't even respond to the button so you have to walk up to them and tell them what you need. Might as well  pay your customers to work for you! In addition while serving you they look at you very clueless and  one time one waitress was eating a chicken leg while helping me pay. It was very gross and unprofessional. Don't go here unless you want your night to be spoiled."}
{"text":"I came here on a  full stomach only wanting a tea. Then I saw the menu and pictures all around the place of their dessert. So I caved and ordered in think it was #17, I think it was $6. It was tapioca pearls with yogurt popping pearls (bizarre and tasty), and some little jelly coconut type thing all in a coconut broth. With vanilla ice cream on top. It was easily one of the best desserts I've had all year.   The service is nothing to brag about, what would you expect from an Asian place. They have hot foods as well, more of a snacks type taiwanese thing.   I would definitely go back to try some of their other desserts."}
{"text":"Checked this place out after a full seafood meal across the street with the family. Review will only be based off what the hubby and wifey ordered.   Wifey is durian crazy! Had durian deluxe drink which needed more durian flavour. Also tried the durian panna cotta which had good strong durian taste but portion was too tiny for price you pay.  Hubby had the bubble waffle which came close to half hour after everyone's order came. Had to remind the servers several times. Don't bother with the bubble waffle. It tasted stale. It was tough to chew unlike all the soft springy bubble waffles we have had elsewhere.  Overall, skip this place. There are better dessert places in the area.  Side note: place is always packed though, considering the lackluster service and forgettable sweets"}
{"text":"After seeing all the Instagram posts of this place, my friends and I really wanted to try this place. The first thing we noticed was that they only accepted cash, so that's a bit of a bummer. Thankfully, I always carry cash with me ;)  Service is not the greatest here. You have to flag someone down each time you want something. The menu doesn't do the greatest job of describing the desserts to you, so you either ask them what it is or order and hope for the best.   We got their strawberry shaved snow, cheesecake, chocolate sundae, and apple slush.   The shaved snow wasn't that good compared to other places. I found it to be really icy, not soft like the other places I've had. The toppings were pretty decent, but the portion was huge and I couldn't finish it. Even with the help of my friends.   The cheesecake was pretty subpar and I could probably cook something better up at home.   My friend asked the server about the chocolate sundae, but the server failed to mention the chocolate jello that would be in it. She was pretty disappointed when she got her dessert and barely touched it.   All in all, we were pretty disappointed with this place after being so excited."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with friends for dessert. The menu has so many options it took me awhile to decide. They also have food and drinks on the menu if you don't just want dessert.   The things we ordered were pretty much pictured in the menus. My friends and I ordered the green tea panna cotta (it looked like a green tea parfait cup with ice cream), matcha bubble waffle, and the HK style rice rolls, and the golden sago mix (mango chunks, and sago in a mango cream).   One things my friends didn't like was that the green tea desserts they ordered had too much red bean (I tried it and I would probably agree, it was just a bit too much. My friend took half of it off the waffle)   Everything was pretty good. If you're looking for Asian dessert there are many options here."}
{"text":"This place has awesome desserts, similar to Hong Kong's Honey Moon desserts. We got the mango special, fruits with mango pudding, and a coconut sauce dessert. I liked the mango the best, but all were good. Definitely worth coming here for desserts. The owner is from Hong Kong, staff are still learning the ropes, but were polite."}
{"text":"My god worth a go. Try it! It won't disappoint. Get BG1 house special black grass jelly mixed."}
{"text":"Decent but quality of food and desserts not nearly as good as some of the asian dessert places on highway 7. Nice atmosphere and service was good (service button was convenient). Durian drink and condensed milk brick toast were very good!"}
{"text":"Here's a game for you. Look at all the quotes on Sugar Marmalade's decorated chalk drawing wall and replace the word \"dessert\" with something else, preferably controversial. While you're waiting for your food, you can create great quotes such as: \"Communism doesn't ask silly questions, communism understands\" and \"I'd give up on racism, but I'm no quitter\".  And you'll need the entertainment as sometimes, it can take a good half an hour to get your food. The food itself is typical Taiwanese snack fare. Good but not anything special. You've got your bubble teas, your Taiwanese fried chicken, and your warm liquid desserts. As a group, my friends and I ordered:  1) Oreo Pudding - First to arrive as there's nothing really special about it. Creamy cold pudding with crunchy Oreo bits, topped with an Oreo. A little too rich and plain to me.   2) Taiwanese Delight - A warm dessert consisting of coconut milk, grass jelly, sago, and other jelly things. When they say \"warm\", they literally mean lukewarm. My friend wanted it to be hot so he asked them to warm it up. It took another 20-25 minutes to come back. We're certain that they nuked it and let it sit there because it came back the same temperature. Not a bad dessert though.  3) Steamed egg white and milk - At $4.99, this is a pretty great option (though you can get the same thing at many dim sum places for $2-3). The dessert was smooth, piping hot, and not too sweet. Since it's freshly steamed, it takes a lot longer to prepare, about 30 mins for me.   Overall, 3.5 for decent desserts at a decent price. Great place to come with a group. Slightly long wait times but nothing a good game of \"what can communism do for you?\" to keep your mind off it.   (2/100) - 2017"}
{"text":"I went to their soft opening a couple weeks ago and I was very impressed with my experience that I came back two more times in the same week lol  The servers were friendly and helpful, maybe a bit too helpful. One of them kept coming and filling our glasses with water and they were still 3/4 full. I don't mind this as there are some restaurants that never refill the water.   I've tried some dishes such as popcorn chicken, noodles with braised beef, Japanese teriyaki fries and I've like everything I've tried so far.   The drinks especially the Italian soda not only tastes good, but are presented nicely as well, perfect for an Instagram picture.   Overall I've had a good experience all the times I've went and will definitely come again."}
{"text":"New dessert place in Montreal.....a lot of waitress...but no experience.....you can get 15% off when u pay cash....I will back again and try the other things....."}
{"text":"One thing I didn't like was so many cash only sign. The dessert was very average. The place felt not clean. The only thing I like was the service. The waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"Serving is pretty good. We'll surely come back at this place. My daughter loved their entrees and its nice to have all meals done in one.  They only accept cash but have an ATM around for convenience."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert and got the mango pancake and green tea with red bean shaved ice (didn't get a pic). Both dishes were very good and the presentation was on point. The servers were attentive and efficient. Price point is a little bit more expensive for dessert but it's worth it. Will come back and get the salty food next time!"}
{"text":"Straight to the point. Very decent Chinese dessert place to go to in North York.  Only 10 min walk away from my house. Bonus! I had the Black glutinous rice with coconut milk and coconut bits. I thought it was a good amount considering most people would probably come here after dinner.  My sister had the mango with rice balls. She enjoyed it. I thought it was okay. Everyone has their own taste, right?  Prices are reasonable to me. As Chinese desserts will always cost more than Chinese food.   Only complaint, it can get loud here when it's busy. That includes a Tuesday night as well.   Ill be back to try other stuff"}
{"text":"Before tasting the dessert, I thought, the prices are pretty fair. Not too expensive, but considering the quality of the desserts, now I think it was overpriced or just not worth it in general.  went for dessert here after dinner at Tsuki down the street. We had 6 people and all ordered something, and tried a bit of each. (pics will be uploaded soon) None of us ordered the shaved ice, cause we heard many bad things about it from friends, no matter how it looks, in the end, it's just ice.  The WORST was the OREO pudding, it was only layers of whipped cream (from a can) and layers of oreo. felt like it was putting fat into my body by eating this.  got a red bean drink (yuck), a mixed fruit sago and 3 different kinds of mango flavoured dessert, all tasted the same.  not good for large groups."}
{"text":"I've been to the Sugar Marmalade in Mississauga so many times and honestly after my most recent visit at this one, I think I'll make the 30 minute drive just to avoid going to the Yonge St location.   I walked in and stood by the door waiting for someone to just simply greet and seat me, no one did. So I wandered to find a seat as the layout was very tight and a table was getting cleaned so I was a little confused so I went to their bar and asked one of the staff if I can just choose any seat and he didn't understand me and brought in another worker which told me to sit anywhere I'd like.   I chose the table they literally just cleaned and no one acknowledged me to give me a menu for like 5 minutes until the waitress came and asked if I needed a menu......   The washrooms smelt horrible, comparable to washrooms back in Vietnam but noted that Vietnam does not have a proper plumbing system, this place does. I felt disgusted to touch anything in there and had to cover my face not because someone USED the washroom but the smell of the washroom itself.   Food was meh, service was bad, washrooms are horrible. Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Food 1/5 Dessert and drinks 5/5  Made the  mistake of ordering food.  The chicken wing with noodles was plain and tasteless.  It was basically just the chicken placed on top of the bland noodles.  Frozen food from the grocery store would have tasted better.  The drinks and dessert were on the other side of the spectrum.  (Or it was better than it really was after having the terrible noodles).   The mango slush actually had mangos and was quite good.  Service was not too bad, but don't expect restaurant quality service.  The waitress did fill up our waters once in a while and it wasn't too hard to get her attention.  As mentioned in other reviews - cash only."}
{"text":"Their popcorn chicken and shaved ice is really good. The place is really small but it's cute, not ideal for big groups of more than 6 people. The only downside is that it is a cash only payment but they have an ATM"}
{"text":"I picked 3 items on the menu and he each time I picked one he said they don't have it. If you don't have it then please take it off the menu and update it. Prices are okay for what they give and presentation wise looks pretty good too."}
{"text":"Sugar Marmalade is an above average establishment in the realm of Chinese desserts.  I had the pleasure of dining-in at their First Markham Place location last night.  My companion and I were greeted and seated enthusiastically by their staff.  This establishment seats approximately 30 persons; thus, you may have to wait for a table to vacate during peak hours.  The decor was particularly nice; decorated with illustrations of their desserts on the black walls.  Much nicer than your average, no-frills Chinese dessert hole in the wall.  I ordered the Golden Mixed Sago (E1), while my companion ordered the Mango Pancake with ice cream.  I kid you not, 5 seconds after I placed my order, it appeared in front of me.  The time spent with my Golden Mixed Sago is a time I will cherish.  I will look back and reflect fondly upon the delicate tapioca pearls floating in the sea of mango juice.  I will remember the generous chunks of mango they so carefully placed together, just as the ancient Egyptians carefully placed the stones to construct the pyramids.  Let's not forget about the positive energy radiated by their staff.  Every interaction was accompanied with a smile and assurance that your needs would be taken care of.  This is level of service is rare when dining at a Chinese establishment; it must not be overlooked.  Sugar Marmalade is definitely one of the sweeter Chinese dessert places one can visit.  Try it out and don't look back."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I absolutely love Asian desserts and some of these Sugar Marmalade items really hit the spot. My friend and I ordered the Taro with Sago Mixed (Sweet Taro & Sago in Coconut Milk Base) and the House Special Mango Black Grass Jelly Mixed (Fresh Mango, Black Grass Jelly & Grapefruit in Creamy Mango Juice Base). They were both really good and I would definitely recommend trying it for yourself. The only issue is that they're VERY sweet! But hey it is a dessert restaurant after all.   The service was okay. There was only one server throughout the entire time we were there, and although she was extremely nice, it took quite a bit of time to get her attention.   ALSO NOTE THAT THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"great place for after dinner! great variety of desserts, not too expensive for the portion sizes. tried the taro shaved ice, matcha egg waffle and marshmallow toast. nice presentation, and the desserts weren't overly sweet, which i liked. one thing though, there's always a wait for seats -- so be expected to not be able to get a seat immediately, especially if you're in a large group. but generally, a place worth going!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times. I have to say I have been to many Asian desert places. This place is way better than their Spadina location, but I still have to say I have had better Asian deserts elsewhere. The location is convenient as it is in North York walking distance to the TTC subway station. I think it is also the only Asian desert place in the area. The seating is very tight I find and not very comfortable, especially if you was in a group. The deserts quality is average. I find it too sweet for my taste buds though. Overall, this place is average."}
{"text":"I absolutely love love this place for so so many reasons!!  Numba uno, this place is great for snacks both sweet and savory.They have a long list of items in their overwhelming menu to pick from but in my case I refuse to experiment here I love my basics which are the popcorn chicken, lobster balls, wings and their mango tapioca dessert.The popcorn chicken is fried pieces of dark meat(which I'm not too fond of) chicken topped with their special mayo, tuna dried flakes and dried seaweed with another sauce absolutely  delish!  Secondly this place is very reasonably priced and on  average when I order a 3 apps and a desert my total generally is around $30.  I have to mention their service even on a busy night which is normally every night is fast and the food is piping hot.Ambience wise I'm not a big fan of this place and therefore 4 stars..this place has bright lighting and tables are placed too close to one another.  There is plenty of parking out there in the shared parking lot.I do recommend this place for these reasons and I believe it's open till 2am on weekends which is an added bonus."}
{"text":"came here many times and it's an awesome dessert place. the dessert isn't the best I've ever had but I will still come if I'm craving dessert. I have tried a lot of items but usually I get the mango sago or coconut milk sagos and they have good toppings such as lychee popping boba, tapioca, grass jelly and ice cream the shaved ice is also good and I tried the mango one and green tea before and shared it with 3 people and it was a good amount. it also includes a lot of toppings  pricing is around $5-$10"}
{"text":"This is a solid 3.5/5 star review.  I was in the hood so I wanted to check out Sugar Marmalade through my YEA.  Tried both the green tea shaved ice and the mango black pearl.  I enjoyed the green tea shaved ice much more.  It was a mild sweetness of the green tea shaved ice with the sweetened red bean topping along with the warm diluted condensed milk that you can drizzle on top to your liking.  Would highly recommend that you share the shaved ice dessert as I think the portion size is quite generous for one person.  The mango black pearl dessert was good and as it promised, it was heavy with the mango pulp/juice as the base with chunks of ripe mango floating within  The cafe looks very clean and modern with lots dessert-related phrases on the walls that lend it a cozy and jovial atmosphere that is all about desserts.  Their menu is expansive and covers all manner of Asian-style desserts.  The service was a little slow but it could be that it takes time to put together that shaved ice dessert.  Best to go in there with some patience."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. They even have those asian buttons to press for service on the tables. We didn't even need to use them, as there was always someone around to attend us. Our waters were filled constantly, and the waiters were polite and attentive.  Came for a late night dessert. I got the marshmallow toast ($5 something before tax & tip), and I don't even like marshmallows but I wanted sweet toast, ha. It took longer than the other desserts to come out, but it was quite yummy! Not as toasted looking as the picture but it was crispy, crunchy, warm and gooey nonetheless! I was pleasantly surprised :)   The chocolate shaved ice is also really good. The ice cream is sweeter than the shaved ice cream, and has some oreo chunks in it. I recommend sharing the ice cream dishes with a friend.  The place is nicely decorated with modern \"chalk\" drawings and ceiling lights. Heads up, CASH only!"}
{"text":"The place is really small but semi comfortable. The customer service is alright, but I would say that they get pretty overwhelmed by the amount of customers they get so they should put more people on shift. The variety of food is great, with a twist on some ordinary food like their takoyaki or kimchi fries. The dessert taste just as good as any ordinary Chinese dessert with a bit more options and toppings. The size of the food and drinks are worth the price as you do get a decent size for an average price. Overall I would say that it's a great place to hangout with friends but not in large groups because the place is small. Going there on the weekends may also mean a lot of waiting."}
{"text":"This place is always busy.  Despite of that fact, they have a good buzzer system on their tables when you need service or the bill.  Service is good. They only take cash or debit.  All the food we tried are good.  We ordered a mango drink but can't remember the name now that was really good.  There are still a lot of things on the menu we want to try so we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this dessert place fore few times already. They have Chinese traditional style of dessert but they also add some new stuff like yogurt bubbles and ice cream into it. They give you a lot and basically it's like a meal. I suggest you do not eat to full before you come to eat dessert. They also have durian dessert series, if you are a durian lovers, you really should come to try it. They give you a lot of durian and it testes really good.  But the reason I only give four stars is that the music is way too loud! I barely can hear what my boyfriend was trying to say to me all the time.  I would say it's a good place for fusion Chinese traditional dessert, but I really hope the music is not that loud."}
{"text":"We ordered the salt and pepper chicken which was pretty standard but it had a lot of little bones.  The beef noodles was alright as well.  Considering this place is supposed to be known for desserts, it wasn't very good.  We got the golden sago w/ sweet coconut noodles.  We were hoping that it would be like the place near us (Dessert Kitchen) and it wasn't.  The coconut noodles were... hard?  dried?  I don't know how to describe them.  They are cut wider than Dessert Kitchen's which would've been fine except for their texture.  They should be soft, yet chewy with that fun-in-your-mouth goodness.  These were not unfortunately and the soup was a thick, mango-y mess that coats your throat.  Definitely too sweet. As for the bubble tea, I got the brown sugar milk tea, 1/2 sweet.  It was SUPER sweet.  I can't imagine what full sugar would taste like.  There was also very little tea flavour.  Perhaps some of the other menu items are better?  I'm not sure if I'll chance it."}
{"text":"Huh. I seriously thought I wrote a one-star review for this location based on my first visit here, which left me rather upset. That time, my three friends and I ordered. They received their orders. Mine didn't show up, so I asked after it when my friends were mostly done their food. There was a blank look on the waitress's face, so I was pretty sure she didn't put my order in. She said she'd go check on it. She came back to tell me they were making it. I asked her if they just started. She said yes. I told her to cancel my order. She gave me a dirty look. Why would I want to wait for my food if my friends are done eating and they're the ones that messed up? When she brought the bill over for my friends, she finally apologized. Not cool at all.  That being said, my two visits after that one were alright. The desserts look like the pictures. Very much so. They're also not expensive. The durian is fresh. The ginger boiled milk has a strong ginger smell. The matcha mein mein is not super strong on the matcha, but it's alright, and it's not too sweet. The pomelo with mango sweet soup and coconut noodles is interesting. It's not the best mango pomelo sweet soup I've had, but it's pretty good. The portions are also quite good for price.   Service still isn't the best as it's rather slow, but the food's good, so I'll probably be back. They're usually very busy though."}
{"text":"Everything here is affordable and not too expensive! It is great for a gathering  my friends and I came at around 12pm and it wasn't too busy. We decided to get 3 salties and 1 sweet dish.  The popcorn chicken was the BEST for us! It tastes like the Hot Star chicken but with Japanese teriyaki and mayo. The fries were just like regular fries but with teriyaki and a fishy taste to it. The rice dish was filled with black pepper and it was also a bit spicy. The pork tastes just like the meat in the McDonalds junior chicken LOL   The Mille feuille was okay  it's basically just a puff pastry with mango chunks and mango sauce.   OVERALL, great place to hang out with your friends! Looking forward to come back again"}
{"text":"I must say, they have A LOT of selection for desserts..I enjoyed every desserts I had so far. The reason i'm rating this place 3 stars is because of their slow service... we were done eating and waiting for them to clean the table, the lady looked at our table and just passed by. We had to raise our hands and let them know that we were done. We came around 5:30 on a tuesday, and there werent many people.  On the other side, their desserts are fullfilling and satisfying. Well presented. Will come back again if I chitchat with some friends and got time to spare."}
{"text":"Came in with my boyfriend around 1pm and the place was empty. I thought that meant my order would come faster (or at least in a decent time). The prices here are reasonable. $5 - $10 per dessert. The food menu is a bit overpriced in my opinion. $8 for 5 wings? No thank you.   The first time we came my boyfriend ordered the B5.  ?????? - Golden Mango Pudding, and I got the Traditional Egg Waffle with chocolate ice cream (they were out of vanilla).  The mango pudding came out after about 20 minutes. We were told the egg waffle would come in 15 minutes but an hour later we found out they never made it because they were out of vanilla ice cream. That was really disappointing.   The presentation was great though. Everything here always looks really cute and nice. The actual taste of everything was pretty pleasant and nice. The egg waffle was a bit too crumbly from being over cooked, but it was delicious when it finally came."}
{"text":"Sugar marmalade has opened up in First Markham Place close to Ding Tai Fung and Sonoya. Thank goodness for another Chinese-Taiwanese snack and dessert place for more variety in this already busy mecca of Asian eateries. The space seats about 45-48 patrons. Bright graphics adorn the murals backing the bench seating. Service was attentive.  Hubby and I ordered entrees of stewed beef on rice as well as Japanese style curry pork chop on rice. Entrees are very reasonably priced between $7.50 to $10.50 and generous portions they give you are shareable if you don't have a big appetite and particularly if you're planning on ordering dessert. The entrees were served with Chinese greens and a tea egg.   We also ordered the golden mixed sago and got the green tea egg waffle but requested black sesame ice cream with it . The golden mixed  sago was mango-ey, creamy, light, and delicious. The perfect light summer dessert. The green tea egg waffle was soft, chewy yet with a very mild green tea flavour. The red beans made this dessert overly sweet for my taste but I appreciated the neutralizing taste and texture of the glutinous rice balls. I was disappointed with the ice cream, which tasted like Asian grocery store style black sesame ice cream which lacked density and the chew of what I look for in good ice cream.  From July 22-31, 2016, you can get 30% off by liking and checking in at Sugar Marmalade on Facebook, OR tagging them on Instagram on a picture of your fave dessert @sugarmarmalade. Oh, and if you get cold easily like me, bring a sweater as their A/C is working too well. 3.25 stars."}
{"text":"Kind of disappointing on my 2nd visit here.  I was introduced to this location about an year ago and very much enjoyed it the last time I was here with some desserts (some bubble tea).  This time though, it was lackluster with Taiwanese food that I've had better elsewhere but the selection is good and worth a try if you don't have much in the area.  Food: 2/5, the desserts are better than the food.  We got bunch of appetizers and mains (fish balls, squid, wings,) but the dishes are very bland.  For desserts, go for the bowl desserts rather than the drinks as the pictures are similar only for the bowls and the rest don't look that great when you get it.  Service: 3/5, they are nice and fast   Ambiance: 3/5, it could get loud but nice decor and seating and nothing to complain about  Price: 2/5, it's a bit pricey compared to other Asian dessert places and with food/deserts, about $20+ per person"}
{"text":"Place looks nice but the food....  I got a strawberry apple soda and my friend got a strawberry lime soda. In the menu it says that it's \"FRESH\" strawberry apple Italian soda & \"FRESH\" strawberry & Lime Italian soda.. what happened to the \"FRESH STRAWBERRY\" how did that turn to \"strawberry jam\"??!!! In my strawberry sod I only had 1 piece of preservative strawberry!!!   Their egg waffle looked good but friends said it looked smaller this time. In their picture their mango for the black sesame waffle filled 2/3 of the waffle this time it didn't. You can barely see the mango from the whip cream. Their were kind enough to change out the banana to strawberries for the chocolate waffle.  This comes back to my drink, if they have strawberries why didn't me and my friend get any in our \"FRESH STRAWBERRY\" drinks!!! My other friend got their durian beverage and guess what  no durian! Smells like durian but why have a piece of durian in your picture when there aren't gonna be any... Don't do any false advertisements if you can't give what you tell your customers!  Lastly their beverage made me have a stomach ache...  terrible experience!! So do they even deserve this STAR... you tell me!"}
{"text":"One of my worse experience so far, tonight our waitress totally ignore us from the moment we walk in, had to ask for menu and water. Then she brought us 3 cups of water for 8 ppl. When ask for more water, she told us because we close at midnight, but not according? the sign, which close at 1. All while the couple that came after us, got seated, had menu and water before us. What a bad customer service experience."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible service. Came back expecting an upgrade in service... sat down, ordered, turns out they didn't have the golden sago with coconut noodles so I settled for a mango pancake.  Two tables filled up beside us and the one near the door. 10 minutes pass.. 20 minutes... we ask where our food is- the table next to us got their popcorn chicken already. Surely it takes longer to make that than a pancake?? The server goes and checks the computer and looks confused.. apparently the guy didn't put in the order because it wasn't there at all. They don't say anything until 5 minutes later, one of them comes and mumbles something like 'umm in back getting blahblah something' ... yeah it was so unclear and we didn't ask him to repeat because he rushed off after that. It's not like they're understaffed either. Nor is the restaurant full..  After another 10 minutes, I get up to leave because it is ridiculous how a table of 8 got their orders of snow ice, pancakes and appetizers before we've even been served a bit. Horrible.  Will NEVER return here. Every time I go, the server forgets our order and a few minutes later, a few of them start putting on their jackets to go outside or something. I have no idea what's going on."}
{"text":"Was caught between and rock and a hard place when I noticed this while walking from the bank to chatime because on the 1 hand the reviews on yelp weren't that great but I love Taiwanese desserts and snacks.   So after walking all the way to chatime I made my dining companion turn around and head back lol we were lucky to get the last available seats in the restaurant. There's not a lot of space between the tables and people are definitely a bit squished and the table of overly excitable friends kind of got annoying after 2 seconds.  After first looking at the menu I just couldn't decide... not just in which dessert but which page to look at haha so many creative choices you just don't find in Mississauga.   After seeing the Korean style service bell my friend was just itching to press it... he waited until we selected our orders (taiwanese popcorn chicken and mango mixed black grass jelly) to press it. Tada.... nothing... okay... the bell was loud enough we could hear it ourselves... didn't understand what system they have for responding to each table but we pushed it 2 mins later again to no response... not even a bat of an eye. At this point two tables over, a staff was slowly clearing the table. My friend pressed it 1 more time and finally with no response I relented to the Canadian way and tried to flag someone down. It still took 4 tries with people walking dead ahead with no service in mind.   For 14 tabled with 6 staff members serving in the front of house it was definitely disappointing. My friend works part time on a boat and there's 6 of them serving 500 guests... so hard for him to stomach.  The chicken flavoring was similar and less flavorful version of Taiwan ' s. .. but much more rubbery and with a thai chili dipping sauce... not crispy at all. The size was more like chicken nuggets.   The mango grass jelly was more sago than grass jelly... it looked nothing like the picture and definitely lacked ingredients. Some of the sago were in clumps and it was very watery...  I actually forgot there was grapefruit in it til the end when there was a single piece sticking up.  In a city like mississauga where this type of dessert place is non existent it would be pretty exciting but to survive I think the quality has to match the creativity if not the service would have definitely help. One wauter moved very quickly on trying to remove my unfinished mango dessert and the  apologizing when i let him know im not done even though there was still pudding in there and our chicken was still half full. A lot of mixes, cans and pre cooked food. They have some redeeming features: fresh lemon water, fun t-shirts and mason jar drinks.   Might be back to try their hot desserts but I have a feeling Markham might be worth the journey. Poor introduction of my friend to a country's cuisine that I absolutely love."}
{"text":"I've been to the Yonge and finch location multiple times, this was my first time here at this location.  The service was okay, nothing bad or amazing.  What really is bad is the food. I would give this place a 0 on the food. It was one of the worst meals me and my two friends had.  I ordered the golden macuc pudding, my boyfriend got popcorn chicken, and my friend got mango sago with glass jelly.  The pudding tasted like whipped cream and crumb cookies... that's it, the cream wasn't even super sweet but it just whipped cream.  The mango sago had small chucks of real mango but the soup was like water and mango flavour powder..  Lastly the popcorn chicken was overly battered, not fried long enough sad pieces of chicken.   I don't remember the Yonge and finch location having this bad of food. So I'm not sure if it's the chef at this location. Overall not good, but they're opened later than some restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! I went for dessert at around 9:30pm on a Tuesday night.  I was seated at a table pretty quickly however, the waitress decided to say hi to her friend who walked in after me before seating me. It took around 10 minutes for the waitress to finally realize she hadn't given us a menu. She even the gave the couple who walked in a full 10 minutes after me a menu before she got around to giving me one.  She was constantly on her phone and waving her down to order took too long.  We tried using the call button on the table but that didn't work either. When I finally got her attention she said \" Oh, you don't have a paper?\" and went back to grab a piece of paper and pen for us to write our order on. By that point, she should've just taken down our order.   Durian Mille Feuille ($10.99) They give you real durian which is super great! I thought it would just be a durian flavoured custard. The part that ruined it for me was the brown syrup that they give you. It's not exactly pancake or maple syrup. My boyfriend poured it all over his dessert and it was too sweet had a weird after taste.  We also ordered two mango desserts that we usually eat when we come to this place. I've been to the North York location too and the service was not as bad as this location."}
{"text":"There are few places which I am generally confused about and Sugar Marmalade is one of them.  It's a dessert, snack, and drink bar and all three are distinctive and awkward in their own right.  The positives are that the decor is nice and the staff are relatively friendly. It's a small and intimate space which might be a bad thing depending on who you ask (as it tends to get quite loud to the point where you have to shout to have a conversation with someone) and all the items on the menu are decently priced but that's where the positives really end.  First impressions aside, the menu although seemingly intuitive actually hides what a strange place this is. The dessert, as is expected of a dessert place, is decent. Regarding the mango pancake that was ordered, the fruit was fresh and sweet and overall well executed. The snack portion was not so well received. When we came upon the Bacon and Salmon Rillettes Brick Toast, it was something we decided to order to try if only because of the novelty. The disappontment that followed could be summed up as follows: if you don't know what salmon rillettes is, don't put it on your menu or at least don't name it as such. It was effectively bacon and smoked salmon cream cheese.  The drinks themselves were unimpressive. We ordered the oreo milk tea and taro milk, the latter being hot which arrived cold possibly due to how loud it was as previously mentioned. Both drinks were mediocre at best.  Even when we were finished and enjoying our conversation, the lights in the place would constantly flicker and dim to the point where we thought the goddamned Demogorgon was going to burst through the walls.  Interested to try other items on the menu but overall the first experience was lacklustre."}
{"text":"After all that's said and done, I think(?) I am a fan of this place. The pros and cons to this place have left me rather confused.  The review of this place have been really mixed: some raving reviews saying there is no better restaurant for your food, some saying that it is alright, and some cursing it and it's descendants for eons to come.  I wish this review could provide to you definitive advice for the establishment, but - just as many of the reviews before me - I am left torn.  I agree with a majority of the reviews seen here; I'll try to lay it out in a easy to determine format.  Pros: + The food here was really good. We ordered: Kimchi Fries and Taiwanese style deep fried chicken for appetizer,  brisket on rice and Taiwanese pork on rice for main, and the green tea + red bean shaved ice for dessert. The only downside to this was that my girlfriend's brisket came with a very small amount of meat.  Other than that, every order came copious amounts.  The Kimchi fries were amazing (wavy fries provided extra crisp, and spicy mayo made a delicious mix), the Taiwanese chicken had more than enough to be an entree. For both of us.  Our entrees were pretty good, save for the quantity issue. And the dessert was a fantastic new experience! If you've never had this, it's hard to explain.  I'd liken it to...a ice and tissue paper hybrid with a green tea flavour, and a sweet red bean topping.  I know that doesn't sound appealing, but you need to give it a try before you can judge! + The food is cheap.  We ordered 5 plates, and it came to about 40 bucks.  If we had ordered this at any other place (I'm looking at you green grotto), the total would probably have come closer to 70.  For the portion sizes, the amount of food we got was phenomenal.   Cons: - Small + popular does not make for a good mix. We were lucky enough to arrive as some tables were leaving, so we only had to wait for 5 minutes or so, but the crowd that arrived after us were waiting an upwards of 20 minutes for a table. The restaurant opened in a small plaza, with bad parking, and with limited room.  They've done what they can to open as many tables as possible, but the place is very tight. If the people sitting besides us weren't speaking Mandarin (or was it canto...I couldn't tell), we would've been able to partake in the conversations by whispering. - Service. It was busy, so I understand that the servers were spread thin, and also given that the place is relatively new, maybe they're still working out their kinks.  That said, we had to ask for our drinks, pressed the service button a couple of times and they never got to us.  Did not get any spoons for our desserts, had to push our dishes onto the dirty table beside us, and had to go up to the main desk to get my receipt.  Don't get me wrong, the servers were nice, but we probably only saw them a total of 2 times when we had called out for them maybe 5 times.   So that ultimately leaves me on the edge.  There are two big pros, and two (relatively) big cons. This place really did have some amazing food, and we'll definitely be back to try some of the other desserts/drinks/appetizers. I would've given this a 5/5, but the service really dampened the experience (though I realize it wasn't their fault).   After all that's said and done, I think this place is a 'must-try'.  Wait for the lineups, the food is worth it.  And who knows, maybe the restaurant will live up to it's name and you'll leave with a sweet experience."}
{"text":"There are a lot of varieties on their menu. It has Glutinous Rice Ball ??, Soy Bean Jelly ???, traditional sweet soup (e.g. ???) bubble tea & appetizers like Taiwanese popcorn chicken.   Our Orders: Steamed Egg White with Milk &Ginger (hot) ???? Mango Pomelo Sago with Glass Jelly  ?????? Black Glutinous Rice with Sweet Almond Soup (hot) ?????? Black Sesame Waffles with Green tea ice cream  ???????????  The Ginger steamed milk was a bit too runny and not gingery enough. Either the temperature of the milk was not accurate or they didn't use enough ginger juice, that's why it didn't set properly  The Mango Pomelo Sago was ok. I think that it wasn't cold enough and the mango chunks were a bit sour.   The Purple Sticky Rice with Almond Milk was really yummy. I will try the other dessert from the purple sticky rice series next time.   As for the black sesame waffles..i will just say..order it if you like soggy egg waffles    I think this place offers decent Chinese desserts..I just have to go back again and try to find a couple good staple items I can order.   The location is very convenient though. It is at the plaza next to the Chatime plaza. i want to try their popcorn chicken too (table next to me ordered that and it smelled good )   Oh man, bubble tea..popcorn chicken and dessert.. Is lucky(?) that I don't live in Mississauga or Toronto. So going to eat out every single day"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I set foot in a Sugar Marmalade and they have multiple locations in Toronto. Came here after hitting the gym (yes, the irony of it) and it wasn't too busy so we were able to get a table of 4 right away.   It does get busy here on Friday evenings and weekends. This location has probably been opened for about a year or so- quite small and not a whole lot of seating here. Service is pretty good- basically the staff standing behind the counter table can see everyone in the place and they have these buttons to call the staff if you require service.  For food, I got the Baked Chicken with Rice- pretty good and decent portion size. Wish the cheese was more baked in the rice as it should be so the flavours were there. Mango smoothie was good with lots of mango pieces but wish it was a bit more cold.   Overall, pretty good dessert place with a good selection of savoury foods, desserts and drinks! It is one of the very few dessert places that are opened later which is quite convenient."}
{"text":"Despite many poor reviews about the place, my friends and I decided to give Sugar Marmalade a chance because we were craving sweets and wanted to try a new dessert house - big mistake.  The breakdown:  Service - 1/5 Servers seemed unfamiliar with their own dishes/products on the menu; difficulty in communicating with the server due to language barrier (our server seemed to understand basic English and needed us to point out what we wanted from the menu); having to ask repeatedly for our side of rice even though most of our dishes came out already.  Food - 2/5 My friend and I ordered customized bubble teas (her drink was a brown sugar milk tea with bubbles, 50% sugar; mine was a oolong milk tea with bubbles and lychee jelly, 50% sugar) when we got our drinks, my friend had lychee jelly in hers; mine had nothing inside, just the oolong milk tea (both drinks were still very sweet). When we asked to correct our order, they brought the drinks back and just added bubbles in my friend's drink (but kept the jelly even though she didnt order them) and added my bubbles/jelly to it, meaning they didnt remake our drinks, just added some bubbles and ice, which watered it down; they didnt bother to make it less sweet either.  We got kimchi popcorn chicken even though we ordered japanese style popcorn chicken; the kimchi fries we ordered was the only correct and passable dish.  My friend got a braised beef noodle dish, where the meat was only fat and the noodles were overcooked.  Experience - 1/5 We didnt even want to have dessert after our meal, even though that is their specialty, it left such a bad taste in our mouth that we left immediately. I would not recommend Sugar Marmalade."}
{"text":"I happened to visit on a day when the mechanical system seemed to be down so the entire place smelled like a greasy diner. That being said, I do like the concept of an asian dessert place in Mississauga. I had the black sesame panna cotta and I tried the egg waffle with vanilla ice cream and strawberries. Everything was a little too sweet for my taste and the waffle was hard like it was sitting out for the entire day. Not the best dessert place but I'd be willing to try it again."}
{"text":"I've been to this place upwards of 20 times. It's a favourite among my group of friends. Usually a great place to just hang out, especially late at night.  The service is a hit or miss here. Sometimes you'll have your food out in 5 minutes, other times it can take nearly half an hour. It's what I've come to expect though and I don't come here if I'm in a rush. The desserts and drinks usually come out quickly, but the appetizers and entrees take more time.   Because of this, I'd recommend that you order your entrees and appetizers well ahead of your drinks/desserts (if you care about sequencing your meal). Whenever I order them together, my desserts always come first and I'd rather have it the other way around.   The menu at Sugar is pretty extensive. There are nearly 20 pages dedicated to just different types of drinks and desserts. The desserts are mostly composed of fresh fruits, jellies, and other Taiwanese ingredients (ie. don't come in expecting chocolate ice cream with caramel drizzle on a waffle). Most menu items can be ordered hot or cold, which is a nice option.   My personal favourites on the menu are as follows:  -Golden Royal Mango Drink (S1): this has pretty much a perfect rating across the board from whoever I recommend it to - just an amazing drink featuring mango juice, chunks, jellies, and more -Okonomiyaki fries: savoury offering with French Fries topped with seaweed, smoked bonito flakes, and a delicious sauce (made to taste like okonomiyaki, a traditional Japanese cabbage pancake dish) -Popcorn chicken: needs no explanation, served with sweet chili sauce -Pearl delight: a concoction of jellies and fruits served in a milky base  These are the items that I'd recommend to any first-timer - but there are many other options that I've liked as well. To be more specific, I'd trust most of the entrees/appetizers, and all of the desserts containing fruit/jellies. I'd personally stay away from the teas (Chatime is right next door!) and stick to their specialties - which are Taiwanese snacks and desserts.  Lastly, the prices are great! I believe the most expensive entree last I checked was $8.49 - and that's for a full meal. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I was hoping this new location would be better than the one at dragon city mall... the only improvement I saw was that the restaurant was less claustrophobic. The food and service was very underwhelming - they missed ingredients for the same menu items found in other locations. They also served dessert before entrees! Perhaps that's just what they do at this location and we could have asked but you would think this was common sense.   Most likely not returning for anything other than fish cakes and dessert, even though dessert wasn't mind-blowingly spectacular either, just decent."}
{"text":"I decided to go on a Friday after seeing they had just introduced egg waffles on their menu. There was a bit of a wait as expected on a Friday evening, but the strange thing was right at the front entrance of the restaurant was an old washing machine covered in a garbage bag... what?   Anyway I order the egg waffle (which is also promoted at the entrance on a poster as a new item) only to find out they're out. I'd be more understanding if it was a Sunday night, but they shouldn't be out of a promoted new item on the first night of the weekend.  I ordered the chocolate shaved ice instead. It's the first time I've tried shaved ice and turns out I don't like it! However, I don't think that's the fault of Sugar Marmalade at all - it tastes just like it's name (icy, not rich in taste) and the presentation was great.   My husband ordered an Italian soda and enjoyed it.   I may go back to try the egg waffle and will update my review then."}
{"text":"Great causal dessert place! I came here with some colleagues after dinner and before drinks so we didn't have much time. The service is prompt and you get your food very quickly. The restaurant is a little tight but so that's how they can maximize patrons. I had the special grass jelly mango sago and it was pretty good. Not too sweet and very strong mango taste throughout. The only thing is I thought it would be more grass jelly and less sago so maybe I will double check my order next time. Its very affordable, our three orders were less than $20. Sugar marmalade has become a staple in Chinese desserts so they sort of lost the wow factor. Hopefully they are able to come out with something to attract new customers soon!"}
{"text":"Location Nice, modern decor and setup. Like the ambiance, music, mood lighting. Seats around 40-50 people.   Service  Free wifi. Friendly and attentive servers. However, they only take debit and cash.   Food We ordered:  +++ durian mochi (soft, chewy and oh so good!) ++ Taiwanese popcorn chicken (addictive, but a little salty) + mango sago with grapefruit (slightly watered down, although I like that it wasn't too sweet)  Overall, it's a good hangout spot. We came in the afternoon so it wasn't too busy, but it's a different story at night."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were craving something sweet on the weekend so she suggested we stop at Sugar Marmalade for some desserts or snacks - it was a great decision.  Sugar Marmalade is a small, Asian desserts restaurant. I have never tried it before, but a Yelp search shows that it is part of a popular dessert restaurant chain.    Although the restaurant was fairly busy when we arrived, there were some tables available and we were quickly seated.  The decor at the restaurant is simple and clean and the seats are comfortable.  Even though the restaurant was small, Sugar Marmalade had a fairly large selection of foods, drinks and desserts.  After changing my mind several times, I ordered the cold mixed fruit sago and my girlfriend ordered the cold mango sago.  For those not familiar with Asian desserts, sago is the mini white pearl bubbles with coconut milk.  My dessert came in a big square bowl and it was delicious!  The serving was large and my bowl contained many variety of fruits (papaya, mango, pineapple and watermelon).  The sago was cool and smooth and eating those little white pearls makes me want to eat more.  My biggest regret is that I cleaned out my bowl before I remembered to take a photo.  Something of note is the servers at this place don't really pay much attention to you unless you waive them down.  We also communicated our orders to our server in Chinese.  They were able to provide us with efficient and friendly service, but I am uncertain about the quality of service for English speaking customers.    If you enjoy quality Chinese desserts, I would strongly recommend Sugar Marmalade.   4.1 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Ordered two desserts, they both came in a timely manner.  They weren't bad but nothing special. As for service it was a little slow but when we rang the bell on our table they came almost immediately.. So just ring the bell people!!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely winning for the best Asian dessert spot around. We were so lucky to get a table within a few minutes because it was packed (as it is every time I drive by). We really came for drinks and fries despite it being more a dessert place but after looking at the menu we had to try one of the sweet treats!  I got a drink that was like an Italian soda but reminiscent of a mojito with lots of crushed mint. Seriously it was so good I had a hard time not gulping it down in under 3 minutes.  We got the Kimchi fries which were good but not the best I have had. I felt like they were kind of soggy. Something happened with their fryer, they came and told us this. Then when the fries finally came out they were just not up to par, they really should have done something to compensate for the long wait and subpar fries. The dessert made up for the fries! We got marshmallow bread. Holy moly this thing came out looking just like the photo. It tastes as good as it looks too! It is both salty and sweet, I think we will have to come back for this specifically!"}
{"text":"Love this brand spanking new dessert cafe joint. Modern decor, parking at the rear, free wifi (password is 11 8's), somewhat small yet good selection of entrees, great lineup of standard snacks and some unique drink options.  Good service even on a busy saturday evening.  Good HK style rice noodles ($4.49) are piping hot and dredged with the peanut and hoisin mix. They are cut into bite sized pieces making for easy scarfing.   Unique drinks include Coconut herbal essence jelly special ($3.99) and flavoured (I got watermelon) ice coffee smoothie($4.49). Both awesome. lots of herbal jelly and you can taste the distinct flavours of both the fruit flavour and coffee flavour!  Tried the stewed brisket rice noodle. ($6.49) Nice and tender meat with thick string rice noodles.    Prices are reasonable.  Definitely recommend this joint even on packed saturday nights with steamed up windows."}
{"text":"The food was okay. Be aware of what you're ordering as alot of the dishes have the same taste/flavour. We tried the Japanese popcorn chicken, which was quite good. The takoyaki was also good, as were the Japanese Japanese. Again all were good but all 3 together were too much of the same flavour. The eel and cheese toast was interesting. Not bad but I'm not sure if it works all together. The black pepper chicken with cheese on top of rice was really underwhelming. It didn't go together and taste like it was a day old. Unfortunately the desserts were no better. We got the durian dumpings which was completely lacking in durian flavour but really any flavour resembling a dessert. The durian panna cotta was in no way like a real panna cotta. It was like watery, somewhat gelatinous milk with a tiny little spoon of durian. The black sesame ice cream was the only good part of the dessert but it was unfortunate that it was supposed to be a durian dessert. The only okay dessert was the mango shaved ice. Overall pricing is okay, each dish was about $7-11 or so. The dessert I found was a bit overpriced for the lack of flavour and lack of fruit. The server was very slow and uninterested, and seemed annoyed when I asked for a new fork and spoon as the one I got still had food residue on it or either they just gave used cutlery.  Probably would not be returning."}
{"text":"Spent a quiet Saturday afternoon out of the rain. I had the popcorn chicken rice, fish cake, house jelly mix, and papaya juice. Liked all the different textures in the house jelly. Food was well made and good portion. Prompt service, free parking shared with owl of Minerva next door. Definitely consider going back again."}
{"text":"If you are not familiar with Sugar Marmalade, it is a franchise specializes in Chinese/Taiwanese traditional desserts and some savoury snacks and drinks. This new location has better service and ambience compared to other ones. I can't tell which location serves the best quality food overall because I order different stuff every time.   My boyfriend and I came here during their grand-opening period where you discounts if you like their fb page or post a pic on instagram. I have to say the quality of food was good (nothing spectacular) and both of our desserts came out pretty quickly. One thing that stood out here was service. The waitress who was responsible for our table was so nice!! She was smiling the whole time and very polite. They have this button at each table/booth to call a waitress, but it wasn't working at that time.   Overall, it was a pleasant experience, pleasant enough that I had to add this new location on yelp so that they appear here too. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"First time here with my boyfriend after dinner at Owls next door. They have such a variety of desserts I wanted to try all of them! I ordered the Golden Treasures Mixed which was recommended by our waitress and my boyfriend got the Golden Macau Pudding. Both desserts were delicious and definitely satisfied my sweet tooth! Will come again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Food was good. The restaurant is very small, chairs are very loud when you move it. It's a good place to chat, give you a feeling that you are in somewhere in Hong Kong. They only accept cash, but there's an ATM right at the door. It's not good for a group of people, only good as a couple. I would recommend this place for a late night dessert tho."}
{"text":"Came here to chill with a couple of friends and my overall experience was good. I ordered Z36 which was essentially a chicken leg with rice and a vegetable side dish. I also ordered the Green Tea Parfait. I didn't particularly like the chicken dish. It was really salty and I didn't really like the aftertaste it left me LOOL. There was a point during the meal where I wanted to throw up. The Green Tea Parfait, however, was DELICIOUS. ITS REALLY GOOD AND I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT. ($5.99 though ; gotta live that broke life yall). It was layered like a lasagna. One layer of cereal. One layer of (sour-ass) strawberry slices. One layer of cream. One layer of cereal, one layer of strawberry slices, one layer of cream and finally it was topped with green tea ice cream.   Servers were okay. Some were a lil quiet. One girl kept on refilling people's cup which was cool. But would I come back? Sure why not, but only for the desserts though LOOL. I have come to realize that I'm just not really a huge fan of more taiwanese savoury dishes (other than the chicken leg dish at Ten Rens  ~ thats my bae and will forever be my bae -until i find another to replace it- :) )"}
{"text":"Sugar Marmalade Markham just opened at FMP and they are having an opening promotion till end of this month...30 % OFF if u check in on their fb page or if u tag them on IG.  Service:  excellent...everyone is prompt and courteous and helpful.  Your water cup is never empty.    Menu: lots of variety  Atmosphere: nice, hip and trendy..cute decor too"}
{"text":"Not bad for Chinese desserts, nothing amazing either. Highlight was the Taiwanese popcorn chicken! Pretty sweet, and generous portions."}
{"text":"I've been a few times and the desserts are amazing, especially the Mango Supreme!   But each time I've been, the service has been horrible. Each table has a button system which you would think is very simple. You click water, and they come with water, you click call, and they take your order. Instead, me and my friend clicked the button and got ignored each time. People that came after us were served earlier simply because they were seated near the front. We sat at a back booth and at occasions  the waitress saw us click the button and raise our hand but still turned around and ignored us.   Although the food was good  the service was so terrible that I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Loved the mango sago here! It was delicious! The mango sago had just the right enough of sweetness for me and had fresh chunks of mango.   I also tried the mango pancake but I wasn't a huge fan of it. Eating the mango pancake was basically eating spoonfuls of cream with an occasional piece of mango.   This place mainly focuses on dessert items but there are several non dessert items on the menu.   Service:  The food here comes quickly after you order it so that's good. What I didn't like is how the waiter kept walking by the table while I was still deciding what to order. It made me feel rushed. It's not like she had to write down our order or anything since we write it ourselves then hand it to her. She did not have to keep coming over. Indecisive me needs time and does not like feeling rushed. Also, our waters never got refilled. Our dishes, however, were taken away promptly after we finished.    I plan on coming back someday to try the other desserts."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant service I have ever had. We wait for 90minutes for our meals. And food tastes really salty and cold."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place. Ordered the durian panna cotta. Liked the real fruit, just not the Cheerios on top. Service was very slow. Even a bubble tea takes 20 minutes to get to our table. But overall, the food is okay, the atmosphere is great. Will go again in a splurge."}
{"text":"Very bad service.  We came here on a Friday night around 9pm. Not too busy. When we sat down the lady sitting next to us just found out her order was never put in and the waitress was scrambling to get the lady her order. We then put in our order: pudding platter, oolong milk tea and black sesame pana cotta. After about 15 minutes new customers came in and sat next to us. They ordered and got their food and we were still waiting.....the waitress were just standing there talking to each other and never thought odd that we have not received our order.  When I inquired she finally went to check. I watched her then put in my order and ran to the kitchen. When she came back I asked if she never put in our order, she got flustered and denied it even though I literally watched her put in the order after I asked.   Food finally came and she apologized with a 10% discount.   The tea has no taste and the pudding were fine (pretty hard to screw up). But the pana cotta, OMG, came in a take out container, Cheerios on top and some gluten concoction, but no actual pana cotta found.   I'm attaching a picture - see for yourself.   Drove from pretty far to come here - sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of this place.  Their mango desserts are yummy and I would say their cold desserts are the good items to order. I tried their hot almond with durian sweet dumpling and it is not the greatest.  The almond 'sweet soup' is watered down and lacks the flavour.  The sweet dumpling skin is not the same as the ones you have at other dessert joints and just not my liking. I enjoyed the durian filling though lol.    All the other times,  I have had their mango desserts and they are satisfying.  My friends ordered other fruit dessert like strawberry sago,  mango glutinous rice,  green tea shaved ice,  mixed fruit dessert and they enjoyed it as well.  I had their fried squid balls and beef noodle soup and it was yummy as well.   In terms of the interior,  it is new and modern and they have free WiFi (yay!). Signage and location is great- convenient and easy access.  Service wise they are decent,  I never had a bad experience.  Since the place is new and pretty busy,  the items maybe take a little longer but it isn't too bad. Give them a chance I'd say!"}
{"text":"Went here after eating at a near by ramen place and it was pretty quiet when we came in around 3-4pm. We were greeted by a nice waitress when we came in and there was no issues with the service for us. I can only assume when their busy that it gets really overwhelming and annoying for some people who try to get their orders in line with the staff.  Anyway, the desserts were good and descent. I don't have a favorite as of yet so anything you get here is what it is.   Fyi parents that there are high chairs available if you have a baby/toddler. Try not to bring a big stroller in because theres not much space to park in there.   The only thing I can say is to always try to come here on a down time to avoid any issues. Otherwise, its a nice dessert place"}
{"text":"When there last night for a second try.   Food: popcorn chicken was perfect seasoning and good portion. Durian pancake and G4 was my favourite!! Also tried the tofu dessert, in love with it. overall, food was 4.9/5 hahah  Service: had to wait in line for 15mins to be seated and service was kinda messy but considering a brand new restaurant I think it's acceptable and sure they will improve as time goes. Server was nice and friendly.   Place: the environment was nice, well decor. Background music is mostly Chinese songs which I enjoyed.  Overall I would recommend my frds and family to visit and try this newly open dessert place. One more thing is that they are doing promotion now. My bill was originally 50+dollars after discount after tax was less than 40!!!!!"}
{"text":"Feeling for dessert, we've always seen reviews for Sugar Marmalade, so it was about time we decided to come here. Located in First Markham Place, parking can be challenging depending on time of day.  As you walk in, the decor is contemporary and a big (Cash only) sign at the door upon entering. Overall place has a nice open concept with ample seating.  Sugar Marmalade offers a wide variety of things, whether here for a hot traditional Taiwanese, Chinese cuisines, hot/cold desserts or drinks, they've got it all.   I decided to try their black sesame ice cream with mango and crunch topped off with two strawberry POKE sticks.   Jen on the other hand had black sesame sweet dumplings in a warm ginger soup.  Overall great place, only bummer they except cash"}
{"text":"It was nice to see this franchise here as the last time I saw one was in Hong Kong. Service was fast and was nice to see those call buttons on the side of each table along with a wifi passcode. The only thing that made me wonder is why would I need a call button when everything was so close and tight being right next to the counter.   Overall the food ordered was fried fish cake and a mango crepe and a mango juice with coconut noodles and black tapioca. It was tasty but could of been a bit more satisfying. The feeling was a little lacklustre. Suffice to say the menu was too long and too much to choose from. I don't think I'll be back to this location."}
{"text":"This place has very nice desserts with good, affordable prices! I went with a group and enjoyed myself. I had the original egg waffle and the taiwanese popcorn chicken, both were delicious! The food came quickly as well. I would definitely come here again, maybe with family.   EDIT: nvm this place was sucky!!!!!! I came back and service was bad"}
{"text":"Desserts are good enough, but the rest is absolutely abysmal. Service is slow and terrible. Ordered a dish and they came back after 30min telling me it's not available. Utensils and napkins are literally dumped onto the table and you have to set it yourself. Dishes are blend and ordinary, and they even managed to overcook the white rice somehow."}
{"text":"I have been to both the yonge and sheppard location and this one at first markham place. The yonge street one is way better. I came to the fmp location yesterday with my friends. I ordered the matcha cheesebread with black sesame icecream - big let down! The matcha cheesebread was not soft and creamy at all. It tasted like stale bread with cream. My friend ordered steamed ginger milk and she did not like it either. This may be a newly opened restaurant issue, so I will give them another try in a few months. Hopefully their quality then will be the same as their midtown location!"}
{"text":"I love chinese desserts, so I decided to check out Sugar Marmalade with friends when we were nearby.   We ordered: mango pancake golden treasure mixed Black sesame parfait Frost bite slush (taro)  Deepfried fishballs  The mango pancake and taro slush were quite good, but the rest of the food were underwhelming. Not bad but nothing to rave about either. Our server was a bit clueless - we told her we wanted to split the bill as soon as we sat down, and she was still confused about what to do after we finished eating and wanted to pay. This place is alright if you just want to hangout with friends or if you are in the area and wanted dessert, but I wouldn't travel far for it."}
{"text":"I've been to Sugar Marmalade twice now and each time it's been decent. I recommend the green tea taiwanese shaved ice, or the original egg waffle. The desserts will definitely satisfy any cravings you might have for something sweet, but I wouldn't say that the food here is phenomenal. Make sure you bring cash because they don't accept debit"}
{"text":"Went for late night dessert with my friends today and it was my first time trying this place. I had high expectations as I had heard from friends that this place served good dessert.   I ordered the Fresh Mango with Sago Mixed. The dessert itself was pretty good and I am generally not picky about food. The service, however, was horrendous.  It didn't take us long to get seated. However, we were not given menus and had to press the call button to receive them. After putting in our order, four of the five items we ordered came fairly quickly. We waited for a while longer for our last dish to come before we began eating. After about 15 minutes we decided to call a waiter to check on our dish and to get utensils for our popcorn chicken. However, we were ignored by ALL the waiters in the restaurant. We pressed the call button many times, waved our hands at the staff, and even shouted a few times. It finally took a customer waiting to be seated to notify a server that we were trying to get their attention. As well, it took another 10 minutes and multiple attempts at getting the server's attention to finally get our bill.  TL;DR: We spent about 1 hour 15 minutes in this restaurant. Servers had trouble understanding our English. The food was good, service was awful. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Disappointing and Dirty  Came here because I love desserts and durian. The Durian cup with black sesame was the only thing I enjoyed.  DO NOT ORDER anything that comes with puff pastry. It was difficult to eat and unenjoyable.  The desserts are okay and decent. I might have wanted to come back another time and try more if it was run better.  Looks like it is run by a bunch of young people who do not care about cleanliness or their customer experience.  Upon entry you will be greeted with a pile of dirty dishes on top of their bar ledge. (RIGHT IN YOUR FACE) It seems like this is nornal practice for them. Who manages this place? I wonder what their house looks like. Service is hit and miss. Just being there made me feel unhappy with the dark decor.    My mother was so happy she went with me and not her friends because she was the one who wanted to try it. It would have been embarssing for her if she had taken her friends.  Loss of face as she would call it."}
{"text":"Pictures on Yelp were tempting but the desserts that we got were watered down. Service was slow as well."}
{"text":"I have been at this restaurant for many times. It is a good place when you have a group of people hanging out or playing some card games. Based on my past experience, I would've given a four-star. However, the experience was ruined by one of the waiters on my last visit, and I could give a 1-star for this unexpected and rude service.   First of all, let me talk about the food we ordered. The taste and the quality are as good as usual. We had the Mango Roll Supreme, the Taiwanese Style Popcorn Chicken on Rice and the Dry Stirred Ramen with Chicken Cutlet & Ginger Onion Sauce. The taste of the mango roll is pretty regular, didn't impress me too much but the price is pretty reasonable. The Taiwanese style popcorn chicken rice is definitely my favourite even though I know the deep fried salty chicken isn't too healthy if I eat too much of it. This is my first time to order the dry stirred ramen with chicken. The sauce is very special. The taste is very light, but the mix of ginger and onion is good enough to entertain my appetite. Hopefully, the portion of the ramen dish could be added more since it was not adequate amount for an individual if you considered that is your main entree for the meal.  As mentioned at the beginning, the customer service was unexpected to be bad like that. The waiter A served us drinks at first. After a roughly half-an-hour chat with my friend, the drinks were long gone. No one came to refill the water. We asked one of the waitresses to give us a water kettle so we could serve ourselves. After we re-filled by our own, the waiter A came to our table. He asked us if we need to refill the water. We explained to him that we just did ourselves, and would like to keep the kettle for later. He used a dismissive tone and said, 'sorry, we don't provide the service', then took the kettle and left... I meant if they were short of the kettles, that would be fine if he asked nicely to have it back. However, it wasn't even busy at the time and I saw there were a few full kettles placed on the shelf. We tried to make servers' work easier, but this waiter did not just appreciate but was so rude with his attitude. After I saw him knocked over a glass of water while he was placing a plate in front of a customer, I bet he was having a bad day, or maybe he is always like that."}
{"text":"First thing I noticed when I walked in was the smell of durian. I personally don't mind it but I know some people can't stand it. Anyways, they have a lot of durian desserts so it is hard for them to prevent the smell. I came on a weekend and it was really busy so we had to wait a bit.   I was very impressed with their extensive menu, there were so many offerings so it was difficult in narrowing it down. I want to try so many of them. Me and a friend decided to go with one durian and one mango dessert. We ordered a mango sago dessert, and a durian pancake. We loved the mango dessert, there was a strong mango flavor. The durian pancake was great as well. The pancake wasn't too thick which I liked. However, there weren't a lot of durian in the pancake. There was a lot of whipped cream though, in fact way too much whipped cream. The pancake was good but I wished there was more durian in it.   I would come back after having dinner in the area. There are so many other items I am interested in."}
{"text":"A unique bubble tea/desert experience, I visited here twice in the same week with friends. The variety is very good, considering many of the items they offer (shaved ice, glutinous rice) are not offered at other tea places in Sauga. I definitely recommend the green tea shaved ice w/ red bean; great texture and better than mango. Also got the House Special Jelly Mixed - didn't particularly enjoy it (too sweet, almost soup) but lots of new ingredients to try.   NOTE: Lines are normally super long between 8-10, our group waited about 45 minutes to be seated (3 people). Alternatively, we didn't wait at all when we went at 10:30pm."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this place.  We were already expecting this place to be the typical bubble tea / snack spot...   but jeez.. the service  First of all, if you have been to other places like this, you already know what to expect... lots of salty food, MSG, high sodium, etc. to get us to buy drinks.  Sure enough, we were right.  We got the popcorn chicken, squid balls, and lobster balls.  The squid and lobster balls were typical, very dry (so we sauced it up) and hot so make sure they cool down or you will burn your mouth.  The popcorn chicken was delicious... but the sauces and all the toppings made it really... savoury... so we washed it down with water.   We got a green tea waffle with red bean and it was ok.  Nothing mind-blowing  Funny thing is that the servers didn't even offer us water.  We had to ask for it halfway and then they didn't even refill it.  Something as simple as giving water should be a no brainer, I don't care if its tap water, service shouldn't be rocket science!  The Chinese immigrants already have a reputation for giving bad service.  Whether its because they are young, prefer to speak with their own, don't care, or just rich and spoiled...   The ramen place next door has way better service so Sugar Marmalade should learn from this.      Look, I know the young kids who go to University or just live in the area will keep going here because they are bored and/or don't know better, but they really have to pick up on the service.  Even if the food is absolute garbage, service goes a long way.  Don't support businesses who don't know how to serve customers.    Presentation 5/10 Taste 4/10 Price 6/10 service 2/10  Hopefully this helps."}
{"text":"The reason for the low amount of stars is because this place sits among a huge plaza of alternative dessert places, which are all better than this one.   The staff doesn't really care about their customers (pretty sure the staff are temp workers like university students). To order you will write on a piece of paper, which they give back to you if you want to order more. None of this is explained of course, so we had some confusion trying to get another paper (to place another order) but were continuously ignored.  Taste of the food is actually strange. I'm not sure if they also employ inexperienced students in the kitchen? (I've been told by my friend who worked in a similar dessert shop that everything hot is microwaved except deep fried items). The dessert is presented nicely but the taste is pretty bad. I think they tried to make their own whipped cream? It definitely did not come out right. Had a sort of grainy texture and was oddly sweet. The waffle was pretty bland, nothing special.  I think for the price and so many similar shops in the area, they would care more about their customers and foods. But at least it looks great for Instagram. I think you can enjoy this place by ordering something safe like ice cream or fried chicken, and staying to chat with friends. Other than that, move on to any of the other shops a mere minute away. The plaza is full of better places to try."}
{"text":"Horrible. Food is average but service is absolutely terrible and not worth the wait. We ordered this green tea shaved ice and they waited for 20 mins before they started making it which is when they found out they ran out. We wasted so much time and didn't get to eat anything. Horrible horrible service, the waitresses seemed tired and impatient. Do not come here unless you want to yell at someone."}
{"text":"This place is not good. I'm not sure where they're getting their good reviews from.  Their traditional chinese soups taste powdery and watery, and are not hot and fresh. Like others have mentioned they nuke it in the microwave and serve luke warm.  I went here on a whim and ordered the mango pancake. When I took the first bite the ice cream had an off-taste to it. I tasted only the mango syrup used  to decorate the pancake and it was rancid and tasted like fruit juice that had gone bad. I let the staff know, they took it back, tasted the syrup made a face and went to check the date on the bottle.  They brought back the menu and i ordered the \"dream sundae\" which was supposed to be strawberries, bananas, vanilla ice cream with red bean and cereal. When i got it, there was no cereal on it and there was this nasty brown jelly crap all over the sundae. I was already frustrated with my first choice being rancid, and now i'm even more frustrated that what i ordered did not match the description. I picked out the nasty jelly and finished my sundae and wanted to get out of there as soon as i can.  when we went to pay the bill the staff just wrote down $13 on the bill. we paid not thinking twice gave them a 10% only tip on top of that.  Afterwards i was thinking how could the bill come to $13 when we ordered 2 things  dream sundae 3.99 house special mango black grass jelly 6.49  Total plus tax should be 11.84. turns out they took the liberty of adding on their own 10% tip on top of that to bring the total up to $13.00.   Make sure you check your bill and ask for a breakdown when you pay. They didn't deserve a 10% tip let alone tricking us into tipping them 20%.   Just to be clear, it's not about the money - i could care less about the extra 2 dollars. It's about the principle, and essentially cheating your customers.   For quality chinese desserts, go to Tracy's at FMP. Anywhere but here."}
{"text":"This place was just across the street from the restaurant that I had dinner at so my friends and I decided to venture across the street for some dessert.  The decor here was simple and very standard. Nothing fancy and the service was ok.  My friends and I ordered, #41 (taro, sago, pearl delight), durian sago, fresh mango sago and #19 (the house special black grass jelly mix).   I had the #41 with the taro, sago and the pearl delight. This one was very creamy and delicious. I loved the little pearl delight balls. They remind me of my grandma's version but with a little bit of a herbal kick to them.  Overall, this place is a cool place to chill and kick back with some friends during late nights. I've had Sugar Marmalade before but damn, everything on their menu sounds super tasty and irresistible. It will definitely take me a few more trips to really get a good sample of their menu but check this place out for some yummy Taiwanese desserts!"}
{"text":"Nice, new local Taiwanese/HK style desserts. Still in its early stages, a tad slow service and disorganized seating when it's busy. We ordered the Golden Mango Mixed Sago and the Papaya Fungus dessert. Nothing special but look forward to trying their meals and snacks next time."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for dessert! I've been to this location a couple of times now and have always enjoyed it. During the most recent visit, I came with a larger group (13 people) and although it was a bit funny when I told them I needed a table for 13 at 8pm (busy time) they were quite accommodating.    I usually try to order something different each time so that I'd be able to try something new. I got D5...forgot what the actual name for it, but I think it was a fruit supreme of some sort (someone please check the name of it on the menu haha). There was SO MANY FRUITSSSSS and they were quite generous with it. It was topped with strawberries, honeydew, papaya, watermelon, mangos, aloe vera, small tapioca balls, basil seed, and a scoop of ice cream. The sauce was supposedly made of their special house sauce with aloe vera sauce but to be honest it just tasted like coconut milk (not of fan of it) so that was the only downside to it.   Overall, I really enjoyed it and would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"While im waiting for my shaved ice, let me write this review. It's been an hour that i stepped into the restaurant, been sitting at this table and just observing the work flow. There is only one waitress doing all the serving, taking orders, cleaning of tables while one is at the cash. My friends are almost done with their food and still just a glass of water in front of me. I understand they look really busy but i think they really need more staffs. Good luck sugar marmalade, i'm not coming again!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Awkward service, very sweet desserts, and some of them even having a chemical taste to it."}
{"text":"Came here after dinner with a bunch of my girlfriends. Was kind of disappointed with the desserts. They were creatively interesting in the menu. But when presented in front of us, it was totally different...  We each ordered different ones. The one I had was suppose to be dessert noodles in a shape of a roae. It just came as a spundle of noodles..lol..and the tapioca was undercooked, you can see the white parts in the middle of the balls. It also lacked flavour.  Also tried the durian cheesecake. That was ok. Nice rich durian flavour and smooth consistency."}
{"text":"Relatively new business enjoying a wave of interest and popularity, particularly among the local student crowd. You can expect to wait in a line that stretches out the door.  The menu is thick and extensive, they serve many Taiwanese deserts in multiple variations/flavors, along with a menu of savory entrees. Our group of seven diners sampled gelatin, and shaved ice in various flavors and fruit pairings. I ordered the pop-corn fried chicken with rice, and a taro smoothie, for myself. Everything was tasty and delicious.  On the downside, as other reviews have mentioned, the service was disorganized, but not unfriendly. They did however, forget two of our orders. We ended up leaving without the missing items. Hopefully, they will work out the kinks in service, given more time."}
{"text":"First off. A couple words of warning. This place is a desert-first place. Of you decide to order any food or snacks, know that deserts are served first before your meal will come. So order accordingly. Regarding the food, it's just average at best. I would not come here regularly for food. The service also leaves much to be desired. Is a new place and it gets fairly busy. I think the staff is still learning the ropes.  Now to the goods. The desserts here (at least every time I've been here) has been excellent. No real complaints in this department. After all, you come here for dessert, and this place delivers. Nothing is overly sweet, which for me is bonus points. Of this place only served deserts I would give it 5 stars. Because it tries to serve food as well, I have to knock it down a peg.  Also, they only accept debit or cash."}
{"text":"Love Chinese desserts and this place did not disappoint! Had the mango sago and well worth the money. Loads and loads of delicious mango on top of a bed of sago pearls.   I only gave a four star Bc I went back to try the lunch and let's just say I'll stick to having dessert here. Wasn't horrible but I'll do lunch somewhere else."}
{"text":"I came here on their opening day and they were really busy.  The orders came out relatively quick and the amount of mango in my mango drink was surprisingly a lot.  I'm comparing to the portions that NYC dessert places usually give and it generally isn't as modest as this place.    I came back on the 2nd day of their opening and everything was running fairly smoothly.  Orders also came out relatively quick while dining in.  As we were sitting there a long line formed for takeout orders and the staff here handled it well.    All the drinks and desserts were tasty, the staff were efficient.  Next time I'm in the area, I'll return for a drink or two."}
{"text":"Came here with some friend nothing special. The s1 drink and the mango desserts taste the same(I know that are based on mango, but I was hoping maybe little sweeter or different).  The teriyaki French fries are awesome."}
{"text":"I guess it was a wrong decision to order dinner at a place known for its dessert. Ordered two japanese curry pork cutlet rice via ubereats. $10 each plus delivery plus tax.   First, I expect the pork cutlet to come on the side so that it won't get soggy. Second, I expect the sauce to be curry. Not curry flavored corn starch mix! So gross. The egg was so dark but it doesn't taste as strong. Wonder how long the egg has been sitting in the bland sauce. Potato was soooo soft and so was the little carrot. Rice was a bit too hard to my liking too. Overall it's such a pathetic pork cutlet rice. the $20 we spent is worth so much more at other restaurants that offer normal curry.   Btw the one star was for the pork itself which has good texture and thickness. Not the batter tho cuz it's all soggy."}
{"text":"I love taiwanese food and desserts.  I come here once in a while.  I love their chinese dessert soups and sweet brick toasts.  I like how the desserts here aren't too sweet, it is at the perfect level of sweetness.  Thus it is now one of my fav places to come for drinks (bubble tea, tea, slushies), desserts, snacks, or a heavier dinner.  All the super good food here is fried.  So fried chicken and fried porkchop taiwanese style.   If you want an all-in-one place with lunch, dinner, drinks (non-alcoholic), dessert this is your place!"}
{"text":"We came in for dessert after having dinner at a nearby restaurant., saw all the positive yelp reviews and decided to come in. We were seated immediately. Upon looking at the menu, we decided we wanted a bubble waffle like in the photo, but the menu description doesn't say things like 'banana\", \"strawberries\" (as shown in the photo) it just says chocolate waffle. In fact I noticed that a lot of the descriptions were pretty bare minimum and didn't really explain what it was very well so I decided to ask the waitress if this chocolate waffle listed here, will come with everything like in this picture such as the bananas, strawberries, etc. and her answer was \"I think so? - it depends on the chef today and his style.\" and as I looked at her with an even more confused look, she then said she'd go ask. 5 mins later, she came back and said yes. We ordered two of those and other desserts such as the mango rolled in coconut and a mango sago. We asked for water and she looked at us confused, and asked me three times \"what?\"  as if asking for water might be a surprise instead of ordering juice or bubble tea.    The mango rolled in the coconut wrap came out almost immediately, it was followed by the mango sago.  The wrap that the mango was rolled in broke almost immediately, the texture was similar to that of hard jello. It wasn't very good, but the mango was delicious so we ate it anyway.  The mango sago was average and tasted as expected. A bit watery but overall not bad.   We waited another 30 mins for the first waffle, then we waited another 20 mins for the next one (ACTUALLY TIMED). The worst part was that the first bubble waffle tasted near burnt, and the texture wasn't right, it was like a hard sponge. The second bubble waffle was not overcooked but the texture was still off - hard sponge like. The batter they used for the bubble waffle isn't good. It doesn't taste good, and when cooked it doesn't give the texture of what bubble waffles usually feel like. It was very disappointing.   The whole place also smells like durian when we walked in. Yes, they serve it here, but their ventilation system is very poor, so the smell circulates round and round, I wasn't a big fan of this. I'd prefer not to be sitting in an aura of durian while we wait for the slow kitchen to prepare our desserts.   Overall, we were there for what felt like an eternity, was actually just under 2 hours, because we waited soo long for the bubble waffles, which weren't even worth the wait.  I do not recommend this place and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"-Lack of attentiveness  -Undercooked chicken -Poor customer service  Unorganized with many items not available. Food and drinks very underwhelming. Was served undercooked popcorn chicken. They were unapologetic and the manager had the audacity to charge for the raw chicken."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and it is still extremely disappointing. Service was okay but the food was so bad. Went in a group of 7 and we ordered a variety of things. Shaved ice was okay but the strawberries were sour. Original egg waffle was bland and the egg waffle was so hard it was almost burnt. Do not get the strawberry pancake with sundae supreme. It came with three strawberries and the crepe was filled with only cream. Sweet black sesame soup & sweet almond soup tastes like water but fortunately the server took it back and took it off our bill. Mango roll supreme, purple coco torpedo, and taro black glutinous rice with pearl delight were okay.  I would not recommend to come here."}
{"text":"For now I will give Sugar Marmalade only two stars... I ordered the pork cutlet and the meat was white in most areas but pink in some. I didn't complain, not sure why I didn't do it.. I'm not sure if I will go back"}
{"text":"Last night, I had 2 friends coming from the States to visit and we went to Han Ba Tang for dinner. Afterwards, my friend's gf said she wants some Chinese dessert. Since most of the places were closed at Yonge & Finch @1200am, we stumbled into this place for some Chinese dessert.  There was no opening hours sign on the front window and there still were people inside, so we decided to go in. A waitress came to us and we told them 3 people. I could see her face showing \"we are closing soon\", but another person (manager?) told her to take us in.  The temperature in the room was hot and we felt a bit uneasy. But in their defense, Toronto was cold the past few days and suddenly it was not as cold today. May be they didn't change the thermostat yet. But still, we weren't sitting comfortably. Cleanliness was fair. At least the tables and chairs were not sticky.  I ordered the mango grapefruit black sago (???? w/ ???). Sorry I know this is not its name, but that's the best description I got. When it came, I had to ask the waitress what that is, because it does not look like the photo at all. I understand that's the way restaurants works. Just like McDonald's. But if you were me, you'd be asking it too. Coz it really look nothing like the photo. On the photo, there was the mango soup base with black sagos surrounded by some black evaporated milk, plus mangos and grapefruits on top. The one I received was just mango soup with white sago. Where are the mangos and grapefruits? Turned out they (small portions) were all sunk at the bottom. Where's the black condense milk? Iunno. But I don't wanna cause a scene in front of my US friends so I just took it. The mango was so raw and hard. It sounds like eating celery, if you know what I mean.  My friend's gf ordered a mango grapefruit sago w/ grass jelly. But when the waitress brought it in, there was no grass jelly. She told the waitress about it and the waitress just took it away without apologizing. 5 seconds later, she came back with the dessert because they literally just dumped some grass jelly on. Again, I understand that's the way Chinese restaurant works. But if you are not re-making it, at least make the presentation decent.  The service doesn't make you feel comfortable and welcomed. I understand that the waitress may have worked long hours. And I understand it might not even be her fault making the wrong order; it's the kitchen's fault (if she didn't write the wrong order). But I am a nurse and I work long hours too. I never show my tired side to my patients and I never stop smiling to them. But this waitress has no smile and no apologies when the order was wrong.  I still tip her 15% because I understand she worked long hours. May be the store should be closed but the manager forced her to take us in. It is not her fault making the wrong order. It is not her fault when the kitchen simply dumped in the grass jelly on top without making it look decent at least.  Will I come back? No.  Hope you all understand my anger because I was hosting my friends from the States. As a host, I was embarrassed that I wasted their time trying this dessert place."}
{"text":"We had a family dinner here tonight. Service was excellent..the lady serving us was not only the prettiest asian gal I have seen, she was also very, nice, helpful and courteous that i was was tempted to ask if the joint was named after her..she was that sweet. The food was really reasonable and for us, a family of sweet tooth, was really yummy. We are definitely coming back again. We had the japanese popcorn chicken, crispy wings, mango pancake, beef brisket on rice, chicken curry, and dumpling soup. The dumpling soup was a bit disappointing, but everything else was delicious. The only thing i could have wished for, was for the place to have drinks...pop and beer are not available. They also only accept cash or debit. On the whole, a great find! Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"On the plus side - they have free wifi but you have to ask for it. The decor of the place is nice too. Regardless, the service and the food...   I ordered the hot fresh taro tea, and to be honest it wasn't bad - but I couldn't finish it. We also ordered the Bubble Waffles - the one with the chocolate and bananas. We were super excited to try it but unfortunately as soon as it arrived, it tasted like it has been sitting on the table for a while. It looked delicious, however the bubble waffles were super stale. The toppings were not fresh at all and the ice cream just made the waffles even colder. Overall, we couldn't finish it only because it just didn't taste good.   Also when the bill arrived, I didn't get my bill. Had to remind them but eventually it came."}
{"text":"The hostesses are very polite and nice. The drink there is nice But i think the dessert tastes better"}
{"text":"Decent for what it is. Ordered the shaved ice, not too bad... Overall nothing really special, but it's good enough."}
{"text":"First time went to Sugar Marmalade was impressed by the interior decoration. Once I glazed over the menu it was the typical asian dessert and fried snack place. I ordered the Japanese style popcorn chicken as I wanted to see what's different from the Taiwanese or rather the original popcorn chicken. Order took a bit of time although there weren't a lot of people during the time; there wasn't much of a difference between the original as they topped it off with a sauce, shredded seaweed, and bonito flakes but it was alright nothing really impressing. The environment is pretty warming where you can have long conversations with friends, but the seating arrangement of the place is pretty cramped. The pricing and portion of the food was decent, but wouldn't call it a authentic Taiwanese place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening as a group of four. The place was quite packed so we had to wait a bit. Their menu was quite large, full of different Chinese-Taiwanese desserts and snacks, so just deciding what to order was quite difficult. I ordered Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken for the group and a Black Sesame parfait for myself.  The chicken was ok. A little saltier than I would have liked and came with a sweet/spicy sauce. Not nearly the best I've had. The parfait came in a cute glass with two pocky sticks. The bottom layer was rice crispies which I found fun, followed by layers of yogurt and mango I think, topped with a nice scoop of black sesame ice cream.  This place also features a lot of durian desserts so if you're into it, give those a try. I'm told they were quite delicious and included a generous serving of actual durian."}
{"text":"You can almost missed it when you're driving. They are opened till pretty late at night. They are mostly packed at night. You have to wait in line aftee putting your name on a piece of paper they have.  Ice shaved green tea 4/5 taste quantity 2/5 The ice shaved green tea was very small in size. I took one before and it was loaded to the top like the taro ice shaved. Looks like they cut your portion down when they are too busy. Didn't like that part. And they won't do anything about it even if you're are a regular customer.   Taro ice shaved 2/5 The ice shaved didn't have any taste neither dairy nor taro taste. They hae glutinous rice balls in it. The orange and translucent balls ones. Only the ice cream had a taste.   Curry chicken 5/5   I just loved it. So tasty so well marinated. Was just on point. Not spicy.   Black pepper chicken cutlets 3/5 It was ok to eat. Was something different to try. But it is pretty dry to eat. They should have created a sauce to come with it. Too dry for my taste.  Mango parfait 3/5 Was ok to eat. Mango was not sweet at all. Very sour taste. The black sesame ice cream I love it. Earthy taste to it."}
{"text":"Stressed is just desserts spelt backwards!  This cafe serves modern revisions on old chinese classic snacks and sweets. There are plenty of choices to flip through, from hot to cold, fruity to nutty, or sweet to savory. Multiple drink options also, if you don't feel like eating.   Unlike western desserts (which comes in cake, pudding, ice cream, or a hybrid of the three), eastern desserts trend towards 'dessert soups'. A large portion of the dessert menu are various combinations of a soup base and the additions. The soup can be from coconut milk, fruit juice, beans, nuts or ginger. The additions are thrown in for substance, which can be fruit, jelly, sweet dumplings or various forms of starchy spheres. Some translation may be needed for those not use to the nomenclature. Like what is black pearl? sago? pearl delight? I think they are all spheres of different sizes and density. Be adventurous and do some exploring. If soups freak you out, there are always the traditional parfaits, puddings, and cheesecakes.  The space is small, with tables placed close to each other. It quickly gets crowded on Friday and weekends so be prepared to wait, especially if you come in a larger group."}
{"text":"I went to this location with a group of friends. They got an assortment of desserts; most tried the sago or glutinous rice, which were good (but not amazing). One friend got these little gelatin-like squares. I can't remember what they're called, but they bounce and shake when you move the plate.   As for myself, I ordered a green tea waffle. Firstly, it took forever for them to make it. They informed me that it would take around 15-20 minutes to make and I was okay with that. But it took them around 45 minutes in reality. All of my friends had finished their desserts already (except for my friend that got the gelatin squares who was kind enough to save one square so he could eat it at the same time as me... lol) and I had to go through the awkwardness of having everyone watch me eat the waffle while they had empty plates in front of them. Secondly, the waffle was not worth the wait. It was good, like the other desserts, but definitely not great, and DEFINITELY not worth the 45 minutes that I waited. If I'm being honest, my favourite part about it was the ice cream on top of it. And third, I asked the waitress attending to us two times during the 45 minutes when my waffle would be coming. She informed me that they were making it and it'd be ready soon, both times. I think she got irked, and I guess she told her coworkers, because when the time came for us to receive our bills, the guy that gave them to us threw them at us in a very rude manner. Let me add, I was not rude when I asked the waitress where my waffle was. I just wanted to know because I didn't want my friends waiting around for me.   Not a pleasant experience. I've been back since, and the other times the service was a bit better. I've also gotten the chocolate waffle which is better than the green tea one."}
{"text":"2.5 star for this place. We went here on a Saturday night and it was obviously packed but we didn't wait for too long. The service was good but it was so busy that they get too overwhelmed and end up forgetting you sometimes. We ordered the mango special drink with sago and a brain freeze apple deluxe, fish balls, and crunchy fried chicken.  My mango drink was really good but it was not cold at all! The brain freeze apple deluxe taste soon bland and only a slight hint of apple taste came through. They ran out of fish balls but they had a little bit left so they gave it to us on the house. The fried chicken was really crunchy but nothing special.  This place was ok, nothing special to be honest. I've been to better ones."}
{"text":"Ordered the honey dew shaved ice and one other sago like dessert. They were both tasty and were of a good portion size. The shaved ice is so filling I have no idea how anyone can finish it! The honey dew shaved ice had a really strong and good flavor to it. I think their desserts are generally good and the food here maybe not so much (but I cant say as I didnt order any food).  The service was spot on. Just tap the service call button and they quickly come serve you. They were fast and efficient and I think they deserve credit for that.  This dessert place is rather small with just a few booths. The rest are for couples to share. I had to wait in line when I arrived which is why I deducted one star. I would come again and try their other desserts. 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"After dinner we went into this place because the black facade is chic and the pictures of the desserts were enticing. The decor is nice inside, clean and pleasant, they also have the server call buttons at the tables; I wish every restaurant had that so you could get service when you wanted and didn't have to cry out in desperation after trying in vain to make eye contact with somebody, or endure the servers awkwardly hovering around your table unsure of when you might need something. We had the melon shaved ice which was enough for 3 people, the glutinous mango balls (pretty yummy) and a steamed papaya with egg and milk, which was just that - a steamed papaya with egg and milk. I was disappointed because I thought the papaya would be more desserty, sweeter and with something added but it was healthy at least. Their menu is extensive and I would go back and try something else, maybe these weren't their signature dishes. There is meter parking in front right on Yonge Street or you can park in the side streets east of Yonge for free if you're willing to walk a bit. It is pretty cramped and loud but they had plenty of servers to take care of the tables when we were there on Friday night."}
{"text":"Location is good but extremely hard to find parking.  Good selection of desserts but lack the proper taste.  Service is slow & probably won't be back :("}
{"text":"I'd say that the quality is pretty good, but the prices knocked a star off for me. We got the sesame soup, almond soup, taro sago and mixed fruit with purple rice desserts. I'd say that the sesame was the best, because it was thick and creamy, just like it's supposed to be. The almond was acceptable but was really lacking in the almond flavor that the Chinese dessert is supposed to be known for. The fruit and purple rice is pretty good - they give you the standard cantaloupe and honeydew, plus the more interesting papaya and mango.   Try to stay away from the sago stuff though - watery with not much flavor.  And like I said, portions small for the price and the uneven quality, and so I probably won't come again unless it's the only place open when I want Chinese dessert."}
{"text":"We were down the street for a birthday dinner which was a complete and utter disappointment as we left more hungry than we walked in and we had eyed this place on our way and had heard great things about. Still craving something, we decided to venture in and check out the hype - and we were not disappointed whatsoever! Thankfully we came at the perfect time and didn't have to wait in line as long as some of the other people. Despite how busy the place was, our orders came surprisingly quickly. The longest part was deciding what to get! Everything was unique and unlike anything we've had before (and we practically live in Willowdale and have tried everything there) and it was super light, as well. We originally walked in hoping for something sweet and somewhat of a late night desert but ended up getting the popcorn chicken and the fried calamari. Because the prices were so cheap, and the food was delicious, we ended up eating until we were full! Haven't yet tried the drinks yet, as most of the poor reviews are criticizing their drinks the most, but I'll come back to update this review after I go there again as I plan to very soon. Very snazzy decor too! More importantly, the selfie lighting was on fleek ;)"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was attentive. It's the best place to enjoy Hong Kong dessert in mtl."}
{"text":"Love coming here to have their golden sago mix. So light and refreshing! However their service is TERRIBLE.  Extremely slow especially when the hoards of young Asians come in late at night. Food and desserts take forever!  The water here tastes bad and stale as well. But for the love of the dessert I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Came here on the opening week with my friends. They had a grand opening promotion which is 20% off if we post a picture on our Instagram. So of course we did! The food was okay but the portion was a bit small.. Especially for the eel rice. My favorite was the mango drink, it kind of tasted like a mango dessert but I still like it. Overall, it's a decent place to hang out with friends when we want something light."}
{"text":"The food was good, except the knife they gave me had a piece of dry tissue stuck on it, asked for a new one... Then the bowl they gave me had a piece of dry food stuck in it.... Asked for a new one and then the plate they gave me had a brown sauce stain on it."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and have never been disappointed with the service or food. It's always consistently as good as I expect it to be and it's open late and able to accommodate my random sweet tooth cravings. It's largely a dessert place, but they do serve savoury items as well. Dishes I've had in the past and really enjoyed: kiwi lemon fruit tea, hong kong style steamed rice roll, japanese style popcorn chicken, mango pancake w/ sundae supreme, golden sago mixed & stewed egg white with milk and ginger. Will definitely be back in the future to try more goodies!"}
{"text":"Food was alright but I smelled of oil by the time I came out of the place. Not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"This one is MUCH better than the location next to owl of minerva in willowdale. Mostly, due to space. All the desserts taste good and so do the snacks. I personally wouldn't get an entire meal here, it's best for the tentacles, beef and fish balls, popcorn chicken that sort of thing. I love their black sesame parfait. The price is pretty good as well about 7 dollars per item. However, I had to take off one star for the lack of them taking debit. I understand why businesses won't take them to gain the charge from the ATM as well as saving money from the terminal but honestly it's just not practical for customers, I hate having to deal with the money before or after coming when I can usually just tap and go. Still won't make me stop but I know i've turned myself away from going because of this."}
{"text":"Probably the only place on Mississauga that serves dessert and most enjoyably their popcorn chicken cartilage. I can't find any other place that serves popcorn chicken cartilage and I usually get that every time I go.  Overall the atmosphere is nice to hang out with friends and to have a chat with - I go there if I am ever feeling their mango sago dessert too!  Would recommend to try."}
{"text":"I got the sesame paste with glutinous rice. They forgot about my order. Though I asked about it, they lied and said my order takes longer to make. Two minutes later, the waiter asked what I ordered. I confirmed my order. He ran back out in 30 seconds with a bowl of cold lumpy sesame paste. I asked if it's supposed to be cold or hot, he said either. Obviously trying to bullsheet his way through. I tasted it. It was cold in that lukewarm not meant to be cold way. I asked for it to be heated. He \"heated it\", said its \"warmed\" and if I wanted it hotter, I can let him know. It was half warm at best. By the time I asked for it to be heated, I realized the sesame paste was crappy lumpy, lukewarm, or hot. It just sucked - everything sucked."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service and it's cash only. So bring cash people! Though there is a ATM installed at the entrance when you walk in, a table next to us just got up and left because of how inconvenient it was. My friend and I sat down the same time with the couple next to us. Get this, they got their food and everything, finished eating, paid and left right when we got our food an hour later. They obviously forgot about our order because we had to tell the staff our order again 40 minutes later AND one staff came over to ask us what we wanted for our free topping... (so you didn't punch in our order, hence why you're asking us now... 45 mins later). I won't be coming back here again.  If you want traditional tofu pudding, do not order the \"Traditional Tofu Pudding\". The texture is mushy and nothing about it is the traditional ones I've had. It is watery and starchy. I'd rather have the tofu pudding in dim sum in Chinatown if I wanted something this bad.   I was hoping this new location would be better from its original location on Yonge st but I remember why I didn't go back the second time. And most people I know would agree with me on this one."}
{"text":"I ordered the mango pancake with ice cream. It was okay. The ice cream was good, but it was just store bought ice cream so how can it be bad? I felt the pancake was a bit thick and it was impossible to cut through without the cream gushing out and getting all over the place. There also wasn't much mango inside the pancake itself.   Service wise, the food came fast. However, the waitress wasn't the best. She constantly walked around and hovered around while we were trying to decide what to order, making us feel rushed while there were empty tables around us and no one waiting at the door. She also took away my dish right as I finished it. I hardly had time to put my fork down.   Overall, food was good but the service made me feel very rushed like they wanted us out."}
{"text":"I never had a bad experience with the dessert until this time. Usually everything we order, no matter how random or unusual will taste fantastic. This time we got the Strawberry Pearl Delight and oh my gosh.... It tasted like expired medicine with milk.... My recommendation is that they either take it off the menu or just taste test it prior to serving it to customers... I am so turned off by this experience, probably will not return for awhile. *for all the SPKs that have an opinion about this review... Just FYI, I was an avid supporter of this place and had recommended numerous people to go."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself has a nice vibe. The food is alright (not the greatest but not the best) and is at a decent price.  I've heard that the waiting was really long when it first opened but I went recently around 1 pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. We didn't have to wait long to be seated or to get our food. However, it was freezing cold in the restaurant for some reason?  The service wasn't good. The staff looked like they'd rather be anywhere else (which is understandable but not professional). They also messed up our order (they gave us the wrong dish)."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times. I love the variety of food and desserts they have here. I have tried the chocolate ice cream parfait, Strawberry Apple Italian soda, Strawberry lime Italian Soda, the supreme crepe, and the popcorn chicken. Some of the food was amazing. I always get the strawberry Apple Italian soda and popcorn chicken. The parfait and lime soda was not the greatest so you should be careful of what you order. The parfait was okay but I did not like the grass jelly inside the parfait (extremely chewy and classes with the ice cream). The Apple strawberry soda is better than the lime. The service is extremely slow but the overall atmosphere of the place is pretty nice. Very clean, comfy chairs and the mood was nice. Would go again but I will have to be careful ordering."}
{"text":"The food here is typical of that you'd find at any other Chinese dessert/bubble tea house, so don't expect too much. I come here because of its great location, and they're one of the few places nearby that serve the rice rolls with XO/peanut sauce I love so much. Their popcorn chicken is also pretty decent but, again, that can be found at almost any bubble tea spot. The first time I went, I ordered the black grass jelly in coconut milk, and the second time I switched it to the herbal jelly - almost no difference, except for the *slight* bitter aftertaste that's expected of the herbal jelly. The service the first time was great, but horrible the next... typical (sadly) of most Asian places. 3 stars for average food, good location but poor service."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here, they CONSISTENTLY have bad service. It's quite disappointing because I think I'd enjoy this place and the food better if only they had the capacity to accommodate us better.   Tell me how in my latest experience with them, we waited at least 30 minutes to be seated with the latter part of the wait having 3 tables perfect for our party size (4)?! When we asked the waitress to be seated (after clearly standing at the door for some time and already \"checked in\"), she laughs embarrassingly and says \"oops, I forgot\". HOW!?! I... HOW EVEN!??!??!?!  I'm surprised this time around we were able to get the items we wanted becaue they usually always \"run out\" of everything I always want to try. Always.  I come back because I have a terrible sweet tooth and its conveniently close to one of my favourite fast food Chinese restaurants on the same street. If I find a new dessert place nearby, I would be SO down for that instead."}
{"text":"This place always gives me mixed feelings. I love the food but honestly the service sometimes makes me not want to come back    Pros: the food and desserts are very good! The following are my favourites.    - Taiwanese Popcorn chicken: That is only of my favourites, always made so fresh and the salty and peppery taste is so good. It's a must have if your there.  - House special mango grass jelly: It has sago, mango, grass jelly and a creamy mango base! If your a mango lover like me, you will absolutely love it.  - Mint & Lychee Italian Soda: really real refreshing drink. It also has a lychee or two in there too!    Cons: service here really gets to me. Sometimes the server will notice you but sometimes they don't, even if you hit the button. I also do not like how it is cash only, pretty weird for a franchise of this nature. The main thing is that if you get something and you don't like it, they do not take it back. One time when I went and ordered the bubble waffle, the server pretty much told me that I had to keep it even though it was rock hard and wasn't soft like a typical bubble waffle. This was very annoying. I had to pay for an item which I took one bite out of. I haven't come back to often since that incident.    Overall; I may try other locations instead. Service here has not gotten better ever since that incident so I do mot feel compelled to keep coming back"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner, ordered TWO taiwanese popcorn chicken.. After an hour of waiting,i asked the server, She said five minutes, after 15 minutes the food finally came out, but only ONE order, i got angry the fact that i had to wait more than an hour, and its still wrong... The worst part, after i complained, she said its because of changing shifts, As a costumer, i don't care if its changing shift, and there is computer where employees can actually look at the orders. Besides, she did not apologize nor say anything but just blaming the fact that it was because of the changing shift."}
{"text":"Great dessert and snack place. But Not so good on the main dishes.. and very slow services on the weekends"}
{"text":"A nice place to visit if you are craving some late night desserts. This location is always super busy at night. Sometimes there could be a lineup. Tried some various desserts. They are all pretty decent. Service was pretty good considering how busy it was."}
{"text":"I was afraid to visit this place based on all the negative reviews but my experience was okay. The service is cold and it is difficult to get the waitresses attention but luckily they have one of those service call buttons.   Once we ordered the desserts they came pretty quick.  House special mango with sago and grass jelly $6.49 - tasted really good and it was a refreshing dessert on a hot summer day.  Lychee black pearl delight $4.99 - the dessert looked like sago but it was actually chia seeds. This is my first time trying it and I liked it very much. There was a good amount of lychee and there was also mochi and lychee jelly to give it different textures.   Pink lady drink $4.49 - basically a watermelon and mango drink. I really enjoyed this drink since water melon and mango's are probably my favourite fruit so combining them together made it that much better."}
{"text":"This is a cozy, little dessert place if you have time to spare.  The wait time wasn't great, but you could see how busy and packed they were (this was about 10PM). The place was clean and the decor was dark and modern. The noise level was, in all honesty, disastrous... I could hardly hear the people at my table. The dessert was decent; I had the mango pancakes, which were served with vanilla ice cream and mango pieces. This type of pancake should taste a bit egg-y, but there's not much to the ones here. Although I was a bit disappointed about that, the flavours of the entire plate came together quite well. The service was great, and prompt too. I'd say the value/cost was fair.   All in all, it's a good place to hang out. They've got a fantastic menu, and I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Large variety, decent prices, but not that good. If you're going with a lot of friends the items are easy to share but honestly there's better dessert places. They also have savoury food though, if you are looking for a place that have both. Not that much seating and very crammed when you do get a seat.  I got a mango sago for $6.25, which was essentially a watered down mango nectar with sago and a few mango chunks. Wasn't too mad just because it wasn't horrible and it is pretty cheap. But there wasn't that much of it & that point I would have been better off buying a large mango slush from Coco or Chatime. Main issue is there wasn't much taste.   Also ordered a mango shaved ice, which seems to be one of the favourites here. It was better than the mango sago, makes for a good picture as well. I shared with a friend just because the taste gets too repetitive. Overall it was good not something I'd get over and over again though. Didn't leave me wanting more."}
{"text":"The couple of times we went for desserts, we didn't have to wait at all or didn't have to wait for too long for a table despite the very limited seating available. Service is quick. Desserts are very good. Our favorite is E1!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the wait for it??? Come on.. seriously ill starve before it comes... It's funny cause their uniforms say keep calm and eat dessert.. yea keep calm cause service is super slow!!!"}
{"text":"1* ~ service 3* ~ food  We came saturday for lunch seeing as how busy it gets during peak hours. The service was horrendous, as we waited more than 20 minutes for a waiter to approach the table evm though we had pressed the button to alert them multiple times and honestly thought it was broken.  My friend and i got our curry first and 10 min later our friend's noodles came, by that time our curry has already got cold. We ordered two waffle icecream things and they told us it will take 30 minutes to prepare! That is insane considering it literally takes like 10 min max to make literally anywhere else!   We also had to go up to the counter anytime we wanted water. Which makes it apparent that waiter service is non existant.   The food was mediocre, our curry katsu was eatered down. The waffle desserts were creative but doesnt beat the $3 chinatown ones that you get hot pipin fresh. And for the price of the dessert? Lol but thats a big no thank you."}
{"text":"Great little dessert place. A lot of variety with great dessert, but the service is not that great. Normally 2 waitress running around. Nice that it opens late.  I would give it 3.5/5 stars. Tried the pickled pork rice once and I would say the actual food is not that great. It was just a mush! The shaved ice, sago, drinks are great!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this sugar marmalade location.  This location was very small and seemed kind of crowded. My visit was around 3:30-4:30 and it wasn't very busy there were a couple of empty tables. I was seated right away the second I walked in. Ordering was fast and easy you just write the number on a slip of paper. There was so many options to choose from! My friend and I ordered a total of 3 things two of which were cold \"desserts\" and one was hot and what they called a \"snack\". For the hot item I ordered the Hong Kong style steamed rice role it was so good! I wish it had more sauce (peanut butter and hoisin sauce) but overall I it was good. The cold desserts was the taro sago mixed and the other was the taro black glutinous rice w/ pearl delight. When they arrived I was first confused because I wasn't sure if it was our order and the server wasn't even sure she asked us \"did you order this?\" But we casually answered yes and tried to figure it out. We assumed we would be able to see more of the added \"toppings\" on top of the \"soup\". After we figured it out we digged in. I order the taro black glutinous rice w/ pearl delight it tasted great overall but I especially enjoyed the glutinous balls. They were so chewy, and they were just the right amount of sweet! The food is relatively cheap compared to a lot of other places. I would definitely order again and I would definitely visit this location again."}
{"text":"I actually had been to this place several times and I really like here. Me and my friend got  1. House special black grass jelly mixed 2. Taiwanese Style Popcorn Chicken on Rice 3. Stewed Beef Brisket on Rice Noodle with Special Sauce  The portion were very big that we couldn't even finish it. In terms of taste, they were very good as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant really disappointed me because there was a lot of hype around it. I had their Oreo Bubble Tea and Mango Pancake. The bubble tea was okay, but sometimes I would find myself drinking clusters of Oreo powder. They also put that powder around the rim of the drink which was very messy and sad-looking. Their Mango Pancake was what saved the day as it was very sweet and savory! Highly recommend their desserts but their bubble tea is sub-par."}
{"text":"Was excited to try out a new Chinese dessert place with a friend but was greatly disappointed. At first glance, it looks pretty nice but nothing outstanding.  The menu was okay, ended up ordering: - Fresh mango black jelly mixed - green tea and red bean shaved ice - original Milk green tea - Original milk black tea  The desserts tasted too sweet and nothing special about it. The shaved ice was unexpected and disappointing according to my friend. The bubble tea comes in one size only with option of tapioca or jelly for extra cost. Again, there was nothing that stood out from the experience.   By the way, wifi password is 10 8's not 11 like another reviewer mentioned. Yes the wifi is pretty slow better to use your own Internet.   Would I come back? No thank you."}
{"text":"The good: this is one of my go to places for desserts in the yonge area. Although I didn't order the golden treasure mixed (number E2 on the menu), it's the best dish here. It has mango, aloe, popping yogurt, sago, grapefruit.. All mixed in with mango juice and ice cream! Great dish!  The bad: unfortunately what I ordered was the marshmallow toast. I mean it was exactly what it sounds, and it looks great on pictures, but nothing new!   The ugly: nothing that I can think of.  Neutral: great for groups. Can get busy on a weekend. Their savoury dishes aren't too bad!"}
{"text":"We went here for dessert last night with our group of friends. I had the mango supreme and it gave me a bad stomach ache. My SO had a piece of my mango supreme and also got sick. Our friends ordered something that had no mango contents and were fine. Beware."}
{"text":"I recently came here for the first time for some dessert after dinner with my girlfriend. I've been to the Yonge location countless times and it's definitely one of my go to places for desserts. This location is much more spacious and well-decored compared to the one at Yonge. Plus, I believe that they added a few more items to their menu, which is great. The waitress seated us quickly and my girlfriend ordered her favourite dessert - Taro Black Glutinous Rice with Peal Delight (G9) while I got one of their new additions.  After around 30 minutes of waiting, my girlfriend was finally served her dessert while my order was still nowhere in site. The problem escalated when she ate a piece of the taro and told me that it tasted \"very funny and sour\". She asked me to try a piece and I immediately spat it out on the plate when I tasted the spoiled taro. It was absolutely disgusting. Then, I called the waitress and told her the situation. She took away the dish back to the kitchen, came back with it after a few minutes and whispered \"sorry, I'll give you a discount\". I then told her that I did not want the rest of the spoiled dessert (we only ate 2 pieces of the taro) and that I would like to order something else for my girlfriend. She looked slightly confused and took away our dessert, completely ignoring what I said. After another 15 minutes or so, they finally served my order. After I finished my food, I did not want to ask the waitress for the menu again to order for my girlfriend and be forced to wait for another 30 minutes, so I just asked for the bill.   It took them another 10 minutes or so to finally give us the bill, where they charged us for my girlfriend's order and gave us a 10% discount on our total order at the bottom. At this point, I was very pissed off from my whole experience and I went up to find the waitress as I knew that it would take another 10 minutes to get her attention. She said that they tasted the taro from the container and it was fine, and that no other customer complained about it being spoiled. I told her that both my girlfriend and I tried the taro, and it was 100% spoiled. After another minute of back and forth, they finally said that they'll take the taro dessert off of our bill.   Overall, it was not only painfully difficult to get the waitress' attention (maybe they were understaffed with 2 waitresses and 2 people in the kitchen, but the place was literally half empty...), but I hated their entire approach to the situation. The taro dessert comes down to around $5, but it's the principle here that's important. I guess this truly exemplifies their take on customer service. I definitely would not have been as upset if they apologized right away and offered us another dessert instead of completely ignoring our table for the rest of the night and being extremely defensive when the bill came. I will definitely share this story with my family and friends and make sure to stick to the Yonge location from now on."}
{"text":"Here we go!   So I've been here couple times and have to say the desserts are good depending which ones you get. Sometimes they have it in Stock or just ran out.    The reason for one star is the service. I went twice and had my order forgotten both times. Although second time they forgot me and my gfs order. Both times I made eye contact with the server and asked and still doesn't answer or even bother to come over. They are too busy on their phones or talking to their friends or even leaving the building for a smoke.   I don't know whether I'm unlucky but damn that was ridiculous two times both forgotten. Never gone back since."}
{"text":"Came here to have some desserts with a group of friends. We were 8 people and they were polite enough to accommodate our group size really quickly. Sadly, there isn't much that I enjoyed.  Staff: They were nice and they communicated to one of my friends that their dish takes 20 minutes, so it's always appreciated (rather than places which don't tell you).  Ambience: The place was very stuffy which was the biggest downside of my experience. They could use some ventilation. It wasn't even a hot day outside, but it was very uncomfortable being in there. The black walls made the place look a little dingy. And they were apparently out of clean bowls so my food was served in a take out container. It was all off putting to be quite honest.  Food: I had the Oreo Cheesecake pudding and although it was tasty, it was quite small for $5.99.   My overall opinion is that there are better places elsewhere (and close by)."}
{"text":"I didn't expect there is such a great variety of dessert.  Great place to hang out & share different kind of dessert with friends."}
{"text":"Ordered a durian pancake. The shell that wraps the durian was a bit thick, could be a bit thinner. Also ordered a mango Saigon it was so good that I forgot to take a picture of it. Service was good but the location is a bit small so not good for large groups."}
{"text":"Very cute and small dessert place. Menu has a wide range of variety from dessert to drinks to snacks and entrees. Service is friendly and atmosphere is cozy. Recommend for hangouts for sure. Prices are very good 5-7$/item. The portions are also fairly generous.   What I ordered: Drinks:  strawberry and apple soda, strawberry and lime soda.  They mix strawberry jam with flavours and lime inside the soda. It's pretty interesting and quite refreshing.   Desserts: Fresh fruit Pearl delight: a coconut milk base with white tapiocas with ice cream, pearls, watermelons, strawberries, mangoes, melons and strawberries. The variety was amazing and the sweetness is just right.   Mango soy bean pudding(tofu pudding): this one was okay... wasn't expecting much. Presentation and taste was okay. Do not recommend it.    Mango pancakes: crepe wrapped with mango and crème inside and topped with ice cream and mango cubes. The pancakes were soft and the crème mixed with mangoes was just unbelievable! Definitely recommend it for mango lovers.  Strawberry pearl delight: strawberry milk base with white tapioca, pearls and strawberry. 2 words... strawberry heaven. Though some might thinks it's too sweet. The appearance isn't too great but it tastes good!   Snacks: Fish and beef balls: tastes pretty normal to me, something you can easily get from pacific mall and wouldn't know the difference to.  Entree: Minced pork on rice: the pork and egg was well marinated and tender. Not too dry. The portion was quite large.   All in all, everything here only cost about $55 which is pretty good. It was my first time at this location and I think I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Pretty small and tight seating area, washroom were really dirty, servers had hard time communicating, but food and drink were delicious and menu selection is lengthy."}
{"text":"Durian Lovers Alert! For all you Durian Lovers, I'd recommend trying this place out.   I ordered their Hot Black Glutinous Rice with Durian and added Pearl Delights. There was a chunk of Durian inside with a good ratio of all the other items. Would recommend it as a hot dish because the flavors are enhanced (but it's also winter right now so that was a nice touch before going out in the cold). They have many other durian combos to choose from (Panna cotta, Mochi, Pancake, Grass Jelly, etc).   We also tried the Mango Mochi Supreme and was disappointed. It was very sour because they used fresh mangos but they're not in season right now (January).  Parking at the back is free but it shares the same Lot as Owl of Minerva. I'd come again just because they have Durian options."}
{"text":"Despite the long wait if you arrive after dinner time, the desserts in this place is bomb dot come! The presentation of all the desserts are the same as what shown in their menu! I ordered 5 different ones when our group went yesterday - all 5 stars. My favourite ones are their house special green tea redbean shaved ice and coconut grass jelly sago with redbean. Yay... I am a redbean type of girl ;) They seem to have regular food at this place too but it's definitely more famous for its sweets! Will explore more items on the menu next time I visit. 100% revisit and highly recommend."}
{"text":"More 3.5 stars.  Hm, I like this place.  It offers the Taiwanese desserts that I can't easily find elsewhere in my neighborhood with the same quality.  I basically want to try all the desserts on their menu.  Had one of the grassjelly desserts with chocolate and vanilla ice cream, taro, would definitely go back to try the sagos and mango pancakes *_*   The popcorn chicken was pretty standard, I wasn't too impressed with the minced pork/preserved eggs dish though.  Pork too oily and they served the dessert before the salty food, could put some more thought into the service."}
{"text":"I came in with 4 other friends and we only waited about 5 mins for a table - a rarity on a Friday night!  We ordered: HK style deep fried calamari, spicy curry fish balls, Japanese teriyaki fries, matcha & red bean shaved ice, black sesame parfait, matcha panacotta, special pomelo aloe drink, but green tea  On this evening, their service was quick and waitstaff attentive even with the option of call button at the table. The food came in order and beautifully plated."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that they've added savoury offers into their menu.  Whether meeting clients or friends, I am happy coming to this place as there's something for everyone to choose from and with the addition of wifi, it's like they don't want me to leave! Only drawback is the CASH only payment method.   At this visit, I ordered the popcorn chicken with rice, my friends ordered curry chicken on rice, Japanese teriyaki fries, Japanese style popcorn chicken, stewed beef with rice and for dessert we ordered frostbite taro drink, black sesame parfait, oreo cheesecake and  original egg waffle.  Our server was attentive and we only used the table call button once! She routinely came around refilling our water glass and asking if we needed anything, yet allowed us to feel like we could stay for as long as we want. And this evening, we stayed for a little bit over 4 hours!  The food came as they looked on the menu, crispy if it's supposed to be crispy, hot if hot and plentiful!"}
{"text":"Bad service! Food was alright. Went there twice.  The first time my husband and I went at night around 9, the place was not crowed at all. We placed the order and waited 30minutes. When we were patiently waiting, no server came over to check on us. Finally I got one of the server's attention and ask to check on the food. He did not come back and tell me what happened. 10more minutes the 2 sweet soup that we ordered finally arrived. The sweet soups were neither hot nor cold, it was at room temperature, that's disappointing.   The second time we went was on Boxing Day around 3pm. We ordered 2 meals and 2 drinks and this time the food and arrived in a reasonable time. Unfortunately, they served me a cold drink when I ordered a hot one, then the server simply popped my cold drinks in the microwave, again that's disappointing... It was a taro milk tea...   I guess the service was so bad because the tips is already added in the tap as service charge, so the server's performance really doesn't matter as tips is already guaranteed...  Anyway, time to look for another dessert place in the area"}
{"text":"I came here with 2 friends and we were here to sample their shaved ice. Man, did they blow our expectations away.   We ended up getting 4 desserts that were fountain creation works of art - Mango ice w/jellies and condensed milk, Green Tea Ice w/boba and red beans, Sago w/durian, and a Chocolate waffle pancake w/cream.  Totally enjoy these and will come back."}
{"text":"Dessert was alright, but they are not the best especially the traditional Chinese dessert (purple sticky rice/almond soup...etc). Portion is relatively small for the price they are asking.  But their taiwanese main course is awesome. Love their deep fried chicken and shrimp ball"}
{"text":"Really small place. They serve both food and desserts. Mainly Asian styled desserts but also western such as waffles etc. they have a wide variety which is good because everyone is bound to find something they like. They also have fresh juices here. It's really crowded tho so I don't think it's great for groups"}
{"text":"Neat menu choices. Clean place.  Prices ok but portions a tad small.  No combos. A chain with a few restaurants."}
{"text":"Asian desserts, yes!  I've been looking for one of these places.  The best way that I can describe the desserts are that they are bubble tea, but in a bowl. I had this dish with mango and grass jelly and my friend had a dish with coconut, tapioca and those balls that burst when bitten into.  I like these desserts because they are sweet, but not too sweet.  The desserts can come hot or cold and there are also other dishes such as crepes with fruit and of course, they also have bubble tea.  The presentation of the dishes was beautiful (see photo) and the place itself was nice and clean.  It was a good place to catch-up as the restaurant wasn't too loud.  I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"It's an okay Asian dessert place. They also sell snacks and actual dishes. I ordered a black sesame parfait (AA2) and marshmallow toast.  Black sesame parfait: Today it came with more mango and cream, so I had trouble finishing the dessert as it started to get a little boring. The cereal at the bottom made it slightly easier to finish. Overall, I like the parfait.  Marshmallow toast: My first time having toast as dessert! It was soft and the marshmallows made it sweet, but it was also hard to eat because of how sticky the marshmallows were. Like most desserts, I soon got tired of it because there wasn't much depth to the flavour.  Some other things I tried from my friends were:  Spicy beef ball: It was quite dry on the outside.  Honey garlic chicken wings: Also quite dry on the outside, and I didn't taste the honey flavour very much.  I like coming to Sugar Marmalade when I'm in the mood for Asian snack dishes or dessert, but if I had other options, I probably wouldn't choose this place."}
{"text":"I love this place for its variety even though the food is a hit or miss. I got the supreme mango pancake with sundae. The mangos were not ripe which I didn't like. Perhaps they were going for the crunchy texture but it didn't work for me. The pancake itself has a weird texture as well that I cannot quite explain. My friend ordered the frostbite taro drink and I quite enjoyed it. It had brown sugar jelly with tapioca and I thought it was very interesting. The brown sugar really came through! We shared the Taiwanese popcorn chicken and it was done very well, no complaints there.   I wish this restaurant would open a location closer to where I live because I enjoy the selections offered at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered a mango ice cream crepe. Inside the folded crepes was cream and mango. The mango was sweet and tasted fresh. There was also a generous helping of ice cream on top of the crepes. Yum!   The wait was a little long. The place was PACKED, so expect at least a 20 minute wait if you're going on the weekend. It didn't help that I was going in an awkward group of three. Service was fine and prompt when we requested things like water. Our orders came quick, which made up for the wait. As with many Asian places, this is a cash only dessert place. However, they have an ATM at the front, which is pretty convenient.  If I'm in the area, I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to dessert locations, so I was so happy that they finally opened one in Markham! The decor is cute but modern, I love their dessert typography wall. They have a lot of variety on conventional Taiwanese and Hong Kong desserts. They usually have something I'd be craving. Quality and portions aren't the best, the mango sweet soup you can taste the obvious preservatives. I love their black pearls (which are chia seeds), another must eat are the crepes."}
{"text":"Came here for late night dessert/snacks over the holidays and was surprised that it wasn't that full. We did not have to wait for a seat.  The menu offers a large variety of foods.. from snacks to meat/rice dishes.. to hot/cold Asian desserts!   I ordered the Taro Black Glutinous Rice with Pearl Delight ($5.99) and it was absolutely delicious. The portions here are much larger than other traditional Chinese dessert places I've been to.. and when you ask for hot.. they actually serve you a nice hot bowl of dessert.. not lukewarm.  Also ordered the Japanese Style Popcorn Chicken ($7.99).. it is basically popcorn chicken with mayo/dressing on top similar to a takoyaki... I personally did not enjoy this too much -- the mayo on top was a little too much and very filling!  Overall, I would def. be back. The prices are very reasonable and desserts and snacks are good.   PS. They have a rewards system w/ vincity card.. spend $100 get a free drink.. etc.."}
{"text":"This location was open on Christmas Day, which is an automatic bonus star in my mind - though I will say that independent of their holiday hours, I'd still give them 3.5 stars. This location is pretty small so it was crowded when we showed up - some of the seats can be a bit cramped.  We tried a range of desserts, including some ice cream, jelly, hot sesame soup, and also glutinous rice balls. Everyone enjoyed the food - the only complaints were that the drinks were a tad on the sweet side (though you can request sweetness adjustments if you want), that they don't offer coffee on their menu, and that the portions are on the smaller side. (The prices are also somewhat lower than other comparable dessert places, so I would say it's not a downside.)  Re: ambiance - music was a tad loud, which makes it hard to have quality conversation for a long time... So ambiance is probably a 3/5 (vs a place like Mabu, which I'd give a 4/5)."}
{"text":"Went to Mississauga location and was very disappointed. My family ordered 6 different items which we all sampled and none were tasty. Service there was also slow. Coming to this location, I did not expect much. However, my Parfait was pretty good! All my friends dishes came out at about the same time, there was WiFi, it wasn't too loud, and we enjoyed our stay. The desserts were pretty and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"New sugar marmalade opened up! The service is nice, the dessert is amazing, and the food is comfy"}
{"text":"So far so amazing. I love the atmosphere and he menu choices are unreal. I'm skeptical of how much on the menu can be good because of the quantity. Also the service is great too. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I thought this place was alright.  A friend brought me and the staff seem to be familiar with him, so perhaps that helped as I didn't experience the bad service as per other reviews.  I ordered some House-Special of a sago/grass jelly dessert and what was served did NOT look like the photo on the menu.  I swear that in the pic of the item I wanted, it appeared as though it contained mango...although what arrived was basically b&w.  Dessert arrived quickly...almost too quickly, re:  a coupla minutes after ordering.  Then again, it's probably a scoop of this and a scoop of that.  How come we don't have one of these dessert places in 'ssauga??"}
{"text":"Note:  Update is based on hot foods.  You know what, I'm updating my review because I had a much better impression during my second visit!  I do find the menu a bit overwhelming because it's quite extensive, especially for the array of desserts they serve.  I didn't bother ordering anything that was pudding-like (sago, black rice, etc.) because last time I felt as though it was just canned evaporated milk + canned fruits.  I could be wrong, but that's what I remembered based on my first+last visit.  Instead, I stuck to the Milk Oolong Tea (~$5-6), which I requested with less sugar.  And it was nice, subtlely fragrant, similar to Jasmine Tea, and the perfect amount of \"sweetness\" for me!  My friend ordered the Japanese Popcorn Chicken ($8.49) and Japanese Curry Rice (~$8).  Both tasted very good and at great price points!  In general, the savoury foods seemed like much better value than desserts &/or drinks.  I had absolutely no problem with service, after figuring out that you write your order down + there's a service bell at each table."}
{"text":"Do not come here!!   Yes they have some cool desserts but the service and everything else about this place is terrible.   The place is small so when it's busy, you're literally sitting shoulder to shoulder with the other diners.   They have a bell on each table like most restaurants but I'm guessing the employees aren't trained to keep track of which table presses it, because the only way to get a waitress to your table is to call them. We rang the bell around 4 times but no one came.   We got the popcorn chicken, garlic and cheese toast, kimchi fries, peach smoothie, and golden royal drink.  I dipped my popcorn chicken in the sauce they provided and right as I was about to eat it, I noticed that there was a bug inside the sauce. I rang the bell for the waitress and (of course) no one came. We called for the waitress to let her know and she took away the sauce. She came back a while later with a plastic container for the sauce and just threw it on the table. She didn't say anything about the popcorn chicken that had already been dipped in the sauce or anything. When we asked for more napkins, she literally just gave us one.   As for the drinks, they often have chunks of fruit or jelly in them and they're larger than the straw itself."}
{"text":"Went in for the Matcha Shaved ice only to find out, after one and a quarter hour, that they don't have it anymore. Shame, cause that's what I really wanted to try being a matcha fan but otherwise all great and would definitely go back there to try their other stuff, aside from dessert they also have chicken wings and curry fishballs...This place is still rather new that you can't get a table quickly, people are flocking in to try something new. A must visit!"}
{"text":"Arrived around 9:45pm on a Friday night. It was full but we only had to wait approximately 15 minutes. Modern and clean decor. Served cold water upon getting seated. Too many choices on the menu. ;) We wrote our order on the slip of paper and pushed the red button on the table to summon the wait staff. The desserts were perfect. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A dessert place (that's not actually just desserts) with a hipster Asian vibe. It's got a huge selection of Taiwanese desserts. The vanilla mousse cup thing was surprisingly amazing. At first glance it seems super simple but it's really tasty and light so you have room to get more goodies. I also shared the marshmallow brick toast with a friend. This was more of a flop. It was hard to share because the marshmallows are really gooey. There's a bit of chocolate sauce between the toast and the top but it's kind of dry...like cut the top of your mouth dry. The shop is a bit small so I could see it being difficult to seat a bigger party during busier times. I saw a few people working on their laptops which made sense because of the free WiFi but I'm not sure if the music would be bothersome to some. Will be back to try the sago concoctions."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place being a decent dessert place and was brought here by a friend to check it out.  We ordered the milk toast and it was exactly as it sounds: buttered toast with a condensed milk drizzle. Presentation was simple and a little bit uninspiring. We had also ordered the Taiwanese fried chicken, which I have no real complaints about.  The service was incredibly slow, as other tables seated after us were being served before us. Our server also had written down the wrong order for us and had to refire the ticket with our correct order (but not after bringing the incorrect order).   The thing that bothered me the most is how visibly dusty the ceiling is. While I'm not usually a stickler for cleanliness (especially at Asian restaurants) but when you have a restaurant interior that's designed to be sleek and presentable, it's very distracting and honestly disgusting to have your black ceiling tiles caked in dust around the air vents. Even the sprinklers next to the vents were completely covered in dust. I would've hated to be sitting under those vents. Absolutely disgusting to be eating directly under that filth.  Overall, food is nothing to write home about and the service and overall cleanliness of the place could use work."}
{"text":"Most reviews have covered what I have to say. So here's my summary: great dessert place. I love their variety and great portion for the price. The people working there aren't very tentative so you definitely wave them down if you need something.  Parking in the can fill up quickly as that space is shared with 3 other eateries.  A lot of times I have to find street parking which is not always free."}
{"text":"Huge hit or miss with the menu, it's like gambling every time I come here.   There crepes come in huge portions and they are delicious. The parfaits and the different bowls with sago and grass jelly were absolutely disgusting. Parfait was overly sweet and creamy with too much whipped cream instead of real dairy. It felt like eating diabetes. The bowls were plain, watery, and tasteless.  Service here is also extremely slow, wait time for your dessert is usually 25-30 minutes. They won't refill your water unless you get their attention; however, it takes some effort to get the server's attention.  There are plenty of other amazing dessert places with lower price and better service."}
{"text":"Tried their green tea shaved ice cream and it was really underwhelming :( but the condensed milk toast was good! Great atmosphere and such a cute date place.   Would recommend and looking forward to going back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"First time going to this place. I have heard a lot about it as it is a Chinese theme dessert opened in montreal. Some good some bad, so I don't have high expectation due to past experience of Chinese dessert in montreal.   It was a cold winter night when my friends and I went. So I wanted something warm, I ordered my favorite and usual traditional Chinese dessert whenever I go to a dessert place; sesame soup (????- not all place can make it good, when they do, they know what they are doing. But unfortunately, they don't have it or ran out or whichever. Then I wanted to try the stew papaya egg white with milk, but they don't have whole papaya.....:( so I ended up with mix assorted sweet dumplings, nothing special, felt like those frozen one which you can purchase at any Chinese supermarket.   My friends ordered mango sagon mix, which it's decent, nothing special and the mango is sooooo sour!!! And as my sister said, the image is not instagram quality.  Does not look very appetizing so we don't bother taking picture of it.   I also ordered the mango crepe, surprisingly, it's decent but the crepe does not taste like it is freshly made as in it taste pre-made or packaged. Ironically, a Chinese dessert place has better western/fusion dessert better then Chinese dessert.   The place design is okay; cute comfy theme but I found the chair and tables seem a bit cheap for a newly opened restaurant.   The menu is huge which I found it to be a bit too much; confusing of what to try. I think they should concentrate on quality instead of quantity. But it is a gimmick to lure people to go back to try other desserts on the menu.   Service: I found the service is bad, the waitresses just doesn't seem like they care and the chef does not know what they are doing. I ordered two things then they told me they do not have, no recommendation, no nothing, just simply walked away. Usually when you don't have the dish on the menu, you inform customer at the beginning or recommends something else. There weren't even busy when we went. The dumpling I ordered have a choice of either ginger soup base of coconut milk base and I forgot I can pick. The waitress didn't bother to clarify and just gave me coconut milk - that dumpling is usually eat with ginger soup so it keeps you warm in winter time from what I know.   I've always hoping to have a decent restaurant focusing in traditional Chinese desserts such as sesame soup, herbal essence jelly, etc. but a lot of time it's disappointing. And so is this one. But I would still recommend it to try if you are in mood of Chinese dessert and don't want to drive to Toronto for it. Surprisingly this restaurant is from Toronto, but the quality is not as expected.   The only thing that attracts me to return again is the shave ice: one of my other favorite! But with such service, I'm not too sure."}
{"text":"Beautifully crafted desserts, looks exactly like in the photos. We had the mango shaved ice and green tea waffle. Super tasty and great service!"}
{"text":"This is not the place to go if you want bubble. Came here a couple of times and still think it's mehhhh.    In my opinion the bubble tea here is below average. Every time I order bubble tea here the drink comes warm or slightly cool even though its supposed to be a cold drink. I would always have to ask the server for a cup of extra ice. Most of the drinks taste watered down or lack flavour. Portion wise, the drinks are smaller than most places.   Desserts are alright. I've tried the strawberry shaved ice, it's nothing special. Similar to the ones you get from other places. I've also tried the mix fruit sago. This was horrible. The ice cream wasn't cold. It was cool and semi melted. All the fruits inside were also warm. So the dessert didn't taste refreshing at all....  Food wise, it's also meh. The popcorn chicken i get sometimes has soft bones inside even thought it's supposed to be chicken breast.   Overall, will not be coming back.   And from what I saw the last few times, their own waiters buy bubble tea from chatime instead. Even though their own restaurant sells bubble tea too. That's a little sad... but I get it since their drinks suck."}
{"text":"I wish I read the reviews before coming here because maaaaan, is the customer service HORRIBLE! Listen to the reviews on this page, because they're accurate! :(  First off, they give you a sheet of paper to write your order down. On the paper, there's a question that asks you whether or not you'd like to get your dessert with the rest of the food you're ordering or after you eat the main meal. We ticked the box that says \"after\".   Server comes with the food, bringing our cheesy baked katsu. About 5 minutes later, she gives us the egg waffle that we ordered. I was a bit annoyed, but I thought that maybe she was in a hurry and couldn't read the order ticket properly. But still, I called her to let her know, but all I got was a blank stare and no apology out of her. We didn't even hear a single sorry from her, she didn't seem to care much at all about the mistake LOL. Not to mention, she didn't care to give us separate cutlery for the dessert. We've gone to the Vaughan location and the server was very nice, asking us if we were ready for the dessert and gave us new spoons to eat our desserts with.   To top it all off, they had the audacity to complain about the amount of tip we gave OUT LOUD in the kitchen LOL. I can't believe they even think they have the right to be pissed off, expecting a decent tip after the horrible service we were given.   As for the food, by the way, the waffle and fries were amazing. But their rice dishes are very very mediocre. Almost tasted like cafeteria food, honestly.... Best to come here solely for desserts and small appetizers!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm actually going to say this but, THEY HAVE THE BEST TAKOYAKI IN TOWN!  Not even the takoyaki I've had in \"authentic\" Japanese restaurants tasted as good as Sugar Marmalade's takoyaki. So fluffy and savoury, they will literally melt in your mouth.   Service was also great. We didn't even have to ask for it, but the server gave us water as soon as we sat down. I would say the only down side to this restaurant is the fact that they only take cash! They have an ATM machine at the front but we were a bit irked that we had to pay for the service charge. But I guess we also have ourselves to blame for not doing our research before coming."}
{"text":"Honey oolong milk tea is way too sweet, the food portion is small and the price is too high. They definitely need to decorate their place. Not recommended for couples who expect romantic dessert place"}
{"text":"By far the worst experience I've had in a long time. We had to wait over 45 minutes to get 3 meals, all at different times. The waiters weren't too bad, but the kitchen staff really needs to up their game because multiple tables were complaining the same time as us. Food portions got smaller, with raised prices. Definitely will not come again"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite dessert place in Montreal, desserts aside, the popcorn chicken rice is a must try.   It was a busy night, but we still managed to get a table within a reasonable time, thanks to the excellent service of the waitresses. Will definitely visit again to try the Durian Mille-Feuille, it looked delicious as my friend was eating it."}
{"text":"Their quality dropped dramatically. Several friends complained to me they found the food no good. So be prepared for some disappointment."}
{"text":"I had the green tea shaved ice with red beans. I loved this place, the atmosphere and presentation of the dish was amazing. I will for sure be back to try more :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my friend. Overall not a bad place to catch up and have a chat due to their quiet atmosphere and the wide range of menu items. I ordered a Japanese curry chicken cutlet and added three dollars to get the soup. I do like the cutlet as its breaded nice and crispy however, the curry had a really weird texture to it...it was almost jelly like. It didn't taste bad per-say but I don't prefer the texture. The soup was one of those Asian health soups that you drink to hopefully live longer. I did like the taste and it was packed with ingredients I can't name."}
{"text":"A huge letdown.   Went here a couple of weeks ago on a Wednesday evening and ordered the chocolate HK style egg waffle with chocolate ice cream and banana slices. The cafe was only about half full but the dessert still took around 20 minutes to prepare. After waiting for so long we were expecting for the waffle to come out hot and fresh... which it was neither. It was room temperature, and the texture was hard, almost like a crunchy cookie - not at all what a waffle should feel like. I dare say it tasted as though it was made hours (days?) in advanced and then re-cooked over and over. Easily the worst egg waffle I have ever had. The chocolate ice cream was standard and of course how can you mess up a banana.   Will not be coming back. Even if there wasn't a plethora of other options in the area."}
{"text":"Was on my bookmark list for a while and decided to give it a try last night with a friend. Turns out it's one of the only dessert spots that serve real shaved ice as opposed to the crushed shaved ice. The flavours they have are green tea with red bean, strawberry, mango and I think there's 1 more. Super cheap too, only about $6 per serving. The green tea shaved ice is ok. It's only nice when you eat it with the red bean.  However the mango shaved ice is so Delicious!!!!!! It's a total must have!!!!! Also ordered the condensed milk toast. It took longer than the shaved ice itself to make but it's was warm and fluffy when served. A nice addition to have when eating your cold dessert. Also fairly cheap, about 4 dollars. They only have 1 restroom though and it you might have to wait a few minutes if the place is busy.  Tip is included in your bill so my total came up to about $11. Totally worth it and I'd come back to try the other shaved ice flavors.  :)"}
{"text":"- Ordered the Mango Sago, Taro Coconut sago and Condensed Milk Brick Toast. - Both sago's were delicious but the toast was too dry. - Staff was friendly and answered all our questions about the menu.  - Will return for some more sago :)"}
{"text":"I've seen tons of beautiful dessert posts, and snaps of this place on social media and I had to try this place for myself. I love the concept of this dessert place. It is a cute little shop that has very aesthetically pleasing desserts. It makes me feel like I'm not eating in Montreal but in somewhere in Asia. Which is why I'm not giving it a 1 star.   I've come here a few times in hopes it will be better although it won't be getting a 5 star. I've come on busy days and slow days. On busy days everything is slow so if you are having great conversation and patience, you'll be fine. You will wait a long time for your order to arrive and the overall service is not that great. There is a language barrier between most of the staff, which does get a bit frustrating when asking for certain things.   The dessert looks beautiful although, I don't feel it tastes great. I feel most of the desserts taste very bland, well as their drinks.  The entrees, on the other hand, have a lot of flavor, or at least the ones I've tried (fried squid, fries, popcorn chicken).  The only reason I come back is that my friend is obsessed with their Taro bbt lol."}
{"text":"Ehh I dunno. Something about the absentmindedness of the waiters and the quality of the desserts..it just made me not like it.   Also, I came because I really like the sugar marmalade downtown at spadina and dundas but somehow I can't bring myself to like this place at all.   On the up side, I think they might have a bigger selection of desserts. But idk if they're made well."}
{"text":"This franchise is small and typically very busy. I got the Mango Sago with Grass Jelly (F3). It was decently priced and sized, but I'd say the taste was average. It wasn't significantly impressive that you'll say WOW. The dessert however isn't too sweet which is always a good thing.   There's a huge variety of desserts on the menu. I had a hard time deciding on what to get as I wanted to try all of it! Will probably come back to try their durian desserts.  Service was prompt - the waitress were constantly refilling our waters."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday at noon for a snack Ordered:  - House Special Black Grass Jelly Mixed - Taiwanese Style Popcorn Chicken  - Golden Royal Drink - Japanese Teriyaki Fries  They didn't have tapioca for my House Special Black Grass Jelly Mixed so instead I substituted it for popping yogurt bubble I would have liked it with tapioca. How could they not have tapioca when they sell bubble tea?   The one in downtown Toronto provided water once we came in but the one in Mississauga we had to ask for water.   These four items cost approximately $30.   Overall I thought it was fine."}
{"text":"So first of there are a lot of pros and cons to this place.  Pros: variety of choices from desserts to hot meals. The food is delicious/dessert is tasty  Cons: It can get packed up and you may have a wait time I think it is debit and cash only.  Prep time is long  If you have a group of friends and are looking for a place to chill and wait for dessert then sure try this place for a variety of Asian treats.   side note: i enjoyed the cartilage chicken popcorn. the crunch of the bones adds to the texture but this may not be favored by everyone's palate."}
{"text":"The desserts are actually decent but the service is absolutely horrendous. The staff were so loud amongst themselves and they stomped around behind the counter, seemingly trying to riverdance or something, causing the floor and tables to shake. They hover when you are not finished your desserts and try to rush you out of your table. Most importantly, we specifically picked this place because it's listed to close at 2:00am. Listed Hours are wrong. Closes at 1 on weekdays. They turned away customers at 12:10. Staff try to kick you out 12:45 on a weekday, even though closing time is listed as 2am. When asked they say it's because they need time to clean up. Staff clean up time should not be included in listed store hours. That's just ludicrous."}
{"text":"I pity those who left bad reviews, explaining how bad of an experience they had. Funny, I've been here a couple of times on different time frames. Always satisfied with service, and on top of that the food is always good. It's good not amazing, but for the price I can't complain."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this Chinese dessert cafe, I was attracted by a picture of Hong Kong Style Steamed Rice Roll on the window outside.  The cafe gives out a chic vibe with black painted walls and black menus.  The place was packed, a good sign.  I looked at the menu and was surprised by the amount of varieties of desserts, drinks, snacks, and entrees they offer there.   I ordered Hong Kong Style Steamed Rice Roll and Stewed Egg White with Milk and Ginger, two of my favourite food.  The food came fast, and I was very pleased with both dishes.  The rice roll tasted freshly made, chewy but not mushy, drizzled with plenty of sweet sauce and sesame seeds.  The stewed Egg White was just the right amount of sweet with a hint of the ginger aroma, and the texture was so smooth and perfect.   This place does some authentic Chinese desserts.  I am hooked, and can't wait to visit again (and again) to taste whatever else they have to offer."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to any Sugar Marmalade. I've never been to any of the other locations. This one is pretty small. Luckily, when I arrived, there wasn't much of a wait.    Service was prompt and my glass of water was refilled several times without having to ask. I ordered the curry fish balls, Japanese popcorn chicken and Golden Sago Mixed. The curry fish balls were good, but spicy. The Japanese popcorn chicken was yummy, and I enjoyed the Golden Sago, which had a decent amount of mango - but a bit more would have been nice!   Overall, it was a positive experience and I would check it out again."}
{"text":"I heard about this place MONTHS ago via friend's pictures on Instagram. I have the biggest sweet tooth a person can have and when I heard about this place it was on my hit list. For the last couple of months I've been begging my boyfriend to take me to this place and finally I went yesterday! (This was a direct result of the long wait time that the Joey's Yorkdale gave me - 1.45 hrs!)   So my boyfriend drove to Sugar Marmalade and I was extremely excited. When I got there I didn't even know where to begin. With no prior tips from friends and without looking on Yelp my boyfriend and I began to pick items of the menu.   I got: Coconut Essence Jelly Drink, Popcorn chicken, Hong Kong style rice noodle and a House Special Jelly Mix dessert!   The Essence drink was really good! It is something I would definitely order again, same with the popcorn chicken and rice noodle, however, the jelly mix desert - although it was delicious - didn't really amaze me like the Essence drink did. It could possibly be due to the lychee boba that didn't go well with the other components of the dessert.   This was my first trip here, but it wont be the last. It was cute and a nice place for a date. The only problem I had was that there was one server and the poor girl was greeting everyone that was coming in, taking orders and serving in a restaurant with a capacity of 40 people. She did forget some of the original items that we ordered, but I completely understand. Other than that there wasn't any problems at all the food came out relatively quick.   This is a place you must try! ;)   -CL"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. My friend had recommended this restaurant after we had a meal in spandina. The atmosphere is very chill and the the waiters are nice. The dessertss are another topic though.. The fruits were raw both of the times I ate there, and the cheesecake looked it just came out of a package. Overall it's good for a chat with friends!"}
{"text":"One of those places to go to when the better dessert restos are closed. The staff are all young and not totally attentive. But all sincerely apologetic for forgetting to bring cutlery (twice. For both dishes...) or not noticing our drinks have been empty for a long time. Also, their menu is so extensive that if you come late at night, what you want might not be available for order.  We ordered the taro black glutinous rice with pearl delight and the Taiwanese minced beef with rice. The glutinous rice was quite good! Taro was soft, rice was cooked well. Balanced just right until the bottom of the dish after there was no more coconut milk.  The minced beef was not quite good. Or a little good. Not good at all. It didn't look good... I don't even want to re-live how it unappetizing it looked. The taste was mediocre. I strongly recommend against ordering it.  2 of the staff took a smoke break outside in front of the restaurant. Their cigarette smoke filtered through the vent and into the dining area.  Dessert was OK but it's gonna have to be a hard no."}
{"text":"Will give 2 stars now. Teriyaki fries seemed to improve and not too salty anymore. Plus anything with durian seems to taste good.   But stay away from egg waffles, it's hard & has rough texture. Not worth your bucks! Plus, FREE WIFI? It's a lie. DOESNT WORK AT ALL."}
{"text":"This place is......nah  Went because it was one of the only places in Mississauga open late for dessert, saw the waffle on yelp, went to try the waffle....server told us the waffle maker is \"broken\" so I had to opt for a tasteless \"mango pancake\" it was full of cream shit, and the \"pancake\" was as thin as 1-ply toilet paper that you can get for $0.50 at the supermarket.   Will not be going back and do not recommend."}
{"text":"A lot of selection for desserts and moderate selection for drinks. Ordered four desserts and a drink, all taste super sweet. We can't even finish it because of the high sugar level. The surrounding were so loud and noisy even tho there was no background music."}
{"text":"Many people have said good things about the mango pancake and shaved ice here so I thought I'd try it out.  The mango pancake was okay. The crepe itself lacked flavour and the filling wasn't great (just whipped cream and mango chunks).  My friend got the strawberry shaved ice, the portion was pretty big and it was sweet and sour, the good kind.   Service was not the greatest. They give you a piece of paper and make you write down your order. Theres a call button at each table but the servers wouldn't even attend to it.  Also, for my mango pancake, I wrote on the paper that I wanted it with black sesame ice cream, but they gave me vanilla instead.   I thought it was pretty pricey as well, considering it wasn't the best. ($7.49 for mango pancake, $8.99 for shaved ice)  Overall, it was okay. Not a place I'd want to go to often."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5 This place is located on Hwy 7 and Rodick Rd outside First Markham Place.   [SERVICE] - 2.5/5 Self-serve. We wrote down our own orders, the server brought us our food, and we pressed a button to request the bill. So, our server didn't really speak with us.    [DÉCOR] - 4/5  Modern, comfortable, good for dates or catching up with friends after dinner.   [QUALITY] - 3/5 Nothing spectacular, just an average spot for Chinese desserts.   [ORDER] - 2.5/5 - Strawberry Banana Pancake with Sundae Supreme - $7.49: a little pricey for the quantity. The pancake had too much of an egg taste and had a slippery texture that didn't complement the ice cream.   - Sweet Black Sesame Soup - $4.99: thick, rich, and nutty with the perfect amount of sweetness.   - Black Sesame Panna Cotta - $5.99: panna cotta was smooth, and black sesame ice cream was creamy. However, the corn flakes were too crunchy didn't pair well with the rest of the dessert.   [OVERALL] - 2.5/5 This place merely has good ambiance to hang out with your friends for hours and hours, but their food is just okay. Overall, I wouldn't particularly recommend Sugar Marmalade because of the drawbacks in their Pancake and Panna Cotta."}
{"text":"As others have noted, the desserts and prices are OK but the service is aloof and inexperienced. The overall impression is that they don't really care about customers. We were needlessly made to wait for a table and after much waiting without any information from the staff had to \"seize\" one that cleared up, otherwise we'd had to wait longer. The cashier messed up our bill.  However, this restaurant is the only place in Montreal at the moment that serves these kinds of desserts so they can afford to act as a monopoly and treat customers as a nuisance. Let's see how long this advantage lasts. The restaurant itself is very loud so try getting take out instead."}
{"text":"love the food so much. I believe that's the same taste as the dessert from Hong-Kong or mainland. Definitely, that's the best in Canada."}
{"text":"I got the Fresh Mango with Sago Mixed. Honestly, it was a great first few bites but overall the taste was average. Really wish I had gotten the fries instead - they looked AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Small place. We had to wait for a table for 3. There was a table of 2 available, and the waitress had the audacity to ask a couple to move there for us. We insisted we would wait.   Needless to say that couple didn't stay much longer.   Service here is non-existent. I literally had to flag down the waitress several times- most of the time looking like and idiot dancing at our table alone in attempts to get their attention.   They need to hire staff that can do their job. They give you a piece of paper to write your order on.  I'm assuming it has to do with the language. Ever other table was speaking Mandarin. We even had the girl come back and ask us what it was that we ordered...even though each item has a \"code\". Hmmm..  Food is mediocre, nothing special. Ordered the Japanese fries which arrived cold. They were drenched in mayo. Mango drinks had a weird, sour flavour to them.  With this type of service, I doubt they'll be in business much longer."}
{"text":"Really bad experience  Had to ask them for the menu for a couple of minutes(Despite everyone else getting them immediately). After which, we enjoyed a 50 minute wait for our dessert. The service didn't seem to be all there as then we also had to ask for our utensils. They ran out of regular silver spoons and gave us plastic ones instead. The food was not worth the wait. Afterwards we went up to pay, only to find out that their machine was broken and had to pay cash. Will not be coming back.  TLDR: Had to wait 50 mins for a husked out coconut. Service was abysmal and dessert was garbage."}
{"text":"Tldr: good variety of asian fusion desserts, good service, standard prices, would come back from time to time.   This location is pretty small just like the other one's, but they still offer the same wide selection of your favourite desserts. They also have snacks if you're feeling hungry or just something to munch on.  On my last visit, i ordered the special golden Soya bean jelly. I'm a huge fan of mango based desserts, and love soybean/tofu pudding (Doufuhua). So this was the first thing that caught my eye on the menu. The creamy mango base was nice and rich, and the sweetness was not too overpowering. The pudding was soft and smooth as well. Wasn't anything special, but wasn't bad either.   Service was good, and the waiters were pretty friendly. The place is relatively small so you might feel a little bit cramped, but i can see this place being somewhere that you can just chill with your friends. The prices for the desserts are standard as well. I'm not the type of person who usually craves desserts. However if my friends want to get their sweet tooth on, i wouldn't oppose to coming here."}
{"text":"Sugar Marmalade has a huge name but (at least at this location) it is a huge hit or miss.  My sister was so excited to show me this restaurant after eating their shaved ice downtown and she knew I heavily disliked Cha Me Cha's shaved ice and wanted to show me something different.  I gotta hand it to Sugar Marmalade ... their mango shaved ice was bomb.  Everything blended together so well and it came out so cute.  A definite must try.  Their drinks on the other hand .... the Special Mango drink (it's completely slipping my mind) but the one that's on the bottom of the page with a huge picture depicting what was in it.  It was so misleading as I thought the drink was thick enough to support the toppings, but it came out so freaking watery that I was basically drinking mango water.  The toppings actually tasted a little nasty... the popping boba was such a weird thing to add as it was so artificially sweet.  The lychee was suppose to add texture but it has 0 flavour.  Damn.  I got the steamed egg milk which came out like water at first .. but then the restaurant graciously remade it for me and it was okie domes (average).  We got take out food for my brother (baked salted chicken [this is a direct translation] rice) & he gave it a huge thumbs down.    Moral of the Review: Just come back for the shaved ice."}
{"text":"Ordered two tradition chinese sweet soup, papaya soup and pear soup.  We order them hot but it was like warm when they serve.  We ask them to reheat them but they questioned if we left it out for too long instead."}
{"text":"Great no frills place for some traditional and Asian fusion desserts. Don't come here with the expectation of amazing service, it's just your average Asian restaurant service.  I ordered the strawberry shaved ice and was praying that it wouldn't taste like the artificial strawberry flavour. Upon receiving it, I was pleasantly surprised!  The presentation was really cute and I liked how they gave a generous serving of condensed milk and strawberry jam on the side. The strawberry shaved ice is milky and not too sweet. The strawberry jam accompanying it gives it a subtle sourness that is more than a welcome addition. The vanilla ice cream on top was also a really nice touch, adding an extra hint of creaminess and milkiness to round out the flavours.  My boyfriend, as usual, ordered the Golden Sago Treasures which is his favourite. Nothing out of the blue here, although I would suggest avoiding the bubble tea and food. They're known for their desserts, so stick to that part of the menu. Things are generally hit or miss here."}
{"text":"Sugar! Yes please!   This is always a good place after eating on Yonge Street for some dessert. The prices are reasonable and there's a large selection of desserts and some snacks for those in your group that have a second stomach.   Whenever I visit this place, I like to try something new. My favourites have been the mango shaved ice (sweet cold dessert) or anything with gelatinous rice (delicious and chewy texture). The consistency is usually on point, and I really don't have many complaints.  The service is quick and friendly, but it can be tough to get seats at times. Hopefully you pick a good time to come or you could end up waiting for a while.   Out of all the things I tried, I'm not a big fan of the honeydew shaved ice. It tastes a little artificial and is the weaker of the shaved ice items."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my friend excited to try shaved ice for the first time. She arrived a bit before me and said there was a bit of a line but was seated by the time I arrived. I was surprised at how packed it was. There was a consistent line of people waiting to be seated. The servers we're extremely nice but the service was very slow and they don't check up on you. We assumed it was probably because how busy it was but they told us it's always that busy, even on school nights.  So be prepared for slow service.   We ordered deep fried lobster balls, taiwanese style popcorn chicken cartilages, teriyaki french fries, stewed beef brisket on rice, roasted cheese and garlic toast, condense milk toast, and mango taiwanese shaved ice.   Lobster balls: I would pass on these as they are definitely not lobster. They tasted more like imitation crab.   Popcorn chicken cartilages: they were good! Delicious batter and crunchy meaty interior. I think I would prefer the popcorn chicken but my friend really wanted to try the cartilages.  Teriyaki fries: were the biggest surprise of the night. They were topped with mayo, teriyaki sauce, sliced seaweed and katsuobushi (aka dried bonito flakes) which is dried skipjack tuna that moves as the heat rises from you meal. Making it appear like the bonito flakes are alive. They have a smokey flavour. I thought it tasted like smokey mackeral fish. Definitely something you must try. You can see the video on my ig @britanysbites  Stewed beef brisket on rice: not the best beef brisket I've had bur it was decent.  Unfortunately the portion of meat was small and there was a lot of cartilages and not enough meat.  The toast: not worth it. I've had better condense milk toast and the roasted cheese and garlic toast was simply garlic butter and cream cheese. Just not worth the room in your tummy.   Shaved ice: was a cool treat. I found that most of the flavour came from the mango syrup, mango chunks and jelly on top of the ice. Some of the mango was unripe and I didn't like the flavour jelly they chose but I would try it again. Perhaps the strawberry.    Overall there we're some hits and misses but menu is so extensive that I will be back to try more. Next time I will stop by in the day to see if it's less busy and the service improves."}
{"text":"No fuss, simple classic Taiwanese dessert food joint.  I'd recommend their Taiwanese popcorn chicken and mango sago dessert. Simple classic Taiwanese dessert. There's more, as I'm a fan of durian I tried their durian sago tonight... Still the mango sago tops the durian."}
{"text":"They recently opened across the street from my home :). Finally a quality HongKong dessert in MTL. This is the 2nd time that I ordered take out. I've tried 5 different things so car, the only problem is their dessert is not cold enough. It's still fairly new, I'm sure they will get better! Pictures are coming :)"}
{"text":"had japanese popcorn chicken. taiwanese popcorn chicken and japanese fries.  the japanese stuff was basically, takoyaki toppings. which is good. those toppings would be good on almost anything. the taiwanese popcorn chicken was the same thing without the toppings.  not somewhere i'd go out of my way to go to, but if it was local and convenient for me i could see myself frequenting it."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, both for take out. They are so slow and seem quite unorganized. I ordered the \"sweet soups\" and waited for over 20mins. Quite disappointed"}
{"text":"Came here a couple times and haven't been disappointed.  I always get the Japanese Style Curry Pork Chop on steamed rice and it never disappoints!  I've also tried their Mango sago mix with the vanilla ice cream in the middle and it was delicious!  I did not have a problem with the service as I don't really expect much with small places like these.  This place is comparable to Bubble Republic but I do believe it is much better and has more variety in food than Bubble Republic.  It's a great place to sit down and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"After a pretty big meal at Aka Japan next door, we wandered over to Sugar Marmalade to see if we wanted any dessert. I had sworn that was very very full and was not interested in dessert, but when the orders came through, i regretted not getting my own dish of mango pancake with ice cream.   It's literally mango and whipped cream wrapped in crepes topped with mango syrup and a ball of vanilla ice cream. It was so good. My mom and my aunt ordered some asian dessert thing with taro and little tapioca and what not and it was good, but i was focused on trying not to eat the entire mango pancake.  I've seen sugar marmalade all over town this winter trip back to Toronto, and didnt think much of it, but this location at FMP is quite clean and wonderful, and, well, mango pancake with ice cream made me very very happy."}
{"text":"I love this place! I definitely recommend getting the Japanese Popcorn Chicken over the Taiwanese. Also I like how the portions were larger here than any other snack place I've been to. Also friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ordered the SB8 (Durian Deluxe) for $7.99. I'm not usually a fan of durian-flavoured stuff (but like durian) but the picture showed chunks of durian so I thought I'd give it a try. It comes in a mason jar with the aiyo jelly, though it would've been nice if there were small chunks of durian instead. Sadly, the durian is only in the milk and not as shown in the picture. It was quite disappointing for someone who really likes durian. At around $10 total just for the drink, I want some damn durian =). The aiyo jelly gives you something to chew on but the after taste doesn't really fit with the drink. Again, if it was durian chunks it would've been much better. I've tried the First Markham Place location as well, and both haven't been great so I don't think I'll be going back to Sugar Marmalade any time soon."}
{"text":"I had quite a high expectation for this dessert place because they were saying that they offer authentic HK style dessert, but honestly it didn't meet up to my expectation, but really quite far from it. In fact, to be fair, their dessert is not bad but the non dessert is just... awful. I tried their curry pork rice, and seriously I felt like it was the worst curry I have ever tried. The dessert I tried was the black sticky rice and taro in coconut milk, at first I liked it but soon I found it bland. My friend took pomelo and mango with grass jelly, The mango was not sweet at all! I was really disappointed by the quality of food here."}
{"text":"Yelp had some terrible reviews, but I thought I'd give it a chance anyway. Turns out, the terrible reviews were on point! It wasn't busy when we were there. There was a guy and a girl working. We wrote our order on the sheet they gave us and also circled the answers to the questions on the order sheet. They were \"same bill or separate?\", \"dessert at the same time or after food?\". We said same bill, and dessert after. We ordered curry fish balls, popcorn chicken, sweet red bean soup, rice noodle rolls, and for dessert, egg waffle with ice cream and shaved ice. The curry fish balls came out first, we finished and then the popcorn chicken came out. We finished that too. Waited a good 10-15 minutes after we were finished only to realize it looks like they forgot the rest of our order. So I called the guy over and asked what happened to the rest of our food, he looks puzzled, goes and checks. Comes back and asks me again what the problem is, i explain again and he comes back in 5 minutes with the egg waffle ice cream dessert. I said, we didn't even get 2 of our snack foods and you're already giving us the dessert? I asked to have the dessert after the food. He looks puzzled and asks so do you not want this? Pointing to the egg waffle. I said no that's fine. We'll keep it. Don't wanna waste it. Please bring the food though. Then 5 minutes later, comes back with all three: shaved ice, rice noodle roll, and the red bean soup. To top it off, all of the food was mediocre, even the dessert and drink (i forgot to mention i also ordered a slush with some sort of jelly, but it tasted like apple juice with apple sauce thrown in; where was the jelly and the slush?). Needless to say, I did not tip. They're lucky that I even paid for everything after our terrible time here. I WILL NEVER BE GOING BACK NOR WILL I EVE BE RECOMMENDING THIS PLACE TO ANYONE."}
{"text":"First time coming here with my friend, this location is conveniently located from Kenzo ramen, about 200 meters away. We both decided to try out their parfait - we both wanted the green tea ice cream (instead of the chocolate or black sesame) option so they were kind to accommodate that! It was delicious - the green tea ice cream was delicious. It was interesting how they had cereal at the bottom, it tasted pretty good as a combination with the other ingredients though. About $7 for each. It was a good atmosphere as well, good service, would come back to try out their entree and bubble tea next time! :)"}
{"text":"Came here late at night with some friends and it was very small, and crowded. But the space looked really cute.  They mostly had desserts that looked really good, but also had some meals. I tried the taiwanese popcorn chicken on rice. It was good, a bit average, but I heard the japanese popcorn chicken was better.  Also cash only!!!"}
{"text":"I think Sugar Marmalade is just one of those over hyped places that simply cannot meet the expectations I had. So before I came in, my friends told me this restaurant is super good, best desserts, and that it was worth the wait (1 hour to get a seated place). I went on a not so busy day, ordered the mixed fruits with Sago mixed and pearl delight, with a golden royal drink, while my friend ordered the fresh strawberry with pearl delight. I also ordered their popcorn chicken with rice to go.  Basically, the 2 desserts and the drink were disapointing. The mixed fruits sago dish was OK at most, I do not know if they use frozen watermelons, but while eating the watermelon, I hurt my teeth while crunching on something very hard. Taste was correct, not really sweet or anything, the fruits just tasted what they were supposed to taste, but I do not feel that the different fruits and elements of the dish worked well together. I thought the same of the strawberry version. I also did not really like the drink, the bubbles were, I think, yogurt popping bubbles, and I just do not like those, so my opinion is biased. Except from that, the drink was okay, not really sweet or anything.  The popcorn chicken with rice was pretty good and satisfying."}
{"text":"Good dessert place that offers food and bubble. Came in once 45 mins before closing but they wouldn't let us sit down."}
{"text":"Sugar Marmalade opens at FMP! Now another option for some late night dessert and snack. The interior is nicely decorated and I love the varieties of dessert they offers. And quite a few Durian dessert too.  Mango Pomelo Dessert ($5.99) was quite good especially when mango was in season! Portion is on the smaller side.  There is a Call/Service Button on the table if you want to request for service.  If you love durian, then you would enjoy their well prepared durian desserts. The Swiss Chicken Wings ($6.49) we ordered was a big disappointment though with just 4 wingettes. I might just skip the hot food.....  3 Star for now, but I would be back to have some more dessert!"}
{"text":"0.5 Star for free parking at the back lot 0.5 Star for the free wifi and the waitress did give me the password 0.5 Star for the free water and the menu  But we were left sitting there reading the menu, drinking our water, playing with my phone for over 10 minutes... I felt invisible, I felt helpless, I felt no one even see me when I tried to get the wait staff's attention?!   So we drank our water and use the washroom... and walked out without even able to order and taste the food that Sugar Marmalade offers.   We walked out and even no one noticed? Maybe I am really invisible..."}
{"text":"This Sugar Marmalade is small and busy. It was packed on a Friday afternoon around 3 pm when I dropped by. I would go somewhere else on weekend as this is not worth the wait for more than 10 minute.  Menu is identical to other locations. I always love all the choices and their specials which are seasonal. Making a choice what to order can be quite a challenge. But I suggest if you are in a rush and the restaurant looks busy, do yourself a favor, order something that has component that is simple and could be put together quickly. The wait for cooked food/or cooked when order can be long.  I usually order something with Durian inside. Durian with Black Glutinous Rice ($6.99) Though the portion is small but tasted so good.  Will return if the place is not busy."}
{"text":"It was okay having one desert store opens till very late at night. The dessert and the main course were just okay."}
{"text":"J'ai fait l'erreur d'écouter les recommandations de 2 amis au détruiement de la note Yelp qui était déjà mauvaise (autour de 3/5).  Je ne pense pas revenir dans cet endroit à moins qu'un changement radical n'arrive dans le management et la qualité.  Service pitoyable et inexpérimenté qui enchaine erreurs et carrement mauvaise attitude parfois. Rapide mais pas attentif du tout. Se trompent de commandes, dans les factures et incapables de nous prévenir que ce que l'on commande est un plat pour 4 personnes (facile).  Je dirais que la femme qui a l'air d'être la gérante qui fait l'acceuil pourrait faire un effort pour son haleine.  Les desserts sont jolis mais clairement la qualité des ingrédients est au ras des paquerettes. Étant un fan de bouffe asiatique, de desserts chinois et taiwanais je dirais que ça ne goute rien de spécial voir que c'est tout simplement mauvais, comme par exemple ces crêpes aux mangues dont la crême fouettée goutte la crême la plus cheap que l'on peut acheter en supermarché = archi dégueulasse.  Concernant la taro dans le lait de coco, mon amie vietnamienne a trouvé ça mauvais et m'a garantie qu'elle pouvait faire mieux avec des ingrédients achetés en supermarché.  La musique choisie est vraiment répulsive. Probabalement de la mauvaise kpop a haut volume. Si on début on pouvait s'entendre correctement, après un certain temps ils augmentent le volume et il faut alors parler assez fort pour pouvoir se comprendre dans une discussion.  C'est bruyant et bondé. Oubliez cet endroit si vous voulez être au calme.  J'aurais encore plus de mauvais commebtaires à faire mais je pense que vpus devriez déjà être prévenus : vous allez être très déçus !"}
{"text":"Be ready to wait in line, I live nearby and the place is always packed.  They mostly offer desserts but you also have snacks.   Popcorn chicken is a must, in Japanese or Taiwanese style.  One thing to be aware, ive been there two times and the invoice was wrong each time, and not at my advantage."}
{"text":"I come here whenever my friends and I are craving any sort of desserts because they have a very interesting menu. Their desserts menu has an extensive selection of fruits, my favourite being any dish the has mango in it.   The drinks at Sugar Marmalade are also very unique and diffuse a lot of different flavours together. I love getting their lychee drinks because it actually has the fruit in it and who doesn't love some juiced up fruits to eat after finishing their drinks. I also highly recommend everyone to get the Japanese style popcorn chicken because it is very well put together and totally satisfies those midnight cravings.   Sugar marmalade is one of my go to dessert places since it is reasonably priced but I do suggest calling before you go because they do tend to be very busy at times."}
{"text":"Service was better than some of the people commented on here. I got the mango sundae supreme crepes, my boyfriend for banana strawberry supreme crepes, we shared mixed sweet dumplings and the mango (under speciality drinks). I am not complaining about the food except for the mixed sweet dumplings, 2 out of 5 of the dumplings tasted bad (one was too savory for my liking and another one tasted like burnt charcoal).  One part I found unprofessional was that debit card machine was down for the day (we went at 7PM today) and the vicinity iPad wifi was down for the day (actually almost all the time). Not only I didn't get my points for vicinity, I had to walk to TD to get cash because there's no ATM nearby.  I am not complaining about this place but there are things that needs to be tweaked out....More like they need to get their professional shit together."}
{"text":"My favorite Hong Kong dessert restaurant so far. We ordered a durian pancake, a durian with black glutinous rice and a mango sago. The pancake is filled with whipped cream. I can barely taste the durian within. 3/5. But the other two desserts are amazing. Both 5/5. Definitely would go back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"It's a great place to hang out with friends.  It certainly produces instagram-worthy shots.  Taste-wise, it's not spectacular, but I do love their Taiwanese chicken and beef brisket with rice meals.  Do I crave their food?  Sometimes.  But the durian--ANYTHING durian--never again!  One whiff or sip or bite=Instant headache.  Friendly staff.  It's a fun concept and they offer a lot of dessert options.  Kimchi fries are just fries with kimchi on top LOL.  But this restaurant is worth a try."}
{"text":"Sugar Marmalade is a nice little Taiwanese dessert place I stopped into on a Saturday night. The menu has a large assortment of dessert options (including one of my favourites: shaved ice), as well as the usual tea and appetizer options.   I had a sort of \"everything together\" mango and yogurt based dessert with ice cream. It tastes good, but the did something curious: they put this cold dessert in a bowl that just came out of the dishwasher. So it melted really fast and was hard to enjoy; though it was good for the two minutes before it got really soupy.   I also had a mango oblong tea which was good, though a but too sweet.   The popcorn chicken my friend and I shared was great, right amount of salty.   The service was good, and I'm eager to try the other desserts on the menu. I also found their options to be reasonably priced: my dessert was $6.99, which is pretty good."}
{"text":"Finally a first time here for dessert. I like the decor and extensive menu. Like their menu layout with bold photos, price are decent and good potion.  As for the taste, it wasn't a bomb but it sure helps the sweet craves.  Will come back again for other salty dishes."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Sugar Marmalade, we usually go next door to Chat Time when we need a sweet fix. The menu is extensive, whether you are craving dessert or dinner there is something for everyone. The fried chicken was pretty good, and the mango sago dessert had a lot of flavor. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Cold chilly day looking to get some hot dessert. Went here before, I remember it being ok. This time it was pretty bad. Got some hot almond and sesame soup, it wasn't hot at all. The top was cold and bottom was just warm, flavor and texture was just o.k.  Also go at Red bean soup  w/ Grass jelly. Red bean wasn't that good, quite watery. Service was really really slow. Took 3-4 times to ring the table bell before they came. As we were leaving we noticed in the back they have 4-5 microwaves, and  they just heat most of their hot desserts in plastic containers."}
{"text":"Another long and awaited review . I  have been  to Sugar Marmalade  five times. Once   alone to the Spadina location while waiting for  some book I ordered , Three times   dined in with friends  , and  one time takeout  last year  If you love Asian  desserts /entrees/ snacks  then you have come to the right place. The food is quite tasty . The experience  here is  HIT or MISS for most people. My experiences  with friends have always been hits.Here is  my strategy   below so that every visit of yours will be a HIT and will result in repeats.   STRATEGY (1) Check their menu from their website http://www.sugarmarmalade.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sugar_takeout.pdf (2) Go through the menu section by section:   Ideally you want to try the most appealing  dish or two from each section for the best experience.   (3)  Write down the letter and number code of what you want on a piece of paper (4)  Plan to be there 30 minutes before your intended time  as there is always a wait . Bring your debit card or some cash because they do not take  accept credit (5)  List the  letter-number code and the quantity (6)   Unless you  plan on having a nice chill session with your friends, do takeout. The waiting time is about 15-20 minutes  which means more time to socialize with you friends, admire the beautiful quotes about desserts on the walls (7)  They do not do separate bills so either put in cash with your friend, or plan to have one person pay by debit and you pay them after  Follow these and your experience will be great.  What to Order ?   Here are my suggestions below. I have eaten , drunk and enjoyed every one of them and I feel you will too. I picked desserts , drinks,  food based on hitting as many categories as possible  with a dish . I highly recommend them.   Fusion Desserts:    Aim to try one of each of the fusion desserts. So far I have  had  Golden Sago Mixed w Sweet Coconut Noodles Durian Mochi Deluxe: Its good, and  tastes really  nice .  Has a slightly unusual smell but its nothing to worry about Traditional Puddings: I  skipped this section because  I believe in getting value for my money . I recommend  the Chinese Pudding Platter which is under the' Traditional Pudding' Section and has an assortment of puddings which I feel lets u sample a bit of them all.  Black Glutinous  Rice Desserts: , Black Glutinous Rice with Toddy Palm Seeds , Taro Black Glutinous Rice with Pearl Delight Soya Bean Desserts: Fresh Mango with Soya Bean Jelly Black Pearl Desserts: Lychee Black Pearl Delight Sago Mixed Desserts: Golden Sago Mixed, House Special Sago Mixed with Mango &  Watermelon Juice Special Beverages: Try every one of them as they are  so good. So far I have tried  Golden Royal Drink,  Apple Pommelo Drink. Appetizers: Taiwanese Style  Popcorn Chicken,  Hongkong Style Deep Fried Calamari.  Next On  My  List: I  have not tried these but based on examining the menu for uniqueness I have got them  on my list. These are my personal choices and u do not have to follow them .  But if u are into trying out the unique, then I  highly recommend  you do so.  Stewed Desserts :, Stewed Papaya with White Fungus  Sweet Soup ,Stewed Pear , Stewed Pear with Chuan Bei and Snow Fungus Sweet Soup Sweet Dumplings: Mixed Assorted Sweet Dumplings since it will  let u sample a bit of each dumpling . Traditional Soup:  Planning to try all of them Appetizers: Black Pepper Chicken Wings, Chicken Bean Curd Rolls, Chicken Cartilages,Yam Fries.. The rest of them seem rather basic. Sago Mixed Desserts: Coconut Milk  &  Toddy Palm Seeds with Sago   ,Golden Treasures Mixed Soya Bean Desserts: Sweet Almond Soup with Soya Bean  Jelly , Sweet Sesame Soup with Soya Bean  Jelly  Black Grass Jelly Desserts:  House Special Black Grass Jelly Mixed Traditional Desserts : Sweet Sesame Soup  & Almond Soup Mixed   Not On My List:   Skipping these because I do not see any  improvement in my experience from having these  in proportion to what I would spend Traditional Pudding Section:  Just get the platter Cheesecakes: You can get better elsewhwere Taiwanese Shaved Ice:  Not paying for shaved ice Toasts: Not my thing  BlackTea,Green Tea, Oolong Tea Milk Teas  Smoothie/Iced Coffee Entrees   Hope u have a gr8 time at Sugar Marmalade"}
{"text":"Nice light desserts . Any dessert with mango is good. Only drawback is you have to pay with cash they don't accept credit cards. But it is a nice place and has variety of dessert."}
{"text":"Me and my friends love coming here for snacks and desserts. great chill place but it does get busy during Friday nights. They have a wide selection so you'll find something g for everyone"}
{"text":"Came here for dessert and I love the wall they have inside the place.  It's pretty instagram worthy.  As for the dessert I had the matcha panna cotta minus the red beans.  I like how it's not too sweet and just enough to fill the sweet tooth crave.  They do have a big selection of desserts and hot food too."}
{"text":"I've been twice so far and I have to say that the service is quite slow. This is partly due to the fact that many of their tables seat four people and can't be split up to accommodate the multiple couples who walk in. Thus many tables are half empty while the line extends to the door. Also, the kitchen is rather slow. Between the time that we are seated and receive the food, it is an extremely long wait. If the kitchen were more efficient, the turnover would be a lot faster.   As for the food, the dinner courses are just ok, they are a little bit on the salty side. We had a matcha shaved ice and it was humongous. It was also exceedingly sweet and therefore tough to finish  even if we shared it. Our favorite was the golden royal drink. The popping yogurt bubbles surprise you with a bit of freshness as they burst in your mouth. We were told that the mango sago is also pretty good."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  If it's your first time at Sugar Marmalade, I would recommend the golden sago mixed or the golden treasures mixed, mango roll supreme or the green tea and red bean Taiwanese shaved ice!  I've been here a couple times already and I try to change it up with what I order. This time we ordered the taro sago mixed with pearl delight, the strawberry and lime Italian soda and the special mango drink. I thought the dessert and drinks were alright. It didn't particularly wow me but it also didn't taste bad. I find sugar marmalade is mixed in the good and so-so offerings. It tastes very typical and I can't really point out what was particularly good about these orders.   LAST TIP?  Bring cash or a debit card because they don't accept credit card. Try the recommendations I mentioned above if you are looking for suggestions and maybe you can also look into their savoury options too because they're not that expensive either!"}
{"text":"This place is the best in the area for deserts and drinks. It is always packed and rightfully so. I have tried their brick toast, mango puddings and other deserts. Everything is great quality and satisfying."}
{"text":"If you are in the area or at vaughan mills and craving some desert,finger foods, and entrees then you should come here. I ordered Taiwanese style popcorn chicken, Japanese teriyaki fries, and Taiwanese style minced pork with rice. Food was fresh and they all tasted awesome. Place is kinda small so seats are limited."}
{"text":"Note: I visited this location while their servers were still in training. My server was extremely quiet and struggled to understand how to split the bill. We were told the waffles would take 15min and they came out very hard and overdone. I prefer for my dessert waffles to be soft and fluffy. However, my matcha ice cream and toppings were delicious. It's only been two days and I'm already craving to go back. With the frigid temperatures the door was making the restaurant chilly but servers would rush to open the door for you and close it immediately which helps. Although the waffles took awhile other orders were quick and service was attentive. I love when restaurants have a call button. I'm giving 4 stars considering servers and cooks are new. On my next visit I will make sure to ask for a soft waffle.  I didn't order any hot foods but my friends Korean fried chicken was a fair portion size and tasted authentic."}
{"text":"Mmm this place is a decent place to grab a bite, drinks or dessert. A huge pro is that this place is opened till pretty late but it gets really busy so it's hard to find a table - especially if you have a big group of people. I've been here a few times and never sure of what I want to order. The Japanese fries and popcorn chicken here taste pretty good. I ordered Cheung fun for the first time and I'm surprised that it tasted pretty good. Soy sauce/salt could be reduced a little bit and have more peanut sauce on it (bomb sauce). This was a pretty big portion for me and I couldn't finish it (only thing I got so after a while I guess the taste for boring?). I got a honey green tea cold drink and it tasted alright. Wish it was a little sweeter.   The ordering of serving was really weird. Someone had ordered dessert and a meal. They brought out the dessert first.. before the meal? We asked them to take it back and bring it out after the meal was done.   I prob wouldn't plan to come here unless a group wanted to and it's a little bit more on the pricy side. There are other Taiwanese joints I would rather go to."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place for bubble tea. The bubble tea here is overpriced for the size. The drinks are not cold. They serve their drinks lukewarm or cool so it's not refreshing at all. It's so bad that even their own employees don't order drinks from here.   Desserts are alright though.   Service here is not that great either. They ran out of one of the things we ordered on the menu and just took it off our bill but didn't tell us. We sat there waiting for so long and we were informed after we asked them that they ran out..."}
{"text":"If the service was as good as the food, this would easily be a four star restaurant. This was not the case, Id rather get dragged off a United Airlines flight than have my night dragged on for 30 more minutes waiting for the waitress to take my bill. Solid 3/5. If it weren't for the company of my cute date it would have been a 2/5."}
{"text":"They now have changed their menu, removing some drinks and adding more entree and savoury items! Loving the new change as it sets them apart from Green Grotto and Chatime nearby. Some prices have gone up though. Service is a little faster with the bell attached to the tables"}
{"text":"It was a chilly evening and wanted something sweet and warm.  My sister and I walked into this place for the first time.  The menu has several options, hot and cold.  Ice cream, crepes, traditional asian sweets and some creative fusion desserts.   We had the coconut sago with taro.  Its tasted great but was not very hot.   We also has mixed glutinous balls filled with black sesame, red bean, white sesame and durian.     They were in a coconut milk.  Loved it!  Looking forward to returning.  I want to try their dinner items too.  Popcorn chicken is there signature dish."}
{"text":"prepare to have a hard time selecting what you want.  I find the portions to be generous if you are getting the chinese soupy type of desserts.  The square bowl it comes in was bigger than i expected.   They ran out of the papaya stew milk the day i went ... so i opted for the crepe.. i wouldn't get it again.. whipped creme is wrapped with a thin crepe (not the freshly made ones).  and a scoop of icecream and a bit of strawberries and banana on the side.  i think it was 6.99.   I much rather get the HK waffle with icecream next time.  would come back to try other desserts though.."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Do not order any rice dishes. They do not look like the picture. Absolutely horrendous, desserts were decent. Very watered down and small."}
{"text":"* fancy, fusion desserts!  * Puddings, pearls, sago, taro * Open until 1:00am!  * Conveniently located along Burnhamthorpe west"}
{"text":"Did not realize this is a chain. What got me was the black sesame icecream that was available and those yogurt popping balls. You get a good size and there are a lot of interesting stuff.  The black sesame icecream didn't seem to go with my mango fruity choice but separately it tasted good. I like the different textures and mild sweetness and that extra citrus pop.  Great place to try new and interesting flavors with some real fruit that's not overly packed with sugar.  I'd be interested in coming back to this place to try more.  Very friendly and helpful staff as well and did not feel rushed.  Since it is a chain, I may try their downtown location... Not so sure why the low ratings but they are higher in my books."}
{"text":"We had the pink lady drink and a hazelnut brick toast. The drink was great but a bit on the small side and the toast was also a bit small. Not the greatest value but good none the less"}
{"text":"SUMMARY: I've been to Sugar Marmalade numerous times and to different locations and I've never been overly impressed by their desserts. I usually go just for convenience and because it's open late! Another great thing about Sugar Marmalade is that they have tons of options for desserts and food. But I would say not to have too high of expectations.  MY MEAL: Dish: Grean Tea Parfait - Green tea ice cream with strawberries, strawberry pockey, corn flakes yogurt and whip cream.  Review: It's a very light and airy dessert. Not too heavy and not too filling. It's perfect for someone like me who's looking for a quick dessert that isn't too sweet! I have had better Taiwanese desserts but I still do come back from time to time if I'm craving some desserts in my local area! I find that I go to Sugar Marmalade more for convenience, and not because I love it that much."}
{"text":"Sugar Marmalade offers decent dessert options yet a bit lacklustre experience in other departments. I went there with my Taiwanese friend on a Tuesday afternoon  and it wasn't too busy. I ordered the traditional  pudding with dried longan while he had  the steamed pudding. I also got the three cup chicken. And the waitress didn't tell us they don't have the steamed pudding until they brought my food. Luckily, it only took 10 minutes for the replacement to arrive. The traditional pudding was nice, lightly sweet with a touch of camomile. My personal preference would be a softer pudding. The  chicken is unimpressive, borderline unenjoyable. The dish is definitely not freshly made. The chicken has dried out from sitting in the sauce for too long. Sauce is salty, lacking in both flavours and depth due to the absence of ginger and fresh basil. The rice was mediocre and a bit too dry/tough. It comes with eggs and tomato which is a cloying sweet mess.  The cashier also messed up our bills multiple times render the entire thing less than thrilling.  Pros: decent and plentiful desserts, fast service.  Cons: incompetent staffs, médiocre savoury options"}
{"text":"I love the fact that markham opened a sugar marmalade. Now I don't have to hike downtown for my favourite mango drink. For what it's worth, it's good desserts for cheap prices, and service isn't bad either. Only difficulty is how busy it gets and with the little seats it has to offer, going in big groups might not be a good idea unless you're going before the evening hours. This location also does NOT offer delivery.  Now for the food:  - popcorn chicken (8.49): a little too oily for my liking, too much salt and not worth the price honestly - deep fried calamari (6.49): yikes. Avoid at all times, it's so oily and dry to the taste. - ice cream chocolate waffles (5.99 I think?): I can't remember seeing this at fmp location but I ordered it in the downtown location. It's big enough to fill one person, mediocre, and nothing special.  - golden royal drink (5.49): so good, it's honestly the drink that keeps me coming back. I love the popping yogurt balls, such a nice treat. Comes in a cup.  - golden sago mixed (5.99): the dish version of the drink version, except it's 50 cents more, without the popping yogurt balls but comes with ice cream - golden treasures mixed (6.99): basically the golden royal drink but with ice cream and sprinkles of grapefruit. Get the drink, it's more worth it - strawberry shaved ice (6.49): when I got this the first time it was 4.99, but they've jacked up the price since a few years ago. It's still not a bad price, because servings are rather big, and taste isn't just the super artificial strawberry kind either, but I'd still rather spend a dollar more at Tracy's next door for their shaved ice instead.  Verdict: definitely returning for their drinks. Food is just so-so, but their drinks are definitely worth going for!"}
{"text":"No service. The waitress pushed the foods of last guests to my friend's legs. The foods were served on the edge of the table, she didn't even bother to put in front of the right person. Wrong order. Why do we queue for a hour anyway?  Asian restaurants these days near downtown are spoiled.  ????????????????"}
{"text":"I wouldn't be the first one to suggest Sugar Marmalade but I wouldn't turn it down if my friends wanted to go. I don't think there's anything that makes them unique or sets them apart from other dessert places. I've tried a couple of things on the menu but none are particularly good or stand out in my mind other than:  Japanese Teriyaki Fries ($6.99) - Not enough sauce. It's just regular fries after you finish the top layer. Still good and very crispy. I'd order this again but would ask for more sauce.   Marshmallow Toast ($6.49) - Definitely need to share this unless you have a major sweet tooth. One bite was enough for me!  We must've ordered 4+ things to share but we weren't given any side plates/bowls until we asked.  On another occasion, I ordered a Green Tea Egg Waffle but it was meh. I love egg waffles but I wouldn't order any of the egg waffles desserts again - that's how underwhelming it was.   As someone that doesn't carry cash, I dislike that cash is their only accepted form of payment in this day and age. In case you decide to share, be aware that they also have a minimum spending of $4.99/person."}
{"text":"Wonderful dessert place with an amazing selection of different sweets. And the food that comes out looks just as good as the pictures.   We had the black glutinous rice with fruit, the green tea shaved ice, and the mini waffles with green tea ice cream and red beans. All were delicious. A must go to again place."}
{"text":"Good place to enjoy dessert or sweeties. They open until 2pm. The price are reasonable. They accept cash only, but have an ATM by the entrance."}
{"text":"Not all locations of Sugar Marmalade were created equal, and this particular one is the best. They do a great job at classic Chinese desserts (especially their steamed milk and steamed egg, and their black rice pudding) as well as Taiwanese savoury dishes. I love their braised pork over rice (???) and their braised beef noodle soup is pretty solid, too. I also love their Taiwanese popcorn chicken.They offer fun drinks and new school desserts as well, such as crepes, toasts, millefeuilles and bubble waffle platters. Their Italian sodas are very refreshing. Also, this place is staffed with very sweet ladies. This is a good place to go for Taiwanese food and Chinese dessert fans!"}
{"text":"I have to give a two star review because it was a disappointing experience. Although I went to 2 other locations in toronto which were good but this is the worst among those three.   We ordered Japanese fries and popcorn chicken and they were Extremely salty!!! Seriously the sauce on those two dishes was horrible and we didn't finish them at the end. Unlike the other authentic Taiwanese or Japanese restaurants, the fried chicken and fries were not good enough. The dessert was okay and fresh. We also ordered Apple juice and kiwi lemon juice. I tried both but the mixture of Kiwi + lemon was a bit weird to me so I didn't like it that much. So we were kept asking for more water cuz the food was so salty and dry.   The place was cozy and busy, also easy to park."}
{"text":"Always loved their snacks. Lots of fried stuff but really yummy. The desserts aren't as good as some other places but for uptown it's great. My friends loved the durian pancakes. I do not eat durian therefore will take their words for it. One downside to this is you would leave this place smelling like grease. Always hate that but keeps coming back for those snacks."}
{"text":"Three stars is generous for the service that was provided here. The service was extremely slow and inefficient. It took almost an hour just to get desserts to us not including the time it took for the food. The presentation of the food I ordered was less than satisfactory. I ordered the Japanese curry and it look like microwaveable frozen food and not to mention it tasted very bland.  Not all things were negative though. The dessert tasted pretty good although due to the slow service, the ice cream in my dessert melted a little too much.  If they could just make the service more efficient, I would definitely come here more for strictly dessert."}
{"text":"We ordered the durian supreme and an italian lychee soda.  The food was good but the service was terrible.  It took over 30 minutes for the dessert to come and over 40 minutes for the italian soda,  which is unacceptable.  Decent food but very slow service"}
{"text":"This is a great Chinese dessert place.  Good variety ranging from shaved iced ( mango, green tea served in cold stone bowl , topped with ice cream n mango bits), fresh fruit served in different bases such as tapioca, crepes, parfaits and bubble tea.  Traditional Hong Kong style entrees like chicken wings , pop corn chicken , beef brisket served on rice and soups.  Single waitress with light green dyed hair seems not the most friendly but took our order and served us fast.  We had the the popcorn chicken served on rice  Mango shaved ice House special grass jelly n tapioca  Water came without asking.  $26.52 with tax.  Only cash or debt."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times each time gets worse. The last time we went there we were served ice cold wings, we told them that it's cold.. The plate returned heated up. The menu looks really nice but it's deceiving because it's not worth the price to be served cold food reheated up."}
{"text":"Good for snacks and desserts, really like their kimchi fries and green tea shaved ice. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is opened until 1am daily and until 2am on Saturdays.  It's your typical young Asian crowd so the food is more like snacks rather than full meals, although there are a couple of rice and noodle dishes.  Their kimchi and Japanese teriyaki fries with seaweed and mayo on it is quite tasty and a generous portion.    People come here mainly as a dessert place.  They have a huge selection of bubble tea and Asian desserts consisting of many mango dessert dishes, matcha ice cream, sesame and coconut combos too.  I would not suggest the fruit crepes as the insides are not fruit filled but rather just full of tasteless cream.  Not what you would expect in a fruit crepe.  It would be nice if they had more fruit inside the crepe or perhaps a better and more appetizing filling.    This place can get very crowded and very often has a line up to get in especially during the evening hours when people just want to hang out over dessert and snacks.  There is a system used there where when you arrive, you write your name down on the list with the number of people in your party.  They will then call you when a table comes available.    The vibe in the cafe is lively, noise level like that of a busy Starbucks and tables are small and cosy.  We do like to come here especially when you feel peckish and want a casual place to chat with friends."}
{"text":"More than just a dessert place! They also have food!  Location:  In the outbuildings of Vaughan Mills. Visit Vaughan Mills then stop in for something to eat  Parking: Not so bad if you come at night! But daytime can be a bit busy because this area is full of restaurants and bbt places!!  Decor: Booths and tables with chairs. It's a pretty nice space. Smallish but not so bad. You feel comfortable, like they want you there! Oh, and the best thing ever. Buzzers on the tables so you can get the servers attention!  Food:  I thought it was just a dessert place but it's not! They have rice rolls, rice dishes, fries, popcorn chicken etc.   I liked the rice rolls but others at the table thought they were too dense. Oh I tried my first toast dessert. Sweet and good, everything I thought it would be.  Popcorn chicken was a table favourite as was the kimchi French fries!   Not bad! The drinks are great too!   I love the Italian sodas! There's a lot of flavours to choose from. I recommend their lychee one. Yummm  Staff: Everyone is nice!  See you there"}
{"text":"Lets see where do I start? Food, Service, or Price? Either way it's only a 2 star resturant at best.  Food - The food is far from its east end counter part. The food is bland, no taste, and under cooked. Walking in you can already tell from the left over partially full dishes previous patrons have left (not only food but full plates of desert). Ordered the Cheesy Japanese Curry Baked Rice as well as the Unagi Cheesy Baked Rice. Both were equally horrible tasteless lack of sauce dry and worst of all the Unagi is NOT fresh and tastes funny, never eaten chewy unagi before with a wierd fishy plastic taste. The rice was under cooked and hard. We also ordered the hk style rice noodles which were again undercooked and the hoisin and peanut sauces were so watered down they had no taste nor did it stick to the rice noodles. Talk about skimping. To top it off the size of their bowls/plates are 20% smaller which hardly makes up for the price.  Price - This brings me to the price. The size of the bowls are 20% smaller yet the pricing at this place is almost 30% more expensive! $9 for a similar type of baked rice dish anywhere in the east end they are selling for $12 in a 20% smaller size. IF it tasted good I could justify but not in this case. On top of it all the resturant is cash only *facepalm* I wonder why.. *rolls eyes*. $9 for a bowl of hk style sweet tofu desert LOL what does it have in there gold on flakes? The same desert is under $5 in the east end. For 2 people we ended up with a $40 bill ordering only 2 rice dishes and an appetizer leaving unsatisfied and still hungry.   Service - While the waitresses are really nice the service in food delivery is extremely slow. You would think that for the amount of time it takes for them to spit out food it would be properly cooked no.. Rice is under cooked and stuff just tastes bland. Total wait time for appetizer was 25min and then an additional 10minutes for each of the baked rice."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place but every time I come here there is about a 10-20 minute wait depending on the time of day, especially in the evening. My friend and I came here on a Friday night and it was quite packed but we lucked out and was able to get a table within 5 minutes.  We got the assorted sweet dumplings in a coconut milk base. The dumplings had different fillings such as peanut, sesame, mango, durian, and red bean. These were cooked well and had good flavours. We also got the mango roll supreme which was essentially a crepe with lots of whipped cream and a mango filling topped with a mango drizzle and a scoop of ice cream. I liked the concept of this crepe thing but there was way too much whipped cream.  I love this place for Asian desserts. The desserts are good and not expensive at all."}
{"text":"OK, so today I went for take out and ordered the durian rice roll.   I'm watching the guy at the counter make my dessert.   I see him put the durian on then lick the excess durian of his fingers and continue on. I tell the waitress I don't want that one,  the guy just licked his fingers and touched the rice roll.   she goes tell the guy to make another, once again did not wash his hands,  I pointed it out to the waitress, so after 2 attempts the guy finally washed his hands.   I mentioned to her you might want to let management know,  but she seemed kind of lost, hence I'm posting this here.   I usually enjoy this place but after watching them make my dessert I'm a bit turned off by this place now"}
{"text":"Waited over 40 minutes for an order they forgot about. Their method of getting orders, is really strange and is really easy to get lost in translation. The aesthetic is appealing, but the inconvenience is not. They ended up getting the order wrong too. It's also only cash, which I find very strange in an increasingly technological world, where a business' best idea would not be to be 'cash-only'. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I can't believe their Swiss chicken wings are soooooo hoorible, they are over boiled and so salty. Everyone know how to cook Chinese food can make better wings than this place. Never try those rice dishes as well. Go only for the desserts."}
