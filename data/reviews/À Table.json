This restaurant has reopened under the name Madre on Fleury.
I'm looking forward to visit.

OMG!!! What a discovery this place is.  Thank you S. L.  !

The food is original and prepared with mastery.  The decor is simple yet refined and the service was friendly, knowledgeable, efficient, effaced...well just perfect.

This is a small restaurant that is a bit off the beaten track on Fleury.  It is so worth the detour.

They have a surprisingly large wine list and offer many of them by the glass.

We sampled  all of the 4 entrees on the menu as my dinner partner made his meal out of them.   They were all spectacular aside from the duck carpaccio that was very good but didn't have the intricacy of the other 3 entrées.  The tuna ceviche, that was brilliantly accompanied by a sweet potato puree, which neutralized the acidity from the lime marinade, was a masterpiece.

I had the beef cheeks braised in wine.  The meat had a rich, deep flavor and just melted in your mouth.  The mashed potatoes and assorted vegetables that accompanied it were perfect in every conceivable way.

A Table opened in July 2010 and is part of the Mario Navarrete Jr. group of restaurants (http://www.groupemnjr.com). He previously worked in such fine establishments as Bolude in NY and the defunct Les Caprices de Nicholas in Montreal.  

I am so going to visit his other restaurants soon.

I would say the food is just a notch down from Toqué but the prices are significantly lower.

If you're looking for a gem, that offers refined dishes, A Table is definitely the place"}

 A Table is the front runner for fine dining in Ahunstic. Unpretentious presentation with the freshest of ingredients, prepared perfectly and a warming atmosphere that would invite you to stay and finish the bottle.

  C'est tout.

{"text":"An adorable little gem hidden on Fleury! I went there for a brunch. The place is small and I suggest to reserve as places are limited.  It is awesome how they serve cornbread straight out of the oven! The brunch menu is original and offers some interesting twists on classic! And for those carnivores loving to eat steak at breakfast, you will be oh so happy! I had a spiced bavette with a sunny side up, roasted potatoes and aioli! Oh my was that awesome! However, the service was flawed.  The waiter did not served us all at the same time and it took everything to have a cup of coffee or water!  Still, the food is definitely worth it!"}
