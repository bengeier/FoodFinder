{"text":"1. Pad thai - Not ketchup-based or too sweet. Mine was salty but it would've been good if it was less salty. Not spicy. Comes with shrimp and chicken.   2. Vermicelli with spring roll, shrimp on sugar cane - Spring rolls were small and over-fried. Shrimp on sugar cane was bigger than other places."}
{"text":"This place is almost always packed during the regular lunch/dinner hours and have been operating at this location for years which just proves their consistent quality of food at a great price.   I had a large seafood Laska and a small house special beef pho, both were good but I'd have to say that the Laska looks better than it tastes (a little under flavoured in my pov and it came with the thick egg noodles and thin vermicelli which I don't really like) overall though you can't really go wrong with the selection and quality of this place"}
{"text":"Love this place it has become our favourite noodle place and we eat there at least once a week. The servers are friendly and attentive, the food always arrives quickly and tasting amazing and they always try to accommodate the kids food requests. I love the raw beef pho and my fiance loved to order the bbq beef ribs."}
{"text":"Food is honestly mediocre, it's like alot of other places. The place in the other plaza Pho vietnam is alot better, the dining experience there is so nice. This place is full of rude old women who seem like they hate life. They always roll their eyes or sigh or glare, honestly the service at vietnam noodle star sold me to never come back again. The back is really dirty too and I can smell old gym socks sometimes when I sit near the counter. Overall just unpleasant. The other branch near silverstar closed down too and the service was honestly just as bad. 0/10 would reccomend."}
{"text":"What really blew me away about this restaurant was their FRESH noodles - it was very soft and easy to chew. Very different from the typical Vietnamese restaurants. The broth was pretty tasty as well as it came out hot and had a good beefy flavour to it. They also have a very unique ordering system when eating Pho. You get to choose your own toppings and can put up to 3 choices such as the regular beef ball, rare beef or fish balls? It's a Chinese run restaurant BTW so you'll see some Chinese-Viet fusion dishes. Regardless, it's not a bad place to stop by for some Pho with fast service and a friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times as its a convenient location if you're in the midland and finch area. Service is always fast and the prices are very reasonable, if you don't care for the 5 star feel. I always get the beef pho with the option of having a variety of meat toppings - personal favorite of mine is the beef tendon and rare beef! The 3 meat with rice dish was really hearty and filling since you're getting a pork chop, slices of grilled beef and chicken. It included white rice with a side of pickled veggies. Green tea is always complimentary as you will definitely need it after the tasty broth!   I will continue to come back here for that pho fix and try different items on the menu."}
{"text":"Place is quite busy especially on weekends. Does not have the best pho in town. Best items to try are various stir fired rice noodles, the Singapore fried rice vermicelli being the best anywhere, although the chef could sometimes accidentally put in too much curry which ruins the supposedly mixed southeastern Asian flavour."}
{"text":"I eat my pho here so I'm a constant customer. My favourite pho is beef ketchup noodle here when I wear black shirt or if white shirt, raw beef noodle. Service is great, staff are helpful. I have seen they put order receipt on top the noodles when bringing it out. That thermal laser printing chemical can get people sick, they need to stop putting that slip on the soup, just bad practise. Other than this, food is great :)"}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant before, their service was not that good before. But today they were simply horrible. The servers were unpleasant, and they messed up the orders, they also insisted on we have to pay more tip when we are about to leave. It's funny I read other reviewers had the exact same bad experience. Business must be tough when they have to force people to pay more tip unwillingly. We are not going back again."}
{"text":"Love this place, great variety, everything is fairly priced and this place opens a little later than most other restaurants. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"So after finishing up at Man Ramen & Izakaya, I was not full, so I came here to eat AGAIN! I have been here a few times, and this place is fairly newly opened for maybe 2 yrs now. I've tried some of their stuff, and all seems to be fine.  On this particular day, we shared their appetizer platter: 2 spring roll, 1 sugar cane shrimp, 6 skewers of beef/chicken for a whopping $16!!! Expensive I'd say for a platter. We also got the Thai Shrimp Paste Rice which tasted alright. Just those two dishes came to $11 pp. for 3 ppl. Yes, I would come back here to eat if I'm around the area. The service is fine, the food is fine, and the price is a lil on the high side, but its fine.  Next time I may try their curry!!!"}
{"text":"We discovered this little gem when we were living in Scarborough. It was and still is our go to if we want pho noodles. I always order the house special pho and my husband always order raw beef and beef balls. They serve fresh noodles in their flavourful broth. We always order veggies to accompany our meal. We live in Aurora now and would drive 30 min to come here for the Pho."}
{"text":"Vietnam Noodle Star, WTF?  Why do you have to be so good and make all the other pho joints in Toronto seem like donkey dick*?  As if you need to have your massive ego inflated even more, lemme tell you why your pho is getting five stars: - Your broth is pungent with star anise and Uncle Ho's special spices.  - You let your customers pick and choose which meats to add to the pho so I don't end up with undesirable beef balls in a sliced beef and tendon combo like other places serve it. - Your raw beef slices steep gently in the heady broth and remain juicy and evermore tender. - Your tendon melts in the mouth, not in the hand. - Your fresh noodles are insanely smooth and have a high slurpability factor. - Your bean sprouts and basil look like you just picked them from your imaginary backyard garden. - A small bowl set me back $7 INCLUDING tax and tip and kept me full for 4-and-a-half hours.  BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO FAR AWAY and be virtually inaccessible by public transportation when I have no car? And why don't you open up a shop downtown?**   Because you're cruel, that's why.  I simultaneously love you and despise you. If you were a real person, we'd have to have  hot hate-sex now. _________________ * Thanks to Yelper Neil T. for the \"donkey dick\" coinage and the ride up to Scarborough ** Or at least near a subway line, AARRGGHH!"}
{"text":"While I do like their food and have been coming here every so often for the last 10 years or so, I found a nasty looking little hair (looked like it fell from someone's mustache) in my soup as I'm just about finished my bowl of noodles.. I didn't mention anything because I wasn't expecting them to do anything about it, I know these things happen.. but now every time I think of this place, I think of that piece of hair.."}
{"text":"This is my regular place to get pho. The portions are huge, the ketchup beef brisket is so flavourful, and the prices are cheap. I highly recommend getting pho with ketchup beef brisket in it. Also, the large size pho is enough for two people and it's less than $10. The sevice is very quick as well. When you first get in, you write your own order. It takes around 5 mins for food to come out (for pho). Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. I've been to this place a couple times now and the service was just horrible. We had to wait at least 40 minutes for our food to come but the portions were okay. The food tasted okay too. Nothing out of the ordinary. Oh and also, you HAVE tip them even if you didn't like their service. If you don't, they'll chase you down and create a scene in front of all the other customers. If you'd like a better pho place, I'd recommend the one in the plaza beside it and the place is called \"pho vietnam\"."}
{"text":"Quick service. Good prices. Beef noodles are always fresh.  Can be quite noisy though."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place recently.. the Pho and Laksa were horrible.  Couldn't even eat through a quarter of the bowls.  The food was that bad. We've been coming for a long time, 10 years+..  but I think its sad to say this was our last time."}
{"text":"Cheap, good vietnamese food.  This place holds a special place in my heart because I've been going there with my parents since I was a little kid. Much older now, I'd commute 40 mins to go here if I had to. Love the broth compared to other places, the noodles are not too soft or hard, and overall a big location (never any trouble getting seats).   Service is average, but on par with any other vietnamese place."}
{"text":"food was decent but service was non~existent, waitress asked us for a larger tip and would not allow us to leave until paid, would not come here again"}
{"text":"Fast, Cheap, and tasty. Definitely like coming here when I'm looking for a quick meal like Pho. The only downside is that the service can get a bit slow, and waiters demand tip from you which is probably because their owner pays them pennies so you can't blame them."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. The waitress and cashier were rude to me and my friend. Will never recommend anyone to go there."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, service was non existent, and they demanded tip. Will not return."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of pho, so I almost always get the curry here; I always get Malaysian style, beef brisket with rice. It's good stuff! A bit spicy but not so much that it's overpowering. The spring rolls (both fried and fresh varieties) are pretty good too, though I prefer the spring rolls from Pho 88 over on Warden/Bamburgh.  The restaurant is now bigger than it used to be, they expanded it to take over part of the neighboring place last year. Even so, at busy times you may have to wait, but usually not more than a few minutes. There is now a large bar-type area with single seats so if you're a lone diner you can sit there without taking up a whole table. The service is the usual bare-bones service you get any any place like this.  Overall, recommended."}
{"text":"Another Chinese run Vietnamese joint.  Pho tastes ok but not authentic.  They also use fresh noodle and not the thin type used in traditional Vietnamese restaurant.  I don't know why they only serve 2 size, small is really too small for me and large seems a bit expensive compare to other Vietnamese restaurants.  However, this seems like the best option available for Vietnamese in Scarborough area.  Maybe next time if I pass by the area I will try their rice options.  The service is like typical Chinese restaurants, efficient but not friendly nor rude."}
{"text":"I can appreciate that many Yelpers love this place, but I am not one of them.  I completely agree with Sarah's one-star review on 1/23/2010.  Here's why:  1. The food is mediocre at best.  It is NOT authentic Vietnamese food.  For the Bun dishes, the vermicelli noodles are thick and served warm.  The spring rolls are not Vietnamese-style at all, but small with a Chinese-style meat filling.  The food is so greasy (and Vietnamese food should not be greasy) that it makes me queasy after.  The fish sauce is just salty, without the sweet tang that good fish sauce should have.  And the pot of tea we were given must have been watered down several times, because it was just brown warm water.  Very nasty.  2. The service is horrible.  Prepare to get shouted at and/or ignored.    3. The restaurant is old and dirty.  I love Asian fast food diners (being Asian myself), but this place takes the cake.  I don't want to be rude but I've seen things that are definitely not hygienic.    Two thumbs down from this Viet food connoisseur."}
{"text":"Long time didnt come to this place. new renovation. kind of busy.  6 waitresses worked at that time. Not very friendly."}
{"text":"Love the pho here! Not the best service but very fast and efficient. I usually order the house special."}
{"text":"What a dump-shithole.  Very unclean, sticky floors, tables were barely wiped down and best of all I got violently sick from the pho I ordered.  DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"It's a good go to place.. For their dish '3 kinds of meat'. Pork, chicken, beef with rice that tastes good for a decent price. They got a pretty good tasting mango sticky rice I'm coconut milk dessert.  I wouldn't normally go for their pho but they do have a ketchup pho which is pretty good. The beef and noodles in the pho are less than desirable.   Service is good, but they don't accept credit but they do accept debit."}
{"text":"This is now on my favourite pho list. Would certainly come back. The pho was fantastic with big portions which is awesome. I love how each table has a service call thing."}
{"text":"This Vietnamese restaurant is the place to be. I've been to many Pho places (Pho 88, Peach, Pho train, etc.) but Vietnam Noodle Star is where quality meets price. I usually order the Rare beef or house special and it's terrific. If you order the rare beef, remember to cook the beef under the noodles! They accept debit (not credit) too.  Overall, this place hasn't disappointed me and I've been coming to this place for years. Why not 5 stars? Here's why. I come here because I know what I'm going to get and I know that it's not going to be bad. I know that service will be the same (nice and fast), but won't exceed my expectations. I know that they are consistent with their food, but it won't get any better. To get 5 stars, they would need to exceed my expectations, and my expectations of this place is 4 stars only."}
{"text":"Honestly, the pho is not good, just edible and the service isn't great either. I try to avoid coming here unless friends want to go here. Even then, I still try to avoid this place."}
{"text":"I love curry soup and this place nailed it. The Vietnamese spring rolls are delish too. I love that it's open late & has friendly staff. 5 stars easy."}
{"text":"My favourite Vietnamese noodle place uptown! They always have really quick service. This place has a lot of seating so although it's often busy, there is never a line.  I usually order the pho \"one-style\" meaning you get to pick one type of meat with your pho. They have one-style, two-style, and three-style options and they also have other preset dishes on their menu. Usually I also get the mango sticky rice dessert which is so good. Not all Vietnamese pho places have it and this is one that does. This time I tried the fried spring rolls which was good but I've had better at other places.   Super fast service, delicious pho and having that mango dessert is why this place gets my 5 stars."}
{"text":"My bf found a hair in his soup.  Then weeks later, I found a hair in my meal.  Dirty.  DIRTY!  I loved this place but I can't handle unhygienic restaurants"}
{"text":"I've been eating here regularly for the last 6 years.  The service is always friendly, food tasty and portions are large.   Great for quick eats on a tight budget.   Only down side is that at times the pho broth is to salty for my taste but other than that it's a+."}
{"text":"It's hard to beat Vietnamese food for bang-for-the-buck in quantity and taste of food (quality may be another issue).  Vietnam Noodle Star (or Noodlle as the sign reads lol) is on par with the better Viet Thai joints.  The broth had the right amount of oil floating on top, the vermicelli comes with TWO spring rolls and they weren't stingy on the sprouts.  Moreover, the servers say 'please' and 'thank you'. :) I would def come back if I had to run errands in Scarberia."}
{"text":"We always order the same things every time we come here... House special pho, pho with raw beef and beef balls and fresh veggies stirred fried with garlic. We like the fresh noodles and the broth. The service is friendly and the food comes fast."}
{"text":"Came here a little while with a bunch of friends and had the pleasure of ordering their bun with a choice of 3 ingredients. The price is very cheap for the portions you get and it's honestly pretty delicious too. There were mounds of grilled beef with hints of sweet honey flavour, chunks of aromatic lemongrass chicken and crispy spring rolls with lots of ingredients. My friends who had pho also seemed to really enjoy their meals.  The portions seem so massive!   For a full review with all the pictures, feel free to check out my website, conveniently located in my profile. Cheers :)"}
{"text":"My go-to place for pho! This place is one of the only ones I know of that still serve the thicker noodles; it seems that all other pho locations only have the thin noodles. Broth tastes good and service is quick. I also like the spring rolls and meat skewers."}
{"text":"Im a regular here. It's a great place with lots of variety on the menu but i usually get the pho! Its very familiar and tasty."}
{"text":"My wife and I were up for a bowl of Pho and this place is close to us, been living in the area for almost 20 years and this is first time to visit.  I'm not gonna comment on the authenticity of the Pho, I'm not qualified enough to do that.  However, for us and our experience with Pho it was still good.  We ordered the chicken slices Pho, with Pineapple & Sausage fried rice along with shrimp curry malaysian style.  It was too much food for us, we ended up taking the left over curry shrimp and the fried rice home.  For curries, I'm not so much into the heat/spice so I always ask for mild, I'm after the flavor without so much the kick to the tongue in spice.  Service was relatively quick.  The servers/wait staff attitude and behaviour leave a lot to be desired.  Place is quite spacious and the parking can fill up quite fast depending on the time of day you happen to visit.  This place was more wallet friendly than Pho Vietnam.  I'd say if you're on a smaller budget for dining out this is a good place to go with family or small group.  Enjoy your meal, just don't pay attention or be to critical on the wait staff..since language is apparently an obstacle if you're an English speaking foodie dining here.  We plan on going back, there are quite a few dishes that caught our interest.  Oh just so you won't be caught off guard when you settle your bill, they do charge $0.25 convenience fee if settle with Debit or Credit card.  No need to make a huge fuss over it since lot of Asian restos split or charge the whole merchant fee towards the consumer.  Some Caucasian foodie aren't used to this practice."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pho restaurants.  I really like the noodles here. I like my noodles a little chewy so this has the best.  I don't expect much but they are generous with their portions.  Most importantly I find that they are very consistent with their taste.  If I have a pho craving, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"The FHubs and his friends usually come here to eat after their volleyball league. I felt adventurous and tried out the seafood laksa egg noodles . FHubs had it last time and he said it was really really good....and he was right!! I rarely eat laksa so I don't know how authentic it's suppose to taste, but the curry soup was absolutely delicious. The seafood was cooked perfectly, and the egg noodles was a bit soft which I LOVED. Overall I enjoyed this dish. I usually order their pho, but it's really meh. I think I'll be ordering this the next couple of times we go. This restaurant opens till 12 am, so it's perfect for a late night meal ~"}
{"text":"Man, this place is AMAZING!!  I've been coming to this place for 7 years now and it has never disappointed me once, their broth and noodles are fairly different from your typical pho place (the noodles are a bit thicker), and it's delicious!   This place just puts so much ingredients into your Pho, if you get a raw beef Pho be prepared to have a handful of beef in your noodles when it's served to you.   My personal favourites are the house special (which comes with a bit of everything), and the raw beef Phos, if you are in the area definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. I asked for an extra cup (mine was dirty) and the lady heard but ignored me. I asked two more times because initially I thought she couldn't hear me properly..."}
{"text":"I come here often since I live near by the area. I'm never really disappointed coming here, as my food always turns out the same. I typically get their house special pho bowl or their seafood laksa. Both tasted good to me! Their menu is quite big and offers various choices, which I like, as it offers something different to try. Their drinks and snacks are not bad either, A-okay! The pricing of the menu is notably the same as most pho places, though I'm sure one can find cheaper places out there. Service is (usually) responsive when you call for them. Atmosphere is typical Asian restaurant, but I like that it's a pretty big restaurant so I never have trouble getting a table. So far, I haven't been unhappy with this place which is why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"A good place for a quick pho fix. Their most basic pho noodles with one topping are $6-7 for a small size and $9ish for a large. The place can get quite crowded around dinner time but they have quite a lot of seats so the wait time is never too long. They also have a menu with a wide variety of asian foods like thai, chinese, & vietnamese. They have fruit slushies and milkshake drinks and also a small menu for asian desserts!"}
{"text":"Been going there for 20 years.It was very good,probably the best in T/O at that time.I stopped going there too frequently when they switched to melamine cups  which soaked up the bleach used in the cleaning process smell making u drink bleached smell tea. then they changed to ceramic cups.But the last straw was the decrease in meat portions.Meat balls became bits in the mixed beef pho. Sorry sayonara forever."}
{"text":"This is the only pho place I like! I just get the regular pho with only raw beef, it's delicious every time :)   It's more of a family restaurant. Service is not bad for an Asian place."}
{"text":"By far, probably one of the best pho places that I've been to in the GTA. I typically don't order the specials at pho places for their pho because their raw beef isn't that amazing and it's all cooked by the time it comes out and it's thin and low quality.   We ordered (2) of the small House Special Noodle Soup (#1109 - $7.99). The small order came with quite a bit of noodles, tripe, tendon, beef ball, cooked beef and raw beef. I have to say their beef broth was great and their raw beef was the highlight for me -- it actually tasted like good quality raw beef, there's was quite a bit of beef - raw and cooked as well.   Altogether, a great place for pho - can't speak to the rest of their items on the menu, but i would definitely come back for the noodles and beef!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite spot for pho but their service has just deteriorated each time I've come. Management needs to be able to admit when they've make a mistake instead of essentially forcing the customer to accept what clearly isn't what they ordered. In the interest of saving $5, you've lost a customer for life.   The pho itself is still alright but there's honestly better places like Little Saigon or even 88. FYI In terms of vermicelli bowls, it's always been kind of shit here though."}
{"text":"For a pho place, it's pretty good. The soup is the right balance of salty goodness and soft, fresh noodles. The portions for other non-pho dishes like the bian hoi is a decent size. I love that unlike other pho places, you can mix and match and choose the exact combination of beef parts and other additions like chicken to go towards making your own personal perfect bowl of pho. Hubby had the XL pho and he was very pleased with the quality of his meat. Maybe they were just really busy when we came because they didn't bother to separate the slices of raw beef. He was pretty annoyed at having to work at separating them so it would cook properly.   It has the same printed menu as Golden Elephant up the street on Steeles, so I wonder if they are owned by the same people? It is so much bigger and brighter now that they have expanded to double their original restaurant size."}
{"text":"My go to for pho.   They do raw beef pho amazingly and there aren't too many places that can replicate its taste or quality.   My husband always requests to order a dish of chicken wings.   Everytime the waitresses ask, unmmm  you want the snack size or large?   If they knew that my husband has a black hole for a stomach, they'd stop asking.   Their wings are amazing.   No batter just deep fried.   It comes out crunchy without the oiliness.    The restaurant can fill up quickly during peak hours.   But service is quick and food tastes great.   There's a reason why this restaurant has been here for over 10 + years."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Pho Noodle soup with rare beef. I have been coming here for years and their soup is done very well with flavorful broth.   We always order the pho rare beef and shrimp rolls. The shrimp rolls are beautiful to the eyes and not sloppy looking like most places!    They give a lot of fresh Basil leaves! And have super friendly/ kind service. They really are good servers and personal with you like a best friend.   The portions I will say are the BIGGEST in all of Canada probably. Lol from my experience anyways. I find there are so many noodles I have to pick it out and pack home.   I would say they do make this a more Cantonese style restaurant with many dishes aimed towards Chinese/Vietnamese people. I reccomend this for soup over the other cooked dishes because after all it's for soup !!!  Best cheap eats in Scarborough and always satisfying with a cup of Milk Tea."}
{"text":"Alright alright alright. Vietnam Noodle Star is my favourite Vietnamese restaurant uptown. First off, their service is great; the staff are attentive and the kitchen prepares your food at light speed.  Many of their items are under $10 (woot!!!), Which is awesome. Their pho is amazing, and I always opt for their large size (they offer small and large, both under $10). I can be quite sensitive to MSG (I get the tingles  on my tongue), so it's nice to note that they use little to no MSG in their broth. Despite this, their broth is always on point and incredibly flavorful.  I also ordered a side of deep fried lemon grass chicken wings, which was also very tasty. It's impressive how they can make the outside so crispy (but not oily) while leaving the inside really hot and tender.  I usually order a Vietnamese style coffee (they add condensed milk--yummy!) to go with my meal, but today I ordered a \"3 colour shake\", which was a cold drink made with red bean, yellow bean and green jelly with coconut milk. It was delicious and I will be ordering it again.   A favorite of mine and it's always a big hit with me and my family."}
{"text":"It's a pretty big restaurant, but it's also pretty busy. We came in around 8 PM and it was still packed. Washrooms smell a bit weird.  Their menu features various rice and noodle dishes, as well as curry. They also sell bread and roti on the side.  I picked this restaurant through recommendation because apparently the pho bowls are huge. And, yes, they are pretty big compared to some other pho places (see pictures). it's probably good enough for two people, as several tables were also sharing large bowls of pho. Our table actually had two large bowls of pho but they only offered one small plate of bean sprouts and garnishes. There isn't much flavour to the broth or the noodles, but the meat was alright. For $10, you're getting a massive bowl of pho, so it's not a bad deal if taste is not that important.    Also tried the curry with chicken and roti, but it was no good. Curry was very watery and the chicken didn't have much flavour. You're paying $2.50 for a piece of roti, but it's thin and flaky."}
{"text":"I love pho and tried the raw beef noodle soup here. The beef cooked slow, the service was decent, and the onions in the soup were the best part. Very average pho spot. Also, do not get their spring rolls; waste of a dish for us as they were small and bland."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Their beef pho soup is forever my favorite since I was very very very young!!! I USUALLY order the raw beef pho but because of personal reason for the next 6 months or so I can't eat anything raw.... So I order the cooked beef pho although I liked it, I still found the beef too fatty for my liking. I don't usually eat that much fat. We had the spring rolls and u can't go wrong with that!!! I also got the durian milkshake yum!!! Acquired tasted , I absolutely loved it!! I envied my hubby's bowl of raw beef pho and he enjoyed that! He also had the ice Vietnamese coffee that he said he let it cool off for too long and was water down due to the ice melted but he usually likes it!! I also order the satay soup noodle, garlic bread, veggies with garlic, skewers, vermicelli with fish sauce, garlic bread, fried rice at one point in time and I enjoyed it all and all turned out really good! :) this place is a go if you want hot steamy soup noodle :)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pho in the area.   Good price and great portions of noodles and beef! They don't skimp out. Broth is absolutely delicious. I've tried many pho restaurants and this is my go to place, I never try any other place now because they can't compare. I eat here every 2 weeks or less. Love it!"}
{"text":"My Vietnamese friend recommended this place so I knew I had to go. The restaurant had ample seating and a counter for people eating solo (which is where I ended up).  I ordered the \"house special\" large pho. The broth was very different from all other pho places I've been to in scarborough. It was super rich, hearty, and almost cream-like. The noodles were also thicker and heavier than other places I had been. The beef portions were also very generous. I did not finish it.  I got a Hong Kong style iced milk tea to drink with my meal. It was a bit pricey, but it was quite large and very tasty so I was ok with it.  I will definitely return to try some other dishes before I give it 5 stars. But I highly recommend coming here if you want a rich pho experience."}
{"text":"Vietnam Noodle Star is in my neighbourhood, so I grew up frequenting this quite a bit.  A funny fact is that I was vegetarian for most of my teenage and university years, so I cannot say much about the pho here!  I hear it's decent.  I mainly ate the Malaysian noodle dishes (asam laksa) and the curries here.  I will say I was not a devout vegetarian because I did not question the type of protein that was used for the broth and curry, though the staff members did tell me twice that they were made with a seafood broth (I was pescatarian at one point).  The laksa was a great experience; it was not overbearingly spicy and it had a nice zing to it! It also had two types of noodles (one thin type and one thicker and rounded type) in the soup.   The curries were more on the thinner side, which I did not mind, and they weren't watery by any means when I say they were thinner.  The curries were served with either rice, roti, or bread.  I would recommend getting the roti or rice, but the bread was not bad.  All their curries and laksa broths were very flavourful and hits you well, though they were a bit on the oilier side mind you.  This is a pretty good place for group outings, as they have enough seating ranging from a date to a birthday party.  They also take credit and their servers can speak English, so those are definite pluses in the Midland/Finch plaza."}
{"text":"My search for pho nirvana in the GTA has found a new winner in Vietnam Noodle Star. THIS IS IT! Thanks to Neil and Katrina for introducing this place to me, they really know their stuff. Mind you it's far in the burbs' where all the good ethnic food haunts typically are but it's worth it if you can find transportation. So I was lucky enough to be brought here this past weekend with fellow yelpers Neil and Susan. Our trip was a rewarding experience 'cuz the pho here is sublime! In other words, I could stick my head in a vat of it and inhale happily.   To start with, the broth is gorgeous, enticing and complex. It's so good and it's a main reason why the pho here is outstanding. Slightly salty too but the strong tones of star anise balance it out. The noodles are fresh and they give you a healthy portion in every serving for your slurping pleasure. There is also a lot of meat in each bowl as well and it's thinly sliced and does not shrivel up into curly bits unlike other pho joints. It was the also the first time I tried tendon in pho, a tasty addition with it's gooey, jello like texture! The herb plate had the standard bean sprouts, basil and lime, no saw but when you have a pho this good, I can do without.   This place meets the holy trinity of requirements on my list for a phenomenal bowl of pho: fresh noodles, thinly sliced beef and richly flavoured stock. If only they could expand downtown damnit! Until then, I'm left pestering friends with cars for trips out here."}
{"text":"Vietnam Noodle Star will and probably always be my go-to Pho place. However, my trip this time, their pho soup was really watered down and I could barely taste any flavour which sucked :( !! But it still filled me up every time I come here. Sometimes even a small size would suffice. My friend thinks the \"large\" portion of the Pho is just simply more soup and noodle instead of more meat - which could be possible but who knows???  Service here was pretty quick this time. The lady came up to us without even asking and we ordered our meals - though I'm not sure why we don't order the moment we enter since we almost always order the same thing every time, hahaha.  It was uncomfortable paying the bill this time as the lady just STOOD THERE, watching me as I paid for the bill. Which resulted me in tipping more.... argh. Pressure much?"}
{"text":"Pho is way too salty and way too much Msg. It used to be good but feel like it went downhill since their renovation. They do give you a lot but the quality isn't there in my opinion."}
{"text":"It's really baffling how many posters have indicated that this is the best bowl of pho in Toronto. It's only mediocre at best if that, like another poster has indicated regardless of how busy it is. It's not authentic, it's really a chinese version of Vietnamese food. For i.e. the Pho broth has no real flavour and that's the biggest mistake a lot of chinese owned Vietnamese restaurant owners make.  You will also notice that even though it's busy, very few ppl in the Vietnamese community frequent this place because it's not authentic.  If you want to do a comparsion of what a real good bowl of pho should taste like, try Pho Tien Thanh and Pho Dau Bo on Finch Ave West which are the the standard for Pho in Toronto."}
{"text":"Placed at a nice location but the workers so too loud. They sound like a bunch of teenagers that are gossiping about school beef...or tip in this case. The noodles of the pho itself are kind of slimy and not as traditional. I asked for napkins and it took them about a year to give them which is pretty weird considering the fact that they were LITERALLY in her apron. The price is nice for students who are broke. Lesson: less talking more napkin giving. *dabs*"}
{"text":"I grew up eating this place and good to see that this place still is alive and well and expanding while the other places around it have come and gone. There's something about Pho places that stay alive because of the simplicity of the meals yet difficult enough that it's too hard to make it at home. Though I will have to admit that the quality has gone downhill, as their Pho broths these days are pretty watered down but at least the wide noodles are here to stay along with freshly sliced beef. The beef slices they serve here feel more fresh and better tasting than the ones in California in my opinion and also the fact that they serve wide rice noodles. I had Pho in Vietnam and I'm accustomed to wide rice noodles, Pho places in Cali seem to serve only thin rice noodles which I still to this day don't enjoy and have a much higher preference for wide noodles in my Pho. Beef slices served in Cali are super thin and were cut from frozen it seems versus what they do here. They are a little thicker here so you get more texture than just a thin sheet of meat which I personally prefer. I have seen this place go from charging $5 bucks a bowl to over $9. Oh how time and inflation works."}
{"text":"Got the pho noodle special and had no complaints. Large for 10.99 was very filling. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"When I had night class during the summer, I would go back to Scarborough feeling a bit hungry.  What's there to eat at 11:00 pm for an individual that didn't want to cook at home after a long day?  Vietnamese Pho of course because this place closes late and they always welcome single diners plus there was a LCD on FairchildTV.  Even during late-night period at least half the tables are still full, and I'm NOT the last one to go in and I see more and more people coming through the door be it individuals, couples, families, co-workers.  Compared to my usual spot in Vaughan, this place doesn't have as much value or selection but at 11:00 pm all you really want is a filling healthy bowl of Pho and QUICK.  I say healthy because my other option I take sometimes is POPEYES, as it was a Tuesday night class."}
{"text":"It's worth the drive to the 'Bro. Simply put, this is the best place in the GTA for pho. They use fresh noodles (not dry) and their broth is more flavorful and fresh compared with many others -- it has that certain touch of sweetness to it (maybe it's the extra star anise, I dunno).   The pho is custom ordered -- you pic the size, the number and types of meat, and away you go. I like the raw beef, brisket, and tendon combo. When tendon is cooked properly, it literally melts in your mouth, which this does. Oh so good.   Yes, this place is run by Chinese BUT they serve their food more authentic than other Chinese run Viet joints (see my review on Vic Hong). Whether it's the noodles, rice dishes, or various apps, you can't go wrong with this place. And yes, it is worth the drive to the 'Bro. All this place needs is a downtown location and we're good to go."}
{"text":"Came here with one of my girls on a whim because it was cold and we were looking for some soup. It's a nice Vietnamese restaurant in an Asian area with lots of seating to choose from and minimal decor.   Anyways, we were seated right away and although it looked quite busy, after deciding on our food, we were served within 5 minutes!   You get started off with green tea which is always nice, especially on a cold winter day. We both got the Tom Yum soup which was amazing! I just didn't like that my shrimp still had their eyeballs on as I don't like my food staring at me (personal preference), but other than that everything tastes great. Just the right amount of spice and flavour. We ordered a small and it was quite large and filling for $7.99 I believe.   As for service, not to generalize but typically you know what kind of service to expect when you come to Asian type restaurants that are not mainstream so there was no surprise there.   But overall, if I was in the area (as it is a bit of a distance from where I live), I'd come back."}
{"text":"The workers seem to be a bit dazed, had to work a bit to get their attention...and we were sitting in front of the counter too xD. Can't say the food was anything to rave about. Tasted pretty standard compared to other Pho restaurants."}
{"text":"Oh. I have yet to write a review about Vietnam Noodle Star. How did I miss this? This is my go-to pho place, although honestly (and don't hate me), pho isn't something I crave on a regular basis. It's also a childhood haunt for me. I am also someone who doesn't usually order rare beef. I do cooked beef here because they use brisket to make their cooked beef, and it's delicious. They also do a fantastic meat to noodle ratio.   Prices are on the cheap end of things, for the most part. Pineapple and sausage fried rice comes in a hollowed out pineapple half and costs $9.99. Ratio of rice to other stuff was rather good, and pineapple was fresh. I think green curry chicken (bone-in chicken, not chicken chunks) with roti was $8.99. The roti was a tad dry but there are other options like small French baguettes and rice. We got a lovely plate of bun hoi for less than $10 as well. Think thin vermicelli with veggies and your pick of meats/grilled items/spring roll with a side of fish sauce. Very tasty.   My favorite dish of the night was the boneless chicken feet with spicy and sweet chili sauce ($5.99). Portion was good for price. Not completely boneless, but the big bones are taken out. It's not rubbery or goopy. It's sort of crisp. I can't really describe it in English. It tastes almost like pickled radish/carrots, and it's served with sweet chili sauce. Grandpa said he didn't want any, then ate three or four.  Glad this restaurant is still alive and kicking after so many years."}
{"text":"I've frequented Vietnam Noodle Star many times in the last few weeks. It's actually quite large inside and around lunch time this place really fills up. The wait staff are nice and always give me a fork for my spoon (the noodles are hard to grab!) Their condiment selection is on par and so are their prices.  I've gotten traditional pho and another soup dish which was just as good. The \"small\" portion size is actually pretty big in my opinion so I always have soup to take away. A friend of mine for a rice dish with a selection of meats and he loved it.   Overall I would say the food is flavourful, affordable and the service is fast. Give them a try - they have great pho broth."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute go-to for pho! I've been to many other pho places but none compare to Vietnam Noodle Star. My family and I have been going here for over 10 years and the quality of food has never changed - always fresh, always delicious, and of course, always well priced."}
{"text":"This is one of the few pho restaurants that has fresh ho fun (rice noodle).  This is the default restaurant for pho in Scarborough.   The meat and portion size is bigger than other places.   It's always busy but turn around time is quick."}
{"text":"It's an above-average place for a quick Vietnamese meal. Fast service, relaxing atmosphere.   Pho, dry vermicelli, curry, chicken feet, satay, grilled pork tenderloin, chicken wings are our regulars. We usually come in small groups and always attempted to hot pho and appetizers and don't have extra room for other dishes. :D   Hum, don't order grilled squid, neither the taste nor the portion worth the money."}
{"text":"WOW!! This place is amazing!! I went here once back in februrary, and totally forgot the name of it. But ever since then, I've been craving to go back but the only thing I knew was that it was a pho place at the intersection of midland and finch. Let me tell you.. the parking is horrific! The people are driving and parking on the wrong side, putting on hazards lights to wait for people and they back out of spaces with no warning. It's an accident waiting to happen.  The restaurant is quite large and spacious, there's a lot of room but it can get busy on weekends and nights.  However, this pho place deserves 5 stars! The meat is the best quality meat I've ever had in a pho restaurant! The beef is legitimately RARE, and you can cook it in your hot soup to the point where you like it. I love rare meat, so when the beef is soft and tender, hnnnnng, it just makes me so happy. I have to admit, this is not the best pho I've ever had (the noodles). I like pho with a little bounce in it, but I guess this is just standard pho.  They have so much noodles in one bowl that a small can make you full.  Also, the food came so fast- it was here in less than 3 minutes after we handed in our menus.   Definitely will be returning even though the drivers in this lot makes me want to die. So deliciouso."}
{"text":"This place is run by Chinese people but honestly, their Vietnamese noodle is top notch. The soup base that they use has NO MSG but is so flavourful and just makes the noodles that much better.  I've tried many other places and I still find myself coming back here. The noodles are perfectly cooked and not gummy as I've found with other places. The price is ridiculously cheap and their snacks are decent. But if you come here, you better be ordering the noodles because there is no other reason to come here.  As is customary in Chinese/Asian restaurants, this place is cash only."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the past thirteen years, from when they were a tiny unit up until recently when they expanded into the two units next door.  Up until recently they would have rated 5 stars easily however, there seems to have been a change of sorts in this restaurant.  First off, the food is very tasty, I recommend the pho soup #1103 with cooked beef and beef brisket. The portions are quite good, and the brisket melts in your mouth.  I am also a big fan of their Malaysian curry, also beef brisket, served with rice.  The sauce is quite flavourful and has enough heat, without being too spicy.  I have tried several other items on the menu, all with good results.  Now, the changes.    First off, the prices have risen quite a bit, now they are still affordable, but some of their prices have doubled.    Secondly the staff have become quite demanding with regards to their tips.  When my wife and I first started to eat there, we were among the minority of customers who tipped the waitstaff.  Now however, they have become quite demanding with said tips.  Refusing to take payment unless there is a minimum of 15% (on average I tip 10% unless there is something spectacular with the service).  I recently placed a pickup order, and had the lady at the counter made some disparaging comments about me not tipping her, when I told her that almost no one tips for pickup, she muttered \"some people do\" under her breath.  What made that worse, was that they messed up my order and refused to change it when I called them on it.  Hopefully this is rectified soon enough as this place is one of my favourites, I would hate to have to look for a replacement."}
{"text":"A popular staple in Scarborough, this is one of my favorite go to places for Pho. Some of the dishes I would recommend here are the skewers, pho of course and definitely get the mango sticky rice for dessert. These are some my favorites to order and recommend to my friends. This I ordered the Pork Chop with Rice and also ordered a Mango Milkshake. You get fish sauce to drizzle over the meat and rice and it always tastes so good. They give you pretty good portions for a dish less than $10. They have quite the extensive food and drink menu and the price ranges from $3-$15 so a lot of choices for cheap eats. The staff and service here is pretty good. They are usually attentive and quickly to respond if you need anything. They only accept debit and cash as their method of payment here. Overall, a pretty decent place to get your pho fix and other Vietnamese foods!!"}
{"text":"I have always liked Vietnamese noodle soup, so I went with my family to try this place out.  We ordered a little of everything, I will start with the soap, it was good there were a lot of veggies in it just like I like soap, the beef on top was a little undercooked for my taste. The fried rice with chicken and the fried rice with ship were delicious. We also ordered fried chicken just to try it and it was really good.  The hot plates like steamed vegetables and beef hot plate were also good. There is a selection of fruit smithies kind of like bubble tea, I ordered the mango and liked it.   Over all the restaurant experience with good, our food was brought out in a timely manner, the service with good, and the food was well made and tasteful. I definitely will be going back.   #30daysofyelp"}
{"text":"This place is good for quick cheap eat. I usually come before peak dinner hours before 7:00 pm. It tends to be quite busy then but wait time is fast because food comes out fast. Their pho is pretty good. I usually either order the fried chicken steak pho (7.99) or the tomato beef brisket pho (6.99). Portions are quite big and is pretty tasty. Service is fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Didn't get the chance to try the pho here as I was ordering for takeout and didn't want to deal with the hassle. I opted to get the chicken curry with roti instead. The curry itself wasn't really anything to write home about, but the roti on the other hand definitely was. It was crispy and oily, fried to perfection. Unfortunately, it was the best part of the meal. Having bone-in chicken really slowed down the meal.   I'd probably go and check the place out again to give it a fair evaluation, but the roti was so good that I may just return for that alone! It's definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"I have been to this place for many years for their pho! It is pretty cheap for a large portion of pho! I love their pho and their Vietnamese spring rolls!   However, the only problem with this place is their customer service. It is always busy and the servers always seem very rude and seem to not come help you as they are rushing back and forth with orders!"}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this place a lot. We are of Vietnamese decent and we are picky about our pho. This place has the best pho we've tasted so far. We've been customers for over half a decade. The noodles are thick and the broth is tasty. The price is decent as well. I usually go for the Beef Pho with Satay soup. It is sooooo damn good! It's not spicy and it comes with a lot of beef. More than enough. They also have a house fried rice that is delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to all pho lovers!"}
{"text":"Ok - just so you know, I came here at 3PM on a Sunday afternoon and probably at the worst time when the kitchen staff were sitting down for their own lunch but nonetheless I was sorely disappointed.   Went with the pho because that's just a no-brainer. The noodles were fresh but the broth was lacking....perhaps they ran out of the good stuff?? The beef tendon was melty but the brisket was tough and the raw beef was flavorless. The tea was off somehow (maybe they accidentally dropped in some soap?)  Overall, I left very unimpressed. The crowds were there. Maybe the timing was bad. I'll give it one more chance but expectations certainly are lower."}
{"text":"I should've dedicated my first review to Vietnam noodle star. I started coming here almost 20 years ago and it is still my go-to pho place. Their pho is not authentic Vietnamese pho, but i love the flavorful broth, their hot sauce, their jellyfish chicken salad, grilled pork neck, and their lemongrass chicken.  My usual order is the house special pho (#1110) and their jellyfish chicken salad (#801). I also really like their lemongrass chicken and porkchop mung too. You can ask them to help precook the bean sprouts if you are worried about getting sick or if you are pregnant."}
{"text":"It's really good here I always order the house special. However I don't like their cold spring rolls as it's not authentic. They use vermicelli noodles instead of rice noodles which makes a difference in texture."}
{"text":"Great variety of Vietnamese dishes. Might not be the most authentic one, but it tastes good and price right. Portion is great enough, if you order a large pho, it is good enough to be shared by 2 people. It is always busy, even after 10pm. I would recommend anyone who wants Vietnamese food to go there. I don't think you will be disappointed, other than saying it's hard to find a parking spot at that plaza. Enjoy guys!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this place all the time with my family but haven't been here for a few years. When I ate here again the other day it was the same as I remembered. The quality seems to be consistent over the years and it is still as busy as it used to be during peak hours.   I always order the rare beef pho when I come here. I never had problems with slow service. The food always comes out fast.   Parking here is hard during peak hours."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????8??????????????????????????????????ok,??????????????????????????????????ok."}
{"text":"One word to describe this place - Pho-licious.  I've tried many, I mean, many Vietnamese noodle houses in Toronto. It's the same typical and tiring bowl of beef noodle soup everytime I want to satisfy my pho craving.   As you enter in, you notice that at almost every table, everyone has an order of at least 1 bowl of Vietnamese beef noodle bowl. You can hear slurping; you can see people busy fishing through their almost empty bowl for the last remnants of their meal; you know you came to the right place.  It was packed, even though it was 2:00 in the afternoon. I like how you can pick n' choose the different toppings in your bowl. Or you can opt for their house special, which includes a bit of everything. One of the biggest factors in a good noodle bowl is the broth and the freshness of noodles.   The broth was tasty and enticing, with a distinct anise flavour. The beef slices remain tender and juicy, after being cooked in the soup base. The noodles are fresh!  Note: I dislike the raw taste of the bean sprouts, but the servers are willing to take it back to the kitchen to broil it for you if you request it."}
{"text":"Added more pictures of good food! Had the vermicelli bowl with 4 springs rolls for only $8!! Not a bad deal! I saw another table that had a pineaple with rice in I so I wanted to try it out but it wasn't that great tasting compared to the presentation."}
{"text":"this is a more Hong Kong style pho restaurant - the owners are Chinese and not Vietnamese. i come here for their pho, it's definitely one of my favourite broths. their noodles are Chinese rice noodles not the traditional pho noodles so take that into consideration. a lot of people come and come it to the traditional Vietnamese style but it's different. they make their broth fresh everyday and their beef is usually the best quality. their rice dishes are also great - you can't go wrong with any grilled meat dishes. their vermicelli again, is a bit different so if you're expecting the traditional style, don't order it (you may be disappointed). again, their beef broth is by far what i come for!"}
{"text":"Vietnam Noodle Star won't get 5 stars from me.  I tried this place based on the yelp reviews expecting the pho to be amazing, but sadly the pho soup based failed to impress.  It lacked the full flavour spectrum that makes pho soup so delicious.  When you sip pho soup you expect your taste buds to go on overdrive and taste the many spices (anise, cloves, coriander, fennel, cardamom) that packs the full pho punch - but the soup base here is very mild and tame.  It taste more like Chinese beef bone soup, which is great in it's own right but can't pass for pho.    I also ordered their lemon grass chicken wings, and my advice is to steer clear of these.  This place obviously doesn't change their frying oil that frequently, for the chicken wings just tasted of stale oil. Also there was no lemon grass flavour to be had.    Overall, I am not impressed by this place, as it's definitely not authentic Vietnamese and you can get much better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Vietnam Noodle Star has ruined Pho for me forever.... but it's in a good way.  I never thought I would need to drive to Scarborough just for Pho. I was skeptic about how good this bowl would be as the drive out made it even more unattractive and I wasn't feelin' the good vibes.   I step inside to a odd looking color scheme. Green chairs, sticky wood tables, and Chinese television blaring. I wasn't expecting much but the atmosphere wasn't exactly leaning to great eats.   The servers weren't rude but they don't speak English so it's straight to business and order up.  I order my Pho and started to regret my decision for driving all the way out here for what seemed would be a typical bowl of Pho.  Pho-uck was I wrong. This Pho is the best bowl of Pho I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. Once I had my fist bit of noodle with flank steak and beef tendon my day brightened and I looked back at my unenthusiastic self from 5mins ago in pity. Sooo tasty. I ordered the extra large and it is pho-ucking huuuge. You can easily feed 3-4 people with this size bowl but it was just so good I finished the entire bowl and craved for more even though I was ridiculously full.  Overall, best bowl of Pho ever. Definitely worth the drive up if you like your Pho and definitely worth the price. The soup is fantastically seasoned without traces of MSG and not overly salty. Noodles are fresh and perfectly tender. The cuts of meat are of great quality and perfectly cooked (or perfectly raw if your ordered it). Make your way out to this joint. Do it!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Good for crowds, lots of tables, wait time is never too long. that said this place can get pretty packed.   Food:Tom Yum Goong Pho, something about their soup base always has me coming back, their raw beef is so perfectly sliced. super delicious.   Overall: i keep on coming back.  portion are super generous and pricing is cheap."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and the service is kind of up and down. We once had to ask for our bill 4 times in 20 minutes before they gave us our bill... Sometimes they're quick and other times they just forget you ever spoke to them. It's always busy here so thats a good sign, but I would review other yelper's recommendations as they have a fairly extensive menu and that means some dishes won't be so great.  My boyfriend had the chicken and rice which he enjoyed. I had vermicelli the last time and this time I wanted to try something a big warmer and soupy. I went for the house special. I can honestly say I wouldn't come here for pho ever again.. The noodles were so mushy and all the meat they used was mushy as well. I don't know if you've ever had beef slices that melted together like that before, but you can tell it's severely freezer burned. It was really not appetizing at all.   On the other hand, I would go just for an order of the thai boneless chicken feet. :) Picked perfectly, just a nice balance of sweet and sour. That was quite appetizing. (maybe just take it to go)  Places with large menus like this are a hit and miss. If they have a lot of offerings, it means they aren't likely paying close attention to each dish they create and probably just make it on the fly with not much care or respect for their ingredients. But cheap food for a quick meal.. can you really ask for more?"}
{"text":"Came here after work with a few friends. This place is quite busy.  My friends ordered the Pho special and I ordered the Thai style curry chicken with rice. I would say the sauce is quite good however the meal was underwhelming. It seems like the just poured the curry sauce over boiled chicken and potatoes. The chicken had huge bones in it. Not sure about the Pho, however my friends said they tasted kinda bland."}
{"text":"One of the best pho places that give huge portions. Their service is also good and fast! Quality of the food is always delicious (i love their soup for the pho) and theres a lot of seats but they are usually nearly full during dinner time.  There is also a lot of topping selections for your pho or vermicelli which you don't see often in other restaurants which is a huge plus for me!  This is one of my go-to spots for Vietnamese food :)  The only downfall to this restaurant is that their cups aren't always the cleanest - I found a piece of bean sprout in my water just today"}
{"text":"This place was gross. it was clearly Cantonese style Vietnamese food.  There was nothing authentic about it and I was so excited to try it out based on the good reviews.  For starters, the Pho broth was oily and unflavourful.  There was no semblance of lemongrass or any of the other flavour for the matter that one would expect in the soup.  The noodles were falling apart and the restaurant was skimpy on the lime wedges.    Sadly, it was not only the pho that was a dissapoinment.  The pad thai was Cantonese style fried noodles with tiny shrimp thrown into the mix (hardly even close to a pad thai) and the spicy chicken looked like it was from KFC.  The only redeeming item that we tried was the pickeled veggies, which I don't believe are vietnamese.  Don't waste your time trecking to this place."}
{"text":"Food is ok, good thing is that the noodles is fresh which is why my chinese food likes to come here. Mostly Chinese food people eat here (non Vietnamese people). I have eaten at better places as I am Vietnamese and like Authentic food. I think Pho Tai Bac in Richmond Hill and Pho Metro in Scarborough is much better, cheaper and more authentic. You get better value & portions too."}
{"text":"May 1, 2018 - This was always my go to spot every weekend. The portions are very good (they give you more than enough meat or at least that's what I think)..   So far I've tried the Lemongrass Chicken, House Special & Two Style Beef Pho. They are all very good.  Today I bought a small Two Style Beef Pho, I was so stuffed.  It tasted so good with hoisin sauce and sriracha sauce."}
{"text":"Was in the area at the time, came in and got our seats real quickly and even got our food really quick. Ventilation is not the greatest as you WILL leave smelling like a big vat of pho broth lol.  What we ordered: - Pho with brisket and beef balls - Broken rice with 3 meats: chicken, pork & beef - Grilled squid  The pho broth is really good but of course not authentic because it's Chinese run so I'm not a huge fan. The broken rice was good, rice was fluffy but the beef was really tough, chicken and pork were easier to cut through and the squid was good too.  They only accept debit and cash so better have those ready lol or else you'll be in a huge pickle."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Pho. Now as fair warning, this place is definitely less authentically Vietnamese, as Chinese-owend and operated, but I still like how it tastes here.  I know the House Pho is popular here but I usually just stick with Rare Beef. (You can choose from a variety of toppings or go with House: rare beef, brisket, beef ball, tripe and tendon) The broth is really tasty, and topped with onion and green onion. They use thicker rice noodles here, which you may or may not prefer over traditional pho noodles. Please note: the large really is quite large.  I also enjoy getting the vermicielli with lemon grass chicken sometimes, especially in the Summer when I might not feel like having a hot bowl of pho. The chicken is well-marinated and grilled, and the pickled vegetables mixed with the vermicelli is refreshing.  You write your order down yourself using the menu numbers and hand it off to a server. Overall the place is pretty good. Food is yummy, cleanliness is ok, servers are quick (especially if you speack Chinese), and cost is pretty cheap (~$8)"}
{"text":"This restaurant gives me a very nostalgic feeling and I guess my unusually high rating can be attributed to that. But that aside, their pho isn't all that bad. I actually like it, and their seafood fried rice is really good in my opinion. The prices are reasonable, too. It's very much a hit or miss, though, based on your taste preferences and your past experiences with pho. I've been coming to this restaurant with my family for a long time, so obviously I'm satisfied. You might as well try it once to see if it satisfies you too."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea. More chinese than vietnamese in my opinion. I think Pho Metro is better."}
{"text":"Vietnam Noodle was one place I use to go to often. However after the upgrade of the restaurant, the quality of the food and the service downgraded. The portions of the food are still  quite big; however,the quality of food isn't that great. For example,the pho that I ordered wasn't hot enough; thus the raw beef didn't cook properly. Also, the noodles in the pho was definitely overcooked."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to go to for pho. Their large size pho is huge and it's cheap! I would recommend adding ketchup beef brisket stew as one of the ingredients in your pho. It makes a world of difference in the soup base. It might sound weird at first but trust me, you have to give it a try!"}
{"text":"3.5  I've been coming here for a while and this is the first time I'm writing a review. Their food tastes good and it is cheap.   I ordered the raw beef pho, $7 for a small. Their noodles are good, they have good portions of meat (most of the time) and they are thinly sliced so it cooks in the soup. I've been to places where their beef was cut too thick and that didn't turn out too well. I really like their broth here. It isn't too salty. However, I'm always parched after eating their noodles. I down an entire bottle of water and still want more. This isn't preventing me from coming back though.   The service is typical of asian restaurants. The waiters aren't in the best mood or that polite but they take your order quickly (once you're able to flag one down) and food comes out quick if your order pho. The rice dishes take a bit longer to prepare and to be honest, they're not as good as their pho.   Overall, food is good and cheap. Service is a bit lacking and it can be hard to flag down a waiter."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here, and I usually get the house special pho.  It can be busy sometimes, but the service is still very fast.  Reasonable prices & good pho  The mango \"milkshake\" is pretty good too, but it's more like a slush with condensed milk or something.  The food other than the pho isn't as great though, but my friends say the pineapple rice is good."}
{"text":"Cheap and huge portions of food! This is one of my regular spots to go to for pho. Even though it's always busy, the food arrives pretty quickly. The best deal is the large pho for $7.99-$9.99 (depending on the number of toppings you choose). It's enough for two people. The broth tastes best with the beef brisket in my opinion.   I also tried the pineapple fried rice which serves the rice inside a pineapple. Interesting idea but I was a bit disappointed. I thought it would have more of a pineapple flavour in it but it tasted like mediocre fried rice. They added regular hot dogs in the fried rice rather than the Chinese sausage that's traditionally in the fried rice. I probably wouldn't order that again.  All in all, this is my go to place for pho. Quick service, good pho, big portions - the three things I love in a restaurant!"}
{"text":"This has been my holy grail, go-to Pho joint for as long as I can remember. I've been coming here for over 12 years now, and I always walk away satisfied and full. There's something about the combination of the broth and noodles that makes it different from other Pho restaurants. It is absolutely delicious and I cannot recommend this place enough.   I usually get the rare beef noodle soup, sometimes with beef balls, sometimes with tendon. Their honey garlic chicken wings are an old favourite of mine (How do they get it so crispy?!). I also usually get the baby bok choy in a garlic sauce, which never seems to disappoint.   I moved away from Scarborough about 6 years ago, and this place is one of the things I miss most about my hometown."}
{"text":"*WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT*    Any restaurant visit that's followed by multiple unpleasant visits to the loo deserves less than 1 star in my opinion but since Yelp does not have 0 or minus star rating system, I'll leave it at 1 star.  After reading many decent reviews, my husband and I went for a lunch on a Saturday.  As many reviewers noted, the parking lot was pretty busy but the restaurant wasn't quiet full when we arrived.    We were seated promptly and upon studying the menu (unlike any other Pho menu I've seen with choices of broth, meat, noodles...etc), we ordered a large house special pho and a 2 meat (rare beef and cooked beef) pho with Tom Yum broth.    Both dishes came out pretty quickly and since the large size here really means a large, we were able to share a healthy amount of both dishes.  The house special pho had a little bit of everything (rare beef, cooked beef, tripe, beef balls and some other organ meat I did not recognize) and there was a slight funk to the broth.  I wonder if the funk was due to the organ meats in the soup but who knows.  The noodles seemed like the fresh kind and broader than I prefer.  The noodles soaked up most of the broth pretty quickly so we were left with no broth towards the middle of our meal.  The one beef ball that I bit into was undercooked and I promptly spat it out.    The Tom Yum broth with rare and cooked meat tasted pretty good at first but for some reason, I found myself liking it less and less as the meal went on.  The cooked meat (brisket?) was very chewy and the rare beef was fattier than what I was used to getting.  The broth and the noodle ratio suffered the same fate as the other pho dish.  We had eaten through less than half a bowl of noodles and there was virtually no broth left.    The trouble started soon after for both of us, having to visit the loo multiple times for rest of the day.  We have since agreed that VNS does not deserve another visit and will probably stick to that decision."}
{"text":"Not authentic Pho, but as a bowl of noodles, tastes great.  Their noodles are on the soft side but the broth and quality of the rare beef is well above most Pho places."}
{"text":"Ordered:  Pho/ spring rolls/vietnamese fried rice/ fried pork chop/chicken wings/Malaysian pork bone soup/seafood laksa.  Malaysian soup, $8.99- not worth it. Spring rolls, $5.99- not worth it. Chicken wings, $12.99, never worth it!  Everything else tasted ok.  Their fried rice/noodles, $8.99, came in big portions.   Service sucks!  Non-smiling ladies with attitudes worse than their grilled squid! They just give you the aura that customers \"enslave\" them by eating there.    They are \"idiotic\" to feel that way, without patrons, this place won't have a need for lousy waitresses!  I will order take-out next time; their Vietnamese fried rice really taste good."}
{"text":"Run by Chinese people but still decent to satisfy any Pho cravings you might have. The restaurant is very large and spacious. There is a lot of parking but when I got there on a week day for lunch parking lot was already pretty full. Service is quick and the best part about this place is that you can choose what meats you want in the noodles."}
{"text":"Not one of the best places to have pho, or any dish actually. What I've noticed with their dishes is they are too salty & normally have one dominating flavour.   I've had the pho a couple of times & don't enjoy the noodles or the soup base. The soup base is too salty, or it's never flavourful enough. Even when adding siracha or hoisin sauce, it doesn't get much better.   For a while I was pescatarian & opted to eat one of the two dishes on the menu that was seafood only. The thai style shrimp paste fried rice (the name always changes for some reason). It has a kick of spice, with shrimp, peas & fish flakes on top. But this dish is way too salty. Despite the salt it's still better than the other dishes.   A friend of mine had vermicelli, her meal of choice at Vietnamese restaurants, and was heavily disappointed. The noodles were too dry, there wasn't enough meat or vegetables & the spring rolls weren't great.   Only thing good about this place is the portions are good for the price."}
{"text":"Haven't been back here for several years, and I guess over time some places do change for better or for worse. In my personal experience it was for worse.   I came for lunch with my fam, we ordered pho and I got myself a vermicelli with chicken and spring rolls. First initial bites in the vermicelli the noodles were dry, the chicken didn't have much flavor and the spring roll was under cooked. Everything about the bowl was pretty disappointing. It's didn't taste good and would probably never order that again.   The pho was just alright.. It had a standard soup broth taste at most chinese style pho places but the beef was pretty bad. Usually when you get pho they give you thin slices of beef and are easier to chew with the noodles. Man, I was chewing for like 5 mins on that beef! They gave poor quality beef and that just ruined the whole experience. If I hadn't eaten pho for like 5 years and I came to this place to eat it then maybe I would think it's god food or something....   Wasn't too happy with there food this time around. Don't think I will be coming here for vietnamese anytime soon."}
{"text":"One of the usual places I go to for my pho fix. The one thing I really love about this place is the fast service and waiting time is usually quite short. I have dined here countless times and have never been disappointed.   The pho is pretty fresh, the broth is what's important though and I thought it was a good balance and not too salty either. There is the choices of small, large and extra large. They have the usual house special which includes everything or there's choice of one, two or three ingredients. Price is affordable as well.   Another favourite of mines is the Malaysian Chicken Curry with rice. The price is pretty good for the portion. I really enjoy it because there is actually some spice to it. I also usually get the cold hk milk tea with my meal which isn't too bad either.   Worth going to and trying out. Maybe you'll frequent it as much as I do."}
{"text":"Time to go to Vietnam.... by midland and finch! I'm surprised I didn't write a review for this...... oh well. This place's pho is amazing! Huge portions and the meat is by far one of the best I've had! Prices for the special have gone up by a dollar sadly. Although that's ok since it comes with a lot and is very tasty! Since they give you an option of what you can add to your Pho I just add Raw beef and Cooked beef. I haven't tried much of their other food, BUT I have tried the indonesian fried rice and it's amazing! I love it so much for the taste, price, and portion! Their drinks are quite good and larger now!   The parking lot can be hell on earth during certain times ie lunch! maybe weekends too! The place can be super duper packed on lunch/ or weekends."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I constantly go back to because there's that comfort food feel that they provide. It is far from the best pho place but the price is great.  Staff: The staff are not very attentive and we usually have to flag them down a few times. Sometimes they don't even notice you standing at the front waiting to be seated.  Ambience: It's ok. The seats are your average chairs and they tried to maximize the amount of tables so it's a little more crammed than I'd prefer but still enough room to walk with ease if you needed to go to the washroom.  Food: I feel like they have great broth, but they lack noodles in my humble opinion. I think they tried to compensate by adding more broth and more onions, which I don't care too much for. Their beef balls are pretty small too. But everything tastes pretty good so that's probably why I come back. The price is on the cheaper side for the area.  Taste great, just wish they had better portion sizes."}
{"text":"This place is immensely popular among folks living in Agincourt. The restaurant itself is large, though when I arrived at around noon on a weekday it wasn't too busy.  I looked at the menu and wanted to order something that's more than just regular pho. I noticed the South Asian section of the menu and saw lemongrass beef noodle soup. Not sure how that's South Asian, but I decided to order it regardless as well as an iced lemon tea.  The food came at an okay speed, however slower than usual compared to other Pho/Vietnamese noodle places. As expected I didn't feel any \"South Asian\" feel to it, as it was just regular Pho soup with lemongrass beef instead of sliced beef. Judging strictly from the food it was A-OK, as 3-star reviews put it. Nothing too special that will make me wanna come back immediately. but nothing that I would vehemently decide I would never come back.  Service was, well, typical of Asian restaurants. Price is what matters at the end when it comes to these establishments."}
{"text":"TBH this is probably my favourite pho place in the markham/Scarborough area. Price, quality, and portion wise, this one beats all the other ones. Service is very quick and efficient so I never have to spend more then 40 minute here (slow eater). The soup base is less oily then some of other ones I've been to which is good when you craving some good soup base. Not much more I can say about this place since I'm here so often, I've probably gone numb t that first experience/reaction thing. Overall, must have when craving pho. No place else."}
{"text":"I come here quite often since it's close in proximity. I recommend the chicken kebabs! I definitely do not recommend the chocolate mousse cake and the cheese cake, the portions were tiny. I probably finished it in 5 bites. The chocolate mousse cake looked and tasted like ones you find at grocery stores by Mccain."}
{"text":"We checked this place out for the first time. The quality of the meat in the soup was low and our order was wrong. The wait staff ignored us and then demanded a tip. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the House Special Pho with spring rolls as a side dish. The soup base is mediocre but the noodles, meat and vegetables are very fresh. Spring rolls are a bit too greasy. Lots of variety on the menu, there's also an option in which you can choose what meats you want to add to your pho or rice. Great place to eat with a group of friends or even family."}
{"text":"Personally, my favourite pho place nearby. Service is quick. They use fresh noodles which I prefer and portions are generous. The meat is higher quality in comparison to some of the other places that I've been to."}
{"text":"Ahhh, this lovely place. I've been eating here since I was a kid and has had many fond memories with my family and friends. The place has been expanded and renovated over the year but the taste remains fairly intact. I've been here probably over a hundred times in my life and I always get the special beef pho and spring rolls, never disappoint!!!   Overall = 4 stars Nostalgia = add 1 more star"}
{"text":"most delicious pho I have ever eaten. the rice paper rolls come with pickled carrot and radish for an extra kick!"}
{"text":"Pros: Create your own pho Large seating area  Cons: Service can be slow when busy  Vietnam Noodle Star has been a staple at the Finch and Midland Plaza for as long as I can remember.  My family doctor used to be in the building next door so I've been coming here as long as I can remember.  The one thing I like about this location is the ability to pick which toppings go in your pho. Almost every other pho place let's you do this.  You can pick between 1-3 toppings for every bowl.  The prices are pretty fair for the portions you get.  They also have a lot of rice dishes here which are very well done.  I do like the curries they have here when I'm not feeling noodles.  This place has a ton of seating which works for it and against it sometimes.  Because of the large amount of seating and the quick turnover time for pho, you rarely have to wait too long for a table even when it's super busy.  They do have a lot of staff on hand, but when it gets really busy it can be tough getting help. I've had to wait 15 minutes once just to pay my bill.  It was like they were daring me to dine and dash.  lol.  Overall, this is a very solid pho place to go when you have that craving. I won;t go as far as to say it's the best, but it's pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Great food, my favourite although the this place is saltier than the other places I go. It's why it's my favourite. Their fresh rice noodles are a staple and actual rare beef is what keeps a lot of people coming back.   I definitely recommend anything lemongrass on the menu. The service is quick and portions are fantastic, especially if you're hungry. If you haven't tried this place I'd definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"The service has really gone down after a few years, the pho doesn't have the flavor in the broth and the bean sprouts that they give with the pho noodles are not as fresh as they used to serve"}
{"text":"This is simply the best Pho Noodle Soup I ever had. I had it with raw beef and beef tendon, which is what I typically get. The beef and tendon were very plentiful, which is more than I can say for a lot of the different pho restaurants I have been to. The broth was flavorful and there was little need to use the hot sauce or the peanut hoison sauce. However, the hoison sauce was delicious and I just couldn't resist it.   The staff were very friendly, especially the lovely young woman serving me tonight. I requested a fork shortly after I got my soup. My carpal tunnel doesn't allow me to hold chop sticks for very long anymore, and she was very kind about it. It was such a lovely late night experience.  We also got a mango milkshake. It tasted like I was eating a fresh mango. It was delicious!   Reading the reviews on here and looking at the photos make me want to go back really badly, especially to try the mango coconut dessert (yes I really do love mangoes!)"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite Pho spot! I guess it's also personal preference, but I love the fresh thick noodles that they use for their Pho as opposed to the thin dry ones many other places use. I love their broth as well, rich and always comes out piping hot! My favourite order is the beef (cooked) noodle soup because the beef they use is the nice thick kind with a layer of fat which is so soft it melts in the mouth. The house special is good too and they don't skim you on ingredients. The bowl is always full to the rim.  Also tried their chicken wings, house special fried rice and pineapple fried rice and all were really delicious. I've once been a Pho explorer and set out to try as many places in the GTA as I can looking for the best Pho and I've for sure found my favourite. No other Pho place makes me crave pho more than this place! Service is also exceptionally fast. If you want a quick in and out, here is the place to go! Must try!"}
{"text":"Grew up eating here since the late 90s...   This place transformed from a small noodle restaurant, to medium, bought another store, and expanded  The price is awesome and you do pay for what you get   Great for something you want to fill your belly quickly and go"}
{"text":"This is a chinese take on Vietnamese, and other Southeast Asian food. You will be hard pressed to find any vietnamese words on the menu. So, it's not very authentic, but it was still tasty. As well, portions were quite generous for the price. Service was pretty quick for the most part, but I wish that the servers served our food together. My mother was already half way done her meal by the time mine was brought to my table.  I got the Sam Sik Fan and I didn't pay attention to the english name, it was \"three kinds of meat with rice\". Usually though, this dish name should be a fried egg, a pork cutlet, and steamed quiche with rice on the side. So it was very different seeing it served this way... The meats were tasty. Except the pork cutlet was very hard, dry, and maybe even burnt. But it was very filling for $9.99. I also got two orders of iced milk tea, which was $3.50 each, which I found sort of pricey as there was a lot of ice, not much drink. The glass the drinks were served in were also not very clean, I could see some sort of white residue on the surface... Wasn't pleased by this either and made me feel this place is not too clean."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few months ONLY for the soup. I don't know why I was supporting a restaurant and kept coming if the service was just ASS!!! All their servers are so goddamn rude and hostile that I can't even ask for water? Aside from that I've been tipping them every visit YET this lady had the audacity to tell me that I NEVER TIP THEM uhm ....... Nope rather go get my pho somewhere else. WORST PLACE.   In conclusion, if I could give them no stars I would. Spend your money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"One of the best eats in the Midland/Finch area. Very diverse menu ranging from pho to curry dishes and other great Vietnamese meals. Great price points, fast and friendly service, and a very relaxing place overall."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. By far the best pho place in town!! I've been a loyal customer for over a decade :3 I always come to this place when I need a quick pho fix.  Food is always served HOT and quality is very consistent. Service is courteous and EXTREMELY FAST. Even when I place an order for take out, food is literally ready for pick up the second I put down the phone... I'm serious lol!  I have pretty much tried most of the items on the menu, and there isn't really anything I dislike :) Prices are reasonable... but there are certain items on the menu I would probably not order. Ex. Vietnamese/Thai Assorted Plates - for that kind of price, I can order 3 more bowls of pho lol. But don't get me wrong, the sampler platters are delicious, plus you can try all their specialty appetizers all in one.  Some of my all time favourite dishes:  1. Pho with cooked beef - why cooked beef? This location gives you the fatter and juicier meat when you order cooked beef compared to the leaner meat when you order raw beef. Found this out by accident hahaha. You can change your beef soup base to chicken (no extra cost) AND curry, satay or tom yum (for $1 more). You may wish to change the pho noodles to glass noodles (more chewy!) for $0.50 more too :)  2. Vietnamese fried noodles - aka pho without the soup. Most satisfying, must-order item! It is packed with flavours and is made with chicken, pork and shrimps. Yea, it doesn't look too appealling in photos, but it tastes great!  3. Seafood Laksa Noodles - curry and coconut soup base with both rice noodles and thick yellow egg noodles! Smells so delicious, has a bit of a kick, and I can't stop eating it lol. I'm not a big fan of the egg noodles but the rice noodle is fantastic in this dish... it soaks up all the flavours of the creamy soup!  4. Thai Boneless Chicken Feet - spicy and sour, this appetizer is quite addictive lol. Not everyone might like them but they are surely my fave! Give them a try.... only if you're feeling adventurous ;)  I often recommend my patients to eat here if they want something quick, satisfying and cheap ;) I would highly recommend it to pho hunters out there... this is definitely one of the better pho places in Toronto :D Happy pho eating!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't consider that this place is authentic viet  pho but if it was just considered a regular bowl of noodles I would say that the broth is very flavourful and each bowl is loaded with ingredients. Compared to other pho restaurants the price is rather cheaper and they give you a big portion. I really enjoy their milkshakes and skewers !! The staff can be rude at times but food is always served super quick !"}
{"text":"Been coming here since high school, they have very experienced servers and their food is pretty darn good.   The noodles in the pho are the flat, wider soft rice noodles and the soup here is reaaaally good too.   I would also recommend people try the mango sticky rice dessert. That ones reaaaal good."}
{"text":"My parents love this place cause they put in a lot of noodles. IMO, this is my least favourite place for pho. The quality of meat they put in is poor - beef is very fatty and stale. The broth isn't even clear and flavourful compared to other pho.   Ordered a roti that cost me $2.5. It was legit one roti... that got microwaved. Not worth it!!!  Service here is terrible. Didn't say thanks or anything when we gave them more than enough tips."}
{"text":"Cheap, quick and good. Best chinese style pho (according to my family and friends).   - $9.99 for a large house special - $7.99 for a small (only 2 sizes) - You can customize your pho too.  As soon as you enter the restaurant, you are seated right away. Pho orders arrive in less than 5 minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"Was craving pho, and I had wanted to check this place or for a while now so I was happy to be able to finally make it.   The place has a lot of seating so we didn't wait very long for seats. Although on a night like tonight, there weren't many patrons anyways.   Service was efficient, but again, there weren't many customers.   I ordered the small house special for under $10. It came really fast and you got a decent quantity of beef.  However, there was only one beef ball.  I enjoyed it.   Two negatives: tea was lukewarm and the pho was hot, but not piping hot. On s snowy, cold evening, I would have appreciated a hot bowl of pho!"}
{"text":"Solid pho! Good amount of beef balls as that's the only noodle soup I order lol $7 for a good portion, I approve!"}
{"text":"I ordered the bian hoi. The noodles were too soggy and the meat didn't taste fresh.. but it was tolerable. If we only had the bian hoi I would rate this place 2/5 but my friends got the pho too. Rather than using soup, they used WATER. IMAGINE PHO BUT WATER INSTEAD OF BROTH. It was so bland and flavourless. My friends had to use so much hot sauce just to make it taste like something.  To make matters worse, one of the servers pressured my friend for a larger tip. When he refused, she immediately started complaining in front of us."}
{"text":"We came here on New Years Eve, and when we first sat down, there was only one table seated. By the time we left, the place was packed with people - small and large groups. This is considered one of your average Vietnamese restaurants. They have their pho, curries, vermicelli. What we enjoyed about this restaurant was the selection and the quality of food. Everything was super tasty - especially the beef satay skewers. Moist, tender meat and a flavorful onion and garlic dipping sauce. The green thai curry was tasty when dipped with bread."}
{"text":"Tldr: Good variety of dishes on the menu, fast, cheap, good portions, wished for friendlier staff but would recommend the food.   Vietnam noodle star is a decent place to get your favourite Vietnamese dishes. Of course they offer pho and vermicelli, but they also have pad thai, curries, fried rices, rice combos, and rotis for you to order as well. I come here often either with my friends or my family, as it's cheap and the portions are huge.   When i come here, i either get the house special pho or the  ketchup beef brisket stew. If i don't want noodle-soups, i'll go for the three kinds of meat with rice (in Chinese it's creatively called 3 colors rice, includes lemongrass chicken, pork, and beef). The house special will satisfy your pho cravings as their broth is pretty flavourful, and they slap good amounts of beef toppings to make sure you're full. The ketchup beef brisket stew is pretty legit as well. It's a rich, tomato based soup that comes with loads of soft, tender beef briskets that will easily break down in your mouth. If you're not feeling traditional pho, i highly recommend this option.    Service here is quick and speedy, but the waiters seem rude and look pretty pissed all the time. If they were more friendly i'd probably give this place a higher rating. The restaurant has a lot of room so you don't feel super cramped when eating during busy hours as well. They are also relatively accommodating for larger groups. Opens late, would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Vietnamese Noodle STAR STAR STAR STAR!   This is one of my go-to's in the area. It has a lot of seats so you don't usually have to wait long. Although there are a lot of staff, it's sometimes difficult to get service.   I usually order 1110 (the large special phone). Be warned - it is quite large! Be prepared for a filling meal. The broth is above average - nothing too rich, but not salty either. I usually leave pretty happy.   Some of the other stuff I've ordered are the fried rice items, the spring rolls, the cold drinks, and the pork chop. All of them come out quickly and are surprisingly good. I'm usually pretty satisfied regardless of what we choose so feel free to be adventurous!   All in all, a great bang for buck place that tastes good."}
{"text":"Read such great reviews and thought I should try it. I came today for lunch, and was not satisfied. My pho tasted like nothing, and I spotted a piece of hair in my food.... Im hoping to give it another try another time? Maybe the broth was just bad today.   Spring rolls are good. & they give a lot of noodles, and meat!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   We came here for the pho as my friends have been here regularly and said it's pretty good so I gave it a try in lieu of the usual pho 88. The menu here is pretty different for the pho than what i'm accustomed to - you not only pick the ingredients but you also pick the type of noodle and the noodle base (e.g., tom yum soup-base...which really isnt pho). For the ingredients, you can pick beef balls, beef tendon, raw beef, cooked beef, or their special that has everything. Each ingredient added has an additional charge, whereas the special is a set price. I wanted the fatty beef, but i wasn't sure if the cooked beef was fatty, so i got tendon...and it really was just tendon, which i wasn't actually too crazy about. They have fresh noodles instead of dried noodles, which i think is the big draw to the place.  The soup base was good, no complaints at all. The price point is decent. We also ordered to chicken wing, which was good as well. Not a bad place to come."}
{"text":"You don't come here for 5-star service and decor because you definitely won't get it, nor are you paying for it. I like the food - not the best pho I've ever had, but it gets the job done when that's what I want to eat. The main reasons why I go here is that the place is fast, reasonably priced, and close by - all things which I value greatly. It gets 4/5 stars because I have had a bowl of bland pho here once before.  Today I had takeout, but in the past I've dined in on several occasions. I had the Pineapple & Sausage Fried Rice, Malaysian Curry Chicken on Rice, and Lemon Grass Chicken Fillet with Shrimp on Sugar Cane served with Vermicelli. I really liked the fried rice even though I misread the menu and was confused as to why there were hotdog-looking pieces of meat mixed about. The curry had a good heat to it without being overwhelming and was very smooth. The vermicelli mix was pretty normal and nothing special, but still a solid dish."}
{"text":"I can't compare this place to others within the Scarborough region, but the pho itself was really tasty. The soup broth came out nice a hot to ensure the raw beef cooks completely. The portion is average compared to downtown locations and the North York area. I found the the broth was tastier than the average  too which helps.   The restaurant had one large TV screen that showed a Korean drama dubbed in Cantonese, which I found quite interesting since that's all you hear throughout the restaurant. The dining area itself is nice and clean and has this contemporary feel to it too.   The part that didn't let me give this place a 5 would be the fact the avocado slush tasted more like watered down avocado. I suppose it was a mistake on my end not ordering the typical smoothie, but I figured this would be a lighter and colder version if it. Overall, I wasn't a fan of it so I didn't get to finish it. Oh well, lesson learned."}
{"text":"I am here again to write another review for Vietnam Noodle Star because of Pho-bruary!  Today I am having a late lunch around 2:30 pm and the restaurant still half full... That is really a good sign for somewhere that does not have lunch special/afternoon tea special or whatever specials!  I order the small pho with raw beef as my last visit. Today I notice the noodle is the fresh one, Amen! The broth is still tasty and still has that anise taste in it which is unique compare to other places.  I have to minus a star today because of the bean sprout they provided. They looks like days old, greyish colour.. and the basil leaves looks like something they get from the bottom of the barrel....  If you notice, everyone else are ordering the Pho but nothing else.. I will definitely suggest people to stay away from other dishes! especially anything that is deep fried!  Nothing beat a hot bowel of Pho on a cold winter day! :)"}
{"text":"Average pho but big servings though. I guess when you've been to so many vietnamese restaurants, you can't really tell the difference anymore between the dishes unless you're a real vietnamese or something. I've been here thrice already and it's one of the places I go to everytime I'm craving for some pho or vermicelli."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one night and got a small pho with raw beef.   The thick noodles were delicious and the broth was decent, but not brag-worthy.  It's definitely much cheaper than the other pho places I've been to, and for that reason I'd probably come back. Service was quick, which is always a bonus."}
{"text":"Price here is super cheap! Lots of food for what you pay for. Broth here is alright depending on your expectation. Service is great even though it can be super busy at key times."}
{"text":"I think people come here for the big portion. I admit the large size of pho contains a lot of meat and noodle, but, you can't sacrifice quantity over quality. The soup is not hot enough, the beef quality is not good including The beef in the noodle and the beef with rice."}
{"text":"As luck would have it, a friend lives close by so there's always an excuse to come here.  Cheap and cheerful, and good value to boot.   Honestly, they are doing exactly what the  5 billion other pho places in the GTA are doing...but it all comes together and just works here: neon green walls, ghetto weird bar seating in the middle of the restaurant, mega portions and the chaos typical of a place packing em in.   It actually works."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times in the past, and I can honestly say that the service here has left such a bad impression on me that I have been refusing to eat here ever since.   The pho itself is overly salty, but other than that it is okay.  Service wise this restaurant is a mess. It is difficult to grab the server's attention (the restaurant can get kinda busy, so I will give them that), and it is definitely more of a no-frills type of service. I can usually live with that, no problem. So why the bad review?  Let me express that I always tip. It doesn't matter how bad the service is - I always tip. I came here with a large group of friends sometime in the winter, and we all paid and gave tips to the server. She comes to collect our payment and returns to ask for more tip. Considering that the only service she gave us was getting orders and putting noodles on the table, we thought she deserved the standard amount of tip. None of us skimped out, so the fact that she was demanding for more tip money when she did not provide good enough service for a higher amount greatly irritated me. Would she have asked us for more if we were older customers or did she treat us this way because we were young? I won't be returning to find out.  The food is not good enough to make me ever want to come here again. I'd recommend going to Pho Vietnam in the plaza next door instead as they have both better food and service."}
{"text":"Viet food... but not really.. thats the best i can describe it.  its not authentic by any means.  Big portions and tender meat in the pho keeps me coming back.  But nothing about it seems to be authentic Vietnamese when it comes to taste.  Pros: Portion size, Price, customization (including ketchup brisket as a meat)  Cons: Not authentic Vietnamese by any means, service, skewers left in meat dishes, greasy and heavy pho, and you wont find grilled meats or char taste here.    The dishes have been modified to satisfy the more of the Chinese customers i would say.  Quantity over quality.  Meats on the rice are NOT grilled, you wont find that authentic char taste here.  I have been coming here for years, and finally decided to order new things.  The beef dish i ordered which was suppose to be beef tenderloin cubes had literally a chopped bamboo skewer in the middle of every cube.  Very unacceptable.   If this was my first time coming here i would have gave it 1 star.    Clearly they took a beef skewer and did not even take the skewer out ...  just chopped it up and covered it with sauce.  It could have stabbed a small child or grandmas mouth.  Please see pics."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 15 years, and needless to say I've befriended almost all the employees here. This is still my go-to number one pho place, their soup isn't salty, no msg, and the perfect blend. They also have decent prices, and the best part, they've been nothing but consistent with their portions over the many years I've been here.   Service is quick, but don't expect smiles and chat unless you're a frequent customer. Don't be put down by this, their food is still great!"}
{"text":"Food was alright but service was horrible. The waitress demanded more tips to be paid when I was paying my bill. Also there is a fee to use the card machine."}
{"text":"This place, what to say? From memory it's been around since, possibly forever. The decor inside can be described as simple and homey. The seating area is quite roomie and there's a couple big circle tables to sit large parties. Can't say the staff stood out, they were busy and didn't pay too much attention which was expected.  For the food, there's quite a selection on the menu. From soup noodles, to rice, to appetizers and snacks. Not the best pho soup in town but decent enough for return visits. The snacks and appetizers were pretty good, will definitely order them again. The fried chicken wings were still crispy even when covered in the honey garlic sauce. The pork neck had a slight grilled bbq flavour. The portions were huge but not overly filling, for the price it was worth it. The pork chop was a bit on the dry side and paired with rice, not something to try again.  Overall, this is a family spot that will be visited again. Relatives visiting from Hong Kong really enjoy their beef broth."}
{"text":"Not my favourite type of noodles but the beef here is great in quality and quantity and the soup base is very strong tasting. I don't usually get anything other than Pho though so take that with a grain of salt."}
