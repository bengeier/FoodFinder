{"text":"I didn't try the food. The driver/owner?? was incredibly rude and left her massive, uncovered generator running during our entire car show!! It was so loud half the show was unable to hear anything, and she refused to use the electrical hookup we provided!! When she was told it was a problem, she said tell the manager! Only a few people got food there, so I don't know if it was any good, mostly she just stood outside of it smoking. Rude and snotty!"}
{"text":"I discovered this food truck on the streets of downtown Las Vegas. I wasn't very hungry so I stood aside while all my friends ordered their food. But as their food started to come out I couldn't resist making my own order. I got the carne asada quesadilla with guac and sour cream. The meat was delicious. The only draw back I have is that it could've had more cheese. The guacamole was very good and fresh. I asked for a side of salsa verde. It was very clearly homemade and spicier than most places, which to me is a plus. I tried my friends burrito which was also very good. In addition to the good food the truck is ran by a very nice woman and her mother who does all the cooking. They were very kind and helpful. I'll definitely be finding this truck again to try their Cuban sandwich."}
{"text":"The food is discusting, I ordered a burrito and the beans were spoilled, and the rice was under cooked. We end up throwing the food into the trash. Worst place ever!!! I have to select a start in order to post my comment!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good fresh Mexican and Cuban food. The great thing is its owned by a Cuban so you know its authentic. The menu is sort but sweet..and they even serve Cuban coffee."}
