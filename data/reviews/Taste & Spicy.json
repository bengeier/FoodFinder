{"text":"Had the Mutton briyani for 5.99$, awesome deal for that price but the best part of it all was the food quality. \" Chef Bavan\" definitely knows what he's doing , not your regular Tamil briyani where the rice would be soaking in oil. Would definitely go back to try out the kothu , 5."}
{"text":"New establishment in this area and the quality for the price you pay is not parallel. For under $6 you can walk out with something that looks so gourmet. The mutton biryani had a very distinct taste and so did the kothu roti.

High quality . Low price. You do the math for easy choice for Sri Lankan food!"}
{"text":"Summary: new South Asian little spot serves spicy mutton and chicken goods that pack heat!

Top Must-Get: mutton
Top Regret: chicken patty

This place apparently opened six months ago (October 2016) but I only recently noticed it after a Domino's pizza run! It's nestled in an easy-to-miss plaza and doesn't face the main road, but it's two units down from Domino's.

It serves South Asian and Sri Lankan goods, and was empty when we stumbled across it at 9 pm on a Sunday. Eventually another person ordered something there too, but I don't think the location is very noticeable.

First time there, I only grabbed a mutton roll and chicken patties. It took under 10 minutes for the order to come out. The staff person seemed slightly taken aback by our arrival but was friendly.

Mutton roll was $1. Chicken patty is normally more, but since I originally wanted chicken roll, they just charged me $1 (and got three mini samosa looking patties...)

The mutton roll was VERY oily but still tasted delicious; packed with meaty, gamey goodness with a bit of heat.

Chicken patty was also super oily and packed MORE heat than the mutton roll but was not as flavourful. The chicken was bland and dull tasting.

Will be back to try the biryani!"}
{"text":"Awesome hidden gems that offers real authentic Tamil food. You could ask the chef to make it on the spicy side or not. Best mutton kothu roti in the city and awesome value for the price. It was $6 with tax. Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"Noticed good reviews on this place and decided to check it out. This place is hidden, at the rear side of the plaza where it is located. It is a small establishment. The is maybe about 2 or 3 small tables and can probably seat around 6 people. However this place is more of a takeout place. I ordered their Chicken Biryani for takeout. It was delicious and good portion for $5.99 + tax. Came with sliced eggs on the bed of rice and small container of salad on the side."}
{"text":"Wish I knew this place existed before.. food is on point especially for the price ! Amazing buriyani!"}
