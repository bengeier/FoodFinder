{"text":"I go there for lunch sometimes. I have to say its good home-cooked Italian food. You can pick an choose what you want and the owners are really friendly. Oh ya, very reasonably priced in comparison for places around and quick."}
{"text":"Imagine visiting Grandma and Grandpa and having that home cooked meal while sitting down on the 30 year couches still covered in plastic. Grandpa's still smiling and happy to see you, and so are you. You wonder why it took you so long to be back and how good the food is, especially the home style pizza, so good who cares about calorie count and portion sizes, i'm having 3rds. I'll be back sooner than later for that espresso and pizza because it feels good while i'm here, even if the remote is covered in wrap."}
{"text":"This little place is the definition of a hidden gem. The husband and wife team (she's Nancy) make Italian food as down home as it gets. The daily lunch plate consists of an average side plate filled with everything they have in the hot table for a very reasonable $9 or $10. And all of it is amazing."}
