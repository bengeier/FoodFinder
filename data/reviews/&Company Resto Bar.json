{"text":"We were invited last week to attend a new menu tasting event at &Company Resto Bar in Mississauga (across from Square One Shopping Center).

First impressions were that this restaurant is HUGE. It's a good spot if you are looking to throw a large-group party or corporate event dinner. They definitely have room to accommodate large groups for dinner and drinks.

The menu is set up with shareable appetizers as well as traditional entrees. We tried a variety of starters, all which ranged from $13.50 to $16.50.

First, we tried the Louisiana Shrimp Po Boys. This sharable serving came with three Po boy sliders, along with a helping of fries. The shrimp were lightly spiced instead of battered like a traditional po'boy sandwich, and were served with creole tartar sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. The buns were a bit oversized for the shrimp in the sandwiches. Something tells me they are better suited for the hamburger sliders also on the menu.

Next up for appetizers is the Charcuterie Flatbread. This was a great value! The flatbread that came to our table was the size of a small pizza. Each of us had a few pieces, which is a great size for an appetizer. As a big fan of a traditional charcuterie board I was interested in trying this out, and was pleasantly surprised. The meat was not overpowered by the cheese, tomato and sauce base on the flatbread. Would highly recommend this one!

Traditional entrees were next... I tried the Surf n Turf, a new menu item, which was $29. I really liked the unique presentation, which each item set up on a long board instead of a traditional steak and potatoes plate. The steak was cooked exactly as I requested. The lobster tail was a generous size, and the lemon-garlic butter sauce wasn't overpowering at all. It was cooked perfectly too and was very meaty.

Unfortunately, the double cheese baked potato was very dry. It seems like they are premade and had cheese, asparagus, and shallots added and reheated. A simply baked potato would have been a better choice for this one. The attempt at an added flair didn't add much to this dish.

Under recommendation from our waitress, we also tried the Penne Jambalaya. This huge helping of pasta came with big chunks of chorizo, chicken breast and shrimp, in a Sambucca Cajun cream sauce. The sauce tasted a lot like vodka sauce, for those who have never tried Sambucca before. The portion size was impressive, and the pasta had a good kick of spice to it too. Definitely a win, and at $19 it was well worth it.

Once 10pm hit, the music was turned up to a deafening level, and other tables of guests began to arrive, including a few party groups with bottle service for the night. We decided it was time to ask for dessert so we could head on our way. The Brownie Cookie Stack arrived at our table with fanfare. A huge firework candle drew the attention from the tables around us as it arrived. It would be great for a birthday party or function, but as a regular dessert accompaniment it was a little over the top. Again, we were pleasantly surprised by the portion size, a stack of 4 huge, thick brownie and chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream and raspberry drizzle, all for $10. Although the presentation was amazing, the ice cream and sauce just couldn't bring out enough from the cookies, which were warm but weren't very moist or chewy.

Overall, the food is comparable to a lot of nightclub-restaurants on King Street in Toronto but at a more affordable price range, and without the 60-minute wait for a table. The service was great, from the manager to the hostesses we felt very welcomed at the restaurant. &Company would be an awesome spot to celebrate your birthday, family function or company party but if you are looking for an intimate dinner party or a romantic evening, this might not be the best choice."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, they made is pay $600 for bottle service despite the fact we had a guest list. Terrible service, it was empty on the inside and they made us wait for 30 mins outside for no reason. Never going back there again, nor letting anyone I know go there. Ripoff... Bad service... Terrible terrible experience."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place. I went with my girlfriends on a Saturday night around 9 and the place was dead. Like no one there. The main floor just had the hostesses, same with the patio. The music was all over the place...country then hip hop then rock etc etc it was just kinda weird. 

I'm not sure if they changed their menus or if menus are different between weekdays and weekends but a lot of it wasn't on the menu (I got the Goat Cheese Bake during my first visit but it wasn't on the menu) and for the price that was paid for each dish, we really didn't get that much food. I got the perogies and although they were scrumptious, it wasn't enough to fill an appetite. The flatbeard is fine and fills you up. The fried shrimp and calamari is basically half an appetizer, even with the side of asparagus. And the Mediterranean chicken kebob is three baby skewers of dry chicken. I can understand if this is one of those places where you pay a bit more for higher quality but we barely got that. 

We were told by our waitress that there was a burlesque show later on in the night so we finished our food and went downstairs to watch. When nothing happened for about 25 mins we ended up leaving and going to a fest at celebration square. On the patio the waitresses were nice enough to provide our table with a heater and warm blankets. 

I really hope &co steps it up a bit, I really enjoyed my first time there and I would like to again in the future."}
{"text":"Came in Friday night. Went for drinks and stayed for the dancing. Our server was busy but he was able to take pretty good care of us. (He also became the bartender later that night). The Caesar's were SO GOOD. Honestly those are the only reasons I give this place any stars at all. The DJ was HORRENDOUS. Awkward music changes, terrible song selections and ya, I love me some Chris Brown but WTF dude, do you get paid extra for every song you play of his?? Its like 80% of the songs were Chris Brown. But the worst, worst of it all... Was the crowd. A crazy combination of obnoxious and STINKY! They're all up in your space, pushing you as they're wildly dancing with their arms up, just fully immersing you in their B.O. Never again."}
{"text":"& Company Resto Bar seemed to be one of the few places in suburban Mississauga to offer something more of a classy urban chic higher end city parlour or lounge club experience. Unfortunately, on Saturday December 8th, 2012 it failed and paled in comparison to its TO downtown counterparts. 

The sophisticated modern decor (which I acknowledge as tasteful), exotic chef-speak titles for culinary delights on the menu with equally hefty price tags attached to these meals seemed to reflect an ideology of glamour and a promise of an extraordinary dining experience. At least this was the initial impression my 2 girlfriends and I were under when we came to this highly recommended new so-called \"hot-spot\" on a girls night out at around 9 PM. 

We were going to share a few appetizers and some drinks before getting our groove on on the dance floor to what we hoped would be great music. 

Those extremely inflated price tags for appetizer meals such as $15 poutine (aka \"duck confit poutine\") was just a simple poutine that tasted like the famous Smoke's pulled pork poutine which is 1/2 the price and double the portion. A platter of ravioli at the price of $16 is just ridiculous! There is no way 3 pieces of cheese stuffed pasta can justify that price! It was not a meal or even a plate! It was just plain old hearty pasta with a cheese filling. Absolutely nothing special that you could not get at any other restaurant. To sum it up, the prices did not reflect the culinary quality and value.

We were slightly disappointed and felt a bit ripped off, but what bothered us most was that we were approached by various people (some of whom were servers) every 3-5 minutes throughout our evening. While I appreciate good and attentive service, I believe that one server who built rapport with the clientele is more than suitable than 4-5 people running around disorganized without a clue about the the clients' orders or dining progress. If the young woman who originally served us was the only server attending to us, the experienced would have been more pleasant as she was keeping a good eye on us. However, we ended up being approached 5 times in a matter of 10-15 minutes asking us to refill our drinks (even though it was clear we still had full glasses and a large pitcher of sangria) as well as food on our table. This is just negligent and inattentive customer service. We were constantly interrupted, which broke the flow of our conversation and made the entire experience more tense and quite frankly annoying. Basically it felt like they were not concerned with customer satisfaction, but more about how many more drinks and appetizers they could up-sell in the shortest amount of time. It felt like a conveyor belt/fast-food/in-and-out kind of service. No etiquette, no quality, no professionalism. It was thoroughly disappointing. 

Finally the music came on around 10:30 PM. We figured the night will improve as we were not yet ready to give up on our fun. We were absolutely wrong! I understand that music is a thing of taste and that DJs cannot cater to everyone's satisfaction all the times - BUT.... a good variety of music is more likely to please the majority than a very specific targeted minority.  After all, this is meant to be a classy club with a diverse clientele (at least that is what their ad and marketing campaigns are all about!). The entire night, and I am not exaggerating when I say ENTIRE NIGHT (we stayed until 1:30 AM to give it a fair chance) the DJ selected to play trashy, derogatory, offensive, misogynistic, tasteless rap/hip hop music. Not even a slight mix of other genres. It was atrocious. People were not even hyped, you could see that the energy on  the dance floor was severely lacking. Perhaps if the DJ was not such a self-conceited Narcissist, he would see the same scene. He was in his own bubble playing the music as if he were in his own apartment cranking up his favourite tunes for him, himself, and him. 

Before I left that night I wrote the DJ a note saying \"If people don't seem to be dancing and responding to the music, maybe you should change it :) \".

Perhaps & Co. has room for improvement and perhaps there are better DJs on other evenings. However, our experience was a negative one. We rated it 2.5 out of 10."}
{"text":"Terrible place. Overpriced food, really really slow service. Can't use debit or credit at the bar (???) for purchases under $50 but conveniently they have an ATM inside that charges you an arm and a leg to withdraw money. 

Once they start playing music, it's really loud, particularly the high frequencies because the ceilings are relatively low. It's not club-loud, it's hearing-damage loud.

Avoid at all costs if possible. Nothing good about this place except possibly the location if you live in Mississauga or elsewhere in the west end."}
{"text":"I used to love this bar. Have gone to it on numerous occasions and know the bartenders and the photography guy.  But tonight was a different story. Me and my sister went a little late, 12:30, for a friends birthday who had a booth and bottle service. When we got there sober, did I mention SOBER, we walked up to the ticket girl saying we were with a booth and she told us 10 dollars cover.  We didn't ant to pay, so we called my friend.  While I was on the phone I was told to move to the side. Move to the side? NO ONE IS BEHIND US! IT'S DEAD! My sister pointed this out to one of the cocky bouncers and thinking he couldnt hear us he directed us outside. He then proceeded to THROW US OUT OF THE CLUB? why? We were willing to spend good money at the bar. And even willing to spend the money to get in to be there for my friends birthday. Even the bouncers outside were like wtf? Serious pricks work here. And I'm not saying this coming from a strong hatred. I used to like this club. Get new workers."}
{"text":"nothing special and not the best even .
went there last night and was not very happy 
the server had a attitude problem was unorganized had no idea who ordered what and did not bring our drinks to our tables we had to go up to the bar and order our drinks.
we ordered food and we never got it then when the bill came, we were charged for it. prices are way out of this world. a simple pizza that was the size of the small pizza was 14 bucks. a small steak that was the size of a hamburger paddy was 23 bucks so i was not a fan of there pricing. it was a mess from the start as soon as we got in the door no one wanted to bring us to our table, they have crazy pricing for a lot of stuff. a pitcher of \"\"filtered\"\" flat water was a buck per person per table, in my opinion its tap water. if you made reservations with a nice sized party 8+ and some of ur guests where late or didn't show up you would be charged 25 bucks for there no show per person that did not show up. the food was nothing to be pricy about it was not fancy too.i then spoke to the manager about his staff on the second floor he was very kind and understanding on the situation that happened that night removed the food that was not served and want to change the mood of the night by offering the table 1 free drink to the table per person we said no and then left very disappointed. the server charged 2 people at the table the same drink twice and tried to get both of us to pay for the same drink luckily we got her mistake. as far as the tip goes they have very very small print on the bottom of the menu that says that they will charge you 18% tip on everything you order. to make this even a better night we where upstairs the
\"\"dinning area\"\" we where then asked by the same manager to leave that room and to go down stairs as they wanted to remove the tables and set it up as a dance floor.
very disappointed worked in the food service industry for many years worked at high class restaurants, bars and high class banquet halls in the kitchen and out on the floor serving. will not go back ever again and i hope you do not go there too"}
{"text":"&Company - doesn't the name sound incomplete? Well, whoever thought of the name was similarly half attentive to the anonymous black lacquered slate façade that suggests this long-struggling locale is still under reconstruction.  There aren't very many decent eateries in Mississauga and &Co. has the potential to fill a gastronomic void in a pleasant price range. My wife and I had only a chicken breast sandwich and a turkey club for dinner & each was remarkably good. I say, remarkably, because the food was not a reflection of the  interior ambiance, which surpassed the exterior for its misdirection. There was construction drilling and hostesses popping balloons in preparation for nocturnal club activities while we sat eating nearby; it was 7:00 pm on a Friday evening.  Such bad etiquette alone suggests managerial inattentiveness.

It may well be that &Co is a thriving \"Resto Bar\" but my bet is that the restaurant side of the operation is a secondary concern.  Why else would normal dinner hour for adults feature pulsating club music on the sound system, conflicting tv screens incongruously airing fly fishing and boxing, and a black and red S&M display (supposedly this jived with the club theme for the night - To Russia With Love )?  

Finally, there's a late 90' Robert Palmer video called Simply Irresistible that was enhanced by the presence of slinky young women dressed in black. The art director who has paid so little attention to creating a compelling coherent décor at &Co. evidently put in a lot of time selecting the serving corps.  The beauties in black do their best to redeem the chaotic sights and sounds that interfere with what could be a fine place to dine with friends and family in a suburban restaurant wasteland.

Our recommendation: (1) Give the cook(s) a raise. (2) Re-do the street side façade (again!) so the place seems appealing at street level.  (3) Hire an interior decorator who'll miraculously devise a single theme that lends itself to both a full fledged restaurant (which &Co. could be) and a bar..  The construction antics at dinner time, though, suggest that an alternating theme concept is too energy intensive.  Then again, if the ownership is  set on reliving disco dreams, give up on the restaurant and sink or swim with Saturday night fevers."}
{"text":"Extremely pretentious and elitist (this is a club in MISSISSAUGA... RELAX!) .  Bouncers were very rude and very unfriendly for no reason.  The clientele of the club were very snobby. Would not go back, ever. &co seemed  like it wanted to be an upscale club on King St in Toronto, but it would never meet those standards. The clientele needs to learn how to respect other people and be decent human beings."}
{"text":"I'd heard rumblings (both good and bad) about this place and figured I'd check it out the next I was in Mississauga. Maybe I got lucky, but I was impressed by the food and the service.

I got there around 9:30 pm, so by the time I finished eating the place was starting to pick up a bit as it made the switch to a club. This didn't really have an effect on my enjoyment of the meal, but if you're the type to enjoy a quiet dinner with hushed conversation, I'd suggest you arrive earlier.

As for the food itself, I highly recommend the jambalaya; super tasty and worth the money. The server told me the dishes there are meant to be shared, but I very nearly polished it off all by myself.

In my opinion, &Company is a really good option if you're not in the mood to deal with the trip to downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in service. I'm from Mississauga and was looking for a consistent local go-to spot for a night out with all my friends and got kicked out for being \"too drunk\" when I hadn't been noisy or obnoxious or bothering anyone. They left me in the freezing cold when all my friends were inside and were my ride home and did not let me back in not even to wait in the warm in regardless of the fact that I drank all the water I was forced down and sat quietly for about half an hour. I didn't put up a fight at all and was respectful and calm but they still treated me as if I was a wild animal. They finally let me back inside when I used the washroom and then accused me of drinking more alcohol when I had held my friends drink so she could dance which she even told the bouncers, but regardless i was kicked out again and forced to leave my friends and go home. I work in the nightlife business myself and know that this behaviour is unprofessional and unacceptable. I really want to love this club because it is so close to my house and such a convenient place for me and my friends to celebrate, especially in the summer or when we need a place close by, but unfortunately by the way I was treated me and my friends will never come back here. I only wish that I could have an explanation and an apology because I feel so disrespected and unwelcome."}
{"text":"I went to &Co. on a Saturday in November for my birthday - we had an 8:00pm dinner reservation so that we could stay for dancing afterwards. 

A few days before my reservation I had visited the place to scope it out since I had never been, and the hostess was nice enough to give me the grand tour of the entire place. Dealing with the staff when making the reservation (also when confirming and making changes to the reservation) was a pleasant experience. Everyone I spoke with was very accommodating and helpful. 

The place itself is pretty nice, the decor is chic and modern as you would expect. When we showed up for our reservation we were given a large, high-top table in the centre of the dance floor which was pretty cool. It was a great vantage point to scope out the rest of the crowd, and it was the only table on the ground floor that is bolted down (which means they didn't take this table away when the dj/dancing started so we had it for the entire evening!). My only 2 complaints about the place itself is (i) there were no bathrooms on the ground floor (had to hike up a flight of stairs), and (ii) the outdoor patio wasn't heated. But these are minor in the grand scheme of things. 

We were a party of four and we opted to share a few plates including the duck confit poutine, crack chicken, buffalo mozzarella ravioli and the duo of dips. All of them were REALLY good. We all thought the food was absolutely delicious. The portions weren't skimpy, though they weren't especially generous either considering the price. 

Around 10:30 / 11:00-ish the place started to really fill up and the party picked up. The music was good (top 40, dance and hip hop) and we danced till the wee hours. The crowd was mixed, mostly mid-to-late 20's but I saw some 30- and 40-somethings there too. Overall I had a great time and would recommend &Co. to anyone looking for a chic and fun dining experience in Mississauga.

PS Mississauga was desperately in need of a place like this. It's nice to have this option outside of Toronto!"}
{"text":"Whenever in Toronto I make a point to stop by &Co. 
All the staff is always going above and beyond in order to accommodate my insane meal requests. Nightlife is as good as it gets in the 905 and 416. Djs always read the crowd well!
Love their menu and the fact that they aren't one more place with the same menu. (Moxies and Earls etc.)
They also change the menu seasonally and have done a ton of improvements and changes to the interior since opening. 

CAN'T WAIT TO VISIT AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out this spot the Sunday of the NBA All Star Weekend in Toronto since going out in Toronto was near to impossible. Definitely wasn't disappointed that a place like this can be found in Sauga. The night we went was Valentine's Day as well so we didn't expect the club to be packed but it was filled up in general. The bottle pricing here is similar to clubs in Toronto ($200 to $300 per bottle). The crowd seems to be more of a mature clientele hence, the have a certain dress code to avoid trashy people come on. The service was amazing at the managers, bartenders and waitresses were really helpful. Their late night menus features these mozzarella cheese sticks which are one of the best things I've ever tried. I'd go back just to eat that. Overall, definitely a surprise to find a classy place like this in Mississauga and I was definitely impressed."}
{"text":"Crap service. Took 2 hours for our party to get food!"}
{"text":"I'll let you in on a little secret.

The entire reason I got into restaurant reviewing in the first place is because I was immensely disappointed with this specific business.

I came here years ago for a friend's dinner party, and was offput by the lazy service, overpriced menu items and half-hearted attention to any sort of protocol. Mind you, this wasn't long after the place first opened, and I'm unsure if I actually posted my review to Yelp or deleted it in a huff after realizing it came off as a rant, but the point stands. I owe my reviewing \"career\" on Yelp to &Company Resto Bar.

Not much has changed.

The waitresses still walk around with \"deer-in-the-headlight\" looks in their eyes. The manager (I think it was a manager) roughly pushed through a crowd of people sitting in rows when he could have just walked down the nearby aisle. The drinks and menu items are still immensely overpriced. Yet, my experience was slightly better by virtue of everything else not being so bad.

I came here for a media launch promoting Mississauga Fashion Week, and finally had a chance to visit the upper level. The patio is nice, although you can't see much of anything due to the fence being so high, and the staff are a bit aloof. That said, it is undeniably a nice event space for private parties.

I would need to see this space on an average \"club\" night before I can make a true recommendation. That said, my second visit to &Company was marginally better than the first time. As long as the staff can bump up their professionalism a bit and they can stop trying to make themselves out to be \"Toronto-lite\", they'll do fine."}
{"text":"This place became a freaking joke... Went there last night with my boyfriend and sister to celebrate my birthday... We came around 12am... I thought there would be a line up to get in, but nope. No line ups. Only 5-10 people having smokes... Then we get in and pay $30, but I realize ground floor isn't even open and lights are on - weird, but okay... 
We come upstairs, it's half empty... The people that were there were underaged... We felt like we came to a grade 9 birthday party, it was actually pretty disturbing... The photographer was so bored walking around because he had no people to take pictures of... He ended up coming up to 3 young girls wanting to photograph them, but the girls told him \"oh no sorry our parents can't know where we are\"...  that was a red flag to us... I understand that people nowadays get fake ID's but common... How stupid are your bouncers that they don't realize when a girl is 14-15 years old?! 
Another issue were the drinks... They were so watered down, it was disgusting. No further comment on that... 
One more issue - where the hell did you guys hire your DJ?! I think a child would be better than what he was... 
We were able to notice all these issues in 15 mins. And then we left. Embarrassing for a club that praises itself for being the best and so on... And I see that I'm not the only one with the same opinion... You guys better fix it up or you will be putting locks on your doors!"}
{"text":"Went for New Years party and was sold out (actually bored so I'm yelping). Very Mixed young crowd/clientele. Everyone was great and friendly. The DJs / music was horrible and DJ couldn't mix music to save his life - beats were off between songs mixing and all over the place with styles not consistent (very very Latin oriented mixed music with some hip hop/r&b/reggae). Music  deteriorated after 12:00. Many left around 1:00 so it wasn't as crowded on the dance floor and Became more couples. The setup to get to the second floor is just one skinny stairwell so it really hard to get up and down, especially to the bathroom. There was no heated patio. They really should have hired a couple extra bar tenders as service was not impressive (though there were a couple that you saw that busted their asses serving). Did not have the meal or bottle service. Not much seating. I would not go to this club again (Especially Not for New Years anyway!)."}
{"text":"Like everything else people are more likely to say something when it's negative. I read some of the reviews and experienced the opposite when I visited for the first time this past Saturday night,  it was busy, the crowd was good, music was nicely diversified. The staff were patient and provided top notch service. I like how the washrooms are completely private with no shared stalls. We had bottle service and our server Marta was fantasic. Yes downtown t.o provides you more options but it's a hassle and more expensive. If you're looking to stay local and want to go somewhere more energetic and with a dance floor I would highly reccomend this place.
Cheers"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the food. Came here for a bday dinner. In terms of the space, it seems like a good spot for large group dinners. Lots of long tables. However, the food was a huge disappointment.

We each had the prix fixe dinner menu which came with a salad, soup, entree and dessert. The salad and soup weren't bad, and I thought the meal was off to a good start. Then came the entrees - I ordered the gnocchi which was mushy. The sauce it was in didn't taste good either. Possibly one of the worst gnocchis I've ever had. Another ordered the chicken and said it was dry. For all the steak orders, the steaks were over-cooked. Medium rares became medium wells. Two of the orders were wrong, and by the time those two got the dishes they ordered, everyone else was done their entrees. The steaks themselves were so tough that our jaws hurt from chewing them. Dessert was ok but I found it to be overly sweet. 

While the food was well presented, the taste was just not there."}
{"text":"I went to this place once for a friends birthday! Food was terrible. Service was worse. Lets just say this is one place I will never go again."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and people skills. Went on a Wednesday and we couldn't get in for at least 2 hours we left at 10pm. The bouncers they hire have no ability to determine how many people get in per capacity. All four of us girls ended up leaving. Good luck &co."}
{"text":"On a Saturday evening during La Poutine Week, my friends and I made the trek to &Company Resto Bar in Mississauga, seeing how we live on the north and east side of Toronto (Markham/Scarborough), it is a trek. We had already spent earlier in the week going to most of the other participating restaurants that were more central to Toronto. &Company Resto Bar was offering for La Poutine Week, a gnocchi poutine with braised beef cheeks and crispy garlic and it was by far the most unique poutine of the week and we made a last minute decision to go as it's not opened on Sunday.

We arrived around 9:30pm and parked across the street. In front of the doors were security guards who checked our IDs. It's a \"resto bar\", after 9pm, ok, sure. Then we were greeted by a hostess who asked us if we had a reservation, which we didn't, and she said there's a $20 per person cover to go in. We just wanted to try their poutine. The hostess had no idea what I was talking about and insisted we pay the cover in order to go in. At this point another staff member came to ask what the issue was, he then went to inform the manager.

The manager comes to speak to us, but informed us that there aren't any table, they could however set us up at the bar. We were okay with that and were escorted to the bar. We decided to just order right away as they set us up. 10 minutes later the bar staff comes back to ask if we'd like to have that there or to go, seeing how nothing has been set up for us to stay, we decided to have it to go. Five minutes later the manager comes to us at the bar telling us he'll set us up to sit at the bar, to which we told him we had ordered it to go anyway. Another five minutes goes by and the bar staff returns with a bag with our poutines. We ask for some plastic cutlery as we were planning on eating it in the car, he goes to look and returns with nothing, stating they've run out and if we really wanted some he'd go get them from the storage. At this point, we have had it and we desperately need to leave as our experience was getting worse and worse.

We drove to a nearby friend's home who brought us some plastic forks and had the poutine on their driveway. The poutine was fantastic, one of top three favourite poutines of the week, but there's just no way I'd go back. I can't help but laugh every time I see their restaurant name participating in something (like Mac & Cheese week), as if I'd go back there again!"}
{"text":"Went there again on Wednesday (Spanish night) they reach salsa. Line was packed, you could only get in if you know someone who spends money there, thankful I got in - although the bouncer have attitude as always.

Club played mostly Spanish music, major Spanish crowd, was very packed. Upstairs played hip hop and rap was packed as well, crowd was pushy, lots of stepping on while people salsa. People who come on Wednesdays seem to know everyone as it's mainly the same crowd. I'm sorry &co your club doesn't hit it"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest clubbing person, so don't expect a 'raving' review. heheheh

Came here for the Halloween party; I've always heard mediocre things about this place, so my standards weren't that high when I went in. When I read this place was a restaurant by day, and club by night, I was slightly skeptical. I wasn't completely suprised to find tables pushed to the side to make more space to dance. Even then however, there wasn't that much room.  The main dancefloor was completely crowded , and there was a lot more potential room hadn't there been tables in the way. 


That's really all I can say about it.  The music was okay, bar was fine, everything was run-of-the-mill

The Ticket price was way too high for what we got, however. I most likely wouldn't do it again."}
{"text":"Dinning Experience: Dinner
Specialty: Canadian/International
Menu items: Goat Cheese Bake, Lobster Tacos, Grilled Lamb Chops, Cajun Blackened Scallops & White Sangria

& Company Resto Bar is more than a restaurant. It's fine dining establishment by day and burlesque show, turn lounge, turn club, by night. By day, Executive Chef Rob Lussier offers a contemporary twist on classic dishes with a delectable assortment of seasonal cuisine. By night, &Company transitions into an exhilarating nightlife experience facilitated by world-class DJ's, exclusive events and premium cocktails from the city's top mixologists.

Drinks and appies are certainly the specialty at this unique Mississauga venue. My drink for the night consisted of a subtle White Sangria made with white wine, triple sec and fresh seasonal fruit. Light on the palate at first, with a light sweetness and a strong kick upon emptying the glass.

With it, and as recommended by our waitress, we ordered the Goat Cheese Bake. The appie comes with a sour cherry compote, candied walnuts and pecans accompanied by crostini. What I liked about this cheese dish is how the Chef let the goat cheese shine on its own, while plating the dish in a playful way that lets guests pick and choose their pairings and flavours.

Next on the chopping board, quite literally since most dishes come served in one; were the Lobster Tacos. A delicious ensemble of garlic buttered lobster tails with pico de gallo, tomatillo salsa, shredded lettuce and cheddar cheese, served with sour cream and guacamole. Though I would have like the guac to be chunkier and tacos to come served on a soft shell, the key flavours of this dish hit the spot with us, especially as we found ourselves smiling with joy at the sight of large pieces of lobster that were fresh and buttery. Once again, letting the main ingredient of the dish shine as much as possible.

On the red meat front, & Company Resto Bar serves killer dijon-grilled lamb chops cooked to one's liking, served with a hearty lamb-bacon ragout with frizzled shallots and a mint jus. Probably our favourite dish of the day. The lamb was tender and medium-rare, just the way it should be and the frizzled shallots where the best accompaniment with it giving the dish extra texture. Though the lamb was  served covered in the shallots, the meat was so well cooked and flavoured, that we didn't mind digging through them to get the lamb. We were like kids opening a Christmas present.

Our last appie for the night consisted of Cajun Blackened Scallops served on a bed of corn, pineapple and basil salsa. The salsa paired nicely with the scallop, accenting the sweetness of the corn while balancing the strong taste from the spice. Though we felt the scallops could have used less of the cajun mix, we still loved this dish and whipped the board clean.


Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Wow, what a weird place. $20 cover after 10pm on a Saturday in Mississauga is a rip off. For $20 I prefer to go downtown. That is the first problem. Secondly, you need to pay for parking around the corner, so add an extra $5. The bathrooms are located up some very long stairs, and they are not really a bathroom, more like permanent port-o-potties. They are unisex and there is no urinal for guys. I would hate to see the line up down the stairs to use these port-o-potties. Nobody was dancing by 11pm on a Saturday, and they had the nerve to have a line up outside to pretend they are a hip and busy club. I will not go back because this club tries to be awesome, but it does not provide enough services to clients at a good value. And even though I liked the Charlie Chapman impersonator, he was very friendly, I just felt it did not go well with a Clubbing vibe."}
{"text":"Went there for their dinner and a party Saturday nights. It was OK. Firstly we had to pay for parking. It was far. Then the food took long to arrive. On a positive note they gave us one of the meals on the house because it took a while to arrive. The food was OK - not spectacular, but priced reasonably for what you get. Then after dinner time the nightlife started up. That was kind of exciting."}
{"text":"My first time going last night. Had a blast. Staff are attentive, but washrooms should be kept up to date a lot..because girls washroom ran out of toilet paper quickly and girls waited a while to get another one. But good night and great drinks!"}
{"text":"Given its location (right beside Square One), it's a very convenient restaurant, turned bar (at 10:30-11pm). 

Pros:
- Penne Jambalaya. Absolutely delicious
- Complimentary coat check until 10pm 
- My server was very nice; checked on us quite frequently.
 - My white sangria was delicious (thank you Cantino Loco; this is my new fave!) 
- They have two floors (which have different DJ's and hence, different music)
- They have their own personal photographer which circles &co after it's turned into a club (and the photos are uploaded onto their Facebook shortly after)
- Tons of washrooms; there are two located on the second floor (awesome!) but there's only one single stall downstairs (...how convenient)

Cons:
- The 15% tip was hidden in the bill. Given the dark, romantic ambiance of the restaurant, I missed it on my bill. Darn it! 
- The drinks are a bit pricey. I think a beer and a cosmopolitan came up to ...$16? 
- The bars don't accept debit or credit. Instead, you're forced to use their ATM and pay ATM fees (thank you, I love paying for my own money).
- You have to pay for parking 

Overall, I've been to &co twice (not by choice, my friends chose the location). I think it is a little overrated; the restaurant/bar isn't bad, but it's not amazing. Given its location though (Mississauga doesn't have a lot of bars/clubs), I guess it's okay. I'd really rather party in Toronto to be honest."}
{"text":"Came here for a dear friend's birthday, she picked this place because she's been here and swore it is a great place. 

As soon as you walk in you notice the nice decor and nice vibe. So then it came time to Order our food. I ordered the chicken Parmesan and my guest ordered the penne jumbalaya. The chicken parm wasn't so shabby, the portion was huge. The taste however didn't win me over so much. I tried the jumbalaya, that was a bit better. Small portion although but at least it was tasty. I ordered a margarita, although it didn't taste good. It felt like it was missing something. Since it was missing something, It had a horrible taste to it. 

The part where I was shocked? There were fruit flies flying over throughout the whole time. Right over our food. We all saw it, I wasn't the only one. Iv never seen that before in a restaurant. Never ever. That's why overall I'm giving it 2 stars for the food and cool loungey vibe you get when you're inside. everything else was a 1 star rating, especially the Fruit fly experience."}
{"text":"This was a dinner visit.  Great service.  Quality of food is top notch.  I made a dinner out of apps...I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"&Company is seemingly exactly what the name says. It is a bar, & it is a restaurant, & it is a nightclub. I read in the reviews that there is also a patio but we did not see it as it was freezing outside. 

It is fancy and very dolled up. Kind of reminded me of Brandt house just with a different layout. 

We came here for my cousin's birthday and to me it was a throwback to when I actually enjoyed going out late every weekend. 

If you get there before 10 I believe you can eat dinner and not pay a cover. At some point the kitchen closes and then a cover charge is implemented. 

We got there at around 8:45 on a Friday and the place was pretty desolate. After saying hello to the rest of our party we sat in some of the high tables and chairs as you walk in. Service was not that great until we sat down (I think they only track by seat so the waitresses are reluctant to take your order until you sit. 

We ordered a appetizers as meals I had the pulled pork tacos and my wife had a tomato bisque. To our surprise. Both were pretty good. Very well put together for the tacos and the bisque plate was cleaned. Although I heard the other table sent their meals back a couple of times. Also the whole menu seems quite pricey. Ours were fairly expensive I think 18 and 14 for each. Maybe the cover is built into the food prices?  

By 11pm the place was filling up and there was a lineup at the door. The already loud music got louder and the place for some reason was mostly dudes. 

For some reason the bathrooms are up a two storey staircase other than one accessible bathroom by the door. And please note that I suppose for groups they do put the 18% tip in automatically on your bill.

The service is about 3 stars as well.  It almost seemed like most of the servers/bussers really did not want to be there.  

We did not stick around long after that but the place is decent.  I would not hate coming back but would also not seek out a reservation."}
{"text":"I went on a friday night to have some drinks and hang out with friends. It wasn't that busy and the DJ had awkward song transitions. He would play a good song for about 10 seconds before quickly switching to another so that was kind of a buzzkill. And the way the bathrooms are designed, I bet it's not fun when this place is too busy. But overall, I don't have much to complain about, I had a good time."}
{"text":"The presentation of the food is very nice, and a few of the items are well worth the price such as the \"crack chicken\". Although I feel like the pricier the dishes get, the less they feel worth it. Get really busy on a wednesday night before it turns into a salsa club."}
{"text":"The environment was amazing, our waitress Michelle was great and super helpful since we aren't from the area. A little pricey but it the chicken parm was to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I'm currently at &co for a friend birthday. I was a bit skeptical because I've been hearing mixes reviews about the food but I  wanted to try It for myself. I ordered the Szechwan Lamb Spare Ribs and my friend ordered the crack chicken. My food was gross. The lamb was gamey but the actually sauce wasn't bad I thought I could get past it until I tried the sides. The warm potato salad tasted like it had a Dijon dressing or mustard seeds I didn't like it or the contrast between flavours. Then the slaw was a mix of raw onion and carrots. Just gross. They also serves some type of onion bloom made with red onions but it was room temperature. Not impressed. I knew I would even finish half my meal so I asked my waiter used its possible for me to get something els and she said yes happily. Her name was Christina and she have amazing customer service. She brought me a crack chicken which is basically adult chicken and fingers served with a tobasco based sauce. It was really good and well seasoned. I think and co needs to work in the descriptions of their food on the menu it's too vague. Had I'd better known what was going to be served to me I probably wouldn't have ordered it. But it terms of customer service it was great. Ask for Christina!"}
{"text":"Was here yesterday for the Latin Night.  Great place in the suburbs where you can find good food and nightlife.  Came with some friends to eat and lounge.  Had the Serious Pena great cocktail then coronas all night as they were on special!  Had the salmon which was made with a Thai twist and rice noodles.  It was phenomenal.  After dinner just stayed to lounge but ended up learning some salsa on the dance floor as they have an instructor that comes in to teach.  Ended up making a whole night of it and did bottle service on their patio which I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is THE best restaurant in Mississauga hands down if you have an adventurous palette and consider yourself a bit of a foodie. 

Today was my third time visiting, and I can confidently say they've not disappointed yet which is why I chose to write this. 

For starters we had the steak tartare and the Santorini salad (watermelon salad). The salad was very well balanced, usually chefs will kill a watermelon salad with too much feta but this was perfect. Steak tartare is one of my favorite dishes; if a restaurant is bold enough to offer it they usually pride themselves on their culinary skills. They didn't disappoint, the capers mixed with the beef phenomenally. I even placed it in my top 3 tartare ever. 

For my main I had the Carbonara with pappardelle. The egg yolk was perfectly prepared and once popped created a fantastic, well rounded and balanced dish. 

We finished off the meal with some fresh seasonal sorbet also prepared in house. Very fresh, energizing and light way to finish the meal. 

Let me finish this review by saying this is purely based on the food and service before 10pm, once this place turns into a \"club\" I avoid the area completely. In fact, I think they would be better suited to be a full time restaurant because the chef and kitchen staff are phenomenal. 

Eat here with confidence! If you're looking to party, go downtown."}
{"text":"I love coming here for dinner especially before the nightlife transition. The steak is amazing. Don't forget to try the crack chicken on the late menu!"}
{"text":"Came here for a regular outing, we were a group of 8 people, called for a reservation ahead of time, so we had a table ready for us upon arrival, nicely centred in the middle of the restaurant/lounge area.
Parking is very limited on the street, you most likely have to park at the Sussex Centre across.
The tables are high, with high stool chairs setup, so it gets a bit annoying after sitting for a long while, rather than regular chairs/booths.

Service is okay, a little on the slow side, but our server was nice and seemed like she had some good info on the menu.
The vibe is cool, the place is nice and trendy, however, it got very loud very quickly and the place turned into a club sometime throughout the night, with a dance floor full of people..
The \"restaurant\" area is located on an open concept next to the dj/dance floor area, which makes it impossible if you're there to 'dine' to actually do so and have a decent conversation, you're forced to either join the crowd and party or leave the place!!

After it got a little bit too much to handle, we went up the stairs to their rooftop patio, which was the highlight of this place. Really cool setup, chilled zen typa music, a bar and nice lounge chairs/booths.

Good place, I'd visit again probably sometime in the summer, however, it needs some work on layout and service level."}
{"text":"Well this place certainly monopolizes as it's the only 'good' thing to go to within the 'downtown' Mississauga core. (ahem, if you're looking to do be an entrepreneur, think lounge/club in Mississauga).

Luckily they have been the only successfully thing at the corner of Essex for a long time...so they are obviously doing something right.

I've been to &CO plenty of times before but I've never had a burning desire to be a repeat offender. I think those desires are good to have, that's how regulars keep coming back ;).

I've enjoyed their long weekend bashes that they host on Sundays. I've attended many of those and the music, crowd and vibe are always exceptional. 

Wednesdays are great due to their Latin nights but they accumulate one hell of a crowd. It could be that also anytime I go on a Wednesday a long weekend is approaching, so perhaps that is why there are always so many people.

My issue with &CO is everything that happens outside (even before getting into the venue). Aside from that, nothing to worry about. Great music, spacious, a variety of areas to dance in and good drinks. The upstairs is the only crowded part but it's a small space with a lot of people who enjoy the same music- so it's expected.

First things first, I appreciate people who have passion for their jobs but the bouncer outside needs to take it down a couple of notches. No need to be insulting (not to me personally  but I heard how he was speaking to certain people in the line) in order to get your point across. Mama always said be nice. Plus if it wasn't for all these people in \"line\" that you keep telling to go home and dictate rules like we are 12, then, you sir would have no job. I remember he also mentioned \"next time get here earlier folks\"..to people who came in late. We were in line at 10:30, how early do you want people to come? Some people have 9-5s (or later) and would like to shower and be presentable for your establishment. This guy thinks we are going to be buying tents at Walmart to pitch outside of &CO - CHILL. 

The man at the front with a very nice haircut and tailored suit who initially \"opens the ropes to the heavens \"and perhaps will glance at your I.D, really needs to figure out some time managing skills. I understand you want to let bottle service in first (understandably these folks clearly have money to spend on weeknights). I also understand that Jane may know Joe that works at the bar and Larry knows the dishwasher, but for fuck sakes pay attention to the regular folks in line as well. We also have money to spend and an ass to shake. It's unfortunate that it's \"who you know\" type of industry. I know me...now let me in. Funny enough, I'm a blogger and going to be doing reviews on establishments soon, so never under estimate us \"regular\" folks in the lineup. We also have a voice within our communities as well.  

Anyways, back to the man with a nice haircut and tailored suit. I think letting the \"left\" line up in every 15-20 minutes in small groups ISN'T a bad idea. Not only does it become annoying being at the front and seeing all these \"cool folks\" get in a head of you, it's annoying that nobody is checking their I.Ds (when, they clearly look underage) or that nobody is turning them away. I don't understand how you want to keep an image/standard yet you are letting ADULT GROWN men in the club with their boxers showing (Lord, this isn't Club 108 Platinum Parties from the 2000s). Who cares who they know or if they took 2 minutes to fill out a guest list, send them home.

Finally, we are in and we obviously rush to the washroom to pee and we barely even got a dose of Latin night. Perhaps 30 minutes MAX but if you are going to keep your guests waiting outside, stretch the Latin portion of the night so we get a chance to participate in ALLL THE EXCITEMENT!!!!!!!!!


Overall, I don't have much of a problem with the music. Obviously you are there because you enjoy Latin music, top 40 or hip/hop dancehall. I wish there was more structure upstairs to get to the patio. It seems that you have to slither your way through and rub tits with everyone along the way only to get a breath of fresh air on the patio. At that point everyone is thinking you want to take them home with you and you've lost your wolf pack. 

The rooftop- is the best part of &CO in my opinion. Love the fact that they have seating, heaters and that it is spacious. Great view of the city, I quite enjoy it!

I will for sure give them another shot on a Wednesday because I'm all about second chances ;). This time I will arrive early and see what rampage our amigos are on that day.

I'll certainly provide an updated review and I am hoping one day to try the food, because, apparently they serve it there!"}
{"text":"Been there a couple times over the past few years.   I liked the large dance area, music including some different songs, and the layout and ambience."}
