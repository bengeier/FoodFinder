{"text":"Best wings I've had in North Toronto.  We got the wimps' versions - mild and spicy honey garlic.  Both were amazing though and had just enough kick for those with slight aversion to the super spice :) We will be back for the hot ones!"}
{"text":"Ive been going to duffs since i was a young gun. Its always delivered on amazing wings. Whether you are taking out for a wing feast at home or munching down with your buddies, it just cant be beat for atmosphere, wings and honey garlic sauce. So good"}
{"text":"As good as it gets.   Awesome traditional butter sauces at all level of heat (from zero heat up to \"Armageddon\"), good bbq, honey garlic, and hot honey too.  The real key here is not just great sauce, but large (not HUGE) wings, cooked nicely, crispy bite, but still juicy inside, and with no outside fat.   These are the best wings I've ever had. There's a reason that the place is full 7 nights a week.   Also, the brothers who own it, and all of the servers are extremely nice."}
{"text":"This was the first wings place I tried after I moved to Toronto, and since then they are the benchmark for every other wings restaurant. Their wings are the best. Meaty, large enough, and they always give you an extra one or two in the order, I guess just in case one was randomly too small.   Good service, good atmosphere, fast (although try to go during the weekdays to avoid the long wait time for a table) and decent prices. Good job guys."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since high school, and I won't stop anytime soon.  The wings are probably the best in the city.  I've never been to the College st. location but I'm sure it's the same."}
{"text":"though this place is famous for it's wings i wasn't too fond of it because my experience was of the chicken wings being over marinated with TOO MUCH sauce! their home-made sauce had such a sour taste to it. the BBQ flavour wings tasted like ketchup wings, the mild wings tasted really citrusy, the honey garlic wings were REALLY saucy and the armageddon..... DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU CAN NOT HANDLE THE HEAT. let's just say it was soooooo spicy that the smell of this could burn your nose! my cousin was only able to eat 2 wings and it literally burned his lips and gave him indigestion! other than that i found the salad to be delicious and refreshing. the celery sticks were superb! so fresh and crunchy! and the potato wedges with the dill pickle sauce was my ALL TIME FAVOURITE! mediocore experience but for the future i think i'm gonna stick to Louis Wings for my chicken wings."}
{"text":"Great wings and great service. Don't forget your side of Armageddon sauce! The menu could use a dry rub wing flavor."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm saying this but, I actually think the wings are a bit too big here.  when it comes to wings, I like to put the whole thing in my mouth.  when it comes out, it is usually just the bones.  about 1.5 - 2 inch in length will be my ideal length for a wing.  cooking wise, wings are cooked pretty good here and the sauces are good as well.  no problems  with how they are cooked.    I also ordered the chicken club wrap this time.  the circumference of the wrap was like the size of a softball.  this was big but, short lol.  meaning, the length of the wrap was pretty short.  4-5 bites into it, I was at the end/bottom of the wrap.  wrap was pretty good.  no complaints here as well.  all in all, not that bad here.  prices were average and portions of food was like any other bars.    will I come back... yes.  location is pretty convenient and food is good too.   p.s.  is there a shortage in carrots? wings always came with carrots and celery... these days, just celery.  is carrots really that expensive?"}
{"text":"Wings are good. Great flavor. Good value. Challenge, just like their Eglinton location is that the wings are inconsistent. Sometimes they overcook them."}
{"text":"Duffs I think by far the best chicken wings in the city of Toronto always fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying out Duff's Wings after reading a review on BlogTO... It was Saturday night and the place wasn't too crowded.  I ordered small fries ($3.25) and 2lbs wings ($19.95) which came with celery. Celery came in a clear cheap looking plastic bowl.  Wings - I tried Hot Honey Garlic and Hot BBQ but I couldn't really tell the difference between the two flavours. They were both spicy and sweet.....that's for sure.  Fries - !??@#K@@# why did I get this? .... I'm really going to start to appreciate St.Louis' fries. Their fries tasted like it came from a bag of frozen fries bought at a supermarket.  Oh, the service and atmosphere was decent."}
{"text":"Their wings are extremely average / the hitter the wing the more they taste like vinegar - not really worth it to go there"}
{"text":"I wanted to enjoy a night out with my daughter and I had heard about Duffs. I wish I had yelped it before I arrived. The feeling when I walked in was like a mess hall. When we were seated in the corner it made the feeling complete. Low class service was terrible at best. As for the food I ordered wings and fries with a small pitcher of beer. The fries were not bad and more than enough for two. The wings were not petite and ok but nothing special. I found the wait staff pushy to clear the table and wanting me to order desert or pay my bill.  Find another wing place trust me you are not missing anything here."}
{"text":"They are some of the better wings i've had so far in toronto.  The duffs saucy chicken fingers were good as well."}
{"text":"I'm a legit chicken wing connoisseur, and trust me when I say that Duff's are the best. First the wings themselves, they are meaty with minimal fat, reasonably sized (not too big and from Chernobyl or something) and always cooked perfectly. The art of deep frying is not as easy as you non chefs think, their wings consistently come out very juicy and of course with no breading!  Now the sauce, what can't be said about the best sauce, and the hottest, in Toronto: ARMAGEDDON! Insanely tasty but very hot, I use the blue cheese dip in between wings with the fries (also delicious) to cool down. They make the Armageddon and Death sauce in house, I've pleaded with them to share the recipe but only their father knows it apparently and won't tell the sons.  Cheap wing night gets a little crazy if you don't come early but otherwise the place is just flat out awesome. All the locations are family run, they always rectify any issue and the sauce is the boss! (sorry bad pun)..."}

{"text":"My preferred wing destination. Wings feel large and robust. Sauces are generally good but not the spiciest. Beer isn't particularly cheap. Wings are above average though for sure"}
{"text":"Duffs famous wings are famously not that great. They are expensive for what you get and the flavours are really poor compared to say St Louis or I wings on Queen. My girlfriend and I have been here several times, each time expecting better, but do not get the other Yelpers recommendations. Poor fries, poor wings, average service and an average setting/ ambiance. 2 out of 5. If u love great wings try elsewhere!"}
{"text":"There is nothing famous about this place. The wings had no taste and were cold. Will not return any time soon."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite place to be. The atmosphere is great. The wings are amazing! I have also had their burgers and salads, and they are equally as delicious! But let's be honest: you come for the wings.  The staff are always amazing. There is one girl we usually get with the tattoo on her left arm (I believe it is of a landscape with pine trees and a sunset or something like that), and she's always so nice. Attentive, but not too attentive. It's like she's keeping an eye out if you're drink is empty or if there is any empty dish before approaching. It's great!  The rest of the staff that we've interacted with have also been awesome. This place really does a great job at hiring the right people.  It does get really busy sometimes, but I can't complain. We've even done takeout orders, so it's great to be able to take some Duff's wings on the go.  Keep up the great work, guys!"}
{"text":"I usually order the wings \"easy on the sauce\" as I find the default amount of sauce too much. When they are served this way, they are perfect! Especially with the blue cheese dipping sauce.  I haven't had anything else on the menu but wings/beer, so I can't comment on any of the other menu items.  The patio is small, with only about 16 seats or so. If it's the summer, and you want to eat outside, be prepared to wait.  Service is good, food is good. No complaints."}
{"text":"Great wings and good prices, makes Duff's my favourite wing place in the city.  The wings are always hot, and nice and saucy, and the fries on the poutine are always crunchy, and smothered with just enough cheese and gravy so that they are not too dry, but not too soggy either.  I usually take out the food from here, and it is always ready within in 15 minutes of my call.  The hot wings are nice and vinegary, and the honey hot and delicious with a perfect hint of garlic in the sauce.  I would definitely recommend Duff's over the other wings places in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Yum yum wings are awesome! Great hot sauce. Great service. Music sucks and they need fried pickles on the menu."}
{"text":"Buddy of mine showed me this little gem years ago been hooked ever since. best buffalo wings in Toronto if not the GTA. Always fast and polite services. keep it up!"}
{"text":"The best wings in Toronto, no contest. I've been dozens of times and never been disappointed. Excellent spiciness gradients so that you can get what's right for you, plus some other flavours. I recommend the medium-hot. Good wedges too. If I want wings, this is the only place I think about going."}
{"text":"Probably the most overrated restaurant I've come across. For the wings to be famous I'd expect more, they were like a side order of wings at Kelsey's at best. They barely had any flavors and the ones that we did get were absolutely average. Not bad, just overwhelmingly average. However service was good and it was not more expensive than its competitors. Hot sauce was the dreaded Frank's Red Hot with a little bit of whatever else the chef puts in so he can still call himself a chef, but this is not unlike many other places. The Celery was actually really good, as I read in the reviews this was a plus for this place. Final call: avoid if you are a wing aficionado, go if you just want the average wing."}
{"text":"Decided to give Duff's a try since I've heard so many good things about them. The overall look of the restaurant is good. The wait staff is average. Not overly fantastic customer service, but by no means bad. Anyways, we ordered the calamari to start hoping that it would be fresh. Sadly, we were wrong. The calamari is frozen and chewy. You can tell by the taste that it's frozen. Mine was not even hot all the way through. Really disappointing. I opted for the Tuesday night wing special, 1lbs of wings for $7.75. A pretty good deal. I ordered Bold BBQ, my dinner date went for Medium. We were so excited to try them since everyone raves about them. The wings are mediocre at best. The sauces are good, with a lot of options (mild, medium, bbq, salt & pepper, etc). However, the wings themselves just don't cut it. You'd find wings just as good at Kelsey's Half Off Wing Night for cheaper. Overall, this restaurant isn't somewhere that you must go. There are better gems in the area. Especially when they're serving frozen calamari. Also, they charge for refills on fountain drinks. You can buy a pitcher of fountain pop, but once that's done you'd have to buy another. It's always a turn off when I go to a restaurant and they charge for fountain pop. Similarly like I mentioned above, I'd recommend passing this place if you're looking for good wings."}
{"text":"Had Duffs a month ago The chicken wings are over the top amazing, But they should work on making everything more  Clean.For example the bowls are wet and so is the plates and cups.  Also they should have better survice too. Don't exactly recommend it here."}
{"text":"Oh man, I love wings.  This place isn't my favourite in the city, but it's pretty good.  The restaurant doesn't take reservations, but I've never had a problem getting a seat, even as part of a large group.  Service is fast and friendly, even though the place is usually really busy.  The wings are tasty, and they have a good variety of flavours--I don't like my food too spicy, so the mild-medium was perfect for me (they warn that their medium is actually hot).  The sides and apps are not very impressive, though.  We had a large group, so we ordered fried pickles and zucchini to start, and the two were pretty much indistinguishable.  (We also ordered poutine, which was light on the gravy and not very flavourful.)  This place is good for groups, but if you've only got a few people, you can definitely find someplace tastier."}
{"text":"They have like 4 different hot levels and 5 different flavours. All-Stars has 100+...that's just god damn lazy!"}
{"text":"Great Service but the wings have started arriving dried out and skimpy. And I've been eating there for 5 years!"}
{"text":"I like wings every once in a while but the S.O. is the real aficionado. If I subject him to dainty lady food, that means I sometimes have to concede to his lust for greasy carnage. We heard about half-price Tuesdays at Duff's (thanks Yelp!) and decided to give it a try.  First, the wings aren't half price any more. They're 10 for $6.75 (reg. $9.75). No bigs, still a bargain. Everyone else seemed to think so as the line was out the door on a rainy Tuesday night.  I chose mild medium because the signs on the wall say that \"Medium is HOT.\" Mild medium wasn't hot at all and I was kind of wishing that I got medium. The S.O. got medium hot and when I tried one, it wasn't that much hotter but it was way tangier--in a Tabasco-ey kind of way. The wings were plump and made to order instead of pre-cooked and then sauced like I've seen at other places. (*cough, cough Gabby's*.)  What I really loved was the celery at Duff's. Now I know what you're thinking; Who the hell goes to a wings joint and reviews the celery? Well, I happen to like celery. A lot. The stalks were so fresh and crunchy at Duff's instead of dry and limp like I usually see them. I'm referring to the celery here. FOCUS!  I know blue cheese is the classic accompaniment but the creamy dill dip at Duff's tastes much better. Especially with that glorious celery. (All right, all right. I'll shut up about the celery now.)  Overall, OK but I probably wouldn't go back there on a Tuesday night because it's too crowded and noisy, and it's hard to get the server's attention. The Jay's game was on, so the place had a sports bar feel to it. And after eating only 8 out of my 10 wings, like Richard S. said, \"my digestive track is none to pleased with my behavior.\""}
{"text":"Wing night on Tuesdays. 'Nuff said.  The wings here are a good sized and perfectly cooked. Not dried out or undercooked like some other wing joints. The skin is really crispy too.  My favourite part is that they don't ding you for ordering multiple sauces unlike some other wing joints and your wings come in orders of 10 rather than pounds... Nice and simple.  The sides though are overpriced ($4.50 for fries?), but that's probably so that you focus more on the wings. There's usually a lineup here, but the service is quick, so the turnover is pretty fast too.  Personally I find their hot sauce a little on the salty side, but for this price and quality who cares?"}
{"text":"Great wings and excellent blue cheese dressing.  A bit on the pricey side, bit the sauce (very hot - go a step down from your norm) is excellent."}
{"text":"We were craving wings and found this place on bayview. Super friendly waitress and fairly busy Friday night. Such a comfortable place. We ordered medium and super hot wings, fried pickles and poutine. We ordered their wing specials.   Reseasonable priced. This place is so much better than any chain wing restaurant"}
{"text":"Best wings in the city. Hot honey wings are delicious and the med/hot wings are nicely flavoured I.e. Not just dipped in Tabasco. Also, the Guinness on tap is bar none the best in TO. I have no idea how they do it, but it is always creamy and smooth!"}
{"text":"So whenever I have a hankering for chicken wings in Richmond Hill I go here. It is a must to get them well done it takes it to a whole new level. I have tried different sauces from here. I've gone up to hot which is sometimes the same spice level as lower ones. That's the one downside of duffs the sauce spice level changes. One time your hot sauce may taste like mild but your mild may taste like medium hot."}
{"text":"Truly not worth your time or money.  One should always have low expectations for the food and service at pubs like this, but this way below my lowest expectations. This particular location has a poor atmosphere, it's cheap looking, open concept and loud and not a good-loud.   The prices are high, like a Baton Rouge, even more than All Stars but the food is average and the atmosphere is worse.  My wife asked for a minor substitution and was told \"no\" by the manager.  Just \"no\" and it was replacing jalapeño poppers with mozzarella sticks.  Even after the waitress told the manager the customer was upset, still nothing.   In summary: average wings, below average burger, fries, overpriced, poor service, bad atmosphere.  The other location in Toronto is a much better experience but stay away from this place, there are far better options in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"I dunno... didn't really \"meat\" the hype!  Service was awesome - but the wings had a lot of oil on them, which typically leads to tummy aches.  I got the medium hot and found them to be alright at best.  DO: get the dill sauce... totally trumps St. Louis's version of dill!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Duff's for 6 years now, but its reputation far pre-dates my entry on the scene. This \"wing joint\" is known for the best wings in the city and it delivers, but doesn't really deliver by car!! *giggles*  The wings are good-sized, not those itsy-bitsy ones. You have a great variety of choice in your preferred level of heat.  Service is fast and friendly. Yes, seating is a bit cramped, but that's only cuz they are this little local shop, with a HUGE following!!  I recommend Duff's if you're in the mood for wings, maybe some beer and fries. The menu is somewhat lacking in variety of much more than that.  But do not let this deter you from the ultimate wing, get your fingers sloppy and sticky, dining experience!!  Duff's does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"My family and I had a wonderful time at this restaurant. The best wings we've ever had. The servers were very helpful explaining what we should get for our table to ensure we would have a great time. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm not a wings lover but the size is pretty good not oily, the flavor options are OK  very friendly staff. Special on Tuesday as for the other items on the menu  stick to the celery sticks"}
{"text":"We moved here 3 months ago and have eaten here frequently. The service is amazing, I think the food is delicious,  we are a huge fan of all their wings..They have great burgers and I love their chicken wraps! ! My favorite is the Greek chicken wrap. I don't know why it has received poor reviews bc it has been our go to place and always happy with everything there. GREAT ATMOSPHERE TOO!"}
{"text":"Wings are superb. I really love their wings and I always come here whenever I feel like wings. Having said that, everything else is not that great. Some appetizers taste like frozen food. Only the wings are good. Come here for wings only!"}
{"text":"Wings = perfectly cooked Spiciness = overhyped  I went to Duff's for the first time as I'm always looking for a place with hot enough food to slow me down, and numerous people told me Duff's could be that place to bring me to my knees; I've never had restaurant food that could do it so I was excited.  What I found was that the wings were awesome, they were perfectly cooked and breaded, just the perfect chicken wing.  I'm a wing nut and this and a small pub known as Westend in hamilton are the only two places I've eaten at that do wings properly.  The spice level is greatly overhyped though, I ordered armageddon and asked for them extra saucy, I got them and was immediately disappointed by the heat level; I should mention the flavour of the sauce was awesome.  Got half way through and still didn't have a tingle so I got a bowl of armageddon sauce on the side and started using the wings as spoons to scoop the sauce into my mouth seeing if it would give me a burn at any point, it didn't.  I ended up just spooning all the sauce into my mouth and got a light tingle but that was it.  I'm a spicy food not and I have a very high tolerance so if you aren't they may very well still seem obscenely hot, but that being said I can still make hot sauces at home that I will struggle with and for all the hype and the \"armageddon\" label these didn't come close.  I'll still definitely go back though because the wings and flavours were top notch but sadly my search for a food joint in toronto that can give me a burn continues.  If anybody knows any places that could potentially do it reply and let me know."}
{"text":"A great wings place for me has to offer juicy plump wings and a decent selection of beer. This place meets those two criteria of mine. The only thing they're lacking are different flavours, granted they have a gazillion different levels of hotness for the wings but that doesn't equal different flavours. We had an order of medium and a order of bbq wings. I prefer the medium sauce, just the right amount of hotness. For jokes a friend of mine dared another friend to try the armageddon sauce which is the Holy Grail of hotness. A siren goes off in the restaurant when someone orders it, I guess it's a warning that someone will get hurt real bad. Just taking a whiff of it will burn your nose. For kicks I decided to try it first, i took one small bite and my eyes watered, head was pounding, then I started to get heart palpitations, and began to sweat profusely, to top it all off my lips and mouth burned for a good hour. Meanwhile my buddy was able to eat the whole wing without breaking a sweat, which I applaud and admire greatly. How he was able to do it, I really don't know. I would never put myself through that much agony again! The name armageddon was appropriate, it did feel like my world was ending, a slow and painful death.   Another plus about this place is that they offer poutine for an additional charge to come with your warp/burger/sandwich. It's a heart attack waiting to happen with all the fried food, but hey, might as well go all out! Poutines should be mandatory in all bars across Canada. The sandwiches/warps/burgers look like they were the typical fare you'll find in other bars, nothing to write home about. My Duff's crispy chicken sandwich was good but nothing to rave about, come here for the wings."}
{"text":"I am a big wing fan.  Duffs wings are ok but definitely there are places that make better wings such as the Real Game downtown and St Lois.   I went there last night and picked up some wings.   The wings were ready by the bar but the person who took my order made me wait unnecessarily.    That was disappointing as it shows a lack of respect for customers coming in to order take out.   You shouldn't make folks wait when their food is ready."}
{"text":"I'm crazy for wings.  I'm not too wild about bone-in wings because the bone part takes up room where the meat should be.  My friend told me that this place was the chillest, so I decided to give it a whirl.  We went in there and sat down.  First things first, the waitresses are mostly super banging.  Toronto has some of the hottest girls worldwide son, so you know this place is going to have them correct hunnies working.  They have pitchers of brews and super spicy wings.  You can get some wings that will punish the hell out of you, mine made my forehead sweat like a whore in Church.  I loved it though.  They've also got some excellent apps, but we didn't waste our time with them.  It's a nice place to go with friends if you want to snack on some dank wings, see aboot a hockey game, eh?, or pound some brews and lecherously scam on the waitresses who aren't into you at all.  That's aboot it."}
{"text":"The wings were good, but I've had better... I liked them, but I don't crave them. The ambiance was ok, but not overly amazing. The service was good and the place clean."}
{"text":"Wings are great. Celery is nice and crispy. Biggest downside is the price. 16$ for 1 pound of wings is mother*ing expensive."}
{"text":"Really good wings.  I live a few steps from St Louis on Yonge, but I truly prefer Duff's.  Their fries are thin and crispy.  Their wings taste better.    We had 3 flavours.  The Medium, Honey garlic, and BBQ.  I only ever go to this location so this review is solely based on this location."}
{"text":"Sometimes you wanna just be real manly and gnaw on some hot meats, you know?** And as far as I'm concerned, this Duff's has the best wings in the city. Seriously - I've been known to order from this location and ask them to put the order in a cab for me. That's real chicken loyalty.  If you're into breaded-dip-in-le-sauce wings, you won't get them here. Duff's wings are saucy, messy and gargantuan. The heat levels are pretty insane - Hot wings are 35,000 on the scoville scale, and the next step up (Superhot) is 150,000. I don't even know the Armageddon rating because frankly, they terrify me a little bit. I never get anything more or less than Hot, because I think they're perfect.  If you're craving some patio action, they've got good deals that include 20 wings, fries and a pitcher for... I don't know how many dollars. I'm very helpful, I know. Just letting you know it's an option.  **I attempt to be as girly as possible while at the same time, being very manly. Example: dainty bites and one-handed lifts, but with SUPERHOT SAUCE."}
{"text":"One of the best chicken wing places in Toronto. The staff is great and the service is fast. The wings are meaty and plentiful. The wings are full of sauce and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Our favourite wings in all Ontario. Love their wings. Started going when they were in Buffalo. Then when they opened on Bayview, downtown, and still going to their Vaughan location. The best wings anywhere."}
{"text":"Honestly, I am so disappointed with the service :(   No one approach us after we seated for 10-15mins. They have lots of staff walking around and I don't understand why no one ever tried to take our order. And so we walked out and went to a different restaurant down the street and they have much better service."}
{"text":"Ordered take out wings, buffalo mild and honey garlic.  It was Horrid!  The honey garlic sauce was gelatinous, and did not taste garlicky at all.  The buffalo wings were very sad!  Hardly any flavor!  The wings were very small, considering the price was very large!  I have had better tasting frozen wings from Presidents Choice!  We will never order there again!."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Once again the service was quick, friendly and the food fresh and delicious.   Despite only having the basic flavours, I still think this is one of the best wing places in the city.   Also, the washrooms are always clean for that après wings \"clean up\"."}
{"text":"We order 50 Wings in Plain, Honey Garlic and BBQ plus 20 Wings + Large Fries + Small Pitcher of Pop.  The size of the wings is small but eventually we cannot finish all 70 wings with a group of 6!  The surface of the wings is dried but the meat is juicy.  With the fries, it fills up the stomach much faster.  The service is not exceptional but standard.  We are left alone unless we wave our hands.  The restroom can be cleaned better."}
{"text":"The wings were the worst prepared chicken I have ever had. The only thing you taste is vinegar and pepper. My six year old sister could make a better sauce. It's really hot but that's all it is. You don't taste anything except the pepper, and that's their signature dish for christ sake. Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"Been eating at Duffs for several years. Today I went for lunch and ordered  the hot wings as I usually do. Order consisted of 8 Miniscule wings that were severely overcooked. Essentially chicken skin bark. The meat was jerky like. I asked them to remake them and they did so. The remade wings were only slightly better, and consisted of 6 wings  They told me I had eaten 2 in the first order.  The manager was a real dick about the whole situation and considering the place was near empty, I was surprised he didn't value the fact our table of 3 spent well over $ 80.00 including beers. .   This place has gone downhill so badly, I wonder how  long they can survive on the highly competitive Bayview strip.  Should have chosen one of the many other options nearby.  I won't return for overpriced, overrated food dished along with attitude from the weenie manager on duty."}
{"text":"Personally, I find there wings too \"saucy\". The wings are large and very hearty, however all you can taste is the sauce they use. The hot sauce is very hot (as advertised), but it isn't very favourable. Just hot. They have some good beer and wings deals if you are looking for a guys night."}
{"text":"I have probably googled \"best wings in Toronto\" dozens of times. Duffs is often high on that list but it wasn't until yesterday that I finally had a chance to sample their wares.  The service was good at lunch hour so no complaints in that department (there were only four or five other tables). I was impressed that they had Beau's Tread lager on draft so I had a pint of that. I had 10 medium wings and the spice level was good, a little closer to hot. I also had 10 hot honey garlic and they were an excellent flavour.  These are non breaded, deep-fried wings that were good not great.  They were a little dry, a little tough and VERY saucy.  Overall, they were good but I don't know that I would put them that high on a list of best wings in Toronto. We also had deep-fried pickles that were pretty tasty.  Check this place out for good service, beer and wings."}
{"text":"Its alright, but nowhere near as good as the original duffs in buffalo.  Wings were a little oily and lacking on the sauce.  What a disappointment since the one in ny gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"Heard an read so much about duffs andd it's quality of wing, certainly held up to expectation. Had the mild wings and sampler platter with a side of the famous armageddon hot sauce. Everything had my taste buds burning for more. Great place."}
{"text":"No need to drive south of the border when you have Duff's in Toronto.  Real Buffalo wings in the GTA The wings are Huge there's no way you can find bigger wing anywhere , the wings are flavourful and filling as well.  The sauce is perfect just like buffalo wing are meant  to be , they have a few other wing flavors that I can't comment on because I have never tried them myself but I'm sure you can find something that will appeal to you.  If you like your wings with rib sauce this is not the place for you  or maybe wings just aren't for you who actually enjoys sweet wings. Really rib sauce on wings Yuk. Just as good as the Ancor Bar without the drive to Buffalo."}
{"text":"Yes these wings are good I still like the Anor Bar better .But that's a long drive.  So Duff's are great And they got some Nice cold Beer Yummy!"}
{"text":"Dropped by last night on a Friday night drinking adventure. Dropped in since they had a sign for FAMOUS WINGS. I mean.. there is nothing better than a pound of wings when you're tipsy.   I ordered the Hot Honey Wings and they were SO GOOD!  I mean, these are the best wings I have ever had.   The only thing that was kind of weird was that they serve the carrot & celery first ... I mean like 15 minutes before the wings come out. I don't know, I just thought that was weird.  The service was great but the table kind of had that awful dirty towel smell but we had our waitress wipe it down again.   Happy Belly!"}
{"text":"Everything is super fresh (locally sourced, I asked) and the wings are killer. My husband gets them big and saucy, how Buffalo wings are supposed to be, and I get them plain and dip... yum. We always go with friends who aren't big wing eaters and they love the saucy chicken fingers and greek wraps."}
{"text":"You know your in Toronto when they have to put honey-garlic wings on the menu to cater to the bland tounged locals. The mothership on Sheridan Ave. has no other wing type than the one of its fair city. If you are going to attempt to copy the real Duffs, you might want to keep it authentic. The buffalo wings are decent here; however, putting boneless wings on the menu is simply a travesty!  Additionally, at least put some Genesee on the beer selection!!"}
{"text":"Duffs certainly offers my favorite wings in the city and I've been eating there since it opened. However, price wise, there's no arguing that it's very high for a wing n beer joint. If you've ever been to the original in Buffalo, you know that it's about double the money to eat at the locations in Toronto. I get the extra food cost thanks to Canada's ag board pricing on poultry and of course the taxes on booze, but still, they take it way beyond that.   I will still eat here forever, but the gouge will always annoy me."}
{"text":"I love duffs. We've been coming here since the late 90's when we moved to the city. We've been gone for a decade now but every time we come back we make a point of coming here! And the best thing is that NOTHING has changed...same great food, same great atmosphere...love it!"}
{"text":"Favourite wing place bar none. Their fries are only ok, but then again you don't go to Duff's for fries, you go for crispy, juicy, saucy wings!"}
{"text":"20 wings: $20.50! I couldn't believe it. That's what you normally pay for a decent steak. But wings? Even the server owned up to the ridiculous price they were asking. So add a side of fries, another order of wings and a beer or two and you're looking at a $80 night! Unreal. Avoid this like the plague. GIANT RIP OFF! They're wings. Nothing more. And these, by the way, are no better than almost anywhere I've been. The only difference is the price."}
{"text":"Duff's, the Mecca of chicken wings in Toronto. Not only their wings size is above average size, but the flavour is one of the best I've tried so far.  A good deal is to purchase one of the combos, that includes wings, fries and pop or beer, and then enjoy a finger licking experience.  Do trust the menu, and the servers t-shirts warning: medium is hot, medium hot is VERY HOT, and hot is VERY VERY HOT... so order accordingly  :)"}
{"text":"Regular customer here. 3 stars because this place is a hit or miss each time you come. I've had times were the wings, appetizers, drinks and service to be great. There's been times where the drinks, service and food was very lacking and disappointing.  Overall, their wings are great! They are not so busy on weeknights so you can get a seat quickly. Parking is convenient.   The servers are very friendly and the food arrives to your table pretty fast.  Would recommend for all wing lovers to try!"}
{"text":"On a cold winter night a friend wanted some wings and Buffalo's Duff's came to mind.  Having tried my share of wing places I wanted to see what made the difference at Duff's.  We had the honey garlic, Buffalo (medium), and salt and pepper.  The sides of carrot and celery is what you expect, and the Buffalo was indeed as spicy as they advertise, even at the medium spiciness.  Honey garlic was good and not to saucy, and the salt and pepper was fine as well.    Overall I would say the quality is solid but the other wing places have more sauce options that may suit everybody's tastes rather than the narrower selection at Duff's."}
{"text":"Wings are good. Mad good? Not so sure... Ultimately it comes down to whether you like your wings big or small. These are small-style wings, which means a little meat and a lot of flavour. Great spectrum of sauces and the hot is HOT. Fries are good and crispy and the ambience is fine. Service was regular and beer was a bit more expensive than it ought to be (especially with Toby's just down the street) but it's definitely the only place in town with such a wide spectrum of hot sauces. I like my wings hot, and at Duff's they can deliver. Also, they actually do deliver."}
{"text":"Overpriced for bland wings that relies on the sauce.  Service is bad, long wait for waitresses to come around and the manager is rude."}
{"text":"Wings were just plain fried... No marinate... No taste to the chicken without sauce and the sauce isn't that special.  Sorry... Just didn't win my vote at all... Other franchises are better.  If you want to know test how good the wing is then try it without sauce and see how it tastes.  Otherwise I could fry my own wings and just add sauce... No need to go out to a restaurant if I can do the same or better myself."}
{"text":"Crossing my fingers that it tasted as i remembered from Buffalo! And I think it brings me back.   Pretty empty on a weekday afternoon. Great attentive service.   Mild medium had a mild kick. Honey garlic was tasty. Then we added smokey barbecue which we could have lived without but still tasty."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best place for wings in Toronto, especially if you like your wings spicy!   I have regularly eaten at duffs for about 4 years now and have never had any complaints. The service has been consistently good every time I have been there and the wait times are reasonable even when the place is packed.   It is a relatively small restaurant though and being popular, they tend to fill up fast on weekends and Tuesday nights (which is their wing special night) so there does tend to be ~20 min waits on those nights.  The food is great though, they easily have some of the hottest wings in Toronto and  I wouldn't recommend the top 3 hottest flavours to anyone who cant take some SERIOUS heat. For those who don't enjoy clearing their sinuses and sweating profusely while eating wings I would highly recommend the \"hot honey garlic\" which is one of the tastiest wing flavours my friends and I have ever had. Their onion rings are also among the best; fresh, crispy and delicious and I highly recommend them over fries as a side.   Overall its a great place to go if you are in the mood for wings, more of a restaurant than a bar however they do have a bunch of TVs on the walls to watch games. Food is usually about 15-20 bucks a head and drinks are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I was planning to eat here more than 7 years ago when I saw their placed packed at the college branch. It's really sad that I've only tried their wings recently. At least I've got yelp now so that's a positive.  I find the wings bigger than other places which has to be what sets them apart. The wing options though need some work. I think there only 5 options or maybe less. All star wings hands down on the wing option department.  Other than that, service, prices, and everything else are pretty much standard."}
{"text":"The servers are rude at best, the food is small portions  for the amount you pay and its nothing great. They dont like it when you ask for a container to take things home. The drinks taste very watered down if you order pop.   They try to rush you out at the end."}
{"text":"Very good quality of chicken wings, but not the best in the city. Service is fast, prices are affordable but overpriced."}
{"text":"I remember driving to Buffalo, NY to eat at Duff's -- I don't remember if it was the purpose of the trip, but I do remember it being a highlight. For my friends Duff's was a legend, \"The best wings ever\" they used to drool -- and then slowly they began to appear in the GTA and somewhere along the line this anomaly just became part of the everyday Toronto landscape.  Now, I still do like the wings -- the sauce is not especially special, but it IS classic and after a number of disappointing experiences with weird flavours elsewhere I'll stick with classic any day.    The quality and freshness is right up there and I was surprised to read in The Toronto Star's occasional column \"The Dish\" that 10 wings from Duff's only accounts for 539 calories (versus 10 wings from Kelsey's which pack a whopping 1,110 calories) That almost seems reasonable doesn't it?  The restaurant is almost a palace compared to the original Buffalo, NY location -- though the atmosphere has a very pedestrian sports bar feel that kind of makes me wish I was sitting in the original grubby dive... At least that place had some street cred."}
{"text":"The wings tasted like they were made overnight and added the sauce at time of the order..... NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Wings were decent enough but we were told to keep it down by the manager for laughing too loud....seriously. Will never return here or to any other Duff's for that matter."}
{"text":"Like the 1st reviewer, I've been coming here since high school, well over a decade ago.  I know, I know, I look way too young to be that old, but I'm comfortable with my age!  I remember going for $0.10/wing nights, or was it $0.19/wing?  Either way, it was CHEAP!  Tonite was no different but I just wish they had a little more selection.  I am still a fan of the honey garlic sauce.  And I only had the mild, because of the company with me, but I really want to try some of the hotter ones.  They have one called \"Armageddon\"......SPICY!  One guy had his name on the board as eating 60 of these super hot wings.  Who eats 60 wings??!!!  I can't even finish 10."}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to love this place. We ordered 3 lbs of wings and large fries on our first visit here. 2 lbs - salt & pepper, 1 lb honey garlic. The coatings for each were really good, but the chicken was so dry. With each wing I kept hoping the next one would be better because this place was an institution and highly regarded. My boys gave it a thumbs up devouring the salt & pepper wings but admitted the meat was dry. Sorry Duff's, 1 star from me :("}
{"text":"Recently a group of reckless foodie thrill seekers banded together to form the Yelp Wing Warriors and we endeavor to travel around the Greater Toronto Area sampling the hotest and craziest flavours of chicken wings around.  Our first official meet up took place just over a week ago and Duff's Famous Wings was the place. The Target, tempting fate and the \"end of the world as we know it\" by tangoing with the mighty Armageddon.  I would honestly say that the hype and anticipation were almost, and I say almost worse that the wings them selves. The night we visited Duffs was wing night and for $7 ad change and the purchase of a drink you get a pound of their \"famous\" wings. We opted to each get a different flavour and speaking of flavours I like that they've kept to the classics: Medium, Hot, Extra Hot, Suicide, Super Suicide, Death and Armageddon. Each having a similar flavour base just upping the heat as you go.    Their claim to fame is that someone has eaten 70 Armageddons in an hour so we decided that we would order and extra pound of this spicy beast and share amongst our group. I managed to down about 3 of these and while I enjoyed the taste of the Armageddon it was certainly manageable and I can see how someone with a big appetite was able to down 70 of them and live to tell the tale.   Overall nothing mind blowing, taste buds were slightly numb and next day the morning festivities were certainly spicy. HOWEVER, if Armageddon truly represented \"the end of the world as we know it\" then... \"I feel fine.\"  Live to Wing Another Day.  Eatcrest OUT!!"}
{"text":"Really good. The heat on the wings are actually on point. I'm used to going to restaurants and ordering their hottest wings and having it be somewhat mild. This place you need to do the opposite! I ordered medium hot and my mouth was on fire. In a good way though, I could've went up to hot and ate them comfortable, but nothing past that.  I also had their strawberry goat cheese salad which was VERY good. I wasn't expecting that from a wing place. Great job."}
{"text":"How I wish I read Jennifer & Wayne's reviews before visiting this location, what a hurtin' dinner my friends and I experienced.   As previously stated, the wings were dry and chewy, overly so.   Let me begin this rant by stating I can't stand the fact that they have the following slogan plastered all over the walls of their locations, the staff's t-shirts and headlining their website:  Warning: MEDIUM is HOT MEDIUM-HOT is VERY HOT HOT is VERY, VERY HOT  First of all. The MEDIUM is comparable to a watered down Tobasco. The MEDIUM HOT is probably straight Tobasco. The HOT is probably Tobasco w/ Frank's. Bottom line the wings here are not that hot at all. I was so dissatisfied with the heat I had to order a side of DEATH sauce, the 2nd hottest sauce they had on their menu. Even that received a beat down. I would love to go back to smash their Armageddon sauce, the hottest sauce they offer but I can't justify spending any more $ at this establishment. Also, where do they get the balls to name their spiciest wing Armageddon, didn't All-Stars own that long before them? Regardless, you would think this heat mission statement was coined by a 4 yr old as far away from India as possible.   In addition to this scoville mockery, I also ordered the spicy BBQ which was nothign special at all. It was so evident this sauce came out of a 3L jug and simpley did not taste good at all.    To top off the whole experience, we ordered onion scoops only to find a piece of paper in one of them. A small square rectangular piece of yellow paper inside an onion scoop!!! It was unchewable and clearly some form of wax paper as it was fibrous. We informed our waitress and she only took the nearly full basket of scoops away from our table and off our bill, that's it. I couldn't help but notice these are also the exact same onion scoops that All-Stars carries.   Believe me I hate ranting on establishments, I really do. But this experience was rough. However, despite this 1* review I am certain this Duff's location will still thrive. It was packed the Sunday night I was in there and the parking lot consistently remains to be so.  On the only positive note service was good and staff were attentive. There were a fair amount of LCD's scattered around the restaurant which makes it a good venue to watch football and other sporting events.   Overall though a terrible experience at Duff's. Such a shame as it is less then a 1 minute drive from my house and they have a nice patio. I still to this day have not had better wings than Turtlejack's, anywhere."}
{"text":"I have no clue how these are \"famous\"  The good: - The wait staff was very friendly, very quick service, awesome. We shared some scuttlebutt - The ceasar + grilled chicken was pretty tasty. I asked them to not drown the ceasar (as places are want to do), and it came as I asked.  The bad: - The wing selection is terrible. Not even dusted wings?! How can you call yourself a wing place without dusted wings - The wings themselves were fried garbage. Tasteless, heavy on the oil ... sigh  I was actually quite annoyed with myself that I wasted a meal here. Skip."}
{"text":"Besides the place was pretty crowded and we spent almost 1 hour to get our table las time that I've been there, I love this place. The honey garlic wings are amazing. The combo has a reasonable price, and everyone there is very kind and attempt to the customers. Also they do have a range of hot wings that you can challenge your friends to eat. It was really surprising when the top 5, that had eaten the most hottest wings weren't Indian people."}
{"text":"My waitress had a very bad attitude. When I asked her about the size of food because it was my first time being there, she was sarcastically replied me \"hmm, look at that table close to you , and you will see\" She also made a mistake about our order but rather than apologizing, she said \"misunderstanding happens, its ok\". I was shocked how rude a waitress could be????? She even threw things to our table. When we complained about it to the manager , he apologized many times but we already paid a pricy bill of course with no tip with no courtesy. I won't return"}
{"text":"I love Duff's. I really do. I don't think I've ever been disappointed with a meal there. Wings are deep fried, they will be greasy. Once you come to terms with that, you will have a tasty experience.   Our orders never vary. We always get the deep fried pickles (might even be the best in the city), potato wedges (SO GOOD!) and of course wings. I always order medium hot and my friends get Hot Honey Garlic (wusses). :)  Service is good and fast. Only problem we ever run into are the table runners wanting to clear our table before we're actually done."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere is great but the wings could be better. Wings seamed dry and thin .  Could be that I'm used to breaded wings .  Hot wings are a good heat but if you want a challenge go higher in the heat. Place is busy so I guess people like their wings crispy."}
{"text":"First time here. Was going to order the wings but the night before we had wings at Costco. So decided on the chicken wrap. Nothing that will blow your socks off. The staff was friendly. Would have to come again to try their wings."}
{"text":"Went here to watch the first (painful) Leafs' play-off game.  We got there early, unsure if it would be packed - it did get busy, but not until about 7:45 pm or so, so just a normal crowd, I'd assume, not tied to the game.  Service was excellent.  Friendly, over-accomodating. In this regard, Duff's does a great job.  I did enjoy my food, but it was nothing special (to me, anyway...I don't really like wings) to have me coming back \"just 'cause\".  They have a big open window in the front which is lovely for nice summer nights.  Overall, I enjoyed my experience because of the service."}
{"text":"Basic food, drinks, atmosphere..... outstanding wings. Worth trying.  I had the hot honey garlic and also tried the mild. These are extra crispy wings. Some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"When you have the word \"famous\" on your business name, you either setting yourself up for greatness or failure. In the case of Duff's, its the former and not the latter fortunately.   We came here on a Thursday night, a pre Super Bowl get together, to try their \"famous\" wings. Unfortunately, it was a little challenging getting to this place because of construction along Eglinton. Also parking can be problematic as only street parking is available with a P Lot parking or side street parking available along Bayview and Millwood.  It was fairly busy when we got there at 7pm but we were able to get a table for 5 without any wait. Unfortunately for us, it was located right by the sliding door in the front with a little draft coming in. We didn't mind it too much. Once everyone in our party arrived, we were able to order right away. We ordered the 5 lbs of wings with 3 flavours for $54. We decided to go with honey garlic, BBQ and Mild Medium for the sauces. Also we ordered the Sweet Potatoes Fries and regular fries as sides. Both of the fries were average at best. I didn't like the Sweet Potatoes fries as it wasn't crispy and was very soft.   I usually like breaded wings but for the non breaded variety, Duff's wings are very good. The wings were meaty and sauces on point. I felt the best sauce was the Honey Garlic as our group didn't try their spicy variety.   Service was above average as our order came out fairly quick and they did check up on us, once in a while. They have various TVs throughout the restaurant and at the time, they had both the Raptors and Leafs games on.   This place lives up to their name and it is highly recommended!   BTW, they are other items on the menu but who comes here to order anything besides wings?  #14 of 2018"}
{"text":"I love the wings here! I always get medium, which are a little hot, but still pretty tasty. Never had an issue with service, has always been pretty good, even on the cheap Tuesday nights."}
{"text":"They're famous for a reason - these are fabulous wings! Meaty, saucy, and larger than most I've had before. Sadly, their appetizers lack much except grease. Everything is breaded and deep-fried, including the fries it seems. I now know what to order in future - wings to go..."}
{"text":"Great wings. Sweet potato fries are also really delicious. Quick and attentive service."}
{"text":"Decent wings, don't like that they are quite skinny, and don't have a lot of meat on them. They always put so much sauce and always gets wasted and wings get drenched in sauce. I've tried better wings but if you are in the area I guess you can give it a try. Been there a few times but still believe it isn't anything special. There are better wing places out there. Friendly staff, OK food."}
{"text":"Worst wings I ever had!!!  I think the wings were frozen then thawed in the microwave. The flesh was tough! And extremely dry!!!  $ 3.95 for frozen French fries??  Extremely disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"I bought 10 wings here and omg, it was the worst wings I have ever tasted!!!! Will never go again. I ate 3 and threw the rest out."}
{"text":"I love wings and Duff's does it really really well.  The wings are large, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside - done just the way I like it!  They're flavourful both inside and out, which is something that is actually much harder to find than you would think.  Flavours go from no heat (honey garlic - so yummy!) to super uber burning hot (Armageddon).  Love this place!  This place is really small though I really like the cozy atmosphere.  It's tough to get seating here, so we enjoyed a pint of Guinness instead at the bar while waiting for our 50 wing take out.  There's a good patio outside though it was a bit too cold to take advantage of it!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with great wings. They're a little dry but they do just fine in house and spicy. The burger was more than modest, although nothing spectacular. I gave 3 stars because of a few reasons. For 1 they forgot to put the pops, napkins, and utensils in the bag(for the salad) which was very vexing because we are at sunnybrook hospital and would've like our meal complete lol. 2, the salad was already mixed causing it to be soggy."}
{"text":"The BEST hot wings in the world.  Bar none.  OK, maybe the Duff's in Buffalo is an acceptable alternative, but still...  I'm based out of Los Angeles these days and I miss these wings!  I still rock my Duff's t-shirt though."}
{"text":"We ordered 1lb medium authentic buffalo wings. It's too sour, salty, and dry. We tried the first one  piece then we left!"}
{"text":"Tuesday nites @ Duff's- evidently the place to be.   I'm not sure that the Tues nite deal is Really such an amazing deal...since the normal price is $10.95 for 10 wings...and it's $7.25 on Tues when you buy a drink (around $2.25 for a loganberry drink); i mean...it's slightly cheaper, but if you have to stand in line for 30 mins...then maybe not such a great deal  but whatever.  let's review the wings  Medium Hot:  Not very hot. I mean, it's normal spicy for hot wings.  But juicy, tasty and yea, prob my fave wings amongst the 4 we got  Hot Honey Garlic: Sweet and spicy; a good blend, but some wings were a tad too sweet  Bold BBQ: Smokey mesquite.  way too much BBQ sauce. it wasn't really necessary to drench it in SO much BBQ sauce. made it too salty  Honey Garlic: a little too sweet  Sweet Potato Fries: my fave thing there  So overall, i thought it was pretty good...but i wouldn't crave it.  WIng Stop in SoCal, US is WAY more addictive...and cheaper"}
{"text":"Amazing wings Great service Lots of seating Great for families My kids love the macaroni triangles We usually go to Hollywood Gelato after Duff's for dessert"}
{"text":"Great place to have wings and a beer. The wings are big and juicy, not as much flavors as I thought there would be but yummy none the less. Highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The hot is very hot. They say it on their shirts, their menu, their front door, and they're not joking.   The best wings in Toronto hands down, I am never disappointed here. The wings are massive compared to everywhere else, you really don't need another wing spot. Come early on Tuesdays as the line up gets crazy!  The staff is excellent, they are very polite and attentive. Even on the busiest nights they get it down to hustle to each table, it's respective of their management styles as I've been to other Duffs and had the same excellent service. A+ to their staff"}
{"text":"My favourite wing place in the GTA. The staff is great and the food is amazing. I've never been disappointed, everyone should try the deep fried Mac and Cheese.  Great place to watch a game although it gets busy on big nights. But really you're there for the food and like I previously stated, best wings in Toronto. Hands down!"}
{"text":"WING NIGHT!  Always an exciting time.  We stopped in and were promptly greeted and seated by the open air store front.  Our waitress was incredibly nice and attentive.  We ordered the appetizer sampler, aka, everything FRIED.  REALLY yummy.  You cannot go wrong with jalapeno poppers.   But, alas, 3 stars because I find Duff's wings really greasy.  Everyone tells me how great they are but each and every time I always leave wanting more."}
{"text":"Basically, Duff's makes above average wings with roughly average sauces and sides, but they do it consistently and with decent service, so I've been back a bunch of times.  Their wings are pretty good. It's not always easy to tell because the sauce masks the pure taste of the wings. Get the sauce on the side sometime, and it'll be easier to judge the wings themselves, IMO. I've definitely had wings I like better and sauces I like better, but Duff's is very reliably above-average for me.  The sauces are pretty solid, although their heat scale tends towards a vinegary flavour like tabasco that wouldn't be my choice. I have a high tolerance for spices, and their Armageddon is pretty spicy, but not intolerable. There are definitely people who wouldn't be able to handle it.  Service is friendly. Sides are fine.  I feel like their prices are high, but I basically feel that way about chicken wings everywhere now, so I can't really fault Duff's for that."}
{"text":"If I feel for wings, this is THE place. Best chicken wings I have ever tried out of all the wings franchises.  I always get my sauce separate and dip it myself to control the heat etc... I think its better that way, or its just me.  Great place to checkout far all those who love to get dirty with some beer and wings ;)"}
{"text":"Came here last night for the CMYE wing event.  It's a pretty good wing place, but suffers a few deficiencies.  The Good: Service is great, atmosphere is comfortable. Price is good, particularly on Tuesdays when you can get 10 wings for $7.45. Size and meatiness of wings is good.  The Bad: SUPER limited in wing choices. Basically you're asking how much heat you can get and maybe add honey or bbq sauce. No dry options, unless you get plain with sauce on the side. Also, we sampled the armageddon wings, which are supposed to be crazy spicy. They were pretty spicy, but I've accidentally made food this spicy before and been able to eat it all. I was hoping for something that would destroy me after one wing, with the strength of my will (and internal organs) being the only thing to keep me going.  So if you're looking for run of the mill wings, this is a great place to go. If you want some creativity in terms of flavour, or some face-meltingly hot wings, you may have to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I don't know if I have much to add to the general rave, but here it is:  -I don't like really spicy food, so I want a tasty wing, not one that makes the interior of my mouth start peeling.  Duff's wings taste great.  My favourite sauce is the honey garlic - sweet and dark with a good hit of garlic - but I always like to split two flavours with my table-mate and alternate them so the sweet doesn't get overpowering.  I love the wings.  Love love love.  I love the perfectly crispy exterior, the perfect meaty interior, and the flavour.  -All the best meals come with buckets.  -The Caesar isn't fancy, but it's just what it should be.  -The dill dip - yum!  -The beer selection isn't huge, but it's got what I want.  -I have no idea what the sides, desserts, or non-wing-foods taste like.  I imagine they're just fine - but why would I waste stomach space on something that isn't a wing when I'm here?  -I could wish for a little more elbow room, but let's not split hairs here."}
{"text":"Call me crazy but I'm giving this 5 stars for the following reasons. 1. There are several TVs throughout the place, though I never come there to watch a game. 2. There's a small patio at the front which is quite nice. 3. Whether you're 5, 25, or 55, this restaurant is suitable for pretty much everyone. Families are usually seated near the back though, mostly because the area can accommodate more people.  4. My boyfriend and I spend $30 for a great meal, plus leftovers to take home. 5. The place is clean, and I'm a stickler about hygiene.  6. Service is fast, and the staff is nice. 7. I have been here multiple times (4), in fact, if I'm ever in the area, for some reason this is my only option for a meal :P  8. Most of my friends in university completely agree with me and have recommended this place.   Ok I read some comments about the BBQ wings being \"too saucy\", but that's EXACTLY how me, my boyfriend, and my friends like them. :)"}
{"text":"Great wings place!! Good for a casual date night! Usually the wait time isn't too bad. Only thing is that I wish they have more flavour options - since I love dry rub flavours :)"}
{"text":"Went here for the very first time yesterday as I heard that their wings are cheaper on Tuesdays. I got the hot honey garlic which was pretty good. I like how the chicken was not breaded but still crispy. I think the wings are on the pricy side on a regular day. I did not like how you have to pay for dipping sauce like Bleu cheese dressing for my wings. I also thought that they didn't have a lot of sauces for their wings.   I had the blazin' onions with dill dipping sauce. That was okay too."}
{"text":"The wings here were really good. I'm more of a boneless wings person so I ordered the saucy chicken fingers and they were super good. I of course still tried the wings and they were delicious, and fortunately they do not skimp on the sauce here. The fries were also really crispy and the service was good. My only complaint is they only brought out celery and dip... no carrots?!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a Tuesday night. Since it was our first time we had no idea they had a wing special going on that night, so naturally there was a huge line up out the door. Luckily, there were 2 spots available by the bar.  We ordered 1lb of wings each (bold BBQ and honey garlic), onion rings, mac n' cheese wedges and a chocolate cake for dessert.   Everything was delicious however; I was not a huge fan of the wings. The bold BBQ flavour was amazing, and the 'flat' part of the wings were good BUT the 'drums' of the wings were incredibly chewy and really difficult to eat.   I wasted half of my wings due to it being inedible.   Although the service was great, I'm a little disappointed with the quality of wings. I will not be hurrying back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The fact that this wing empire only has a 3 and a half star rating, really upsets me. I now nominate my rating as the current and forever rating of duffs. Everything sold here is off the charts delicious. It's hard to find the perfect wing in toronto being surrounded by a lot of garbage *cough wild wings cough* , but I consider myself to be a wing and sauce aficionado. Their wings are perfectly crispy, none of that soggy battered skin here, that draws the fine line in your mind if it's even fully cooked yet, no ,duffs has perfected it's cook time. Sauces are obviously flavourful. They keep it simple here no ridiculous names just good wings. I recommend the hot honey garlic. Words really aren't enough to describe the wings here please just go and try them yourself."}
{"text":"Thank you Toronto for having a Duff's!  Living in Buffalo for a short time, I have an unhealthy love for wings. When I saw that Toronto had a Duff's, knew I had to go for dinner.   The wings were cooked to perfection and the sauces were even better. Buffalo and hot honey garlic are definite go to's.  Oh yeah, the fried pickle spears aren't a bad appetizer either!"}
{"text":"Duff's Famous Wings is located on the north side of College between Euclid and Manning in Little Italy.  Duff's is a legend back in Buffalo and this place pays homage to the original back in Amherst not very far from where I've bought numerous sets of tires at Dunn Tire.  I've never been to the original though, never and as far as Buffalo goes I've only been to the Anchor original once.  My impression of the Anchor was that is wasn't that great.  Perhaps my expectations were higher because of the name but really nothing stood out as superb regardless of them being the original or not.  Duff's I've seen win against the Anchor on Food Wars so since each has their following I figure I should try Duff's.  We have numerous locations for both Anchor and Duff's in the GTA so although this isn't the original I'm guessing they go by the same standards and recipes.  We went to the place on a Thursday (March 22) and I have to say the place was packed, packed and noisy, very noisy.  I found ourselves having to almost scream to talk.  I was amazed how noisy it was inside.  I get it though it's a sports bar with wings and beer.  That is like a magnet for sports loving men like me.  Honestly I just wanted to eat there and try their chicken.  My friend Monica was taking us out for an early birthday dinner for me and it was a short walk from their place.  My wife ordered lemon pepper and I had asked for the hot.  The menu says something to the effect that mild is medium, medium is hot and hot is very hot.  That's sort of a subjective statement but I suppose if you're going by what others out there consider to be mild, medium and hot I guess that's one way to measure.  I still went with their hot but not death or the even hotter because I want to gauge how it is first.  I'm necessarily looking for the hottest wings although I like a hot bite from time to time.    The hot wasn't really hot for me but it definitely had a decent sting to it.  I could have gone hotter but it wasn't really necessary.  I liked the flavor and the chicken.  The drums portions of the wings were large but the flats portions seems almost disproportionate to the size of the drums.  I'd expect bigger flats with larger drums on split wings.  I could be mistaken but it was my observation.  I've eaten a lot of fried chicken in my life to know.  I'm guessing roaster wings but again, larger drums to flats but it could have just been our batch.  Being large and by the pound don't expect more than a bowl for a pound which is about 8 large pieces.  The wings were naked, and sauced quite well.  The sauce was not conservative by any means on the hot wings.  The tang and smell was great, not too much of a vinegar tang but a saucy sting.    Gauging the hot being the way it was I'm happy I didn't order medium because I think their hot for me is in the Goldilocks zone.  I like my wings just about what they served as hot.  Any hotter would have been fine but the flavor was great.    Along with the wings they give generous servings of both dill and blue cheese along with veg to dip. We also had their fried pickles and mac and cheese bites.  Both were good but the star of this place is their wings.  Big, meaty sauced and tasty.  I had one honey garlic to try and it was also good.  I'd be interested to try other flavors.  The dry ones like what my wife had (lemon pepper) were also very good.  Usually when I eat a lot of wings I like to have a variety of both sauced and dry.  The appetizers were good, the wings were better than just good.  The roasters alone is something you won't see as commonly used and while Duff's may be famous I can safely say they're much more satisfying and in my overall opinion they're just better than what the Anchor has to offer.  The only downside to this place is that it can be rather loud.  I'm assuming it would be even worse during a Leafs game or some other hometown game."}
{"text":"I've been going to Duff's for a few years now, and I am baffled by comments stating the wings are small. Where do you buy YOUR wings from?! These are some of the larger wings I've see in Toronto.   These guys specialize in heat. I've had sauces from Medium to Armageddon, and I prefer the Medium-Hot, or Hot. I find that's the perfect balance of heat and flavor. I've tried a couple of the mild flavors as well and they decently good.   Not the cheapest wings in the city, but you do get a solid bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Voted Best Wing Place by Cinnia  This place started up in New York and all I have to say is, Welcome to Canada!  I was so stoked when I saw those 4 letters stringed together D-U-F-F.  Go for it, try the suicide sauce.  - Reasonable prices for huge wings! - Awesome array of sauces to choose from - Normal selection of beer, but good thing it comes in tubs! - Offers other things on the menu, but come on, why would you bother?  Hot Tips: - The Hot Scale... pretty true to scale, I also find it gets more vinegar-y as you up the hot scale.  We were wavering between Superhot and Death, and I think we would have been able to handle death... - Suicide, let's talk about this, it will make your eyeballs sweat.  I'm not kidding, I tried it once in Philadelphia, the sauce hit my tongue and it went numb for 15 minutes... 'duff said."}
{"text":"We ordered 3lbs of wings, medium, lemon pepper and salt & pepper.  Wings were large, plump and nicely seasoned.  The medium was very mild--next time I would go up a level.  Our side of fries were huge but were from frozen.  But the carrots and celery were fresh.   I have to rate them poorly on their use of styrofoam for take out orders.  It is well documented that styrofoam and hot food should never mix hot foods straight out of a fryer should never come into contact with styrofoam.  The combination is a noxious mix of chemicals that can cause illnesses including cancer.  At the very least wax paper should be used to line the container creating a barrier to protect the food. Even better switch to using cardboard boxes or foil containers? Anyways just something to be aware of if your health matters to you."}
{"text":"I visited Duff's Wings a couple of times with my friends and we loved it. Pricing was good, the service was okay, considering they almost always had a full house. The wings themselves were exactly like I like my wings: lots of sauce and hot. Honey garlic also tasted great. Fries probably could have been better, but it's just fries, right?"}
{"text":"If you like chicken wings, this is the place for you. Doesn't get any better.  If you're feeling like a daredevil, go ahead and order some Armageddon wings. To make the sauce for those, they pretty much calculated what level of spiciness can kill a man, and than just took it back a notch."}
{"text":"Don't get anything but wings here, the rest is crap.  But the wings they do very well, much better than the rest of the chains.    I ordered the Armageddon wings, ten of them, which I split with my friend.  Man they were hot, but I made it through them fairly easily.  I paid dearly for it the next day.  How do these guys get on the board eating 40 or 50 of these?  I couldn't eat that many wings period let alone how hot they are!"}
{"text":"Used to be the best. Not anymore. F8ngers was over cooked that looked burnt, hard to chew.  The other order was bbq mild but it was dry wings. Over all the place sucks now."}
{"text":"Best wings you will have in Toronto. They have minimal flavors, but they do them all right. Wedges are awesome too."}
{"text":"The wings were large, crispy, and slathered with sauce. However, most of the sauces were practically neon coloured and really sour, at least of the four flavours we tried (medium, spicy BBQ, honey garlic, and Armageddon!!!). Lemon pepper (dry) was a better choice. Not a large selection of wing flavours compared to All Stars. Server was nice though and was able to split the shared bill for us (a group of eight) with no problem."}
{"text":"Nice and easy wings joint. Fries and sides are average -- almost like McDonalds fries. Wings are above average. Price is above average. Good environment and plenty of TVs.   The hot sauce is supposedly very hot. Too vinegary though. I liked the honey garlic better. Would come back with friends, but wouldn't go out of my way to come here. A-OK.   Service is very good."}
{"text":"Their sauce isn't anywhere near as hot as they claim it to be.  On the other hand, said sauce is mad tasty, with a great tang that finds you (me) running your (my) finger around the bowl after the last wing has been eaten.  The wings themselves were still crisp on the outside but nice and moist on the inside.  They also have a great range of cold beer, and a decent poutine for outside of Montreal."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! Not too expensive,my family gets over 100 wings from here sometimes and it does not take too long to make! Incredible barbeque chicken wings, even great the next day. For sure the best chicken wing joint in the city!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure I was ready to write about Duff's, yet. It's a pretty profound spiritual and salivary experience, even just sitting here thinking about it.  Sidebar: Try to understand, guys who like spicy food have a bit of a tough time of it. Any pursuit of spicy is read as machismo, and protests to the contrary just dig deeper. What can I say? I eat spicy on my own, when no one's looking. I promise. Some people just seem to have their spice receptors wired directly to endorphin release, and I'm one of em. So when I say this next thing, I hope it will be taken as the significant and earnest sentiment it is intended to be:  Duff's Armageddon wings are the single spiciest thing I have ever eaten.  You want the stock review? Okay: Duff's is a cozy little place along a nice strip of Bayview. There's always a line up, but they turn people over pretty quickly, and the owner's out there every night chatting with you and giving you the run down if it's your first time. The beer list is uninspiring and short, but gets the job done. The sides and appetizers are pretty good, indeed I genuinely like their fries - they aren't just along for the ride. All in all, it would be a fine little 3- or 4-star hangout depending on how you ranked space issues against tastiness.  But if you like spice, and I do, and it's my review so you'll just have to play along, this place is unreal. They list their wing sauces in terms of Scovilles, the dilution-based unit used to evaluate spiciness. I think that's gimmicky, and I'm almost certain their numbers are inflated, but it does signal quite effectively what kind of establishment you're entering. It is a kingdom of spice, the servers all wear shirts that say \"Remember, medium is hot, medium hot is very hot, hot is very very hot.\"  Above \"hot\" is \"super hot\" and through to this point we've been on a consistent, classic wing recipe. Strong vinegar, bright red/orange sauce with bright cayenne notes, big crisp wings with *great* heat. They could top out at Super Hot and even spice chasers would be happy. But they have two more offerings: Death and Armageddon. These two share a recipe with each other, but are vastly different from the others. A dark, smokey sauce with lots of Habañero and Scotch Bonnet. Beautiful smell when it hits the table, heat that hits your eyes.  And the spice? Unbelievable. I'd give Death a pass, no point in half measures once you're on this terrain. But the Armageddon is like nothing I've ever tasted. The sweats start right away, my fingers tingle and my eyes water and honestly, I start to get twitchy. My foot's tapping, I'm banging the table. How many meals do you have that get your whole body going this way? I have to stop and let my mouth recover after half an order, use some fries to soak up the heat, use some beer to break it down.   My brother and I will sometimes share a double order, half Armageddon, half Super Hot and while the super hot are tasty, their (substantial) heat is barely detectable in the post-Armageddon haze. We leave that place worn out - spent. Nowhere else have I had food that beat me up that much, or made me so happy to be beaten.  The owner says he can't personally handle anything above medium."}
{"text":"I got HIT through the Nasal Passages by VINEGAR just walking into this place and my spidey senses started to tingle. The weird part was that the patio and door was fully opened to let the TOXIC fumes escape.  Nice Classy place with HDTV showing games and wait staff were doing a decent job.  Good initial explanation to me about how things work around here and what we should do as Duff ROOKIES.  Honey Garlic, Mild Medium, and BBQ were our flavours in counts of 10 wings each.  I definitely see the BUFFALO method being used here but even at the first bite it was Tough, Dry & Chewy.    As you read this maybe a year later, I can still feel my stomach hate me as it tries to DIGEST cardboard.  OMG, I know it's not going to come out NICE, if you know what I mean.  The sauces are your normal Buttered Tabasco sauce which seems normal for Buffalo HOT Wings and I don't have much to complain about this end of things as it didn't give me indigestion.  While eating I even had daydreams of Pizza Pizza's Wings.  I guess I won't be dreaming of Duff's Famous Wings anytime soon."}
{"text":"2-Week Old Duff's isn't as popular as Menchie's next door but nonetheless it's still a welcome addition to this Rutherford Marketplace plaza. One point was that this Weekend afternoon the parking already felt limited within the front of the restaurant and watch out for the Children running around when you drive/park.   Maybe it's not prime-time the moment I stepped in so my 10-Wings($10.25) weren't dry or chewy as the ones I had at the College location. The Mild-Medium was a bit weak even for me, so I will stick to Medium next time. This time as a non-Buffalo Wing fan, I was happy with the outcome of my Wings.   There's around 6 LCD at every viewable angle perfect for those game-nights and there's even Patio space at this location. It didn't have as much as All-Stars(Vaughan) in terms of LCD and the decor I would say had some hybrid of Duff's and St. Louis(Woodbridge).   The Wait Staff were a bit lacking visible enthusiasm and they're brand spanking new as I asked when they close on Sunday Nights(11 pm) and 2 of the ladies tried their best to zoom in on the entrance door but the Hours on there were kind of tiny. It is newly opened, so definitely give some time for the staff to get up-to-stuff."}
{"text":"Went to this location on a Tuesday night for their 7$ pound special. There is fine print that you have to order a drink for this deal to be applicable. It was pretty busy, but my boyfriend and I managed to get a table for 2 pretty quickly. Staff were pleasant.   Total meal of 2lbs wings, 1 sprite, 1 beer, 1 small onion rings came to about 35$.   So, the Tuesday \"deal\" doesn't really save you too much... we were probably better off just ordering combos and coming on a less busy day. Wings were average - nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"Wing lovers on either side of the border know what's crackin... This place is a contender as the original buffalo wing joint. IDK which came first.. If this place is the chicken or the egg.. But believe you me... They've perfected the craft. This place is a \"purist\" wing joint. Meaning they fry their wings with no batter, bread crumb or coating, served with a vinegary hot sauce. I like my wings well done and crispy.. And ordered them so.. And they delivered with some frizzle fried chicken with the skin crispy like a cracker. I chose the second spiciest sauce, the \"death\" option. It was not painfully spicy it had flavor and was well received. I don't care if this place was the first second or latest to fry chicken wings and dunk em in hot sauce... But I do wish that there was a duffs for every Starbucks."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Service is sometimes a bit wonky but very nice staff and quick service!"}
{"text":"Firstly, I should make a point of saying that I don't eat as much greasy food as I did in the past, and after going to Duffs my digestive track is none to pleased with my behavior.   Duff wings are very saucy, and that sauce often contains quite a bit of oil. But hot damn they is some tasty wings. I like medium. It's hot enough to have some bite to it (to make your nose run a bit), but not hot enough to blind you if you scratch your eye by accident.  My girl likes Honey Garlic which is also very good. And unlike some other restaurants (St. Louis' for example) you'll have a tonne of extra sauce left when you are done you wings. If you love the sauce you get to drink it like left over milk from a cereal bowl.  Duffs' status as professional wing suppliers is shown by the fact they bring you a stack of napkins, and small bucket for all the bones and used napkins. Only the pros would be confident enough to put a garbage bin on the table with your food.  Tuesdays are half price, but not on doggy bags or take out.  Each order of wings comes with some celery sticks and your choice of dill or blue cheese dipping sauce. I recommend eating the celery to help counter-act the unhealthiness of your meal.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The wings at duffs are AMAZING the spicyBBQ wings are so good ! Sweet and spicy wings are the best .the staff are great the restaurant is very clean"}
{"text":"Great wings! Very quick service and relaxing atmosphere, a nice little wing joint with a long history and good reputation"}
{"text":"I can't resist half-price wing night so I found myself at Duff's on a Tuesday night.  I enjoyed the fried zucchini stick starter more than what I would imagine.  It was light battered and still had the crunchy freshness of the veg.    We ordered a pound of the bold bbq and the medium flavoured wings.  I still find that I prefer naked wings than the battered kind.  Maybe I just don't love carbs as much as the next person.  Service was fast, attentive, and friendly.  Couldn't ask for more on that front.  Till another Tuesday Duff's!"}
{"text":"Duff's is... well Duff's... not much you can say about a chicken and wings joint.  Their wings are a good size.  Their beer selection adequate. The wing sauces are generally tasty although the Armageddon sauce gives up flavor to try to burn your face off.  I like hot.. I love really hot that has flavor.  Unfortunately armageddon isn't it.  Mix the Armageddon with honey-garlic and we're in business (and that's what I frequently do :)  They also have a hot honey-garlic that is pretty nice.  Their fries are kinda meh. I prefer a larger crispier fry (like those from Toby's), but some like soggy straw-sized fries.  Just not me."}
{"text":"these wings aren't better than the ones from buffalo but they're the best in the city of toronto.  the long waits are definitely worth it.  this is a great place to go after a jays game."}
{"text":"The wings are much bigger here, however SO SAUCY. I found the celery sticks are just...bleh. I would rather them give us fries instead. It's really depending on how you feel, whether you prefer to pay extra for fries or stick to the included celery sticks. Their sauces are blue cheese or garlic dill. I tried both and prefer garlic dill by far. Not sure if this has won a place in my heart...I guess only time will tell. This location doesn't seem to be as busy during their Tuesday wing night special, so I didn't need to worry about waiting. Might be busier when it gets warmer, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment.  Food wasn't great, I had fish and chips, the rest had wings.  Had to pay extra for blue cheese dip.  Was offered malt vinegar and to try super hot sauce, never came.  Just not worth it, too expensive and not tasty at all."}
{"text":"Perfectly delicious medium Wings with just the right amount of heat. Flavourful with no runny nose after each bite.  I'm a hot wing guy but too many place get it all wrong by either lathering on the sauce or pumping up the tabasco.  Duff's got it just right in my opinion."}
{"text":"I always come here with the BF to get my wing fix and I am REALLY into wings. Duff's doesn't beat out Morty's in Waterloo (0.79/ wing on M & Th and they're HUGEE, no boasting at all) but it'll do when I'm in Toronto.  Wing special #1 comes with Lrg fries, 20 wings and a small pitcher of soft drink, comes to 33.05 ex. tip. It's not cheap and I think the reason why I come here is because I don't need to wait until I'm rolling on the ground from being hungry...*cough* St. Louis Bar *cough*  Celery comes out so quick with a side of either Blue Cheese or Dill Sauce and I swear, I would lick the little container clean if it was socially acceptable in public.  I'm a big fan of their fries because they always bring them fresh, hot, crispy outside, soft inside. As for wing sauces, they have nowhere near as many as St. Louis but at least I have every wing covered in sauce (note: medium is not hot whatsoever if you can eat Siraicha sauce)   Went with the honey garlic and medium and I definitely liked the honey garlic better because the medium was over fried and I liked the chicken skin so I was a bit disappointed  If you're looking for the same price paid for wings, I would suggest the Wheat Sheaf at King and Bathurst Streets."}
{"text":"Well, I'm seriously underwhelmed.  It's not that the wings were bad -- it's just that the hype of \"the best in the city\" means they have a lot to live up to.  Couple that with their own hype machine of  \"our medium is VERY HOT\", the running competition of who can eat the most, etc, and really, I expect something better than a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.  What I got is a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.  Juicy meat, sure, but way too much sauce* left the wings soggy.  I want some crispness to my wings.  Were they tasty?  Sure.  Are they worth over a buck a wing?  I'm not so sure.  Factor in their overpriced crap-domestic beer and mediocre fries and I'm left with little reason to go out of my way to visit the place.  Anyway, on to specifics:  I call a huuuuuge BS on their heat claims.  If I had known how run of the mill their \"Hot\" was, I would have instead ordered \"Superhot\" or \"Death\".  As a consumer, I find that misleading and disappointing.     I've been a hot aficionado since I was ten years old.  I feel more pain biting into a jalapeno (3500-8000 Scoville) than I did eating ten of their \"hot\"... a jalapeno is practically a fruit!  I didn't even have to blow my nose or clear my throat, nor did I touch my beer until after the meal.  Listen, I get it, marketing is king... but c'mon.  At least try to back it up!    I'm a bit sad to do it, but Duff's clocks in at an underachieving 2 stars.  Not only have I experienced better, I've also experienced hotter.  *  I am surely wrong, but I'd swear their \"hot\" sauce is Frank's Extra Hot mixed with butter.  It was that generic."}
{"text":"It was dry,not juicy and over cooked. But it was cheap bill. So I guess okay. But I won't go again."}
{"text":"The wings and calamari was okay with an okay price to split with friends. The service was nice too, though there wasn't enough meat on the wings so it didn't live up to my expectation in good wings."}
{"text":"Duff's has become a recent favourite post-rock-climbing meal after a few hours on the wall working up an appetite. My go-to order is always the medium hot wings made extra saucy and some wedges to soak up all that sauce (I love my sauce). If I'm feeling extra nippy I'll get a pint as well but more times than not the wings and wedges are more than enough for me. The sauce is just the right amount of heat and vinegar that reminds me of Frank's Hot Sauce. Admittedly after finishing the wings my tongue feels like sandpaper so you've been warned! All worth it though! The wedges are lightly seasoned and always crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  My friend who I always go with has celiac disease so she (legitimately) can't eat gluten. Duff's has a designated fryer for those who want to enjoy the wings without risking cross-contamination. Just make sure you mention it to your waiter. I've had my wings fried in that fryer (we ordered 2 lbs and shared it) and they taste exactly the same as the ones made with the regular fryer.   Service is nice and attentive. It does get busy on the weekends but I've only had to wait maybe 5 minutes for a seat on a Saturday/Friday night.   Parking is found on the street and there's a green P a walking distance away if the streets are full. I've never had trouble finding street parking."}
{"text":"Not sure what is especial about this place with so many positive remarks. I was there once and I found everything very mediocre and nothing crazy."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this gem for SEVEN years, and it is as good as it once was. These wings are delicious as I remember. I had the medium and the smoky BBQ, both were satisfying. When they say that mild is hot and medium is hot, they're not kidding. One day I'd like to try Armageddon...which you need to sign a waiver for. Enjoy."}
{"text":"best wings in the city, probably. cool atmosphere and they will serve boneless tenders in buffalo sauce, my favourite. potato wedges are decent-- not great, but a good accompaniment."}
{"text":"As with the downtown location...wings are consistantly large...I love the spicy BBQ and just wish they would deliver lol...great wings I always get take out as i like to eat them alone so I chow down like. Savage in peace...lol everyone I've taken to duffs always become a fan for life...the \"go to spot\" for wings if your in the north end"}
{"text":"I know people who swear by Duff's wings, and they're not wrong.  Duff wings are some of the best wings I've had in the city.  Not the best priced wings, mind you, but I always find myself deliciously satisfied as I throw that last bone into the white buckets.  They've got your usual variety of flavours, as well as a series of super hot sauces.  Whenever someone orders one of the hottest two flavours (they have names like Volcano and Hell, or something equally fitting) an alarm goes off.  I'm not sure if destroying my gastrointestinal tract is worth the satisfying sound of a siren, but hey, whatever floats yer boat.  Sure, Duff's sells other things.  They've got BLTs and other standard pubbish fare, but if you're coming into Duff's it's for one of two reasons.  1) You really want wings.  2) You're being dragged in by someone who really wants wings."}
{"text":"We got medium hot and it was hot. They've got these signs everywhere and the waitresses wear t-shirts explaining the system. Frankly, I found it annoying. Why not just call it like it is instead of wasting space explaining? Medium hot = hot? Just freaking call it hot and then you don't need to explain it. Oh well. Guess they're stuck with it now that they've printed everything.  Still, the wings were good, the explanation was accurate, and I found a smokiness to the heat that made them unique to other wings. Also, they had a good beer list including Mill Street, Beau's and Creemore. Better than St Louis which seems to exclusively sell crappy Molson products.  We sat at the bar and the bartenders were VERY NICE, checked in with us a lot and never made us wait. Good times.  Popular place, if you go at a prime time on a weekend expect that you may have to wait for seats, the turnover is fast though.  They get props for showing NFL playoffs on a Saturday night in Canada. A lot of places would show hockey just because we're in Canada and not give other sports a chance."}
{"text":"I see the reviews say the wings are dry... but on the contrary. They're not as saucy as I thought they'd be, but to me the wings taste as if David (one of the chefs working at the back) had marinated them for at least a week. They're fried (but not oily) and quite large for size. The only thing I don't like is how a serving of wings does NOT come with a side order of fries. I usually order a thing of fries anyways to split with Steph because they're the perfect pair; a bowl of crispy, golden fries that have a smooth texture to satisfy the potato lover in each of us."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating at Duff's for awhile now. Seen tons of great reviews and rated number one in wings. But I was really disappointed.  First the wings were pretty expensive. I didn't mind paying a high price for the best wings in the city but I personally didn't like them much. If you like your wings extremely saucy then you'll love Duff's but for me it was just too much.  Seeing I didn't like the wings and how pricey they were  I can't give this place a good review."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years....since High School actually.  Every time i go it's like heaven LOL i always get the hot and honey Garlic wings.  What makes this place so good is that the skin is cripsy and full of flavour.  There are other joints that bread their chicken so you're eating all breading and no meat.  This place is all about the crispy skin and juicy meat............ok I'mgoing to Duff's now lol"}
{"text":"I have been going to Duff's for over 10 years now.  Mostly the one on Bayview but i have been to this location at least 5 times.  Duff's is my fav wing place still and i have tried many other places."}

{"text":"I understand it gets busy for the Tuesday special, but that doesn't mean customers deserve bad food/service. I was rushed to order although the wings came quick. I would not recommend the dry wings as it was totally bland and lacked the \"lemon pepper\" flavour. Moreover, it was over fried... They also forgot to serve us our celery sticks until we reminded them. Not sure if I would come back as there are plenty of restaurants on the same street."}
{"text":"I've tried most wing places in Toronto and we keep coming back to Duff's again and again.  They have got the sauces down to a perfect science and are 99% consistent, that is why people keep coming back. I love the slightly sour, hot and salty taste and the owners treat us like family! Have been coming here for seven years. Some people may not prefer the hint of sour taste but that is just a matter of personal preference, no reason to give Duffs a 1 star, like the completely unfair review from Joanne Z.  Maybe she should have gone for the Honey or Hot Honey In my experience, many people of descent prefer a less sour taste. In my opinion, Duffs has the best wings in Toronto."}
{"text":"We came here for Wings night on Tuesday after work and it wasn't packed yet by the time we arrived around 630ish..It slowly filled up..  The prices were decent, $7.75 for 1lb of wings, the wings are bigger in size in comparison to St. Louis. We ordered fried pickles, jalepenos, sweet potato fries and approximately 5 lbs of wings, 2 pitcher of beer. The bill all came up to around $130 amongst 4 girls which was decent. None of us dared to try \"Death\" or Armageddon as the Wall of Pain indicated how many each individual ate...pretty funny!  The food, service and ambience is a solid 3.5 stars not yet hitting a 4**, the downfalls are probably street parking as it's a busy area and the washroom which was down a set of stairs...didn't take any stars off that..  All in all, a place I will come back"}
{"text":"I've been going to Duff's for over 10 years, though much of it was at the Bayview location.  I don't recognize any of the staff at the College street location, unlike the original location but that's OK.  The wings are consistent as are the multi-level of sauces.  For anyone who has never been to Duff's, even if you think you can handle spicy hotness, beware of Death and Armaggedon - it will not only kill your tastebuds, you'll be living in the bathroom shortly after putting the wing on your tongue.    The ambience is definitely a bit more sport bar-like so be prepared to jump out of your skin when the Leafs score if your eyes aren't glued to the many TVs.  A warning that they are pretty high up so prepare also for possible neck strain.    Duff's consistency:  check!  Yummy and pretty large wings: check!  Good service:  check!  Not the cheapest place for wings - head there on Tuesdays for a bit of a cheaper deal and/or don't show up on a game night if you are looking to have a conversation with anyone at your table unless you like a cheerful din.  A great occasional indulgence!"}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Great size on the wings, celery sticks with dip but no carrots?  Not much to say about this place.  Nothing special and nothing terrible."}
{"text":"Warning: Beginning of Rant --  Seriously? This is why I had to wait for 30 minutes on Tuesday? Their wings are honestly not that good... especially if you've ever had All-Star Wings (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/all-star-wings-and-ribs-markham), pretty overpriced and that stupid bell and alarm have got to go!! Great someone has enough soft mushy balls to have a few spicy wings, I don't need to know every 30 seconds that someone has ordered them!  The only reason they get the second star is for the service which was pretty good and quick.  But overall it's overpriced, small wings with the same old flavours, and long wait times!  /End Rant"}
{"text":"maybe it's not an option.. but if you have a car; the original in AMHERST is a lot better..  This place (college st) literally has ZERO ambiance.  The wings are good, some of the better wings in the city.  When a father takes 2 kids to have wings and the bill is always around $50..  it's TOO EXPENSIVE.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Omg I love those wings so much! I usually go for mild as they're a lot crispier that medium or hot. The sides are ok too but I really come here for the wings. Beware that even medium wings are pretty hot. I never dined in only take out I'm so I can't comment on the service."}
{"text":"Best wings in the city by far...dare I say as good or better as the Buffalo location.   Interesting fact on the poutine, it's made with veggie gravy.  My wife is a veggie so this works out very well...and she loved it."}
{"text":"I was meeting up with a couple of friends who lived in Toronto and we needed some place to go eat so we decided on this particular spot. We stopped by a Tuesday afternoon, so the wait was practically nothing to get a table. The first thing I noticed when I entered was that there some flies buzzing around the place so that didn't exactly leave the greatest impression.   We were seated and then ordered food. The prices for food here is very reasonable. I didn't want to try the hot wings so I instead opted for the more neutral wings, the Hot Honey Garlic and the Spicy BBQ. The wings were pretty good, and very saucy, but this was a week after I tried Buffalo Wild Wings and I couldn't help but feel as if these wings couldn't compare. The fries were forgettable and the beer wasn't anything special, and I'm coming from America where the beer is supposedly watered down.   Overall, I thought the food was good, prices reasonable for wings, but not exactly something I'd come back to in the future."}
{"text":"I was craving chicken wings so I went for dinner at Duff's and had a great experience!! I typically go to the location on College but had been here once before a long while ago.  The restaurant was packed but service was still very good. We weren't sitting long before our order was taken.  I tried the hot honey garlic wings and they were delicious. I hadn't had them before. I tried one of the mild wings but I found they tasted overwhelmingly like butter, so I'm going to stick to different flavours. All of the food came out at the exact temperature it should have."}
{"text":"Best wings period.  My daughter loves the chicken fingers. A++"}
{"text":"Duff's has the best wings I have tasted in Toronto yet. My family started with mozzarella stick and zucchini sticks appetizers. They came out nice and warm with fried just right. If you like your wings hot, I recommend the death. This flavor has just the right amount of hotness. Lemon Pepper wings is another good choice. The lemon & pepper seasoned dry rub is fried just crispy enough that you will enjoy every bite. The ambience is what you would expect from a wing spot. The only think that I was not to happy was that they don't offer free refills on bottled water, juice or soda. I have a family of five with kids, so refills add up. So if you don't mind tap water with your wings, then this is the place you !"}
{"text":"Summer wing tradition.   My friends and I have made this place our yearly go to place during the summer. When summer comes around we have to go to duffs, I don't know how it started it just happened.   They have many different flavours from the traditional mild, medium, hot, and bbq. But the flavours that I consistently get is the honey garlic, and the spicy honey garlic. Normally I am not a honey garlic wing fan b/c theres either too much sauce or its just too sweet. But these wings were very well done the sauce was just right. The spicy honey garlic sauce is even better b/c its got a little kick to them.  Now I have a couple of downfalls to this place.  The first being that I only like the wings and nothing else. The fries reminded me of fries that you cook at home, onion rings weren't that much better and I have had a few other things on the menu and they weren't that good.    The second had to do with the size of the wings. The size of the wings were small, so small that the first batch that me and my friends ordered was 100 wings. You would think that 100 wings would satisfy 6 people, thats basically almost 16 wings a person. NO, it didn't, so we ordered another 50 wings just to be satisfied. And it's not like me and my friends are fat, well with the exception of one, haha, but it was pretty sad that we had to order that many wings to be satisfied.   I may dislike this place b/c of the size of the wings and that the other ites aren't the greatest buts its that honey garlic sauce that will keep me coming back every summer.  Items to definetly get  - honey garlic wings - spicy honey garlic wings"}
{"text":"I'm from Buffalo, there is a on going battle between Duffs and The Anchor Bar on who invented the chicken wing and who has the best. We left Buffalo 18 yrs ago and went to p.a. then to Nashville ( great place) the wings were awful in both both places. Believe me I'm glad there is a Duff's here."}
{"text":"What's better than a Chicken Wing Night? Nothing. You have a great atmosphere, Crispy Wings, Spicy Sauces, and fun apps!   Duffs and specifically Duffs on Bayview is the only place that I will go to for Wings. I've been here so many times and always have the best experience.   I'm always greeted with smiles and a great table. I always start off with the Blazin Onions; Spicy beer battered onion petals, served with ranch dip. I've had other apps there too but to be honest they're all very average and taste like deep fry. The Blazin Onions taste great.   For Wings, I've had the Regular and the Bone-less. If you want a mess-free evening then go for the boneless. Duff's saucy fingers are deep fried chicken fingers, smothered in any wing sauce served with fries and my favourite dip (dill).   What I usually go for is 2 pounds, the medium and the hot honey garlic. The Medium is spicy and the medium hot is very spicy so know your limits. I love the tanginess of the wing sauce and it goes great with the dill dipping sauce. The hot honey garlic is another favourite, it has a little kick to it but there's some sweetness from the honey. I love that the wings are massive and they are fried to perfection.   This place is the BEST. Hands Down!   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"Very very bad service.  Four wait staff hanging out and not taking order.  Waiting for a while and gave up.  Left store without ordering and nobody seemed to care. Now I know what segregation in the old south might have felt like.  I was looking forward to duffs as I'd been there before in Buffalo and enjoyed it.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I came to Duff's based on their reputation of having world famous Buffalo wings, having been to a different location of this franchise over half a decade ago.  If my memory serves me correctly, I enjoyed my experiences at Duff's all those years ago.    My most recent visit to Duff's falls in line with past visits.  The wings were really crispy but maybe a tad too dry on their own. Their hot sauces were top notch though, and made up for any dryness.  Solid spot for wings and beer!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Duff's. the service is good, TVs are a good size and the wings are great.  Tried their wings:  Buffalo Death hot: so hot it burned my mouth I barely finished 1 lb. does it taste better than super hot tho? No the taste is okay but its just extremely hot like crazy. I wouldn't order this again but if you can handle extreme heat try it.  Buffalo super hot: really tasty and for me they were hot. I really enjoyed these.   Salt and pepper: some of the best salt and pepper wings I've had. Nice and crispy. So good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Decent wings. Their hot isn't hot but I suppose they are appeasing the mass population.   3/5 *"}
{"text":"The honey garlic wings are really yummy. The drinks are expensive and not free refills like other restaurants.  This restaurant is very similar to Quaker steak and lube in the US.  Quaker has more spicy levels but does not have honey garlic and their drinks are free refills.  Expect to pay more on drinks than wings."}
{"text":"Pretty straight ahead wings - nice to be in a specialized place that is definitely no frills.  A bit pricey, though, for what it is - worth a try at least once,,,"}
{"text":"My hubster & I have searched high and low for good wings and beer.  He used work with his construction crew in the area and all the guys there spoke highly of Duffs, thus we tried it shortly thereafter.  He enjoys the hot flavours and I like honey garlic-  on tuesday nights they have 1/2 price wings with the purchase of a drink- so we'd always go for a pitcher of beer and 10 wings each.  Love ittttt.  But be prepared to wait in the queue for seating!   Some of my freinds who are the pickiest eaters I know have also made this place their must go to.   So the clientele keeps on expanding.  I prefer the leaside location to the downtown location- which is too noisey and pretentious.  Leaside location, has something very warm and friendly about it.    I live a further away than i used to from Duffs now, but this past weekend ordered it with some old freinds and it tasted like 'home'.  memories.  tasty and true."}
{"text":"Was a little underwhelmed by what is supposed to be one of the best wings places in the city. Don't get me wrong, the wings weren't bad by any means, but they definitely weren't spectacular either. Of course, it is very much based on personal preference, and I prefer dry rub Louisiana-style wings to the saucy kind on offer here.   The prices, around $10 per dozen, are in line with other joints and there were some reasonable meal deals as well.  Curiously enough, Hooters continues to lead my tastebuds in my Toronto wing quest."}
{"text":"Time to let yelp in on a little secret...as a rule I'm not a wing girl, I've eaten them but I tend to bypass them when they are on the menu. However, when I read that Duff's has been considered one of the best wing places in the city, and at a reasonable cost, I had to make an exception and I'm glad I did.  My fellow yelper and I checked this place out this afternoon and aside from the few uncalled for comments by people passing by, it was a nice afternoon..  The celery is crunchy...this is a big thing for me, soggy celery an automatic 2 stars! Only problem is that it wasn't enough and was served way before the wings. The dill dip served with it was delicious.   My friend and I shared a 20-wing dish, going the \"mild\" route of honey garlic and BBQ. The wings are definitely covered in your chosen sauce and there is a fair amount of meat on each wing. So it's very clear, they know what they are doing in the wing department.  I ordered a side of wedges and they were good as well. Perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.   So why not five stars? I suppose that's the non-wing girl taking off that one star. I'd love to have had the option of boneless wings with the same choice of sauces.  However, for a clean, decently priced, experienced wing joint in the heart of the city, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Hmmm what to say about Duff's.  Wings wings wings.  They're large and meaty and have fries that compliment their saucy wings well.  Nothing overly special but there is a good balance in price and quality.  Staff is always nice and attentive and have never had a bad experience here due to the staff or food."}
{"text":"Mediocre, dry and chewy on the inside and more skin than meat! I went to the Duff's on college 2 years ago and thought it was pretty good, so I visited this location expecting the same. It was a huge disappointment. Not even \"good.\" The wings were  incredibly overcooked and dry. And there was more crusty skin on the wings than actual meat. And this was on an early Saturday - not cheap Tuesdays. Add to that a dismal and pricey beer menu, the lack of ANY carrot sticks (just celery, folks - couldn't fork out the extra 20 cents for carrots) and it's just a waste of time.  I could barely choke down my first dry, chewy wing so I asked for a fresh batch - which also came in about 5 minutes. The drumettes were more moist, but the wings themselves remained dry and unappealing. I think the wings are precooked and tossed back into the fryer at the last minute. The wings came out way too fast for them to be cooked fresh. The two guys I went with were happy with their wings, but most men aren't that picky when it comes to fried meat and beer. The only good thing was the sweet potato fries, but the dipping sauce was gross (and I normally love chipotle mayo).  I'm starting to really wonder about diners in this city. Is this the best you expect? This is not a 5 star experience. The wings are drenched in sauce, there's no choice on how to get them done (breaded, plain, skinless, grilled,baked or fried). These are just FRIED, skin on, dry, horrible wings - leave your choices and expectations at the door. The wings at Philthy McNasty's are better - and I hate that place! I'm going to stop using Yelp if I keep having disappointing experiences at places with such high ratings."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with any of the wings I tried. The buffalo sauce was very salty. We had:  Spicy BBQ  Medium Hot buffalo Mild buffalo Honey garlic One death wing  The honey garlic was the groups favorite while no one liked the mild, they were very dry. The death wing was pretty hot but it didn't have a nice flavor. I wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"We are regulars here for 2 reasons - awesome wings and service!  Wings are delicious and if you're not into wings, there's plenty of other yummy things to choose from.  Staff are incredibly friendly, outgoing and attentive.  Very spacious layout at the College Street location (as opposed to Bayview location, which we find cramped)."}
{"text":"Meh. Ok spot. Server was indifferent (walking up and down the centre aisle by the front, never a smile on her face), atmosphere was lacking (Leaf game was on but they kept the sounds of some very average music playing), beer was domestic and the wings were good enough. Was no better than any other place for wings and beer, that's for sure. Probably won't go back, especially with so many choices in the neibourhood."}
{"text":"Just fair for us...which was disappointing as we were told how good it was. Had gone to The Anchor Bar in Buffalo earlier in the week and wanted to compare it.   The anchor was much better actually. Prob should have tried the duff in buffalo but ran out of time. Anyway, wings fair, beer overpriced. Was surprised that refills for soft drinks, etc were charged full price again when got the bill. No one told us as we got refills.  Slow service to boot."}
{"text":"The wings are fine but don't ask for extra sauce unless you want to pay $1.50 extra for it.  Just ridiculous. On $60 worth of wings they charge extra for sauce."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian now, but back in my hey day we used to do the Tuesday night special at the Bayview shop.  Best wings in the city by far, they are the saucy kind (as opposed to the dry st. louis type).   If you are into wings, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I'm not really a fan of chicken wings so I did not have any. My family enjoyed them though. I was pleased to find a healthy choice on the menu that was decent. I went with the grilled chicken burger and goat cheese/strawberry side salad. It was better than I expected.  Service was friendly and quick, despite the restaurant and patio being comfortably full. The restaurant was clean.  This would not be in my regular rotation, but it was alright and I'm sure that we will be back again."}
{"text":"A hot day & chicken wings go well together the way that peanut butter & jelly do.   I used to go to the Duff's location in Buffalo, but had not checked out the locations in Toronto since this place branched out. Emily B. and I had lunch here on Sunday afternoon while soaking the sun on this very hot day. I love fried pickles so when I saw it on the menu, I had to order it. They were delish ! We also ordered 20 wings - 1/2 Honey Garlic and 1/2 BBQ flavored. The latter was 'meh'; I prefer spice to my BBQ. Honey Garlic was sweet and yummy. My mum makes the world's best chicken wings so I have come to realize that these little bones with meat are quite overpriced when you go out. That being said ... Duff's charges the going rate for chicken wings in Toronto so I can't say that this place is too expensive. Service was pretty good; we were the only people on the patio and our server made it a point to come out and check on us. I was chugging water like no tomorrow and she was able to keep pace.   Good for: lunch, dinner, groups"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I have no idea how this place has less than 5 stars. This is truly the best wing joint I've ever been to and it's the only place I'll continually go back to.  I always get the same thing- naked wings with mild medium sauce on the side (less messy that way and I just prefer dipping my wings) with the dill sauce. My boyfriend almost always gets the crispy chicken sandwich with honey garlic dressing, and sometimes we share a side of strawberry goat cheese salad. I've come here 20+ times in the past year or two and the food has ALWAYS been good. Not once have either of us ever had a problem with our orders or with the service for that matter. I only have good things to say about this place and I'm truly confused as to how it even has reviews below 4 stars. The restaurant is clean, the service is great (fast and friendly), and the food is consistently good. Beats out St. Louis, All Stars (ew), Wild Wing, Wingporium, and all the other popular wing joints by far."}
{"text":"This place is for wing lovers. I've been eating at Duffs for years, since the original location opened on Bayview. I've tried all 3 locations in GTA and quality is the same. I always order the superhot and I also enjoy the hothoneygarlic and just regular honey garlic. I think they are the best wings in the city. That being said, I'm not a fan of breaded wings or weird flavours like ones at All Star. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is not the duffs I used to know.  Unfortunately duffs doesn't know whether it's a restaurant or a mortuary.  Forget about trying to watch a game here, whether it's cheering or getting a vantage point at a television, it's not happening.  At one point during the night we were approached by the manager asking us to be quite after we were laughing.  You want to have a good time with friends over some good food? Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"$41.25 for 20 wings, fries, and a pitcher of beer.  This works out to about $54.00 after tax and tip.  Just starting off, you know that Duff's is not cheap.  Even if we pretend that $20.00 dollars were for the pitcher of beer, you're still looking at $34.00 for some fries, and wings.  On one hand, you get celery and some dipping sauce (either dill, or blue cheese.)  On the other hand - you only get three pieces of celery.  All things being equal, celery is not really a loss leader.  You'd think they could have afforded to toss out, perhaps 4, or even 5, pieces.  But no, three.  That alone wouldn't be enough for a 2-star review.  What really let me down was when I asked about the Bold BBQ sauce.  Now, Duff's is not a place with dozens of difference sauces.  I think they had about 12.  Most of them were spices (medium, medum-hot, hot, hot-hot, really-hot, and some \"crazy hot\" things.)    I wasn't feeling the spice, but I didn't want a sweet Kraft-like BBQ sauce.  I had hoped the bold would be similar to a hickory smoke.  When I asked what it was like I was met with a few stumbling answers, and finally, \"there's not whisky in it.\"  Which, you know, is interesting and all - but not really descriptive.  I took a risk and went with it.  It was delicious.  The Bold BBQ wings are a great flavour, and go really well with the large bowl of fries you get with the combo.    Unfortunately, the wings are smaller than the last time I was there.  I'm sure this is universal, across the board, in order to keep costs consistent, they need to make the food portions smaller.  But, I don't view $54.00 as a cheap meal, even when shared with another person.    The wings were tasty - but no better, nor any worse, than what you'd find at most wing joins.  The prices are not delightful, but they are pretty much what you'd expect these days.  Unfortunately, it was the lack of knowledge about the flavours that really let me down."}
{"text":"All I wanted was some wings. I arrived before the kitchen is supposed to close at 10:20 and they turned me away, it was just me and one other friend. I could see fresh wings coming out but they couldn't be bothered to serve two more customers. Basically ruining the start of our night, the staff is rude and they treated us like trash not wanting our business. They had the nerve to offer us beer when we clearly said we came for wings."}
{"text":"Best wings!!! Have tried wings in many places and this is as good as it gets for me and my wing buddies. We frequent this place a lot, especially on Thursdays, and it's a great hangout. You can watch the game, eat great food, and socialize. Perfect after a work day! I have never gone above mild (which is already spicy for me ... I know!) But one of my friends ordered the Armageddon (yeah so macho) and he was crying LOL! The wings are big, juicy and meaty, but don't come with fries (separate order). One friend in particular always orders their cheeseburger and loves it."}
{"text":"Cardboard chicken wings, tiny with barely any meat on them. Made a huge mistake by ordering grilled cheese sandwich. Sliced Wonder bread with processed cheddar cheese and for that they charge $8. Cheap frozen french fries and potato wedges fried in old smelly oil. Very loud if full. Lots of TV's. Push-tap faucet in the washroom, for a eat-with-your-hands place not such a good idea."}
{"text":"I came here on New Year's Day for dinner and thankfully it wasn't too busy.  My boyfriend and I shared a sweet potato poutine and it tasted average. Little did I know, it was going to be the star of the meal. I got the honey garlic wings and although the sauce was good, the wings were really bad. The wings were clearly burnt and hard and they weren't able to disguise it by covering it with sauce.  The service is the only thing saving this restaurant from me giving it two stars. I really don't know what's so famous about their wings."}
{"text":"For a recovering wingophiliac like me, this place is the worst discovery EVER!  What can I say, the wings are far and away the best I have  had and what is more they have potato wedges  (thick potato pieces, breaded, spiced, deep fried, and served with sour cream) - a rare treat - on the menu.    Back to the wings...They come in a variety of flavours: barbecue, honey-garlic, plain, mild, medium, hot, and then five alarm wings.  If someone dares to go for these wings the whole staff brings them to the table and rings a variety of firebells, it's pretty hilarious.  And no I've never tried them.  Medium is good enough for me and I am a spice lover."}
{"text":"I don't understand how a restaurant like this can serve  chicken wings without  Carrots and just celery ? .  Who serves ICEBERG LETTUCE in Toronto? .I  will stick with the menu.. ORDER the  Special  Wings and French fries and pitcher of  beer for 2 or more ..The medium hot wings were delicious and not soggy.. MEDIUM Hot  wings were perfect and frankly not hot enough.   I say pass on the  expensive  iceberg salads. Try the coleslaw instead.   Gets very crowded on a Saturday so come early for evening...I give the wings a  5 star and give service and salads a  3 star...What? NO dinner plates?  Amazing...What?  3 people and only plates for 2 ?  Grab  the plates from the next table and enjoy your wings.. Do not rely on waiter service. that is average  .I do not recommend this place for children because its pub food and gets very crowded.. My visit was the Bayview location. They need to improve their salads  that are mediocre at best.  Had the Greek Salad...."}
{"text":"I'd pick Archibalds over this wing joint any day.   The wings are a bit over done for my likings and the price on Tuesdays aren't spectacular if you're looking to save a buck. The service was decent but I probably won't return. There was a hair that looped from one celery stick to another.  The only thing I really enjoyed about my meal was the bleu cheese dipping sauce. Now that was some good stuff."}
{"text":"The original Duffs what more is there to say. I love the Duff's college and this ones just as good although its inconvenient for me because Im never in this area but if I was I would be here.  Duffs makes the perfect chicken wings. Huge wings with taste spicy vinegary sauce. The sauce gets all over your fingers and your face when you eat the wings and if thats not how wings are supposed to be then I don't know anything. I always get my wings medium hot but I tried one of my dads hot wings and there wasn't much of a difference between the flavours.   Unlike that disgrace of a chicken winger the crown and dragon (flash back from the horrible meal) at Duffs you leave full and don't have to try and find a McDonalds afterwards. The fries are great and I love to dip them in the dill sauce that comes with the celery that I never eat.   Still owned by the original owner and he's still around her was working while I was there this is probably why this place is still so great. Service is superb and although the place is super small it actually can seat quiet a few people. Anyone who complains knows nothing about chicken wings and should head over to pizza pizza and get some of those wings or whatever they try and pass off as wings. Duffs makes the best wings in the city, they just can't be beat and I think I should try to find a better place because I know I'll just leave disappointed.  I will be back her if Im in this area and if not the college street location is always convent for me when I' downtown.   Duffs you're doing chicken wings right in Toronto, congratulations!"}
{"text":"I came here after going to Escape Zone. College street was crazy busy and after walking through walls of smokers outside a lot of different restaurants we decided to go to Duffs. The restaurant was pretty dead just us and a few other customers and there looked to only be one waitress who was managing her tables well.  I ordered the Blazin onion and 10 medium hot wings. The onion was great and the seasoning was tastey. The wings were perfect the way wings should be spicy, saucy and vinegary I dont know how people can stand eating sweet flavoured wings, if the wing isnt saucy and vinegary im not eating it. Theyre not over priced theyre about the same price as other wing joints. The wings are huge and super filling.  I will definitely be back when im in the area for wings."}
{"text":"Mmmm...wings. Having a craving for wings and knowing there's a Duff's nearby seemed to be a coincidence, or maybe not.... Time for this reviewer to stop reminiscing (and drooling) and get on with it.  Now I'm sure you just read that and are wondering, why 3 stars? Let me tell you: the salt content of these delectable chicken limbs makes me shudder. While I ordered hot honey garlic which were delicious- awesome sauce flavour idea BTW- my dining buddy's medium (come on, who doesn't swap a wing to try out what the others around them are eating?) were a flood of salt; heat, sure, but salt first and foremost. Other than that, no issues with the wing sauce- medium is medium. Wings are a nice size too. Draft beer is nicely kept.  There are better and worse servers; sitting at the bar was an experience watching the serving staff and the constant lineup at the door."}
{"text":"I live in NY, my cousin brought me here and these were by far the best wings I've ever had."}
{"text":"Hands down, THE BEST chicken wings anywhere!   I've been going to Duff's since I was little. I'm not that old, but I would say it's been about 10 years now, pretty much since they opened their doors. My dad taught me the importance of a great chicken wing by taking me here. Over the years, he's had to reduce the heat of his wings, where as I have been able to increase mine. I'm not to high up there on the hot scale, but Duff's hot scale is not a normal scale. They aren't lying when they say that their mild is hot. I eat the mild medium and love ever second of it. I like the flats, and they always try to do their best to give me more of those, but they can't guarantee it.   The wings are HUGE and are crispy - just the way they should be, none of that fleshy s*it here. A single order has I think about 10 wings, and they come with celery sticks and dip. I always suggest getting an order of fries to cool your mouth.   I love the atmosphere, it's so welcoming and the fact that it's a family biz adds a great touch. Duff's has opened a location on College Street and it's just as great! This location is a lot larger in comparison to the original.   Tuesday is cheap night, and it's well worth it - and it's well worth the wait, regardless of what day of the week it is. Trust me when I say this - there is always a line on Fridays and during the play offs....so go early.   This is truly the ONLY play I eat wings...and this is coming from a picky eater."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today and got a table on the patio.  We sat there for at least 10 minutes waiting for service.  Alas, we were ignored.  Yes, it was during the Taste of Little Italy but there were three servers on the patio.  And yes, they were busy but none of them even acknowledged us.  We tried to get their attention to no avail.  We eventually left and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wings were dry. Sauce sour. Wings small. No carrots. Not cheap. Got ripped off. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I would recommend Duff's Famous Wings!   This Duff's location was very clean and service was excellent! We were eagerly greeted by a server, who checked on us frequently through out our visit. There was not one time that I had to look up more than once before being noticed.   We ordered a special combination, which was 20 wings, small pitcher of beer (3 glasses), and potato wedges which was $34.50. Comparatively it is cheaper than other highly rated wing places in Toronto (with booze). While there was not a huge variety of wing flavors, they seem to do what the offer right. We got the medium and bbq. Both were adequately sauced, with a convenient bucket to hold all the bones.   We would definitely go back. Plus, there is street parking for $2.25 per hour, which for the city is decent. Worth the trip. Also, the patio (currently closed because of snow, looks promising for the summer)."}
{"text":"The wings here were fried up pretty nicely. Crispy,  delicious and well prepared.  They offer a limited variety of wing flavours,  focusing on heat itself. Not a bad thing at all - when they say \"hot\", they mean it. So, you won't be disappointed.   The bar offers a decent range of beers and spirits. Being a bourbon fan, I was delighted to find several different varieties there. Good on them.    The atmosphere is very casual, but not too overly jovial.  It is pretty classy.    Well worth going if you're in the area. Yes, they do have take out."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes after we were seated for anyone to approach the table. No one ever did. Only a few tables were occupied, and there seemed to be plenty of wait staff, so I don't know what the problem was.   Sadly, I can't speak to the quality of the food, and never will; I won't be returning.   We walked a couple minutes down the street to Wild Wing instead, where we were attended to promptly."}
{"text":"I really want to know WHO can down those Armageddon flavoured wings???!!! I had a single TINY nibble and tears immediately welled up in my eyes -- and I have a VERY high tolerance for heat (even by Asian standards).  Then I look over to their wall and there are people who have eaten more than 40 of them.  If I ever meet one of those people, I will bow down to them because I am not worthy (like... literally).  I had to pack the rest home because my whole system was on fire.  The next day, I rinsed the wings thoroughly and cooked them in instant noodles.  The soup turned into a pool of FIRE.  I have never felt as defeated as I have by those chicken wings.  I went back again and ordered the Superhot wings (number three on the heat ranking):  they were much more tolerable and very tasty.  The wings were very juicy and the amount of battery coating was perfect -- saucy but not soggy.  The next I go back, I will order the Death flavour; I think I'll be able to handle it."}
{"text":"This wings are alright and affordable.  Great atmosphere.  However was expecting more flavours for a restaurant that specializes in wings.  Their flavours are very basic and can be found at any restaurants that serve wings like mild, medium hot, BBQ, honey garlic, salt and pepper.  They need to be more adventures and play around with some sauces even as a special."}
{"text":"Good wings.  Unfortunately I can't eat them as often as I'd like, but my friends and I head there once a month or so.  I prefer the honey garlic, my friends spicy BBQ or plain.    A couple of tips:  the small pitchers aren't that big, so go easy on the ice or pass on it altogether.  If you order fries or onion rings, ask for them well done - otherwise they might be disappointingly undercooked.  And only take out on Super Bowl Sunday!  Can get pretty busy on Weekend evenings or sports nights - be ready to wait a while."}
{"text":"Came here for our 1 month wedding anniversary before my night shift. The hostesses and waitresses were nice and quick service! We came in at 6pm, so I guess before the rush of customers at 6:30 pm to 8pm. Perhaps the quick service was because they wanted us out the door? Anyways, the food came quickly.   We ordered fried calamari which came with dijon dip. The fried batter was not too thick, crispy, fresh to order, and not overly greasy. Tasty app. Next we ordered the 20 Famous wings with two flavours. We got Medium Hot and Hot Honey Garlic. When the wings came out, they were nice and crispy. However as we dug into the rest of the wings, the medium hot wings didn't hold up while the hot honey garlic mostly held up its crispiness. I'm not the biggest fan of wings  but this place can tout a good amount of meat to wing, the sauces we had were tasty, and the side celery sticks with blue cheese and dill dip were a nice compliment. Suffice to say, not \"amazing and the best wings of Toronto\" like most people would say, but a good place for good wings. I think it's important to note that I'm not that into wings so take my review with a  grain of salt."}
{"text":"The original location still serves up the best chicken wings in the city. Fantastic no-nonsense chicken wing spot. Don't expect an overwhelmingly complicated list of flavours that don't make any sense. Wings are crispy, juicy and well-sized, and covered in your choice of buffalo-style wing sauces, as well as BBQ and honey garlic options. Their fries are a good balance between thin and crispy, and the dill sauce is fantastic. Not the most inexpensive, but the definitely worthy of the prices for the extra quality. If you swing by on Tuesdays they run a special when you order a beverage with your wings."}

{"text":"On a whim we were driving down Dufferin contemplating eating before an event wehad to attend in three hours. My mind was thinking fast and remembered I've always seen Duff's wings by the La Fitness and never went there. So I said it out loud and le boyfriend was like SURE! (Oddly enough he is extremely picky about his wings however for the fact that he has never been there he was intrigued)  Fast forward, he got the special $31.95 - 2lbs of wings (medium and buffalo sauce on the side), large fries and a small pitcher of fountain beverage. I just got a 1lb of hot and honey. They asked if we wanted carrots OR celery, blue cheese OR dill. Obviously celery and dill was the choice we took.   The celery came first and le boyfriend doesn't like dips, however he wanted to try it out. He said it was delicious (took me by surprise). The wings and fries came out. They were nicely sized, temperature wise hot and CRISPY! So far so good. Mine, the hot and honey were very scrumptious =) No complaints there. For le boyfriend, he killed his 2lbs and stated that this may be a top contender for wing nights.   The service was great! Even though it wasn't busy they were fully staffed and our waitress checked up on us at the right times. The atmosphere while walking in was so welcoming as well. Something I don't usually experience at wing places so it basically \"... had me at hello\" haha.    One downfall - NOT unlimited refills -- however that's why they have the options: Glass / Small Pitcher (about two glasses) / Large Pitcher.   I definitely will be recommending this establishment to anyone looking for a wing night!"}
{"text":"Great wings, great onion rings, cold beer. Simple but done not quite right so many other places. Respect the hotness warnings for the wings. Hot honey garlic is a revelation."}
{"text":"It's not bad, its a nice environment but honestly the wings don't compare to Crown and Dragon....but it's not bad....  I bought some armagedon for my friends and...they're HOT...I have to say those wings were good for people who like it HOT.....the other wings were alright.  I do have the say the service is GREAT, the waitresses there were fantastic....  Go on a game night, hang out with some friends it's not too pricey..."}
{"text":"The wings are OK. They are larger than their competitors, but the ones i got seemed pretty dry and tasteless.  A little more expensive, but the wings are bigger.  Place was kinda of small, and the owner and manager was beside us in the bar so felt like he was staring at us.  Not much for flavor selection compared to the competitors.  Good wings, but i was expecting more flavor."}
{"text":"Wings are usually very very good, I love the buffalo sauce, the dill dipping sauce and their fries are awesome. One of my favourite places for wings. The atmosphere is good, it's fairly new, clean and modern. Service is generally pretty good, I've never had any issues, and prices are at par with most wing places."}
{"text":"Excellent wings... We tried the hot and medium-hot and these are by far some of the best wings  I've ever had.  The service was good, ambience was as expected.  This place is a definite must when I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"I was searching frantically for a place with air conditioning and enough to seat 8 people on a busy Friday night. And we came to find this place. Great service. Though the house beer we ordered was a little flat. They have good price on the chicken wings and those were fantastic. An average place, however with excellent service."}
{"text":"Bayview location downtown always does them a 5 star job as the wings are perfectly crispy and delicious but the north location does a good 4 star job;don't know what difference is but it is ;otherwise all other food is and service is as good . On tap beers very good . I live in the north and will remain a loyal Customer since they opened and of the downtown and buffalo orignals back many decades"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for some finger food. We came in and the environment was really nice and cozy. There weren't that many guests in the restaurant at the time. It was nice and quiet.  Service was really fast. We ordered calamari, mozzo sticks and hot honey garlic wings. Food was delicious, especially the mozzo sticks and wings. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Best wings I have try in the city. I love how saucy the wings are and how fast service is as well. The wings has a lot of meat in them and are perfectly cook. Every time I crave wings, I always come here."}
{"text":"Wow! I've got to say I am seriously impressed by Duffs, both in good and bad ways. First the positive: wings are huge, juicy and smothered with sauce...trully thru the mud style. Sauces are flavourful and I love their creamy dill dip, if you think that's for celery only try dipping wings in it as well. The onion rings were also top notch, crispy and not too oily, batter is deliciously sweet and savory at the same time. Poppers were good too, creamy and crunchy at the same time...what a treat!   Now the negative: Selection of beer is pittiful unless you are an avid Molson Fan. Onion rings on their own are $8.25 that's about 1000% profit margin right there, and wings are $12/lb sans fries, so really more  like $16 with small fries. If you come for Tuesday's special that combo will still be $12 plus you have to purchase a beverage. Somewhat pricey if you ask me, since there are places where you can get same quality wings, fries and a pint for only $10.   Overall I am not ready to overpay for cheap beer and fried food, the unhealthiness of a pub night is weighing heavily on my conscience as it is without the added budget concern."}
{"text":"Hot Honey Garlic, Medium Hot.  Best wings on earth, end of story."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!   The service are very fast, the staff are so accommodating.  I've been going to this place for a few years now and I've never gotten a bad service.  The wings are amazing as always!"}
{"text":"I had a good experience at Duff's.  I was there on Tuesday night (which is their wing night - 10 wings for $7.25 with the purchase of a drink which is roughly 3 dollars cheaper than the regular price).  I ordered the wings medium.  They were hotter than most medium sauces I have had but they were large and meaty and came cooked well done/crispy, just as I had requested.  I also ordered the zucchini appetizer (breaded and deep fried zucchini with a dill sauce) which was decent but rather oily).  My dining companion ordered the Caesar chicken wrap which came with uninspired fries.    I would go back for the wings."}
{"text":"You know you are boring new parents when sending the baby to the MIL, ordering wings and renting a movie makes for a fabulous Valentines day.  Unfortunately our night was only marred by the choice of wings.  Shoulda gone to our old standby of Bistro on Ave (a St Louis joint).  We got take out so I can't comment on anything other than the food. The wings themselves are suspiciously large, like how big was that chicken?  That may appeal to some but I'm a fan of the non-drumstick and like to work a bit for the wing meat. Got the honey garlic which was a waste of time but luckily the side of hot honey garlic sauce I ordered saved the day.  The medium is really Tabasco-y if you are into that.  The fries were mundane and the large order was excessive for two. (The dogs got a great breakfast the next day).   But now I can say I've had Duff's wings.  Not really my thing.  BTW the movie was District 9.  Now THAT was good."}
{"text":"Have been at the ufc event . The only problem I had the the table wasn't cleaned unless we ask and wait . But the food was great for a bar main screen quality was very poor . Definitely will try it again ."}
{"text":"With the deteriorating quality of St. Louis, Duff's will be having an easier time staying as the top Wings place in Toronto. The only sad part is that you will not find much more than wings and beer at this location, but within that domain, you will have choices. The seating area can also use some major improvement as it resembles a cafeteria.   Take it for what it is...a great wings joint."}
{"text":"A classic as it seems, and you get what you expect. Good, rapidly served and basic but well executed fried chicken wings and drumstick, and the vibes is that of chian restaurant (not that of a fast Popeye's food place)... as they say medium hot is very hot!!! if it's your first time, better you chose a lower level of hotness, than the general medium you would pick in a regular thai place for example..."}
{"text":"This past weekend my wife and I were in the Bayview and Eglinton area and decided to head on over to Duff's for some artery clogging cuisine.  We had heard quite a bit about this place in the past but had never visited.  As soon as we opened the door to the pub we were greeted by a genuinely friendly hostess who promptly ushered us in from outdoors and had us seated.  After glancing at the menu we quickly decided on 2 lbs of wings with half being \"Medium Authentic Buffalo Sauce\" and the other half \"Honey Garlic\".  We also ordered a side of potato wedges.  The food came out surprisingly fast, within 5 - 10 minutes!  It was so quick that I asked the waitress \"That fast eh?\", to which she responded \"At this time the fryers are going non stop so its just a matter of tossing it in whatever sauce the customer wants.\"  The Buffalo Wings (since that's all anyone cares about):  The two essential components of authentic Buffalo wings were satisfied, they were deep-fried and cooked without any kind of breading. The sauce was well balanced and the skin was crisp and not soggy.  As soon as your teeth penetrated the skin they were greeted by meat that was moist and tender.  Overall a nice spot with friendly staff and a very relaxed atmosphere. 4 Stars"}
{"text":"4 stars cuz I wanted more but not too much more! Got one pound but not full enough. Didn't want to order 2 pounds since it'll be double the price for about 15 wings.. Other than that, amaazing flavour and the fries were great too!!"}
{"text":"BBQ Wings and sweet potato fries were crispy and packed with flavor!!!  Great food and friendly servers"}
{"text":"I have been a lifelong fan of wings and am always on the search to find the best.  I have tried some of the best around North America, but had never tried Duff's.  I have been told time and time again that Duff's in Buffalo and Toronto have the best wings out there.  So on a recent trip to Toronto, my wife and I stopped into the Duff's location on Bayview.  These are now the wings by which I will measure all others.  Yup, they lived up to the hype and now sit at #1 on my list of \"best wings\"!  We popped in mid-day on a Monday and found the place to not be crowded at all.  This place is downtown, so you either have to park on the street at a meter or find a local parking garage.  We found a number of metered spots available on the street right in front of the restaurant.  Upon entering the small restaurant we saw that you could sit either inside or outside.  We opted for an indoor table since it was looking like it was about to rain outside and ordered their #4 combo.  The #4 gets you 20 wings, with fries and a large pitcher of beer for around $35.  You can split the sauce on the wing order, so we got 10 Hot and 10 Super Hot.  We ate the Hot first and those wings were amazing.  The sauce was the best I have ever tasted.  Perfect amount of heat and great flavor.  The Super Hot wings were very good as well with a noticeable jump on the heat scale, but not too hot.  Enough to make you sweat, but not to the point where your tongue is burning.  We preferred the Hot over the Super Hot due to the great flavor that came through in the Hot wings.  The fries were also very good that came with the meal.  We actually contemplated ordering another order of the hot wings since they were so good, but declined since we were already pretty full.  Duff's gets five stars for serving up what I would consider \"the best wings I have ever had\"!"}
{"text":"Duff's Famous Wings is a chicken stop located on a busy strip of businesses along College St. in Little Italy. The mood here is partly a 'sports bar' vibe mixed with the atmosphere of a sit-down restaurant.  Wings are the first reason anyone would walk through the front doors, and the folks in the kitchen do not disappoint. These wings are meaty, generously sized, and seasoned very well. I can't think of many other places in the city that compare in terms of quality.  Staff are attentive and pleasant, but when it's busier (during sports events, etc.) you might expect visits to your table to be fewer and farther between. All in all, this is a nice place to unwind by your lonesome or with a group of friends. For the wings alone, try 'em out at least once."}
{"text":"If there was a 4.5 star option, that's what I would have given it. By far the best wings in Toronto, but lacks in consistency. Usually the sauce to wings ratio is pretty good, but every so often they will just be drenched. The beer selection is indeed wanting.  The only place I've found that rivals Duff's wings are Anchor bar, which also originates in Buffalo (and is said to be the creator of the buffalo wing).  They start you off with 3 small pieces of celery/person and your choice of blue cheese or dill sauce. IMO blue cheese is the way to go. Something about their celery - it is somehow the greatest celery I've ever had, every single time.  Wings - authentic buffalo wings (indeed the original Duff's hails from Buffalo), and so far the only ones of its kind in Toronto. There are a number of your 50+ flavour breaded wings around the city, but nothing compares to your simple deep fried wing with that spicy red/orange sauce.  Fries - Great in their own right. Shoestring, unsalted, and not easily comparable to any other fries I can think of.  The honey garlic sauce is extremely sweet and sticky - I guess that's good if you like honey garlic!   You'll find some people rate other wing joints in Toronto better than Duff's, but if you're looking for Buffalo wings, this is THE [only] place for them in Toronto!  Now with 3 locations across the GTA (Uptown, downtown, and Thornhill Woods), wait times are not what they used to be."}
{"text":"After a long day of studying I was excited to try Duffs for the first time and I was severely let down. The servers were polite and service was quick, otherwise I would give this location 1 star. The wings were over cooked, dry, small, and the sauce was very ordinary. If I wanted crappy wings I would have cooked at home. I always want to support small businesses over the likes of Wild Wings but Wild Wings is much better. For $50 for 2 pounds a small pitcher and large fries, the beer was the best part and the next was the celery.   All in all, if this is the food on a Saturday night I can't believe food will be any better .. ever. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Not sure what's the big fuss about this place..  I checked it out last night and I wasn't that impressed. The place was very loud and it was hard to carry a conversation. Service was OK, but not more then that. I've ordered \"Medium wings\" and \"Hot Honey garlic wings\" both were OK but a bit dry in my opinion.  I may go there again if I am in the area but definitely won't go out of my way to dine there. Oh, and one more thing.. if you are a person with disabilities take into consideration that the washroom is in the basement and the only way to get there is by stairs.."}
{"text":"Came back to find out they don't have loganberry juice anymore! :(. But I did find that I enjoyed the hot bbq more than the hot honey, which I usually get at other wing joints. The hot honey here is a bit spicier, bt the hot bbq is balanced with the sweetness from the bbq sauce. Got sweet potato fries that were too soft to be considered fried, should've gotten onion rings."}
{"text":"wings be mad good.  since the hipsters that run this website pointed out that my review was short, I will expand:  the beer was cold, they have a bunch of tv's, i would definitely bang 3/5 of the waitresses that work here. Fries were on point and so were the onion rings, the dips were mad good too, and dey was chilled just at the right temperature, perfect for dipping wings into which really contrasts the steaming hot and sometimes very spicy wing (am i seriously writing a review about this? ) .   Duff's has been the go-to spot for wings in Toronto forever and is known as the gold standard of wings in this city, do not be confused by the other wing places (st louis, other places), there is a real reason why duff's has a lineup at each of their 2 locations each and every location for easily the last 20 years."}
{"text":"The service here has always been great. The wings are worth the drive from Mississauga.  The sampler app plate is a great starter while waiting for delicious wings.  I have had all the flavours almost except suicide lol and none have disappointed me"}
{"text":"For a place that's been rated as a top T.O wing place, I was very underwhelmed with Duff's. Let's start off with flavour options. Unlike places like All Stars or St. Louis, there are under 20 options (mostly gradations of Hot, Sweet, and Dry Lemon/Salt rubs).  The service was friendly and fast, so that's a plus. The wings themselves were standard size, definitely not big or juicy by any standard. My biggest issue is with the hot sauce. They claim that medium is hot, and hot is very hot. Nothing could be further from the truth. I actually ordered their Armageddon sauce to see if that was any better, but at $3ish, that just tasted of more vinegar and hot peppers. In general the sauces lacked complexity. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Came to watch a baseball game, but loved the wings! Great food and great service. I wasn't a fan of the decor - it was more fast-food joint than bar. I also wasn't a big fan of the Sampler (I found the mozarella sticks, jalapeno hoppers, etc a bit too breaded). But the wings were amazing!"}
{"text":"I know I am not a Wing person!   It always amazed/annoyed my friends when I start telling them how fattening chicken wings are! (the skin, the dark meat really adds up the fat content, cholestrol level and calories) and now you deep fried them in oil! Then coated in sauce composed of a vinegar-based cayenne pepper hot sauce and butter.  (http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate/nutrition-calories/food/generic/buffalo-wings-1-medium-sized-wing/)  I don't really mind if they at least tasted good! The Duff's Famous Wings we have the other night was so dried.. like chewing on jerkys.  But I love Cayenne Pepper Hot Sauce/Todasco!! I can eat anything that has hot sauce on it.. but nothing can save these poor dried chicken wings....  Luckily, this is not my main meal just a little snack with a pint of beer.. The pint of beer and good companion made of for the food.  I don't mind coming back trying the Death and Armageddon wings, but I really don't think I can stomach the whole order, not because of the heat but the wings itself!"}
{"text":"Duff's is good. Not great, but good. Once in a while I get a Duff's craving (Yes, I get different wing cravings regularly), and then I fill it, and then I can go back to my enormous wings from Sneak's and my occasional trip to All Star's and then, life is great.  Duff's essentially has two different kinds of wings -- honey garlic and the \"hot\" ones, which you can get in different levels of hotness. I do love how saucy they are, and all the fixin's -- particularly the yummy blue cheese dip for the celery and carrots that try to make you feel less guilty about eating several chickens in one sitting.   The problem I have with their wing sauce is that it's probably about 85% vinegar. After about 10 wings (and trust me, I usually go far beyond 10), your mouth starts to burn. By the end of the meal, it's as though you've had 5 bags of sour keys and then gargled with lemon juice. Ow.  And the fries are just eh. Haven't tried the potato wedges but the fries are nothing to brag about, and their beer selection is the same. The biggest problem with this location of Duff's is that I could easily go down the street to Sneaky Dee's and have their wings instead (and on Mondays they are cheap with beer!) and save all the skin in my mouth. But sometimes you need a change, and Duff's is a good choice if you need to stray. The College St. location is more modern looking but the Bayview one reminds me of the good parts of high school, so they both have redeeming qualities.  So, once in a while, Duff's rules. And make sure that \"once in a while\" is far away from peak hours -- at any sort of normal dinner time, on any given day, this location is usually filled with frat boys and awkward first dates."}
{"text":"Oh Duff's... What would I do with my life without you and your ginormous delicious wings?   Yes, Duff's wings are MASSIVE. And despite what anyone else says they have the best wings in the city. I lived next to the Crown and Dragon for 2 years and although their wings are good too the wings at Duff's are over and beyond better. The sauces are great, even their dry wings are excellent. And you know how they serve vegetable sticks on the side? The blue cheese dip has chunks (CHUNKS!) of blue cheese in them.   My tummy always leaves happy. Have been going to this location for years and the place seems to just get better and better.   PS: this location gets busy and it is small. Prepare to wait."}
{"text":"Simply the best wings in town! Size, how they are cooked, the coating and the sauce perfect."}
{"text":"One of my favourite wing places in the GTA! It feels super authentic when compared to other restaurants and their clean environment does them a solid 5 star job. The location is very accessible and the traffic is good because of their quality food. The staff is great and communicative, they never fail to cater to you. There were plenty of times where the staff openly engaged with me to make sure I am content with the food and the service. Not just coming up to you and asking \"How's everything?\" but more like reading my facials expressions to see how I'm truly feeling and going above and beyond to make sure my stomach is truly satisfied. They literally took my plate of calamari and brought me a new one because I gave off a salty look when they asked me if I liked it or not (my facial expressions are pretty low key so I was surprised they even noticed).  Their menu is not too long but long enough for you to be reading it over and over again trying to decide WHICH OF THESE DELICIOUS SOUNDING FLAVOURS WILL HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE CONSUMED BY YOU. I recently stepped out of my comfort zone and tried one of their burgers and was not disappointed.   Great place to head down to if you are looking for a chill spot to watch the game and have a couple of beers. Just make sure you get some food in your stomach before you start drinking ;)."}
{"text":"The wings were pretty good, however I can't seem to understand why the buffalo locations seem to be much better? I also do not understand why there is a $10 price difference for 50 wings from Buffalo/Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been here once and it was apparently half price night. This resulted in sub-par service and sitting cheek to cheek with strangers. Wings were small, nothing special. Very jocky atmosphere with dim lighting and various games playing on flatscreens all over the room. You can do better."}
{"text":"Top notch service!  We ordered a pick up last night, and when I got to the restaurant almost everything was wrong. Once we'd figured out what had been missed, the manager put a rush on it in the kitchen and gave it to us on the house as an apology.  Total class! I would have been happy to pay for it, but their willingness to take responsibility for screwing up and fixing it so fast made a potentially shitty interaction absolutely pleasurable.  As always, the wings were awesome: large, juicy and well cooked! If I had to say something constructive about the company, it would be listing allergens on the site (I gave a 4-star review because it turns out I can't eat 90% of the menu). But even that's reaching a little."}
{"text":"I personally am a wings and beer and this Duffs location is an awesome place to get a pound of wings with some buds and catch a game or just to hang out!  The venue is clean and inviting (You can tell it's new-ish, or maybe recently renovated?) Servers are friendly. They serve some craft beers so that's a plus   Wings are a good size and you get your fill with a pound of wings. Wings don't come with fries as with other places but does come with veggies. But they are also light with the veggies though as well.  They also serve other things like poutine and onion rings. Flavors are there but you won't see a list of 100.  Pro tip: they got a Tuesday deal, I believe it's half-prices wings. Also, I believe there is underground parking at this location."}
{"text":"Wings wings wings!! Tasty wings at good prices. Casual and very friendly atmosphere where you feel like family. Not a wing fan? There are alternative options like a strawberry spinach salad which are also tasty - I enjoy that they give you the dressing on the side as I often find salads like this overdressed for my taste. I wouldn't come here as a destination for non wing meals, but if someone is in your party that doesn't like them they have options.   If you've got a hankering for wings and are in the neighborhood, Duff's is a great option!"}
{"text":"For the life of me, I cannot understand why some of the reviews rate this place lower. They must be staff of other wing joints who are afraid of losing customers to Duffs.  Friends and I have been to Duffs on numerous occasions and although their wing flavours are not as bountiful as say All Stars or Wild Wings, we come back here rather that going to one of those places. The wings are just better at Duffs...meatier & more flavourful.  Our party of 4 usually orders the following: 20 wings with a large pop & fries - 10 wings mild & 10 medium 20 wings and a pitcher of beer & sweet potato fries - 10 wings Spicey bbq and 10 hot (my selection)  Never have our wings been dry...just the opposite...they are coated in finger licking sauce.   We've also ordered the jalepeno poppers (a tad bland for my liking), salads and the bloomin' onion ( no comparison to the Outbacks onion).  This is a wing place...and they do it right. We go back at least twice a month. Great service, reasonably priced but more importantly...excellent wings.  Try it...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It is really hard to find a wing place that are not breaded, and taste really good. My friend and I ordered 4 lbs of wings, we can barely finish it because the wings are pretty big. We ordered 4 different flavours and they were all very delicious. Only one thing we regert doing is getting all 4 lbs in sauce, we should have done one in dry style. My order from favorites to least favorites (Honey Garlic, Medium, BBQ, Spicy Honey Garlic). They also serve amazing fries too, I enjoy my night there. I will definitely be back with my other friends.   Service: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Environment: 3/5  Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"Duff's has been on my hit list for a while now. It's always advertised as one of the best wings in the city on BlogTO and other sites. While I am by far not a wings connoisseur, I do crave it from time to time.   I arrived into the restaurant on a Thursday and there were a decent amount of people. We were brought to our table - the server was not particular the most friendly but it was adequate. We decided to order a pound of lemon pepper and a hot honey garlic wings (which comes with celery and dipping sauce - I LOVES THEIR DILL SAUCE!). Along with some large sweet potato fries.   It took about 10 minutes but we got our wings. My first impression was that the wings were not as large as I expected a place which calls it buffalo wings to be. The pound probably has 12 wings or so. The hot honey garlic was not very honey garlicky - it tasted almost like a medium at most places. I was disappointed by this flavour. The lemon pepper was better in my opinion - especially paired with their dill dipping sauce! It was nicely flavoured and I would have it again. The sweet potato fries were good as well but it's hard to screw that one up! It was definitely a large portion though for the fries.   Overall, was not impressed by the size of the wings - and hot honey garlic does not reflect the name. But the lemon pepper wings and the sweet potato fries were pretty good. I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.   2.5/5."}
{"text":"My friends brought me here a while back telling me they are the hottest wings in town (not literally) but in size and flavour. I decided to order honey hot. First time ever ordering that flavour anywhere, I usually go to \"all stars\" where they have crazier tastes to choose from. I decided on a single order and we shared some fries as a group. I found the wings to be a decent size and coated very well. I took mine normal and my friends sister took her's light on the sauce. I like how they were able to put in that type of request as everyone has different preferences.   I found the place to be pretty basic, not a lot of choice on their menu and for some reason packed with people. The service was great and I did enjoy myself while I was there, and although I was quite content and satisfied I wouldn't make a special trip from North York just to go here."}
{"text":"Blog.TO ranked this place as the #1 spot for wings in the city. Well they are not to far from being wrong. The wings were good, the atmosphere was cool, and the staff was friendly - what more can a wing lover expect.   Nevertheless, for a place that mainly focuses on wings, I would expect more flavour options."}
{"text":"After being introduced to true Buffalo-style wings on the Great International Chicken Wing Crawl of 2009 by sarah l., my tastes have shifted more than somewhat. The barbecue-style wings that permeate restaurants far and wide just don't do it for me now that I've had the Real Deal.  Duff's, though, I love. Pretty close to that Anchor Bar goodness without the hassle of driving or crossing the border. Duff's is awesome.  They boast that medium is hot, hot is very hot, etc., though I find the medium to be, well, medium. Very tasty and with a noticeable but not excessive amount of heat. I tried a bit of the Armageddon sauce on a fry, and it most definitely was hot, but nearly devoid of any other flavour. The wings are meaty, so a buck a wing doesn't feel like a ripoff.  Other than that... beer selection was OK (nothing amazing), service was good, and I have a higher opinion of the fries than some others here."}
{"text":"Terrible service, I went into the restaurant and sat there for 5 minutes, the restaurant only have 2 tables of customers, and no one serves us. I went to the bar ordered the wings. The wings was too hard too chew, I think it was overdone, not sure was it always done like that. Strongly not recommended."}
{"text":"Very nasty hotwings, which is their signature dish for crying out loud. Do not eat here. Even KFC has better chicken.   I really like very spicy food, so that wasn't the problem. The problem was that the sauce (we had medium hot & death) tasted like it was just made of ketchup, vinegar and hot peppers. They just as well can give you a bottle of Tabasco to drink. Both sauces tasted the same, but death seemed to have more hotness to it. That was the only difference.  Secondly the meat was dry, like it was cooked a few hours before or many minutes too long. Dude, how hard is it to cook a chicken wing?   My mother father and sister had different food, they didn't like it either.   I'd rather lick the street that returning here."}
{"text":"We were hitting 0/3 tonight. Entered the plaza looking to buy bread at Cobb's, arrived at 5:59 to a locked door. If your sign says you are open till 6, be OPENED TILL 6. We popped in next door to the Thai Express, tried to get the wheelchair under the 3 inch thick tables but it was too high, or the table too low. We had spotted a wing place just down the way and decided that Thai would be faster so in our disappointment we went to try something new.   We entered into a very crowded place and I believe the Manager was the one who seated us. The first great sign was that the wheelchair fit perfectly under the tables and my son was chest to table. Next we found a fully accessible washroom. Huge bonus marks if you have a kid in a wheelchair in tow. We placed an order of wings and asked for a pitcher of Soda Water (yes, they have that, check). Having a drink devoid of any sugar is hard. A large pitcher of Soda cost about the same as two little bottles of Perrier and there was quite a bit left over. I am pouring my son a glass of water and I see the Manager coming towards us with a BENDIE STRAW. I swear I just about hugged the guy. Do you have any idea how many restaurant managers I have spoken to about getting bendie straws in and still they don't bring them in (even though they think it's a good idea). Those straws are great for kids AND PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS!  The food was top notch. The wings were HUGE. The small fries and onion rings were anything but. I would have hated to see the large sizes. Wings, crispy and juicy and seasoned just right. Fries, pretty standard but awesome with Ketchup. The rings were crispy and a delight. All in all, a pretty outstanding meal"}
{"text":"Not sure when things went wrong with these guys as they were the best of the chain. But now the wings were tiny and over cooked.  The wide selection of sauces did taste good its just too bad about the quality of the wing itself."}
{"text":"Duff's is alright, but nothing special - another chain chicken wing place with lacklustre service, passable food, and a location in the middle of gentrified suburbia.  The wings are less bread-y than at All Star's, which could be a positive or negative depending on the way you like them. I've had friends get through an entire batch of Armageddon wings... the aftermath ain't pretty."}
{"text":"It's just another wing place like all the other ones.  Each person has their favourite and I've not made up my mind.  The clan likes to come here on Tuesdays.  You buy a drink and get a serving of wings for $8.  The place is fine for Tuesday - other nights are pretty expensive, as I find almost all the rest of the menu.  The drinks cost too much, and who wants to pay $5 for a small order of fries - literally one big potato deep fried or $8 for a large order. All in all, A-OK for Tuesdays but stay away on other days. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Filling. Incredibly filling. I ate 1lb of wings and a whole order of sweet potato fries a bit after noon and I was satisfied until the morning after! Now the order itself, I had 1lb of honey garlic wings and an order of sweet potato fries. The wings were drier than I would have liked; I definitely prefer All-Stars wings (-1). Our server also frequently checked up on us, more than any server at All-Stars ever would, but he sometimes checked on us from above. Now, I don't think anyone would know what I mean by this until they visit Duff's. I sat next to a little seperator wall, but because I was sitting down, the wall was above my head. Whenever our server checked on us, he would see us from over the seperator and it creeped me out because I never saw him coming. He did this 3x during my stay. Just come around the wall and ask us....it's literally 2 more steps to take to not creep your customers out (-1). As for the sweet potato fries, they tasted great! The portion was quite small however for $5+."}
{"text":"famous?...maybe... number 1 on blogto's best chicken wings in Toronto...maybe...  I had really high hopes eating here after becoming friends with someone who comes here on an almost weekly basis \"you gotta try it, you have to\" so I was in the area for a film premier and some time to kill so I figured hey why not.   the lengthy establishment is very dark on the inside, which is ok for some but to me It felt very moody from the moment I walked in, eh I'm here for the wings. had a seat at the bar and had a once over on the menu, I was fascinated with how much food options physically were on the menu, settled with my favorite started calamari, poutine and for the main event was some wings with a Greek wrap. the calamari was the best item I ordered, and ironically enough was the first item to come to the table. I'm not sure what they do to make that sauce for the calamari but DAMN good dipping sauce, told the waitress she should bottle it, that got a cute chuckle. the poutine was very bland, stock gravy, frozen fries(Cavendish I believe) the cheese was good though. before I was able to finish off the poutine and calamari, my Greek wrap came to the table, I was neutral with the wrap the sauce/dressing on the inside was a bit of a turn off to me, before I could finish that plate my hot wings showed up.   full disclosure: not the best wings in Toronto...I'd even go so far to say that these wings are very lackluster. not a lot of meat to these wings, I was way too excited for this, I was anticipating buffalo chicken wings which was not the case at all. the wing sauce was pretty hot and delicious though, this much I will give duffs credit.   the service is great, the drinks are strong and cold and other then the calamari, the food was not worth what was being charged at the end of the day.   parking is street side with a couple of pay for parking lots in a short walking distance. transit is the 506 college streetcar and the 511 Bathurst streetcar with a short walk along college.  famous?...maybe... number 1 on blogto's best chicken wings in Toronto...not a chance...sadly. overhyped and very much underwhelming in portions and flavor."}
{"text":"I can't say anything about the wings, but the burger was okay, while the jalapeno poppers were served with salsa, which seemed a bit odd to me (I've always had and would much prefer them with ranch). The service was okay, but we arrived towards the end of service, and I felt like we were getting shoo'd out by the end of our meal."}
{"text":"Every time I try to go or order take out from this location they're closed or closing ( two hours earlier than usual ). I also get a free order of extra sassy on the house. Even though they're good wings and fries, the service is enough to forget this place. How do you say you close at 1 and shut down at 11 can't even get to go? Crazy"}
