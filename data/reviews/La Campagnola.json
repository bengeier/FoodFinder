{"text":"I think the grand mother is cooking all the meals. The food is delicious, great family atmosphere in the restaurant. Good service and reasonably priced for the portions. A stable in LaSalle!"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite BYOW Italian in the \"city\"! Delicious homemade food and great service every single time."}
{"text":"The service is amazing here!! You're treated like family and it's true. They go above and beyond to make you happy. I have nothing bad to say about their service,  one of the best I've experienced! 
The food was nothing special. My gf and I ordered pasta and pizza. The pasta was bland and the pizza was cold. We've had better pasta and pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"This restaurant really offers an interesting menu with lots of delicious options for every taste. The service is top notch and I suggest you listen  closely to the options offered by your waiter as they will recommend the flavours of the moment. 

They have a wide selection of charcuterie and aged meats.  I had the deluxe charcuterie platter and let me tell you it was both  generous and refined. I regret that I came late as I had only a small appetite so I finished off with an aragula salad. However,  I will be back to try out their rack of lamb and veal scaloppine as my friends had it and made me taste these heavenly dishes. 

On a side note,  the low light ambiance is nice but the pictures had to be taken with flash which doesn't give them enough credit in the beautiful presentation of the plates."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've had, since like ever.

The service was great, nice decor and ambiance, and don't get me started on their AMAZING food.

I never imagined that I would compliment a restaurant's bread and butter, but here I am. We were lucky that day because we were served two kinds of butter for starters, the homemade basil and sun-dried tomato butter was the bomb. The cold cut platter was on the house, and the meat quality was exquisite.

Their portions are humongous, after a shared appetizer we were almost full. The fried calamari was sauteed in grilled red peppers and marinara sauce, and every bite was delectable.

I had the veal scaloppine with tomato sauce and angel-hair pasta, while my girlfriend chose the ravioli and ossobuco. My dish was spectacular, but nothing too exiting. Fresh homemade pasta with great seasoning.

That ossobuco and ravioli, on the other hand, was practically screaming \"eat me!\"  It is delicious, delectable, mouthwatering, tasty, delightful, gorgeous, lip smacking, yummy, wonderful in taste, texture, and aroma. I just cannot find enough adjectives to describe the scrumptiousness of the dish, the food speaks for itself.

The place is slightly pricey than I expected, but everything was prepared fresh and with finesse, definitely a hidden gem in Lasalle."}
{"text":"On a random Wedneaday evening, we found ourselves in the area, and wanted to find somewhere new to grab dinner. How did we do that you ask? With my trusty Yelp app of course! A quick search of the area revealed very few places to eat with high ratings but when I read the reviews of this restaurant, I was sure we had hit the jackpot!

We drove over, and were quickly seated. A quick look at the menu revealed a good selection of food but not as wide as I would have expected. Being a pasta lover (who stays away from it at all costs), I decided to splurge a little and go with a tortellini in rosé sauce while my better half went with a veal plate in congac sauce. We were brought some homemade bread which was....interesting I guess (I wasn't really a fan) alongside two type of butter. We were also then brought out a small slice of pizza each (compliments of the chef) which was a nice touch.

When our food came, everything looked great, but sadly the taste was simply not there... I had hoped for some out of this world Italian speciality pasta, but what I ended up getting was something I could have made at home. When I turned to my husbands veal plate, again, both him and I were disapponted at the lack of flavor in this plate.

Overall, the food was not bad per se but was simply not special and within a few bites, we we're sure that we would not return. I do have to say though that despite the food, the staff was very courteous and service was quick. However, considering the price of the menu items, we expected much more from this place. Unfortunately, this restaurant is a no-go for me.."}
{"text":"The BEST restaurant in Montreal hands down.

I can not emphasize this enough. You have to try Campagnola.

First of all, the service is excellent. Waiters are friendly and knowledgeable,. They describe their table d'hotes, fresh meat and fresh fishes with enthusiasm and passion. They are well trained. The Owner is there to always greet you at the door and he often comes around to each table with free samples of premium cheeses , homemade sausages or whatever fresh purchases they have made for the week.

But the amazing service is far eclipsed by the incredible food. Everything, and I mean EVERYTYING, is delicious. UI have had Pasta, Seafood casserole, Steak, Fish, Veal and almost all of their appetizers and I have been beyond impressed every time..

Must trys include:
Aranchini balls
Bruscetta
Stuffed Veal
Osso Bucco Raviloi
Seafood Pasta
Filet Mignon
Seafood Casserole

I have been to so many Italian restaurants in Montreal and nothing comes close to Campagnola. It is certainly the best Italian restaurant in Montreal but I am even willing to say it is the BEST restaurant in Montreal period.

One thing to note: the atmosphere , décor and location is quite modest, but I go there for the food and the service.

I have also been there for a wedding shower and engagement party (we're talking large groups) and the food was still hot and just as delicious as when we are just 2 on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I enjoyed every aspect of my supper , food was very good and service was great.

Definitely not my last visit!"}
{"text":"Not only is this the best BYOW in town, I think they're right up there at the top for Italian cuisine as well. Whether it's The fresh breads, capicoli, truffle veal, osso bucco ravioli or the seafood pasta you will not be disappointed, they're all to die for."}
{"text":"Really good Italian been got my bday and New Years and a bunch of other times. Can't go wrong with this place. It's usually busy so make a reservation :)"}
{"text":"Il faut y aller pour le steak! Aucun doute. J'ai déjà eu des déceptions en ce qui concerne les crevettes. Pour le steak, c'est le meilleur que j'ai goûté à Montréal, et de loin. Leur steak vieillit est tout simplement délicieux. Dino prend soin de sa clientèle et le service est excellent. Ça vaut le détour"}
{"text":"Good food. The cold meat was amazing. The pasta was cooked al dente just right. The steak was tender and the doness was perfect. Minus one star for the rather too dark decor."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this weekend. Food was quite literally perfect...osso bucco ravioli, seafood pasta, beef tartare, charcuterie plate were all perfect. service was a bit slow but nothing too serious...it was a totally full house after all. our server was so polite, funny and personable. prices are relatively cheap considering the food you get and it's a BYOW. I'll be back here again and again."}
{"text":"Have you ever recently had \"real\" tomatoes? Vous savez, celles qui ne goûtent pas le carton\"? Well, the farm that supplies this familiglia-owned business has just those perfect, sweet, tasty, vine-ripened red gems! In a simple dish with pepperoncini, basil, feta, balsamic vinager and only the best olive oil,  it was swoon worthy! 
Ce n'est pas pour rien que les famiglias italianas viennent célébrer ensemble, ici. Nourriture authentique et accueil chaleureux.
Mangea!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Very fresh Italian food. I tried that place about 3 months ago, so can't remember exactly what we ordered but I do remember that ever dish was spot on. It had been a while since I've had such a feel good \"home-cooked\" type of meal. Staff are super friendly & welcoming. Quite decent portions, was super full for the night. & finally, its a BYOB spot!"}
{"text":"Service here was exceptional, partly because my aunt knew the owner. We ate a whole lot and I won't be going through everything but overall it was not bad. Everything is made in house which is a great touch. 

The in house cured meats is delicious. I wouldn't recommend eating steak here, I would choose the pasta. Overall the food was not bad, I wouldn't go back though as it is really far west and nothing really wowed me. 

Keep Eating,
Angela"}
{"text":"No doubt about it: perfect! We came in December but being Christmas party season and not making a reservation we didn't get a table even though it was a Wednesday. Came tonight (Tuesday mid march), made a reservation but didn't need to there was plenty of place, nice n quiet. The service was perfect, the food was perfect, the price...well honestly a bit pricey but soooooooooooooo worth it (cannot stress that enough). Had the charcuterie platter to start was so f&*king fantastic: we asked and were told their meats are available for purchase per pound (just have to call in advance to order) and we definitely will be taking advantage of that (1lb each capicollo, smoked prosciutto, sopressata you will not find a better quality of these cold cuts anywhere else ever and i dare u to prove me wrong). We followed up with the 14oz filet mignon for two platter which comes with your choice of sides (we chose the linguine tomato sauce and fries with truffle salt) it was cooked to perfection wayyyy beyond the quality of any steakhouse i've been to (including queue de cheval, houton's, vargas and the keg among others). The fries with truffle salt were phenomenol and came with homemade mayo and ketchup both of which you will not find better. I was disappointed with the linguine tomato sauce but my bf liked it just fine. We finished off with their crème brulé and 2 café lattés: beautiful finish to a beautiful meal! Our waitress and the busboy were incredible and i hope they're always there when we go again. Will definitely be making this a twice per year treat, highly recommend this place : but make your reservation just in case!"}
{"text":"Une vraie tattoria italienne, c'est à dire qu'ils font tout maison: leur pâtes , leur saucisses, leur charcuteries,  pâtes à pizza. Un vrai délice.  Très belle terrasse et apportez votre vin en plus!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here forever. Carpaccio. Best I have ever had. BF loves the osso bucco ravioli..I love the sausage and rapini."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 8 years, and the quality of food has never changed.

The service is spectacular and the food..is beautiful.

Some of my favorites are below:
- Fluffly ricotta gnocchi in arabiata
- Veal scallopinni with pesto, tomatoes and bocconccini
- Homemade sausages
- Ceasar salad ( not rich but actually fresh)
- Sometimes, they have these amazing ravioli stuffed with ossobucco 

Basically, everything I have had so far is great. 

Don't get too full, because the desserts are made in house also- and they are heaven.

I hope this place never ever leaves me."}
{"text":"Un service extraordinaire avec une nourriture excellente. Je recommande ce restaurant sans aucun doute!"}
{"text":"Came here last Sunday for a private function and was very impressed with both the food and service. Very, very good. Really enjoyed our time here. Food was very good. Service was quick, friendly and efficient considering we were about 30 people. It really felt like home."}
{"text":"Superb food, atmosphere and service! Have been going there many years and it is one of the best family type restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"Group of 6 - Everything we ate was excellent.  Took the recommendations from Dino - meat and pasta dishes were all great. Service stellar. Save room for creme brulée.  New favourite Italian spot."}
{"text":"Reviewed this place a year ago. Went there last night, this is the last time I will review it.that's because it will become to popular.Had one of the best meals in a very long time.Shared A very good ceasar salad,she had pasta with shrimps that was out standing. I had one of their specials,veal with a side of pasta. This meal was as good as any you could get in Montreal. The staff are great,the whole experience was a treat."}
{"text":"Ok so let's talk about La Campagnola.

Obviously it scores major points because it's a BYOW. That's always appreciated when the check arrives.

The food is - as you can clearly tell by the reviews - AMAZING. The ingredients are high quality and fresh, they make a lot of their own recipes, and it shows.

For god's sake even the homemade bread and butter is finger licking good. 

I'm a fan of the veal, but tonight it was the mozzarella di bufala that stole the show.

The service is impeccable, and the fact that the waiters are all Italians adds a nice touch of authenticity. The decor is nice, the ambiance pleasant, honestly I would eat there every week.

I didn't give the restaurant 5 stars because I've been twice so far and on neither occasions there was Tiramisu available. 

A proper Italian meal has to end with Tiramisu and limoncello, everyone knows that.

Also, the place is always packed and very very loud. It's not bothersome enough that you won't have a fabulous time, but you may not have a voice the next day.

But your belly will be stuffed with incredible amazing deliciousness, so who cares.

Oh! I almost forgot the Canolis. The are very light and airy. Amongst the best in the city.

I will go back every chance I get."}
{"text":"I was there for a birthday party on February 21st and it was a great time. 
You have to BYOW (Bring Your Own Wine). 

Because we were a large group we had a semi-fixed menu. 3 appetizers and a choice from three main meal options. There was also dessert and coffee included as well.

The food was *amazing* and it started with the warm bread at the beginning. The appetizers we had were fantastic: Sausages, pizza, and a quality cold cut variety plate. We had already eaten a full meal just from the appetizers! My Husband & I both chose the veal with mushroom sauce and that came with delicious pasta on the side. Unfortunately, I don't know what the dessert was, but it was very good!

My neighbor chose the pasta duo meal choice and I heard it was 'bland'. The duo was penne with tomato sauce/cannelloni with cheese.

Everything was SUPER fresh and I would definitely love to go back! 
100% Return-worthy!"}
{"text":"This was the best meal I have had in a long time. We started with sausage bruscetta, arencini, and a chefs special. Oh, before you order they bring you fresh baked bread with slices of cappicol and two different flavoured butter. I had the vegetarian pizza with home made sausage. Excellent.  Too much for 1 person. The others ordered various veal scalopni plates. Everything was flavorful and plenty of food on everyone's plate."}
