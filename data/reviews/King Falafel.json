{"text":"One of the best shawarma in the city by far! This place def gets overlooked. No idea how places like college falafel outrank this place. That's a joke, it must be the location. Being all the way at eglinton and Bathurst makes this not the easiest place to get to. It's totally worth it though. Veal is used in the shawarma sandwich. Sauce is amazing and everything is wonderful."}
{"text":"They closed this place down due to putting a subway station...too bad they had amazing food."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for roughly 5 years. It's my favourite shawarma place period. My job has me all over the city so I've tried multiple places.  There hot sauce is home made. Can't get enough of it.  Medium heat tones of flavour. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Worst Service Ever!!! They mixed up my order. After I explained it was the wrong dish they argued with me and would not correct it. When I refused to take the wrong dish they told me to \"leave and never come back\" 
Worst Customer Service I've ever experienced!"}
{"text":"By far the worst falafel I've ever had. Shawarma wasn't better. Looking at their shawarma turning oven you'll see it's been traveling between fridge and oven for at least two weeks. What a waste of time even writing about this place. Shame"}
{"text":"Ugh.  Possibly the worst falafel sandwich I've ever had--the falafel was tasteless, the pita was sloppily rolled so it dripped all over, and the guy at the counter wasn't even wearing gloves.  (Does it say something about me that I was so hungry I ate it anyway?)  I should have skipped it."}
{"text":"A smattering of tables and chairs. Pink and grey walls. Derelict pictures of Morocco with the colours washed out from the sun. A glass door separates the main area from what seems like a party room. Whatever function it serves, it's closed off to customers, and I'm too hungry to ask. 

I order the first two things off of the menu, falafel sandwich and a shawarma sandwich. Spicy? Yes please. There are no toppings on display, no real choice of bread it seems. It's surprisingly refreshing to not have to worry about what should and should not be in, on, or around my sandwich. 

The falafel is fried up in front of me. The meat for the shawarma is carved up fresh. Everything good so far. I grab my sandwiches, make the payment and walk home. The falafel sandwich is up first. The pita bread has a pleasant crispness that gives way to a warm and fluffy texture. The sauce and the falafels are perfectly spiced. Every bite melts in my mouth. I try hard to slow down and enjoy it, but before I can even get my head around to how good this is, my hands are dripping with tahini sauce, my plate is empty, and I want more.

I move to the shawarma. The spices on the meat are slightly different than what I am used to, good different. The meat itself is moist and tender, but the sandwich could have used more tahini sauce. It's hard to judge it after the falafel sandwich. I just want more of their falafels. Why am I even eating this when I should be eating more of their falafels. 

The decor could do with some updating, but King Falafel is home to the unequivocal queen of falafels."}
{"text":"Our favourite place for falafel sandwiches even though they are very basic. Nothing fancy, just pita, falafel, lettuce, tomato and tahina sauce served hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Most definitely a 3 star establishment. Falafel balls came out crispy, hot and satisfying although they are lacking in flavor. I had to douse my plate with hot sauce (well to be fair, I would have done that anyway). 
I did love the warm pita bread and hummus that came with my plate and the salad was fresh.
 I wanted to try other things on the menu but after going here I agree with other reviewers on the state of the shawarma - it looked days old. Didn't want to touch it."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times now - finally tried the shawarma after having nice results with the Falafel and reading how good it is in other reviews... sorry to say it's not that great. I expected if off the spit however they have it pre-carved under the counter, place it on a plate and then zap it (for what seemed to be forever) in the microwave. The meat was so overcooked it was difficult to chew. Stick with the Falafel as it's made fresh to order."}
{"text":"Falafels!
What is the deal with these Middle Eastern joints which emphasizes the word 'Falafel,\" in their restaurant name, but once you walk in it's all shawarma?  

So I was grabbing lunch with three co-workers and we took the company vehicle which we parked just across the street, since our company car can park anywhere for free, we didn't pay any attention to the parking enforcement looking at us.  
Our lunch was restricted to a time limit, which is the only reason I didn't end up somewhere in the financial district for a pretentious plate of arugula.  
The restaurant name says falafel, so it would lead me to believe that upon entering, there would be a variety of different falafels to choose from.  But the fact of the matter is that all the falafels I was going to find are placed in this little tin tray made probably from a frozen batch yesterday.  In this case, there's lamb, chicken and beef to choose from, and it's not bad...but I got lured here because of the word FALAFEL.  
It's like if I were to go into Spring Rolls, I expect there to be a plethora of spring rolls to choose from--which of course there is--at spring rolls, because it's called spring rolls....not 'A Spring Roll (restaurant). 

I got the chicken shawarma AND some falafels, and I'm watching them shave my chicken from that giant pile of spinning meat to make sure that I was getting my money's worth (don't pretend you don't do it as well).  The process of putting my $12 lunch into the takeaway was going okay...until the man reached for my falafels.  He took them piece by piece and placed in tupperware, which confused me.  Then he walked the tuppperware opposite to where I was standing, and in front of my very eyes he placed my falafels into the MICROWAVE!  I was shocked, and I was speechless!  I cannot believe what has just occurred.  I have just paid $16 for partially microwaved food, is that even Halal??
TIM HORTINS WAS CLASSIER THAN THIS!!

He gave me my food and I gave him a look of disapproval, but the look could have been misinterpreted because I was in my Army uniform, and he was Middle Eastern.  But one thing was clear, and it was that I was displeased.  

There needs to be a brainstorming session by the Middle Eastern food association of people who cook halal food or something.  I don't know whether falafels only come in on kind, but reform is needed.  It's not some you go into a soup restaurant and they only have chicken noodle.

Worst $20 I ever spent!"}
{"text":"So sad to hear this place is closing down due to the Eglinton Crosstown construction (they basically bought the entire plaza and the corner shops in this area to build the subway entrances). Have yet to find a better falafel in the city... I love the way they spice theirs, it gives it so much flavour compared to all the ho-hum falafels most people are used to. My favourite thing to get is the falafel sandwich (sometimes I get just the falafels to add to my lunch salads.

The lovely lady who runs this shop now said their final day will be Dec 31 so if you want to try this spot go now!!"}
{"text":"This family business has been serving the Bathurst & Eglinton area for 35yrs now and has a very loyal local following.  The falafel is great, the lentil soup wonderful but my fav is the shwarma (spicy w/ a bit of taboli inside) I is to die for.  Have been going here as long as I can remember and everyone I have taken there has become a die hard fan.  They are Lebanese and Halal.  King Falafel is a local treasure and I look forward to another 35 yrs of eating there."}
{"text":"Super food.  Super price. 

Good place for awesome food.

I can keep going, but what's the point.  Just walk-in, grab a falafel and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I didn't find anything special about this place. It is certainly nothing to look at, and the food doesn't make up for what it lacks in ambience.  The prices are pretty standard for fast food middle eastern fare. I came in for shawarma and was surprised to see that they only offered veal shawarma.  It was also made behind a counter where I couldn't see what toppings were being used. Call me spoiled, but I'm used to a little more transparency in my shawarma joints. 

The shawarma seemed to have an Indian flare to it in terms of the seasoning. I liked the way it was stuffed (pita was split and stuffed like a pocket) and it was reasonably good, but not great. A fine choice if you're in the area but certainly not anything I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Family run place been going there for years same consistent great food and the home made sweets are awesome.

Falafels are some of the nest in town price unbeatable old restaurant bit clean staff and owner very nice 

Recommend"}
{"text":"The shwarma is perfect, the eggplant is unbelievably good. The tea is mediocre though."}
{"text":"While it doesn't get an \"A\" for atmosphere and it isn't the prettiest place, what you get is a great falafel for cheaper than you could find almost anywhere else in the city. A sandwich is 3.81+ tax. I always get the falafel plate (6.99). The falafels are always cooked perfectly. The sauce is amazing. You can't go wrong and if you don't like it you only spent 4 bucks.  Service is friendly but direct."}
{"text":"I grew up around the corner from King Falafel, I've been coming here for 20 years.  That's much more impressive if you know that I've been in California for the last 10 years, and I still go to King Falafel every time I'm in Toronto.  It's become a yearly pilgrimage.

I'd chalk that up to nostalgia, but every person I've introduced King Falafel to, including people who lived on New York falafels for a couple years, think this place is great.

The falafel balls are the perfect texture, the tahini sauce has great distribution in the pita, and the mix of chopped up vegetables is right on.  Make sure to order yours spicy for a nice kick in the mouth (it's not really that spicy, just a bit of a wake up).  As I'm writing this, I'm regretting not going every single day while I was in Toronto.

They've also got Shwarma, but I've never been able to order anything other than a falafel sandwich, spicy.  It's just so damend good.

But, heck, if my review doesn't make you think that this is a place worth going to, consider this:  Pretty much everything else that opens in this mini-mall, is dead and gone within a year or two.  King Falafel has stayed put for decades."}

{"text":"Located in a strip mall on Bathurst Street just south of Eglinton Avenue the place is simple in style and layout. The windows look onto Bathurst Street and they offer a few tables inside. Everything is made right there behind the counter. The falafel sandwiches are made with small round thick pitas that are stuffed with chopped tomatoes, lettuce, tahini sauce and yummy falafels made from chick peas and onions. These falafels are different from the ones you usually get in most downtown falafel shops where the pitas are larger and also much sloppier to eat. A definite must for anyone interested in a yummy falafel for lunch."}
{"text":"Got myself a small Falafel wrap for about $4 here.

Heard many great things about this place, and it seems to have been open for a really long time! The wrap was nice, but then again I'm not the biggest falafel fan. 

\"Why did you get a falafel wrap, then?\" you may ask.

Well, the reason behind that is that this place doesn't look that great outside and in. I was worried that the lack of traffic and proper tiling would mean that that chicken meat slowly rotating on the metal stick is a few days old at the least. 

I didn't want to spend the car ride doubling over, so I stayed safe with a falafel wrap, instead of the meat."}
