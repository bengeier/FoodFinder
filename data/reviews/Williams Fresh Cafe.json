{"text":"I stopped in at Williams Coffee Pub on a morning bike ride for a coffee and a bottle of water.  The coffee was fine, nothing to write home about, really what I wanted was the bottle water so this place hit the spot.  Upon entering there was lots of dog and cat information as it looked like some sort of pet information centre, cool, I love animals so this was fine.  I did find it weird that you had to go through like a baby gate in order to buy your coffee but then I realized it was a pet friendly cafe.  Awesome!  I was enjoying my surroundings, kind of bummed that there were no dogs to look at (it was early morning on a long weekend) then a couple brought in their cat, in a tote bag.  Hilarious!!  I am pretty educated with cats as I have a few myself and I was shocked at how happy this cat seemed in its bag at the cafe.  After the couple got their coffee they let the cat sit at their table and pet her.  So cute and soooo strange.  Back to the cafe review... the decor of the cafe was not memorable and it did seem to have breakfast and lunch on their menu.   I used their one bathroom and it was fine.  I guess this place is for people like me who come across it while spending time on the waterfront or for pet friendly families who want to bring their dogs or cats with them for coffee."}
{"text":"4.75 stars.    This is our stop prior to taking off from Pearson, always and it never disappoints.   Always fresh and tasty.  Need I say more??  Ok, I'll give that it's a bit pricey if you compare it to your local Timmies but that would be an unfair comparison.    Try the blt and sweet potato fries.  Itz nize...!"}
{"text":"Great place to meet friends and a great atmosphere,  but don't ask for something out of their menu, my wife asked for a \"misto\" and the girl at the counter stared at us like a deer in headlights and try to charge us for a late."}
{"text":"Nice Place to eat and good food! But nothing special more like a bistro in a shopping center."}
{"text":"Terrible over priced food. Ordered the house iced tea and it was practically water with a hint of sugar. The chicken quesadilla was cold and wasn't worth $6 as Taco Bell had better food that this place. That should be proof enough that you need to avoid this place like the plague. Oh, and internet sucked. Barely worked. What a joke of a \"cafe\""}
{"text":"Williams Coffee Pub - is a nice place to chill out and chat with friends or do work as they have Internet access.   I think they provide a service that really is missing at other coffee shops which is the convenience to sit, relax and just chat.  Overall the food is okay, I'm not a fan of their wraps, or sandwichs, but their coffees, milk shakes, hot chocolate and cakes of course are fairly good.  During peak the place is packed and there is no where to sit, most of the time theres like 5, 6 people doing their work - I'm guessing its a step up from the Library?  If your looking to sit around and chat after the movies, or want to hang out - this is the place to go .. but for dinner I would pass it up."}
{"text":"Good selection of food and very clean restaurant.  Very courteous staff.  Food is basic so not much to say about it. It was fresh and well prepared."}
{"text":"Services is bad, felt like I've been served a mean in a prison  Food are not fresh as is it say on the logo  Wish I've never came in"}
{"text":"Dont come here for a cup of coffee unless you like the taste of warm water n cream. From a guy that makes his own cup of joe with fresh ground coffee with a frenchpress."}
{"text":"Extremely rude service. The food is amazing. The customer service is absolutely the worst. I used to go here all the time, but stopped after they banned studying in the store. The funny part is the students that I me there stay all day and order food every few hours. It's not like we go there and treat it like a library. We order food. Banning their biggest customers was a stupid idea, at least in my opinion. The service is always slow. The owners are extremely rude. One time the owner came up to me and my friends said if the lunch rush gets crazy he'll have to ask us to leave. This was middle of us eating our lunch and studying while eating. Ugh hate this place."}
{"text":"only William's location in the downtown core Glad that I was able to enjoy my drink with my pups after attending a class at the Pawsway Centre.  Good coffe, drinks and food. Friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"This café always has a great atmosphere. Its great if you want to get work done, but dont like complete silence. Its not too loud, and the environment is great. If you want to plug in a laptop, there are outlets on the side of the building, however the tables on the side are pretty small, good for an individual or two people only. I wish they had outlets on their booths, but its not a big deal. The food here is amazing, their sandwich's and dessert's are delicious. Their beverages are really great as well. I love their vanilla bean lattè, which comes in a big cup! They have free wifi, which is always a bonus !!!! Overall a great place to come hang out at, or get work done, with great food."}
{"text":"A very good place if you need something light and quick to that isn't fast food. The only problem is it's no very easy to find I took me about 5 minutes to find the entrance."}
{"text":"Not a particular fan of their cakes and other sweets but, their milkshakes are pretty good.   With free wifi and and a spacious seating area, one can easily hang around for a couple of hours, whether you want to study or simply, read a book."}
{"text":"We had the fresh brewed iced tea and a lemon tart and it was delicious!  I would have ordered a sandwich but they were saying it was a 45 minute wait for the food to come.  We could have waited as we ended up sitting there that long anyway so maybe next time we'll try the menu.  The staff were friendly and efficient even though it was really busy they didn't appear to be rushing is to leave the table.    I will be back!"}
{"text":"The filthiest place I've ever been in. Not to mention the food is terrible. Biggest regret of my trip to Toronto. There are so many better places than this."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a hot coffee while using the electricity and free wifi, while killing time waiting for a friend.  There was a nice breeze coming through off the lake with the windows wide open and it was so quiet.   A little bird kept flying through to say hello, and it was quite nice.  I only enjoy the coffee so I can't really corroborate the rest of the reviews that indicate the food isn't the best.  The staff were quite helpful, and I enjoyed my peaceful time, and my nice and hot coffee."}
{"text":"Usually go here for breakfast. Good people on staff, much better the last couple of years. Prices are decent, has wi-fi. Can't speak much about mid-day, although in my experience some people just park themselves and their laptops there for hours it seems. We enjoy the ambience usually, great place to meet up, food quality is good."}
{"text":"Visited this place just to check out why people come here to study. I didn't find the seats too comfy or the atmosphere really quiet, so definitely won't be coming here to study. However, the order process is really quick. You place and pay for your order at the front and they'll give you a number to find you wherever you are seated. I ordered a chai latte with a grilled pesto panini which came with sweet potato fries. The sauce for the Sweet Potato fries was amazing!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best casual cafe in the city. They are friendly and are eager to please offering fresh food and quick service all in a wonderfully dog and pet friendly environment."}
{"text":"Although this place is great to hang out for a meeting our quick bite, it lacks any customer service. Had to wait a few minutes before being asked for my order. Unfortunately, not always consistent with the food. I've come quite often to this location and it's a hit or miss with both the service and food. Guess it depends on the mood of the employees."}
{"text":"It's a go a very nice urban  café feel to it.  Most of the snacks are great and the same goes away for the drinks as well. I think it could use a little updating with the snack menu though. Stay away from the yogurt smoothies if possible. I ordered a peach flavoured one and couldn't take in more than a few sips because it started tasting rather chalky; the texture didn't agree with me."}
{"text":"It seems like management took some time to think where to put everything and I appreciate the effort. They have swinging doors to keep pets outside the ordering area. Tables and chairs are decently spaced. Overall, it's wheelchair accessible.  Pricing is a bit steep for the quality, especially considering that they call themselves a \"coffee pub\". The food is quite good with a moderate wait time. Expect regular big chain quality for the drinks, though. Baristas here are worse at microfoam than Starbucks."}
{"text":"I come to Wills Pub to recover after a long day of craziness. I like how this place closes at 2am and has free wifi! I see that many people just grab a hot beverage and kick it back with a laptop or a newspaper. They usually have a black board filled with todays specials and I end up ordering everything. I like grabbing a mocha latté with a grilled chicken rice box (corn, avacado, rice, black beans and tomato) with a special yogurt sauce. If I'm not in the mood for that, I grab their artisan soups which are tomato or butternut squash, along with three cheese tomato & herbs panini or the chipotle turkey club panini. If I want something light and sweet to accompany my mocha latté, I get the strawberry crêpe... its delicious! Great café near me and will be coming back to experiment through other menu items ;)"}
{"text":"We loved this place.  After the dog training was over, all of us including the puppy went for a treat here.  I wish more places were as accomodating as this.  By the way, the dog and i loved the sausage that comes with the all day breakfast.  We will be back (dog included) for sure.  I am now one of your biggest fans."}
{"text":"Good coffee. Cakes are hit and miss, sometimes they are fresh but other times seems a bit old and crusty. Great little place for a coffee with ur buddies or just to hang out by urself and work on school or office assignments."}
{"text":"This is an ok place and it's pet-friendly if you happen to be walking your dog in the area.  The service is usually friendly but I'm not too impressed with the food.  I ordered the egg salad wrap but it was pretty much all lettuce (not particularly tasty lettuce either) and barely had anything else in it. The food and drinks are overpriced but I guess you're paying to be on the water.  Not sure I'd visit again."}
{"text":"My family enjoys coming to William's Cafe. We make sure we bring our laptop or ipad. We usually come here for drinks and dessert. My favorite is large chai latte. We usually order waffle with ice cream, slice of chocolate cake and their tiger brownies. But lately, we also enjoy ordering panini sandwiches, flat pizza (must try!) and sweet potato fries. One of our favorite place to relax and enjoy family time"}
{"text":"My search for some free wifi up here in Brampton lead me here over the closest Starbucks, and it was my first time at a Williams in over 4 years I believe and it's exactly as I remembered. I guess I was hoping too much to expect it to be changed much. '  I was very disappointed the latte and light snack I had, my latte was just better than one I could have got at a place like a bus terminal, just foam on top of a bland coffee. I'm hoping that this was me being unlucky and that on average they serve better drinks. Prices are decent and comparable to most coffee shops around,  I do give them props for staying open till late, having ample comfy seating space and providing free wifi, which is why this is a 3 star review and not a 2 star.   The crowd here was a mix and match of all kinds of people, while it's not a place I would come to get work done there were still students with heavy binders and laptops getting work done, friends catching up, some families and people treating it as a quick coffee stop. Overall I would say a medium noise level, but it's large enough you could find yourself a quieter spot. I believe they do have a drive through as well in full suburban fashion.   Staff seem very efficient in clearing out tables and making sure customers are well taken care of and were friendly behind the counter. Overall if I were to do some catching up with a friend around this area, Williams would be high up on my list as it is more comfortable for longer stays than a Starbucks."}
{"text":"Rating is based on the following:  Two stars for food   Five stars for being the only dog friendly eatery in Toronto"}
{"text":"Pretty nice place to stop by and grab a bite if you're in the Harbourfront area. Grab a seat by the window to enjoy a nice view of the water. The breakfast wrap I got here was pretty average, nothing bad, nothing great. I also got an iced tea which was pretty good. I tried ordering the funky monkey waffle, but unfortunately for me, they didn't have it that day. My boyfriend on the other hand had a coffee and sweet potato fries. The fries were tasty and crispy. The entrance is pretty hard to find though as it is connected with a pet centre (?) of sorts."}
{"text":"The best place I have found in Toronto! Amazing service, incredible friendly and accommodating employees, and phenomenal food. I wish I could eat her everyday!"}
{"text":"Williams cafeteria is a great concept that's so old it's fresh.   I haven't been to one of these places since the last time I was in Ontario, or a high school cafeteria.  You order your food from the menu, pay at the cashier and then sit down to wait for the food to come.    The place looks like a family restaurant, bright, clean and open friendly.   I had a salad.  The usual for me these days.  When to dish arrived, the greens looked a bit wilted, but nothing wrong with it.  Overall it's fast and efficient and a good place to have a lunch with coworkers.    I'd come back."}
{"text":"The pepper sauce is amazing. I always like to try hot sauces and Williams crafted a pepper sauce. Love it. And everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is a bit of an escape for me, I like the sammiches and the big bowls with a handle one gets the drinks in. When I've met up with a guest here and there, it looks good on me, they say \"you chose a great place.\" I've seen the thick textbook-toting-campers here too. Oh, the offerings are good here."}
{"text":"Much better than the Second Cup latte we had earlier in the week!"}
{"text":"Visited with my boyfriend early one Sunday, loved the environment. Ordered food and drinks, came very quick and the fruits were pretty fresh, the chicken quesadilla I ordered was freshly made as well. Only thing is that the price is a little up there based of the portion size. But the place is clean, neat, and the staff stays on top of keeping the tables cleared. Perfect place to multitask and do work, or just hang with friends."}
{"text":"Great location and views!  Lots of gluten free choices with the rice boxes.  The food was good, especially the chipotle chicken.  It was super tender and well-seasoned.  The beta blast smoothie was also delicious; it was basically a melted orange creamsicle. The prices for the food were right, but the smoothie was expensive.  Definitely a good option for a quick lunch on the go."}
{"text":"I wish this place was better. It's so close to me, and in a good location when people come to the harbourfront on sunny weekends.  If you like dogs, you will enjoy just sitting here. They aren't too annoying either. I wish they removed that silly pet centre (I do not care for animals) and replaced it with something more useful/interesting.   I generally come here to sit down and read, since there's space. Unfortunately the coffee actually sucks. I am judging by their standard american style brewed coffee, which is on par with tim hortons - so very crappy. At least it's cheap.  I've been to a Williams in waterloo and it was a diner. This is not the same."}
{"text":"I enjoy stopping to have a quick little treat, however I would recommend going in to enjoy as a pose to the drive thru. Products seem to be carefully chosen when seating in person. My drive thru experience was pleasant until I got home and realize the two pieces of cake I ordered tasted like fridge....  We all know who disappointing that could be. Our red velvet was simply not edible.   I do like the loyalty program but they don't always prompt you which is a downfall as I don't always remember.   The place itself is clean and bright, a nice place to study or meet with friends for coffee.   Beats Starbucks loud atmosphere."}
{"text":"I still love the dessert, drinks, and milkshakes at William's, but after an encounter with the owner Anna, I doubt I will visit this establishment again. If you have a lap top or book, do not bother going here. You'll be treated deplorably. There is a rule that if you \"have a book, you are studying\" and must relocate to the small, outer tables which wasn't a problem with me. Anna's delivery and attitude of these instructions were what completely offended me. I don't understand how as an owner of a business, you would treat your customers so rudely. I was so offput by the experience, I have not returned since.  This was on Sunday, December 1, 2013."}
{"text":"I see this place in many ways better than a Starbucks or similar coffee shop.  They have more room, so you will definitely get a table, (compared to some cafes where each small table is taken by one person with a laptop).  This location was clean, good lighting, good service, and the options for breakfast were bigger than your average coffee shop.  I would definitely go back, in particular for breakfast meetings where I need to be able to talk."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh breakfast foods! I had a green smoothie and a gluten-free everything bagel with garlic cream cheese. Our server was super friendly, but she could have used someone to help her out when it got really busy. Great location next to the lake, and dog friendly."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend Saturday night in Brampton. Williams is actually a nice place, a cute cafe that almost reminds you of Coras but on a more cozy scale with its ambience.  I had their latte in a huge mug, and it was delighful.  Along with that was their cookies, and for those who know me im a huge cookie monster.   Overall this place is clean ,homey, and the staff are friendly.  You could spend hours here if you're with the right company.    4/5 is my take on this place."}
{"text":"I can not tell a lie ... great place. Found this place recently while walking Jasper. He's dragged me back ever since.  Dog friendly ... absolutely.                      But  The food is great, the espresso drinkable and the service wonderful.  Worth spending some time and $$ in!"}
{"text":"Nothing special to say about William's. Coffee is average at best and the food as well. It's cute seeing pets walk in and out of this location though"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and a good place to study. Id recommend you stick to beverages and desserts."}
{"text":"$5 breakfast is $5 plus tax. it also sucks  They use that crappy premade scrambled egg crap and microwave bacon, at least the toast was good. Oh yeah the potatoes taste like they were made of.. clay or something. Don't eat the food here.   Coffee is decent, I got it when I was drunk off my ass one nuit blanche that they were open at 4 am. To my major disappointment they did not do the same thing the next year, leaving me stranded on a deserted and freezing waterfront very early in the morning, it especially sucks when there's no coffee.  to my displeasure this is in some weird dog center, apparently the cafe is co-habitual between patrons and animals. Thankfully there were no dogs when I ate here. I suppose this is a good setup if you are a dog person, but for everyone else who doesn't want animals trying to get into the food you are trying to enjoy don't come here.  Also don't come here if you like good breakfast. Coffee is decent though. And the barista is cute."}
{"text":"Great work atmosphere. Food is Always on point. Especially the rice boxes. Pricey though"}
{"text":"Been twice now since we moved..and I gotta say...they really should just cut down on the whole lunch/dinner type menu and focus on what this place really is - a full on elaborate version of starbucks with meet-you-in-the-middle table service and free wifi with plenty of booths and chill time.   The dessert selection is pretty decent except..my only suggestion would be to also add acouple of light mousse type desserts. Currently the selections are all quite rich (cheesecakes, cakes, brownies) basically very rich in flour. Sometimes one just wants espresso mousse or tiramisu mousse...so there's something to think bout.  However, I've tried both their cafe-au-lait and latte and both were EXQUISITE. definitely an upgrade from sbux..I will go back but will stay away from the food."}
{"text":"Grab a harbour-view window seat after you take your selfies with the giant cat statue outside!  I tried the pacific salmon rice box with garlic yogurt sauce, as well as the chicken quesadilla. They were both really satisfying. I really liked that the salmon rice box came with brown rice and avocado in it.  This was one of the more affordable meals that my partner and I had while visiting Toronto. If you're checking out or staying in the harbour area, and appreciate lighter and healthy tasting grub, I highly recommend coming here.  I'm kind of surprised that this place only has a 3 star average... I think it's because it's a chain. Coming from the US, I'd never tried it before, but I enjoyed the food and the waterfront view."}
{"text":"Not very cozy. I tried the classic breakfast that I love, but the eggs were not well made.  They do take the waterfront experience card though, which I like. Gives you 10% off!!"}
{"text":"Good setting, selections of good coffee. Love the hot chocolate and the large cups, fantastic desserts. Never had an issue with the service till date but will admit that I've never once gone there to study so can't make any comments on that.   All in all still a good place for a stop in between different from timmies!"}
{"text":"I happen to be a big Williams fan. I come from an area with many, and have always found them comfortable and inviting. Great place for a friendly get together. Good menu selection."}
{"text":"Hamilton pizza is delicious!! Nice cafe near waterfront"}
{"text":"We really Love this place! Friendly service and fresh food! Best coffee in the area  :-)"}
{"text":"This is one of the only places that allow dogs. It is located inside purina pawsway. They serve a variety of different food. They have salads, sandwiches, breakfast and etc.   I ordered a Caesar salad with chicken breast and a cup of tea. The chicken beast was really good.  It was soft and juicy.    It is a good place to grab a snack or coffee while you wait for your dog to finish training class."}
{"text":"We were here after a charity walk hubby did for Dog Guides & needed a snack. So we got the sweet potato fries with a bottle of water. The fries were good. They were battered though, which I can't have all the time. But the food was fresh & tasty. You order at the counter & they bring your food to your table. Decent food for a small cafe like this. Good service as well."}
{"text":"This used to be my local dessert/coffee stop. Great lattes, cappuccinos, mochaccinos and desserts. My usual was the Vanilla bean latte - not too sweet, and large cup!   Williams is a great place to meet up with friends or just to hang out with your significant other. This location gets fairly busy, although you can usually find a spot - just not a booth or near an electrical outlet. It is popular amongst students and they can sit there for hours. It is one of the better cafes, and although I love Tims, its a better ambiance and more relaxed and comfortable environment. The noise level can get a loud, but it suits the cafe.  They have a drive through!! I can not begin to count how many times I got takeout for their Strawberry Shortcake's! Truly divine and one of the best strawberry shortcakes! They also have seasonal specials, like pumpkin lattes and cakes. I recommend trying this next season!"}
{"text":"If by \"fresh\" they mean freshly opened bag, then the name is accurate. I ordered coffee and cobb salad with chicken. Coffee was good. The  chicken is clearly just frozen, pre-cooked processed chicken complete with phony grill marks. Albiet higher quality processed chicken, if thats a thing. It wasnt completely nauseating as some are.  Egg was also a clearly pre-packaged too perfect hard boiled egg.  Bacon wasn't chopped as it should be, just strips apparantly ripped in half. And again the quality of the bacon is about as low as you can buy. It makes me recall memories of wotking at my first job, a pizzeria, where we'd \"cook\" bacon  via the microwave. Which is what this type of bacon is designed for. Think tim hortons, burger king etc. Definitely not what ibwas expecting.  I've never had goat cheese on a cobb salad before, and it's not for me. The mushy texture with mushy egg, avocado, and processed chicken was edible, but did not compliment the salad in any way. This salad calls for a hard cheese. Maybe cheddar, asiago etc...anything but mushy goat cheese.  I've never eaten here before, and with so many other options out there, I doubt I'd return. Especially at $17-18 for this salad and a small coffee."}
{"text":"I like the Chai Latte.. I think I had the tuna melt sandwich or something like that it was okay.. I should of got dessert after but I didn't lol.. Next time."}
{"text":"I think Williams Coffee Pub inside Pawsway is awesome because this is the only coffee place in Toronto that you can really bring your pets in and enjoy your drinks and have a small bite.  For non pet lovers, there are a lot of other options in the area! Tim Hortons, Starbucks and Second Cup all within walking distance!  I'm bring my dog here next time!!"}
{"text":"Go across the street to Starbucks.   Service is going down and staff are apathetic. Food is also losing quality. After 5 years, I had this cashier tell me they rarely carried hot sauce as a condiment. Never heard that one before. What next? Maybe black pepper and salt are also short in rationing?  It's fine if you are new to the city or think it's a \"cute\" place for a date.   But there is Hero burger and Quesada right across the street for a quick bite and as I said ... Starbucks... if you want to sit and read or study.   Avoid."}
{"text":"Enjoying my carrot cake and chai hot chocolate which I might add is delicious! I like that they have outlets here so I can pull out my laptop and do my work PLUS enjoy a slice of cake and hot beverage. The only downer right now is that the wifi isn't working!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Williams Coffee Pub very much for what it is. It's a good place to meet with others, sit down and enjoy a beverage and/or a meal. I quite like their sandwiches and their soups (although i've had far better French onion soup elsewhere). I haven't tried the desserts, but others have told me that they are very good, particularly the carrott cake. I don't find the coffee all that great for a place that bills itself as a coffee pub, but I'm usually there as an alternative to Starbucks or a fast food place for a place to meet and to get a quick meal."}
{"text":"I come here a lot. Love coming here with my boyfriend for dessert or with friends to catch up. I especially love coming here in the mornings to work on my laptop and have some coffee and breakfast. I am never disappointed with the food or service. I gave 4 stars because the Internet is really slow and makes it really hard to work. If the Internet service improves I would definitely give 5 stars!"}
{"text":"William's is located in the Purina's Paw Way building.  It's a dog friendly cafe.  I went there with my friend and her dog and thought that it must be really nice to have a coffee place where owners and their pets could hang out.  After a few minutes, i kind of changed my mind.  A dog peed on the floor while i was deciding on what drinks to order.  A staff member cleaned up the floor, but the area was just wet after.   The staff i talked to was very friendly.  I asked her what drinks are good, and she mentioned that all the smoothies are great.  So i ordered a mango banana pineapple smoothie.  It tasted like liquid powder.  At least my friend's dog liked it."}
{"text":"the best place for a cheap and flavorful dessert"}
{"text":"This visit was my first and last time visiting here. I came here under a friend's suggestion for lunch. It was a place I always passed by but never had a chance to visit. My first impression of this place was that it was quite nice and well decorated. Then when I went to sit down at a table to wait for my friend it was very evident that it hadn't been wiped down... Not off to a good start. As I was looking at the menu to decide what to get the cashier right away asked if I was ready to order. This was a bit promising.  When my friend arrived I ordered the spinach and feta quiche and a medium chai tea latte. She ordered the roasted veggie and goat cheese panini. We waited about 10 minutes for our entrées to come out. Before sitting down in a booth I had to wipe down the table myself...  Hers came out first then was quickly followed by mine. My spinach and feta quiche was not the traditional one with a pie crust. It was crustless over top arugula and a pastry base. It was pretty tasty and I think it was worth the $5.99. However this is where my experience goes down hill.  I ate my quiche pretty slowly considering how hungry I was and this was not due to having company with me but due to the fact that I didn't get my chai tea latte yet. It came AFTER I was done my quiche... Not pleased about this.  After our food we decided we wanted something sweet so we got the Turtle Cheesecake. At this point I decided to time how long it would take them from when I put in my order to get my cheesecake. It took them about 10 minutes. I would understand if they were super slammed with order but it was just my cheesecake and no one else ordered prior to me. There was a guy who came in and ordered what looked like a chocolate milkshake. He also had to wipe down his table as well. He got the milkshake within 3 minutes and then that's when the server saw my number and got my cheesecake. She did apologize for the wait however so that was nice I guess.  The Turtle Cheesecake was pretty tasty. It had caramel and pecans :D  I don't understand when it's not busy and there are at least 3 or 4 staff working one of them couldn't have gone around and checked the tables to see if they needed to be wiped down."}
