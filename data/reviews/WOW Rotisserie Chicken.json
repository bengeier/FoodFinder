{"text":"This place was NOT what I expected.  And in a good way!  
I only came here for lunch when the wait for a Craft Burger at looked unacceptable.  It was one of those flukes that end beautifully.

I was shocked at the fantastic prices here, particularly for King West.  My cheeseburger and poutine came to 10 bucks!  All the burgers come fully loaded, with sauteed onions, tomato, pickle, lettuce, ketchup, mustard and mayo.  Cheese is real, not processed.  
My co-eater had the roasted chicken and poutine, also 10 bucks.  He said it tasted homemade.  
You can get the Family Pack here, which, for only 20 bucks, you get a whole chicken, salad, fries or rice.  I'm also dying to go back to try the Sweets Sampler platter, where for only 6.50 you can get a sample of ALL their desserts...including cheesecake, brownie, cream puff, and apple crisp!  Oh la la.

A really pleasant surprise and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Like others I was hesitant to go inside due to how the exterior looks, but once in I was kind of shocked.  Its actually quite nice and extremely clean and well kept inside.  The prices are the lowest in the area and damn are the portions big.  I got a chicken/beef burger with fries and a drink and it came under $9. Even came with a side of coleslaw.  And I've gotta say, I liked the burger better than Craft burger.  Now I kind of feel bad for dismissing it for so long, and only hope others know about it so it sticks around, as I'll definitely be adding it to the lunch time rotation."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the overbearing, trashy-looking sign on the front window. Food and price are great."}
