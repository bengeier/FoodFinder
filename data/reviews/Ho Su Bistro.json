{"text":"My coworkers and I used to frequent Ho Su often until a few of us didn't feel so great after eating there one day. We gave it another shot and the same thing happened. We all had the same thing - bento boxes - some of us had beef teriyaki, some chicken teriyaki. We figured it was something common in the boxes. Likely the glass noodles because both times they tasted off - strange after taste. Crossed this off our list and we now go down the street to another sushi establishment - a bit more in price but at least we feel good after eating there!"}
{"text":"Good food for the price. Better than many other sushi places on Queen St. so it's my go-to in the area."}
{"text":"Ho Su bistro, Yonge & Eglinton location is my Go-To place on the way home from work for cheap take out dinner - Korean Japanese. What draws me is the comfort food at great prices. I usually get the bulgoki on rice takeout - comes with a canned pop. They fill the styro takeout box to the brim with meat, salad, chap chae noodles and rice. Nothing fancy or striking, more  like regular asian home cooking that you don't have to cook yourself. One takeout meal is about enough for 2 people. Make tea at home and you are done quickly with no dishes to wash in the evening!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite restaurant for years but the New Year's Eve service has totally ruined it for me and my friends. I will continue to eat there but I won't tip much anymore.

Basically, we ordered. The food took a long time to get to us which is a little abnormal considering they weren't too busy. Especially since I frequent this restaurant several times a month. It took around 40 mins for food to arrive. My boyfriend wanted to order a second item and the head cook actually walked by our table and glared at him. Maybe because he's black? I'm suspicious. Around 12PM a rude waitress told us: \"You have to leave.\" No, sorry - we are closing. Just you have to leave? So, we left abs paid our bills but they hassled us to leave even more so no one got change. We all over-tipped by $3-$6 dollars. Once our small group was out we had a waitress chase after us, specifically, my boyfriend saying he never paid in full. Bullshit, considering he fucking over-tipped too because I saw him put over the amount and complained about it. Being a nice guy he paid the waitress more then the difference on the fucking street. Too bad I was walking ahead of our group at the time and only saw the latter part of the transaction. Or else, that waitress would have a bleeding ear from my yammering. 

Worst service I've ever had in my life. It doesn't help that the black couple beside us had a similar experience too and they seemed to target the black customers at the time. The whole group was Asian including me. I like their mediocre food but that doesn't mean I'll tolerate the way they fucking subjected my boyfriend. Never tipping again. Fuck you, Hosu."}
{"text":"I've visited the restaurant many times because I lived near the area, and overall it's okay. I would go here if I was too tired to cook for the night or if I wanted a quick Asian fix, but it's not recommended for any foodies. 
The sushi is okay, nothing superb, and the Korean food is to be honest really average. I'm Korean so I know how good Korean food tastes like...and their Korean food could be much improved. 
The service was alright- I've never really had a friendly waitress get my order nor did anyone go out of their way to make sure I had a good meal. 
If you have the time, go to Koreatown for better Korean food."}
{"text":"Have been going to this place for their variety of Maki for years. It is a great little spot and the rolls have always been fresh! I have no complaints with it. I always opt for the brown rice which is a nice touch because it's healthier. 
Every time I'm back in Toronto now, this place is a must. 

Their Korean menu is ok, although you're better off going to Christie for the more authentic things. Their kalbi is ok though so I'm not complaining.  Service is always good so it has me coming back, seating in the back is less busy and more laid back. Prefer the queen st location to anything else."}
{"text":"I have a tendency to go to this restaurant when I want to catch a movie flick at Paramount Theaters because it's so close by. Eating here for more that 5 years, I wouldn't say this is the best Japanese (sushi/sashimi) restaurant I've been to but it's still pretty decent with cheap picks! (they also serve Korean dishes, though not authentic). Servers are nice and friendly but sometimes really slow on the service but the last time I went, I think they're getting better. Everything on menu is priced reasonably and for approximately $5, you can get a pretty generous bento lunch that comes with rice, (chicken, beef or salmon) teriyaki, shrimp and veggie tempura, coleslaw and clear rice noodles. Not to shabby at all. But in terms of sushi, they definitely use too much rice and very little fish which is surprisingly pretty fresh. Overall, Ho Su is good casual restaurant to go to but not the best if you're planning to try excellent sushi."}
{"text":"On a rainy night I met a friend at Hosu.  As I was just taking off my jacket, the server asked if we were ready to order.  Uh no.  She came back three times within the next five minutes.  Granted, I was glad she was attentive, but seriously! And when we tried to pay, she took for-ev-er to come and grab the credit card, gah.
My sushi was tasty and so were the free little appetizers, which I so love.  I would go back, and cross my fingers that I had a different server!"}
{"text":"I had fond memories of coming here with my sister for their lunch specials when we both used to work close to each other.  I loved their Korean Chicken & jap chae. 
We recently went back and I was looking forward to it again but was disappointed.  Had the korean chicken lunch bento box and california rolls.  My chicken was bland, jap chae was overly peppery and the roll was too warm.  I lost my appetite not even half way through so I didn't finish it.  
Not sure what happened Hosu....you were so good once upon a time."}
{"text":"Casual sushi / asian restaurant. Relatively inexpensive sushi and bento boxes. I go here for meals on the fly. This is not a high end restaurant. Service is pretty good and the food is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to dine with friends and family."}
{"text":"Came here today to find out all of the specials are Gone. The 507 was one of my favourite things to eat in Toronto. I guess I won't be coming back anymore.... your prices are insane now. No way am I paying $17 to get something similar to the 507. 
This change is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The only thing I come here is for the take out. 
It is relatively cheap and *very* fast, even with tempura. 
Great joint, loved by students and teachers nearby."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time tonight. Ordered online. Love it! Fresh, excellent portions and very yummy. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Reasons for dropping down 1. Sushi is now just good, not great. Simple, but uninspired presentation. 2. Owner/Manager/Hostest? treats the place like an assembly line 3. What the hell is that NON-STOP churning sound, it's like you're eating in a f-ing jet engine 4. Guys, get rid of the homeless encampment next door."}
{"text":"I've been to Hosu many times in the past and it was great!  But they have become so stingy on everything now (including refilling water and tea!).  

Before, you would get the free Korean side dishes, but you don't get any of that anymore.  Not only that, but the portion size in my bento was sad...  I literally only got 8 pieces of korean chicken.  Also, my glass noodles were definitely old as they were chewy and the noodles were sticking together.   Not fresh at all. 

The service was mediocre too.  The server never came to refill our tea and water and did not ask how the food was.  

I will never go back there again.  If you want better quality asian food, go to the restaurants on Dundas St.  Queen St. restaurants have become so depressing..."}
{"text":"Hosu is a mix of Japanese and Korean food. It's a bit of a chain with a few locations, they do delivery and they sure can process a ton of people through the lunch hour. When I used to work across the street, I liked that I got a 10% discount with my employee card and that they could take and make an order in ten minutes. What's not so good? The sushi cuts are not the cleanest in the city, so the sashimi sometimes tastes mildly fishy, it's best to stick to bento boxes, maki and their noodle and soup dishes. It leans more towards Korean than anything else, so if you like meat, this is a quick, easy way to grab some Korean BBQ for lunch. They have a small patio out front that turns over quickly if you'd prefer to people watch in the summer as well."}
{"text":"They have friendly staff!!! I usually get their bentos but the sushi there is a little bit made too quick ...therefore a little less effort is made but its still good!!"}
{"text":"AWFUL!!! we ordered for delivery last night, and fully understand its busy, the women on the phone said it would take 45mins for delivery (we live 5mins drive from there) so, no problem... after 1h25mins, we called, and the women said \"listen, i told you we are busy, you wait!\" so sweet she was... Then at 1:40mins, we called, she said \"you called me already, I said you wait!!!\"... after 1:50mins, the food showed up, it wasnt hot, it wasnt warm, it was cold. Chicken teriyaki cold is not amazing, but try to have cold tempura!!!...I didnt even want to bother calling back to get more abuse from this women. I will NEVER order from there, and a single apology would of probably help."}
{"text":"I went for dinner once in the summer. The space is dark and the atmosphere is claustrophobic. The food is good and I love that its half a korean restaurant and half japanese. Not a great first date spot- or any date really. 

So I decided takeout is the way to go. The food is mostly on-time, still warm, and delicious. 

However, its the attitude of the staff I don't appreciate. From walking in and hearing them talk trash about customers in cantonese, to having a delivery man yell at me. Its just NOT appropriate customer service. I received CALLS and notes on my delivery TELLING me : I NEED to tip their drivers and theres a button I can press to add $3 tip. It's like telling me I NEED to pay THEIR staff. When my food arrives at my door, then I will TIP, (a GRATUITY- not an obligation)

This ONE time I didn't have change so I paid for a $23(and some cents) bill with $25 and gave me dirty looks and said \"WE depend on tip.\"

I said: Sorry thats all I have

And he YELLED at me! He started swearing and saying how people were CHEAP and I RUINED HIS DAY.

EXCUSE ME? No matter how much I enjoy their food, their service leaves me sick to the stomach. 

NOTE to HOSU: Goodbye."}
{"text":"This place blew me out of the water. It could be that I'm a Vancouverite and thus always set my sushi expectations low if I am anywhere else in the world, but we stumbled into Ho Su expecting average sushi and got so much more!

My friend ordered a chicken teriyaki bento box (\"probably the best box she's ever tasted\"), and I ordered the sashimi bento which was on special for 8.95 and an avocado cucumber roll.   Two seconds later, the waitress stopped by with edamame, miso soups, and some Korean appetizers ( kimchi, some kind of bean (soy?) in sauce and possibly some kind of tuber in a spicy-ish sauce. Quite tasty.  

On top of all that, the boxes both came with healthy portions of salad and rice.  My friend's tempura was crispy, rather well-breaded (perhaps slightly overly so) and not very greasy at all.  My sashimi was probably a larger portion than I would have gotten ordering just a small sashimi platter on its own for a similar price. 

Very, very impressed, both with the value for money and the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I used to really like Ho Su. The one on queen west has always been good for me. But this one on Yonge street has been very disappointing. We ordered the yellowtail and green onion ( Niri Hagamachi I think) - it did not taste good at all. I've eaten this roll dozens of times before - here and at other restaurants. We told the waitress that the tuna roll did not taste \"right\" and she said \"it's not  Tuna, it's yellowtail.\" We informed her yellowtail was a type of tuna. She said ohhhh and walked away. No offer to fix the problem, and no apology. Everything else was ok. The kimchi soup was awesome as usual. This location needs to really improve for me to return."}
{"text":"I used to go there once a month. BUT NOT ANYMORE. Server is always on the phone or staring customers. Washroom was dirty, really cheap service. Then when I paid bill (It was not good experience that's why I gave them tips but lower than average) one of server said \"I think you made mistake\" She thought they could get more tips. I was so disappointed and surprised. How come? I paid. I gave them tips. It was not enough for them. But they should do more better service. Never go again!"}
{"text":"Went here for pick-up a couple times, won't be back again. Last time I was overcharged and got home to find my order totally wrong. Walk a few blocks, To-Ne is much better for the cost."}
{"text":"The food was okay. Servers could be better. Also the heater wasnt working so it was freezing in the restaurant, I had to eat with my jacket on. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Went for a Saturday lunch.  Ordered the Futo maki california roll lunch and the 10 piece sushi lunch.  Futo maki was packed with a nice amount of spinach. 
  
The lunch came with edamame which was a bonus.

Hosu is a casual sit where you like environment.  The place is clean, the meal came quickly, and for $7.95 per lunch special, it's a steal!  Took some time to get the server's attention for the bill, but if in a rush you can always pay directly at the front, which is what we did.

Also ordered from take out another time and we were just as pleased with the food quality, taste and price.  Just be careful when you order over the phone, it's easy to mix up the Lunch Specials and the Pick up/Take out menu items.  We were told that the latter are a smaller portion and don't come with soup and salad, but they are also a couple bucks cheaper than their Lunch Special counterparts."}
{"text":"Good, middle-of-the road sushi.  The place is pretty cramped, but there's a good selection of Japanese and Korean food and service is quick and responsive."}
{"text":"I went for a date here. The place is an affordable place to take someone out for a date. Its casual so you can meet up a friend here for a casual date with a low-key environment. And affordable. And home like too"}
{"text":"Restaurant is alright, they have pretty decently priced lunch specials (~$7-$13) so that's probably why it's so packed during lunch hour. The food was pretty average. I had the chicken teriyaki lunch box (~$8). The chicken was a bit dry and little too much sauce (and too sweet) on the korean glass noodles for my liking. The box also included rice, coleslaw , bean sprouts and carrots which were pretty much fillers. Lunch also comes with standard salad and miso soup. 

The space was pretty tight and we were sitting at the back of the restaurant, so it was pretty stuffy half way through our meal. The lights were also really dim, so I was pretty drowsy as well. Be mindful if you are going as a group, they already charge 15% service tax on the bill! 

Being on Queen St W., I would walk a bit further for Japanese food that is around the same price."}
{"text":"The S.O: Whaddya feel like eating?
Me: I dunno. What do YOU feel like eating?
The S.O: Korean?
Me: Koreatown's too far.
The S.O: Wanna order from Ho Su?
Me: Sigh. O.K.

We have this exact conversation once every 2-3 weeks. And it pretty much sums up how I feel about Ho Su: default option for Korean when I'm too lazy to cook it myself or make the schlep.

For a Japanese-Korean restaurant that has no Japanese or Korean language on the menu, and caters to a mostly white clientele, the food at Ho Su isn't that bad--especially given their portion-to-price ratios. (Geez, that sentence had more disclaimers than a car ad.)

My favorite thing to get here is #70, the hwae dop bop (raw fish on rice that you mix together with a tangy-spicy sauce, $10). The S.O. usually gets #57, the bulgogi bento ($10), or one of the big, spicy Korean soups (#71-73, $9-10).

I've given up on the Japanese side of the menu as the cooked dishes never taste quite right to me and they stick you with undesirable fish cut in weird ways in the sushi/sashimi combinations.

I always marvel at how Ho Su is consistently packed for lunch and dinner. I guess the low prices, high-traffic location, and English-speaking staff keep the hoards a-coming."}
{"text":"NOT RECOMMENDED Hosu bistro - #35 smoked salmon salad $6.95 smoked salmon on top of mixed greens is actually 4 pieces of smoked salmon on top of iceberg lettuce and 9 slivers of carrot with 3 X the needed dressing ($6.95 plus tax HST)"}
{"text":"We ordered the sashimi appetizer, Salmo  sushi pizza and the galbi.  The sashimi pieces were rather small, but the taste was good.  The pizza was delicious, the rice \"crust\" was a good proportion - not too big.  The galbi wad really yummy.   One thing that we didn't really like was the big fruit fly type things that kept disturbing our meal.  That was a total turn off - having to see this and having to swat them away while we tried to eat."}
{"text":"the Toronto Lover system:

4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.

Ho Su provides tasty sushi at affordable prices in an extremely good location. If you're a tourist, eat on the patio that overlooks Queen/John, the \"MuchMusic intersection\" in one of Toronto's coolest and most televised areas.

I have no complaints about this place. They have sushi for every level of sushi fan; try anything with avocado or salmon: it will taste creamy and delicious. The prices are the norm, with sushi combinations from $5-$15 and most entrees costing around $12.


Complimentary appetizers like Kim chi, salad, miso soup, edamame, will arrive at your table with most sushi orders.

4 stars"}
{"text":"Ho Su Bistro is still my favourite spot to grab some sushi and yummy Korean dishes. Everything has remained great at this restaurant for me except the fact I've been noticing that occasionally the food is inconsistent.

I've practically tried everything on their menu over the past few years and sometimes the dishes are not what they used to be. Their spicy based soups sometimes lack spice, and their salmon teriyaki can be very fishy smelling and small at times- this was not the case before. Also, the salmon sushi pizza appetizer is almost always big and fresh, and other times it's small and greasy.

In the end, I love the food here and will return over and over again. I just can't give my five-star to a place that occasionally is inconsistent with their food."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in Toronto, for sure.
The service here is excellent,the food is fresh.
I have introduced so many friends to this place,one of the server remember my name and makes me feel special:@
The most popular food are the Galbi and Hosu roll."}
{"text":"HoSu Bistro is my backup Japanese restaurant in the area (Lola Sushi is my first choice). I opt for HoSu when I'm too tired to walk down to Lola or if I have an instant sushi craving after work. 

I find their food to be average. Sometimes I find the quality to be lacking, and the food appears to be 'pre-made'. When ordering takeout, the order is sometimes missing rice or soup. Once, the waitress took my take out order incorrectly and I ended up with something else. The service is prompt, but I'm afraid that it has something to do with the meals being pre-made. 

I usually order the shrimp tempura, katsudon or the dol sim bop (I found out about this when they took my order incorrectly). I don't order their rolls anymore."}
{"text":"The chirashi don is super small for what you pay for. I used to come here a lot but it seems like its under new management and portion sizes are so much smaller. It used to be much better. Bentos remain more or less the same but mains that costs more are smaller now."}
{"text":"I used to eat at HoSu regularly but lately my gang of friends has been heading across the road to Sushi Time.
I like Ho Su for the little kimchi, soy beans and potato julienne  appetizers they bring you shortly after you've ordered and they don't charge extra for tea. 
The sushi is good + fresh. Servers are nice.
Don't count of getting great food/service If you go there near closing time, which is fairly early for Queen Street (I believe 10 or 11 p.m.)"}
{"text":"Came with some friends for lunch.

I ordered: 

#12 steak bento box lunch special $10.50: Miso soup was mediocre. The bento box comes with chap chae(korean glass noodle), rice, Korean Soybean Sprouts, rice, 3 pieces of broccoli, and steak on a bed of bean sprouts.  Aside from the korean glass noodle(which tasted average), everything was below average.  The steak was low quality and probably overcooked.   Rating: 2/5. 

Won't come back."}
{"text":"Used to be my favourite sushi place in the city. Until I found a COCKROACH in MY FOOD. That was pretty awful. 

Photo posted in the pictures section."}
{"text":"I always ordered the vegetarian options when I ate here, so I can't speak for the fish. Anyhow, the owner often takes the orders at the cash, he has a real attitude. Sometimes he would sit there for 5 minutes looking at his phone with an empty restaurant and not take your order, or your order is done and on the counter and he wouldn't get up and give it to you (I asked the chef if I could just have it since I had already paid and he said he wasn't allowed to hand it to me...I had to stand there with my food almost in arms reach and wait for the owner to hand it to me...). He would just sit there till he felt like giving you your order. I'm not kidding! Anyhow, I made my order and the sushi chef began to make it and then horked into the sink. Yes, he cleared phlegm from his throat and spit it into the sink and proceeded to continue to make my sushi...without washing his hands (not that that makes it okay)...I was so taken back and grossed out that I didn't know what to say. I paid for my order walked out and dumped it in the garbage outside. So, between the owner giving attitude and the chefs being so totally gross. No thanks."}
{"text":"Been to HoSu a few times before and it was fine but last night's dinner (after a movie) was terrible. The chicken in my Korean-style Bento Box was cold. Tempura was too thick, even in the Toronto roll there were too many flakes. Won't be back ever again. Walk north to better options in Chinatown."}
{"text":"HoSu gets a 4 star rating because of the value that you get.  For $5 you can get a takeout chicken teriyaki lunch complete with rice, glass noodles and veggies and bean sprouts.  It's enough food to last for 2 meals.  The chicken is moist and flavorful.  It's a solid go to lunch option in Queen West.

While it's not the best sushi out there, you get a decent meal for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, wide selection of asian fusion, great location. 

This is a great option for quick eats on a budget with a great selection."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in the city for brown rice! Their brown rice is soft and delicious and very healthy but doesn't compromise taste! The rest of the dishes are wonderful too, the fish is very fresh and the rolls are exciting and different! If you are looking for good brown rice sushi that isn't all-you-can eat then this is the place!

The service isn't great. They aren't super friendly and sometimes you wonder if they are listening properly because they do get a mistake with our order every time we go there. They always fix it but we have to wait for the proper dish to come out and they don't bring out anything complimentary to make up for the mistake. I try to be very clear with them now when I go!!

One Liner: For the best brown rice sushi in the city this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"terrible.  ordered the sashimi lunch, no side dishes just a small plate of edamame. sashimi was small (think tiny square chunks vs juicy slices) and tastless.  white fish was the worst.  avoid, much better options in the area... does not compare at all to the hosu on queen, quality and serving size just does not measure up."}
{"text":"Vegan in Loooove!! I love Ho Su. So do my 3 and 4 y old. All vegan, we are able to order just about anything off of the menu. You can also ask for brown rice instead of white. Veggie bi bim bop? YES! Tons of veggie appetizers, maki, hand rolls, and even the broth of the soup can be ordered vegan. The prices are great-some of the best I've seen downtown."}
{"text":"Good, inexpensive sushi location - especially great for casual gatherings. Definitely recommend if you are in the Queen St. W. area, but don't expect anything super fancy!"}
{"text":"Been to Hosu twice in one week and I'll be coming back.

Visit #1: ordered the avocado salad and the deep fried Korean chicken dish (their speciality) - the salad was meh, but the chicken dish was actually pretty good and a huge portion even though I got the small.

Visit #2: ordered the spicy salmon maki and the beef bibimbap, take out. The maki wasn't prepared with care and attention. I probably won't order sushi here again because I have another spot in the area much better, but the bibimbap was awesome. 

The price is right, the food is good as long as you know what to order, and the staff friendly. Hosu is a win."}
{"text":"I love their lunch specials! Great variety at awesome prices! The food (both Jap and Korean) is pretty good and I absolutely adore their side dishes."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in a recent visit to Hosu. I ordered sushi which was pretty bad but it was the quality of my dining companion's meal that is alarming. She ordered Chicken Katsu which came to the table undercooked. It was full out pink. I pointed it out to the waitress who offered to cook it again. My friend was feeling pretty queasy and declined a second cooking. So I asked that we get a discount on our bill. Then the manager came over to tell us that it wasn't undercooked. It was marinade. 

No, there's a difference between a marinated tint and just plain undercooked chicken. Beware of what you're biting into at Hosu."}
{"text":"I am SUPER surprised and delighted to be writing this review. i spent a couple days at the MTCC (Convention Center) this week and had some ABYSMAL meals.  (watch out for my East Side Marios review).  So after today's show, I really wanted some Korean, my companion really wanted Japanese, so we decided to compromise.  When I moved to Toronto a decade ago, HoSu was the go-to, and I went ALL the time for lunch. I had heard that it went downhill and hadn't ventured in years, but we were starving and it was within walking distance so we decided to give it a try. 

I have eaten out almost every day in the last week during a ridiculous work schedule, at cheap dives and nice restaurants, and unbelievably the service at HoSu today was by FAR the best service I have had all week. Our server was beyond attentive. My tea was refilled every couple of minutes, our Korean side-dishes were replaced the second we finished them.  She was there constantly attending to our every need and was so unobtrusive, that we didn't even notice her. I would look down and my tea was full.

Additionally the food was good! I had the silken tofu soup (Soon Tofu) and I wasn't expecting much, but I was surprised. The tofu wasn't as silky delicious as House of Soon or Buk Chang but it was a decent effort. I told the waitress that I liked it spicy and it came out super spicy with all sort of extra chillis in the broth. My only complaint is that it was served with white rice, and was a little pricier but I was decent for sure. 

My companion had a Spider Roll which was good, nothing super special but good. He enjoyed his sashimi bento, there was alot of fish, and the waitress gave me the miso and salad even though it didn't come with my meal. 

In the end it wasn't the best Japanese or Korean in the world, but it was typical Toronto standard, and really not as bad as I was expecting.

Full Bonus Star for the incredible Service. I was seriously shocked."}
{"text":"Quick lunch option along Queen W.  It's rather hard to describe this place because it's not particularly bad and not particularly good either.  It's a fusion Korean/Japanese spot and I think it's one of those Chinese owed place.  First impression is there are plenty of seats on a Friday late lunch hour.  The food is ok, obviously there are better option in the neighbourhood.  Service overall is quick and efficient.  Portion is not really sufficient for me and I will consider this more of a take out spot than dining in.  Overall 2.5/5"}
{"text":"This is one's on my take-out roll. If I don't feel like cooking, then I'll order a sashimi trio and a couple of healthy rolls (think no spicy mayo, tempura, or cream cheese), all available in natural brown rice. They're nothing special, but everything I get is freshly made and just what I ordered. It's not cheap for takeout, either, but I can still get a decent dinner for two at around $30.

Bonus points: the extra brown rice that comes with the sashimi can be saved and made into part of a later meal."}
{"text":"Very good service and have great food with lots of flavour exploding in your mouth and their is a lot of food and at am reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Chef was also handling cash without gloves. Saw him holding a phone and going back to preparing sushis without washing hands. I notified him. Afterwards, he'd only rinse them. See for yourself: no soap by the tap."}
{"text":"HoSu used to be a nice go-to lunch spot but the quality has gone down substantially since ownership changed. 

After a couple of red and yellow cards. I've steered away from this location."}
{"text":"Both times I've been I had the galbi (\"marinated shortribs\") which was about 10$ and came with a large amount of vegetables & fried shrimp on the side.  The thing I didn't like was that all the veggies (like sweet potato) were battered & deep fried just like the shrimp, which at first bite was good but after awhile it tasted way too greasy.  I loved the ribs, but the 2nd time i had them they were too salty.  I've also tried their side of kalamari which i wouldn't get again- too chewy & stringy.  Oh & the galbi also came with rice, and before your dish comes you get a bowl of soup-type stuff (sorry i forget what it was) AND a small salad. So a good amount of food for the price.  They have a really colourful menu so if i go again i would love to try something different."}
{"text":"Well.. I used to go there a lot when I lived in the neighbourhood. Foot that time was fantastic. 
My recent visit was Bad;(
First, the service was lousy. They only had one waitress working her ass off..I played half time 'looking for the waitress' game. 
Second, we had Yonge St. sushi for lunch that day. The rice was dry and the fish was not so fresh. 
Very disappointed experience, sign..."}
{"text":"Another update as Connie T's recommendation of getting Korean food vs Japanese food here seemed to make sense after having a less-than-Japanese plate of inari sushi. I went straight for the bibim bop and was not disappointed. You can get it with or without the egg but you have no choice - you must accept a load of delicious vegetables including sprouts, carrots julienne, spinach and others I can't even remember right now. Gawd. It's lunch time.

{"text":"I previously encountered cockroach incidences at both locations many years ago: a roach running around on the dining floor at Queen location and a floating one in my soup noodle at Eglinton. I had it reported to DineSafe, who later reported they had cleaned up their act.

I always loved their bibimbop so I decided to go back again last night, but encountered yet another small roach in my salad! The waitress did not look the least bit alarmed when I pointed it out to her, and only mumbled a \"sorry\" before bringing another salad, which I did not feel like eating at that point.

Strike three, Hosu. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered sashimi. I asked if the salmon was farmed or wild before ordering and the waiter had no idea what I was asking and instead replied with 'it's real salmon'. Which made me wonder.

The quantity was good for the price but I couldn't finish due to the quality. It came with some big pieces of salmon (farmed). Some whitefish which was good. The third was tuna, it was really red and didn't look right. It tasted worse, it must have gone off a few days ago. I tried to convince them it was bad as they should stop serving it (I wasn't alone in this judgement). No luck, the response was 'it was delivered today' and I can give you free ice cream (which I refused as I was eating with a group). 

Also, the sidedishes were small - what do you do with two pieces of kimchi?"}
{"text":"They just changed their menus and increased their prices significantly.  We eat there a lot and did take out there.  I use to pay for a family of four around 35 to 40 dollars.  Today paid almost $60.  They said they increased their sizes of their rolls which it was, but it's really not worth the extra $5 you pay for each roll and dish.  The waitress said they still have rolls from the previous menu but that as well the price increases by $1.50 to $2.00 for some dishes.   I recommend taking your sushi fix across the street from Hosu to Sushi Time  if you're looking for better quality sushi for the price range."}
{"text":"Today I came back here today since couples of years ago. Last time came here was not good everything. Sushi, Salad, Bento box, all of food was not fresh and taste bad. Workers were not friendly. I came back here because I thought here was change but nothing improved lol all they changed was price goes up. Hahaha I won't be here anymore see you forever"}
{"text":"I used to come to HoSu regularly when I lived in Toronto 4.5 years ago. Glad to see some things don't change. Same solid food quality, reasonable price, clean environment and friendly, prompt service.
I got the vegetarian lunch bento which has a lot of variety with tofu, noodles, tempura, sushi and salad/ miso soup. Couldn't finish it all!"}
{"text":"*This review is based only on delivery*

on any given evening when the bf & I crave for sushi, Ho Su`s menu always manages to be the top contender of the menu pile. No, it is not because of its glossy red cover or the default easy level on the menu readability.  Simply because at the end of the wash we all look for the same thing - Good food , very reasonable pricing and convenience. Reminding us of the value to Yelps conception. 

The food is delivered under 40minutes and has consistently been of good quality (considering some items contain raw ingredients). I am very particular about my avocado and I have yet to meet a discoloured avocado piece in my maki roll. For fake sushi lovers, this is a pretty big indicator as to
 a) how well the product quality is
b) even with popularity the standard of food has not faltered


our usual order :

spicy tuna maki roll - $4.95
California roll - $3.95
Sashimi appetizer - $6.95 (2tuna, 2salmon, 2whitefish)
green dragon - $8.95 cali wrapped with avocado
beef galbi - 9.95
bbq spicy chkn skewers - 2 long skewers for only $3.95

 

Here's a short story of  what happens when gluttony, adventure itching and hungry belly take over the rational side of your brain - After the 4th time of choosing this place as our usual sushi delivery , we decided to try another sushi place. Unlike Alice in wonderland, it was not a good adventure. It actually ended up a bad mistake.

Moral of the story : If it ain't broke, don't be lookin to fix it.

{"text":"This is a favorite of mine for Queen St..  I like ordering off their vegetarian sushi section and it's one of the few sushi places downtown where you can replace white rice for brown rice (for an extra charge).  They don't charge for tea.  The service and consistency of the the experience is great.  They also have decent hours during the week if you want a late dinner."}
{"text":"Rule 100 don't order Sushi at a Korean restaurant. I know the restaurant says Japanese/ Korean but the owners are Korean. So I ordered Dorsut Bibimbap (this is Bibimbap in a hot pot).  The marinated beef was decent, but the vegetables were of the wrong species. From my understanding you don't put broccoli in Bibimbap...you just don't do it.  Also more important , my wife  ordered kimchi chigae which had Yang Cabbage (non-korean cabbage). This is definitely a  no-no.  The soup in the Kimchi Chigae was actually decent but my wife said she would never go to Ho su  again.  In other words the food is edible but just not good."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 7/10
Food: 7/10
Atmosphere: 7/10
Service: 7/10

Let's put it this way. Ho Su is nothing special, but not horrible by any standard. If you're looking for basic, run of the mill sushi, service, atmosphere, you can stop by. It's conveniently located and the staff are very chill so will let you hang out for a bit."}
{"text":"I tried here on my first night moving into my apartment around the corner and ive been back a few times since! 

If im in the mood for takeout its now a toss up between here and spring roll! 
mostly i come here because it is quick, fresh and reasonably priced for a takeout! 

The meals come in a box with everything included and the tempura shrimp is lovely and light! 

It always seems to be quite busy so they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"Ordered a salmon bento box for dinner. First time here and will be my last.  The worst bento box I've ever had, not to mention the restaurant reeked of cleaning products.  The meal came with a small salad, edamame and soup which were ok. The box comes with glass noodles, rice, salmon, ONE piece of cold broccoli, COLD zucchini and bean sprouts.  Salmon was draining in Teriyaki sauce.  Meals here  are not cheap.  For the lack of taste and effort in preparation, not worth it. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located on the busiest intersection of Queen Street, Ho Su Bistro really is just a convenience. 

The food is meh, and the same goes for the presentation. It's a decent place to pick up and get on with your day. The food come out fast, probably why the presentation isn't too impressive. The sashimi did not taste too fresh, and the rolls are on the small side (I ordered the Black Dragon roll). 

Service was quick during lunch, but waitresses don't come back to check on you too often. I was without tea till she came by to bring us our order. 

The atmosphere is pretty gloomy. It was a nice sunny day outside, but their patio was full so we had to sit inside. There's barely any lighting, and with the way the restaurant is designed (narrow strip with no windows), they need to install more lighting otherwise people may have a hard time seeing what they're eating. 

This place is good choice for something quick, but certainly not for quality or gourmet sushi. There are better options in this area than Ho Su for sure, so sorry, won't be back!"}
{"text":"Hosu's is one of my favourite sushi spot on the Queen Street strip.  Food is always good and consistent.  Over the past while, they have re-branded the restaurant's menu and it has done the chain very well.  (They have a sister location by Yonge & Eglinton) 

Service is quick and attentive.  With every meal, they bring wonderful side dishes (kimchi, potato, beans and edamae (sp?)) 

Price is affordable, they have some killer lunch specials under $10.

Check out Hosu's if you are in the Queen Street West area!"}
{"text":"In general, I do like this spot but if you want authentic Korean food, definitely go to Korea town. Either in bathurst/Bloor or Yonge/finch-Steeles. Dolsot bibimpap was really good but their appetizers were salad and edamame beans, I was expecting kimchi and all these other Korean appetizers."}
{"text":"I liked the fact that this restaurant was a short walk from my hotel. Within 10 minutes and I was sitting pretty, sipping hot tea, and perusing the menu.  After 10 minutes of indecision (nothing really stuck out or screamed \"you must order me!\"), I settled on this menu: 
appetizer = edamama + sushi pizza
entree = sushi/sashimi combination

As I am new to this \"sushi pizza\" phenomenon (I don't believe SF has any places that serve this dish), I just had to try it! For those not in the know (like me), the \"dough\" part of the pizza is crispy rice, flattened in a round disc. Topped with tobiko, salmon and some kind of spicy thingy. It was cut into 6 bite-sized wedges.

Sushi pizza - 2 stars. The crispy rice was drenched in oil. Perhaps it was fried? I have no idea. I took one bite of the first wedge, tried to savor it, but couldn't bring myself to finish it. Instead, while waiting for my entree to arrive, I ended up eating all the toppings (salmon + tobiko) ... which left all the crispy rice wedges intact. Perhaps the local Torontoans love sushi pizza, but it's not my cup of tea.

The sushi/sashimi combo entree was just the ticket though! Fish was fresh and I finished most of it. 4 out of 5 stars.

Side note: what truly made my dining experience at Ho Su, though, was the neighboring table to my right. Our tables were not 4 inches apart, so I overheard their whole conversation! They were two 20-something Asian guys, who kept ogling and commenting on how cute two other diners were (who were seated at the table to my immediate left). I was soooo tempted to just turn to the guys and ask if they wanted to switch tables. LOL hilarious. I learned they were hot for those girls, they really like Matrix (\"this tastes like chicken because the Matrix tells me it tastes like chicken\"), one of them will be moving to Japan next year, and both are college boys who have exams next week."}
{"text":"Wow! I am so happy that I found a second place that has Korean veggie friendly dishes. I had the Dolsot Vegetable Bibim Bop. It was really good and I loved how they put the chap jae noodles, tofu and lots of veggies. I also had the chap jae appetizer and the vegetable gyoza. Both were really good and not oily at all. The service was quick, friendly and helpful. I look forward to coming back and trying more of their dishes. It was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"For quick eats Hosu has bento style dinner specials for around $5. For sushi, the platinum combo has spicy tuna rolls, dynamite rolls and too much for one person to finish. For Korean food, the spicy tofu stew here is my fave. It is sweaty chin and runny nose spicy! So savoury with tofu and veggies floating around in a bright red broth that you can soak up with a large portion of rice.  The sushi here is unusually fresh and the people behind the counter are speaking Japanese, I think, but not Chinese as many of the other Sushi places in town. More authentic than most, good prices."}
{"text":"Yaaaaaaaa, no. I've had take-out from here before during my lunch hours and it was very mediocre but I've never been here for just a regular sit-down meal until recently. I read the other reviews before coming here so I didn't have very high expectations and pretty much just expected mediocre food, it was a little bit below that. I ordered the Spicy Beef Soup and my friend ordered the Kimchi Soup. Neither of these dishes were spicy and they didn't come with side dishes. If you're looking for something spicy and soupy, this is not what you're looking for. If you're looking for a nice sit-down restaurant, this is probably not what you're looking for either. There are a few better places in the area. If you're looking for a quick and cheap bite? Yeah, Ho Su is ok.  I would probably not go out of my way to eat here again but it is super cheap for the amount of food so I would probably continue to do take out."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick weekend lunch and went for their lunch special menu of beef teriyaki and tempura.

The tempura was really nice, not too oily and plenty of flavour. The Teriyaki was just too chewy with the sauce trying to hide that fact.

Was not impressed by the food at all.

The restaurant itself is split in two sections separated by a narrow walkway between the kitchen.
To the front of the shop is the more claustrophobic section and to the rear is the more open cafe type seating although might possibly get a whiff from the bog if seated close enough.

For the price the food was okay, would like to try their sushi but with other options nearby it would have to be pushed to the back of the pack for now."}
{"text":"Ho Su on Yonge is a high volume lunch destination for nearby office workers seeking quick service and low prices. Customers will eat reasonably fresh food for a near-trivial amount of money and not feel empty in the stomach or the wallet. This is a convenient local kitchen and not a \"destination\" food experience."}
{"text":"I've been living down the street from Ho Su for 8 months now and only just ordered from them, and I feel like I've missed out on so much good sushi! We've been ordering from other places in the area that aren't half as good.

 Their Kamikaze roll is my favourite, I used to get it from a place in Scarborough, but since moving here hadn't found another place that sold it, till now. Plus their Inari was actually the stuffed sweet tofu pouches, as opposed to a lot of other places where it's been inari sliced in a roll, cute!

We got a ton of food for about $30 bucks, enough to stuff 2 of us with leftovers."}
{"text":"I come here with co-workers at least once a week for lunch and find it to be very reasonably priced for the quality and quantity of food.

I've ordered:

- salmon and tempura lunch which comes with teriyaki salmon, rice, coleslaw and beansprouts/carrots (I ask for extra coleslaw instead of the beansprouts/carrots), tempura (I ask for just vegetable, no shrimp), and a small miso soup and salad

- vegetable tempura lunch

- yam tempura maki and avocado-cucumber maki

- Korean omelet with vegetable fried rice

Everything I've ordered has been delicious and fresh. One thing I must add is that I miss the Make Room for Mushroom (mushrooms sauteed in garlic butter) which they removed from their menu about a year ago.

The staff is very friendly, but not ever in an in-your-face kind of way. They even remember my co-worker's complicated order without her having to go through it anymore."}
{"text":"We were directed to a table, spent 15 minutes trying to get anyone's attention, and then left and went somewhere else. No-one noticed that we left. 

The sushi on the menu wasn't inspiring (deep fried 'crab' and shrimp tempura with extra 'crab'?), and the place looks pretty grim inside. I won't be back, and won't order from them having seen the restaurant."}
{"text":"they use to be good. now, the sushi is horrible. it falls apart when you pick it up and it is tasteless. Small pieces. They went downhill in the past year or two."}
{"text":"In order for me to eat sushi, I have to really be in the mood. Unlike some people, I don't want it all the time. When I *do* want it however, I usually head to Ho Su. 

With some of the most reasonable sushi prices around town, Ho Su sits in a league of its own. Ho Su sushi is fresh and delicious and the staff does their best to be as efficient and quick as possible. I've often sat down, ordered, eaten and paid my bill all in the span of a half hour. Now that's noteworthy... especially when you're in a rush to get back to your Queen St. Shopping Spree. 

The restaurant is pretty big (it stretches out and around in the back) and I've never had to wait for a table. Plus if you work in the vicinity, the good people at Ho Su are happy to offer you a discount! 

The service is good, the sushi is great and the prices are unparallelled. 

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Hold your chopsticks folks....this place just either took new ownership or the current owner just doesn't care anymore. I just went for takeout on Saturday night. I did notice the place wasn't bustling busy as usual. Hmmmm. Should have gave in to my Spider senses. The last time I was there was a few weeks ago. I didn't recognize most of the staff. Sooo, has to be new ownership.
I ordered the beef teriyaki with rice, salad, miso soup and 10 pieces of sushi consisting of salmon, white tuna, red snapper and cucumber rolls with avocado.
  Firstly, the soup was transparent. I never say miso soup look like water with some chicken broth added and a few tofu pieces. Took one sip and almost keeled over in disgust.
  The sushi looked like the fake one you see on display in storefront windows. Except they were fucken real!! Yeah, as in real disgusting pieces of raw fish that almost made it to the cat dish.
What a frigging nightmare of a meal this place turned out to be."}
{"text":"Reading the other reviews, this place seems to inspire both adulation and loathing. Dropped by for a quick snack recently and my experience fell on the adulation side of the equation.  Great tasting sushi, creative menu, nice free apps, quick service, great prices. Not particularly fancy - you've seen the interior a million times before - but worth stopping in if you're in the neighbourhood.  My soft shell crab roll for about 7 bucks was excellent."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place.  It's my go-to for takeout sushi downtown. The sashimi is fresh and tasty. The rolls are good and as an added bonus: you can sub for BROWN RICE.  When eating in, the rice in the rolls is still warm which creates a tasty contrast with the cold fish. The Soho roll (no rice, cucumber wrapping) is also really tasty. 
Loses a star on inconsistency. There have been a few incidents where the sashimi hasn't been fresh or the order has taken too long. Also a bit expensive for the quantity."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a movie and I brought my friend here for quick bite since she was hungry and I remember they had good take out options. They still come in very generous portion with good combinations of veges and meat. I can see myself getting my lunch from here if I was working in this area. 

Then why this place is getting 2 stars from Miss grumpy ass I judge everything?

Shit hit the fan when my friend asked if she can have a sit at the bar eat her take out food there. I mean, there was a bar empty and willing with soy sauce jar on it even. Even if we are not allow to have out take out food I was expecting a little more than big fat NO with that hateful glare they had. GEE! Was just a question! She was seriously irritated and wasn't being shy letting us know that for a fact.

Some waitresses here need some serious anger management. Not a big fan of any food they serving here so I doubt I'll ever come back, but just letting you all know, no questions shall be asked in this restaurant. Esp. When servers are on PMS or whatever she was going through.

I hate you too Hosu, good bye for ever."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for sushi takeout. I have dined in on several occasions but order delivery on a weekly basis. For less than 30 bucks, my boyfriend and I get more than enough tasty food delivered to our door in typically around 40 minutes. Even on a busy Friday or Saturday night. On one occasion an item we had ordered didn't make it to us, but the staff gave us the option of them delivering it then, or taking a credit for our next order."}
{"text":"My BF and I ordered delivery from Hosu last week and I just wanted to make a note about how this restaurant really displayed the three F's.

Fast - they took the order and delivered it very fast and efficiently
Friendly- the woman who took the order was lovely. The delivery man was happy and just so great
Fresh - sometimes when I order sushi delivery, it isn't so fresh but this place delivered fresh and delicious fish.

Just passing on the awesome service and food experience I had when ordering delivery at Hosu."}
{"text":"This place is convenient to grab a bite before a movie, since it's a hop and a skip from the Scotiabank theatre. They do both Japanese and Korean dishes (I wouldn't say traditional Korean, but Korean fushion perhaps?) here, which is really convenient. The usual bento and the rolls are very good; I do particularly enjoy their special menu which outlines some of their highlight dishes. Like I mentioned before, the Korean dishes here are passable (but still enjoyable!), but something is slightly off (too sweet of a sauce, runnier than normal sauces etc.)... The best analogy that I can come up with at the moment is as if the cook learned how to make Korean food similar to someone who learned how to date by reading Cosmo articles."}
{"text":"I'd read a few reviews of the Queen St. location of Ho Su Bistro (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ho-su-bistro-toronto-2#hrid:i_t7W2_OivZgTuIpcD2qmQ/query:hosu), so when a friend suggest we try it last night, I thought it was a great opportunity to see what this Japanese/Korean restaurant was all about. 

The Yonge/Eglinton location hovers dangerously along the line between food court vendor and casual restaurant. 
Food court qualities: 
- Take-out menu of photos hang in the entrance. Traffic.
- Fountain pop machine is in plain view in the dining area. 
- The service was quick and friendly.
- Sickly, sweet teriyaki sauce.
- Small portions of the red bibimbop sauce that I love in large doses.
- Sushi pizza was disgusting.

Casual restaurant qualities:
- The service was quick and friendly.
- Edamame was served hot. 
- Comfortable dining area.
- Free red bibimbop sauce in small servings when requested.
- LLBO
- Better quality, paper-wrapped wooden chopsticks"}
{"text":"it's unclear to me how this restaurant has so many positive reviews. i was debating getting sushi express from the subway station on my way home, but decided to try Ho Su for sushi -- last time I came here I ordered Korean bimbimbap and didn't really like the gogeechang (sp??) sauce. Seriously, I shouldve just ordered from Sushi Express. The sushi was slightly warm, and didn't look fresh at all. I've read better reviews at Lola -- also a Korean/Japanese hybrid so I'll have to go there next time. Too bad-- I was hoping for a good local spot close to home. This restaurant always has people inside so I thought it was worth a shot."}
{"text":"Sushi is a scary thing. In my opinion there needs to be a level of trust with the restaurant more so than most other foods.
I dropped in for lunch on Saturday, mostly because Sushi Time across the street was full, and sat at a table for two by the sushi bar. After ordering sashimi, I heard coughing and looked up - no, I thought the chef couldn't be coughing on the sushi, and went back to my book. Yet again I heard coughing only to look  up and see him looking down and coughing (no mouth covering) onto my lunch. I said to him \"are you actually coughing on my lunch?\". He responded \"you're not happy?\".
No, i wasn't. I left five dollars to cover my diet coke and vowed to never return."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Ho Su! It has a very casual and friendly atmosphere. The workers here are really nice and efficient.  I also like how the restaurant, with maybe the exception of their washrooms, is really clean.

One of my favourite things about this place is that the menu is full of many cheap, and delicious, choices; so I usually get to have a variety of things. I'm a big fan of a number of dishes here, such as their salmon sushi pizza, spider maki, spicy scallop maki, dolsot chicken bimbim bop, ikayaki, and about a hundred more things! The only real downfall is that the quality of food here can be inconsistent.

Anyway, if you are looking for a good, cheap, and filling Japanese or Korean meal, Ho Su is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Dreadful! Ordered the Salmon bento box. Dreadful. Ridiculously small portion. Everything was cold. Never going back
Dirty cutlery given to my dining partner!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the takeout lunch specials at Ho Su and primarily the spicy bulgogi with tempura. The food is nothing spectactular but the quantity and portions are great from my experience. The main issues I have had is for a while they swapped out the glass noodles with coleslaw (not a fan) but those were back last time. They have also increased the price quite a bit from the early days which is unfortunate but I understand that as you need to still make money.

Definitely worth a try for lunch if you work in the area."}
{"text":"Wow, this was genuinely terrible food. I ordered through Uber Eats as my boys have been going through a noodle phase and love everything noodles. I ordered the following as I thought they were pretty safe choices.
- Yaki Udon. Very salty with uneven cuts of veggies of which some were partially cooked and came sopping in a \"soup\" of sauce that filled a quarter of the container. Let me tell you, there is nothing worse than stir fried noodles where the noodles are drippy in pure soya sauce.
- Steak Teriyaki. Similar where the meat was very tough, the rice came overcooked and soggy and sopping in sauce and again, most of the veggies were unevenly chopped and were still raw.

Most of the food ended up being inedible - what a shame!"}
{"text":"I've been to three different Ho Su locations when there were three available. I think they are down to two now. Unfortunately, it was their best location that closed but of the remaining two, this location is the better of the two. 

Ho Su is a Korean/Japanese restaurant where you can get decent sushi and good bibimbap all in one meal. Their food is above average but doesn't particularly shine too brightly but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this location to most people looking for a decent dinner out.

Although it's been a while since I've been back, they did have one standout dish that was not only amazing but one in which I have never found available at any other restaurants. It's called Kam Pong Gi. It is basically a Korean version of General Tso chicken but way better! A bit of google research shows that the traditional Korean name for the dish is GAN POONG GI, but I swear I've found it VERY difficult to find this dish at other Korean restaurants around the city.

If you find yourself in the area, Ho Su is a decent option to consider."}
{"text":"Over the years, I have been to three different Ho Su locations back when three still existed. Unfortunately the best of the three closed and of the two remaining, this location is not the better choice. 

Ho Su is a Korean/Japanese restaurant and I would have probably given is a 3 star rating but simply knowing that the other remaining location is better, I couldn't bring myself to really recommend this place. 

If you are not too picky, happen to find yourself in the area and are really itching for Korean options, then you'll probably find this place pretty ok in the moment. If it's Japanese you're after, then there are better places in the area that you can move on it."}
{"text":"I only go here because they are close to my place. The reviews are true, this place isn't consistent. I always order a korean tofu soup there because it's the only place in the area I can get it. It annoys me that this soup averages $6 everywhere else but 9 bucks here and it's not as good. If you ask for extra tofu they charge you a $1 and I never see any Extra in it. 
Last time I picked up, the woman tried to give me the completely wrong order. When I corrected her and said I wanted the spicy tofu soup she said oh ok. Didn't even apologize just re-entered it into the system and made me wait another 20 mins. When I finally got it, I walked away and realized she charged me for the original order which was more than my soup. She didn't even bother to check and give me the difference back. I was so annoyed I just left.
I really value customer service and this place has none of it."}
{"text":"The service was a bit disorganized because there were quite a few diners all ordering different combos. The soup and salad was standard but my beer came out after my meal did. I just found it amusing. The food was pretty good for the price- I got the Queen St sushi combo and it was filling. My friend got the fried chicken and seemed to like it."}
{"text":"Chicken teriyaki bento box for dinner (contains two pieces of shrimp tempura, a bit of salad, some decent teriyaki, rice and rice noodles w/ bean sprouts) and comes with miso soup. I also ordered yam maki on the side. Food was good ($25 post-tax/tips by the way), but service - now that was excellent!!!! Aside from the generous portions of the dinner bento, there was also more to enjoy than I had ordered... as I received complimentary vegetable tempura! Two pieces yam, one piece of broccoli and one piece of eggplant, might I add :) I had been debating about ordering yam tempura before so I was definitely pleased! I am generally not a miso fan so I gave my mom my miso but now I wish I at least tried it because she said it was great! If you're ordering on Foodora you may find that you have to order certain items with brown rice (or at least that was the case with me) - I ordered everything with brown rice (#sortofhealthy) which added $3-4 to my cost but made me feel slightly better about buying a humongous dinner.

I should mention that the portion size is really large and I had plenty left over for lunch the next day :D"}
{"text":"Amazing fast delivery and the food is hot and so good full of flavor!!!! I got chicken udon and my roomie ordered sushi gonna go Finnish eating it now new fav place!!!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood Japanese restaurant that also serves some Korean dishes. The price is good and have great lunch specials and bento boxes. I had a sashimi and California roll bento box and the food is pretty good although I'm not a sushi connoisseur. Staff was pretty friendly. Good place to grab a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Ugh.  I used to come here years ago and my impression of this place was never really good.  So I stopped going.  Whenever my friends suggested sushi on Queen Street W, I'll say, 'Crispy Roll!' http://www.yelp.ca/biz/crispy-roll-toronto#hrid:AUB_dxKeEyUr3VYoX2iNlw, which is just down the street and has rarely disappointed.  The other night, just to try something different, I came here again with a fellow yelper who raved about this place being inexpensive and good.  I wish I hadn't listened!

Service was OK.  The food was sup-par.  There were some snacks that came with the meal - edaname, soy beans, kimchi, some spicy potato thing.  We shared the maki sushi platinum combination (6 pieces each of california, spicy salmon and dynamite maki) and a separate maki order where the rice layer was too thick and mushy, the seaweed texture was that of something that's been sitting around too long and had soaked up too much liquid, and the tempura shrimp in the dynamite roll had too much batter and lacked any crunch.  Nothing looked or tasted particularly fresh.  

Sigh.  My stomach, taste buds and wallet are all sad that I wasted precious calories, time and money on this place.  Sigh.

Credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"Just a warning.  This review is totally personal and the food here is not those \"you must try it in your life type\", thus minus one star.  I do love their tempura though.  The sauce is great.  as good as it was ten years ago.  I feel that they just refill the same container day after day.  Thats how great taste comes from.  Like aging cheese or using bacteria to make wine.  Yes i know nothing about cheese and wine, and this place is just like that.  Not serving special fish or authentic sushi.  But fill you with wholesome food before or after you go to the gym or to cinema.
The service here is good too.
Yum... just ate a piece of yam tempura.  I do like it.  It is personal but i like it.
One last point about this place is that its not too busy that you cant get a table."}
{"text":"Would have given it a 2.5*...but rounded it up to 3. 

The portions are pretty big, the food is ok (pre-cooked, hence it's so 'fast') and takeout was affordable.

However, the bulgogi was a little tough, not tender at all...seems like it might have been sitting out for a while. 
And i asked for Brown rice, but was given white rice...boo

The tempura shrimps were pretty tasty but a little soggy and cold. But thankfully, tastier than the shit they claim as tempura shrimps at Sushi Supreme (read review there)

Will come back to try other dishes...perhaps the soon tofu. Hopefully, it'll taste better"}
{"text":"I've had food from this place for a couple dozen times. Almost always for take-out, so I'm not sure if that affects the quality of the meal.

The amount of meat has decreased over-time, and some of the dishes that advertise meat (such as the udon noodle soup) have at best a few small pieces.

I would go with the bento boxes that come with tempura shrimp and veggies. $13.50 for a box with rice, bean sprouts, and your choice of chicken/beef/salmon. However, the meat may be undercooked, which is a problem.

I've tried various appetizers, and most of them were underwhelming.
Rolls and sashimi options weren't particularly wowful either, given their price.

Oh, and expect bean sprouts. Lots of bean sprouts."}
{"text":"I have mainly ate at the location near Yonge/Eglinton but I don't work up there anymore. So I frequent the Queen St. West location now. I don't eat sushi but this is my favourite restaurant in the city for their chicken teriyaki and veggie tempura. 

They have a mix of Japanese and Korean foods on the menu. The staff are always pleasant. The food is usually hot and fresh. 

Sadly this past visit my veggie tempuras were almost raw. But my rice, chicken and veggies were great! The shrimp tempura was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I love Ho Su. I've eaten here on multiple occasions and it's always been pretty good. The service isn't amazing, it's actually not great, but there's nothing horribly bad about it either. 

When I've eaten at Ho Su, I've tried the bento boxes, the sushi/sashimi, and the bulgogi. In terms of flavor, everything was pretty good. 

The bento box was your standard bento box, but they do give you the tiny dishes in the beginning- something that not all sushi joints do. I just really enjoy the tiny soy beans that are in some type of sweet savory sauce. Not sure what it is, but it's like crack drizzled all over soy beans... YUMMY.

I've also tried the sushi/sashimi love boats. Fish was pretty fresh to me. One thing that I am very critical of is the salmon. I find that a lot of places cheap out on the cut of salmon that they give you. At Ho Su, I've never had a cheap cut of salmon. The salmon is always very pink and bright for the most part- no white parts= salmon belly= fat=the cheap stuff.

Bulgogi was good as well. Don't have much to say about it.

The place can get pretty cramped because it is a small restaurant, but it's still pretty good. Prices are also great for the quantity that you get. I can't finish the bulgogi, even if I were to share it with my boyfriend, but it's still so cheap. Gotta love cheap eats!"}
{"text":"I use to like hosu but found the quality went down fast

odd pieces of meat and small sushi was the main reason i decided to try sushi time across the street, its cheaper and you get tons more food too. check out the lunch specials there instead"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come to Hosu for a long time, but have never had the chance!  Upon entering I heard one of the waitresses speaking Mandarin - I was a bit surprised I always thought the staff would be Korean.
Their menu is extensive, consisting of Korean and Japanese fare.
I had a Korean chicken for 8.95.  I was surprised it came with a miso soup, salad, complimentary appetizers, and a huge bento box - consisting of japchae, carrots, bean sprouts, rice, chicken, and cole slaw.
Other people were having bibimbap, which was the largest portion I had ever seen for 9.95.  

The food is quite good, the portions are massive, and the staff are quite competent and friendly.
I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"No where near as good quality as their queen St location. 
No banchan, which is unfortunate because I enjoyed that part when I used to go to the Queen St place. 

Their sushi is decent, not mind blowing, the kampongi is still probably their best dish, and I had no complaints about their galbi."}
{"text":"came here for friend's bday with a group of 20 people.

at the beginning we were seated at two different tables but they allowed us to move some tables around and stay all together as a group. koodos to that.

another great thing is that they did bring separate bills to all of us and there was no gratuity included! whoa!

great service overall and a perfect place for huge loud crazy groups!"}
{"text":"Had the lunch special of chicken bibimbop. Came with complementary Miso soup and small salad. Food was excellent. Chicken very very tender. Service was fine and unobtrusive. Would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a decent sushi place in Queen St. West then this is good but if you are comparing it to the rest of Toronto then you could definitely do better.  I went here with my mom and we were seated at the rear of the resto and you could hear great buzzing noise, possibly from a generator of some sort.  We ordered sushi and sashimi, soft shell crab and green onion beef rolls.  The fish tasted fresh, which was a good thing because all the other stuff missed the mark somehow with what I have come to expect.  The soft shell crab tasted flat and watery while the beef rolls were tough and leathery.  We also ordered the spider roll, which was again very mediocre in taste and filling.  It did not wow me or give me a great feeling after eating at this place.  It is not a bad place but it is just not good enough for the quality of food that I got.  If I were you I would definitely try to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I go here with a good friend for dinner once a month, and we get bibimbap. It comes with miso and a bit of salad, and we drink bottomless cups of green tea.

It's a crazy cheap meal (like $15 each with tax and tip) and the bowls are hot, full, and super tasty. Service is what I've come to expect in spots like this (you are served by 2 or 3 different very busy people that you have to be a little pushy to flag down, whatever, just holler) but for us, it's the perfect thing.

You can usually find street parking somewhere around here in the evenings, which is good as well."}
{"text":"Ho Su is better than I remembered.  We were tucked in a quiet table at the back, which I really liked - the front can be hectic.  Service was sweet but a little inefficient - three of the mains arrived about  5 mins earlier than the remaining two, and sauce for the tempura didn't arrive until most of us were almost done with it, but it was probably due to volume; even on a Wednesday night, Ho Su was hopping. 

On the flip side, a small problem with a meal (an enterprising spider wafted from somewhere and landed on my rice) got us a gratis round of ice cream, and our server was really lovely. 

Most of us got the bento box, with or without California roll; the rolls were moist and had a nice texture contrast.  My salmon teriyaki was small, but tender and not oversweet.  The tempura was good, and I loved the miso and the vinagery-sweet salad. They keep a nice selection of Japanese bottled beer, and have some domestics at a good price.  

I sometimes complain about the selection of restaurants at Y&E -  I'm glad to have this one back on my list."}
{"text":"Came here today for a late afternoon lunch. Honestly, this wasn't my first option since there's so many other places to dine at in the surrounding area. My friend was starving and refused to venture around so we ended up here.
For the money that you pay, the food was just ok.
Would I be back? The truth is, no.
I'd rather go to other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Zero stars! The food arrived two hours late and they forgot our rice, the soup was cold and no liquid bc the noodles and kimchi soaked up all the liquid.  Not that tasty, I'd rather eat $0.05 ramyun."}
{"text":"4.5 would be my ideal rating for Ho Su.

A sushi restaurant that looks fancy, serves up great food, but still within a reasonable price range. A disadvantage however is that there usually is a line up during peak times (which should mean people like it right?). It's got a very convenient location if you are to catch a show or movie in the area. 

The food is better than your average sushi for the price range of about $15. And they do the simple things right for example, putting an effort into the generic salad you get (if you order a set or combo) and they also provide you with a nice assortment of snacks (I'm not familiar with all their names though, but there are around 6 different types from edamame to spiced cabbage).
The food like I said is very good and this is my #1 choice of venue for sushi around this area.

The staff are generally friendly, but during peak times, you can see that they are rushing quite a bit."}
{"text":"Like some one else here said, it's progressively getting worse. Service is slow, and sometimes i got attitude from the main girl up front. She should not put on make up while there are customers waiting! I was not impressed. It was also closed down a few times due to sanitization issues. I don't think I will be going there again."}
{"text":"It's a good place to pass the time while waiting for a movie near ScotiaBank, but otherwise nothing special."}
{"text":"No more 507!!!?! New menu!!!? Your 507 fed me and my friends on a weekly basis for years. Sadly you just lost quite a lot of business. 
Now it will cost $17 before tax to have your korean chicken in a bento box??
Bring back the 507! I'm so sad!"}
{"text":"We moved to Toronto from the states recently and have been trying every restaurant up and down Yonge and Englington. Because of the just ok rating of HoSu on Yelp we held off trying it. I'm glad we finally did! First of all the waitress was very nice and helped us with the menu - we wanted the Korean side. She encouraged us to get the rice, beef, egg dish served in the hot stone bowls. It was so good and so filling! (I actually got the chicken and hubby got the beef. Both very flavourful.) It comes with a salad and miso soup. All for $30!! If you've eaten around Yonge and Englington you know you aren't getting a whole lot of food for that price. For what it is, I loved HoSu and it will definitely be one of my casual night out staples."}
{"text":"Good food.  Too bad they just raised their lunch specials.  Not sure I'll bother with this place if I have to spend more money though.  Lots of other options in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"After reading some decent reviews, I decided to try this place considering my 2nd office is right next to it.  

I went with a co-worker and she had a chicken dolsot bibimbap and I had the beef dolsot bibimbap.  I also ordered kamikaze sushi which had tempura bits, spicy mayo, avocado and some other stuff. It was basically a veggie sushi roll.

While not authentic Korean, the food was very filling as both our bibimbap's had a boatload of rice, meat, sliced carrots, spinach and very nicely cooked egg where the yolk will spill and ooze onto the rice.  Yummy.  

In addition, the meal also came with edamane, miso soup and salad.  All the apps were standard and did the job.

The total for all this food was $30 tax in for two people. Not bad.  I didn't really need to order the sushi roll, but I wanted to try it.  

So why only 3 stars? 
a) This is more Japanese than Korean because there was no banchan (no kimchi, tofu, potatoes)

b) The hot sauce wasn't Korean hot.  It tasted like it was \"Canadian-ized\".  


Do I like this place? Yes. Would I go out of my way to visit this place? No. 

Would I come back? Yes, if I'm in the area. Decent value, good food."}
{"text":"I had the dynamite maki & spicy salmon maki lunch and it was pretty good and filling. It was not a particularly memorable sushi lunch, but it helped ease my sushi cravings and was pretty good for just $9.50. When I went, the restaurant was being renovated so it was a bit hard to find as it was covered in these wooden board things, and had just a white sign indicating that it was still open and there. My friends walked passed it several times while we were looking for a place to stop for lunch.
It's a pretty small place, so don't bring a huge group, but it's a pretty good place to grab a nice lunch if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love bibimbop. The first time I ate non-homemade bibimbop was at Ho Su, and I was a bit disappointed but decided it was not Ho Su's fault, it was my Korean friends who just set the bar too high! I tried their special beef bibimbop for the second time tonight and it seemed to taste better tonight - I completely attribute this to my bar being substantially lowered form the last time, which gave Ho Su an andvantage. 

Each time I have ordered this dish something very peculiar has happened. The first time a few months ago the girl packaged our meals and sent us on our way but forgot to include the soup and salad that comes with the special. We asked her about it, she said we didn't order the special, we pointed out that we did, she apologized and gave us the sides. Tonight the same thing happened - but this time the girl claimed the special didn't come with the sides...so we left and checked the board outside again and, in fact, it said the combo came with soup and salad for $7.95. We went back in and pointed out the signage and she reluctantly gave us our sides. 

The food is ok, and the price is ok, but just make sure you get what you ordered. They seem to be interested in scamming you out of your soup and salad! Nobody scams me outta my miso and veg! Nobody."}
{"text":"I have read the good reviews for this restaurant in Yelp so my hubby and I tried it last Sunday night.  I was quite surprise how affordable this place is considering that the food was delicious and excellent.  Keep an eye on the Specials board and you'll surely save more.

We ordered the dolsot chicken bibimbop and the chicken teriyaki bento box. The servings are big that it was a struggle to walk home after. 

The appetizers that they serve are good as well. I am now a fan of the nuts in sweet sauce (don't know the name) that they served with the salad, edamame and kimchi.

The only bad comment that I have is that the shrimp tempura seems too oily.  It taste like it was fried several hours before it was served.

We will surely be back. We have to taste their sushi and sashimi next time."}
{"text":"Yes, it's cheap - but you get what you pay for. I had been before for take-out, and it was pretty decent, so I went for lunch today and picked up a bento box with tempura. The shrimp used in the tempura was not cleaned properly, and there was still poop in the intestine/chute. Disgusting!

Also, the rest of the food tasted like it had been sitting there for a while. 

I would find another place. Cheap food is cheap for a reason!!"}
{"text":"it cost me $8 and I had a very satisfying lunch.  I ordered the beef bibibap and it came with the usual korean side dishes.  yummy and flavorful.  kim chee at local eats tend to be hit and miss because it depends on the batch.  but the batch i had was delicious, spicy enough to give my palette a nice zing.  

the bibibap was so filling, i loved the julienne (match cut) carrots.  there was also spinach and a whole lot more veggies in the dish, which was a delightful surprise.  in this economy, this place is definitely worth every dollar."}
{"text":"So disappoint of the spicy beef soup... I thought it will be like Korean pork bone soup, even it is not, it shouldn't be like left over dish.. 10 small pieces of beef that cited in wrong way, makes it become so chewy. Tons of onion, a bit of egg and a few bean sprout..  the body of the soup is just pepper, oil and water! Hell that's not a soup and it cost almost 10 dollars!
Sushi is like a piece of fish on a huge rice ball.. You can barely taste the fish.."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here before seeing a movie. The service was very quick and the food was fantastic. I had some tempura, some sushi rolls and one of their Korean chicken dishes. All the food was amazing. The only negative I could say was that the place isn't huge so the tables are closer together then normal, but this is a minor issue."}
{"text":"i'm torn about this one. 
i love the restaurant and go often. the food is delicious. 
BUT every time I go, i say i'll never go back, because i always feel slightly sick afterwards. i think they must PACK their food with MSG. which it why it tastes so darn good. but also gives me the poops and toots. lol, did i just say that?! it's true."}
{"text":"The portions have decreased considerably over the years and the amount of meat they give you. The quality of the sushi is low."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years but was extremely disappointed with my meal today.  Portion size was ridiculously small and included potato salad. Still scratching my head over that one. 

It's sad because I always look forward to getting take out from ho su when I come into the city but won't be returning again."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in the city. They do it right here. The lunches are insanely affordable and quality eats!

I usually enjoy a bento box, but recently had sushi and it was killer, also the miso soup is addictive, saki  on the side and now we're talkin.

Great service and prices are great.

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The sushi here is not that great; I find the rice to non-rice ratio wacked. That being said, whenever I come here, I eat a Korean entry. This is probably your safest bet as it is it run by Koreans. :)

The service is pretty good. Staff is pleasant enough and the food comes quickly."}
{"text":"This is a staple of the Yonge/Eglinton workers who would frequent it in flocks.  It was always my first choice when a coworker asked \"Where do you wanna go for lunch?\".

First off, lunch is cheap.  Great variety of bento boxes ranging from sashimi to sushi to bulgogi to tempura to pretty much anything Japanese or Korean (ok, maybe not that much variety).  $7-12 will get you a crazy amount of food.  The tempura is the best I've ever had -- big, fluffy, and light batter.  Very unique, no idea how they prepare it to make it different.

My favorite is the Korean chicken (spicy and sweet chunks of chicken, mainly dark meat) with tempura bento box.  Best $9 meal in the area in my opinion.

Only went there for dinner once, which is obviously more expensive, but equally as delicious.  Lunch is much better in terms of value.  Oh yeah, pick-up at lunch is even cheaper!"}
{"text":"The inside has more seating than it looks like from the outside, so don't be fooled. Beware of coming on warmer days, as it seems like the air conditioning inside is never fully on (it was quite warm when I came, and the interior of the restaurant reflected that). However, the service was quick and friendly, and the portion sizes were quite large. I had the beef bibimbap and I wasn't able to finish it. Taste wise, it was pretty standard, but they definitely didn't skimp on the beef! Prices were also pretty low considering it's on Queen West."}
{"text":"Used to love this place- my boyfriend and I used to go there once a week for out lunch break.  Then we started seeing cockroaches.

We were sitting at the back and one was running along the railing (in the raised seating area) and almost ran onto my boyfriend.  

Another time one fell from the ceiling and landed on the table.

The food was good, but after that I cannot bring myself to EVER go back.  Wont happen."}
{"text":"It's just ok. Took one of my interns for a lunch and the bentos are nothing spectacular.  The service is ok too with a lot of quasi-Korean and Japanese food."}
{"text":"I wanted to give it 2 stars but I give these guys the benefit of the doubt because we were there quite late (about 45 minutes before closing time). NOT that it should be an excuse for poor food.
Anyways, the first indication of an average experience was the miso shiro soup-very lukewarm and not inspiring to move forward at all.
My wife had the korean bibimbop vegetarian dish and it was decent, hot, lots of yummy tofu and good flavour.
I had the salmon bento box with tempura and some california rolls and it was just average. the salmon was ok, the california rolls were fine but the tempura was just not great at all.
You think a bento box is such a basic thing so how can you screw it up?
I guess you can.

So, yes, it's not that bad but honestly there are so many great options around that you can do better."}
{"text":"In the context for what this place is, I think it is pretty good.

I never expected this place to be high end with chefs trained in Japan by highly-regarded sushi masters working in Michelin-star restaurants or having competed in the Iron Chef.

What I expect is a place with fair prices ($9-$15), tastes like what it says it is on the menu and won't make you sick because they get a decent turnover of customers. And that's what I get.

I usually go there for their lunch specials and always finish my meal with my stomach fulfilled. The quality and taste aren't going to blow away the competition but they offer their dishes at a great value in terms of price and quantity. The food is fresh and pretty good so I always feel like my money was well-spent. In addition, their menu is quite extensive and probably offer more variety than the other sushi places nearby.

Yes, they do have Korean items on the menu but offering dishes that are non-Japanese seem to be par for the course for mid-range sushi restaurants in the GTA.

The service is pretty good and you won't be waiting too long as you place your order. They are pretty efficient. So if you're in the area, feel like sushi and not sure which one to try, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"SUSHI CHEF WENT TO BATHROOM AND DID NOT WASH HIS HANDS AFTER HE WAS DONE!!!!!!!!! and no, this is not made up... I wish it was as I USED to go there rather often . F%&# gross!! STAY AWAY! I guess he didn't see me as I was in the stall but I could see him. (I'm 6'4\" and can see over the top of the stall)  Messed up!!! I saw him later at the sushi bar making sushi! Yup!!! I almost lost my dinner right there and then.

I told the manager after because I was so grossed out and she acted like it was no big deal!!!! WTF? DO NOT EAT HERE! There are so many options around so steer clear of Ho Su Bistro!!"}
{"text":"Went after work to celebrate coworker's birthday.
Nice little cozy place, they didn't seem to have that much seating, but when we got there it was empty so that wasn't an issue.  I ordered some maki, and co-workers stuck with the Korean food.
Their spicy salmon roll was quite good, but nothing out of the ordinary; I have yet to find a spicy salmon roll to even come close to the one from Lola Sushi.  Their fish quality was fresh, and wasn't cold, which is nice (as apparently sushi is supposed to be eaten at room temperature) .  I did order a fire volcano roll which was a regular maki with salmon and imitation crab, which I found to be lacking and also expensive for what was in it.  
I was also able to taste some of the Korean food.  I don't know the name of the dish, but it was similar to sweet and sour chicken. That tasted quite nice, had a good kick to it.
Overall experience was average, I wouldn't come back just because I'd like to try many other places in Toronto"}
{"text":"The prices are relatively inexpensive and the staff are always accommodating and polite. It's a shame that the quality of the rolls and bento boxes have gone downhill."}
{"text":"Great food, quick service. Yet the waitress was barely seen. They may need to get more wait staff, other then that everything was great! Definitely would go again. The setting was also nice, since I was on a date it's nice to have a candlelit sushi dinner :)"}
{"text":"WARNING: Someone who works here is likely skimming credit card numbers. BEWARE."}
{"text":"good, cheap korean and japanese food. the takeout menu is really cheap and grange park nearby is a great place to have a \"picnic\"... eat-in prices are still less than most restaurants and the waitstaff is pretty attentive. spring for the white meat chicken for the teriyaki, it's worth the extra fee. and don't bother with the dumplings, they're not very good."}
{"text":"Quality, price, and delivery time A1. If you're in the downtown core and looking for a late night bite, I HIGHLY recommend ho su. The large kam pong gi is allllways a must order. They serve it in a large styrofoam container, which seals the moisture, but does not make the dish soggy. The fried chicken is crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside and is served with juuust the right amount of sauce. It's a large serving and definitely good for two, and then some. All takeout/delivery meals are also served with salad and miso soup (which isn't HOT, but still WARM when it arrives at your door)."}
{"text":"Don't know why ho-su has gotten less than average ratings. The only concern I have with them is the service; you got to wave them down when you want something, even if it's just to refill your water glass. The food here is good, portions well worth the price. I usually come here for lunch with pops (peek the pic of my go-to order). The galbi lunch is delish, though they've chinced on the meat as opposed to the heefty servings in the past. The meat is well marinated and not tough to chew. I also like to substitute my carrots/bean sprouts for glass noodles (free of charge). Spacious venue, and would recommend if you're looking for cheap lunch specials around yonge and eg."}
{"text":"First, found lipstick marks on the miso soup bowl. Then, was served uncooked chicken of Bim Bim bop. Waitress asked if I just wanna order something or heat it! Never return"}
{"text":"Got takeout from here via \"Just eat\". Was not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by both the quantity and the quality. I ordered the dolset chicken bibimbap, and beef bulgogi. This was more than enough for two people. The meat was cooked to perfection (would go with the chicken over the beef)  The egg and vegtables were fresh on the top. Would get again, everything flavourful and good quality."}
{"text":"Came here for take out on a lunch break, and the service was fast and VERY affordable. I ordered a chicken terriyaki/shrimp tempura take out box and the portion was generous to say the least. Perfect if you're in the mood for decent Japanese/Korean on a tight schedule."}
{"text":"Definitely without a doubt of the more reliable lunch spots in the area- an easy favourite!. The place really delivers on its value in terms of food quality and reliable service. I tend to get the Bento Box for lunch with either Beef Teriyaki and Kalbi and I found the latter to be especially flavorful and tender. For their Sushi however, I found them to be just average - although they set the price low enough that I don't think any Sushi eater could have anything to complain."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time with my best friend because another friend had recommended it. Its really cheap and you get a lot of little goodies before you main meal if you order the bento box. I always get the teriyaki chicken box. I love tempura and it includes that and a few other things (cant remember now) Overall i like the food. I mean you get what you pay for. I always sit in the far back because its quieter and hidden from the rest of the place which i like. 

The one thing though that totally turns me off if the fact that my girlfriend (who originally raved about this place and told me to go there) ate there for lunch and saw a cockroach crawling on the wall. She immediately left and has never gone back since. Admittedly i have gone a few times since, but i am always looking around the walls lol"}
{"text":"The place looks really cool and is usually pretty busy but the food is not very good. I didn't try any of the korean foods so I can't comment on that but we had the sushi, teryaki, bento boxes and neither were that spectacular. I was pretty disappointed with the sushi (rice wasn't fresh and near dry - sushi pieces were huge with not much in the middle, mostly just rice - although they were made sturdily). The tempura was waaayyy too deep fried and greasy and for the FIRST time in over 30+ bento boxes, I refused to eat all my tempura.

The prices are not bad, pretty standard for japanese eat in's and the service is good but damn I wish the food was better."}
{"text":"Although the person who reviewed this restaurant previously gave Ho Su Bistro only 2 stars, I have to say my experience at Ho Su were completely the opposite!

I guess I have been lucky when it comes to my dining experiences at this restaurant.

I really enjoy Ho Su for some great Japanese dining. Although some of their sushi rolls are not in the same league as ones I have tried at other sushi houses, they do offer some great options.

Here are some of my favourites:

- Smoked salmon roll
- Chicken Teriyaki bento box
- Ko Pang Gi Chicken (Spicy chicken with flavourful seasoning)

Overall, Ho Su is a smaller restaurant which offers a friendly and intimate setting. From what I have sampled so far, I am happy with this restaurant and would recommend it to anyone look for a bite as a long walk, a day at work or shopping in the Yonge and Eglinton area.

They also have a location on Queen Street, across the street and one block down from the CTV (old MuchMusic) building."}
{"text":"The food here is ok. I come here a lot because it's convenient. 

They don't use sesame oil. For me sesame oil is a main ingredient in Korean food.

They also don't serve kimchi with each dish, also another main ingredient in Korean food. 

Otherwise, food quality is good and prices are reasonable.

It's not really authentic Korean or Japanese. If you want authentic Korean, then just take the Yonge subway up to Sheppard or North York Centre."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people in Toronto are so picky about sushi. This place has dam good food for the price. I have eaten at least 20 different places in TO for sushi and this has been definitely one of the most consist ant places. I have had an average experience here one or 2 times out of many times. The service is fast and friendly. The rolls are of good portion with a lot of fish. The lunch specials are very good. This place is way above average. This is not Nobu nor should it be compared to a place where yo have drop 80 bucks a person. 20 bucks can get you a special you can split between 2 people and be stuffed. Fresh, Fast, Friendly. That is what you get. The only reason I do not give 5 stars is that most combos come with a Calf. roll."}
{"text":"I've been many times and usually had a good experience. The only times I've not enjoyed myself is when I've been seated in the little room. I feel the waitresses never pay as much attention as they should to that area. 

Other than that, the food has always been good and prompt, and the waitress are always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Terrible.    I saw the cook drop a piece of fish on the dirty floor, took a quick look around and put it back on the plate no issues.    Honest truth no lie.  
Disgusting.  Avoid this place unless you don't mind tasting his shoes with your meal."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite sushi spots in the city. I definitely like the fact that you get free little appetizers when you order, which is something a lot of sushi places don't seem to do. I tend to stick to the maki combinations and I have never been disappointed. The service is always bang-on and friendly."}
{"text":"Been one of my favourites for sushi take out in the city for a long time.  The sushi is always fresh, portions are good, great sized portions, great value. Always have a great experience when I order from them."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a large menu of sushi and other Japanese type food. The selection I had (Fire Mountain, Giant Maki, Red Dragon, and Crazy Maki) were not the best I tried. The restaurant doesn't have a good decoration setting, the restrooms were dirty with no paper towel and disappointing. The servers are attentive and nice. Overall the food is good but not my favorite."}
{"text":"This is Canadian Korean.

And it is just fine.

While I prefer my Asian restaurants to have more exotic strange stuff on the menu,

I can't argue with superlative execution - and Ho Su has superlative execution.

Their tempura is addictive. While the giant sweet potato rounds are my favorite - their broccoli and plain old potato tempura is just fine ...

and - yes - plain potato tempura done right will make you forget about battered french fries forever.

The red soups are firey hot - which is the way they were supposed to be before other Korean restaurants started nerfing them for North American tastes.

The red soups here also have a fine underlying broth before the fire goes in so you can taste the seafood or meat that went into the original construction.

Noodles are fine. 

Vegetarian sushi is particularly good. 

Cucumber roll which is a throw away item in most places with an old tasteless cucumber being empty spacer for rice -  and essentially a blob of bulk to be dipped in soy sauce - -  here really tastes like cucumber.

Cucumber is supposed to be light, refreshing and have the cuke taste that makes up the basis of cucumber bar drinks.

This sushi has it. Most other sushi places that serve cucumber (i.e. nearly all of them) don't deliver any vegetable quality

I would not drive forty miles to eat at Ho Su.

But if this place was in my neighborhood - it would be a go to place for reliable simple Korean comfort food.

{"text":"For many years, Ho Su has remained a safe bet for a dependable Japanese dinner. However, it was not until last night before heading to a late movie at the SilverCity on Dundas, that I could bring myself to up this place into the 4 star threshold.

For the most part this restaurant is a 3.5*....the downtown location on Queen is now a 4* in my books. I am always a fan of the Dolsot Chicken Bibim Bop with its huge portion including soup and salad, and great assortment of marinated chicken, cooked veggie and topped with a fried egg. The beef Bulgogi is another yummi choice, and if your hungry, you can go wrong with the Bento box choices. Though admittedly the teriyaki sauce is a tad sweet and thick to be SUPER authentic it is really effin tasty.

The main difference btwn this location is the little korean appetizers they provide before the meal. A small plate of edamame, a couple scoops of soy beans, and some kimchi, and spicy potatoes. 

What launched this location to the next level however, was its delivery of SUPER fresh and delicious tasting Sashimi and maki last night. It was among the best I had ever had.

The Chirachi is a STEAL for $9.95 (1pc octopus, 2pc sweet shrimp, 3pc imitation crab, 2pc tuna, 2pc salmon, 2pc butterfish)...but for the quality served up last night it was a bit of a trip.

The dynamite was good for $4.95 and the Toronto Maki was amazing and fresh!
You bet yo sweet bippy I'm headed to Ho Su the next time I have a sashimi craving and only a 20 in my pocket!"}
{"text":"3.7*** I can't give this place a 4 simply because it is not high end. However, if your looking for a huge bento box for a cheap price the this is the place. Not in the mood for teriyaki chicken, tempura, and a Cali roll? Go for the the Dolstot Bibim Bap. I get the chicken one and it comes with soup and salad (which IMO is revoltingly vinegary). The chicken is marinated and sweet, the veggies are abundant, and there is a fried egg on top. Sweet hot sauce is provided on the side for those who want an extra kick. The sushi is decent but nothing special. Anyways good location and great place to grab a big hot meal for cheap. If your a fan, visit the queen street location. It is much more lively and serves complimentary little appetizers."}
{"text":"This is an OK place for lunch, but do not bring your date there, the food is at best average.

The owners changed twice in the recent years, and the quality went down. 
Their sushi is mediocre, but Korean dishes are fine. 
Service is average for Toronto (hit and miss), waitresses do not speak English well. 

Portion size is inconsistent from visit to visit, potato tempura is often undercooked."}
{"text":"I've always liked coming here, but what really compelled me to write this review is the customer service. I had a cute waitress who was very nice. I asked what the special was and she warned me that the meal is smaller than normal priced meals. I went for regular price salmon teriyaki bento that came with a bunch of side dishes, salad, miso soup, rice, japchae, broccoli, vegetables, and coleslaw. Suffice to say, it was well worth the price.

Like I said before, the customer service was excellent. The waitress even chased me down the street as I forgot my backpack at the restaurant. I was very impressed to see that level of caring and attention to detail here in Toronto. Thanks for the great food hosu and thank you very much to the cute waitress girl for all your help."}
{"text":"I found a cockroach in my meal today. So there's that. 

I've been ordering from them a lot over the past few months but I'm generally not a huge fan of cockroaches in my food so I'll probably stay away from that place for a while."}
{"text":"First off, I should note that the reason I'm giving this place three stars instead of two is that I've ordered takeout many times and always been happy. It just so happens that I made the mistake of actually eating there the other night.

So we walked in at around 8:30 on a weeknight and the place was about half full. After waiting a surprisingly long time to be approached by a waitress, we were told to just sit anywhere. We picked a table next to two really loud teenagers (our fault) and began perusing the menu.

We decided to start with hot sake and I immediately noticed that one of the glasses had what looked like a small lipstick smudge on it. (The whole place looked dirty and rundown, honestly.)

For my main, I ordered the Crazy Maki (mixed fish, cucumber, avocado, tempura bit and spicy mayo). The first thing I noticed was how large the roll was. It was maybe double the size of a normal roll, which essentially made it impossible to eat. You couldn't really fit the whole thing in your mouth, but if you tried to take a half bite, the whole thing would fall apart. It was a frustratingly sloppy mess. (There's a reason most sushi is bite-sized, it seems.)

I should also mention that there wasn't a pair of chopsticks at the table and the waitress essentially disappeared after bringing the food, so I had to get up and ask a different waitress for a pair.

I'll probably continue to order Hosu for takeout, only because their bibimbap is cheap and tasty. But I'll never order sushi and I'll certainly never eat in again."}
{"text":"Ordered a Chicken Korean lunch box with Tempuras.. The chicken is seasoned with Korean hot sauce, and the taste was just perfect!! Not too salty or dry, the chicken meat was soft and amazing! Tempura was really crispy and doesn't taste oily at all! (although it is deep fried, but...) I liked every bit of what I ordered .. Definitely returning again"}
{"text":"Turns out that my beloved bacon and cheese poke bowl was never discontinued and one of the staff lied to me! When I wrote my initial review, I flat out asked why the image was still outside if it was discontinued and the person insisted that it was. I asked if they had just run out of ingredients and the person again, insisted that no, it was discontinued. Well, I just ordered it a few days ago and was told that it was never discontinued so what gives? I'm tempted to remove one star for this tomfoolery but whatever."}
{"text":"Value is the name of the game at Ho Su Bistro, and luckily it tastes amazing too!

No matter what you order, you will be served some Korean appetizers, which is a nice bonus to snack on. The pricing is extremely reasonable, the menu offers great selection, and you've got the choice of both Korean and Japanese food! Although I would love everything on the menu, I keep coming back to the bento boxes so I can have a bit of everything. It's all delicious, and the service is fast and friendly too.

The atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired. There isn't much in terms of decoration or interesting lighting, which doesn't really matter for what you eat, but I think it's important to the overall experience when you dine out.

From the outside, it looks like a tiny place, but it actually spans quite far back into several large rooms. There is plenty of seating, I've seen a number of large groups come and eat here, so I would disagree with the complaints about it being crammed.

I've tried most of the Japanese places in central Queen West (you have a good number to choose from), and this is my #1 pick in the area."}
{"text":"Got the bibimbap with chicken. Usually would go with beef, but wanted something cooler that day. 

Portions here are very generous in size. Had a sashimi and tempura to share. Sashimi looked really appetizer and was spread on rice. Yumm...

Had to ask the waiter and waitress many times for tea, water, the bill. I did not mind, but I would not come here when you are on in a rush."}
{"text":"Ho-Su has become my go-to place for my weekly sushi fix, particularly when I need it in a hurry. 

THE PLACE: For starters, the staff are friendly and polite, and willing to make accommodations for your meal. i have a deadly shellfish allergy which i always warn them about - so far, I'm alive. The decor is nothing special, but the place is always clean and cheerful. Just watch your step on the way to the washrooms, those are some steep steps. Overall, the place is always bright and bustling, and doesn't have that outdated or musty sense you get in other hole-in-the-wall asian joints. 

THE FOOD: Now onto the food. I have never been disappointed, nor have any of the friends that i've brought here. The sushi and sashimi are always fresh, the rolls are never dried out, and the warm dishes always arrive hot. You can see the assembly line of chefs working away, explaining the freshness of every dish. Even the miso soup, salads, and edemame that arrive before the meals is fresh and not some slapped-together appetizers sitting on the counter waiting to go out. I'm a big fan of their Toronto rolls, $7 for 8 rolls of salmon and avocado with tempura bits inside. The prices of the other rolls are fairly comparable. It's definitely not a pricey place, but it's not dirt cheap either like some other places if you hunt around. However, I believe you get excellent value for your money here. The menu is pretty big and there's a solid variety of rolls, sashimi, appetizers, tempura, boxes, and bowls. Vegetarians and vegans will have no problem finding something to their taste either. My friends and I all swear by the hae do bop and bibim bop, both for taste and large bowl size. The same goes for the bento boxes at lunch, full of varied meals and a solid size. 

I would recommend Ho-Su to any sushi lover or novice, you really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I dined in a few times and had some mediocre, but well-priced food, before dining in on a date which was when a spider came out of my Korean chicken and rice bowl. To avoid freaking out and making too much conversation with the date, I just pushed the food around in the bowl to make it look like I ate it...but really, a spider just came out of that.  
Been back numerous times for some \"meh\" take out sushi against my better judgment because those take out prices agreed with my wallet. Now I have a savings account AND a stomach of steel."}
{"text":"Good quality food. I ordered the Galbi ($12.95 on Grabb app). The meat was tasty and not too chewy. The gave a good amount of slices. The other side dishes are your usual -salad, miso soup, sweet potato noodles and A-choy. For that price and size, I'd definitely come back.

{"text":"I was introduced to Ho Su Bistro back in 2011 and I have been many times with friends. The prices are great and so are the portions but it's nothing special to say the least. The food can be a little bland at times. A few times I ate here I didn't feel like the food was the freshest. I didn't get sick or anything but anywhere I choose to eat I want the food to be fresh obviously. They have a pretty typical menu. The service has always been fast and friendly. I personally won't be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered takeout on JustEat since there was a 20% off deal going on and free delivery. We got the 65 piece sushi platter which has 30 nigiri and 35 maki for $48 and a large order of kam pong gi which is basically fried chicken covered in sweet and sour sauce for $12.95. 

I don't expect much from sushi places on JustEat since a lot of them have pretty bad reviews on Yelp (I check every time before we order to mentally prepare myself). For the price we paid, the amount of food we got and the quality of the food, it was acceptable and I would prob order it again since I didn't get sick and nothing tasted weird. The sushi and maki had a good rice to filling/fish ratio. The chicken didn't have too much powder on it and came with a soup, salad and rice so it wasn't bad for the price. 

The problem we encountered was this. I first called to see what fishes were on the nigiri and forgot to ask about what the makis were so I called back and she put me on hold and never returned so I hung up and called again. After getting no answer at the third call we just decided to place the order and see what happens. We added a note saying no cucumber and to substitute the red snapper for salmon cuz we both don't like it and usually sushi places don't mind doing it. I tried calling again to make sure they saw the note but again no answer. When the food came about an hour later we realized they either didn't see the note or ignored it since there were cucumbers and red snapper. Good thing we're not allergic and just picky."}
{"text":"This was an ok place for Japanese food. Nothing special. If you want a quick fix on your Japanese food craving, this will do. They also serve some Korean dishes. The menu book is falling apart, the place and ambiance is not that inviting."}
{"text":"I had initially recommended my friend try some places in Toronto for dinner, but my friend recommended we try this restaurant instead. She said that the Korean food was very good there, so I decided I would go and give it a try.

I was hopeful that we would be served complimentary banchan, but to my dismay, we did not get any. I was not particularly hungry, so it's not a huge deal, but I usually anticipate getting banchan at Korean restaurants and it was a mild disappointment.

The menu itself was fairly standard, and didn't really have anything particularly standout-ish or unique. After mulling over several different options, I went with the sushi pizza, as fusion dishes seem all the rage these days. It tasted.. fairly standard, exactly what I would expect from battered and deep fried rice with a piece of salmon on top and spicy mayo sauce. It's the type of food I can get just about anywhere, and I was honestly expecting a lot more from downtown Toronto.

There are a ton of really good food options in Toronto, and this is not the type of restaurant that would make a recommendation list given just how good some of the food there is."}
{"text":"Why do I torture myself?

Every time I go here I always get sick (when I eat the sushi). EVERY TIME!  

WHY IS THIS PLACE POPULAR?
I have no idea why all my friends gravitate to this place. Is it b/c it's downtown? probably. Does it have a large selection of korean/japanese food? yes. Is the food pretty? yes. Is the food fresh? NO

FOOD
I always get sick at Ho Su and this time was no different.

When my friends and I first got our appetizers, we picked up an edename bean and holy smokes, it stank like pure rotten food. We were all like \"wtf\".  I knew we should have left at that moment. 

We gave it to the waitress and she was like, no it's fine. She then smelt it and then said she would take it to the front to ask them if it was alright.  She never came back.

So we ordered. I had the spider roll and the giant something role. gah I don't even want to remember.

And then...yes...my stomach started feeling cramping up and I was getting dizzy.  I was not massively sick but sick w/n 1/2hr of eating my meal. 

My dinner date got cut short and I stank up the bathroom. 

Sick rating: 2
1 (just a little sick) to  5 (Emergency, I think i have a parasite) 
I wasn't dying of pain but I did feel really sick."}
{"text":"Ho Su is on my regular circuit when I need a quick, cheap, filling meal, regardless of the time of the day.  

I'm not a big sushi eater and regardless, I wouldn't be too anxious to get sushi here.  However, they have a decent assortment of Korean meals that are quite satisfying.  I normally go for take-out, and as you walk in, there are menu items up on the wall with their pictures and numbers.  The Korean Chicken take-out special, for example, takes about 2 minutes from the time you order and comes to less than $6.  The first time I got it, when they handed me the bag, I remember thinking - \"It's heavy!\"  Inside the styrofoam container was a hot steaming delicious mess of steamed rice, chicken, glass noodles, and a small amount of vegetables.

This is no-frills dining folks, but great value.  Don't forget to grab a plastic fork on the way out if you're eating on the run!"}
{"text":"*THIS REVIEW IS ONLY ABOUT THEIR DELIVERY*

First of all, Ho Su has some fabulous party trays for a great price. They have a large selection on justeat, and the driver arrived sooner than expected. He also had change, if needed. My boyfriend and I ordered a 50 maki roll party tray (super romantic, I can assure you) but Ho Su gave us 12 extra free rolls! The extra rolls are spicy scallop and spicy salmon maki.

The party tray had a lot of selection, and it consisted of california, yam tempura, shrimp tempura and cooked tuna rolls. The maki are rolled neatly and tightly, and they had a pretty big size. Ho Su gives you cute trays for your soy sauce and an abundance of soy sauce packets. As well, they offer up a takeout menu for future reference.

I will definitely order takeout sushi from Ho Su again! I haven't tried any of their Korean dishes but their sushi is pretty cheap with a lot of variety, so maki rolls are the way to go!"}
{"text":"I had no idea how much I enjoyed Korean food until I tried this place. Lots of vegan/vegetarian options. My favourite dish is the Dolsot Vegetable Bibim Bop; tofu, veggies with glass noodles on rice, served in a stone bowl. It's tasty and quite filling.

The most amazing thing about this place, and I'm guessing about Korean restaurants in general, are all the appetizers they bring before your meal! They bring you salad, miso soup, steamed edamame, spicy cabbage, little (soy?) beans in something of a bbq sauce, and a couple other things that I'm not entirely sure of, but they're darn tasty. You're practically full before the meal even gets there! Alright, that's not entirely true but you get what I mean.

All that and conveniently located close to the Scotia bank theater. Grab a meal before your next movie!

- Scotia bank is going to give me some free movie tickets for name dropping them right? Well it's worth a shot."}
{"text":"Used to come here fairly often because of it's convenient location but was never that impressed with the sushi or other Japanese dishes. Really, the only selling point was the prices (big meal for under $10). I found the tempura to be heavy and greasy and the sushi to be meh. 
Recently went back to give them another chance, but this time tried the Korean part of the menu. I had the vegetarian bibimbap that comes in a hot pot. Delicious! Also, nice that they serve the red sauce in a separate dish so that you can control the spicy-ness. Plus, if you order from the Korean dishes, you get all those free side dishes:) 
So, my opinion of Hosu has improved and I would recommend trying some of their Korean dishes (and going somewhere else down the street if you want Japanese)."}
{"text":"We had takeout from here tonight and were very underwhelmed.

We tried miso soup, spring rolls, tempura and 3 types of maki - giant roll, rainbow, and unagi. Overall everything was fine but definitely nothing special. Tempura wasn't panko fried, it was some other sort of breading, which was a little strange. The unagi roll didn't have much unagi, and because of the sweet sauce drizzle on top, the rice was a little soggy and a weird texture. Spring rolls and soup were ok but not amazing. 

I think there are definitely better places for sushi in the neighbourhood, won't be having Hosu again."}
{"text":"One of my go-to places when I feel in the food for some cheap sushi or korean food near me or shopping on Queen St W

The sushi doesn't compare to Japango (my current favourite), but it is half the price and of decent quality. They always have specials on the board so look for those to save even more. Last night I went and got a sashimi bento box for $8.95 - came with 10 pieces of thick sashimi (3 tuna, 4 salmon, & 3 butterfish), rice, salad, miso soup, and carrots & bean sprouts. Enough to fill me up. My boyfriend ordered the largest bento box there, which only set him back $15.95, which had everything mine had, plus tempura (both shrimp and vegetable), california rolls and his choice of chicken, beef, pork or salmon teriyaki. It was so big I had to help him finish it!

The service is fast. I also really like their appetizers - beans, kimchi, some potato thing in kimchi, and my favourite - edaname. It's one of the few restaurants i know that actually give you edaname as a free appetizer.

Overall it's a great place to go if you feel like some sushi or korean food, but don't want to spend too much and want some fast service. Again, the food is not the most high quality, nor the most authentic, but it's a very consistent option that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after wandering around looking for where to grab dinner. I'm sorry to write a bad review but the chicken teriyaki and California rolls in my bento box just tasted plain weird. Didn't even finish my dinner, got it to go, and gave it to a homeless guy (I don't like to waste food)."}
{"text":"If there was an option for a 0 star, I would put it because it was the worst sushi and sashimi I've ever tasted in Toronto. 

I've been to many places around the GTA, and this one has to be the worst. The quality of sashimi was terrible and tasted like it was frozen for days. 

Recommend anyone who wants to go here, DO NOT GO HERE. You will thank me later :)"}
{"text":"This place used to be better. It's not bad, but my last few visits were extremely disappointing.

The dressing on the salad was startlingly tart and acidic, and the kampongi shrimp was sub-standard, with the shrimp being either flavourless or having a bad kind of fishiness to it.

Very disappointed by the tempura onion rings, which were run of the mill frozen onion rings, served with ketchup. 

The sushi is inconsistent and never great, prices have gone up for the take out specials, and the service seems to reflect the general unhappiness of the staff.

Not sure if there has been a change of management, but I cannot recommend in good faith."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for Ho Su as I lived around the corner for almost 8 years. Its a perfect cheap and cheerful lunch or take out spot. Its fast, fresh and consistent. 

My favourites are the vegetable gyoza, the vegetable tempura and vegetable rolls but they also do a very nice bento box for lunch that I think I posted a picture of when I was there last. I used to eat the fish and found it quite fresh here but don't eat is as much anymore. I thoroughly enjoy the vegetarian options here.

When you dine in you automatically get tea (if you want it of course!) and a kimchi plate and some edamame. Nice touch even though I don't fancy the kimchi. It's fast, friendly and fresh - and the take out counter is just as friendly and effecient.

High marks for Ho Su in my old hood :-) Dine-in, take-out or delivery."}
{"text":"Highly affordable Japanese/Korean food, and your taste buds will love you for taking them there.

My favourite things on the menu are the Dolsot Vegetable Bibim Bop, Spicy Tuna Maki and of course Miso Soup. I am also a big fan of their Kimchi mmmm. 

Warning: The place is crammed on the weekends (due to the deliciousness)!"}
{"text":"So living in the yonge and eglinton area , one would only hope there would be a good place to eat sushi. So it's been few years that I have tried this restaurant, I decided hey why not give it a go it's always busy and they seem to have a big selection of food. So I ordered the maki combo, dynamite maki and spicy salmon rolls. Of course this combo comes with edamame,salad and miso soup. The salad was really sweet and not good, the soup was okay, cant screw that one up. Got my really small spicy salmon roll which looked like it was rolled by a newbie, super salty and not enough salmon . The dynamite roll was okay nothing special. I can see why this place is busy, the price is right, if the prices where higher it would not be busy. You get what you pay for, that's for sure."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place more often.  It's a mediocre sushi place that is able to satisfy my cravings.  I like the hwae dop bop which is essentially chirashi (fresh fish) on salad.  I admit this isnt' the best place for sushi, but it does have a good location and nice pricing

atmosphere 3.5/5
food 3
price 4/5"}
{"text":"This is the first sushi restaurant I ever visited. At that time, raw fish was a foreign taste to my palette, as was seaweed, miso soup, and wasabi. The only dish resembling normalcy was tempura- fried vegetables. Ah I think about the olden days with amusement, when tempura used to be my favourite part of the bento box. 

Fast forward a few years and sushi is a mainstay in my diet- I have it at least once a week. Anyhow, I recently visited this restaurant again, and it's quality is still unparalelled. The prices can't be beat. The fish is delicious, the portions are plenty large, and you get a bunch of Korean side dishes with each bento box- a feature no other restaurant offers. 

This is an excellent sushi restaurant, and I plan to continue going here."}
{"text":"Nasty, is one word which describes the vibe in this place.  Miyan hamnidah, folks, but the rudest wait staff I have ever experienced.  You barely get a hello when you arrive or a thank you when you pay.  This place used to be good previously.  There is just an overall nasty vibe about the place.  The food - \"meh, I've experienced better\".  They crank out a lot of \"bentoh boxes\" and nothing which in my estimation appears overly authentic.  First time in my life that I did not tip a waitress due to attitude (hers, not mine).  This is the kind of drop in for lunch for people who work in the neighbourhood kind of thing - i.e. rush through, get fed without savouring."}
{"text":"Had lunch w/ my friend here. They had lots of set lunches, rolls, etc. Lunch Specials were around $7.00 +. The portions were huge (well to me...) and they gave you soup, salad & edamame. Lots of Korean dishes as well. But I was here purely for rolls ^^

I only had the Kamikaze Roll (avocado, tempura, spicy mayo) $5.99? It It was nice & it had 10 pieces. Great deal imho. 

Service was great. Everything came pretty quickly ! 

Take out, delivery, catering available."}
{"text":"What a disaster this place is.  Cramped and noisy to ruin any attempt at ambiance.  Slow and inattentive service.  Mediocre sushi (actually the best part of the experience) and probably good by Toronto standards, but there is better sushi in terms of cut and freshness nearby.  To charge $4.50 for two pieces of that low grade fish is pretty outrageous.  Being worse than other places nearby but more expensive would still get it two stars, here's where they lost the last one...

My friend ordered the beef teriyaki bento and the beef was charred so much it tasted and smelled only of charcoal and couldn't be chewed.  She sent it back for a replacement and they came back with the same inedible thing.  She had been there the week prior and ordered the same dish and she liked it then (that's why she dragged me here), but I guess the chef working today didn't know how to cook teriyaki.  And after she complained the second time a waitress said they'd take $3.00 off for the beef part.  Now her meal was $12, so that's 25% for wasting her time and letting her go hungry because half her meal was inedible.  Now MY meal (softshell crab appetizer (bad) + 8 pc sushi + bottle of cold sake) came to $40, so you'd think they'd be a little kinder and gentler for the hope of repeat business even if they don't know what being sorry for bad food and service is about.  Not here.

So here is the breakdown: inedible to mediocre food, cramped seating, bad ambiance, inattentive service, and highish prices.  AVOID this place.  If you want GOOD sushi or other Japanese foods then take the short walk up Beverly to Baldwin and eat at Etsu."}
{"text":"Cheap with lots of options.

This is where you go when no one can decide.

It's not just Japanese, but it's got vietnamese, korean, chinese all on one menu. 

Food is good and prices are good for what you are getting.

But that sums it up - this place is average. It will not rock your socks off, but you won't be disappointed either."}
{"text":"I was here for a large birthday dinner (20+ pple) and service and food were great! The server put up with our annoying slightly drunken antics. They put us in the back of the restaurant (very wise). The lay out of the place is ideal for hosting a large group.  Good veg and meat options!! Everyone is happy. :) 

Awesome free appetizers include, sald, miso soup, edamame, kimchi, those little soy beans...and some other pickled spicy thing...  

And they don't have candles or cake - but if you want that (for a bday) just tell them ahead of time and they'll do it!

Side Note: This location is WAY better than the Yonge and Eglinton location (I refuse to actually go to the other location). I dont understand how there can be such a difference between the two locations."}
{"text":"Please - Go the Queen Street location or any restaurant in Korean town!!!!

Ugh..on now two separate occasions I have had to send my bibim bop back because it was cold. Seriously, how do you mess bibim bop up. Its just rice with vegetables etc on top and you heat it up in a hot pot. Done! As well the server was confused and  unapologetic about this on both occasions.

They also don't serve you the authentic appetizers...no kimchi...wahhhh!!! Only miso soup and salad. At the queen street location (and other Korean restaurants they do it right)."}
{"text":"I have been here for both take out and eating in, and both times I've left feeling wanting. 

This is not the friendliest place and if you have questions they're not very forthcoming in helpfulness. I found that sometimes they brushed me off. 

The food itself is fine. It's like most cheap sushi joints in Toronto, where the sushi is satisfying enough but it won't blow you away at all. 

People are saying the prices are good, but I haven't found that their sushi sets are particularly well priced. If you go across to Spadina/Queen you'll find much better deals and more selection. 

If you're in a jam or want to grab something quickly, this place will do. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend this place for a date or nice evening out."}
{"text":"Whenever I want cheap, quick sushi this is always the best option. It's not great, but it's not horrible - and I've definitely gone back two or three times. It's in a great location and the staff is always friendly, plus the price makes it worthwhile. No huge complaints except for it's not top quality but I found the sashimi is always fresh!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of sushi.  Like, a lot.  I might actually be singularly responsible for depleting fish stocks off the Grand Banks - that's how much sushi I eat.

So I think I'm quite qualified to tell you that Ho Su at Yonge & Eglinton is a lovely place to go for a bite of the raw stuff.

First off, you'll get quick, efficient service with a smile.  Nothing fancy, perhaps, but it's effortless and unintrusive.  Thumbs up.

Secondly, you'll get nice fresh cold fish.  A lot of sushi places have fish that's warm for some reason; it's like a fat man in a tutu - completely counterintuitive and unpleasant to consider.  Ho Su presents your fish nice and cold and tutu-free.

Thirdly, it's all put together well AND delivered quickly to the table.  If you eat enough sushi, you'll find that some places just slap the maki together so that it's on the verge of falling apart the second you pick it up off the plate.  The overall effect is disappointing, especially because this is intended to be gastronomical art.  Ho Su's chefs are well-trained and they obviously care about the food they deliver to patrons - I've NEVER had badly put-together sushi there and I'd say it takes, on average, 10 minutes from order to serving.  Big thumbs up.

The prices are average for sushi - a MASSIVE dinner for 2 (like, stuffed to the gills...ha HA!) can be had for around $35 with non-alcoholic drinks.  Of course, sushi is best eaten with a nice Sapporo, so I encourage you to splurge a little whenever possible.

And I've made myself thoroughly crave sushi.  Gonna go get some now."}
{"text":"My favourite Asian takeout. This place is my guilty pleasure. The Korean kalbi is delicious. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in town.  It is very affordable, the food taste great and it usually comes pretty fast.  I always have the miso soup.  Their yams tempura are delicious, and they have so many different maki, sishi, and sashimi.  I love their dynamite maki, and their red dragon maki is so good as well."}
{"text":"Where do you go when two of you are dining out and one of you wants Korean, while the other's feeling for Japanese? Ho Su, where a trio of Korean appetizers (edamame, kimchee, and spicy beans) are served on the house while you flip through the colourful menu featuring tantalizing photos, is sure to satisfy. 

From the sidewalk, you'll notice the chalkboard advertising a number of daily specials that are incredible steals of a deal (under $10) range from hot rice dishes to sushi sets.

The list of appetizers to choose from is lengthy. My favourite is the kaki fry ($4.95), lightly breaded, deep fried oysters. The chap chae ($2.95) on the other hand, is nothing but a disappointing little pile of vegetable-less glass noodles. For those who like a like side of kick with your raw, try the Korean hwae dop bop ($9.95), diced assorted sashimi atop salad leaves served with spicy sauce and a side of rice. 

The tiny front patio right on Queen is a great place to people watch, but beware of crazies who are not afraid to come right up to your face to tell you something you'll spend the rest of your dinner trying to decipher. That's happened twice to me, but out of many, many visits, so it's like winning the lottery. Not everyone is so lucky."}
{"text":"I had to give it 1 star :(.

So I went back to this place after 10 yrs as I was in the neighbourhood. This place was packed in its hey day. I ordered the Red Dragon Roll, 4 pieces of tobiko sushi & a small hot sake. I enjoyed the food as I was hungry. They also gave me a small appetizer if korean kimchi & accompaniments. Now 2 hrs later I have a bad stomach ache. I only had 2 macarons 1 hr after dinner so it couldn't be the macarons. I won't be going back. The fish seemed fresh so I am not sure if it was thw fish."}
{"text":"I really like Ho Su Bistro. I can only afford the higher class Japanese restaurants a few times a year but I really love Japanese food, so Ho Su for me is great for those times I really need an injection of Japanese cuisine. 

The service here has always been very nice and accommodating. The place is clean and the atmosphere inside is warm but I wouldn't go too far and call this place intimate. The price and location make this place great for dates and tourist. 

The last time I went to Ho Su, I ordered their chicken teriyaki, which was on special that night. I really like that with every order comes a few small dishes of edamame, kimchi and other treats.  The meal came in a bento box and had a few California rolls and tempura pieces to go with the chicken. The California rolls tasted okay but the tempura was simply delicious. Two large shrimps with a couple of yams covered in one of the lightest tempura batters I ever had. The chicken teriyaki itself was nice even though it was a little over cooked. I found it funny how I ended up enjoying one of the side dishes more than the main attraction itself. I also ordered an ice cold Sapporo beer with my meal. The best thing though was that I was full and it cost me about 20 dollars including tip and tax. 

One time I went here I was dared by a friend to order a beer. Being only 16 that time and still looking like I was in elementary school, I was surprised that I actually got one. Maybe to the workers there I looked 19 but I was amazed I didn't get carded. With that story told, I recommend this place for all underage alcoholics. 

There isn't a lot to hate about Ho Su bistro when you get good food for even better prices. If you want high end Japanese, this place is not for you but if you just want to chow down to kill those Japanese cravings, I would totally recommend you to Ho Su."}
{"text":"I first started going to this sushi bar many years ago. Their menu hasn't changed much (if at all). The prices are amazingly cheap considering their busy location. I like the fact that they serve both Korean and Japanese dishes, though the Korean dishes are not as comprehensive. But regardless if you order Sushi or Bulgogi, you will still get the Korean side dishes as appetizers. 

From my experience, their sushi and sashimi quality is very decent and well priced. But if you're a fan of teriyaki bento boxes, you might be disappointed. The chicken can be dry, and the tempuras a bit stale. Basically their hot foods are a hit and miss; Get something from their sushi bar instead."}
{"text":"Ho Su is a great lunch spot. Their bento boxes are affordable and will give you enough calories to not feel hungry until dinner. What I like especially about Ho Su is their wide range of Chinese, Korean and Japanese dishes on the menu. Their sushi is ok, nothing write home about, but then again, I would go to a Japanese restaurant if I were craving sushi/maki."}
{"text":"Decent spot to grab some sushi. We didn't try the Korean food. 

Sashimi quality was good - obviously fresh. We tried three rolls and they were also decent.

Service was okay and the prices are average. They did charge us extra for tea ($1 each) which is kind of ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Platinum Sashimi didn't have much variety.  The sushi tasted fishy and stringy.  Chicken bi-bim bop was slightly better, but the chicken tasted rubbery.  The ambiance wasn't on par with this hip strip of Queen Street.  I'm sorry to say, but this place has seen better days."}
{"text":"The price is pretty good considering its quantity. Although it is not the BEST Korean food you'd ever have, it's pretty up to standard and you can't go wrong with the price. I went all out the other night, sitting in their patio with warm summer winds, and ordered spicy salmon roll ($5), Chap Chae ($5), and Galbi with rice ($10). The spicy salmon roll was a little fishy and probably was the least good out of the bunch. The glass noodles were good, and the short ribs were fantastic. 

Service is great. Love their patio. Worth coming."}
{"text":"Serviceable, inexpensive and good at churning out the customers.
Seating is cramped but they've got lots of bento-box or -buri options.
Getting take out from here is good.

I miss that Pages bookstore that used to be next door.  God, that totally makes me feel like an old person."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

I've frequented this location many times, mostly for takeouts when I used to live in the area. It's no secret that they have an amazing menu for hungry budget-conscious carb-lovers. 
Their menu is split between Japanese and Korean influences. Straight forward, prices are reasonable for what you get $10-$15 per item. 
On this visit, we order a chirashi don (11.95ish) and a green dragon roll on their chef's special menu (9.95).
Complimentary edamame for starters, which was nice. Chirashi came on a plate with decent amount of butterfish, salmon, red tuna, octopus, and imitation crab stick. Sashimi taste quite fresh. No complaints there. 
Green dragon was huge, I didn't count but maybe 8-10 slices. This kept me pretty satisfied. 
Overall, great if you are looking for a simple, no-fuss dinner. Service was exceptionally efficient and friendly this time around."}
{"text":"Always packed but they always seem to find seats for you. you dont wait too often in line. The tempura last time was very undercooked. The sashimi not so fresh. it's a hit and miss sometimes the food is great but there isn't any consistency. I gave a two star because of that."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say... I am not really a fan of this place.
I ordered the Red Dragon it sounded amazing: dynamite roll wrapped with fresh salmon. Sadly it was disappointing. The shrimp tempura wasn't fresh at all, it tasted stale. 

The Lychee martini was good but tasted very watered down (I guess that's what you get for ordering Martinis at a sushi joints)."}
{"text":"I ordered a katsu chicken to go today and was pleasantly surprised at how crunchy the katsu chicken was even though it sat in a takeout container box! For $10, there was a large portion of crispy, not oily, katsu (breaded, deep-fried) chicken - the breading was light and did not overpower the chicken; there was one sad piece of broccoli, served with rice and hot miso soup. The miso soup was put in its own brown paper bag to prevent any spills to the other containers. The soup wasn't too salty or watery and it did taste like authentic Japanese miso soup (though it was missing a few tofu pieces). Hosu also has some great lunch specials too. So if you get tired of shopping on Queen St. and want to have some quality and inexpensive Japanese/Korean food, you'll have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Eh. I've had so many experiences at Ho Su and all of them have been so different that I don't know what to think. One time I had huge, gross, chunks of tuna in a sashimi combo that made me want to run out the door. Another time I had a chirashi bowl that tasted like heaven. One time my spicy salmon rolls had so much rice in them that I had to peel a layer off. The next, my california rolls were close to perfection.

Basically, because of its location, Ho Su is a huge tourist restaurant, so it's usually overcrowded. Out of the three or four sushi joints in the strip between John St. and Spadina, I'd say Ho Su is my favourite, atmosphere and menu-wise. But as I've illustrated, sometimes it isn't worth the wait.

They do offer you a bunch of yummy little extras -- like bowls of kimchi and soy beans, and free edamame. And you get lollipops at the end. So if you're in an experimental mood, try Ho Su. It can be good, but there is definitely better."}
{"text":"Food is alright but they forgot to give me fork or chopsticks when I ordered takeout. 

I ate with my hands."}
{"text":"I waited an HOUR and a HALF for my delivery order to arrive (sushi and tempura for 2). I ended up calling to cancel. It takes me 15 minutes to walk here from my condo, I do not live very far. 

Not impressed, Ho Su. Not impressed"}
{"text":"This review is only for the udon noodle soup. Clearly not a place for udon. My fault but the vegetable udon was tasteless and something you would expect to eat at a seniors home or hospital. 

The cook needs to take lessons on how to make udon soup. The broth was horrible and tasteless. The vegetables were undercooked.

The only thing the meal did was filling my stomach.  

Here's my recipe for the udon.

Boil water. Put in some salt. Mix in store bought noodles and a few pieces of  vegetables. The end result a bland tasting udon.

I rather eat packaged instant ramen. 

This review was only for the udon. My son liked his teriyaki box."}
{"text":"Very decently sized portions for affordable prices. The rolls were big and the bentos, huge. 

Though, there was something very curious with the shrimp tempura. 

It was almost as if the body of the shrimp was replaced with fish paste that was rolled out and had a tail stuck on. At least, that's what I got from the texture. Weird.

Strange tempura aside, I like this place and I'd be back."}
{"text":"I had 2 coupons for this restaurant from the Entertainment book, and it specifically states in the book that you can use up to 3 coupons per table.  Hosu would only accept 1.  I protested, but the waitress curtly told me she will not take more than one.  I asked her to check with her manager and she claimed she was the manager.  Not one to upset anyone who handles my food, I did not argue further and called the Entertainment book company when I got home.  They apologized to me and told me that this restaurant did not play by the rules.  I was issued coupons for my favorite restaurant, Michael's Back Door.  A high end restaurant that doesn't treat it's coupon customers like second class citizens.

By the way, Hosu's food was not bad.  Not exceptional either.  Besides the coupon incident, the service was subpar at best."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from HoSu Bistro one night for dinner and decided to get the bento box with the Korean chicken (add 1.00$), rice, japchae, seaweed salad, shrimp and vegetable tempura, and 8 piece California roll. The total came out to 19.00 which seemed pricey to me for a bento box but with the variety, it was made for a very satisfying dinner. 

The tempura seemed very hard but since we had takeout, it would have been better if it was eaten fresh. The same went for the chicken katsu (18$) that was also ordered. The tofu stew (18$) was spicy enough to give it a rich flavour but not too spicy for my liking. 

Overall, I would definitely order again from them. I was really satisfied with my meal and it was prepared within a reasonable time. I'll probably try lunch next time due to the price of dinner take out or even stop by the restaurant."}
{"text":"When I worked at Queen & John Ho Su used to be our Asian food eatery of choice and it trumps any of the Queen Market food court counters, East or those other signless spots along Queen. The food is decent but nothing remarkable. I usually order six mixed maki - avocado and sweet potato and it's more than enough food, and under $5!"}
{"text":"Fast, efficient sushi that is fresh and fairly priced.  It feels like a cafeteria both in the haste of the service and the surroundings.  That said, for a business lunch - this works very well.  If you have time and are looking for some atmosphere and somewhere to linger a bit, look further down the street."}
{"text":"Food: 2/5
Service: 4/5
Price: 15 per person

A Chinese place which serves cheap and average Japanese food.

I came to this place because it gave discount for the conference I attended.
I got 15% off, so I ordered teriyaki chicken and tempura bento box lunch special, which costed me $12 total. Lunch came with miso soup and lettuce salad, which was a good deal.
The moment I walked in, I heard chef speaking Mandarin, so I knew it is a Chinese place, not an authentic Japanese place, but it does not matter much.
The chicken I got burnt on the side, so it tasted try and bitter. I don't know why, but they put a layer of raw bean sprouts on the bottom of chicken, which in my opinion, ruined the dish. In the bento box, there was already a small cold dish of bean sprouts salad. I guess they put raw bean sprouts to fill the space, however, raw bean sprouts tasted bitter and did not go well with teriyaki sauce. Lettuce or cooked bean sprouts would be better.
Food quality was just a OK, but the waitress was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, had a bulgogi + rice and a sampling of tempura from my friend's dish.  Price wise, this was expensive for the quality of food I got compared to Korean Grill which was a less than a block east of here.

The only reason this place got the other star was the tempura I tasted wasn't half bad.  However, the rest of the meal was blah.  Not going here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been to Hosu meany times.  It's one of my favorite places to go to for sushi weather I'm getting take out, or sitting and dinning in.  I'm big on sashimi and they always have the freshest Ikura.  Some places mix Ikura with the smaller Tobiko and I don't like it I like the full on Ikura salmon roe and they are super fresh.

The service has always been speedy, friendly.  I have never had a problem at this restaurant and the price is just right for me.

It is definitely a place I would recommend and go back to over and over."}
{"text":"I had the chicken teriyaki bento lunch special. It had the usual setup (chicken, bean sprouts, rice, miso, broccoli) with a side of Korean japchae (forgive my misspelling!). Service was friendly and food was arrived within a few minutes. There's also a slight quiet and eerie ambiance since the tables hidden deep within the long alley from the main entrance. If you're looking for reasonable Japanese food in a somewhat private space, then Hosu would be ideal. Otherwise, you may want to explore Sushi Time or Aji Sai nearby."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful, Ho Su has reasonably priced (though not cheap) lunch specials. While these aren't the delicious $7 meals you'll get in Vancouver, it's the closest you'll get on Queen. Lunch specials come with miso soup, the standard Japanese salad, and some Korean glass noodles. The 'complimentary' kimchi/Korean openers are a nice touch in principle, but are pitifully sized and of only middling quality."}
{"text":"The food is OK, nothing spectacular. The tempura was nice but the chicken teriyaki was a bit bland. The free appetizers are a very nice touch though. Then the rolls came and were pretty disappointing. Good location, clean place, nice service make this a decent place to have a meal."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It was my favourite Asian food spot when I lived locally to it and would make the effort to go back. The tempura is the best from here and I really enjoy the katsu. 
We have eaten in the restaurant and used the takeout/delivery service and both are good. Even with the delivery service it comes with complimentary soup."}
{"text":"Usually come here for take out. For me it's cheap, fast, and good. The tempura take out is below average because it is tempura take out lol. But the overall value for the food is great for the area. You can get take out lunch here for the same as a subway foot long."}
