{"text":"My favorite little breakfast place with Midwest style down home cooking and great prices! My husband and I visit at least once per week. Service is quick, atmosphere is welcoming and the owners are wonderful!"}
{"text":"This place is a great neighborhood bar the owners are awesome and the Breakfast is home cooked and delicious. The Bloody Mary's are huge and the are made from the owners own recipe oh and they are spicy and Delicious also . We are coming back here from now on. 5 stars all day! Try it!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good cheap (on the menu)the waitress is the owner and she will trip you off add charge you way too Much for stuff and then go crazy on you off if you mention it or tell her that your food is wrong. She is very rude and sassy. .. NEVER GOING BACK which is sad because it is a cute little dive"}
{"text":"Have been going to this dive for over 20 years, it is a bit dated, But the owner is awesome. And the food is great and priced right. Ask for the monster breakfast. It will stay with you all day. Hope to going for the next twenty years."}
{"text":"Shame on me.  My wife and I have been putting up with the breakfast Nazi for years.  Today rather than eating at that arches we came to patronize Mrs rude.  My wife needs sugar in the AM, this fine establishment does not serve sweet tea.  So the Nazi makes her own rude remark, she has no reasoning skills.  She also came up with her restaurant remarks.  Since we came to this dump, she counted on us as a party who will accept her abuse.  Sadly, she owns the business and we still tipped her well.  Her husband and grandson are sadly beaten by her meanness to them.  So today I offered to even pay for the tea, she refused I

 guess it would ruin her fadder.  So the only things is to infrequent the Nazi, as she treats customers as she,s doing them a favor.  Good luck poor husband and grandson."}
{"text":"Great country food.  Very good Bloody Mary.  I always Oder the monster"}
{"text":"Was looking for a Bloody Mary, nothing was open until 11. Decided to check this place out. So glad I did. Everything here is perfect, very dive but very comfortable. Our waitress is amazing, and her Bloody Mary she prepared is incredible. Breakfast is very good. Love the environment, if you're into fancy stuff this isn't the place for you, if you're looking for a good meal served by great people come here."}
{"text":"Breakfast was ok. It wasn't great, wasn't good , but was ok. There is a \"sports bar \" located in the back , even has a separate entrance, but they serve the same food. Nothing wow about this place ."}
{"text":"We checked out this place on a Sunday after driving by it since forever. I'm glad we stopped! Great, American style food for very reasonable prices. Service was quick, waitress was nice and easy to talk to. We felt right at home at this place and will continue to visit."}
{"text":"This place is your classic hole in the wall outdated dive that you'd expect to see on the side of a country road.  Food is not to shabby and CHEAP! I've only been for breakfast (several times). I get the steak n eggs w/hash browns and it's a steal at $6.95! Biscuits and gravy are pretty decent as well.  As far as the waitress (owner), yeah her customer service skills and attitude could use work for sure but she can grow on ya.  I don't go expecting 4 star service but for good and CHEAP food!!  I do think the mimosas and bloody mary's are a bit over priced ($7.50) but other than that, you'll leave there full, satisfied and not broke!"}
{"text":"I Love this place...its comfort food with a crazy price and service that would keep you coming back. The bar does a hugh amazing bloody mary (Best in town) and the kitchen keeps it simple but perfect."}
{"text":"Only 2 stars for this joint.  Rude owner with smart ass comments and don't dare challenge her because she will win.  Kinda dumpy, needs some updating or cleaning or something!  I don't go to an eatery to be verbally abused by a waitress even if she is the owner and she is trying to be funny.  Is it that hard to be nice?  Food was just ok, nothing special. Ok for a small place which wasn't at all busy.  I think the bar is where all the business is.  I don't drink so I can't comment on that side.  I won't go back.  I can check this dump off my bucket list."}
{"text":"I had the Taco Salad for lunch.  It was spicy which made up for any shortcuts from a short order kitchen.  Very friendly folks.  I bet they are a perfect place for breakfast a simple country breakfast.  Prices are really cheap!  Cheaper than fast food!"}
{"text":"went to try this place based on one review on yelp  the waitress was rough around the edges in her waitress/hostess roll the place smelled like one of those old town restaurants that people probley smoked in for years combined with greese that may not get changed as much as it should. as the waitress cleared tables there was alot of crashing of dishes in the dirty dish bin. I must say i sliped out before ordering food may be good if lucky ........"}
{"text":"This location has 2 businesses. A bar and a grill. I never entered the bar. I only eat at the grill for breakfast. I love the food though. This is a great, greasy spoon when you don't care about exotic \"gourmet\" concoctions an upscale location or an eye catching electronic sign. This place serves your standard menu items. Quality food,  reasonable prices and low overhead. Just the way I like it! The other reviewers commented on the owner and her abrasive nature. I agree she is abrasive but only at first glance. She is funny and sweet if you give her a chance."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came over at 10am. We got a wonderful greeting, and water right away. 

The waitress is very friendly and took our order. I got a grilled cheese with fries, hubby got a breakfast burrito with eggs, sausage, cheese...with a side of salsa.

Both meals came out fast!

Hubby on the burrito: When you commit to do something as simple as comfort food, it has to be on point. They have achieved that. 

Me on the grilled cheese and fires: simple, buttered sourdough is excellent, cheese gooey and delish. One of the best grilled cheese Sammies ever!

We would come back again. I wish we lived near here! (We live 3 hours away)"}
{"text":"This place is somewhat hidden, but is totally worth your time. If you're into home style food, home style drinks, and home style folks... this is your place! Great service and nice folks!!!"}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary ever! The owner is so cool, she's just a real person and made me and my friends feel so comfortable, went to this place twice on vacation in mesa Arizona , it's a bomb breakfast place and the owner makes her own Bloody Mary mix... thank you so much for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast dive in town. You're going to wait, but enjoy a Bloody Mary while you do. Homemade Bloody Mary mix. It's mostly regulars but we've been going here almost every weekend for years and Steve and Cindy are the best! Hands down, my favorite breakfast joint. Ask for the machaca, it's not on the menu. Super cheap and very delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast.  Great service.  Friendly people.  Felt right at home.  We enjoy the owner and her sense of humor."}
{"text":"Breakfast was not bad. They keep a sign outside that says Today's Specials that the owner/waitress is too lazy to update. It stays outside and is blank. SMH. ( Not a great first impression) 

Pros:  Close to home and convenient and prices are not outrageous. Sausage gravy was excellent. Ham steak was pretty good. The bloody mary looked tasty that she brought out for another customer.

Cons: Waitress is the Owner and she makes a habit of telling you she is the owner. ( Cocky old broad ) --- I should've taken a picture because your first impression is \" Where should I sit\"? Almost all the seats need MAJOR upholstery work and have packing tape it appears holding them together. It needs a thorough cleaning and updating. It definitely is NOT a place you would EVER take a date to.  If you like a local dive, this is your place. Breakfast isn't bad but bacon is way overcooked. 

Some guy named Richard ( she called him by name as I assume he is a regular) came in with his ( Compassion?) dog. It was a larger dog that barked and growled at the owner. About a few minutes later another person came in with their dog.  I'm not against outdoor dining areas that allow dogs but this just made it seem dirtier than it already is. 

I guess I would come here with the boys but if you asked me to recommend I would have to say .......pass this one by. 

Wal-Mart kinda place.....not Target quality. ( If you know what I mean)"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to eat lunch, didnt want fast food...but.. yeah McDonald's would have probably tasted better. Walked in and noticed the outdated decor...and the smell. Decided to give it a try anyways. Ordered the chili burger. As soon as they delivered I was like ugh. I took one bite and it was the worst chili i had ever had! Never going back..."}
{"text":"Service is great. Food is delicious.
I love that bloody Mary, it's perfect for me.
Why go anywhere else and over pay for breakfast when you can go here and get a good breakfast at a really good price !

When you are done go to the front to pay."}
{"text":"Simple home style food. The owner is awesome with a great sense of humor. If your looking for a clean establishment where you can enjoy a tasty well prepared meal for a really reasonable price, this is it!!"}
{"text":"It was a Saturday morning, I hadn't slept in days. Upon a hazy recommendation from the Hollywood Alley (RIP), I trudged my way through the streets of Gilbert to Mesquite Grill. Thank God for this establishment.

Why?
a) bloody mary (super huge glass) available for breakfast
b) delicious Mexican omelette (chorizo, cheese, salsa, etc) with a side of guac
c) plenty of seating, nice and cool
d) great waitstaff-- \"old fashioned\" (lady orders first), but a bit surly and fun

I ate my way from misery to happiness at Mesquite. And I couldn't even FINISH my bloody mary. It was that big. 

Love ya, Mesquite. Be back as soon as I'm in Mesa...er... Gilbert... errrr... within 25 miles."}
{"text":"Been going to the Mesquite  on and off  for years it's right around the corner from my work great food great people never really had a bad time or meal there great place. Good food good prices A little hard to find but worth a look you can't forget the bar next-door either nice little place"}
{"text":"We come here often for breakfast.  It's 5 minutes away from where I live so it's nice and convenient.  I can come have a yummy inexpensive breakfast with a delicious Bloody Mary! 

Most of the time we sit in the restaurant area because I often bring my kids- but like the bar area as well.  There's only one bartender there and she gets busy on a Saturday and Sunday morning, so prepare for a little wait."}
{"text":"Definitely NOT a sports bar. Horrible and few TVs. A local dive bar? Yes. But don't call yourself a sports bar if all you have is 1980's vintage TVs."}
{"text":"Most definitely a hole-in-the-wall neighborhood bar. Decor is very much dated, but the bartender, Debbie, is super nice and tends to her customers' every need. Food is ok, but not the best. Owner is rough around the edges, but extremely funny and carries a take shyte from no one attitude, but in a good way. Not my favorite place, but ok if you like dive bars."}
{"text":"This is great food, great prices, and an interesting owner/server who has a great sense of humor.  It may not be the best decorated place in town , but I do not eat the decorations . This establishment has a great record with the food safety board, that,s what counts."}
{"text":"The best old fashion friendly hometown service. Awesome food and fantastic prices. Love hearing the sound of a real cash register too! Very charming and some of the best salsa!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"It's sunday and I'm killin time before my sons basketball game, had intentions of goin to wildernest bar, but this was closer. This place not at from Inspire courts. They do serve breakfast all day which, in my opinion is awesome. I didn't order food but checked out the menu. Prices seem fare. 
Typical dive bar. Friendly service (1bartender), dark, musky smell, 1 pool table, all TV's tunes into nascar. It did the job for me. One beer and in and out i time for my boys game. Thank you for being convenient and quick. Next time I'm in the area Need a beer to kill time before a game I'll come here."}
{"text":"The Mesquite Grill is located in an unassuming business park just west of the railroad tracks that run south from Mesa.    In my experience, dining establishments like these are usually delis catering to the 9-5 crowd, and typically only open weekdays for breakfast and lunch.

What caught my eye about the Mesquite Grill was the fact that it was open on a Saturday, and there were several cars parked out front, which meant customers!  I decided this warranted further investigation.

Stepping into the place, it was immediately apparent that this is a working class, down-home, regulars type of place.  A little country, a little worn and dated, but in a comfortable way that made me feel at home.

After being greeted warmly by the waitress (who I later found out was also the owner), I was handed a menu and seated myself.  Breakfast is served all day, but I was there for lunch, so  after scanning the lunch menu options I settled on the \"Newport\".  The Newport is a grilled turkey and swiss with diced mushrooms, onions and green peppers on a hoagie roll.

Choices of sides include fries, patato salad, and cole slaw.  Both the potato salad and cole slaw are made fresh onsite, so I opted for the slaw. The prices are very affordable -- most lunch entries were between $5-7.

The sandwich was pretty tasty, and the cole slaw delivered. Portion size was just right for someone hungry for lunch.  This place is the essence of the locally owned hole-in-the-wall, and the staff really makes you feel welcome.  The vibe reminds me of the Chicken Pie Shop in San Diego.  I'll definitely be back to try breakfast."}
{"text":"People can say all the bad things they want about this place ! But trust me.  They are wrong. The food is great , it's cheap, the owner remembers your name and what you order each time, it's not dirty ( just out-dated) but that's what makes it unique!!! Never leave hungry here! And they're mimosas are delicious! The owner is not cocky or rude ( like someone had said before)  try this place out! Been going here every Sunday for several years!!!"}
{"text":"This may be indeed the best hole in the wall restaurant in the east valley. This place is a sleeper but indeed a diamond in the rough. The waitress is a hoot, she calls it as she sees it and often starts singing randomly based on what is playing on the radio. The daily specials are always a hit and the food is always fresh. Any regular yuppie would walk in and walk right out and that is another feature I love. Most of the patrons work near the area and seem to visit daily based on their report with the waitress. And yes they all are working class people that refuses to eat crap via a chain restaurant/drive thru. My wife had the daily special open face pork tenderloin sandwich w/mashed potatoes and gravy while I had the cheese crisp with machaca, homemade salsa and sour cream. I could eat here daily and caught myself laughing out loud many times because of the waitresses quick wit."}
