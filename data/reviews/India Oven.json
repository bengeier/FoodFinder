{"text":"This place made me sick.

No, no, not like that! 

I just had the buffet and ate too much.  Now it's my fault for being a glutton, I admit, but the food was just too good.

The servers were very attentive and were quick to offer drink refills and replenish our supply of their amazing naan.

The food here is so good I'm almost afraid to go back and risk another food induced coma."}
{"text":"coming from LA, me and my coworker were craving for some tandoori chicken and naan. Yelp and found this place. I have tried plenty of Indian cuisine and I would say this taste pretty bland. But again, its in Az and the lunch buffet have fair choices of vege and non vege food. Plus point, they bring out fresh naan. Yum :)"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet: of all vegetarian dishes, all but saag paneer were tasteless. Naan was very good though, fresh and plentiful."}
{"text":"I love their samosa chaat, every time I'm in Vegas I just go here for samosa chaat. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Oh what the heck.. 5 stars!  :)
We came here based on the reviews.  We have never tried Indian food and we were pleased. Short wait when we arrived. Looked like a popular place. We had checked out the menu online before going to try to figure out what to order. When we got seated we were invited to serve ourselves at the buffet. ..so, when in Rome, as they say, or India in this case, we went up to the popular buffet. 

I have little idea what we ate but it was all delicious and quite complex in flavor compared to our usual fare.  We were a bit conservative on our first trip.  As everything tasted so good, the second trip was a bit more daring. I cleaned my plate each time. Yummy! Glad we went for it! Friendly Staff as well."}
{"text":"We love this place. 

We love Indian food and have been to several around the valley.   But this place is the best. Amazing flavors. Great service. And our kids love it."}
{"text":"I've only eaten Indian food a few times but my husband has been over to India for business a couple of times and was feeling a bit nostalgic.  We decided to try this place after I found it here on yelp with such good reviews.  

He liked it for the flavors & went back twice more after he said \"I'm full, I need to stop.\"  I liked it for the flavors as well but I also liked the fact that I could sample different dishes without having to order a big plate of something that I don't like (as can sometimes happen when you're unfamiliar with the cuisine).  

ALL of the staff was friendly and attentive and I swear that each of them stopped by our table at one point or another to check on us.  They had a real team feeling about them.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"We have come here for several years and love it!   Love the buffet served after 5 and the staff are nice and very attentive."}
{"text":"Worst food ever in my life. Asked for 3 vegetables and all had the same shitty gravy and when we said that all have same gravy the manager is fucking proud to say ya we have same gravy in all vegetable. 
Seriously the restaurant should learn and should not defame the name of Indian food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great price! Highly recommend India Oven!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant ever! Anyone who does not agree is just plain crazy. The food is delish, the service attentive, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was great. The flavors seemed authentic. The food seemed to be made from good quality ingredients. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp! and had dinner there last night. All three of us love Indian food and don't get to enjoy it very often. This place is great; we loved it. A magnificent buffet at a reasonable price. And even with a buffet, we still got attentive service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Best Indian Buffet! Really well done. The service is always great and the food is spot on! I always come here when visiting AZ!"}
{"text":"Best indian food I've ever had. Unlike other indian restaurants with only a few entrees to choose from, this place had a great array of curries. And unlike other restaurants with dried out tandoori chicken and naan bread on the buffet line, this place brought hot baskets of (perfect) tandoori and naan to our table! The highlights for me were the fish curry, mint chicken, tamarind chutney, and mango lassi. Servers were really attentive and nice-- I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! The tikka masala is the best I've  had in the Phoenix area. Order that with the onion kulcha and you will become addicted like me."}
{"text":"We just came back from our first time at India Oven but not the first time we have had Indian food.  

We both got the buffet, which came with delicious Naan and Tandoori chicken -- brought straight to our table from the kitchen.  Everything lived up to the other glowing reviews for this place on Yelp.  

Some small disappointments were that the Naan was garlic -- we would have preferred plain to try for our first time out.  Also, the mango lassi was a little warmer than I would have liked - but still was tasty!  And like the other yelpers have mentioned, the spice level was low on the buffet.  

Some of the things we really appreciated:  the place was clean, service was very attentive, the chicken tikka masala was very flavorful and we couldn't imagine it being better anywhere else!

Overall, we really enjoyed our experience and will be back again!"}
{"text":"It is the best Indian food we have had since we got here 15 years ago.  We went for the lunch buffet on Sunday.  Lots of variety and not cheap dishes, they had two lamb dishes which were excellant. The sauces all had good flavor.  Moderately hot although the lamb vindaloo was hotter. Also excellent tandori chicken and daal. The main dishes were a better bet than the appetizers.  My wife does not tolerate chili heat so she got the chicken tikka masala very very mild and it was great.  Lots of flavor but mild enough for her to eat.  So if you have some one who does not tolerate hot foods this restaurant can accommodate them, a rare thing in Indian restaurants.  We both left stuffed, my wife took home half her dish home although she did have pouri.  the rice pudding at the end was excellent, the raita was also excellent.  The tab for two of us was $27, a real bargain for this quality of food."}
{"text":"Discovered this place by driving by. I was really excited to have Indian food. Being from L.A I tried to not have any expectations or comparison to what I have had in the past. The establishment was very charming. We came here on a Friday with our two toddlers. The staff was very friendly. The food here was amazing. The kids loved the bread (naan) and eat everything in their plates. Everything the had was finger licking good. Great flavor and the lamb is fantastic. This was better than some of the places back in L.A. A true gem and a must try if you are in the area. Luckily for me it's only 10 mins away. I will be a frequent customer for sure. 10 stars in my book"}
{"text":"I am writing this review as I sit with my family in the booth at this restaurant. I am in a food coma because I couldn't stop eating ! Fabulous food, great service and very reasonable prices. The four of us enjoyed every single thing we ate from the buffet . I wish I lived close to this place:-)"}
{"text":"We went in for the buffet. I gave this restaurant three stars because of the good variety the buffet had. Other than that, the food was subpart. It just did not taste as exciting and tasteful Indian food usually is. It seemed like it was watered down for average Joe's taste buds. 

The other thing is the waiters standing right in the center of the restaurant like soldiers in a morning drill. My biggest advice to this restaurant is not to do that and keep it original in terms of flavors."}
{"text":"Great food!!! They have a lunch and a dinner Buffett, both are very inexpensive and the food is soooooooo good! Lots of veggie options!!"}
{"text":"Really good food. The service was excellent as well. Definitely a place to add to your resturaunt rotation."}
{"text":"Great casual dining.  This was our first visit and the wait staff recognized the fact.  They offered help at every juncture.  The buffet was superb.  I tried a bit of everything and found nothing I didn't like.  Definitely on our return list."}
{"text":"had their buffet and i liked just about everything they had but the tandoori chicken & the chicken masala were amazing! great naan bread and very friendly staff"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the valley! Great food and nice staff!

I only wish the dishes were a tiny bit more spicy. But I understand it is buffet so they tone it down."}
{"text":"This place is inexpensive, food is AWESOME and service is solid. Drinks were always full, dirty plates were always picked up quickly. 

Awesome place!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars really, overall ... meh sums it up.The whole thing just lacked flavor, which Indian food is all about, right?  We went to thier brunch buffet the food was ...meh, the deco was ...meh, the service was good the waiter friendly, there were not many people here when we came usually that is a bad sign. Its was only $10 each for all you can eat so we didn't feel it too overpriced like most things in vegas."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious and superb service! The waiters were always attentive and the buffet table has vegetarian and meat-based options all of which are delicious! I have eaten at several Indian restaurants in the area and India Oven is my favorite by far! I am sitting in the restaurant booth right now writing this review."}
{"text":"I returned  after refusing to go back 7 months ago. I wanted to really give them a second chance.  During my previous visit they made me wait 30 minutes for pakoras to be put on the bar and after multiple checks with them and \"it will be 5 minutes\" responses , I was told another 30 minutes. I left. Even prior to that, we would go to the buffet at opening and would have to wait an hour for the pakoras. I really like the pakoras.

Last night done it for me. I drove all the way over from Queen Creek arrived around 8:40. They close at 9:30. I wanted the buffet to go and asked could they refill the pakoras, they were out.  I was told they don't add food after 9pm. It was 8:45! I asked the server could they make some for me to include with my to go box. He went to the kitchen and came back stating the cook said:\" no, no more food after 9pm.\" I showed him the time...it was 8:48 pm. He shrugged. 

I gave him the box back and left. I'm done now. They should go visit Ruchi over and Chandler to see how good customer service should be done.

I gave them a 2 because the food is good...best i could do."}
{"text":"Limited options but I think that's standard for Indian restaurants. Its not expensive, so that's good. I gave it 3 stars because I've never been a fan of Indian food and considered it possible that I could change my ways after seeing the movie 'The Hundred Foot Journey', but alas I haven't changed. I would have given it 2 stars but that would have been rude.

The employees there are very impersonal. They would give you water then run away before you had a chance to say thank you, as if they're anti-social. So don't expect anything from them."}
{"text":"I've been to about 6 or 7 indian buffets across the valley and this is the best one I've been to.  There is no doubt I'll be back here."}
{"text":"Only thing to say is this place is delicious. I love Indian food so much. The vibe was great and they had awesome customer service. I love curry and if you do too this is the spot to check out."}
{"text":"I've been coming to India Oven for their buffet lunch for more than 10 years - since they were on Sahara west of LVB. 

Food & service is always consistent. They have the best naan!  Favorite dishes are their chicken kabobs (spicy), samosas, spinach daal, and this rice-milk dessert they have with cardamom spice and almonds. They cook their tandoori chicken on the bone traditional style- it goes fast at the buffet so get there early!"}
{"text":"Update:      Went there again last night and I loved it!   

Had the buffet again, and tried more things and liked them all.   They serve you some kind of AWESOME chicken on a skillet with your buffet order, and now it seems like they serve you also some ground lamb kabob as well!   It was pretty good.

This time I also tried some of the desserts, and those were freaking awesome too!  The desserts were very light, but very flavorful.  Some type of mango custard, and warm carrot dessert were my favorites.

What a great price! ($10 dinner buffet w/ a coupon from The New Times).  Still have to say that the Palak Paneer is not the best  :(      But it is ok.    Seems like the place has picked up some business, so good for them!   All of the wait-staff was very friendly and attentive.  GREAT service.

-Nik"}
{"text":"I just came here today for lunch with a few friends. I'm a fan! Many times when you go to buffet and the stuff looks old or subpar. This one looked good and inviting. They have a good variety of options with your typicals. I was impressed though cuz there were a few that aren't the usuals, so that was a plus!

I very much liked the mango lassi, the garlic naan that they give you (and make sure that you always have at least 3 on your table). The service was very attentive (sometimes a little too much, but I prefer that over none ;) ) The lamb today wasn't very tender, a bit dry, but I won't write them off cuz of that. To be quite honest, I can't tell the authenticity of the flavors of the dishes since I'm not Indian nor did I have that upbringing. But compared to other Indian restaurants that I've tried (which are plenty), this one is good!

My other fav was their rice pudding and carrot dessert (I'm drawing a blank right now). That was good... 

Looking fwd to bringing the hubs here!"}
{"text":"Only restaurant that offers dinner buffet at very affordable prices. They have separated their vegetarian and non vegetarian sections and plenty of choices. I have taken lot of my colleagues to this buffet so that I can familiarize them with various dishes and next time they are at an Indian restaurant they are not list and can order in their own."}
{"text":"Where are all these great reviews coming from?? I mean seriously have these people never had Indian food before?

No flavor, no spice, and owners that just stare at you the whole dang time."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly and immediately brought a plate of garlic naan. My boyfriend got the buffet and got way more than his $12 worth. Everything he ate looked and smelled fantastic. As other people mentioned, there are 3 sections: vegetarian, non-vegetarian, and desserts.

As someone with a nut allergy who also loves Indian food, it can be a little scary to come to a buffet. Our server was kind enough to talk with me about my options. I ended up with the non-vegetarian combination plate. It was delicious--like my own nut-free buffet tray. It had daal, chicken tikka, some sort of delicious chicken curry, naan, raita and rice pudding. There was so much food in that one tray that I took 2 boxes of leftovers home."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, great service. $9.95 for a delicious Indian buffet just can't be beat. The waiters were awesome and brought water, naan, and tandoori chicken whenever we got anywhere close to needing more. It was so different to what I am used to. I DEFINITELY recommend and will be sure to come back the next time I'm in Mesa!"}
{"text":"I've never been lucky enough to travel to India but the food at India Oven is absolutely fantastic! I've been disappointed by many Indian food restaurants and my last regular place closed down. India Oven consistently has an excellent variety of food that's always tender and flavorful. Plus you can't beat the mango lassi, naan bread, and tandoori chicken that is all included in the modestly priced buffet. Not to mention the service is always outstanding. I've been here a couple of times already and even brought my boyfriend who was weary about trying Indian food but he loves it! It's now a part of our regular restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Thank you Phx for not completely sucking in the Indian food sector. This place was a surprise. I won't compare it to anything in LA, because its hard to beat their cost and taste. But the food was affordable and the flavors were enjoyable. 

When I ate the murg makhani or the beghan bhatra, I wasn't angry! Everything tasted fresh, the dinner buffet looked good, and the owners are very hospitable. Sooooo much better than Guru Palace...I don't understand how anyone can eat there. 

I didn't have the dinner buffet, but since it looked fresh and included lassi and chai, $9 seems like a great value and will definitely indulge in it next time. At the end, they gave us some gulab jamun and it was warn and cooked well...not frozen, thank gawd! 

My only complaint is that the spice level was a little low for us, but considering the lack of decent indian food in the area, it's really not a make or break thing. With everything we ordered, plus leftovers, we got out of there for less than $30."}
{"text":"I had the lunch the offered at the Intel office in Chandler. Super yum tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala with Basmati rice. The samosa sides were kick-ass too! Roti could have been better. None the less, few of the best Indian food I had in months :)"}
{"text":"Buffet was ok
Tasted weird sometimes
Good decor
Good catering service
Delicious chutney"}
{"text":"Great northern Indian cuisine, really outstanding.  We had the buffet, which I'm usually wary of, but here it was exceptional.  The only downside - there were so many dishes to sample I ate way too much and spent the rest of the afternoon in a food-coma on the sofa making whale noises.  Well worth is, I must add."}
{"text":"I had a lunch here with my wife when we were getting out of las vegas. Actually I was planning to go to Origin India and landed here when I did not get the correct directions to it. This place looks okay and the service is also average. Everyone is very busy and does not wait to get an answer. The lunch buffet had egg curry, spring rolls, veg curry, tandoori chicken and other items listed. The spring rolls and tandoori chicken were mostly empty and not refilled. The dal was pathetic and the rice was also not good. The desert pudding was too thin and made me think it was a fruit juice!! Over all this food is a very sub standard indian food and would not recommend it to anyone. The owner should be happy to have a crowd (wait time is almost 30 min) and must make the place much better so that he does not loose the clientle."}
{"text":"My first experience with Indian Food. With the buffet option, we were in and out in 35 minutes! I was able to try several different dishes and was amazed at the outcome. So many choices with contrasting flavors! The desert options were also fun to try. I would recommend this restaurant to any who wants to try something new. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places around. The food is fantastic and the service is top notch. Try it. Amazingly inexpensive too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat at india oven every week! The food is always fresh and they are always attentive to the needs of each table. We love india oven and I haven't eaten at an indian restaurant that meets or exceeds india oven!"}
{"text":"Everything is amazing!! I love their buffet! I've tried several Indian restaurants in the area, and this one is my favorite! The food is always fresh whether you go for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Dinner buffet, Woo Hoo! We love being able to have an Indian buffet at dinner time. Everything was tasty and well prepared. Even the rice was delicious. Excellent naan. 
We do plan on returning."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Buffet has a dish for all..veggie meat lover or anything you can imagine. Menu is also amazing. Servers are attentive without being annoying. Peaceful atmosphere. Quality food at a reasonable price.  Full bar service a plus.."}
{"text":"Excellent food, amazing service. Some of the best Indian food I've ever had. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The restaurant was a little dark and it had a lot of pieces of art like paintings and little statues that were connected to Indian culture. I don't think there was any Indian music, but it could have just been quiet.  About half of the customers in the restaurant were Indian, which made it seem more authentic. 
What made it really authentic though was the food. The waiters gave us some garlic  naan that was simple but tasty. We decided to do the buffet and although the buffet wasn't very big, there were still lots of choices. They had vegetarian foods, chicken in Indian sauces and spices, Indian tea, curries, and even some Indian desserts. After eating at Indian Oven I know that Indian food is not my favorite but it was still a good place to eat and I would go back if in the mood for Indian. I think people who like Indian food will really like it."}
{"text":"Gosh I love this place! An $8.95 buffet full of delicious (and spicy, but not too) unique dishes. Includes the awesome mango yogurt drink and chai tea. Man I wish this were by my house!!!"}
{"text":"They catered an event for about 40 people, excellent authentic food. The awards up on their wall are there for a reason."}
{"text":"Even the mango lassi is part of the buffet! If you're a weak vegetarian, beware the sizzling fresh chicken they deliver to your table along with fresh steaming naan bread. 

Please Indian food gods, send a satellite of this place to Tucson!!!!"}
{"text":"In Arizona for vacation and after reading the reviews came to India Oven for dinner. Amazing dinner buffet with a great selection . Will not disappoint in both service and food.   Oh the prices are also great! Thanks yelp!"}
{"text":"My wife, 4 year old, and i went for the 1st time, and we love it.  We went on a Wednesday night and they were busy.  Food was great and the staff was courteous.  No question that they value their customers.  Good 1st impression.  Hopefully, our subsequent visit will be just as good or better."}
{"text":"I had to write this after reading the review from June 2012 where the reviewer wrote that he thought anyone that gave a positive review to the Indian Oven had never had good Indian food. My wife and I have searched out Indian food on trips pretty much around the globe. Obviously great Indian food in London and NYC but we have found good and sometimes not so good Indian restaurants on many of our trips. The Indian Oven is a great restaurant and we take all of our visiting friends there. We are very happy that we have this great Indian restaurant so close to us in Mesa!"}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical of buffets, the Yelp reviews helped my decision to give it a try. Loved it. And they keep bringing hot garlic naan to the table. 

Wish they would label the foods with a few English words. Though almost everything I tried that was unknown to me was delicious. 

Not wild about Indian desserts, though the rice pudding was a hit."}
{"text":"Met g/f for lunch the other day.  Had the buffet and ordered a side of onion kulcha.  The food was tasty enough but not good enough for a 4 rating from me."}
{"text":"Ok overpriced portion size was ridiculously small will never go there again they charged 15.00 for a tiny portion of food I will recommend that no one goes there !!!!"}
{"text":"Great Buffet at a good price.
Great way to try a bunch of different foods from another culture!
Chicken TikKa Masala, aloo beans, naan bread, daal are all great
BEWARE THEY SERVE GOAT :)"}
{"text":"My husband hates buffets.  I took him to this one and he LOVED it. The food is great quality. Taste fresh. Amazing service. My cup of water was never empty. When I was done to with the food, they took the plate away right away. For lunch as an adult we both paid $9.95 . 

And I LOVE their desserts too. Very fresh and moist."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place after reading such positive reviews but boy was I wrong...this is probably the worst Indian food I had. We eat out every Friday and have been doing so for 3 years since we moved to Arizona. We gave this place a try since they had a buffet but the food was awful, forget about authentic Indian food this place was a fake. Even the desserts were awful. Mango Lassi was okay but besides that even my drink didn't taste like Sprite. It was just bubbly water. I am never going back here!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Vegas found this place and was happy my ordered biryani. After tasting the food I felt it should have been named as nasal rice than biryani. Very much disappointed with taste of the food. My friends ordered vet thali and it also very disappointing taste. Not a single curry was tasty. And not at all worth what we pay for the food I would suggest do not unless you got money to waste. Unfortunately the response of the supervisor was that \"we can't help it\" not even ready to accept the feedback and surprise is that before serving they requested us to give feedback don't know for what ;)"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews too much but Tripadvisor sent me a message if I have a review for any of these places.... the last one mentioned was India oven. OH YES. I want to support them!!! Keep them around by stopping in. They will allow you to purchase the buffet to-go, and you get to fill one large styrofoam box which is plenty to eat. For a person who usually orders take out if I want a restaurant meal in the middle of the week this is PERFECT. SERIOUSLY... YUM!!! Been going here for lunch and dinner for years. REPEAT and REPEAT customer. Cravings for it."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my friend last summer. Been coming back again and again ever since.

The owners and host are so very friendly. They always say hello and come by our table to check on us. Its clean, quiet, intimate and detail-oriented.

The food is fresh, hot and always prepared with love. we always feel welcomed when we come here and always leave happy and full."}
{"text":"Awesome Indian buffet! My husband and I go here all the time and it's always a very pleasant experience. The staff is very nice and attentive too! Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I would classify it as an upscale Indian Restaurant - nice interior, tablecloths, cloth napkins, lot of silverware, etc...

Food was excellent but I think over priced.  Service in general was good but it took a long time for the food to come out even though it wasn't crowded.  Curious because we sent one of the dishes back because it was too spicy and a replacement came back fairly quickly which made us wonder why our original order took so long - like half an hour."}
{"text":"I recently became addicted to this place. Love it! The buffet is awesome. Cheap and delicous. I always leave full and satisfied. Also, the staff is great. They are always on the floor paying attention to your needs."}
{"text":"Always loved their food, I hadn't been for a few years though  so I decided to take my hubbby there for dinner.
Food was good but customer service was terrible. Manager was a complete ***hole and we don't plan on ever going back."}
{"text":"Delicious, hot and fresh.  That's about the extent of my Indian food knowledge.  Curry, Chicken and Lamb, Fresh hot  flat bread. All hot, fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Indian Buffet under 10 bucks : 14 options Veg, Non Veg and deserts.
Food was properly cooked and the Lamb Vindaloo with Rice and Raita do make a strong case for great cooking skills :)
Will definitely visit again.
Top it all off, the Mango Lassi being part of the buffet is simply unheard of."}
{"text":"Yes! So excited to have found this place! The food is phenomenal! My husband and I were craving Indian and wanted something other than the South Indian place we usually go to... I looked in the area and was happy to see India Oven was so close to us. We ordered three dishes (I was hungry, what can I say) and we couldn't be happier with each and every one of them! My husband picked up the order and talked to someone there who said they had been in business for 33 years! You aren't in business for that long if your food isn't good! Not sure what the bad reviewers are talking about?? They must be competitors trying to get business. So happy to have found good Indian nearby!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend for dinner and we ended up both having the dinner buffet.  There was a large selection of delicious dishes and the buffet came with mango lassis and some tandoori chicken.  At $10 each this is a fantastic deal.  In addition, the wait staff was very friendly and kept our drinks topped off.  I'll definitely coming back."}
{"text":"If you have a craving for Indian food, India Oven will foot the bill.  They have a lunch and dinner buffet, and the quality of the food is actually quite good.  They also have a nice selection of both vegetarian and meat dishes.  Samosas are on the buffet menu - sweet!  The buffet also includes mango lasi, which is uncommon but a welcome addition.

Service is very pleasant.  It seems like a family-owned restaurant?  Will return."}
{"text":"Yummm! Friendly, attentive staff. Tasty, authentic Indian dishes in a clean and comfortable setting. And the prices are wonderful too!"}
{"text":"When you enter Indian Oven, you may notice a strange smell. Ignore that. You may notice little man-puppets in the walls, don't ignore that, because they are cool. You may also notice that the staff is friendly, this is because they are cool dudes. At this point, you may notice the prices are a BIT high for what it is, but ignore that for now too. So you ordered, and your food is at your table. Take note of how amazing it is and how you are transported to the gates of heaven. There you will see an angel at the entrance, he will ask your name. You tell him. 

He looks through a book, and starts to get annoyed. \"Oh damnit\" he mutters. \"You're eating at Indian Oven aren't you?\" he asks. You tell him yes, and he asks you to please stay out of the main entry line, this happens often when people eat at Indian Oven.  

You will return to your body, and your body will be happy for what it has inside of it. Yes, the prices were a juuuuust a tiny bit high, but it's vegas, and you could have wasted even more money on a place that totally sucks. 

You will get up, and leave a tip. Bow to the waiter, bow to the owner, exit the building."}
{"text":"Food is good and the Nan is amazing, best in Vegas BUTTTT the staff seem to have trouble with knowing what's on their menu, very frustrating when you order an item on the menu and they have no clue what it is :/"}
{"text":"It was ok. They claim to be the best in Arizona. I hope not. I have only lived here a little while, but, I really hope they aren't the best there is around here. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't awesome. The service could have been better for sure."}
{"text":"I was there for buffet and it was very delicious. The staff is super friendly! What I like the most is the verity of food in the buffet . Lamb, chicken and vegetarian options and all were very tasty."}
{"text":"4th of Jan 2015:

We believed the ratings given in Yelp for this restaurant and here goes sad story of 7 of us. 

I wish I could give a 0 for the Food, Service and Attention paid to the customer. Indians pls stop going there you can never get the taste of authentic indian food here. All you get in return is disappointment and waste of your money. Their main source for ratings is non indians. 

Vegetarian:

Starter - 

Chat - Chana used were rotten and stinking bad. We called the waiter and informed him. He told he would check that and inform me. But he never came back.

Pakoda is too salty...

Alu Bajji is very oily and Alu slices are as big as a whole alu. 

Curry(Vegetables) - 

Paneer gravy - gravy is watery and taste less. Paneer is hard compared to how it is supposed to be.. 

Alu with capsicum - It seemed like an Ayurvedic curry with loadsss of turmeric in it. Again bland and uneatable. 

Palak Paneer - Bland curry palak curry with no paneer in it.

Dal Makhni - Bland tasteless Dal Makhni I have ever had.

Rice - 

Hard, Uncooked basmathi rice. Almost plain rice for vegetarians unlike non vegetarians. 

Deserts - 

Carrot Halwa - Under cooked carrot.

Gulab jam - Unsoaked and saggy from inside. 

Custurd - I could smell chemicals from this. 


Non Vegetarian:
Starter - Very bland chicken. When we asked if they could make it spicier (as we are 6 in number), he gave us a small cup of spicy sause and asked us to use it. If that is what we came for, we can go to Buffalo wild wings instead!!

Rice - Horribly hard and bland rice. 


THE END - when we were still half way through our dinner, they threw the bill book on the table.. What do you want us to do? Come to your restaurant pay and leave with out even having food? Treat INDIANS with respect. 

They charge around $12 per buffet (including tax) I have eaten at many places near ASU campus that take $7 and offer food that is atleast 10000 times better than this.."}
{"text":"Recently we went to lunch buffet but there were not many choices for vegetarian. Most of the items were stale. Will not go to this place again."}
{"text":"The food was good and they have vegetarian options for any one interested. The staff were nice at a provided good service. The only complaint I had was many of the dishes at the buffet stand were dirty and had to be replaced, either do to food not cleaned off of them, or a black dirt that seemed to be on most of the dishes. I would go here again if they could provide cleaner utensils and flatware."}
{"text":"This is kinda my \"Go-To\" for authentic Indian food in the east valley. My wife and I were looking for an Indian place, found this one and loved it and have been back several times since.. Really no bells and whistles, just good Indian food at a good price."}
{"text":"A friend suggested this joint and I was not really sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised, this is the best Indian food I've had in Las Vegas! We enjoyed the garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, and aloo gobi and it was all amazing! I can't wait to go back and do it all over again."}
{"text":"O...M....G....
We tried the dinner buffet and loved it! The price was super reasonable as well. Usually a dish at a regular Indian restaurant would be $13+ but here, all you can eat is $12. Most importantly, the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Don't go for lunch if you plan on trying to enjoy yourself.  Was pushed out the door promptly as they closed at"}
{"text":"Great food, good selection of Indian beers, very friendly staff....Great price too!  Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Wrong orders,  super delayed service,  and no value for customers. We were on a time crunch when we went to try this restaurant for the first time. We specifically requested to suggest us something that we can get faster. 20 min after we get served with wrong food, followed by another wrong order,  and then finally after 40 min of wait,  the waiter comes and tell us that they can't serve us what we ordered because their oven is still heating. After 40 min of wait.  I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Indian buffet! I have only been here for lunch but I have never been disappointed here and always leave uncomfortably full because I just can't stop myself! 

Too many Indian buffets use the same masala base for every dish and just switch out the protein. This place isn't like that, they really are making good North Indian dishes here. My absolute favorite here is the paneer tikka masala. They use real paneer, not that tasteless tofu stuff at other places, and make a seriously rich curry to go along with it. 

I am absolutely positive they put loads of ghee and/or cream in most of the dishes but for an occasional indulgence this place is worth it!"}
{"text":"We arrived about 6:45 pm on a Saturday evening and the place was empty which concerned us a little bit. But it started filling up within an hour and the fragrance and smells from the kitchen started to fill the room. We were very pleased that no loud, modern music blasted the customers like in many restaurants, but instead nice, traditional Indian music in the background so you are still able to talk at your table without raising your voice.
The food we ordered was a traditional sample appetizer, the Chicken Tikka Massala, and the Vegetarian Thali. Also the must-have Garlic Naan. Everything was seasoned and cooked to perfection.
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First visit...greeted immediately, seated with a smile, ambiance nice. Server explained options and answered questions. Water kept filled. Buffet delicious with plenty to choose from, constant fresh items brought out. Sizzling chicken tandoori and more brought to our table...included in amazing price $9.99. Naan bread hot, fresh, delicious. Finished plates removed swiftly, hot Chai tea tasty and included in buffett. Galub Jamun served warm and first time ever I have enjoyed it.  Service impeccable, food fantastic, price amazing...will be back for sure. One thing difficult? Don't try and park out front...side of building if busy, no other complaints."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough fantastic stuff about this place! My husband and I try to come eat once a week, if possible. I recommend them to everyone I come in contact with.

We use to go to another Indian restaurant just down the street, but stopped going there once India Oven opened. From day one we were greeted by the owner so warmly. The buffet has such a great variety or chicken, lamb and vegetarian dishes. Everything is always cooked just right and the flavor is never spicy. The mango lassi is now included with your buffet, all for under $8.00. It is worth drinking. She always refills the container when we arrive :-) They refill your naan repeatedly, always check on you to make sure you are enjoying your meal and the place is always clean. It's the best Indian restaurant I have been to in AZ, and I have tried 3 in Mesa, 2 in Chandler and 3 in Phoenix. 

You've definitely got to try it!"}
{"text":"I had always wanted to try real Indian food and thought I would give this place a try because of all the great reviews and I am glad I did. Now, I don't really know what good Indian food is, but I know that this place has good food. I enjoyed the different meat dishes, but really fell in love with the various vegetarian dishes. Also, the garlic naan was hot and delicious as was the tangy tandori chicken that they served to our table.  

As we were dining, a lady (possibly owner?) checked up on us multiple times and even walked me over to the buffet to explain the dishes to me. I am definitely a fan of this place because for one, the food is delicious and two, they have great customer service."}
{"text":"Food is tasty, service is good, but both myself and dinner guest had ill effects the next day. Buffet food must be heated well if it's returning to service table for a second day"}
{"text":"My family and I have dined here multiple times and we've always had a pleasant experience. Staff is very friendly and attentive. We love the buffet -- yummy and affordable. I also like the mango lassi that comes free with the buffet because it helps me deal with the spice. Oh and don't forget to ask for the naan!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone here several times since moving here from Los Angeles last fall. It is really good Indian food, outstanding service, and a great price.

The vegetable korma is excellent, and the chicken tikka masala is really good. Tandoori chicken is average to good, depending on the visit. The desserts are FANTASTIC! 

Every dish I have tried at IO, I would rate at least good. A few, I would rate as excellent. I haven't had a single bad dish from them. I have only eaten buffet, but have had it at lunch and dinner, weekdays and weekends. 

The food has been hot and fresh tasting every time. The atmosphere is a little cheesy, but the service is fantastic, very friendly and attentive. We will keep going back to India Oven."}
{"text":"The food was horrible never ever going there again even if someone paid me to go promote their restaurant. The lunch buffet yesterday was cold, chicken & lamb was still half raw/uncooked. Naan was to thick and it was rock hard within minutes of been out...."}
{"text":"this is my favorite Indian Buffet.  The food is always fresh and yummy. I took my niece today for her first Indian food and she loved it too.  Highly recommended for food and service"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants, in multiple states, this place ranks with the best of them. Everything is delicious, and priced very well, try it, it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"So delicious. The garlic flat bread is always fresh ND warm. . Chicken Tika is out this world. Rice pudding is stellar. Chicken tandoori is tender. Service is excellent. Thank you!"}
{"text":"As you walk into this place, the aroma that grasps you is like an angel whispering sweet sweet nothings into your nostrils. Each bite is a representation of each level of the heavens. Your heart will leap for joy at the very first bite and grow more and more joyous after each following munch. The heavenly waiters and waitresses stand at the ready to provide refillings of humanities life blood, or water. They provide complimentary unleavened breads that are seasoned to the proverbial bone with exotic spices. The emotional turmoil one goes through when their belly whispers to them, \"no more\" can only be described with a single tear rolling down a somber face.  But from an eye that contains the slight sparkle of hope that one day, maybe one day they can return to this place and feast once more."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a buffet fan, but this place was outstanding. The help bends over backwards to make you happy and the food is wonderful. In addition to the buffet choices, they bring naan and chicken legs directly to your table. Both were incredible. I'll definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Their wait staff is incredibly observant and they always take great care of their customers. But the food. OMG, the food is IMPECCABLE! It is absolutely 100% authentic, and the taste definitely shows that. I could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"We used to drive from Tucson twice a month just to eat here.  That's how good it is!  The entrees were always flavorful and spiced perfectly.  The garlic naan was delicious.   My favorite entree was the sag lamb.  The basmati rice is great too.  It's not the ordinary plain rice you get at most places but it's infused with saffron and other spices.   I have yet to go to another Indian restaurant that does rice so well.  We also tried the lunch buffet.  It's a really unbelievable value at $8.95.  The selection is of quality meat and vegetarian entrees.  The buffet includes drinks like mango lassi and spiced tea as well as hot garlic naan delivered to your table.  I can say that of all the times we went, the service was consistently good.  The staff were very friendly and always refilled our drinks promptly and checked to see how the meal was.  I cannot recommend this place enough.  Now that we moved away, I'm trying to find another Indian restaurant like India Oven.  So far none have come close."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian buffet I've ever been to! We definitely eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Love the service and food! Naan was super soft and the chicken tiki masala was amazing. The mango lassi was also done just right. I would recommend this restraunt to my friends and family. Great ambiance and very authentic Indian food!"}
{"text":"I was unsure about a buffet style Indian restaurant but Wow. The food was spot on and the staff was superb!  I'll be visiting again and again. Everything we tried was delicious and plenty of vegetarian options as well."}
{"text":"Beyond Yummy!  Great Evening Buffet."}
{"text":"Been coming here for the past 2 years .. buffet has good foods to choose from . Vegan buffet also available .. service is good .. I use to dislike how the waiters would sometimes jus stare at you while eating .. luckily that has stoped !! Another dislike is .. I love the fried potatoes but they never make more .. once the first plate on the buffet is gone than it's not replaced which sucks cuz it's a buffet and everyone should have access to It .. over all good food good service .. but not 5 star .. sorry jus can't give them those extra two becuz of things I've encountered !!"}
{"text":"This place is consistent and delicious which is something hard to find! I love that the service is always on top of it, refilling waters, bringing fresh Naan, etc. 
The chicken is always tender and the sauces taste fresh every time. 
I love the variety available for both the meat lover and the vegetarian :-))

I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here several times and every visit is basically identical: delicious food, attentive staff, overall exemplary experience, and a remarkably reasonable bill! My favorite dish is the chicken (or lamb) vindaloo and they will make it super spicy, which is how I like it. There has been only one time where I have had leftovers for the next day-- that's how scrumptious it is. Make it the dinner portion and you receive a naan bread and rice for a nominal extra fee. My wife tends to go for the channa masala, which she always thoroughly enjoys. We usually share the papadum with mango chutney to start (do not miss it) and share an order of the spinach cheese dish (can't remember the name). Everything is phenomenal and the staff is wonderful. They are there when you need them but they do not hover, which I appreciate. But they are super friendly and if you want to have a conversation, they're great. The positive in my opinion of this place is that there are usually not many people here dining (mostly Indian though, so you know this is the real deal) so we have the place relatively to ourselves-- but I want the place to stay in business so please, eat here and give them your business! Of all the Indian places I've eaten at in this town-- and in others-- this one is one of the very few deserving of 5 stars. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars from me! I have been here twice and it has yet to dissapoint! some reviewers say that the food isn't as spicy as it would be if you ordered the dish on its own, while this is true at a buffet you have to appeal to a larger number of people. The flavor is still 100% there! The Tikka is great (one of the best I have tried), as well as the lamb vindaloo, they also have great vegetarian options. The buffet comes with unlimited naan and mango lassi and a plate of tandoori chicken. Overall the service is great and I would eat there every week if I could! :) it is about 9.99 per person, but a great deal!"}
{"text":"The food is EXCELLENT!! We walked in and told the gentlemen we needed a seat for two, he quickly rearranged a nearby table for us to seat two, we waited 30 seconds- literally. Sat down, then got up and went straight to the buffet! We were eating within minutes of arriving! Which is a huge plus if you're accompanied by a very hungry wife. The service was great- our server recommended a very tasty Indian beer which paired well with the lamb masala. They have veggie and non veggie options and the buffet was fresh, we don't eat at many buffets but this one is different. To top it all off and why I gave it five stars is because the check was more than reasonable- 11.95 during dinner time. We both guessed it was around 16-17 dollars because we didn't see a menu and got straight to business eating. 
Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I go often with my family and it does not matter what time we come the food is always hot and fresh. They also remember little things about us and provide excellent service."}
{"text":"Sure, this place may not being the best of the best Indian, but I would recommend this place if someone was looking for an Indian food.

I was on business trip alone, so I didn't want to dine alone in the restaurant so I started to look around what I should have for To-Go.
Indian food came in to my mind so I yelped.   

I had a very specific request.  My request was something that wasn't on the menu, I wanted to have Keema Chicken.   

so, I called 2 other places before I landed to the India Oven.   The first 2 places I called, both said No, can't make keema chicken because it's not on the menu.   

And finally I called India Oven, I asked the same question, he said \"No problem, we can make Keema chicken for you\"   

That's the attitude!   Keema chicken normally is NOT on the menu at many Indian restaurants.  It is because Keema(means ground/minced) chicken is more like home cooking and not really the type of food that the restaurants serves. (I don't know why they shouldn't!) 

As I eat alots of Indian food and know exactly what I wanted to eat, I didn't even check the menu.  I ordered Keema chicken, Plain Naan, Rice, Papadums and Raita. 

Their Keema chicken was good.  A lots of ginger as I expected.  Exactly what I had in mind.  I wish they put green pees but was not a big deal. 
Papadum was spicy and crispy.  I ordered extra so that I can snack tomorrow night!!   

Naan was great, fresh and chewy. Just as Naan bread should taste.  I stick with plain, I don't like those Garlic and the other flavor ones because I want to taste the floury doughy Naan.  It was really good.  I only wish if they didn't use so much oil when they bake the Naans but not a big deal, I liked it alot.  Like I said in beginning, There are better Indians all over the country and I had a better one before.  

Anywayz, My bottom line is,  If you ask something off the menu and they still accommodate you,  that's right there they earned a good score and  some good reviews.   That's the way a good service supposed to be like. 

Kudos to them and that's why I give 4 stars.  (I often order something off the menu, there are some restaurant that are happy to do that for you and this place is one of them) 

The interiors/decor are pretty cheesy typical Indian style.  Almost like decor in 80s. But we all have places to enjoy atmosphere already, this place isn't that kind.  


Again, It is highly recommended.  I would definitely go back.  The staff were all nice and friendly, the owner came out and said hi to me too and I was just a To-Go customer."}
{"text":"Consistently great!  Buffet style and kind of a hole in the wall type restaurant, but some of the best Indian food I've found.  Staff is pleasant and attentive.  Looking for a nice date night and all dressed up?  Go somewhere else.  Looking for excellent food at a very reasonable price and comfortable going out to dinner in shorts and flip flops?  This is the place!"}
{"text":"SUMMARY: Very good authentic Indian food, friendly and attentive staff, clean location. Definitely going back.

THE PLACE: Plenty of parking, around the building. The main door to the restaurant is on the side facing Gilbert Road. It is attached to a banquet hall and smoke shop, that many probably mistake for the entrance, judging by the number of signs directing folks to the entrance of the restaurant. Inside, ample size, from a few booths by the walls and tables in the middle. Going as a big group? I think they can accommodate, but I would call ahead to make sure as, I don't think the space can accommodate several big groups at the same time.

THE FOOD: It's buffet at lunch AND DINNER. Yes, dinner! $9.95 for lunch and $11.95 for dinner. This price include Indian Tea and Mango Lassi, plus Garlic Naan -- all part of the buffet. We went on a Saturday for lunch and tried a little of every offering:
- Lamb Vindaloo
- Lamb dish -- sadly, hubby and I cannot remember the name.
- Malai Kofta -- FAVORITE
- Saag -- FAVORITE with Garlic Naan. Yummy!
- Tandoori Chicken -- it was very good. Looked dry, but it wasn't at all. And it was well seasoned.
- Paneer Tikka Masala
- Don't miss out on dessert too - Gulab Jamon, Kulfi, and Kheer (my fave).

THE SERVICE: The staff was super attentive. They made sure used plates are taken before you are even back at your table. They kept the Indian Iced Tea coming too and the Garlic Naan. I didn't know all of the dishes there, so I had to ask, and they patiently explained and answered our questions."}
{"text":"Tasteless! The food is tasteless (vindaloo, masala). First time tasteless Indian. Moreover just a single \"slice\" of bread included. It is also overpriced. Man very nice, girl very unfriendly. The quality if raw material I think is good, but the overall result really disappointing"}
{"text":"Love this place! Buffet all the way! Food always seems fresh and flavorful and they keep the naan flowing! Also love the extra touch with the mango drink that's complimentary. Love that it's family owned by Sikhs from the Punjab region. Service is great and the Bollywood shows playing in the background are always fun. 

Only downers I can think of are the location is a little difficult with both medians and parking in front of the restaurant (the narrow area dead ends) or parking a bit further away and having to walk past the neighboring smoke shop and frequently getting a whiff of smoke. But the great food and service will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed by this restaurant! It's simply delicious food for a great price. I will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"i am a pig. i tried everything they offered and i liked every bit of it. the tikki masala was my favorite but i truly enjoyed everything i ate. i think i spent 12 dollars for lunch total. i left a 20 because i ate so much. cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with the boyfriend last night. We've been a little underwhelmed by the food choices in Vegas during our trip, especially for the inflated price. So, I looked up places a little off the beaten path and found this. It was definitely worth it! I got the Chicken Makhani dinner and he got the Non-vegetarian Thali, both were delicious and came with a huge piece of naan. For about $20 a person it was the best dinner we've had so far and more food than we could finish. Our waiter was very attentive and the food came out quickly. The good news is it's only half a block from the SLS station on the monorail so it's easy to get to. The semi-bad news is that the area is a little sketchier than you might like. Either way i'd happily visit again!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here and thought the food was delicious!!! For the price, I felt like I DEFINITELY got my money's worth. Fresh naan and spiced dishes was fantastic! And all you can eat was even better!"}
{"text":"Really good food.  I go there for lunches occasionally and it's always delicious!

They have both meat and vegetarian dishes and desserts.  It's not a huge selection but I haven't yet tried a dish that I didn't like."}
{"text":"Been hearing about this place from a couple people. It was very tasty and had a good selection for the buffet. $25 including tip for 2 is a very good deal to me! I only gave it 4 stars because they didn't give you a hot sizzling chicken tandoori on an iron cast skillet. Maybe I'm spoiled for expecting that since I'm from Chicago originally. They give you one every time. Otherwise, really good food. I was full after 2 plates only..."}
{"text":"My visits to this little gem all started a few years ago before I went to grad school. I was very sad to leave the Phoenix area as I knew I would not have India Oven in my life for a while. But then when I found myself back in the valley after graduation I was SO pleased to see that nothing has changed. 

The quality is still excellent and the service is always welcoming and attentive. My favorite aspect about the buffet is that tea and mango lassis are included which is a welcomed treat, IMO. Lots of dishes to choose from for those of us who don't consume meat and lots of options for those who do. The atmosphere is cool and comfortable on a hot day. 

The only thing that keeps me from giving a full five star grade for this review has to do with variety. I think that the establishment could mix up 'the usual dishes' now and then to keep those of us who frequent the restaurant often enticed.

Bottom line, GO CHECK OUT INDIA OVEN. This local family owned restaurant will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"The samosas were good. Chicken and prawn tikka masala had some flavor to it. The Naan was just heavenly. Indian food is the type of food that you eat when you are in the mood. The service is OK. They also have a lunch buffet. However, the prices for dinner menu can get a bit expensive."}
{"text":"FABULOUS buffet! We come in for lunch whenever we can and are never disappointed. Their Naan is served freshly made and with garlic. YUM! Free Lassi with the buffet too!"}
{"text":"For those of you, who know the Valley, you probably have a good idea how far Goodyear is from Mesa  (for those of you not familiar, think San Francisco to Los Angeles ... LOL).  Nevertheless, we were prepared to run the gauntlet of rush hour traffic, crazy weekend drivers and take an overnight bag with us to try out this restaurant with spectacular reviews.  And once again, the Valley's populace has NOT let me down:  apparently, only ex-cons who suffered with prison food and people who've lost their sense of taste (both physical and mental) give 4 and 5 stars on Yelp to ANYTHING.

First, let me say, that this restaurant's employees couldn't do more to make your dining experience a pleasant one:  they're friendly, very attentive and respond quickly to any request you could throw at them.  

I haven't seen many Indian restaurants, which serve buffets at night, so I was curious to see how this place stacked up against other Indian places I've been to.  The decor is ... interesting.  From the ground level to about 7 feet up, the decor is homey and reminds you of Cheers-gone-Diner.  Above 7 feet, the decor can best be described as \"condemned factory\".  But okay ... while decor is important in enjoying your meal, it's not necessarily a deal breaker ... if the food makes up for it.  Sadly, this is not the case.  While I give the restaurant overall two stars, I would specifically rate the food as  \"two-flushes\"  (figure it out, if you dare!).  I'm sorry, but this just happens to be one of those places that support my argument against low-flow toilets.  It's not that the food looks unappetizing; it's just that, well, it IS:  oversalted food; dry tandoori chicken; thin-sauce chicken tikki masala (and that was the BEST dish).  The na'an was okay ... actually, I liked it because it's thick; my other half likes the na'an thin and crispy.  Funny enough, the place was absolutely packed  (no doubt only with people who could prove they usually give at least 4 stars on their Yelp reviews).  

I really wanted to give this place a stellar review, not the least, because its employees are top notch.  Unfortunately, when you come home to go to the bathroom after dinner and your dog runs away yelping with his tail between his legs, there's not much else to say.

Truly sorry, guys."}
{"text":"Once upon a time this was a good place to get decent Indian food...alas they have changed chef/management and now it very poor quality.. I ordered Tikka Masala; it was, I am sure a sauce from Sharwoods that I can buy, plus the meat was huge chunks of chook...and the veggie rice I ordered was nothing more that boiled rice with some microwaved veggies thrown in,,,,will never go back..."}
{"text":"The food here was so good that it reminded me who I was in my past life. I really enjoy this place, and I've been here multiple times. My only complaint is that I'm tired of eating alone, but I suppose that has nothing to do with any of the restaurants I patronize."}
{"text":"My brother and I are both vegans so finding estaurants with really good food that accomodate vegans is a challenge. We were wonderfully surprised when we found Indian Oven in Gilbert Arizona. It was fabulous, so tasty and the service was impeccable. We visited a second time during our vacation ( I wish we had eaten there every night!). I highly recommend it whether you are vegan or not, everything looked wonderful and delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here just because its inexpensive and tasty. Great selection of both meat and meatless entrees. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding, the service was good, the price was high. I was in no way disappointed by the quality, presentation or ANYTHING about India Oven, but the price for entrees here is shocking, particularly when rice or breads are not included in it.  Treat yourself to the food here, just cope ahead of time with the $30 per person price for lunch. 

The decor is nice generic white tablecloth, the building unremarkable and the location not upscale, so these can't be the cost basis.  Maybe the buffet is cheaper, but I ordered from the menu so I could get the amazing onion bagee and a standard, but non-buffet entree, which was $17.  FYI, the little strip mall it's in is a pit--without having reached graffiti and boarded-up window status--but the food was stunning!  If you like/eat Indian food as much as I do, you'll want to visit India Oven.  If it weren't for the entree prices, I'd have given it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep it short, everything was amazing!  The naan was great, carrot pudding was great, service... EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the naan was especially good. It was our first time going and I did feel a bit awkward. It seemed like the servers expected us to know that to do. Don't get me wrong, everyone was very nice and courteous, I just felt a little uncertain of how to proceed after I walked in the door. The restaurant is also really small and dark. These are nitpicky things. The food was amazing and the place seemed clean. Those are the things that count."}
{"text":"Spectacular!! Absolutely the best!! No where in town do you get piping hot flaky naan where you can actually taste the butter....no where else in town does the owner who is also the chef come and mingle with guests...Even at the buffet each flavorful dish tastes like it was just made for u personally.  The atmosphere..the decor..the service.. and the ambiance is like no other in Vegas!  Thats why I keep coming here after 10 years!!.....Michael"}
{"text":"I admit I had my  reservations about coming to an Indian food buffet, but this place pleasantly surprised me. $9.95 for the dinner buffet & $7.95 for lunch.

There are not as many choices as one would expect from a buffet, but the food is so good that you won't be bothered - the chicken marsala was my favorite. I love the tea that comes free with the buffet (along with mango smoothies). And they automatically bring garlic naan bread (delicious!) and chicken tandoori as an appetizer - free!

The staff is extremely friendly & attentive - my glass never reached half empty. While I appreciate it, they are almost TOO attentive at times, to the point where it's slightly uncomfortable. Also, they don't assign one waiter to a table, just whoever is available checks on you, which brings a lot of repetition - as satisfied as I was, I didn't want to have to keep telling each individual waiter I was doing OK every 5 minutes. 

Still, India Oven serves wonderful food and I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I have always driven past here and heard of how good it is. Boy were they right. The Chicken Tika Masala was my favorite with rice and all wrapped in a piece of the unlimited supply of garlic naan. There is a type of mango drink that reminds me of naked juice more than anything else, it is fantastic. The desserts leave something to be desired, which is the only reason im not giving a 5 star. The syrup bread balls are a little soggy, but the mango pudding was my favorite of the desserts."}
{"text":"I simply cannot believe the 4 1/2 star average rating for this restaurant. We went to India Oven excited to enjoy the food so many of you reviewed so highly. I can't recommend this place enough if you love chicken knuckles and weird, sinewy pieces of mystery meat in your lackluster Indian food. This was easily one of the worst dining experiences of my entire life. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"This is truly one of my absolute favorite restaurants in the Valley. I have started reviews on this place several times before, but don't post it because I feel like my review doesn't do this place the justice they deserve. Well today I am probably still not going to be able to accurately describe how amazing this place is, but I want to give them my 5 stars already!!

India Oven is such a great treat and I have NEVER once been disappointed in this restaurant. As much as I frequent here, it bewilders me that the food has never let me down. And I know it won't - they are so consistent here. 

I hate buffets, but this is not your average buffet. The food is of the highest quality and you can tell it is authentic and that so much care went into its creation. It is so savory and the spices are always perfect. I love how there is a separation of vegetarian dishes from meat dishes, and there is an equal number of each to choose from. The prices are fair and the staff is great. I have never once had an empty cup of water while dining here. The waiters are the most professional here than I have seen anywhere else before. They are kind, respectful, attentive, yet they never come over too much or interrupt your meal by trying to start conversation that they don't actually care about. They are amazing, just like the food. 

Please give this place a shot as you will not be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best indian food i've had in a long time. Lots of vegetarian options. Excellent food."}
{"text":"For a modern day restaurant you would think that they would be more aware of people's dietary needs, such as being allergic to dairy. I understand this isn't usual but they had seemed unapologetic about helping me. The rice plate I ended getting wasn't the best. The price was okay per person."}
{"text":"As in previous reviews,  India Oven is by far the best India food I've EVER eaten. The owner's truly appreciate your business too. All staff are very pleasant and fast to serve. Your water glass is never past half full. They are very proud of their food and should be. They never forget acknowledge return customer's. Everyone is always smiling. The food is consistently fantastic. I personally recommend you try India Oven. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Attentive staff. Reasonable prices.  This place was a good find on Yelp.  The food was excellent and the staff was very accommodating and pleasant (never an empty glass or dirty plate on your table for more than 15 seconds : )  ."}
{"text":"Lots of variety for a $8.95 lunch buffet! The Samosa was delicious and the buffet included garlic naan and mango lassi. Carrot Halwa and Gulab jamun were good too. There were other desserts too but I didn't try them. Perhaps next time!"}
{"text":"Reasonable Buffet.

Unlimited Nan and Garlic Nan
Very Good: Garlic Nan, Tandoori Chicken"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp and was not disappointed....food was fantastic.  My favorite dish was even on the buffet...mali kofta.  The service was quick and they even brought out fresh hot chicken and lamb for my son (this in included in the buffet price of $9.95). This restaurant is everything I had hoped for...great value, delicious food and amazing service."}
{"text":"Indian food is one of my family's favorite types, so we went here to try the place out and see how it was.  Inside were some Indian themed wall paintings, vases, Metalworking, etc.  We couldn't decide what to get so we just went for the buffet.  The Palak Paneer was a bit mild (yet it was the buffet) nevertheless, the food was rich with flavor.  The owners were nice and showed us a back room where parties could be held.  All in all the place was amazing, one of the best Local Indian Kitchens in the valley, can't wait to come back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Definitely my go-to Indian place in Mesa. It's on the way home so I mostly swing by for lunch. 
I like how everything is included with the buffet. 
You don't have to pay extra for naan. Nothing extra for the mango thingy (not sure I'd that's the technical term though ).
At any rate, its always hot and good and hits the spot. 
Typically, they are pretty attentive to drink and naan needs. Sometimes I'll wait a bit for naan but usually it isn't too long. 
I'm adding a review after about 15 or so visits. I've really never left disappointed. 
The bang for the buck is pretty outstanding. Really good food for $13 is a slam dunk."}
{"text":"Tasteless dinner. I would never go back to this place. They had buffet for Sunday dinner. Although they had a lot of food choices but none had good taste to it except their desserts. You see paneer was so watery. It annoys me that a restaurant in business can't serve good food to their customers. 2 stars for chat and dessert only!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best find I've made in the last two years.

If you are ever in Mesa, this is the place to go for Indian food that is stellar quality and perfectly done. I've been to places where the focus is just on making your mouth and entire body burn from just the heat of the spice, but not at all flavorful. This is absolutely NOT the case here. There is a good amount of heat to some of their dishes, but it is flavorful and wonderfully balanced. 

Service was courteous, friendly and very attentive. Everything tasted fresh, the interior was clean and well kept."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Los Angeles and we were trying to get lucky with a legit Indian spot. Walked in and jumped in the buffet only to see 2 roaches crawling between the food bins. Luckily I had ordered a Haywards beer before we got up for the buffet. We notified the workers and they apologized but probably should've comped my Haywards. If you like chicken tikka roaches, give it a visit."}
{"text":"I have now been to India Oven at least 6 times, all for the dinner buffet.  Each and every time the food has been fresh, hot and extremely good. It is hard to beat a dinner buffet that also includes fresh naan and tandoori chicken. In fact my PICKY 5 year old can eat the chicken tikka every day and be extremely happy.

The only problem with putting up a good review here is that we like it being a hidden gem....we don't want to have to fight off the crowds!"}
{"text":"I don't know what they put in their food but I am addicted!

It is the BEST indian food that I ever had. The owners and staff are all very friendly and do a great job. 

My fav is the dinner buffet. You have quite a big assortment of food you can choose from. My absolute long time favourite is the Chicken Tiki Masala and the Lamb Vindaloo. They are to die for. Perfect amount of spices! My boyfriend and I come here since they first opened and the quality of food and service has always stayed the same ehen not even got better! They imported a chef from India. So you can be sure that the food is very authentic.
In addition to the buffet they serve delicious garlic naan and chicken on a sizzling plate. Plus the price is unbeatable.

I am in love with this place and can't get enough of it. A hidden gem! They also have a banquet hall for groups of people."}
{"text":"It was good but not spectacular. Quite average in overall taste. The staff were pleasant enough. The big pull here is the buffet, which is decent but again over hyped. The biggest thing I noticed was it wasn't clean. I got a glimpse of the kitchen and I doubt I'd return. The Christmas lights that adorn the buffet have grease on them and the dust has collected all over them."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and the food was very mediocre. The chicken looked so bad that I only decided to go for the vegetarian dishes. The Naan bread was partly cold and not crispy. Bah! I had better Indian food. I think the best indian food in town is the Himalayan. Unfortunately they don't have lunch buffet anymore.The only good point: the place looked clean."}
{"text":"I have been there five times now. Finally decided to write a review. Excellent food, prompt service, friendly waiters, reasonably priced, great garlic bread that they keep bringing to your table. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The food is delishhhhh......great service,,, try the curried Lamb.. took a friend who had never been there or had Indian food....he loved it... great place, don't miss it."}
{"text":"I don't eat Indian food often (love it but it is very high calorie) but tried the dinner buffet last night. Can't beat it for $12 as there is a lot of variety.  Food excellent so was service.  Read some less than 5 reviews and can't figure out what these people are complaining about.  I got drink refills and hot naan bread about every 5 minutes.  My only complaint is I walked out stuffed and had to take some Tums when I got home :).  Place is excellent."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in the valley hands down!  Fantastic and personal service. I always get a warm welcome when I eat there."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indian Restaurant in town!  It's been around for awhile too.
I remember going to the old location before they moved to the new location.  The service is still the best and the food is still wonderful like it always has been.  If your looking for Indian food then don't waste your time going anywhere else.  At least you 
can rest assured that you will get what your looking for at a fair price here.  This time I used the Yelp offer $15 or $25 and they gladly accepted it with no problem.  It's always good to eat something different every now and then.  I have no complaints and will recommend India Oven to others!"}
{"text":"The food was authentic tasting. Had flavor and wasn't bland. The only complaint I had was the food wasn't \"hot\" it was room temperature. But overall for a Indian Resturant in Las Vegas it was good."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite places to eat indian food.  I would always get the veggie thali and a chai.  They are very nice there."}
{"text":"Great and consistent food, a well priced buffet, and owners who really care about the customer and their experience make India Oven a favorite date night restaurant for my wife and I."}
{"text":"This place has an excellent buffet with varied options for every diet. The food is amazing and at a decent price. I often  bring guests from out if town to India Oven and it's always a hit."}
{"text":"I don't remember how I came across or heard about this place but I supposed I just happened to stumble here. 

I was looking for a good place for my boyfriend and myself to eat - just something close by and have a nice dinner. We're always up for trying new places and this happened to be one of them.

Read all the reviews and looked at the pictures which various visitors took during their stay there and found them all to be persuasive - I must say even my boyfriend was convinced when he saw the picture of the owner (who is ethnically indian) .

We decided to go around dinner time since we were doing chores around the house and I figured it would be a slow dinner rush so we wouldn't be in the middle of it. 

We arrived around 9pm to find the place not as full but mostly it was just two small parties while the rest of the small restaurant was empty. I was very exciting and entered with my boyfriend. As soon as we both went in, I heard some bollywood music playing in the background, several flat tv screens placed around the small area showing indie music videos and as I looked forward I saw abound 4 indie men dressed in white dress shirts and black slacks - all looking professional - but one of them was wearing a turban and had a full nicely trimmed beard. 

We were soon seating in a very comfortable booth, by one of the bussers/hosts and visited by another - the man in the turban whose english was very hard to understand because I only heard a few words that I could recognize. We both gave each other looks and just nodded our heads and went with it. I had to giggle afterwards because I just was too embarrassed to say anything but I'm sure the guy meant well.

I was so excited and we both got up to grab some food from the buffet. According to the pictures that i saw - the buffet looks big - might I need to remind you that pictures don't do justice and you must go see it for yourself. The buffet was very small with two sections: non-vegetarian and vegetarian. We were in the non-vegetarian section scooping small portions of food that we did not know the english translations to but eagerly tried out what we could fit on our plates.

I have to say I was too shy to even look around but I am sure the next time I go there I'll know the drill ;)

we got to our seats and began eating. I was very hungry so the food tasted really good. I am sure if I was moderately hungry the food probably would tasted differently but at that time it tasted so good that I was surprisingly full ^_^

We were talking and analyzing about each portion of food we had and the garlic naan is reallllyyyy good!!!

However our stay was short lived as we were greeted again by the turban man - He told us that they were closing in 5 minutes and we just smiled and nodded our heads but as he left I was sadden and my boyfriend was just not satisfied to hear that.

The place DOES close AT 10pm which means that  as customers we can stay there til it actually closes but it seems to me that they can make up when they want to close regardless of the hours they have posted on here.

As much as I enjoyed the good food and the groovy atmosphere, I would really NOT recommend to go there at 9pm or after because you will only have at least 20 minutes or less to shovel food down your mouth and be asked to leave - really that is rude and poor customer service.

If you want to enjoy the food and savor the taste and environment, I would suggest you eat lunch and have an early dinner before 9pm - unless you want the turban man or someone who doesn't speak english and has unpredictable body language to tell you that you need to leave so they can close and go home early before the actual time of the place closes.

My boyfriend wanted to generously leave a tip because everything was really satisfying but to be asked to leave when they don't even close really didn't earn them the tip they should have gotten.

However we will come back just not after 9pm"}
{"text":"We came in from out of town. I wanted to introduce the kids and the boyfriend to Indian food. I was not disappointed. I will be visiting again when we move closer. The food was delicious, the service was great and the atmosphere was comfortable. Definitely love this place!"}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet today for the first time, although I've had the dinner buffet 3-4 times.  Every time I come here the food is amazing and there is a really good selection and variety of both meat and vegetarian options.  The free mango lassi is also a bonus.  The naan is always really good as well.  The service is always great.  I've been to many Indian restaurants and this is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"First time in: Saturday lunch time. Good impression, the place was packed. We took the Buffet. Usual variety of dishes. Everything was perfectly cooked, very flavorful and piping hot. Only negative remark, the lady tried to take my dish away, while I was still eating... However there were six people waiting for a table as we were waiting... We will be back and we will eat À La Carte the next time."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment! Had food delivered from here - missing lots of food! Can't believe we paid what we paid for this tiny amount of food. They didn't even include dipping sauces for the samosas. We called to discuss with management and they said our order was fine. We couldn't disagree more. There are so many great Indian restaurants, try another that doesn't cut corners!"}
{"text":"good stuff like the avail dinner buffet others only do lunch buffets but who wants do buffet at lunch"}
{"text":"I liked the buffet they had because they had mango lassi and the cups they had for them was cute. Of the dishes they had out at the buffet, I liked most of them. The chicken tikka masala and the paneer tikka masala sauces were good. I could definitely taste the difference between the paneer tikka masala and the chicken tikka masala. The goat dish tasted like beef, which I liked because it didn't taste gamey like the lamb dishes do. They also had gulab ja moon as well as a mango pudding. The mango pudding seemed to have fruit cocktail mixed into it as well because I found pieces of pear and maraschino cherries in it. The naan had a garlic topping with some green onion pieces on it. It was slightly more toasted than I would have liked. Overall, I think I would go back again, especially for the mango lassi."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch buffet. Clean. Waitstaff was very attentive. They ran out of tandoori chicken on the buffet and then hand delivered a small plate to each table when it was ready."}
{"text":"Favorite Indian food in AZ. The staff is friendly, my father is a regular and they know him by name. Buffet is so good, and it tastes so flavorful. The naan is also very good and my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Wonderful service and excellent food, at a great price.  I wish I didn't move from this side of town and could go here more often.  And they have a dinner buffet, soooo yummy!"}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but this restaurant deserved my time. I highly recommend NOT to go to this restaurant to anyone!
Where do I start? From the sub-standard food to the unacceptable behavior of the people, this place was an utter disappointment! The restaurant hours for dinner are 5 PM-10PM. But nowhere in their website does it say that buffet closes at 9:30...
On a Friday night we got off work really late and so along with my 4 friends we arrived in the restaurant around 9:30... they said they would close the buffet in 10 mins or so but would hold on for us a little more... we were like ok so we sat for the dinner...most of the dishes were there except some starter pakodas and the biriyani was almost out... we started to eat but they kept on rushing us... and at 9:40 they took all the food from the buffet without even informing us! When we asked about dessert, they asked which one we wanted! And when we said we would like try all of the buffet options they started arguing with us... they lied through their teeth  about not rushing us and about saying that they would hold on for us... they said something about the kitchen boys leaving at 9:30 (then why does it say that they close at 10?)
This is unacceptable! We know we were late... They could have easily told us that the buffet is closed and we would have respected that because we were late. But once you have accepted your customers... you should not be behaving in such a manner. We did not ask to refill a dish that was out... we simply asked for dishes that were still present in good quantities! one of the waiters got so angry that he was banging the plates against each other as he took them from our table!
I have been to buffets that were nearing their closing hours but never have I experienced such behavior and utter disregard from the service providers...
I would give negative stars but there is no option for that!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service, highly suggest the Flying Horse lager.
I love the lunch and dinner buffet but the regular menu is amazing too."}
{"text":"Great service.  Food was pretty good, they have a really good mix of food in their buffet which was nice since we brought along some friends who had never had Indian food before.  Skip the Samosas they aren't as good as some that I have had.  I would defiantly go back maybe for lunch so we could get the cheaper buffet price."}
{"text":"Plenty of vegetarian options and plenty of GREAT FOOD OH MY GOSH EVERYTHING IS SO GOOD. Great price for the quality and quantity (it's mainly a buffet, however you can order off a menu). My friend says the goat is phenomenal, and I could eat 30 samosas and dip it in all the sauces. The rice is very aromatic and the naan is a perfect dipping tool for every entree dish. I forgot what dishes were my favorites, but every single thing was delicious and had the perfect level of spice. The spinach makes spinach-haters convert. All the staff is very attentive in filling water and making light conversation. India Oven is definitely worth the 10ish dollars for what you get. A must-visit. Plus with a bowling alley so close, you could eat some good food and have a party right after at AMF."}
{"text":"Many gluten free options for those with Celiac or allergy.  Very attentive staff with delicious food.  A great neighborhood find!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was very fast. Checked on us often. Naan is always the big question at an Indian restaurant. Theirs is great. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on my day off. Been wanting to try this place for a while. It's location right next to a head shop is a little dubious, but once you go in, no worries. 

The inside is clean, nicely decorated; a few murals and TVs playing Bollywood. Indian restaurants always flaunt a fully stocked bar with top end whiskeys and scotch. Does anyone ever drink there? The staff was extremely polite. I was seated and went to the buffet.

All of the standard dishes were there. The food was fresh. The rice cooker with basmati in it had a cinnamon stick mixed in, I thought that was cool. Tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, chicken curry , palak paneer (although it had baby corn in it instead, interesting), aloo gobi, and a few other veggie dishes. All tasted great. The dal was spicy, but in a warm way. The waiter brought garlic naan and tandoori chicken , which was excellent. 

I love the desserts. Gulab jamun, kheer , and mango custard. All delicious. There was also complimentary mango lassi, which missed. Everything was great, the servers were really on top of things without being pushy. I'll definitely make more stops here."}
{"text":"Went there Wed with some coworkers for dinner. Food was good and authentic, really enjoyed the waitstaff as they were very attentive."}
{"text":"After reading a few reviews on the place I had to try it. I've passed by it for years never paying much attention to it. 

I must agree with past reviewers...the food is good. But, sometimes it's not always just about the food. The service was outstanding. I was greeted at the door with a smile, and when I met my party at the table, the server was right on top of serving water and asking what we would like, if anything else to drink. 

I felt like a giant to our server, and the gentleman was extremely kind, courteous and helpful in explaining the different dishes presented at the buffet. The food was flavorful! 

I highly recommend this place if you're looking for good Indian food."}
{"text":"First time to the India Oven. Been at the Indian food place down the street and really like it. But I think India Oven is just a tad better. Service was GREAT! Went for lunch and had the buffet.  SO good!  We were never looking for a server to get more naan! I enjoyed everything I had. I had to practice some real restraint to not go back for more, but I didn't want to overeat and end up falling asleep at my desk.  You gotta try this place. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best Naan Bread we've ever had.  The buffet was reasonably priced, and the customer service was outstanding.  The food was tasty and fresh.  Definitely worth a try if you're in the mood for Indian Food."}
{"text":"Love it!  Food is great and the Nan YUMMY! Great service! Waiters wait on your every need."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. The place is very clean. The price is right too. Four of us ate the buffet and we got out for $36.00! What can I say...this place is the BOMB! Try it. You'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"FOOD WAS EXCELLENT 

fast service

good selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods

person answering the fone was very pleasant personable and helpful

I came in last minute at 225pm for buffet

delicious food - high recommend"}
{"text":"Food is a 5, service is a 4, location is a 3, wine list is a 3.  I ordered a hot Chicken Jalfrezy it was perfect.  Usually no place will make it spicy enough for me.    The Naan was also outstanding."}
{"text":"Wow was this a find. My girlfriend was in the mood for Indian food and found this place on Yelp so I met her there for dinner. Small little Mom and Pop place. Everyone who works there is really nice. The inside is really nice. Although it doesn't look like much on the outside but some of the best places don't. For $9 or $10 for all you can eat it is a great deal. They also have Indian beers that are not IPAs. I'm not a big fan of IPAs so for them to have something else was great. I don't remember the name of it but I would drink it again.
The buffet is great with a lot of different things to pick from. Of course we had to try the Tikka Masala which was really good. So was the garlic naan bread that they bring to the table.
We only made two trips to the buffet before we were full but it was so good you didn't want to stop eating. We will definitely be back. This goes to the top of the list as my favorite place to go for Indian food."}
{"text":"This is a review for their buffet. Mmmmm this place is very good! I like how all the food was fresh and the service was great! They made us feel very welcomed and were really nice. Everything I ate was delicious, there wasn't one thing I didn't like! The prices were also very fair. We will be returning very soon, even again this week."}
{"text":"Second trip a few trips ago... I asked for extra spices... I don't know why... Considering my previous review... Yes, the food was very spicy, yet the taste and quality overshadowed the pain...I'm going back to \"spicy\"!"}
{"text":"This was a huge disappointment and because of the owner's arguing with us, we will not go back.
Our first visit to this place was exceptional.  The food was awesome, the service was awesome, we said that we would definitely go back.
Fast forward to March 19th, 2015.  We were on that end of Mesa and decided to go back.  Mouth watering and stomachs empty we went in.  The smells were palatable.  Curry and spices filled the air, our mouths started watering and our stomachs started to growl.  We sat down and ordered the buffet.  It's not a large buffet but the food, the last time, was beyond good.  We went to the buffet with great anticipation.  As we looked over the selections we noticed one thing, they had sprinkled cilantro over everything, not just a little, a lot..  To most not a big deal. However my wife detests cilantro much in the same why I detest cheesecake (I know I'm weird).  To her and a portion of the country, cilantro tastes like soap (google it if you don't believe).  When we reached our table, the tandoori chicken and naan was waiting for us.  The first thing we noticed was the naan bread was covered in cilantro.  After picking through the dishes on the buffet my wife had selected a small portion of a couple of the dishes but if you have ever used cilantro you know the taste can be overwhelming and it was.  She said don't worry about it.  When one of the waiters came over, the guy that wears the turbine, I asked if we could have some of the naan without the cilantro.  I also asked if it would be possible to get a portion of the tiki masala without all of the cilantro.  He said I could but I would have to order off of the regular menu.  I knew it was a long shot but I thought I would take a chance  Anyway, he rolled his eyes and walked away.  At that point we were not even sure if we were going to get the bread.  After a few moments he came back, basically threw the plate on the table and put four pieces of burnt naan on it.  We both said \"thank you so much\".  He just walked away.  Later he came back and asked if I wanted more water.  I said yes.  He picked the glass up, filled it and then slammed it back down on the table.  Later the lady that is always there walked by and asked if everything was ok.  I just shrugged and said it was ok.  She asked if there was a problem.  I explained to her that the last time we were there they did not have cilantro all over everything.  She then began to tell me I was wrong and that they always had done that.  She also told me that they used ground cilantro in everything.  At that point my wife said. \"That's it were done.\"  The lady was standing in her way by the booth.  My wife said excuse me we are leaving.  I went up to pay the bill and the lady said that they used cilantro in everything.  I told her that I didn't think she understood what I was saying.  I said that the last time we were here the food was awesome and that they, in fact, did not have everything coated in cilantro.  Again she said I was wrong, which I am not and she tried to make excuses.  It's one thing to try to explain something to a customer, it's another to argue with them and constantly tell them they are wrong.  It could have been handled so much better.  Anyway, not going back."}
{"text":"I decided to drive across town today to try the buffet here after searching and reading the reviews. i was not disappointed because this is the best Indian buffet I have found in Az! 

The food was a step up from everything else I have tried, excellent selection with delicious spices. I thought the food was a bit spicier than the average buffet and I really like it that way. 

Service was very friendly and attentive, it could not have been any better. 

Well worth the drive across town, I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good variety of Indian food for a reasonable price, then this is the perfect place to come to! 

For the $12 dinner buffet, you have access to all the main Indian staples such as lamb vindaloo, chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, samosas, basmati rice, vegetarian options, and much more! There is also mango lassi, chai tea, mango and rice pudding. The staff are super friendly and they constantly fill your water cups and ensure that you have enough garlic naan. The dishes are fresh and constantly replenished because this place is so popular. But keep in mind that it's frowned upon to be wasteful so practice being in the clean plate club! (There's an extra fee if you leave a lot of uneaten food). 

It has been in establishment since the 1980s and can accommodate large groups. They are adjacent to a banquet hall and have a full bar so they have the capacity for special celebrations. I would love to bring a group of my friends here next time!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the reason elastic-waist pants were invented.  The food is outstanding - the best Indian food I've had since I left NYC.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  They have a great selection of dishes for their all-you-can-eat buffet meals.  Plenty of choices for carnivores and vegetarians alike.  My husband (who is new to Indian food) is amazed at how, \"Everything has a distinct taste but it all goes so well together.\"  And you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"I love it here! I only have gone here a couple of times for the buffet but I think thats the smart way to go!

I had my first Indian food experience here so I have nothing to really compare to. I did have the buffet during lunch and dinner and there are only minor differences but the food is always delicious! I love how they bring hot garlic naan out to your table and refill it once its gone. 

I love trying new food and the buffet help me do just that. I get to taste a little bit of everything without having to waste food or burn a hole in my wallet. Now I know what I like [: The bf at the time loves their chicken tikka masala, which I agree is absolutely amazing! But I also love their yogurt sauce and the mint chutney. I seem to want to put those 2 sauces all over everything I eat. Oh and I love the basmati rice! Its so different from all the rice I ever tried before but in a good way!

The staff is real friendly and always refill your drinks and make sure you have everything you need all the time. 

If you want Indian food, you should definitely come here! Amazing delicious food and friendly service. Win win!"}
{"text":"We love coming here. They always have the all-you-can-eat buffet up and running at a reasonable price with good food and a pleasant staff. One of my wife's favorite places to go."}
{"text":"Really really liked this restaurant. The selection for lunch was very tasty with just enough heat. My wife and I are very familiar with Indian food as we live in a very Indian place and speak punjabi. We have many Indian friends who cook for us so we do know what authentic is and this is authentic. 

Service was great and the cost was cheap. Can't go wrong with Indian Oven."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch with my family as we were passing through Las Vegas. We thought it would be nice to have the lunch buffet. Once inside, we found the buffet to be steeply priced ($10.95). That would have been okay if the food had been well-prepared and tasty. Unfortunately, the samosas and pakoras were dried out, the dishes were bland and unappetizing. Only the naan was decent, but still I've had much better lunch buffets at Indian restaurants for around $8. A disappointment."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with Rand H. and I found this place to be well decorated great service and the food was, well I said to Rand this place is my new favorite Indian buffet after my first plate (YUMMM). Everything I tried was very good from the tandoori chicken to the many veggy dishes. They even had that mango pudding with fruit cocktail in it that is so good. Another great treat offered is the mango juice that is part of the buffet as well. So if you like good Indian buffets do not miss this one."}
{"text":"I'm in town for a few days and decided to stop by. Plenty of vegan options available. Their staff is attentive to the customer's needs while providing authentic, delicious Indian cuisine at a reasonable price. Definitely stop by if you're in the area. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good ambience. Average food. Ordered dal makhani and paneer Tikka masala. Dal wasn't that great, paneer was average."}
{"text":"Eating here felt so right, yet so wrong. A dinner buffet for only $10? This is unheard of! It included naan, delicious chicken tikki masala, tandoori chicken, rice, chicken curry, plus lamb and vegetarian dishes. I'm not sure if we came on a special night, but they even have a $16 total dinner option too.

The hospitality was amazing, also! Right when we walked in, we were greeted, my water was never empty, and I think it was the owner who explained our options to us, and made sure everything tasted right the entire night. 

I ate entirely too much, and felt guilty for getting it so cheap! I'd say if you want to choose your spice, you may not like the dinner buffet because they are standard medium spices; I liked the amount of spice in the tikki masala (my favorite dish) so it was perfect for me!

Two large kingfishers, plus two dinner buffets was only $34. Woohoo!"}
{"text":"While Indian food isn't our favorite, we do like to try different things so we gave India Oven a try last night. Arrived at opening and the place quickly filled up. We had the buffet which was very good and was the best Indian food I've had. My wife even enjoyed it and she is less a fan of Indian food than I am. We enjoyed our meal and the service was fantastic. Highly recommend if you're looking for a good Indian Restaurant."}
{"text":"First time last night at the Indian Oven after searching high and low for some good Indian that rivals what I get in England when I travel there.  I like this place a lot!  It lacks a lot of the dark tablecloth and somewhat dreary feel you get in many of the places in town.  The restaurant appears clean and the service is exceptional.  We had a steady flow of nan which was cooked perfectly and had great texture.  I got a Taj Mahal beer which was served with a deeply frosted mug.  When ice cold this is an exceptional beer as is the slightly lighter bodied Kingfisher.  

The buffet is great and offers dishes divided between meat-based and vegetarian which is cool if you are not familiar with the dishes.  They had a lamb vindaloo that had great flavor but lacked some of the heat I am used to with vindaloo dishes.  I did hear the table next to me comment on how spicy it was so perhaps this is just my tastes and preference.  

All of the dishes I had were excellent.  The basmati rice was served out of a rice cooker which seemed a little off considering everything else was is long pans.  The lamb was a little dry perhaps because it was slightly over cooked?  All of the chicken dishes were exceptional as we're the veggie.  I also ordered a side of papadum which are great if you have kids.  They did not serve it with the traditional spicy chutney I am used to though but they did nail the green cilantro based sauce.

I few of my pet peeves that this place passed on was perfectly filtered Arizona water.  No chemical or hard water flavors so they must have a good RO system.  The other was that when the bill was delivered they kept filling waters and asked us if they could get us anything until we left which again speaks to their high level of service.  

The wait staff were dressed neatly and groomed to the extent that I wondered how I could get my facial hair so tight.

A great night and experience and I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why is this place so poorly rated. I think it must be the service because the food was good.

The food was certainly tasty. No complaints here. The service though was slow. We visited twice, lunch and dinner. Lunch is buffet style and they took time to refill the items from the buffet which is sad. Nobody wants to sit hungry for 10 to 15 mins at a buffet place and then wait for all items to be slowly refilled.

At dinner which is a la carte, they took time to bring in the standard veg meal thali which was surprising since you expect food for a thali to be ready and prepared already.

However the food was delicious and the staff was friendly.

I may come to this place again but if I am in this strip mall, I may end up visiting the thai restaurant next door. This place surely is expensive. It may be because of the limited choice of Indian restaurants in the area
."}
{"text":"I got in my head that I wanted something different so off to Yelp I went and looked for random types of food and found India Oven. Sounded really good so off we went! Now the food is solid 4 stars. So why 5 stars? The service is that good that it bumps it up. I am not a buffet person at all. I avoid them! But this food was hot and fresh and the buffet area was really clean. They bring fresh naan to the table, the good garlic one, as well as a chicken dish. They keep the drinks full and the dirty plates off your table quickly. They seem geniuinly happy that you are there and enjoying the food. 

Now I am not an expert by any means on Indian food and don't try everything on the buffet but the Naan, masala and curry was all excellent. I also loved their chai and had several glasses which comes with the buffet. All the meats were tender and very flavorful and I cannot wait to go back! This is the best Indian food I have had in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I love ethnic food, the heck with burgers,pizza,chicken, blah,blah. Here we are in the greatest country in the world and we have the most boring  government controlled food choices. We don't have as many choices as other countries, BORING.....
All of our food has to be politically correct or we can't buy it or find it in restaurants!!
That's why I love ethnic food, they can get away with it to a certain degree, not totally though.
I happened upon the Indian Oven the other night with other some other people (Oops, am I politically correct) that enjoy food.
We were seated promptly, received menus and were asked if we were interested in the buffet.  We checked out the buffet and just by looking at the choices I knew it would be great. My daughter was craving for goat ! Can we buy goat in a grocery store ? No!  She likes fiery hot food, takes after me, and ordered the hottest curry ever with rice. I'm enjoying the leftovers right now, huge portion.
The buffet had so many choices, I can't even remember the names and if I did I wouldn't know how to spell them. The food was fantastic, and all of the items were fresh and delicious. The food was being replaced regularly and no one had to scrape the bottom of the barrel.
The service was great and we were asked many times if we needed more food , like the skillet of Tandoori chicken and ground meat sausages along with naan. Not to many american restaurants do that, unless you pay extra!
I can't say enough about this place except for, I'll be back, and I approve this message."}
{"text":"After having gone to India Oven a few times now, I'm updating my review for their buffet to 4 stars. I think it's great that they have it for dinner as well which is fairly uncommon to see for an Indian restaurant. For $12, you can have some good Indian food. The highlights of the buffet are the chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala, and the paneer tikka masala. Other solid options are also the palak saag, samosa, and pakoras. Everything is mildly spicy. The garlic naan that's brought out is always piping hot, soft and fluffy. I go mostly just for that!

Unlike other buffets, their desserts are also pretty good. They have carrot halwa and gulab jamuns which are served hot. Both are good.

I can't give it 5 stars because the service is sometimes on the slow side. I've noticed that when you go in a group, it takes a little bit to get naan and for them to clear plates, get the check, etc."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been talking about finding a good Indian food restaurant and we saw the reviews and decided to try India Oven with our two young kids (3 and 1).  It was delicious! Our 1 year old ate all the fruit and chicken we would put in front of him and my picky daughter didn't eat much, but my husband and I made up for it.  The dinner buffet was about $9.50 and there was a great variety of food plus the garlic naan and chicken they brought out was heavenly.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow!  I stumbled into this place on the way to give blood for those injured in the Vegas shooting knowing that I needed to have food in my system prior to my donation. Am I EVER glad I found this. 
Buffet pretty standard as far as items but THE FLAVORS! Awesome. 

Will become a regular for me for sure. Want to come back for dinner to see what's what with that."}
{"text":"I can't believe how cheap this place is.

Lunch Buffet is $8.95 and Dinner Buffet is $9.95.

The food is very very good.  The service is great, too.  

For the price, I don't think you can get better Indian food."}
{"text":"I had a dinner buffet here this week. It was one of the best Indian buffets I have had in the US. There was an excellent variety of both Veg and Non Veg food including desserts. Food tasted great! Garlic Naan served hot at the table is great. Serving Tandoori chicken on a sizzler plate at the table is a master stroke. The Gulab Jamun was fantastic - hot and fresh. All this for 9.95$. I am going again this weekend."}
{"text":"I was hesitant about eating at the buffet, especially for dinner, because I've seen Indian buffets be average at best at other places. But this buffet was excellent! It had great variety, included pakoras, chaat, and mango lassi, in addition to all the usual staples of multiples types of chicken, rice, subjis, and so on. Garlic naan are apparently standard, not something you have to pay extra for, because they were waiting at my table by the time I came back from the buffet. The service was excellent too. The owner came over a couple times to check on us, and we had multiple servers asking if we wanted more naan or to fill our water. Everything tasted great. Desserts were fantastic too. The gulab jamun was to die for. I would highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I was not disappointed with my second visit to India Oven.  Good service, great quality for a buffet at a very reasonable price.  It is a bargain at $10.95 for an adult dinner buffet that includes mango lassie, dessert and Indian tea.   Meat entrees like lamb vindaloo, tikki masala,  vegetarian dishes, salad and desserts are there for you to choose from.  This buffet is a wonderful way for children or others who are interested in sampling a variety of Indian dishes at one sitting!"}
{"text":"****Updating Sadly****. I've give them for more chances past 8 months. Been here 10 min, no naan. Tiki masala is no longer good chunk chicken at the buffet, it's pellets. Their growth and resulting changes is going to lose their previously loyal customers. 

Amazing Year after Year!!
We have come here for several years and watched them expand five fold. Though they are busier than before everyone discovered them, and we have to wait now at the buffet or for a booth at times, the original management still greets us. 

Quality is still amazing. Flavor is still great. We don't hesitate to ask when water or naan isn't refilled, and despite slight language barrier with a few of the guys, they pleasantly accommodate. 

We will come here for as long as they stay the way they are today! Great place!"}
{"text":"A man sits at his cubicle .  A man listens, and laughs at the latest trends, as vapid chattering of who cheated on whom, what Snooki is doing next, does this dress make me look fat, do you ever eat cantaloupe with mayo ( WTF?!?!).  A man hears one snippet of information that he scoffs at, but files away for future use, at mention of India Oven being the pinnacle of  lunchtime specials.  A man expects a meal as insubstantial as his co-workers conversation.

A man's expectations are defeated.  Multiple times.  A man cannot deny the siren call of India Oven's delicious food.  Words fail to spring to mind for this man, as he stops thinking in words and begins thinking in terms of curry.  A man has tried every item India Oven offers in their buffet over the course of 5 meals, and has yet to be disappointed.  A man assures the reader he/she will become helplessly addicted as well."}
{"text":"Although I have been craving some Indian food for the greater part of the last year, it's taken me this long to get around to getting some. The largest reason is the fact that I have two young kids who are rarely adventurous enough to try things outside of chicken fingers and mac and cheese. Once the Indian bug had struck me one too many times, hubby and I decided to leave it up to yelp on where we could score some sweet buffet action...reason being that the kids could pick and choose what they wanted.

We've passed India Oven numerous times since it's in the neighborhood but this was the first time going in. When we arrived there was one other couple seated. It was a little early for dinner so it's understandable. As soon and they left and it was just us in the restaurant, the attentiveness of the servers was a little too much. I do appreciate the endless basket of naan and the tandoori chicken, thank you, but I don't need to be asked if everything is okay every 5 minutes or so. The staff was super friendly though, so this was only mildly annoying. Once others arrived, the attention shifted to them. Thank you...

The chicken tikka masala was on point...I was very happy with that. This was my first time trying lamb vindaloo, and that was good too. The paneer masala was good but the sauce was thinner than the chicken tikka. I tried some other things, all were decent. The buffet is separated into vegetarian, non-vegetarian, and salad & dessert. The vegetarian options were plentiful and the kids found a couple things they liked.

Price wise is where I knock the two stars off. Although the adult buffet is reasonable at $8.95 for dinner, the kids buffet was $6.95. I knew what it was going into it, but there is no way my five year old eats close to that amount. She had some rice, naan, and some cheese balls...that's about it. Chances are if we come back it will be on a date night."}
{"text":"Can't say the food is terrible because it wasnt. But it definitely did not taste like authentic Indian food. There was no spice at all. The tandoori chicken just tasted like BBQ chicken at best."}
{"text":"For a typical Indian buffet, this one is hard to beat... really good Indian food at a really good price. We came and tried this place after discovering that our usual Indian place was closed on Mondays... and I'm glad that we had that little stumble. 

The service was good - very attentive and accommodating. We have a 2.5 year old and I know wait staff is typically giving us the side eye... so it's always good when they engage and are helpful.

All in all the value is hard to beat... try the Chicken or Paneer Tikka Masala when you go..."}
{"text":"I love love the chicken tikka here! The naan bread is so good too! I eat here once a week and crave it when I can't have it."}
{"text":"This was a last minute decision for lunch and bellies are glad we stopped in. Usually I'm not the fan of buffet food. But the food here was perfectly spiced; they keep it fresh; and the texture was spot on. Oh, let me mention the price. Two for lunch, with all the chicken, lamb, vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, it only cost us $20 - for both of us. 
Service is outstanding and the owner walks by and ask if you're enjoying your food."}
{"text":"Good food for a good price. The waiter was very nice and attentive. The curry chicken was our favorite. The tandoori chicken was also very good, and spicy. The basmati rice was seasoned lightly and complimented the different sauces. The Kheer was also a hit. The Mango Lasse is part of the buffet and is a great palette cleanser between dishes. We had a craving for chicken tikka masala, drove 30 minutes to eat here and ended up favoring the curry chicken here.  This place is very easy to find and worth checking out."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Indian restaurant for over 9 years. I have yet to find better. This restaurant is clean, the food is fantastic, and the staff is friendly and welcoming. Fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great buffet!  The food was excellent.  I loved the Paneer Tikka Masala and the Chicken Tikka Masala.  The Shrimp Biryani was also excellent.  They also bring you Garlic Naan and Tandoori Chicken as well.  The chicken was very good, however I thought the Garlic Naan was over cooked and tasted a little burnt.  We also indulged in dessert.  We tried the Mango Custard, Rice Pudding, and (I think, but I'm not totally sure) the Indian Cheesecake.  The cheesecake was my favorite followed by the mango custard.  The rice pudding was good, but I've never been a fan of it anywhere I've been.  My friend loved the rice pudding though. The staff was very attentive and nice, and the restaurant seemed clean and organized inside.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I have been craving chicken tikki masala and thought of give them a try. I was by myself so wanted to take to go. The smells immediately made me want to stay and savor. They suggested the buffet to go. I'm so glad I did.  My mouth is having a happy party with all the wonderful herbs, spices, and tender meats.  The desserts were tasty as we'll. I spent 12 for plenty of food. They charge by the pound.  Nan provided as well.  I'll go back with a friend and enjoy the smells and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Hungry for good, high quality Indian buffet? Look no further than India Oven. I don't live in Mesa but every time I go to the Valley I have to eat at least one there. Everything is fantastic and the service is great. The value is also amazing for the price. I can't find one thing to complain about, not that I want to. I've been to so many Indian buffets where you can tell right away that the food is second-rate or the selection is limited. Not here - it's an Indian food lovers delight."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and have nothing but good things to say about India Oven. I always drive past it thinking it probably wouldn't be good considering its in Mesa but I was wrong!!! The selection is great and they have plenty of vegetarian and non-vegetarian items to choose from as well as some tasty desserts and appetizers! 

The food isn't too heavy and the servers and staff are very friendly! They have won Trio Advisor awards for the past two years. DH and I love The Dhaba but it's out of the way for us so India Oven is the perfect place to get our fix for delicious Indian food! Also, it's buffet so it's much less costly than The Dhaba."}
{"text":"I adore this place, the service is fantastic!  I love the yummy choices, the food is always fresh, and there is always something new I have never tried. I Love the \"Bread\" they bring around."}
{"text":"Super hungry money worth food. Hot & fresh nan serving as per your request. Good vegetarian buffet options. Too much food to attack . Must try."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the owners are very kind and attentive.  Our favorite Indian restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"Like cockroaches?

Wish I could give zero stars. Saw the reviews and was impressed. We went around 7:30 on a Sunday evening and opted for the buffet. The food was lukewarm but tasted ok (nothing incredibly special). I looked to the right and saw a small cockroach crawling on the wall. Called the waiter over and he picked it up with a napkin. Seemed annoyed with the cockroach but not alarmed. No huge apology. Just a quick sorry and walked away. My boyfriend asked for the check and when the waiter brought it to the table I said, \"are you seriously going to charge us for dinner when there's a cockroach on your wall?\" He muttered no and we left."}
{"text":"Siting off of Gilbert road in a shopping center India Oven is unassuming to the standard passer by but for those who have eaten here you will never be able to avoid the temptation to stop and dine. 

Possibly the most authentic Indian food in the valley with great service and a wide variety of menu options. I myself always order off of the menu as I am familiar with Indian Cuisine but I hear the buffet is quite delicious.

My personal recommendations are the Vegetable Samosas (not spiced), Chicken Tikka Masala (spice by request), Lamb Boti Masala (spice by request), garlic naan (not spiced) and for those who are new to Indian Cuisine you can't go wrong with Tandoori Chicken."}
{"text":"Can I give more than 5 stars?!? If I could, I definitely would. The buffet is always clean and never empty. It has a good selection of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian items. AND all you can drink mango lassi! My favorite is the paneer tikka masala. It's sooo good! Another plus is that the naan is free flowing. They come bring the hot naan right to your table. 

Would definitely suggest!"}
{"text":"We loved this place. It's hard to find a restaurant that sells GOOD food. Most of the time it is just ok or moderate food. This was good, no, great food. The staff was amazing! They paid attention. If we had any questions about the food they were more than happy to tell us. We can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant it's some of the best Indian food that I've ever eaten!! Their customers service is also very impressive I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Bomb!!! Best buffet I have ever had and extremely reasonable. Wish they had one in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Good Prices, Friendly Service, and a good lunch buffet.

I never leave here hungry, they have a good selection of items and vegetarian dishes. 

Stop in and check them out!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, hearing all of the jokes about what Indian food does to your system I was afraid to try it. But a friend pushed and I agreed to go. I absolutely loved it, not everything was my cup of tea and there seemed to be a language barrier between me and the waiter, I wanted a Coke and twice got diet.
The tandoori chicken was very good, I can't remember the names of everything, but they had this mango pudding with pineapple chunks in it that was addictive and the yogart suace that you use to cool down the hot stuff is very memorable."}
{"text":"Tasty food is tasty. Seriously, I'm not a huge fan of Indian food myself, but this place...yummy! Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Super good! Wait staff is fast and friendly. Food tastes great and has plenty of variety."}
{"text":"There were 665 +1 reviews. Im superstitious so I decided to eat here so I could review the place and be the 667th post. Food was awesome"}
{"text":"I am glad I tried India Oven. It's saved my opinion on Indian food (I had it once before at another place and was disappointing). The restaurant was nicely decorated and the service was great! Maybe it was because it was the lunch hour on a Saturday but everyone was so nice and attentive. Servers brought a plate of warm garlic naan as soon as i grabbed the last piece every time!  The food was delicious and considering it was a buffet and I could get as much as I wanted for a great price- the experience was amazing. I plan on revisiting many many more times so that I could try every dish in different variations because the quality and variety is amazing."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place since my experience last night. We have been to this place multiple times over the year especially since they have night buffet and found it pretty good. Last night i went to this place and after eating the main course headed to the desert section and while grabbing a bowl for desert found a live \"COCKROACH\" in the bowl. I immediately showed this bowl with the roach in it to the owner & waitress staff who apologized for the experience and they started examining all the bowls for any such signs. I have had positive experience about this place but this was one incident / experience for which i may think to go to this place again. Your experience may vary."}
{"text":"This place has become a new family favorite. We love that they offer a buffet at dinner. It's a great way to feed a large group of people inexpensively. The gluttons in my family eat themselves into a sickly stupor every single time.

What really makes Indian Oven a great value-- mango lassi, chai, garlic naan, and tandoori chicken are all included with the buffet. Once they brought out seekh kebabs instead, and some of the men in our group nearly shed tears of joy.

Service is excellent. Business has really picked up for them so there are lots of new faces, but they are all trained well. The female owner remarked, \"We haven't seen you in awhile.\" Very nice of her to remember. One of their waiters offered to fix me up a plate with the puffed rice and chutneys that is similar to an Indian snack found on street carts. I've never encountered anything else like that at other Indian restaurants.

Most of the dishes are great although not quite as good as my beloved Royal Taj. But Indian Oven is affordable, delicious and closer to my house so I'll happily keep returning."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat as their buffet is delicious and low cost.  We have gone numerous time on the weekends and will be back!"}
{"text":"I have a couple basic guidelines, when it comes to restaurants. First, any place which actively advertises is probably not very good. If it doesn't sell itself by word of mouth, there's probably a reason. Second, Indian restaurants which offer a dinner buffet aren't very good. I see it as an act of desperation to save a failing business. Still, I figured I'd give India Oven and their dinner buffet a try.

Most things on the buffet were below average. Nothing stood out as particularly good, and a few things were pretty terrible. The worst offender was the rice. It was so hard and crunchy it was inedible. This problem was compounded by the fact that we waited forever for our naan. Naan is thin bread cooked in one of the hottest ovens used for cooking food; it takes less than a minute to cook. Once we got it, though, it was pretty decent. The tandoori chicken was ok, but it had a sour taste to it, like it had been sprayed with lime juice and left to soak it in. The chicken didn't taste super-fresh, either, so it might have been cooked and rewarmed.

As for the service, it mainly consisted of about 10 people milling around the small dining room, refilling water, asking how the meal was, and being confused about what went where. 

I'm still looking for a great Indian place in the valley, but I've had much better food at Royal Taj in Tempe and Star of India in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"The chairs upholstery was filthy and dirty. The samosa was very greasy. The food was awful. Tasted bland and the panner was rubbery. Very disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place to eat and that's saying something because I absolutely hated Indian food before I ate here!!! It is amazingly good and the service is honestly the BEST I've ever had in my life! They refill your glass whenever you start to run out and always bring out extra naan (best freakin bread stuff ever) and you never are left running out of it or waiting for more of anything. I also love how it feels like you're really in India somehow!"}
{"text":"Restaurant closes at 10 and we started with dinner at 9:10. As there was no tandoori chicken and naans available, I asked server for it and he said they closed the kitchen at 9:15. Again at 9:25 server came to our table saying \"we are closing in 5 mins and will be removing all the food, please take whatever you want now\". REALLY??  You are serving bland food and then rush your customers even though the closing time is 10.
I wonder if the 4+ ratings are even genuine. Honestly I would not recommend this place for authentic Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"I have not tried all the Indian places in Phx but among the one I have tried ( like 7) this one is by far the best place .... great food , nice variety , always fresh and tastes awesome , very reasonable price .... will highly recommended for vegetarians as well"}
{"text":"We managed to drive from Florence once every two weeks to come and eat Indian food. The servers Are nice to my kids and they so the naan plain for us. The mango lassi is one of our favorite. Chicken tikka is never a miss. I love the raita sauce so it is not as a spicy. 
The desserts are great choices and we always make sure to have some of them.

We will be coming back also."}
{"text":"Very disappointed at the service we received here last week. Usually we get great service here, but this time there was some guy we hadn't seen before hovering around our table. When I asked him for a special request that normally the staff is happy to fill for my 5 year old, he refused and said all they had was what was out in the buffet. I normally don't do the buffet and order from the menu, but he wasn't interested in taking any orders - he wanted all of us to eat at the buffet (said \"this is a special dinner buffet\" and walked off before I could say anything more). We were so turned off by his rude manner that at that point, I just refused to order. The kids meals were also overpriced; we were charged a full buffet fee for two 5 year olds, who only ate rice, a little naan, and a few cucumbers! We had brought some friends who had never eaten there before and after this experience, agreed we wouldn't return."}
{"text":"This is a good old Las Vegas standby and I've been known to dine here when in a pinch. The pinch is usually that I don't feel like eating anywhere else. If I could review the restaurant scene in Vegas in general, it would not do well, that's for sure.

There is nothing wrong with the service but sometimes they just don't seem to get it right. If there is one thing I don't like in my Indian food, it's when it's over spiced. I specifically remember asking them not to do that and when I took the first bite I realized they did it anyway. Now I'm not one to shy away from spicy but if it's the only thing going on in my mouth then I'm not going to like it.

I had the Aloo Ghobi Masala: Cauliflower and potatoes cooked with onions, tomatoes, and spices. It's too bad they don't tell you what spices and for $12.95 it was remarkably overpriced. In fact, I think this whole place is overpriced. Otherwise, it was very flavorful and I would have given them another star just for that but the spiciness killed it for me.

I'm willing to give them one more chance though. Maybe on the next visit they'll listen to me and give me what I want, not what they think I should have. There really is good Indian food out there where the spice doesn't overwhelm. I just know it."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Indian food, and I was hesitant, but I LOVED IT. I went to the buffet, on the waiter's recommendation, so I got to try a little of everything. Can't wait to go back, craving it now."}
{"text":"Great selection if vegetarian and meat dishes. The dessert was delicious. I was super Impressed because the mango lassi and hot milk tea were included and usually that is separate. I ate so much I was super stuffed! Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic food.  I highly recommend the buffet. Friendly staff. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"\"I don't no what happen..but..the food here was blah! Rice is not included with d main dish..not right. Rip off..don't bother\""}
{"text":"I absolutely love Indian food and this place does NOT disappoint. Authentic, fresh and delicious! They have a great selection of food at the buffet, Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Tikka Masala, Daal, Vegetarian Dishes, Saag Paneer and phenomenal Lassi and Chai tea which are both included with the buffet price.

The service is TOP NOTCH, every other restaurant can learn from these folks how to treat your customers. Very kind, very prompt, always smiling and joking around. Very cool folks I must say, they make you feel very welcomed. 

The decor is excellent as well and with the music you'll feel like you're really in India. All around great experience, 5/5 big stars! LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"This is not indian food. The food had no flavor to it. The saag paneer tasted like slop, the vegetarian dish with the cheese squares in it was not done right, the cheese was way too soft, the mango lassi tasted rotten, the mango custard was horrible. The naan bread was burnt and had no flavor. $13 sounded like a good price for an indian buffet but I didn't get what I paid for. They had mexican servers, I think they had mexican cooks too cause this was not authentic indian food at all. The food was not spicy and had no flavor. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I had my dad's 60th Birthday party catered by Indian Oven, and the experience was very pleasant!  The food was warm, fresh, amazing, and on time!  I have so many leftovers, I am thinking of opening my own restaurant :)

Staff was very personable and she helped narrow down all of the entrees to our liking.  

Very decent prices for dinner buffet!  Constantly refilling naan and tandoori chicken!  Yumm!!!"}
{"text":"I am so addicted to India Oven that it's embarassing. I've been known to come here at least once a week, and occasionally by myself if I can't drag anyone in with me. Eating alone at a buffet is not usually worth the shame, unless it's here.

The staff is incredibly attentive and kind, and the owner is always fast to come over and ask you about your experience. The inside is decorated beautifully and the ambiance is low key yet classy. 

The lunch/dinner buffets have both mango lassi and chai tea, both of which I love. Their buffet is the cheapest I have seen ($7.95/lunch, $9.95/dinner) and also the best. Their Tikka Masala and Spinach Paneer are definitely my favorites, although they have a few rotating dishes that are also amazing. Lots of variety, always hot, and wonderful flavor. 

Closed on Mondays, but otherwise, go give them a visit."}
{"text":"Overall review for the lunch buffet: mediocre but reasonably priced ($10-11).

The buffet has a decent selection of rotating Indian dishes, but they are all surprisingly spice-less.  The Tandoori chicken was a little dry with a surprising lack of flavor; the curry goat and curry chicken -- muted flavor and spice-less; the palak paneer (spinach with cheese) -- nicely creamy, but a little too buttery and spice-less; the samosas -- deliciously crispy, but (you guessed it) spice-less; the chana masala (chick peas in masala sauce) was probably the highlight of the buffet, but also spice-less.  

On a positive note, they do offer free naan with the buffet.  And naan does make everything better.  That said, if the location wasn't so convenient to downtown and the northern end of the strip, I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Last night, my boyfriend asked me if we could eat curry for dinner.

\"I walked into the closet and it smelled like Indian food for some reason. And now I'm craving curry. Can you go find an Indian buffet on Yelp and we can go there after you get your manicure?\" - Boyfriend, probably.

The hunt was on! It actually took me a good few minutes to find an Indian buffet that was open for DINNER, as opposed to only at lunch. Luckily, India Oven was around to save the day and appease our cravings.

The dinner price was $14 per person. They have tons of parking, and even though we arrived at peak dinner time (7:30 PM on a Monday) it wasn't packed. They also have a big hall that you can reserve for parties, but that was empty when I came in.

The service was great and the waiters picked up our plates really quickly. They made sure to ask us if we were OK or needed anything every so often.

Now, for the good part - the buffet selection:

VEGETARIAN CURRIES:
- Paneer tikka masala
- 2-3 more vegetarian curry options

MEAT CURRIES:
- Chicken tikka masala
- Lamb vindaloo
- 1 more meat curry that I forgot the name of
- Grilled chicken dish that I always see at Indian buffets (not a curry)

NON-CURRY:
- Salad bar
- Assorted yogurt dressings
- Those crunchy bean-shaped wafer things
- Circle wafer thing
- Tamarind chutney
- Mint chutney
- Some fried pancake-looking thing, I forgot the name (it was thick, like a veggie burger)
- Basmati rice, plain
- Basmati rice, fried

DESSERT:
- Kheer
- Gulab jamun
- Mango pudding
- Carrot halwa

DRINKS:
- Chai
- Mango lassi (the unlimited mango lassi made this review five stars hands down. I have been to MANY Indian buffets and I've never seen a place that serves you unlimited mango lassi)

THINGS TO NOTE:
- Garlic naan is made fresh, and they give your table a basket; it's part of the buffet price, but comes directly from the kitchen. You don't have to order it.. they just brought it out to us 10-12 minutes after we were seated.
- I did NOT see any samosas or pakora, at all.

I really enjoyed this place, despite not having any samosas. The unlimited mango lassi and variety in desserts really made me happy. I usually only eat malai kofta curry with rice and tamarind chutney, but instead of malai kofta, they had paneer tikka masala, which was perfectly fine!

I'm also really impressed that they served us fresh garlic naan. There's a lot of vegetarian curry options too.

This is officially my go-to Indian buffet place!"}
{"text":"Unlimited naan and as much tikka masala as you want! Plus mango lassi is included in the buffet and it's frikin good. Staff is super friendly and always helpful."}
{"text":"We had the dinner buffet. The fried appetizers were bland and dry. But the rest was good. The bottomless mango lassi was a highlight as was the chicken. Service was prompt and professional. I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"It's close to my work so have been there a couple of times. I believe their buffet is mediocre. A standard menu...nothing there is extraordinary. And expensive for the buffet variety they offer. OK to have it if you are feeling like Indian food. I prefer guru palace over this spot."}
{"text":"So dang good. Waiters hover a little excessively but they keep your drinks full and are very nice. The food is amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and i are biiig foodies ..Pakistani and indian food is no 'new' for us..this place is average..
living in SF, i used to get a dish for $7.95 /that would feed two ppl/ with the most amazing taste ..and this place is..BLAH .unless u have good company that would take your mind off of that food..is not worth your money or time..
If you are new to the amazing flavors of pakistan or india..then it is ok to try..otherwise..BLAH.."}
{"text":"This place does no wrong in my eyes.  On a sliding scale of quality versus value, it hits the mark right on target.  Whether it be the lunch or dinner buffet, India Oven has NEVER disappointed.  It appears to be family owned and operated and I have always felt very welcome and comfortable here.  They are very attentive and aim to please.  The naan... it comes with the perfect amount garlic and seasoning and is absolutely scrumptious!  The Tandoori chicken they bring to the table is also not to be missed!  The balance of veg and non veg offerings is also perfect, and the Mango Lassi makes a perfect sipping dessert.  This has become my go to when I crave Indian, and since discovering this place, I can't recall the last time I was at Copper Kettle.  The lunch buffet is $8.95, dinner $10.95."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! I loved the fried cauliflower appetizer. The naan was perfectly cooked.And the boiled  coffee was perfection. I've never had such a delicious cup of coffee. The only thing i was a little disappointed with was the meat variety platter we ordered came on a skillet that was too hot and burned the bed of veggies and a little of the meat. But everything was so delicious, the place was spacious, nicely decorated & clean.& the staff was super pleasant. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Thie best Indian buffet in arizona. Both for lunch and dinner. Saturday is the best day for selection. Lamb. Vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, chili chicken, chicken manchurian, saag, chana, paneer, kadhi pakora, samosa, pani poori, garlic naan, and tandoori chicken and more. Staff is very cool too"}
{"text":"India Oven is legitimately one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. The food is always great and I keep coming back. 

To say an example of them being awesome, recently I was an idiot and ordered the a large quantity of the wrong thing to-go. When I got home I called and they exchanged all of the food for me for free (the items I wanted were more expensive). They even threw in some rice. 

I wish evert resturant was like India Oven. They have made a raving fan out of me."}
{"text":"Service was a little drab but the world cup game was on, so who can blame em'? I would have liked to see a larger selection but I suppose here you get 'quality' over 'quantity'. 

Besides that, India Oven is a great Indian buffet and a 'one-of-a-kind' place around the east valley of Phoenix. Nearly all of the food was delicious and it has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm no Indian food expert but I thought this place was pretty good. Enough meat and vegetarian variety to sample different flavors. Naan is brought out fresh to your table, but they were kind of slow with that and it was inconvenient to wait. Lunch buffet price was great and you can definitely walk away full."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Indian food. I learned my husband is, so I took one for the team and we are here for dinner. So, you can either do the buffet or order from the menu. We opted in for the buffet. The chicken was actually really flavorful and the rice was bomb. That garlic naan that they bring out, was seriously my fave. My husband would go back here. I wouldn't but that's because Indian food isn't my thang. I think it's worth a try and then if you are loving Indian food, then it might be a regular for you."}
{"text":"Living in the West Valley, I've been missing my Indian Food fix.  Finally moving to Gilbert, I now am near a few good Indian restaurants with buffets.  Of those I've tried, Indian Oven is one that I really like the most.  I have only gone to the lunch buffet.  The price is great for all you can eat of this delicious food.  I like the unlimited Mango Lassi and the hot garlicky Naan brought around as much as you like.  

There is a good selection of the vegetarian and non-veg dishes.  I find the veg ones most tasty and interesting. One I really liked for texture and taste is Kadhi Pakora, which are fried veg pakoras (kinda crunchy) in a yellow curry.  Yummm!  They also have different saag dishes, chopped spicy salad.  The condiments taste homemade, unlike some other places.  They have fresh fried potato slices covered in a batter...very flavorful.  That apparently was popular because it wasn't there the whole time.

Also a nice choice of 4 different types of warm and cold desserts.  

The staff is very pleasant and took my plates and refilled my water as needed.  

I found everything quite flavorful....one reviewer complained it was not spicy, but I like Indian food for the flavors, not needing hot spice.  

Only one issue for me...the lunch buffet is only open till about 2, which isn't always convenient for me.  Some other places are open later.

There are a couple of TVs, but they were on mute while I was there so didn't bother me, and also weren't in my line of vision.

Great place to eat, I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Great food, great price, great service. I went here with my husband & our 3 small children (5, 3 & 1) they were very attentive to not only us adults but also our children."}
{"text":"Rare to find a buffet at dinner and not just lunch. Huge and weird (good weird) inside. 
1/2 buffet is veg which was great. About 5 dessert items too. 
All good food! 
Chai tea and that sweet orange drink too
Clean place, nice enough wait staff. 
Loved the Indian music and Bollywood videos on the tv!! 
Will go again. $13 and we'll worth it."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and chose the buffet.  The food was great, the staff was very courteous, and the meal was reasonably priced.  This was the first time my daughter had Indian food, and she loved it.  I can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Stopped by today, and took some food home from the buffet, at $5.50 per pound.
Veggie pankoras, tandoori chicken, chicken marsala, biryani, a lamb dish, and some garlic naan.
First thing I thought after I tried some was that I've been missing out! All tasted excellent, and very inexpensive considering the portion."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Fantastic service, never met an employee that I dont like and I VISIT FREQUENTLY. I also like that they keep their buffet going from open to close!"}
{"text":"I come here for the buffet and it is always on point. The service is great and they never leave you needing anything. The price is about $10 per person which is not a bad deal. The mango lassi comes with the buffet so I usually drink some of that and water. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Indian or to anyone who wants to try it for the first time."}
{"text":"I went here the other day with my sister. All of the food on the buffet was delicious and fresh. My favorite was probably the chicken masala. 
The service is some of the best I've ever seen. The servers were always nearby, offering fresh garlic nan or to fill your water before it even gets empty. I even noticed one waiter constantly cleaning the buffet tables, including the wall. The manager even checked on us twice, while we were eating and after we paid our bill, to see how we liked our food. 
If you've never had the chance to try Indian food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Yes, okay, so the waiters don't smile.  That seems par for the course at every Indian restaurant I've been to, no big deal.  They were out of the mushroom matar, but the Palak Paneer was so tasty that I didn't mind.  

We were there with one friend who hadn't had a chance to try a lot of Indian food, so my friend and host ordered an appetizer sampler, three types of naan, and we shared.  It was a fantastic experience, everything was yummy."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for over 15 years. While the location is a bit out of the way, hands down the food is the best Indian food in Las Vegas by a mile. The owner Jitu is an amazing chef. The chicken dishes are amazing. Value for money is excellent."}
{"text":"I drove 3 hours to get here...  and it was totally worth my time and gas!

As we walked in, we were greeted and promptly seated.  I noticed how nice and clean the interior was.  Then we hit the buffet...  all you can drink chai and mango lassi?  YES!  Warm basket of naan at the table?  YES!  Pudding desserts?  YES!  Vegetarian selections?  YES!  Various chicken and lamb curries?  YES! YES! YES!  (That's what she said).  Everything was tasty including the rice!  Some of the best Indian food I've ever had.  Can't beat the price for $9/person for lunch."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in AZ! Chicken Tika and Lamb Vindaloo are my personal favorites. My wife can not drink enough of the Chai tea. Wonderful assortment of options and even a vegetarian area. 

If you live in the east Valley this is the only place for an authentic taste of India!"}
{"text":"We always avoid the Buffet as it's  a mild level of spice.

My wife and I have been looking for a replacement Indian Restaurant. After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor & Yelp, we had to try the Indian Oven. Upon entering the India Oven, we were not greeted with the traditional smell of Indian spices. The smell was really very mild-maybe the location of this restaurant demands a very mild aroma? Many of our friends just will not even try an Indian Restaurant due to their thinking of heavy use of spices. Also there were no diners of Indian Culture at the India Oven when we were there-a true negative sign.  My wife and  I are at the medium level of spice.

We ordered: Papadum, Garlic Nan, Vegetable Biryani, Karahi Prawns, Chicken Tikka Masala with medium levels of spice  & 2 Kingfish Beers-cost was $48 + Tip-reasonable if it was better.

The Papadum and Garlic Nan arrived first. The Garlic Nan was really mild as it needed more garlic. The Chicken Tikka Masala also lack full flavor as we felt the medium level of spice was really well below mild at this restaurant. When the Karahi Prawns were served, it was so similar to Mexican Shrimp Fajitas that we didn't know what to think. The Indian medium level of spice was flat at best at the India Oven. The vegetable Biryani was one of the best rice dishes we've had. The Kingfish beers were served in frozen glasses-the best way to enjoy any brand of beer!

The India Oven was very clean with no issues noted. Table service was very good. I did discuss the level of spice with our server. He advised that we ordered a level of 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. I guess that scale might be acceptable for Mesa, AZ. A level of 5 should have been medium but it tasted like a 1. A spice level of 1 is usually used on the Buffets, so we always avoid them. That plan failed this time!  Our search for a replacement Indian Restaurant will continue."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable and very cheap!  Good food, atmosphere, etc."}
{"text":"Go to Indian place. Food is always great and we love that theres a vegetarian option for my sister. Staff is very attentive and always nice. Just be careful not to load up too much because they charge for waste."}
{"text":"I've been here four times for the dinner buffet $10 per person. Their food are always delicious and  hot. Their services are great too they will take care of you. I definitely will return again and again."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate the buffet.  EVERYthing was over spiced with a mushy texture.  An expensive disappointment.  I cannot recommend this establishment to anyone and I am astounded it is so highly rated on Yelp."}
{"text":"Yummmmm! This was some goooood Indian food, and it is so hard to find decent Indian food bit this place gets it right! You can smell the spices as soon as you walk through the door. Definitely a place to give a try and their pricing is not bad at all. The naan is unbelievable and if you go during their buffet time, they give you never ending naan!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes. This place is everything yummy that everyone has said it was! Have to admit. I was skeptical. Buffets generally fall short with food sitting too long in warming tables, lots of grease, etc etc. that isn't the deal,here! Nothing stays in the warmers long enough to get  over - done. They are quick to replace items when needed and everything was really delicious. The service is awesome. You really get the feeling that the family that runs the place is inviting you into their home, and they want you to enjoy what they have made for you. The lamb dish melted in my mouth, chicken was moist and yummy and the rice pudding has just enough sweetness. We have found a new favorite place. And if you can eat this well, anywhere else for $9.95, and eat so much with good variety...I just want to know WHERE? Delish!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Both the included mango lassi and hot tea are great. They had a reasonably spicy lamb vindaloo. I usually am not a big dessert person, but the four desserts they had tasted better than when I have had them at other restaurants. The one criticism (or perhaps idiosyncrasy) is that the servers were a bit aggressive about clearing away our plates."}
{"text":"This is my go to Indian restaurant when I have the cravesz best goolab, nice and soft. The tika masala is awesome. My drink was always full and servers are always looking around to assist and refill. Amazing place"}
{"text":"This review is overdue, I've been going here for the past 4 years and the food has never disappointed. Fairly authentic. The service the owners and waiters give are great. As long as you don't mind buffet style food style, it's a grade A place. The price is fair since it's as much as you can eat and like other indian places the naan is freshly made. Just be sure you aren't working on your diet - the food is heavy but delicious! Oh and the bollywood movies they place is a cherry on top *thumbs up*"}
{"text":"Excellent place, went here twice in a week. That's when I learned I could eat Indian every day, no problem!

Buffet is very reasonably priced, all dishes are good, some are very good. Some indian dishes I've never heard of, such as carrot pudding or egg curry. Fantastic to try new stuff. None of it is super-spicy, they really could add a little more kick to some of the items.

Downside is I apparently cannot back away from the food soon enough. I over-ate so much, it was ridiculous. Both times, I knew the second time there was a problem here, and I hit that buffet like a whale scooping krill. 

tl;dr I'm an idiot with poor self-control, but this place will hook you up."}
{"text":"I have loved Indian food my entire life and I always thought the food I was eating was great.. Until one day I was in Arizona and went to India Oven.. Their food is so amazing nothing else compares! They have by far the best buffet I have ever seen. My favorite dish is the paneer tikka masala. I would recommend every single thing in the buffet though. If I could give this place more stars I would! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The lunch buffet is a must do if you're anywhere in a 20-mile radius!  For about $12, you can sample some of the most unusual yet complimentary flavors you've ever experienced.  The service is excellent, the atmosphere is quiet (but not stuffy), and there's a real probability that you will leave uncomfortably full and totally satisfied.  I've never had to wait for a table, and if I'm in a rush, it is easy to get in & out in 20 minutes or less.  Some people might be tempted to grab a quick meal in the McDonald's at the leading edge of the parking lot, but those people probably couldn't appreciate the quality of this place anyway. :) 

If you're in town and love new things, you have GOT to give this place a try!  You'll soon be a regular, too!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such good reviews. There is a dirty cloth wrapped around the entrance door. Food was not pleasing at all. I pushed many things aside on my plate. Lentils had a taste of dish soap. The cups for the mango lessee smelt of dirty towels. Mixed vegetable dish was so overly seasoned with turmeric. Pakora curry tasted sour and rotten. Mango pudding was grainy. Rice pudding was hard and sour I had to spit it out. Indian buffets are my go to... And this place was just gross. Not to mention the staff is not warm or welcoming at all. Will not return."}
{"text":"I do not recommend eating here. First off, the high end ambiance and decor on the website does not match the dank, dark and run down look when you walk in. Secondly, The buffet is limited in choices compared to most that I've been to that serve Indian cuisine. Thirdly, the food is mediocre at best and I lived in India for 6 months. So I know what palaak paneer, etc is supposed to taste like. This stuff tastes like it came out of a package; it had a vinegar taste like pre packaged food. Finally, it is a rip off. I called ahead to ask about getting the buffet to go. They said yes, no problem. I get there and the price went up $3. They tried to charge me more than what's published on the website and extra for the mango lasse which is supposed to be included in the $8.95 price! Do not eat here. There is a better buffet call Kabob and Curry that just opened up off McQueen and Warner. Their lunch buffet is only $5.95 and the food tastes the way real authentic Indian food is supposed to taste!"}
{"text":"Yummy tikka masala! it was my fav dish offered. the buffet had a ton of delicious items. the service was also really great! I would go back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"I'm always a little heartbroken when I talk to people who say they don't like a specific ingredient or type of food because they hated it when they were a kid.  I don't doubt that was the case when you were younger, but have you tried again now that your taste buds have matured a little?  Far too often even my closest friends and family will never try certain cuisines for the rest of their lives because of a bad childhood food experience.  I'll freely admit that I've been that sourpuss from time to time, swearing off certain foods because I didn't like the flavor or the texture from way back when.  But now in my mid 30s, I've been working to follow my own advice and re-examine some of my food phobias.  For example, I despised avocados as a kid.  As an adult, I can't get enough of them.  As an adolescent, I wanted nothing to do with Vietnamese food.  Now, I'm discovering great new Vietnamese tastes all the time.  Today I decided it was time to conquer (or rather re-conquer) Indian cuisine from the depths of food prejudice.  I've had decent Indian food and God awful Indian food, but never great Indian food.  That is, until today.

India Oven lies about a half mile north of the US 60 freeway on Gilbert Rd.  You'll find it on the right side of street halfway between Hampton and Southern Avenues.  I came around opening during lunch for my first go around.  Here you have the option for a la carte dining or jumping head first into their buffet.  I'm a guy with a healthy appetite, but buffets can be deadly for me (I always want to try it all).  But despite that, the lunch buffet is ridiculously cheap at just $10 for all you can eat and drink.  So the decision was super easy.  I counted at least two dozen different food items to choose from in all.  Plate in hand, time to grab as much as I could handle.

I won't bother describing all the buffet items, but amongst the foods available were tandoori chicken, chicken tikka, chicken pakora,  lamb curry, lamb vindaloo, saag goat, as well as vegetarian dishes like gulab jamon, paneer tikka masala, korma, and baal maharani.  And of course some tender piping hot basmati rice to help soak up all those sauces.  For a beverage you can drink as much of their house made Mango Lassi as you want (and I did).  And if you have any questions as to what its in any of the items I just mentioned, there is a person staffing the buffet at all times to answer any questions you have.  And to top it all off, free garlic naan bread was brought to my table by India Oven owner Sarabjit Khurana himself.  

In the end it took two fully stuffed plates for me to get decent samples of all the buffet items.  One thing I really appreciate about their buffet is that all of the items are served with the perfect level of spice.  Not too spicy, but just enough to impart flavor in way that's pleasing to the tongue.  I really don't have anything negative to say about any of the dishes I had as each was freshly prepared, the meat dishes all had generous amounts of meat in them, and even the vegetarian dishes were coupled with sauces that paired perfectly both in terms of taste and aromatics.  If I had to pick my favorites of the bunch, I would say the korma (a vegetable medley covered in a spiced cream), the paneer tikka masala (tofu, cheese, and tomatoes and moderately spicy sauce), and the lamb curry (marinated lamb cooked with various herbs and spices) were my top 3.  I could've had a gallon of that mango lassi (a mixture of mango fruit and yogurt in shake form).  The Naan bread was also delicious, as was the gulab jamon dessert (basically deep fried balls of milk and cheese covered in syrup).

It's not often that I can say a buffet has blown me away in terms of the quality of their food (outside of the Bellagio in Vegas), but India Oven's is just such a buffet.  The staff were incredibly helpful and gracious throughout my meal.  I was absolutely stuffed to the gils in the best possible way.  And all for just $10.  For that price, the quality of their buffet is far higher than it needs to be.  But for people who (like me) have had a past hatred or indifference to Indian cuisine, take a trip to Mister Khurana's place in Mesa.  There's so much good food to choose from here, it'll basically be impossible for you not to fall in love with Indian food again."}
{"text":"This place is so DELICIOUS! There is an all you can eat buffet which is cheap and so good! EVERYTHING that I tried was so delicious!! There is a vegetarian, non-vegetarian, and salad and dessert area. The tikka masala had just the right amount of spiciness and the sauce was so savory and went perfect with the garlic naan bread. The vegetarian \"purees\" were so delectable! I loved all of them! I also loved that the restaurant was decorated appropriately to the origin of the food. To make a long story short, I adored this restaurant and will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian Food for a reasonable price and the service is excellent. I live in North Phoenix but this place is certainly is worth the trip."}
{"text":"We have been here many many times, and it's great every time.  If you order off the dinner menu you won't be disappointed.  If you get the dinner or lunch buffet you'll be in paradise.  The only problem I ever have is leaving painfully full.

It simply can't be overstated.  Everything here is soooo good.  India Oven has some of the best service I've ever received at a restaurant (every time).  Don't be intimidated if you are unfamiliar with Indian food, the staff are great about helping newbies and answering questions.  Prices are reasonable enough to go often rather than just for special occasions...so give this place a try."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last weekend. We had been once before many years ago and liked it quite a bit, but never got around to coming back. We happened to be in the neighborhood and decided to give it another try. 

As we were entering, the Mayor was exiting. He shook our hands, and I asked him how his meal was. He said it's always excellent, so I'm guessing he's a regular. 

The main thing I remember from our previous visit to India Oven is how good the naan was. The naan was pretty good this time, but not quite as good as I remembered it. It was large and looked like elephant ears. It was a little burnt on the bottom. However, I liked that better than the naan I've recently had at other places which has tended to be underdone. 

For our entrees we got the lamb korma and paneer tikka masala. I liked the lamb korma quite a bit. It had large pieces of tender lamb and a tasty sauce. The paneer tika masala was good but not particularly memorable. 

My wife had the mango lassi. She said it was good, and she's pretty picky about her mango lassi. 

At the beginning of our meal, they gave us papadum with mint and tamarind chutneys. The papadum was good but nothing special. I wasn't crazy about the mint chutney. It was okay, but I've had much better. I'm not a fan of tamarind chutney in general, so I'm not going to comment on that. 

We also asked for an order of the assorted pickles which they served with the papadum and gave it to us free. It was interesting but super salty. It reminded me of Mexican salted prunes. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'd try it again. 

We split some raita which was pretty decent. 

Overall, I enjoyed the meal, but I probably won't be back for awhile as there are other Indian restaurants in town that I prefer."}
{"text":"This is a real 5 star place! Best Indian food I've had since moving back from Dallas (which has a tone of great Indian restaurants). The nam bread was fresh, hot and with garlic! The buffet hit all the right notes and there was a broader than usual dessert selection. It's a bit of a drive for me, but this won't be the last time I go by any means! Very friendly and attentive staff too."}
{"text":"The food here is OK I used to like it a lot I like to use that their buffet and eats the chicken tikka masala however chicken tikka masala supposed to be used with a white meat but here they use brown meat that I don't understand their food in the buffet is good I would definitely come here and again and again and again. The service friendliness any amenities here are great I tell my friends to come here highly recommend for stars for the misrepresentation of the brown meat"}
{"text":"great food and prices especially for their buffet! good variety of items to choose from and servers are always friendly and very attentive! recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Best vegetarian Indian Food I have found in  AZ. Very fresh, amazing flavors. The staff is one of the friendliest I have ever come across anywhere. I am a fan and a new regular."}
{"text":"Not bad for Arizona Indian Food. Wish they had more variety at the buffet but for the most part the flavors were good and they had the more popular dishes. Service was great. Very attentive wait staff and friendly servers etc"}
{"text":"We used to love this place until we went yesterday for the lunch buffet. I got my usual place of chicken tikka masala and rice. As I was eating the chicken I noticed the sauce was not the normal sauce. It was different and did not taste as good as it normally was. I bit into the chicken and it tasted foul. I normally crave to eat here but after our last lunch there all the dishes tasted differently than what we loved before. Not sure if they changed recipes or cooks. Either way. Not going back ever again."}
{"text":"Me, my former roommates, my wife and some other friends all love this place. You can eat great flavor like a horse. The only downside is that it is closed part of the day to regroup in between lunch and dinner so if you are craving it in between those times then you have to wait till they re open. Usually like an hour or so. The people are awesome though and it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Simple yet delicious. Buffet style means you can go up over and over again until you are full. Simple sweet dessert. Attentive staff."}
{"text":"Outstanding! I was a bit wary of a dinner buffet but have no fear! Great food, enough variety, some spicy, some not. Appetizers (Samosas, Pakoras AND Onion Bhajis) were fresh and crispy. They bring steaming hot garlic naan (extra garlic yum) and tandoori chicken to your table, and I washed it all down with a tasty Kingfisher beer. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for years. I love the chicken tiki masala. The naan is fresh and delicious. For a treat I will have the mango lassey. The buffet is good, but it lacks variety. I prefer to eat here at night."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Such an easy go-to for a sudden Indian food craving.  They always have their buffet (lunch and dinner) but also regular menu if you want. I've only ever had the buffet because it's such a good deal.  Used to be $10 but they raised price to $11.99 which is still great.  There's never a wait but always decently busy.  The buffet is half meat onslaught and half vegetarian so it's the perfect mix.  There's chicken and lamb options in different sauces (curry, tikka masala, others I can't name) and also biryani and that red roasted chicken. There have been some visits where the sauces are less flavorful than other days.  The paneer tikka masala and saag are my favorite vegetarian options and great for my toddler although everything is at least mildly spicy. Their basmati rice and fresh garlic naan are delicious compliments to the saucy dishes.  There's also a few desserts that my taste buds have not yet acquired the liking for.  The staff is very nice and particularly loves little kids.  They like to socialize with them every time. It's cute."}
{"text":"We've been to this place three times. The food and service is wonderful! It's awesome that mango lassi is included!!! I only wish they had a larger selection on the buffet and that naan would come out more quickly."}
{"text":"My family and I went there two months ago while on a vacation trip in Phoenix.  The food was very good, but the staff was not too friendly.  I suppose if I lived in the area I would probably go back."}
{"text":"Everytime we visit Arizona we go here! They ALWAYS remember us too. The Chicken Tikka Masala is one of my favorites ANYWHERE! LOVE!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner buffet and it was outstanding! For less than $12, you can choose lamb, chicken, vegetarian, desserts and more! So many options, I tried most of them and all of them were great. I could not decide which one to get for seconds.
Staff was professional and attentive. Definitely my favorite Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"As full disclosure, I'm not a buffet fan. The waiter and reviews all recommended it so we decided to try it. The buffet was good but nothing outstanding. Service was again good, but nothing remarkable. Would we come back? Maybe..."}
{"text":"the food is so good my 10 and 11 year old children actually crave and request their Weekend Buffet on a weekly basis the service is always friendly and the mango lassi Is Awesome on top of the fact that they don't charge you for it like every other Indian restaurant those I really do suggest a buffet as you get to try a little bit of everything in your not locked in the one dish"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but the options were somewhat limited. I think the mango and pineapple pudding and rice pudding were my favorite part of the meal, but I didn't have anything that I didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"First time here and we love it. The greeters were super kind to my wife and I and our kids. The buffet is worth the 11.95. They put fresh naan bread on the table. The food was outstanding, the service was great and the experience even with a toddler running around was great. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. And I've only been to Mesa twice. That's how good. 

This is Indian food as it was meant to be served: buffet style for dinner. And on the cheap. Seriously--you're out the door for like 10 bucks plus tip, and in return you get to fill your belly with all the tikka masala, goat curry, mango lassi, saag, and all other kinds of goodness that your heart desires.

The atmosphere isn't super fancy, but when you're rocking a buffet, you don't really expect fine linens, right? The service is snappy, and they're good at clearing your plates quickly. They'll also bring you the tandoor chicken and naan your heart desires."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times as well as gotten them to cater two events with about 80 and 60 attendees. Each time I was completely satisfied. Authentic Indian taste each time. Not overly cooked or colored, just perfect. I love their Paneer/Chicken Tikka Masala. You wont go wrong with them."}
{"text":"I sent a picture to my friend in India and he said the food looked normal but I was eating with a fork instead of bread - so I was wrong. There are reviews that say the food is not spicy as it should be and I would agree but that does not make the food bad. The food is amazing. The price is set to match and they have attentive great service. I eat hear alot and will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"two of us had their buffet for $10 each. Not bad, not  a lot for selection goes but the food was very good. Will eat there again."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my bf's colleague. So glad we took his advice and tried this place. We ordered take out and ate everything at home and it was really delicious. We even had the left overs the next day!
I am not sure about in-dining service but the cashier woman was very friendly. While waiting for our food we saw a group of Indians enter the restaurant with excitement. So you know this place must be legit."}
{"text":"This place is SO good. Fantastic naan, samosas, and buffet. The service was excellent too. We got an order of chicken tikka masala to go and the owner gave us a free order of naan to go with it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place had by far the most food selection for weekday lunch buffett i have ever seen in the U.S.
I am an indian so i know indian food,trust me they do a bang up job.I liked the fact that they had 2 Lamb Entrees and 2 chicken entrees.
Free lassi and Tea for buffett is amazing.
I will be going there again and again for sure."}
{"text":"Looking for cheap Indian food come here... Looking for good Indian food go somewhere else.  Good service but poor food.  One star for the excellent rice pudding.   Garlic nan was burnt so bad you couldn't tell it was garlic nan...  Don't like charcoal posing as food!  Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Where the hell are the amazing Indian restaurants in Phoenix? In North Scottsdale and Chandler there is Indian Paradise, Tempe has Kohi Noor and Dhaba and now Mesa has India Oven! No love for Central Phoenix...

But I digress. India Oven is one hell of an Indian restaurant. Their buffet is very very diversified and I had to have a sample of nearly everything because it all looked too amazing to pass up! I mean, they had Lamb Curry in the buffet....LAMB CURRY! To me, that's a hook, line and sinker. But, just when I thought I found what I was going to get seconds of, I came across the Chicken Marsala. To quote a famous mouse, \"Oh, me! Oh, my!\" It was really incredible! It's definitely something that needs opinions by all you Yelpers salivating while reading this. One last thing about the buffet is that it changes and expands depending on what's fresh and what time of day you drop by. I've even heard that they serve Lamb Vindaloo on occasion (again, this is in the buffet).

Plain and simple, if I lived in Mesa, close enough to India Oven to be a frequent customer, I would be sporting plenty of extra happy pounds. But for now, I'll just use the distance as an excuse to gorge myself and not feel as guilty about it. Please do me a favor if you're reading this and try this place already."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the food was AMAZING! I thought I was never going to find another Indian restaurant like my home state, California. The food had a lot of flavor, the seasoning in their sauces was delicious as well. Customer service was great too. Very friendly and would ask if we were doing ok. Whenever they saw my water cup half empty they would ask if I wanted more. I will definitely be coming back this exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"India Oven has a fantastic buffet.  There is a vegetarian section, a non-vegetarian section, a dessert section and a drink section.  The food is very delicious and you will likely overeat when you come here.  But you will walk away full and satisfied and thinking about when you can come back.  I particularly liked the saag.

One small piece of advice to the owners . . . don't take our plates away while there is still food on them.  This happened several times during a one-hour meal.  We really felt that you were rushing us out.  Not cool."}
{"text":"Really yummy. I don't really know what I ate. But I really likes the stuffs with The yellow sauce. :)

Ever since I first had Indian tea, I fell in love. It's amazing. This place makes it very well and it in the buffet so all you can drink. ;)
Back tithe food, every thing tasted great. There bread is fresh and warm. Can't beat that. 
If you like Indian food or want to try it out, this is definitely a must go place for your taste buds."}
{"text":"This place was a little scary, and I must have really been craving indian food, since I ended up eating here..  To start things off there was no one there on a Friday night at 7pm.  Pink lights set the mood for an interesting meal, as I really couldn't see the food that I was eating.  The combo includes Naan, a drink, and an entree.  I had the chicken vindaloo,and the garlic Naan.  The Naan was decent, but the vindaloo left a lot to be desired.  I could have made a better vindaloo on my own.  There was one small potato and no pearl onions in the dish.  The service was non existent;  the decor was hilarious with the pink lights and the deer head hanging on the wall in the dinning room.  I think that the owner must have been on some really strong drugs when he was decorating this place.  I will definitely not be returning to this restaurant, and my quest for excellent indian food in Vegas will continue. ."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years now, but for some reason or other have not written a review. The food and selection here is great, including paneer and lamb vindaloo. A few of their dishes are also gluten free/vegetarian. THEY HAVE MANGO LASSI ON TAP!"}
{"text":"Service was odd.  We would get refills of water instantly but it took asking 3 people to get more naan bread.

The buffet is organized very well.  I like that the vegetarian options are separate from the meat options.  The mango lassi is a bit more sour than others that I have tried.  The food is a tad spicy for myself and my children.  It makes more sense to order off the menu so we can request a more mild meal than to go with the buffet.

Overall we thought our experience and meal was okay but likely won't return."}
{"text":"Very good food. I never thought a buffet could be this good, but it was. And the advantages of a buffet is that you can try many things. In this case, every item I tried was extremely good."}
{"text":"Consistently good. Clearly labeled food. The staff is very, very attentive, but not over-bearing. My only problem is that I eat so much, and then I get tired."}
{"text":"Pros: food is delicious, large portions, cheap, good service

Cons: not the cleanest place (gum under table and booths have not been pulled out to be cleaned behind for a very long time), bad area (the people behind us did the buffet and paid for two people when 3 were eating, and then kept insisting only two people were eating; extremely ghetto and sad... They paid in change!). There was a roach on my plate that was brought to me as well, which I refused to use."}
{"text":"For a buffet, I thought this place was pretty good. Food was authentic, the food and spices were prepared the way I remember real Indian food tasting. They had a good selection, even though I had no idea what half of it was. I think next time I may go to an Indian restaurant instead of buffet simply because all the flavors started to meld together and I like just one dish to enjoy, like chicken marsala or curry."}
{"text":"The best Indian foods ever! I went here for lunch twice & they're good & cheap! Looking forward to come here again!!!!"}
{"text":"I finally visited again and it was even better than last time! Everything I had - lamb vindaloo, lamb boti masala, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, paneer tikka masala, gobi manchurian, basmati rice, naan, kheer, chai, and mango lassi - was delicious. Easily one of the best buffets in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch buffet at a reasonable price.  Drove 20 minutes to get here and well worth it!"}
{"text":"India oven is....ok.  Satisfying? Yes. Tasty? For the most part. The best thing about this place is the service. The wait staff are attentive and efficient.  The buffet selection is good.  If only the quality was better. Over all, its not bad. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"food was delicious. dessert was delicious. price was delicious. customer service was good. for a buffet, they are pretty good. I'd give them 3 stars if it were a regular restaurant."}
{"text":"Easily the best Indian buffet I've had.  I went to yelp for suggestions on an Indian buffet and tried this place.  I normally don't do buffets, but with Indian, I wanted get a sense of what they had to offer.  

The food was fresh (I did go early), and I liked that they didn't have the tandoori or nan in a warming bin, rather it was brought hot and fresh.  I really liked the fish vindaloo and the paneer masala...I had two helpings of the paneer masala!  I also liked that they had two lamb, two chicken (not counting the tandoori), a fish, and several vegetarian dishes.

The service is great especially for a buffet.  I don't know what the food is like late into a buffet, but early into a buffet the food is excellent.  The service was outstanding.  I would go to India Oven over any other buffet I've had, whether Chinese, American, or what ever.

Worth the 15 minute drive.  In fact, I'm going back again Friday!  This time I won't give my son my portion of tandoori chicken (which he loved)."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The staff is friendly and fast and the buffet is a great value. I'm not normally a buffet fan, but it's a great way to try multiple dishes in the same visit. I highly recommend it and my entire family loves this place."}
{"text":"I should've known this meal was hopeless when our waiter brought my dining companion non-alcoholic beer instead of the real thing.  Thankfully he did not make this mistake with the wine however it still puzzles me as to why he brought the bottle to the table for inspection but did not think to also bring an implement for opening it. 

The chicken tikka masala was almost passable but the assorted appetizers we ordered were pretty woeful. A tiny little plate of dried up little bites, almost indiscernible in flavor from one to the next.

Suffice it to say, India Oven is not worth putting on your list of \"must dine at\" spots in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I just moved here so I cannot compare this restaurant to other places locally. I ordered my food to-go which was a smooth order and ready exactly 20 min later for pick up.  I'm a vegetarian and ordered the Bhartha, vegetable samosas, rice and plain naan. All were good. The bhartha was a little more tomato based than I am used to but the flavor was good. Everything else was good. I cannot say the food was the best I've ever had so I am looking forward to trying their lunch or dinner buffets, I hear they have a real balanced non veggie/veggie selection so that is awesome in itself."}
{"text":"Went in not expecting a buffet, but after looking at the menu and then the items on the buffet table, we went ahead with the all you can eat. The food was delicious and had a nice home cooked taste to it. We left full and satisfied, but with all buffets I probably won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"Just took one of my best friends here and we both agree... This place is by far the best Indian good in Phoenix!!!  Be service is spectacular and the good is extremely flavorful.  They are very attentive and even though they were very busy, managed to check in us and make sure we were good.  Highly recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Quality and variety are still there. We came for dinner on a Saturday night and the place was packed. We were seated in about 10mins, not bad. Food was great again, beer was ice cold ;)
A great place to try if your new to Indian cuisine and if your a veteran than you'll enjoy your meal ;)
Owners and staff are very nice and helpful if your confused on food choices."}
{"text":"A nice buffet, well stocked with authentic food and nice atmosphere.  The mango Lassi is included with the buffet a definite plus. Will repeat."}
{"text":"My new favorite Indian restaurant!!! 
My son and I have been here twice since we discovered it two weeks ago.
The buffet is huge, with several selections with chicken and lamb and several selections vegetarian.
The service is excellent and the staff is wonderful.
The owner stops by to make sure all is good and your happy.
So deserving of five stars!"}
{"text":"India Oven and I have a love hate relationship. I love the amazing buffet selection, the delicious Indian spices, the incredible service, and the to-good-to-be-true price.  I hate the fact that it's so scrumptious that it's impossible to stop gorging to the point of food coma induced discomfort!

Throw in the fresh sizzling Tandoori Chicken at dinner and I never need another Indian restaurant in my life, EVER! Mini is such a great guy and an equally awesome server, and he never judges my wife's and my clear addiction to their food.

Run, don't walk to the India Oven, but don't say I didn't warn you about the inevitable food baby, and that's no naan-sense."}
{"text":"I'm actually half indian, so I know a bit about indian food. I totally love indian buffets because there is always SOMETHING to eat. 

NOT HERE....besides everything being out and soggy and cold and DRY tandoori chicken that was ridiculous.

The samosas were oily. There was nothing worth eating. How can you make a curry that tastes like NOTHING? I mean, really?

Also, they definitely overcharge for this buffet. Is it because this is Vegas? Not sure I know why they would charge for so a meager buffet that isn't really good.

Well, one time, that's it. I won't be going back...in fact, I was tempted to call my credit card company and stop payment.... :)

Oh, it also did NOT help that there was an annoying man at a nearby table selling some Multi Level Marketing scam at these innocent people...he was so loud we heard every word of his conversation, I wonder if he called Clarence back?

The waiter/greeter/whatever knew this man was annoying the other diners, but was AFRAID to approach him and tell him to stop talking on his cell phone on SPEAKERPHONE... whatever. 

I don't write reviews to be mean. I write lots of good ones when I am happy. But when you give them the opportunity to fix things and they just do nothing, well, that's just not acceptable."}
{"text":"I have already been to India Oven many times since I moved to Arizona. My initial reaction to having their food was, \"it's just OK\". It started off with being average SUPER spicy food, even to me and I do enjoy a nice kick to my food but that deterred me from returning back for a while. With few Indian restaurants in the valley, I returned a few more times to give this place another try, hoping that I will change my mind and enjoy the food more but it was still just OK. The only time I kind of thought the food might actually be getting better was a few months ago when I went with my husband for dinner. I decided to only pick the dairy free options and it turned out to be a better experience so I decided to return again on Friday hoping for the best. Unfortunately, my experience was disappointing. 

So we arrived at 5:30pm for dinner on a Friday night. They open at 5:00pm so I was hoping I was gonna get fresh food having arrived at the beginning of the dinner buffet but the exact opposite happened. Everything was just warm, some of the food in the buffet was even cold! My thoughts: is this the lunch buffet leftovers?!

I started with a samosa and some pakoda. The samosa dough was made perfectly, but the potato filling didn't have flavor. Pakoras were just ok too, nothing special. I then went for the main dishes. I had some plain rice and had the dhal makhani, the lamb vindaloo, chicken curry and chicken tikka masala and a bit of the chicken and veggie biryani. Everything was average, warm to cold and believe it or not, not spicy at all! What ever happened to the SUPER spicy food?! I understand that they may want to cater to the bigger population here and tone it down a little (and toning it down a little would have been great) but to get rid of the heat altogether I think is a mistake! I'm sure a lot of people come to Indian restaurants particularly to enjoy the flavors and the spice! This was what an Indian would call, \"bland\"! 

With my food, I also had the mango lassi. Normally, this would be the most delicious drink you could order at an Indian restaurant. This tasted like melted mango ice cream & it wasn't even cold.

After I finished my dish, I decided not to go for seconds and just went for dessert. The first problem I had here was the bowls! I picked up one and it was sticky on the bottom, when I flipped it, it was dirty! I had to go through at least 3-4 bowls before I found a couple which were not too bad! I tried the mango custard and the kheer as well as the gulab jamun. The custard which is usually good had a bitter after taste so I decided not to eat it. The kheer had a piece of lettuce in it so I removed it and still had it; it was OK but there was no taste of cardamom which is what makes the kheer special. The gulab jamun was also ok, not warm enough though. 

I thought I would finish my meal with tea. It unfortunately did not have much flavor and it was was just warm. I don't like warm tea, it has to be hot for me to enjoy it so I only had a couple of sips.

People may question my review because I am not Indian but I am someone who was brought up in Dubai where more than half the population is Indian and we had Indian restaurants or cafeterias at every corner, we had Indian neighbors, colleagues, friends, you name it so I am someone who grew up eating Indian food at restaurants and in people's homes from my early childhood and for over 33 years and I used to love it!!! 

This meal has unfortunately disappointed both myself and my husband. They get 1 star for food and 3 or more stars for service but service alone is not enough to make us return to India Oven again."}
{"text":"The buffet for vegetarians wasn't good at all on a Saturday afternoon. No biryani, no starter. Some of the curries were bland and did not taste good at all. Not worth spending money for the buffet."}
{"text":"Not bad, but wheres the meat???
If you're vegan, ok. Had the buffet and vindaloo,
with almost no meat.
Cheapo's here think chicken is expensive or something!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! My SO and I tried it out after looking at all the positive reviews, now we go at least once a month. These guys will almost certainly cater our wedding. I just can't praise them enough."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with everything on the lunch buffet. Look forward to trying it for dinner."}
{"text":"I have clients in the area, and i make sure i dont eat breakfast!
The establishment is VERY nice.
The staff is EXTREMELY attentive, not over bearing, you will not ever have an empty water glass.
The Naan is just absolutely DEEEEEEEEEEEELICIOUS!
Love the curry! and crave it every other day.
The lunch buffet is just under $10 with tax. But always leave a good tip!
That spicy green sauce for the salad, OMG! SO good!"}
{"text":"I live in Seattle where there is a large number of Indian restaurants and this is one of the best I've ever tasted.  Service was polite, food amazing.  Can I take this restaurant home with me?"}
{"text":"Today, I went to India Oven for lunch. The waiter seated me in the corner where I could not interact with any one and no one could see me. As I looked around there were about 10 to 15 customers and I was the only Indian. All other customers were white. Now I know why I was asked to sit in the corner.  I call this seating based on race.  If you are an Indian, stay away. If you are white, go enjoy the food.  Overall, the food was good.

I hope other Indian restaurants get a clear message that all money is green. Seating should be based on first come, first serve and not race."}
{"text":"This place is a great value with some delicious food. The buffet has a good variety of meat and vegetable dishes and the fresh naan is on point. The dinner buffet includes fresh sizzling tandoori chicken that is delicious. The lamb vindaloo is another one of my favorites. The warm tea and mango lassi are nice add ons. I tried the rice and mango puddings for the first time on my last visit...I'll be saving room for it from now on!"}
{"text":"Tried the lunch buffet. After enjoying  Indian cuise for 40+ years, I rate this place a 5 out of 10.
Nothing too exciting to write about."}
{"text":"There are few places where 5 grown men can go and eat their fill of absolutely impeccable North Indian cuisine the likes of which I had yet to have tasted outside my home town of Fremont in California, accompanied by a never-ending supply of sweet, cool, creamy mango lassi at no extra charge; throughout, consuming a gut-busting pint of a bright and crisp, wheaty Taj Mahal all while being graced with the type of service I've only experienced traveling abroad - for less than US$100.  

Did I mention they have the cleanest public men's restroom in the entire valley?  With an f-ing chandelier in it?

Basically what I'm saying is: eat there, be merry, and for the love of god please leave a nice tip because I'll die if this place shuts down."}
{"text":"I have yet to find 'quality' Indian Food in Arizona, and I am sorry to report the India Oven continues that trend. All Buffet's are one star or less in my book ... here I'll stretch to 1.5 stars. 

Ordering directly off the menu the Indian fare rates 2.5 Arizona stars, as good as gets in this valley.  I'm sure they could do better, unfortunately at the India Oven the focus is on the buffet. 

The people who recommended this place to us also suggested The Angry Crab, what a disaster that dining experience was! (See my review) If you want 'fresh' Mexican seafood from the Sea of Cortez a mere 200 miles to the south, go to Baja Joe's. If you want frozen BS seafood, there's an ocean of choices throughout the valley. 

If you are looking for 'quality' (not quantity)  try the uniquely different dining experience at Rania's ...  a few miles down the road at Higley & Baseline.

I guess we all have our priority's in life, cheap buffet food lies at the very bottom of my list."}
{"text":"Very good buffet, friendly service. Comfortable setting and reasonable prices, especially considering proximity to Las Vegas strip. Going back again."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch buffet and food was ok...

Chicken curry was bad. There was no butter chicken but they made Egg curry out of it which was good. Didn't really like anything else much.

Service was slow and not polite."}
{"text":"Really tasty Indian buffet. Fresh naan, vegetables, desserts, rice, meats, you name it!"}
{"text":"This is a great little find, the place itself is a little seedy looking but the food especially being a buffet is amazing. You get good indian food at a great price, about $12 per person for all you can eat, they have it marked for non vegetarian and vegetarian food so you can choose what you prefer but its all nice. My first visit one of the dishes with lamb was a little chewy but everything else was good, last night my second visit it was all good, none of the meat is fatty very lean. They bring naan bread to the table and that was nicely cooked, great with the sauces from the meals.  I say give this place a go its worth it. You could go to a different restaurant, yes it could look a bit more modern but you pay more for that, why. The staff are very helpful, someone commented to attentive, I'd rather have that than not attentive. Another good point is after both visits no one had any tummy troubles, always a good thing to know in case you are concerned. Well worth the visit and good value for money."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The staff is helpful and friendly. Food is great with a wide variety of dishes. The price can't be beat."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I have every had and service is outstanding!! My family is Indian and this is the only place we ever go to eat. Great for large groups as well."}
{"text":"For my graduation dinner, I have been dying to get my hands on some authentic Indian cuisine, and after many hours of research, I decided on this restaurant.

Best decision ever.

It's a smaller, cozy restaurant with a buffet and bar in the back. The place is a little darker than most food stops, but it adds to the ambiance. Dark wood and murals cover the walls, and they have booth or table seating.

You can either order off the menu or do the buffet option, which we chose. For about $10.95 per person you get endless Naan bread (buttered with cilantro- very good) and however much you want of their buffet. Their buffet features all of their most popular dishes at a medium to mild spice level with a vegetarian and meat section. They also include a small section for warm and cold desserts, salads, condiments, fruit, and fried delicacies. There's even a tall keg of mango lassi. Overall, there's a lot to choose from and you won't leave hungry. I can barely move as I type this in all honesty.

I made it my goal to try everything. Which I am proud to say I did, and I loved it all. Their lamb dishes (two available at the buffet) were some of the best lamb I've ever had. My dad and I agreed it was the most tender we've had yet. The chicken dishes were amazing with the meat being tender as well. My parents enjoyed the Tandoori chicken the most, cooked on the bone in their traditional clay oven, with a slightly sweet and spicy sauce. Personally, I thought the lamb dishes were the best. I don't remember the name of my favorite, but it was with a thicker red sauce- Masala? Not sure. Don't quote me on the name!

They had lentils, a mixture of potatoes and cauliflower on the spicier side, these potato-like dumplings (I thought they were meat balls until I saw I was in the \"non-meat\" section\"), Paneer Tika Masala (cheese, not tofu, and very good), carrot halwa (like carrot cake but without the cake part- so only spiced, sweetened carrots that taste a little like honey cooked down to a pudding), gulab jamun (a small fried ball of dough sitting in a sweet syrup- like a donut turned custard), and at the very end you can find potato samosas, fried potatoes, and this fried zucchini bread that is savory, not sweet. Everything was good, no complaints. 

On the more dessert end, the kheer or rice pudding is like a traditional rice pudding just using the thinner Basmati rice. My parents thought it was tasty but prefer a thicker rice, while I like the more custardy texture. But what we both could not get enough of was the mango custard with pineapple in it and the endless mango lassi drinks. We are not huge mango people, however both of those were so delicious. A mango lassi is a sweetened mango yogurt smoothie that you need in your life. If anything, just go and order that. Seriously. So delicious.

The service here was phenomenal. In all the restaurants we've ever been to, they have by far the nicest, most down to earth, staff. Our waters never got below halfway full before someone would come and fill our glasses. They would check in every now and then (not obnoxiously) to see if everything was to our liking, or if we wanted more Naan. They always said welcome to every new customer, always said goodbye, and the manager even held the door for us as we left. Never in all my days have I had such exceptional service. 

In the end, my dad was the only one who was still on the fence with Indian food (other than the naan, lassi, custard, and lamb) because he isn't used to the spices. He's more of your classic meat and potatoes kind of guy. But my mom who isn't big on trying new things enjoyed it more than she thought she would, and would come back. I love the use of saffron and curry in the dishes, and plan on taking all my friends back here when I can. What will make the biggest difference though is looking into Indian food before you go if you're not used to it, that way you don't freak yourself out when all you see is a bright red sauce and meat with a name you can't pronounce staring back at you. Although even if you don't, just try it. It tastes better than it looks, I promise! I will be returning, and this is now my new favorite restaurant. Try it if you haven't. Don't let prejudices get in the way of enjoying some amazing authentic Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, usually for dinner but today I went for lunch.  I expected the lunch buffet to be inexpensive because the dinner buffet is only $9.99 (what what?! yes, please!), but the lunch buffet is $8.99 (not as exciting, boo).

Nevertheless, the food is always delicious, the service always fantastic, and it's one of my fave Indian places I've been to.  

Will probably stick to the dinner buffet though because I'm not that keen on spending $14 on lunch (for buffet, Diet Coke & tip) and then being way-too-full the rest of the day because I couldn't stop eating all the deliciousness."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out and was not disappointed. It was delicious!

Although I called to place a to-go order twenty-five minutes to close, they accommodated my order and I ran to pick it up right away. I ordered chicken tikka masala, rice, and garlic naan and it was downright superb! My only small complaint was that the the spicy was much more mild than the Indian food I'm used to, but I'm sure they're just playing it safe. If you like spicy Indian food, I would be sure to ask for extra spicy."}
{"text":"I have been going here for a few years now, but never wrote a review until now. They are well deserving of these 5 stars. I always do the buffet and honestly there really doesn't seem like a reason not to do the buffet. The food is amazing and tastes great. A must try for anyone wanting Indian food."}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic service. The staff made sure I always had naan and water in my glass, and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Sooo good!!! Food was delicious, the servers were super nice, the place was clean... I  cannot complain. I was in and out and everything was great"}
{"text":"We're back from another lunch buffet at Indian Oven. Since we're leaving the Phoenix area in a few days (we were just visiting), this was our last meal here. I decided to try the Tandoori myself this time, even though the buffet still offered only legs (drumsticks), which I don't usually eat. WHO CARES what part of the chicken it is? This seriously is the BEST TANDOORI EVER (well, that I've had). Probably the best Tandoori in the world, but since I haven't tried most places in the world that's a bit of a leap. But it is That Good. 

Also outstanding is their Garlic Naan; a 10 out of 10, easily. And the Mango Custard deserves special awards, too. I don't know if I've had it elsewhere, but if I did it wasn't memorable (but it is here). The other buffet items range from high average to excellent. Service was even better than last time, with our plates vanishing each time by the time we returned to our table. We were given 4 pieces of Naan initially this time, so no need for a refill. This is a solid 5 star now, in my mind. I love this place, and might have to consider moving to Phoenix ...."}
{"text":"Bad service high prices. This place gets overcrowded during long weekends.

I went for a lunch buffet, had to wait 30 mins for naan. 

If they want to serve lots of people during holidays they should increase their staff to provide a Better service.

Food is average, very limited options considering the price they are charging.

Only advantage they have is very few Indian places in town."}
{"text":"When we pulled into the parking lot... I was skeptical to be sure. But inside, clean-tastic decor from the 80's abounded. The posse of owners presumably, were very amicable and did not kick us out even though we were there just before closing. Samosa's were decent and palak paneer appropriate. Garlic naan a PLUS. But cheesy decor and too attentive wait staff made India Oven exactly what it was for us- a last resort for Indian Cuisine."}
{"text":"At last, I found a favorite Indian restaurant.

The big feature has to be price.  $10 / person for a buffet.

Service is outstanding.  Staff is quite friendly.

Food is solid.  I must admit I am no connoisseur of Indian food.  I do know I found a couple of dishes I really liked from the buffet."}
{"text":"Great Indian food and excellent service... My wife  and one daughter are gluten free and our waiter took the time to walk her through each dish!"}
{"text":"I'm not big on Indian food, but I have a friend that swears bye this place. Being new to the area I went with her and I have to say it was pretty good.

I only had the Nan, veggie samosas, and a taste of her entree (some kind of eggplant dish that was really good). I wasn't incredibly hungry but everything looked good.

I also tried King Fisher which was an amazing beer, the service was friendly and went out of their way to make sure we were good, I'm pretty sure my water glass never got below 1/2 empty.

I will be going back to hit up the full menu some time soon"}
{"text":"Decent. Certainly can't complain much with an $11 lunch buffet price, but some of the items were bland and cold. Decent vegetable curry and tisala."}
{"text":"It didn't blow me away. I was expecting more based on the reviews. Granted, I've seen more Indian people than I thought I would since I moved to AZ, but where I use to live there was a large population of Indian people and restaurants - hence, in my opinion, some of the best Indian food I've ever had. Likewise, nowhere else can touch the Mexican food I've had since I've been here - populations = good food to follow. Anyway, with that being said, it just doesn't measure up. Everyone has there ideas of authenticity, but to me, it just wasn't good. The tikka masala was heavily creamed in a nauseating way, but seasoned well and very spicy. The rice lacked any seasoning, from what I remember. The mango lassi was good, but I've had store bought that's \"good\" too. Too expensive to just be good.  That was the most irritating part. I was also irritated by the fact that rice didn't come with anything. It all had to be purchased separately. A clear money-making scheme. So essentially, if this meal was about 1/2 the price it would make sense. To drop close to $20 for a subpar dinner, never again."}
{"text":"Some of the best service I've ever had at a resturaunt. We stopped by for lunch and found out they only do the buffet. They had a few options for curry dishes, but unfortunately no butter chicken or Saag. I didn't love the buffet but they had great Mango Lasso. Tons included for the lunch but next time we're planning on returning for dinner."}
{"text":"Not a fan at all, I have had amazing Indian food, and this place just wast good at all! the curry taste watered down. The only thing I can say was ok is the nan ! Will not be going back again !"}
{"text":"Had a very small Buffet Item line, for lunch, but it was overall good, and very quiet inside. 
What I really Appreciated was the amount of Naan they supplied our table with, was pipping hot and very good! Since we were a bigger party, they made sure that their was enough Naan togo around and were not stingy about it. 
The Marasala was good, the Samosas were actually fresh and had just come out. It's hard to get fresh food at the buffet, but it was good that we came at time when the food must have just been out. 

over all yum stuff!"}
{"text":"I'm been in Vegas for the last week looking for employment.Being a vegetarian my options are limited.I came here a few days ago after a half of a day of hitting the pavement ,and i was just looking for a basic meal.What i got in return was one of the best meals of my life!

Clean interior with an excellent lighting and wide enough tables to support a group of 4 people.The neutral colored walls were very warm and relaxing..perfect environment for a date.The tables were clean and decorated as they are in higher end restaurants.Im not saying this place is low end, I'm just saying its in a regular non special area where extra special frills aren't really needed to sell great food...I also took notice to how immaculate everything around me was.The staff was great!The Indian/Hispanic hostess guy (whatever he is),saw that my meal was enjoyable and that my glass never stayed empty.The rest of the family stayed on top of their responsibilities as well.

The food was top notch and seasoned to 100% perfection.The only thing i didn't like was the Keer.It was OK, but the pieces were a little too big.Oh btw, i came there during lunch buffet around 2:30.There weren't that many people in there so i cant really speak in regards to service when its more busier.They must have read the reviews about the slow service of naan because i had my naan in less than 5 minutes.All i know is that i was accommodated well and this is my new \"GO TO SPOT\"when i come over here to Vegas to do temporary work."}
{"text":"Mr Harmony enjoyed this place. Great place to get good Indian food with no reservations or wait. Full bar a plus! I recomend."}
{"text":"Insipid food, bad service, naan was stale and sky high prices. Please avoid. They had just 2 people waiting 8 tables. Decor was not upto the mark."}
{"text":"If you want original Indian food this is the place. It might seem a little weird in the beginning but this place is amazing. I love the buffet but specially the vegetarian food is delicious. Best place in town. With their amazing mango like ice cream."}
{"text":"\"Jewel in the desert\" that's how I would start my review. I have been living in the valley about 5 years and from past three years we stopped going to Indian restaurant. When you know a cuisine inside out, you have your bars high this is how you feel. Most of the Indian restaurants do good business but not great food. But Indian Oven says you serve great food and also good business.
  I went on a week day and still found some great food. Here is the list, they have 5+ both chicken and lamb and 8+vegi dishes...if you count the dishes i will say easily18- 22.Now that's on week days. The chicken makhini and lamb vindaloo were great and they also have Indian meat ball curry....awesome and you will not find it anywhere. The palak paneer is authentic trust me you can still see the palak and its freshly made paneer. Do not forget to have all the deserts as every desert they have is the best and you need it after have some spicy food. I would not be doing justice if I do not mention their freshly served...freshly folks... naan in the valley...yep they see you then they make it and it's the best naan you can have . The taste and freshness of each dish and the authenticity is 5star and serving fresh tandoor on sizzler wants me to add another star. 
       The people including the owner will ask you about the food and refill your water every single time. They take care of you throughout the time. If you are not going to this place...you are not eating real Indian food.(period!!!). I felt the owners have set tehir bars very high fortheir food cleanliness and service and you can see that. I wish India oven all the best and pray to god they stay forever...."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by an Indian coworker.  He said the food was very good, and reasonably priced.  So we decided to check it out.

For our first visit we opted for the buffet.  A way to try several dishes at once.  All the food was very good!  My one negative would be that the vindaloo was not spicy.  A good vindaloo is VERY hot.  But on a buffet they have to appeal to everyone, so they can't do that.  Next time I'm ordering from the menu!  Allowing for that, everything was very good.

The buffet  had a selection of chicken and lamb dishes, plus vegetarian, and several desserts.  They also had Indian chai tea, and a mango drink.  The naan bread was very good, too.

My coworker was correct.  Easily the best Indian food we've found in the Phoenix area.  No contest."}
{"text":"Okay, so I love indian food. The Indian oven was a fun experience. I got the buffet so I tried a little bit of everything. Everything was delicious on the first trip, but when I went back for seconds everything tasted just okay. The food is prepared mildly so that everyone can enjoy it. This was a problem for me, seeing as I like my food hot. The service was very pleasant, the owner even asked me if I was a model! I don't think I will go back, but I had a nice time. I think this would be a good place for Indian food beginners so they can find a dish they like."}
{"text":"We make Indian food at home but we e been hesitant to eat at an Indian restaurant. Today we found ourselves on the east side at lunch time and didn't want to eat the same ol thing so I decided let's try India Oven! I am so glad we did. The atmosphere is nice, clean and inviting. Everyone working was super helpful and had fun with our 1 year old. We tried the buffet which again is a first and again I was really glad we did! Fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"$9.95 for the dinner buffet that includes tandoori chicken and perfect garlicky naan brought straight to your table.  I'm pretty sure I had about $7 in naan myself.  How can you beat that?  Well it takes more than price for me to be happy.  It takes good food, and India Oven has that as well.

I'm not usually a fan of buffets...food is often not so great and sometimes the choices are limited.  But in this case, neither of those applied.  I checked out the buffet before sitting down, and found quite a bit to choose from.  I tried most of the dishes.  In a few cases, I didn't even know what I was eating, but I knew I liked it!  I did find it a little odd that we walked in at opening, yet a few things were barely warm though.  Also, if you like things hot, you may want to order off the menu as the buffet is quite mild.  The sizzling tandoori chicken bumped this buffet up to 4 stars.

Definitely worth the drive, and I don't say that about many things.  I hate driving."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Indian food, so I cannot really compare the experience here to any place else.  However, I do know when something tastes good, and that was certainly true here.  I echo the sentiments of other reviewers with respect to the service, it is very good and the staff is very welcoming.  There isn't a whole lot of need to into great detail on what was best (you can try it all, after all) but I will say that I found the vegetarian dishes to be better than the meat dishes overall.  The free chai tea and mango drink was a nice touch.  The food was mildly spicy for my taste, but I prefer a lot of spice.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very good Indian buffet food. May not be the best, but very good. The naan was good, but took awhile to show up. By the time it showed up we were almost done. The vegetable korma was good but the veggies seemed frozen. Overall they had a nice selection. The dessert were very good."}
{"text":"Two of my favorite items are on the buffet today- samosas and mutter paneer! They also make an excellent carrot halwa!"}
{"text":"Wow.  I don't even know where to begin with this review.  I will not rattle off all of the names of the dishes to try because quite simply every single dish I have tried at this place is absolutely fabulous.  We always go for the buffet because its the best way to taste a little bit (or a lot) of everything and the price is unbeatable.  The staff super friendly and courteous!  The spectacular food and a nice tall cold Taj makes for an unbelievable dinner...or lunch.

This place is five stars all the way!   When you compare what you get for your money elsewhere, this place takes the prize.  Every person we bring to this restaurant is amazed and you will be amazed too!"}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly staff. Haven't ordered from the menu, but have eaten the buffet on several different occasions.  Also includes desserts, mango Lassi and fresh Naan that is delivered to your table. Affordable prices."}
{"text":"Can't beat the price ! I gorged myself at the dinner buffet and happily accepted my food coma later! Awesome that the mango lassi is INCLUDED in the buffet! The paneer tikka masala was my favorite! Only minus a star because our group needed more garlic naan and we are pretty sure the \"refill\" came from another table that had just left. Um, thanks? That still doesn't take too much away from the deliciousness that was the meal."}
{"text":"Outstanding buffet selections for the carnivore and vegetarian.  Thoughtful, kind and attentive wait staff.  I don't think we could have had a better Indian food experience outside of Mumbai."}
{"text":"I've only gone here for lunch buffet, but I have to say the food is tasty and the rice is seasoned just right.  There's not a huge selection for the buffet, but they do offer both vegetarian and meat selections.  The prices are good too.  I'd come back definitely."}
{"text":"We just tried the lunch buffet and it is AMAZING. Try the kafta for sure, you won't be disappointed. The chicken was all so moist and everything is so flavorful, and the staff are so nice!"}
{"text":"9.95 for this delicious food? Sign me up. This place is twice as good as Dhaba, half the price and fantastic service. Dhaba \"You're Fired!\""}
{"text":"Delicious food, amazing staff, good price. I came here for the buffet and found out they had mango lassi on tap! This place is a gold mine, by far best punjabi style Indian buffet in all of az. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I can be pretty picky about Indian food and have been disappointed by several places around the valley. This place, on the other hand, absolutely wowed me. The dinner buffet had an exceptional number of choices on both the meat side and the vegetarian side. The palak paneer was smooth and creamy and perfectly spiced. Same with the vegetable korma. The spices were well-balanced, very flavorful and an adventure for the tongue. There was just the right amount of heat, and as usual, I cooled it down a bit with a spoonful of raita, which was also delicious. There was Mango Lassie on the buffet, a great treat! My favorite dessert was there as well...gulab jamun. Try them! They are delicate balls of sweetness drifting in a wonderful syrup of cardamom and Rosewater. When we sat down with our first plate, our server brought us a sizzling plate of tandoori chicken which was fantastic. The host was friendly and checked on us several times to make sure we were happy and pleased with everything. There is a bar with a decent selection of liquors, although we had Taj Mahal beer that night. The decor was fun to look at. I can't find anything even mildly negative to say about this place. I'll be going back regularly."}
{"text":"My date took me to India Oven one Friday night and though I was bit skeptical of a buffet that served Indian food I was pleasantly surprised!...The buffet was just the right size and offered multiple chicken and lamb dishes in an array of sauces including curry of course rice, salad, fritters and some desserts that I didn't get to try...they also bring out fresh naan bread and a sizzling skillet of chicken with onions and peppers...We were like, \"Wait we didn't order this\" and the server said, \"Don't worry it comes with the buffet!\"...Wow all of this for $8.95!!! I'm sold!!! 

Overall
Good food
Attentive servers
Great change from your \"typical\" buffets"}
{"text":"I am new to the area and have been craving Indian food.  This place exceeded expectations.   My only complaint is I got full.  I mean they make naan fresh upon request.  Plenty of variety and only 10 for lunch.  Also, great service to compliment the food."}
{"text":"How can anyone go wrong with this dinner buffet? Everything is super delicious and you can even take dishes home by the pound! I especially love the sides and garnishes included in this buffet - such as garden salad, fried onions, chickpea crisps, wonderful house dressing, yogurt dip (raita), tamarind, mint chutney and last but not least the fresh cucumber salad ( finely chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, fresh chilies and red onions - kind of like a pico de gallo with cukes). All of these things are brilliant accompaniments to any dish! This super stimulating buffet offers very rich, creamy, spicy and savory veggie and non-veggie options. Even non vegetarians will love the hearty and comforting vegetarian dishes! They start to wrap things up at around 9:30, so be sure to arrive at least by 8:30 to get everything at its optimal freshness and to allow yourself a decent window of time to oink out. 

And how can I forget the complimentary garlic naan, mango lassi and desserts! Wind down and cool off with fresh Indian sweets! These quality desserts put a perfect end to your meal. Great service and atmosphere. Excellent overall!"}
{"text":"Had heard about the dinner buffet and decided to give it a shot. Happy to say I was pleasantly surprised with everything. The staff are so attentive and eager to make sure you are having the best possible experience. Tried the majority of both vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes. Vegetarian dishes are just filling and satisfying as non vegetarian."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here when they'd just opened, and we're fans to this day. The buffet, open both lunch and dinner, is at a cool $10/adult, and is the best bang for your buck of any Indian restaurant I've eaten at. Food's fresh, and dinner comes with fresh unlimited naan and a sizzling tandoori chicken and kabab. 

I don't think any sane human being ever goes to an Indian restaurant for its service. But the staff is great. The management know us and if they're in, come out to say hi, and the waiting staff are nice and frequently checks in. 

If you're vegetarian, half the buffet is just for you. I don't go to Indian restaurants for veggies but I make an exception for this place. A big fan of the paneer and pakora."}
{"text":"My first visit to India Oven was on my 28th birthday back in December. The owner and his wife came over and wished a me happy birthday. They are so nice! 

I learned to love Indian food from my friends in London... this stuff lives up to what Indian food is all about. Great currys (mild to spicy) and tika masala. Hot and fresh buffet with great service."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to get India food in Phoenix. I was traveling out of town (Cali) and randomly stumbled upon this place. The food and service was good and the buffet prices are decent."}
{"text":"This place was great YEARS ago when they were on Sahara. Things have changed since they moved. I remember eating here a few years ago and the food was bland. Things haven't changed. All of our dishes looked like the dish but tasted like nothing. On a higher note, the naan was amazing!!!!

PROS: On Restaurant.com
             The Naan

CONS: Chicken Korma - tasteless sauce
             Lamb Seekh Kebab - one flavor overpowered the entire dish
             Baingan Bharta - needed more flavor in general."}
{"text":"We moved to Arizona from New Jersey 16 years ago. My husband and I first date was at an Indian restaurant. It became our favorite and he proposed to me there as well. So Indian food has always been a family favorite. When we moved to Arizona we looked everywhere for a good Indian restaurant and were sadly disappointed. Last year, my husband found India oven through Yelp. We went and we love it. Seriously love it. Their food is great, their prices are awesome and the staff is super friendly. I can't say enough how much we love it."}
{"text":"I really like how they have the buffet separated into vegaterian and non vegaterian sections. Not sure what I'm eating only sure that it tastes delicious! Service is unreal. We saw another table leave and 3 people went over and started clearing the tabe off even pulling out the table and chairs to sweep underneath."}
{"text":"Fresh food, excellent service. The buffet is wonderful with good variety! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I read through all the reviews on Yelp before trying this place. I'm always a little wary of buffets to begin with, but even more so when it's an Indian, Thai, etc buffet. They always seem to fall flat in every way possible. But since most of the reviews were positive, I decided to take a chance and drag the gf out for dinner. 

And I'm so glad I did!

We showed up around 6:30 and there were already cars in the parking lot. We were seated in a booth and immediately brought water. We let the server know we were getting the buffet and went at it. The selection was pretty fantastic. A good variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian options. Three lamb dishes, three or 4 chicken dishes, aloo gobi, two different paneer dishes, salad stuff, and dessert. 

My plate was piled high with all my favourites, and my gf took this chance to try just about everything having never had Indian food before. I have to say, it was some of the better Indian food i've had in Arizona. (I feel like I can say that, not just because I'm a foodie, but because I spent several years living in that part of the world and had many Indian friends growing up, so I was able to experience all types of Indian cuisine. )

The flavours were all there, and the different chutneys went great with the order of papadum that we got. It's an extra $1. Order it, if you've never tried it before. We got back to the table and we had a HUGE piece of garlic naan and a sizzling plate of tandoori chicken waiting for us, both of which were excellent. The desserts were a perfect ending. The cheese balls soaked in the honey lavender syrup were amazing, the rice pudding was great. They even had a sweet carrot pudding, but I didn't try it, not being a fan of carrots in general. 

You can't beat $10 a person for a great buffet that included all the usual suspects and some you might not have tried, mango lassi, tandoori chicken and naan. 

As we left, the restaurant was getting busier. There were several tables of Indian families, which I always take as a good sign, as well as a mix of others. 

We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great buffet! There is a vegetarian section in the buffet! All buffets should be this good. And the garlic naan was amazing and hot."}
{"text":"Ok, I never thought I would say that I go to a buffet but I actually LOVE this one.  Not only is the food, fresh, hot, and flavorful, but the service is top notch too.  You've got to give this one a chance, it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"I am surprised by all the positive reviews.
We love Indian food.
However, this place missed the mark. The Naan was burt and soggy, the chicken Korma was greasy, thigh meat seemed a little under cooked, slimmy? The chicken in the chicken tiki masala was very hard seemed old? Rice was dry. 
Mango Lassi, great. 

Otherwise not impressed."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to India oven all the time. We have been going here for 4 to 5 years. This is one of our favorite places to go!! The food is always good and the service is great! We have bean to other Indian food places, but none of them compare so far."}
{"text":"As a North Indian, I couldn't vouch for this place more! Most authentic Indian food I have had in a while, and so delicious! We live in chandler but the drive to mesa is always worth it. The spice levels are just right and the variety is amazing. Mango lassi and tea included !! Can't get better than that :)"}
{"text":"This is the first Indian buffet I've ever been to, and it is absolutely wonderful!  All the sauces are unique from the next and there are so many flavors to choose from.  The fresh, hot naan is glorious and there are a variety of delicious drinks as well (mango smoothie, chai, etc).  Also, the service here is unbeatable, something I would never have expected for a buffet.  

The restaurant is bustling but the atmosphere is great.  Low lighting, warm, friendly, and welcoming.  Tables are large for large gatherings."}
{"text":"Excellent!

Had a dinner get together with some friends that were visiting from India, and I wanted to have thier input as well as have good food as they are used to in thier homeland.

Everyone was quite happy the staff was very friendly and very helpful in explaining some of the dishes that we asked about.  Everyone had the buffet which was very fresh and very good.  Even a friend who was a litte intimidated at first quite enjoyed the food.  There is great selection between vegetarian and non-vegetarian."}
{"text":"My favourite food in the entire world is Indian food, and I like to think of myself as one of the connoisseurs of Indian food.  I travel specially to find the best Indian food.
This place is a gem. We had the lunch buffet, and had tons of items to choose from . The sauces were all so authentic and creamy and spicy and yummy, depending on each dish. They even offer mango lassi at the buffet to cleanse your palette. 
The staff here were actually better than some of the 5-star restaurants my husband and I go to. 
I have to say, this is food that everyone regardless of race or taste will love, there will be something for you that will make you want to return. 
Well done!"}
{"text":"I don't even want to give 1 star. The food is terrible. I have been to many other restaurants the food taste might vary but I didn't come across any spoiled/ rotten food. And the worst part is that when we asked them to take that out from the menu, they didn't. I am not sure how this place got that many ratings. I feel they should atleast consider the health of the customers while preparing the food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times because I LOVE Indian food, but.... sadly it's just not up to par. The staff is super friendly and nice and accomodating but even the Indian Curry in Japan is better than this. Of course, nothing is as good as having Indian food in the Middle East."}
{"text":"I love that they do a daily buffet.  Even though there's only 3 things that I actually eat on it....the chicken tikki masala, the white rice and the garlic naan.  That chicken is to DIE for...something about that sauce...so buttery yet kinda spicy.  The garlic naan is crazy good, especially dipped in that masala sauce.  I've only sat down once to eat there and remember the service was pretty quick.  Most times I just grab some to-go buffet food and jam out within 5 minutes start to finish."}
{"text":"I just left here and boy, am I stuffed! It's not everyday that you find an amazing Indian food restaurant that has a lunch AND dinner buffet.
And at such an affordable price! Lassis, Tea, Naan, and red chicken all included.
The mint chutney is way up there in my favs from all over the country, and no meal is finished for me without vegetable samosas.
I know it wont make a difference to many, but the only thing that withheld that last star, for me, was the minimal vegetarian/vegan options. I'm not too picky, but most all of the dishes were paneer, ie: with cheese.
Overall: pure deliciousness."}
{"text":"Food was really good.  Loved that there was veg and meat dishes separated in sections.  We had buffet for dinner for $12 each person. Would deficit come back if I come back this way."}
{"text":"Food was very good. But I am very surprised that people had good experience with the staff. I cannot stand poor service no matter how good the food is. I was so shocked at how rude the lady was with us! They gave us one piece of bread. When we finished it we asked for more, and they brought us a 1/4 of one, which is fine....assuming bread is expensive? NOT! But anyway it was not even cut with a knife, it looked like it was just cut with the hands. But that was also fine. When the first guy did not bring us bread, we asked the lady (who looked like the owner?) She said we had already gotten a refill but that she would get us some. Then she took her sweet time and 10 minutes passed by and neither her or the guy brought any. Finally she passes by me and I say excuse me....before I say anything else she snaps at me saying we had already gotten a \"refill\" of bread and that the place is packed and so I would have to wait and walked a way before I could even blink. My point is if they want to be stingy (mind you we got 1 and 1/4 breads) that I could deal with. But the attitude was a slap in the face. Again I cannot stand poor service no matter how good the food is. There was an older man who worked there who first seated us and was extremely sweet the entire time."}
{"text":"I was here for a lunch buffet because our boss kindly decided to treat us to a free lunch. This review is written with consideration that a buffet will never be quite as good as a freshly prepared meal, and I have taken this handicap into account. Bottom line-- they did a pretty decent job. 

The tandoori chicken was not the juiciest but it wasn't the dryest either. Some places have a tendency to screw up the coloring and turn the chicken pink but this place got it right, and the spices were intact too. They were flame grilled just right. I also thought the kabobs were pretty solid.

The biryani was so-so but it definitely tasted better than some of the other places I have had in town. I was impressed with the vegetable curry-- lots of sliced vegetables and rich, spicy curry. The yellow dahl (lentil soup like dish) was a bit runnier than I would have liked but it was actually seasoned pretty well. The channa masala (garbanzo beans curry) tasted just like the one I have been eating for years at my parents house. 

The tandoori naan was cooked just right and had that crunchy singe on the edges. The green chutney was thick and spicy, as it should be. I think if I were to try them for dinner that I would like them even more. For a lunch buffet, this is a solid choice, worth looking at."}
{"text":"Tonight we came in for the dinner buffet at 9:00 pm and was seated by a heavy set older man who rudely pointed at a table for us without even greeting us. At 9:18 pm they tell us last call for food when they close at 10:00 pm. After we paid the heavy set man comes back to the table very awkwardly and asks for the credit card and when I asked why do you need it he says I don't know that's what the guy wants. My point is do not come here after 9:00 pm and if you are seated by any of the other employees they are friendly and attentive just watch out for the big older guy. The food and service has always been great here in the past, but after this last trip it will be my last."}
{"text":"Thanks to Stephanie T for clearly pointing out the dinner buffet!

This was super satisfying and they really go one step beyond your usual buffet.

For one, they serve up garlic naan fresh and hot and don't charge extra. Some places will just give the regular naan and charge more for the garlicky goodness.

Two, they serve a piece of fresh tandoori chicken to your table instead of letting it just dry out on the buffet. (And its tangy! Me likes.)

Three, the mango custard dessert is better than average and there is fresh hot chai--all on the buffet. Again, no extra charges!

Oh yeah, and the regular food was pretty tasty. The buffet is laid out by vegetarian or not so if you're not a meat lover then its easy to find and decipher your food.

I had a nice glass of Cabernet which was just fine, no complaints.

All in all, I am satisfied and I like the feel of the whole place. 

The owner (?) came around and said hello and checked in and seemed to know many of the diners there (many hugs were going around) . Cool atmosphere. Homey."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner on a hot afternoon. Seated quickly for the buffet. Arrive early, as the tables fill quickly. 

Very good chicken tikka and chicken curry. There were also lamb and vegetarian dishes I did not try this time. 

Nice find. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went back for dinner, it was very good and everything was fresh.. Only difference this time was the price is now $12.95 for the buffet. Still a good value for what you are getting."}
{"text":"The very basics: We went during dinner time. The restaurant location looks sketchy, but the service was excellent. However, the decor and atmosphere are a little lacking. Buuut, our food was great...I guess it evens out in some way. 

I don't know if it was complimentary or because it was included with our dinners, but to start, we were served PAPADUM with two kinds of chutney (mint and sweet & sour). I've never had this before, but it resembled a thin taco shell. It sort of had a fishy aftertaste, but it was pretty good with the dipping sauces! I ordered the PALAK PANEER, which is my typical favorite Indian dish - pureed spinach and cheese, whipped up with a bunch of herbs and spices. So good! It came with RICE and a sizable NAAN that I shared with my boyfriend. He ordered the CHICKEN CURRY a la carte, which didn't include the former two. He wasn't really a big fan of his dish, though - He said he's had better chicken. Our server was attentive, and one of the owners even checked up on us once. 

The portions look small, but they're very filling. Indian food is so rich, piquant, with its blend of spices. Needless to say, we had leftovers to take home with us. (My palak paneer was still good reheated, a couple days later.)"}
{"text":"Mmmm... just thinking about my visit to India Oven makes me hungry again for Indian food! They have many options on their menu, but I only found two or three that were dairy free, so unfortunately for me, I could not try the good stuff. The dairy free options are tomato-based, which isn't my favourite. Nonetheless, the flavour is still really good. I only wish that rice or bread didn't have to be ordered separately. Also, I had ordered lamb as the meat, and it was a little hard, but lamb is difficult to cook. I'll know to get a different meat next time. Overall, the food here is really good and leaves you craving more!"}
{"text":"I give the lunch buffet 5 stars. Chicken Marsala, chicken curry , lamb Marsala and lamb with other sauce. Meats are lean or at least what I've eaten so far.  Definitely dark meat. At 6 different vegetarian options. Salad and a couple side items. Tea and a mango fruit drink are included.  Three desserts today. The soaked donut balls, mango pudding and carrot pudding. 

I'm impressed.  I'm glad I came upon this restaurant.  It's about $10 without a drink.  Very reasonable. Good for families of your kids like curry. Good choice in proteins. Yes.  
The website is good and detailed also. I appreciate that."}
{"text":"This was my first time, but my hubby had been here multiple times.  We ordered lamb kabob that was tender, moist, and just amazing.  The vegetables with the lamb were fresh and tasty, and cooked perfectly.  We also ordered a spice chicken dish and it was unbelievable good.  Best of all was the bread that we couldn't get enough of.  Only negative was the location, as the late night loiterers were a bit scary."}
{"text":"This place. OH MY GOD THIS PLACE.

I've only ever been here for the lunch and dinner buffet but it is glorious every time.  Someday I shall come here and order from the menu.

Chicken tikka masala! Pakoras! Vindaloo! Paneer! Korma! Tandori! Huzzah!! Its all excellent!

This place is far superior to the nearby Guru Palace, both in taste and price!

Dave Lister of Red Dwarf would be very happy to stumble upon India Oven. The man has traveled the galaxy in search of a good vindaloo and a curry. I wish he was real. And here. I would love to share a curry with Dave Lister. Rimmer and Kryten can come too."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants in town. Their mango lassi tastes so good no one can beat it, other restaurants try but they fail. Love their chicken tikka. Best of all is their butter chicken. Omg I can almost taste it."}
{"text":"Amazing prices and delicious food. Tons of vegetarian options, and chai and lassi are included in the buffet. Real tandoori ovens make for awesome naan. Most definitely worth a stop. Come with an appetite!"}
{"text":"Really bad food, I was in Las Vegas craving for indian food and I visted this place... the food here is hopeless they serve frozen products as freshly prepared food... I think this place is a joke.... the food is really below par, I mean$13.00 for a veggie that too, awefully prepared.... 

Waiter was rude and unprofessional... served food as if he was doing us a favor"}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB and I can't get enough of eating here. I eat here at least once a week now. The food and service is top quality all the way. It is best little secret in Mesa! 

The buffet has everything you could want and is very very good. The garlic naan is one of the best ones ever. It is soft hot and fresh!  The dessert mango lasso is the best ever. 

If you love Indian food or if you have never tried Indian food....this is the best place to go!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I'm definitely not an Indian food expert by any stretch of the imagination. The first time I tried it was at The Dhaba so my expectations were really high. I should also mention that I am totally not a buffet girl and the creepy one way wall behind the buffet didn't help. Handy for checking to see what needs to be changed out though. All that being said, I did enjoy the food, it was good. It just wasn't amazing. I'm sure they have to tone down the spice to make the buffet appealing to everyone, including those who like it a bit mild. If you're looking for above average buffet food and in the mood for Indian, this would be a great choice!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best Indian food I've had in AZ, maybe my life. I hated being that \"two many plates at the buffet\" gal but I really wanted to pop my jeans open and keep eating. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. I don't have a negative to say. It will be part of my regular rotation. I'm just bummed it took me three years to find."}
{"text":"After living in a culturally rich city with great Indian cuisine, one would think it'd be hard to match all the way out west here in Phoenix. However, while India Oven may not be the most authentic experience, it certainly matches the quality of any Indian restaurant I've dined in.

The atmosphere is warm and inviting, but not overdone; simple and straightforward. The staff are both welcoming, friendly, and attentive.

Their dinner buffet, which is what this review is largely based around, is $11.95 with a respectable spread. They've got an equal amount of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options with chicken and lamb and even have mango lassi. Overall, all of the meat dishes from lamb vindaloo to tandoori chicken were all clean and amazingly tender; none of that annoying grizzle or dry chewy meat. One of the most exemplary examples of this was surprisingly, the chicken curry: clean, tender, moist, and flavorful. Even the chicken in the bryani was moist! In total, the flavors in all of their dishes were strong and savory, but at a mild spiciness level accessible to outsiders (aka me). The naan is brought around fresh and has a great aroma and taste, if not just for the fact that it's fresh.

However, even though the food was all very very good, a lot of the flavors were new and different to what I was used to. For instance, their tiki masala dishes tasted more tomato-based more than creamy, their saag and daal had other flavors aside from spinach, the and even their vindaloo tasted different. Again, this is not to say that any of the food was bad, as this was certainly not the case, but their style was definitely new to me. While I understand I am by no means an expert on Indian cuisine mostly eating dishes targeted towards westerners, I felt India Oven's style of food was both unique and accessible to those new to the genre. Their spice level was lower than what I'm used to, their flavors were clean, yet still touching on those deep mixes of spices, and there was nothing overly adventurous or intimidating at the buffet. 

All in all, I definitely see myself being a repeat customer with India Oven now being my go-to place for affordable, great tasting Indian-style food with friendly staff and tender meats. And in the end, authentic or not, even though they may not fall in line with the norm, the taste and quality of their food alone makes me a fan. We're maybe even treading into 5 star territory."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat Indian Food!  I've tried other places , but the Chicken Tekki Masala here is always the best.  Perfection is more like it and probably my favorite dish here. Of course you have to have the rice and some garlic and cheese nan.  Oh and to start the mango chutney is always a must aswell!  For sure this place remains my favorite place!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. They have a great selection. The price is reasonable. Service was prompt and friendly. We will come back again!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to find a buffet for dinner, in our experience we have not found very many Indian buffets around. Indian Oven did not disappoint. The food is delicious and I was surprised to find saag, my all time favorite. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"went back a second time and tried the buffet and it was awesome. I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Came in for the dinner buffet while we were in town for a weekend softball trip. The place was clean and open and the wait staff were super prompt and friendly. The buffet had the main Indian dish staples, chicken tiki masala, chicken curry, vindaloo etc. we also got complimentary naan which was nice. The taste of the food was great! I did not walk away with that typical underwhelming feeling of mediocre buffet food. Next time we are in town we'll definitely stop by again. The price was well worth it too! Great quality and great food. Keep it up India oven."}
{"text":"1St Indian food experience was a pleasant one.   Great value in the buffet and staff was great."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is flavourful and delicious for the price. The staff is friendly and accommodating! Definitely a keeper for Indian food!"}
{"text":"First off let me say that I dont get the chance to eat Indian food as often as I would like. . . and that is because we don't have any good Indian restaurants in the central phx area. So when I ended up in the East valley today I had to check this place out due to all the good reviews!!! 

I was skeptical and on edge that this might not be the experience that I was hoping for...maybe too spicy ...or old food under heat lamps...or bad service...NOT THE CASE!! THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!! 

India Oven is 10 out of 10 for me. 

Service: 10 
A smile and a greet as we entered with the wonderful aroma of the buffet made it easy...I was in the right place. Our waiter was very professional and personable. He made our first experience Great as he told us about the chef and his 40 yrs of around the world cooking from Europe to India to the USA. I couldn't wait to go taste his cooking. They also have a Full bar in a classy environment. Great place to take a client for lunch or date for dinner. Quick side note: India Oven is not that big and I'm sure once the word gets out...expect a wait. Great 42\" LCD on the Wall , so we got to watch the College game. 

Buffet: 10 

Let me just say at first glance .... I was Lost and my mouth was watering... it all smelled so good and everything and I mean everything was FRESH. The Chicken Curry, Lamb Curry, Chicken Marsala all were Fantastic! We were told by the staff the buffet always changes for lunch and every dinner service. I cant wait to try other dishes from this place. It was all soo good .... you will want to keep going up til you explode. They also bring Indian bread and a Sizzling plate of chicken and Lamb to your table that also was amazing. 

Price: 10 

At $9.95 you simply can not beat it. 

I just wish this place was close to the house. I would def be a frequent customer. I would also be gaining a few pounds. Do yourself a favor and try this place out. I can seriously say I dont think you can go wrong."}
{"text":"Authentic curry based recipes. Large selection of foods on the buffet. They serve mango lassi and masala tea :). Great service. We will come back."}
{"text":"Very reasonable priced, but charge for extra rice or dessert - should he included.  Warm and inviting decor and authentic Indian cuisine.  We're traveling and seeking a good vegetarian option.  They have a whole page of vegetarian options.  Service is a little slow, but very friendly , warm and thorough.  Looks forward to our next Vegas trip so we can come back!"}
{"text":"I've said it before and I've said it again - one of my biggest issues with Indian food in America is that is disgustingly sweet. Cloyingly, tooth rotting, horrifyingly sweet. Sadly, India Oven is no exception.

I came here for their buffet lunch and left after small scoops of rice, chicken tikka masala and palak paneer. Service was wonderful and friendly. Garlic naan and tandoori chicken is brought to your table and not on the buffet. I'm not a fan of tandoori chicken - I never have been. I ate a little bit so it wouldn't seem like I didn't appreciate it. Yea, will never be a fan of tandoori chicken...sorry.

Overall, the service is great, but I wasn't a fan of the food. I don't like sweet Indian food. It's not the stuff I grew up with."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian Buffet I've had (out of a dozen or so).  1st I've seen here for a buffet:: _fresh_ garlic naan delivered to table, mango lassi, _thick_ sauces, mango pickle didn't cost extra, and buffet at dinner (not just lunch).  On top was good service, a nice number of vegetarian and meat dishes, and 4 or 5 desert options on the buffet."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Unique food with a self serve setup. Authentic and fresh.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner during our trip from AZ to LA. We were super hungry. Delicious palak paneer, soft naan and quick service. My best dinner in the past few years. Though a bit pricey, I felt the price was worth it."}
{"text":"We both walked out patting our satisfied bellys after our first visit to their buffet. They had a nice variety of veg and meat options..chai and mango lassi included as well as rice and naan. Good service and decor..we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"After a frightening experience at the MVD (\"welcome to the great state of Arizona, we don't process new driver's licenses during the last hour because we want to go home early today\"), I needed something delicious to calm my angst.  I pulled up Yelp, searched for top-rated restaurants in the area, and we slid into India Oven.

My party included my wife and my toddler, so we didn't know what to expect as far as our behavior (and subsequent treatment from the waitstaff).  Before I comment on the food, I have to commend our server and the rest of the staff for being incredibly accommodating and entertaining.  They all appeared generally interested in our experience there and our delightful server even filled my son's sippy cup (which was often nearly full) probably 10 times -- easily my boy's favorite part of the restaurant.

We chose the buffet and were delighted to have a sizzling plate of chicken drumsticks and onions with a basket of naan to accompany our buffet choices.  The layout remains unchanged from previous reviews: non-veggy, vegetarian, and \"salad/dessert\" sections to choose from.  The aromatic rice was the perfect base, though it was strange to serve myself out of a rice cooker.  Each meat/sauce I chose complimented the rice well, but the lamb was easily the winner.  I ate way too many plates, the sign of a good buffet.

I only knocked one star off because growing up, my wife's Indian neighbors would cook the most delicious, fresh Indian cuisine; the food at their wedding last year was along the same veins as Indian Oven and the aspect of freshness (and, presumably, the presence of ingredients of slightly superior quality) took that wedding variant to the next level.

The food was good, the service was excellent, and our experience was great."}
{"text":"Although the AYCE buffet is an awesome deal, dinner is when we like to come the most! The staff recognizes our one year old daughter and already know her love for mint chutney and mango lassi! They also know she's a very messy eater and never mind her messes and are always smiling and playful with her. 

The reason we come for dinner is because we can get our curry the spiciest they can make it vs the buffet where it's made for the general public's taste. We love this place so much we eat here almost once a week for family dinner :)"}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner.  Did the dinner buffet, which was $13/person. It was worth it!  They had non-vegetarian and vegetarian section, along with some awesome samosas.  I enjoyed the Chicken tiki masala. Service was very attentive and quick. I really enjoyed the food here."}
{"text":"YUM! Been here twice now and I love the service and the food. It's a cramped space with steaming serving trays with a good variety of Indian foods just waiting to be tried. At the table they bring you a baked flat bread with cheese and for dessert an Indian style rice pudding and peach pudding."}
{"text":"Came to visit family from SF and was craving Indian food. We Yelped and found this Gem.. The food was amazing. And the service was great. Very reasonable as well. THANKS"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try India Oven based on Yelp reviews and I am so glad we did. The food was delicious and the service was wonderful. The spice level was perfect as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the food is good, served hot every  time we have had diner.
They are always busy so it is better to  call ahead and reserve.The owners are really good folks. they care about their customers.Food was  served fresh and hot every time. They were able to get us some very special diet request that some of friends had. I highly recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"This Place ROCKS!!!!!!

IF you want pure authentic Indian food then look no further. I had a business meeting in Gilbert, and was driving back home and needed to find an Indian restaurant to check out. My GPS and it pulled up Indian Oven, so I thought I would check it  out. The atmosphere was exquisite . I did the buffet as I usually do for Indian food. The lame curry was AMAZING!!! and I was surprised to see it there during the week because lame curry is really expensive and is usually on the dinner takeout or dining in. The next big thing I'm  picky on is the bread, because most of the Indian restaurants tend to burn it losing the flavor. This bread was soft and fluffy and they lightly spread a garlic and butter over the top with Olive oil. I live all the way on the west side 111 Ave, and I'm going to come to this place tomorrow!!. The meat is soft and melts in your mouth, the bread is so white and fluffy with seasoning its like a cocaine addiction keeping you coming back for more. The service was a spot on, my waiter kept my diet coke filled and that soft fluffy bread on my plate. My only complain is that I wish I wouldn't have to drive so far to get REAL INDIAN FOOD. If there is one thing you need to do on your BUCKET LIST before you kick-off you need visit INDIAN OVEN IN ARIZONA PLEASE.

Good Eating To All !!

You Honest Opinion Steve"}
{"text":"My husband and i are fairly new to Az. After being here about 2 weeks we when to Indian oven.  I will not be back. They stare at you the whole time you are eating. very uncomfortable.  I asked for more nann bread and i guess i committed a sin because i was given the dirtiest look.  Buffet is small, not many choices.
Only thing going for them, they have a dinner buffet, but thats not enough for me to be back.  I now go to Guru palace. They are Very friendly and they don't stare you down while you eat."}
{"text":"I have been going here for a few years and it is kind of a love hate relationship. They are consistent and the food is some of the best Indian food in town but the service is usually terrible and they are very expensive. I do prefer them over Gaylord at the Rio which has a much nicer dining room but it is even more expensive than India Oven. I wish Yelp had half stars, I would give this place 2.5"}
{"text":"Just another Indian Buffet.  The food quality seems to a little lacking.  I usually judge and Indian Restaurant first by #1. Palak Paneer (If they offer it.) The dish is made with sauteed spinach and paneer cheese cubes.  The spinach was ok tasting, however, the paneer (which should be a \"house-made\" cheese) tasted like tofu!  Nothing against a perfectly prepared tofu, but this \"cheese\" was rubbery and tasteless.  They did have a few different selections (of the \"usual\" variety) that were acceptable....Chicken Tikka, lentils, curried veggies, cold (better when hot) prakora (a spicy deep fried dumpling thing). The naan bread was hot and fresh and mango lasse drinks was chilled.  However, those were the only few highlights of the meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing service amazing vibe! I would eat here everyday if I didn't work throughout the open hours!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here a couple of months ago and the food was tasty and the service was decent too however a German cockroach crawled across my table during my visit. I called my server over to show him. He killed the roach and brought me a bill? I politely informed him that I would gladly tip him but I am not paying for my roach infested meal. He then brought a mgr to my table who told me that I got full and should pay. I almost called her out of her name. Smh. Never again. I did tip my server though. I can't believe this heifer tried to make me pay but I have to shake out my purse and sweater before I get in my car to make sure I'm not carrying unwanted visitors. You know I called the health dept. right?"}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic place to eat if you have never had Indian food or want a dinner buffet for a very reasonable price of about 12 bucks.  Very few indian restaurants  have dinner buffets, but this one is expansive.  It is broken down to vegetarian, non-vegetarian, desserts, bottomless mango lassi, and all you can eat naan.  The spice level for the buffet is definitely on the low side, but the freshness and variety of the food more than make up for it. What I really like is is that all the dishes are labeled, hence my statement about this being a great place to eat for those uninitiated in Indian cuisine.  

The interior is almost cafeteria like, and they were playing very odd synthesized Indian music.  Two TV's on the wall were playing a Bollywood movie.  The staff was really, really nice, patient, attentive and accommodating. 

The Bhel Puri was actually the star of the meal.  It is one of the best Indian appetizers I have ever had.  Seriously.  Tangy, sweet, crunchy, savory, all in one bite.  The sampler plate was standard fare of pokora, samosa, etc, except it was super salty.  It was good though and I would order it again.  Finally, the fish masala had tender mahi mahi in a tangy tomato cream sauce, and was ok, as was the chili vegetables.  

Overall, a very solid three star restaurant with a killer deal on the dinner buffet, great service super casual environment."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great selection on the buffet and fabulous service! I am not usually a fan of buffet meals but this was the perfect choice. I highly recommend India Oven!"}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet and it was OK.  Chicken was not of the best quality and I have had better indian food and many other restaurants.  I think people must give the good reviews due to the $9 AYCE pricing which is definitely a good deal... but if you prefer quality over price, this may not be the right place for you."}
{"text":"One of few good Indian Restaurants in Valley. They have buffet and menu for dinner and lunch. They have good variety of vegetarian option if you are off meat."}
{"text":"I suggest you carry drawstring pants if you're headed to their buffet!

The food is absolutely fabulous, the vegetarian selection is particularly varied, and there's all-you-can-drink Mango Lassi (although be warned... it can fill you up). The pakoras were a delight, and so was the Paneer Makhni. Servers were prompt and courteous. And if you finish before the rest of your party, you can always sip on some Indian tea while you wait.

The one item that didn't quite appeal was the Gajar Halwa (Carrot Halwa) which was far too sweet, but since there were 3 other options to choose from, I didn't mind it much. The gulab jamun are evidently the best I've had in the United States till date. Can't imagine what's their secret."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss for me. I've been here twice and ordered takeout once. The first time I dined in, it was pretty meh. There was nothing special about it. 

I gave it another shot because my brother wanted to go there, and the next time it was actually really good. Loved the flavors; everything tasted really good. So I thought maybe the first visit was just an off night. 

But the last time I got take out, it wasn't that great again. The meat in the chicken curry was fatty and gristly, and the tikka masala was oddly orange--almost unnaturally so. So I don't know what's going on here. But to me, the prices are too high to risk getting subpar food since you never know what the quality will be on a given day. I'd say look for a more consistent place. I intend to."}
{"text":"Man this place was good.  If you haven't ever tried Indian food, like me at the time, you definitely have to come here because they have so much to choose from, and it's pretty much all very good and authentic.  

Price was very fair at like $13 for the buffet, although they do offer regular service as well.

Will definitely return to this place next time I feel the need to stuff myself with Indian food, which, thanks to this place, I have on a somewhat regular basis now."}
{"text":"Tried almost everything on the dinner buffet. Everything was simply fantastic. But my FAVORITES were the chicken tikka masala, palak paneer and the mango lassi. All the meat was incredibly juicy and tender. They had TWO lamb dishes! Never have seen that at a buffet. Perfect amount of spice in every dish. Great service and hot garlic naan brought to every table. Ended up eating more than I should because it was amazing tasting. I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"The service and the food were awesome. I had the lunch buffet at around noon. While we were eating our meal, they brought us fresh bread and also a fresh piece of chicken that they said came complementary with the buffet. You could tell they took pride in their business, I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"We organized an India Culture Dinner Party in their banquet hall for ASU MBA students last week. We were well over 100 people and it was a great evening. Lovely food, great music and drinks. Thanks India Oven, we would come back again next year."}
{"text":"I have been here many many times.  They know me and my usual order so I thought I better give them some love on yelp.  

The buffet is excellent, but if you want it spicy you have to order off the menu.  

My favorites are goat curry extra spicy and lamb masala.  Both are mouth watering good stuff."}
{"text":"Great buffet and you can't beat the mango lassi!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Indian buffet! Great options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. The naan is so good and so is the mango lassi!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Indian food restaurant near me!

The buffet is generous and has a lot of variety. For the price, you can do no better on the quality of the food. Savory, not TOO spicy, and always fresh and hot. They even bring the naan right to your table and refill it constantly. Yum.

My only complaint is that the front door was filthy.  But, hey, break out the Windex and  the problem is solved. :-)"}
{"text":"I've been going here at least once a week for the last four years. Great buffet, the staff knows my family and our orders and we are always greeted by big smiles. I love all the food and the staff. I've eaten at a lot of Indian food restaurants in this state and this is the only one that's really stuck with me."}
{"text":"My Girl loves her some Indian food, so she suggested (by waking me up) that we should go to India Oven for lunch and then some java afterwards. Myself I am not too big on Indian restaurants, so far I have limited exposure to them and the few I have been to recently have not really been that great. However, being the open-minded boyfriend I am, I gave it the good fight and went along with her idea.

It was lunch time and they has a small All You Can Eat Buffet for I think it was $10 or $11. BTW It took me a bit to catch on that when people on yelp were saying AYCE, they meant \"All You Can Eat\"... yea I guess I can be slow sometimes and BTW means \"By The Way\" just in case... grins~ ok back to the subject. LoL - \"Laughs Out Loud\" ;p

As I was saying the buffet was small and limited and ranged from dried up meat kebabs to nice tender Chicken Tikka Masala, A mutton stew, along with the various vegetarian dishes like Palak Paneer (spinach and farmers cheese), Sabji Samosas (vegetable fritters), Daal Makhni (creamed lentils) and a few others. So overall the buffet was home to maybe 12-15 items and their Naan bread does rock. My girl also ordered the Sweet \"Lassi\" homemade yogurt drink, which she loved.

It was slow so the waiter was always there when we needed a drink refill and was courteous when doing so. Our bill came to $31 and some change for the two of us, which is not bad for a lunch out to try something different, but I still have to say I have yet to try for myself an Indian Restaurant in Las Vegas that I could not wait to go back to eat there again.

That said, I am sure that many of you would enjoy the food, especially the vegetarian assortment of dishes and my girl says the dinner menu is better.

{"text":"Although the selection at the dinner buffet was limited, what was there, was very well done. Butter chicken stood out, as well as the free flow of mango lassi!"}
{"text":"I went this restaurant for food it's very good and tasty too but their service is bore and they charged my 2 y son too he doesn't  eat any thing but they charge so I never go this place"}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews. We arrived later in the evening shortly before they were closing, but the owner was gracious enough to  serve us. The servers were very attentive. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and it was delicious. I also loved the mango lassi. I particularly love hot spicy foods, and their level of spice did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Methi malai was good! So was the malai kofta! I only got 2 pieces though... ordered the dinner of it as well. So you know it wasn't a lunch portion either."}
{"text":"Came here with my Indian friend who said she would not be embarrassed to take me here for the food. So i thought that was a sign of good things to come. They have a buffet which was affordable (less than $10) with great selection (vegetarian, meats, mango yogurt, desert, etc) If you want other dishes, they got a full menu as well. I thought the food was great. Every dish I tried were flavorful and fresh. They even brought out fresh warm naan came out when we sat down at the table. YUM. 
Oh and they gave us a hot plate of chicken as well (maybe this is also complimentary?) Anyhoo, I would totally come back here for an insatiable Indian food craving."}
{"text":"good awesome fresh food. we ate at this place all the 4 days we stayed in las vegas. Good portion and quality food. awesome paneer tikka masala and naan bread. They say best bread! i would recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for lunch today.  Now just for clarification my wife is not one to enjoy foods that are ethnic.

She left this place raving.  The lamb was delicious as was the basmati rice.  Hmm the naan (flatbread) was divine.  Even the deserts were delicious: cheese donut thing, carrot pudding, and this amazing mango pudding.

The two of us enjoyed a delicious and filling lunch in a wonderful atmosphere for about $20 bucks. Not bad!"}
{"text":"So it is amazing like all the other reviews. I would say be adventurous. Try everything. I think some of the best items were the things I wasn't too sure about. This was my first time at any Indian restaurant. It is very tasty. Let me warn you incase you live under a rock, Indian is spicy. They use a lot of curry. I came by myself because my wife does not do spicy. The only non spicy thing at the buffet was salad. And a few desert items."}
{"text":"I am absolutely not an Indian Food Guru, but this buffet was definitely worth it. The food was hot and mostly tasty, the free tea was good, and there was some kind of cheese dish that was awesome. 

I believe all the meat entrees were chicken, so if you're not a chicken fan, you're out of luck. One of the vegetarian dishes looked like a meatball that had no taste, not sure how that worked out since it was smothered in sauce, but eh, the rest were good. Another had an initial flavor that was overwhelmingly lemon but had a nice, complex aftertaste, so it evened out.

The other reviewers that mentioned the staff standing near your table and staring were not kidding, especially if you are seated next to the entrance.. but this also means that if you get low on naan or water, they will already be at your table offering replacements.

You can do much worse for 9 bucks."}
{"text":"While visiting PHX, got a craving for Indian and this place hit the spot.  A lot of buffets I have been to will have chicken tikka masala but not as many places will serve up lamb vindaloo which is my favorite.  I enjoyed both.  The lamb vindaloo could have been spicier but I just asked for some hot sauce to turn up the heat.  
The garlic naan was great.  A good selection.  Clean establishment.  Friendly and attentive service.  Great reasonable price."}
{"text":"I order from this place all the time. Food is amazing and consistent.The restaurant is very nice and quiet, great to wind down."}
{"text":"This review is limited to the lunch buffet. The food here is all pretty good, and for a buffet the quality of the food is fantastic. My server was friendly and kept the hot Naan coming. I will definitely be here for the dinner service and back for the lunch buffet sometime too. A great little place."}
{"text":"We drive from the far east valley to have India Oven just for takeout! We do love dining in, but taking out is just as satisfying.

Indian Oven is a small, family-run restaurant.  The buffet is daily, or you may order off the menu. Most offerings, however, can be found on the buffet. The tandoori is flavorful and spicy. The tikka masala, both chicken and paneer, are a wonderful blend of vegetables and spices, in a texture to penetrate your perfectly cooked rice just enough. The saag and other offerings are plentiful and tasty as well.

From the menu, try a qeema naan one day. It is essentially a stuffed naan. Perfectly cooked and delectable.

Dessert items such as golub jamun and whatever the awesome carrot stuff is cool the palate, as does a nice cup of mango lassi (also offered on the buffet).

The prices are meager for the high quality food and service you receive. The staff remembers you when you come in, and is always attentive. Another bonus: India Oven is open 7 days!

If you enjoy Indian food or are looking to venture to something new, give them a try."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I crave it every morning right when I wake up!  Best food & the lunch buffet is an awesome deal!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always fresh and they keep the naan coming. This is where I go when I want to get my chicken tikka masala on!  Try the carrot pudding for desert. I know it sounds a bit weird at first but trust me. This recommendation is coming from an avid Indian food eater. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I moved here from MN and have been looking for a good Indian restaurant, well we found it. 
We stopped in for lunch and they had a buffet and it was great!!!. Food is fresh, wonderful flavor and a friendly staff, Price was good as well. I would recommend India Oven for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This has been on my to try list for some time and after an auto service appointment, I came here for a late lunch/early dinner.  The restaurant is fairly small but it's very nicely appointed with tablecloths even for the lunch buffet.  Nice touch.  There is no TV so you won't be watching Indian MTV.  Instead, there's quiet music playing in the restaurant which makes it conducive to conversation.

The pakoras and samosa I had were probably the best I've had on a buffet.  Crispy coatings that had not become softened by sitting in the warming pans.  Very tasty fillings also.  The chicken curry had some bite to it which is always a plus.

While enjoying my first plate, I was brought naan.  There was no choice of garlic or plain naan.  Everyone gets plain naan.  I'd prefer garlic so this is a negative.  I had some chicken kabab which was different from what I was expecting.  It's ground chicken coated and cooked.  Something different but it didn't grab me.  The dahl curry with pakora was very good.  A different dish again and one I really liked.  The one piece of chicken tikka tandoori chicken I had was juicy and had a good flavor.  I finished my lunch with some very good kheer.

I missed the idly and samber (sambar) until I had eaten too much and didn't want to force more.  A good reason to return.  

Another negative was the lack of food in some of the containers.  There was one piece of bone in the goat curry and I didn't wait for more to be brought.  The same with the kheer.  I did ask for more and the container was refilled in the kitchen and brought out.

Service was quite good with water refills without asking and plates removed while at the buffet.  This could be a four star with a little bit of adjustment on making sure the pans have food in them and a choice of garlic naan would be nice.

I found the place very relaxing and the interior was very classy."}
{"text":"Only 2 high chairs in this restaurant?  My son just sat on our laps the entire time.  Not even sure if one opened up while we were here but we never ended up with one nonetheless.

What's up with being so stingy with the nan?  We get a basket to start but there's not enough and then you wait 20 minutes later for another one???

Food selection is very slim too.  There's gotta be better options in Vegas..."}
{"text":"i would love to give it zero stars if I could, (Yelp? maybe a feature you can implement??) anyway, bottom line I WISH i'd stopped by here and read the reviews before plunking down $26 on 2 lunches we could never get back!!
food is disgusting, bland, tasteless, hopeless, worse than mediocre, and I could go on and on.
there were total of 5 dishes, and rest of the lunch buffet was filled with lettuce, onions, chutneys, yogurt dips with no real veggies to actually dip in. the samosas were leaking of oil, pakoras were nasty didn't taste like pakora batter but stuffed with some dal of some sort to save money, the curries were GROSS ugh!!! and when u enter, u see all these awards plastered on the walls??/ who is handing these out???
don't go here...its full of retards serving nasty food that'll make u barf whether u're hung over or not."}
{"text":"Santi and I came to this Indian restaurant after seeing all the raving reviews on Yelp. The horizontal interior was dim lit and cleanly organized. A combination of meat, vegetarian items, salads, desserts, lassi and chai summed up their buffet options ($8.95). There were plenty of open booths and tables with the capacity half way filled. It is an appropriate place for quiet conversations with a good number of servers who circled the floor to refill water, distribute fresh naan, and bus the tables.

Among the meat items, the Lamb Vindaloo was not spicy at all. The cubes of lamb were cooked really dry, and the same could be said about the Lamb Boti Masala that didn't fare well with my taste buds. The Chicken Tikka Masala and Tandoori Chicken were dry as well. I do not recommend any of the meat options.

The buffet came with a good number of vegetarian options. I enjoyed the Saag and Mushroom Mattar, which I went back several times for. The best items were their Green Beans Potatoes, as the flavor was complex and noticeably spicy. The Daal Makhni and Paneer Tikka Masala were overcooked, but the flavors were complex to my liking.

The chai and lassi tasted ordinary, and the fresh cut fruits were not appetizing or sweet.

Overall, their vegetarian items fared better compared to the rest of the meal. In the entire buffet they only had one item that was spicy, which showed that they were catering to a particular audience at the expense of their cuisine. On a positive note, their food was not greasy or heavily drench with salt or oil. I would have rated them higher if not for the Naan that was too thin, lacked good flavor and the doughy bite. Instead, it was flaky and crumbled at will. I had two separate batches of Naan, and each time the texture and flavor failed to meet my expectations.

Service by the male servers was friendlier, prompt, and efficient when compared to their female counterpart. To date, I still prefer Delhi Palace's buffet better. I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in the world.  I love Indian food, and I've tried countless restaurants over the years -- this one is my absolute favorite.  Favorite.  Heaven happens in your mouth with each bite.  

The service is superb -- my water glass is never more than half empty.  The servers bring out piping hot nan just as you run out, and they are all very friendly.  The buffet, which is what I always go with since I'm decisively indecisive, is always full of delicious goodness, never set out for too long -- and why would it?  This place is always full of people when I come, so the full turns pretty quickly.

For me, their selection is just right.  I've read some reviews about the selection being too minimal, but I believe in quality over quantity.  I've been to some Indian buffets with wider selections but a severe lack of the yumminess that India Oven provides.  

You can tell that love and care goes into each dish.  Recently, I tried some sausage that was cooked with the tandoori chicken.  I don't even like sausage, and it was delicious.  

Even their basic basmati rice is amazing; I could seriously shovel mountains of that stuff into my mouth.  

For dessert, I'm a huge fan of their mango and rice pudding.  So good and delicately sweet.  

To be honest, I don't even know what everything is called, but it's all so flavorful and delicious, my mouth is watering as I'm typing this review.

I marvel at the consistency of their cuisine -- it's always delicious, and it always tastes the same, which is great because that's how I want it to be.  I know this because I've been there so many times. 

My only complaint is that I wish they had somosas more often -- sometimes they do, and sometimes they don't.  But, you know, that's a minor complaint.  Even if they don't have somosas, I just end up eating something else that's equally delicious.

I highly recommend this place, and every time my coworkers or friends want to go out, I volunteer India Oven.  I live in Scottsdale, which is probably a good thing, because if I lived closer, I'd probably go every day and gain a ton of weight.  This place always gives me a delightful food coma."}
{"text":"Guuuuud! Great transition back into Indian food after suffering some Delhi belly on my recent trip to India. 
The buffet had a great variety of vegetarian selections and a good array of authentic desserts. 
Nan was fresh and warm and very good. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Buffet is really really good! Favorite is Chicken curry. Love the dessert! Custard and sticky rice. They gave us extra Mann bread , my husband didn't want to waste, so he asked a bag to take it away, the server offered the foil wrap and gave him an extra one. So nice!"}
{"text":"The BEST Indian buffet in the area. Wonderful variety of food and delicious offerings. Fresh naan is served continuously. The waitstaff is super accommodating and friendly. Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, food is fresh and amazing. The staff is top notch and always on the spot."}
{"text":"This review is based on my first time eating at an Indian place!

Went to this place as a suggestion from my friend,jon, who loves this place.

Went on a Friday night and it was pretty empty. There was about 5 parties there ranging from 1 to 6 people pet table.

The staff seemed pretty bored, which added to the boring ambience. There's nothing that makes it scream, \"Indian restaurant\". 

Our wait staff was pretty good, always there when we needed.

They gave us a little too much time to over view the menu.

I'll start off with the appetizers.

There's a complimentary plate of a baked type of chip? That's served with 2 different sauces. One was sweet and red like a thin chutney. The other was spicier and green like a salsa verde. Overall it reminded me of chips and salsa. 

We ordered meat Samosas to start. They're pretty much ground beef empanadas with Indian seasonings. Overall it was good, but definitely not a stand out I'd go back for. Very mild.

I ordered a tasting dinner.

This came with: basmati rice, naan, a goat curry, a chicken curry, and a shrimp curry. It was also served with a cool, cucumbery, white sauce and a sweet dessert cup.

The portions were good; enough to share.

Although it was all really good.. The food definitely tasted like it just came out of serving pots. The only one that seemed like the meat was stewed in the curry was the goat. The chicken and shrimp servings came off as if the chicken or shrimp was added into the sauce before being brought out. 

Also, the three different curries seemed to be of varying heat. The goat was most mild, then the chicken, and then the shrimp being the spiciest. 

I'd definitely recommend getting this \"meat dinner\" if you've never had Indian food. 

You get a little taste of everything.

The menu was definitely hard to understand. There's one goat,  one veggie, one seafood, and one chicken section each with about 6-8 different options to have your choice of entree in.

The descriptions really don't give any idea of what to expect from what you order. I.e. Chicken in spicy curry sauce VS. Chicken in very spicy curry sauce.

I hated the seating of this place. They should definitely get a new interior designer. The tables are so close with no booths! I felt like I was unintentionally eaves dropping everyone's conversations.

For food: I'd definitely give the food a 4.5 out of five. The only complaint would be my food wasnt served completely piping hot. One dish was warm while the others weren't ect. But taste was definitely awesome! All the curries were different like I ordered three different dishes and eating with naan or rice changed the tastes too.

Service: 4 out of 5. It was satisfactory and I have no complaints, but nothing spectacular.

Price: 3 out of 5. I'm a huge fan of Thai curry, but it just doesn't seem worth it for the price. My meal with one mango lassi(which was underwhelming) and Samosas($7) was about $45. It's about 2 cups of curry, rice, and naan for $21-24 dollars. 

I would definitely go back! But only when I want to splurge. I'd rather go get Thai curry :]"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indian food I've been to in the Phoenix area since I moved here from San Francisco. Some reviewers will say that having a dinner buffet is the best part of this place, but trust me, the food is amazing too. The lamb was meaty, the chicken very tender, and the sauces and gravies excellent. This is also the first Indian buffet that I've been too that has mango lassi as part of the price, and it's very good. Service was excellent and very attentive, again more than i would have expected for a buffet.

Trust me when I say you will not be disappointed, and if you save a few dollars in the process, all the better. We'll be going back on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch the other day, food was good and server was very friendly. However I just placed a phone order and the guy was so rude. Questioning my order, asking why I wanted what I ordered and not something else. He asked when I wanted to pick it up, then told me no after I answered,  he then told me a time that was 45 mins later. Not sure what that was about but I'll see what happens when I go to pick up my order."}
{"text":"Indian oven has a great Buffett and staff that is so friendly! My friends and I enjoyed two plus plates and the Naan bread. 
They have a non vegetarian section, a vegetarian section, salad section and deserts. The flavors are so good. Some spice and some sweet. Everything is very fresh.
Go for lunch if your feeling for some variety!!"}
{"text":"Worst dinner buffet. Can't describe more. It's very Americanized. Not for Indians. Especially south Indians"}
{"text":"Well, just had dinner there an hour ago, tried it because of a friend's recommendation.  I have to say it was just okay- a little more than what we would've spent if we had gone to India Palace.
The veggie samosa was very good, spicier than most I've had, the chicken tikka masala was good and the aloo matter ( they spelled it mutter) was alright too, but the mixed tandoori was quite a disappointment..little pieces of chicken, lamb and ONE prawn which they forgot to actually put on the plate and brought it out later! Not to mention when I split my lamb, it was still raw inside...meh...

Should've kept to our original plan and gone back to Indian Palace...oh well $88 bucks gone and we live and learn..."}
{"text":"Their lunch buffet is top-notch. You get over twenty options (I've been to Indian buffets with only 7 or so options) and everything is fantastic. Not what you'd expect for buffet quality, but the quality and care you'd expect when ordering individual dishes. Mango Lassi is included in the buffet as well!
The best part: unlimited, fresh garlic Naan delivered straight to your table. The service is phenomenal and as soon as you get down to one Naan, they immediately come over and replenish your plate. Extremely well priced, too. $10 per person."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian food restaurant without a doubt.  Their buffet is like no other.  They even serve Mango Lassi, complementary with your buffet.  Their staff is very courteous.  I would say that if you want to grab a fast lunch, you could do it there.  Their food is so delicious it is hard to pick just one item.  The Tandoori chicken is grilled to perfection.  Their naan bread is also great.  Sometimes, when I don't want to cook, I just pick up some Tandoori chicken, Naan bread, and Basmati rice and have that for dinner. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been to India Oven multiple times now, and it's so good! Sometimes there is a wait, but it's worth it!

The Food: Delicious! Even the buffet is good (and what I get almost every time), and I usually have a hard time with buffets.

The Service: The first couple times I went here, the service was hit or miss. Lately, it's been consistently better. They never let my water glass run out, which is one of my number one \"things\". The owner of the restaurant did take away some food I was eating once, but I don't think she noticed.

Plus: It's right next to a smoke shop. Score!

The Atmosphere: Kind of a modge podge of decorations, but fun and unique. It has a great bar setup.

Suggestion: Being a vegetarian,  I'm always worried about cross-contamination. I would suggest making the vegetarian food first on the buffet because some meat-eaters don't understand that the vegetarian spoon cannot touch the meat on their plate and then be placed back in the vegetarian dish. This is why I have rated it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.

Conclusion: Great food! I would eat here every day if I could. Just need to switch the buffet and this place would be perfect!"}
{"text":"Just visited last night with my family for a dinner buffet. Food was fantastic and delicious. Being an Indian sometimes is difficult to give 5 stars to an Indian restaurant, but it's well deserved. Hosts were good and so was the environment. My only suggestion would be clearly state their definition of \"Vegetarian\" (some people don't eat eggs) and also have some \"Vegan\" options clearly identified."}
{"text":"Food was good and filling...I had the buffet...which had a decent selection for the price...the people running the restaurant are very friendly. The mango custard for dessert is Yummy!"}
{"text":"The goto place for Indian food in the east valley. Masala is awesome and so is curry. Love the buffet plus the lasse and the tea. First went with wife then with family for birthday meal. Go early, can fill up fast. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Very classic things available for their buffet, especially the chicken tikka masala and the \"donut hole\" type dessert were AMAZING. Cucumber Rita was a bit bland compared to what we were used to from other Indian restaurants. Nice mom-and-pop type atmosphere, we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The chicken tikka masala was very good. The dinner special comes with basmati rice and naan. I also had a kachumber salad  with dinner and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying, there was nothing wrong with the food, the service, ambiance, etc. I am just not a fan of Indian Cuisine as I cannot tolerate even mildly spicy food. 
That being said, my husband and fellow yelper has always had his heart set on trying Indian food, and wanted to try India Oven for his birthday meal. I obliged, as it was his birthday, and he has been talking about this place for over a week!
We came in on a Saturday for the lunch buffet. There were vegetarian, and non-vegetarian options, desserts, veggies, salad and fried potatoes. 
My first time up to the buffet I tried a little bit of Chicken curry, the basmati rice, and chicken tandoori. I was hesitant to try the masala because I know they tend to be more on the spicy side. I LOVED the basmati rice! The chicken curry and the chicken tandoori were okay. Both flavorful with some spice to them. Now, for me, I thought they were both too spicy. (Remember this is my personal opinion as I cannot tolerate spicy food). As I made my way back to the buffet, I of course got more rice, fried potatoes and some salad. One of the servers came around a couple of times with the garlic naan and that was delicious! I could have made a meal just of the naan! 
I felt the place was clean, the service was friendly and efficient. I did feel as though the buffet could have had more choices though. In my opinion it was kind of skimpy. 
I am glad I tried India Oven with my husband, and I will probably will not visit again, NOT because of the food or service, but because of my personal issues with spicy food. 
Well done, India Oven!"}
{"text":"I've tried India oven as well as a handful of other Indian buffets such as Chennai fusion grill, Nandini, and Delhi palace cuisine of India. Out of all those I'd have to say India oven is the best and it's only $9 for lunch! 

Tons of meat and vegetarian options and they have the buffet area split into 'non vegetarian', 'vegetarian', and 'salad/dessert'. They bring fresh garlic Naan to the table and the curry tandoori and lamb are all well flavored. They even have mango Lassi included in the price!"}
{"text":"First time here and thoroughly enjoyed it. Love that the buffet has vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I have had Indian food in cities more well-known for diverse cultural cuisines than Mesa/Phoenix, and let's just say that India Oven will hold its own anywhere else.

I've usually come for the lunch buffet and this is as good as any other, if not better. I especially like that they offer saag for lunch, which is something I don't always see. In addition, they have an excellent paneer offering and chana masala. I also like their pakora. The thing that would make the experience even more awesome is if they put out some samosas, but I guess that might be asking too much. Naan bread is excellent, and to top it all off, you are welcome to serve yourself some mango lassi!

Service has been pleasant. I'm not even from Arizona but if I'm ever in town, I wouldn't hesitate to come back here."}
{"text":"Pathetic food and unclean chairs and environment. Useless place. No variety in buffet on top of all non sense"}
{"text":"Used to be a huge Indian snob when I lived in LA and was a Vegan.  Indian is some of the only food Vegans can actually go out to eat and rest assured that certain dishes won't contain butter, eggs or cream.  If you are Vegan--this is not the restaurant for you.  It did however, have lots of vegetarian options.  Nothing extraordinary--but it was a buffet.  I think typically one must drop a little expectation for the convenience of super fast and simple lunch options.  The naan bread was awesome!!  I found the server quite attentive.  He filled my water probably 4 times in the hour.  I would go back for lunch."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food! I wish my friends liked Indian food so I could go more often!"}
{"text":"Sunday buffet is delicious and well-priced.  Not too spicy--which is great for me, because now I can enjoy the food and not suffer for hours afterwards.  Meat AND vegetarian choices--hooray!  Garlic Naan is delicious.  Service is rapid and pleasant.  Everything tastes SOOO GOOD . . . and I am not a big fan of Indian food.  But I guess I am now!  These folks really deserve a shot at your business!  Comfortable and well-decorated interior.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots. A friend of the family brought us here and we keep coming back. It is so good we are currently waiting 15 minutes for it to open for dinner. The selection of food is awesome and the flavors are exquisite."}
{"text":"Best Indian cuisine around. My wife and I tried this place after discovering another restaurant we liked closed. It was sad we waited so long to try this place. Their food is on point and their service exceptional."}
{"text":"Had the dinner buffet. Was pretty good. I liked the surroundings, lots of great authentic decorations.

The food was alright. Pretty good for my first time having Indian food. The lamb was too salty but the tikka masala was fantastic. I also loved the pudding and custard. The naan and tandoori chicken was also good and complimentary.

Last, the service was amazing! The waiters were all really great and they were constantly refilling our water and making sure our experience was nice."}
{"text":"I've never had Indian food but I've always wanted to try it. So when we heard about the India Oven we just had to try it. At least with a buffet you can pick and choose what you wanted. I agreed with Dawn once we were done! Definitely over stuffed myself. Very awesome place."}
{"text":"Again used the service for delivery. What a complete disaster. Can't say much more.... placed food outside to be picked back up by the restaurant. $39? U judge"}
{"text":"Fantastic buffet with many delicious options. Many vegetarian and meat options. Very reasonably priced. And the staff is always very friendly and service focused. I've been here several times now, and it's always a fantastic experience!!"}
{"text":"They have the Best and cheapest buffet in this part of town served by the best and nicest servers.  It's still a buffet so not everything will blow you away but its all good and filling.  Great way to blow off the Cards when they suck on Sundays.(that's often -I have season tickets, who wants some?)"}
{"text":"This place is so good. We had their dinner buffet (a great deal at $10.95, which includes a mango lassi and garlic naan). We ate there two weeks ago and I'm still thinking about how good it is and can't wait to go back. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"Good buffet with a lot of options! Good pretty very and very authentic. Very quick and always refilling options too. If you're looking for an all you can eat Indian buffet then this is your place! I wish they had a bigger salad bar with more options but besides that it is perfect for everything else! Would go again!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Indian joints in the valley. I love that they have the buffet for both lunch AND dinner, and that they have the buffet divided into vegetarian and non-vegetarian sides. Makes it super easy for people watching their meat intake. Also, if you come for dinner they bring you the tandoori chicken out on a sizzling platter instead of letting it sit on the buffet all night."}
{"text":"Sticky floors, watered down curries and not much of a selection fort the lunch buffet. First and last time here. 

Things to avoid
1. Sambar - mostly water and eggplants
2. Idli - rock hard
3. Butter egg curry - enough said
4. Goat curry - only sauce, no meat

Avoid this place"}
{"text":"Holy crap! I was looking for a good chicken curry and low and behold this is it! Since moving down here from the frigid North, I am constantly on the lookout for the good places to eat.  I found this one on my way home from work.  Soooo good.  The buffet is hot, the curry is hotter and the nann is outstanding! If you have been here, you know what I'm saying. If you haven't been here... Don't wait.  Grab the keys, load up the family and come get some great food!"}
{"text":"India oven is a great place. It was my first time trying Indian food. The only reason I give them a four stars out of five is because I was not a fan of Indian food. It is my own personal fault. I enjoy more clean straight forward tasting food and I kept getting acid reflux after I had it, which is not their fault again. The place is very clean and the service was great."}
{"text":"If you want Indian buffet, this is the best we have found in Phoenix.  Great selection of both vegetarian and meat dishes, fresh Naan bread delivered to your table, and mango lassi self serve."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have eaten here for their buffet once and we loved it and ordered take out one other time. We ordered take out the other day and I noticed it did not come with rice so my boyfriend went in to let them know that they forgot to add the rice in the bag. The told him that they are now charging two dollars for rice so my boyfriend paid the two dollars, which I thought was ridiculous as they know by the fact that we questioned as to why there was not rice (indicating that we ordered there before and got rice for free with our meal). They should have given it to us for free this time as we did not know that it now costs two dollars. They didn't even ask us over the phone if we wanted rice with our meal for an extra two dollars. I don't care about the two dollars. It is just the principle of the matter. Would they rather us pay 10 dollars for a buffet or 30 dollars for takeout? Given that their food is EXCELLENT!, we will be back as it is the only Indian place in the East Valley that has the best food!"}
{"text":"I took my 16 month old son here this weekend while my husband and daughter were seeing a movie together. No one in my family likes ethnic food (and I am Persian!) so its important to me to expose my son to as many types of foods possible while hes still young and open. 

I took him in for the buffet at 5:00 pm on the dot. I wanted to get in early since it is a busy night for restuarants and I didnt know how well he would behave. I got a plate with a little bit of everything on it, as well as a small plastic salad plate (empty) for him to eat off of. In the meantime we got our bread and the wait staff was very helpful making sure I had what I needed for him. They brought a spoon and paper napkins to the table and had taken away the second fork before I had even returned from the buffet. I was impressed.

He played around with the food at first, but really got going towards the end. He really liked the Basmati rice and the lentil stew (I can never remember the names). After that, he decided he really loved the rice with chicken and veggies. He ate and ate and ate. The waiter (owner, maybe?) seemed really happy that he was digging the food. Towards the end, I got my son some watermelon and had to go back to the buffet about 5 times for another piece. I dont like to be wasteful, so we only grabbed a slice at a time.

All in all, the food was great! I am sorry to say, but Arizona has some of the worst Indian food around. I am glad that there is a place I can go to around here, now. The buffet is AWESOME and is so inexpensive. I fully expected to be charged at least for an adult and a child at the buffet (my son eats a lot), but I was pleasantly surprised when I got my bill for $10. It almost made me feel guilty!

I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Such a lovely spot. We were greeted as we came in. It was dinner time and they were pretty busy. After we were seated, we were asked if we wanted the buffet. We decided to try it. Great service. Very, very attentive. Our drinks were never empty and the complimentary bread served at the table was delicious. We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Food and Service are always out of this world. I couldn't say enough good things about this restaurant. I went rouge for the first time ever and ordered off the menu with the help of our amazing server. He was so helpful and friendly and I ordered the tandoori shrimp Marsala and it's legit the best thing I've ever had at an Indian restaurant and one of my top ten dishes in Phoenix. For real. That good. 

My husband raved about the buffet. And our ice chips floating in the Taj Mahal beer showed the quality of service. 

Go here. The reviews all speak for the amazingness of this restaurant! Five stars for sure. I'd give them six if possible."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! I've only tried the chicken briyani and lamb briyani so far, but both are excellent. The spices and flavor were phenomenal! Definitely would recommend if you like something spicier."}
{"text":"India Oven is always awesome. Today was no exception. The Mushroom & Pea Matar was superb. If you are in the area, you must eat here. 
No exceptions"}
{"text":"Not the best place for Indian food.

The Lacha parantha was definitely heated from frozen and topped with a brush of butter, I could sense that in the texture and taste.

Mango lassi was quite watery and a little too tangy for my taste. Lassi should be a little thicker from the fresh yogurt , but hey, some people like thinner consistency.

We started by ordering Bhel Puri, which I'm fairly certain the waiter prepared straight from the buffet, where the ingredients looked like they had been sitting out for some time. Layers had formed on the surface of some curries like the tikka masala, and you could see the oil separating on others - solid sign of untouched food.

The reason I won't give this place one star is for the Karahi Chicken. It was surprisingly flavorful and spiced just enough to make it hot but not burning. The chicken was tender and made for a great dish!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the valley!  Healthy and extremely tasty!!  Can't beat all you can eat for $10 and taste as good as it does!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend, and I are absolutely in LOVE with this place. The food is phenomenal, and not to forget to mention, the service is outstanding! I have gone multiple times and had the same GREAT experience, great food, great service. This is definitely a place to try, or continue to keep going!"}
{"text":"Great time at the buffet. Second time at India oven and just as good as I remember. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is really good! I got the buffet when I went, and I was very pleasantly surprised. It was flavorful and the naan was great. The service was really amazing too, everyone was very nice. The only thing they could improve on is their samosas, I think. Samosas are my favorite, and these were tasty but not the best I've had - and they were too small."}
{"text":"Best Food I've had in a long time! Lots of love in this food. Everything fresh well prepaired.
The staff most considerate and friendly. I would make this a reagular stop if it was in my town."}
{"text":"We went to have the buffet today. My husband LOVES Indian food and we're new to the area. This place had great reviews so we decided to check it out. It was amazing! My husband was really impressed and he's eaten Indian food everywhere in his travels. The buffet was stocked really well with so many choices and the food was all delicious! Having garlic nan brought to you with mango lassi on the buffet was the icing on the cake. We'll definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"As an Indian my review of this place is bad... It's really bad... The 'gulab jambu' was swimming in water, they had no good food the choice of starters and deserts.  I really regret going here."}
{"text":"Awful food. Cold. I came with a group of friends and were wight pissed off. Expensive. Less quantity. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"had buffet lunch today with colleagues from out of town. first timer and we'll be back. very attentive service. above average food selection and quality. mostly authentic. clean rest room. clean dining room. good parking.."}
{"text":"300 reviews can't be wrong.... and they weren't.   This place is fantastic.   Great service and excellent food.  Garlic Naan is so yummy."}
{"text":"Great deal for a dinner buffet. They have all the standard Indian food that Americans are used to, Tiki Masala, Tandori Chicken, Naan bread, curry chicken, and some other good dishes. Love that it offers a dinner buffet as opposed to most places only offering lunch buffet."}
{"text":"It is one of the few restaurants having lunch and dinner buffet. It is good for the first couple of times but becomes monotonous since the dishes do not change. The good thing is we can make our own chat with the chaat ingredients in the buffet."}
{"text":"Always great food at a great price. Very friendly customer service. The best Indian food in the east valley."}
{"text":"Place was in a strip mall, next door to a Chinese buffet. I only tried the daal, which was good. They brought the tandoori chicken to the table, but I didn't try it. All in all, pretty good but I wouldn't make a special trip for it."}
{"text":"Soooo good. Big lunch buffet selection veg & non veg.$9.00 Mango lassi on tap, superior service. Delish!"}
{"text":"I am from NJ where Indian restaurants are in abundance and I'm so happy I came to this place. The dinner buffet has a great variety, everything fresh and tasty, service prompt and friendly. And the price way way lower than in NJ.  I'm rolling out of the restaurant as we speak because I'm so full!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Free tandori chicken, naan, and nice buffet options.  It doesnt get any better than this in AZ!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!!  This was my first time there and went based on the reviews written on Yelp and they did not dissappoint.  We ordered off the menu (though the buffet was very popular) and was not dissapointed. We had Daal and buttered Naan, basmati rice, Vegetable curry, chicken Tikimasala and a wonderful spicy shrimp dish recommended by our server.  And washed it down with a Kingfisher Lager.  Had plenty of take home leftovers for lunch the next day. 

The service  was great and friendly!  Was asked by everyone working how we were and if we needed anything. Will most definately go back again."}
{"text":"Good variety, great price, and unlimited garlic nan. Only place in the valley that gives unlimited free garlic nan everywhere else approximately $3 for four pieces."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places. We are too busy to come as often as we like because it is just a little farther from our house, but when we are here we are always treated so well and the food is wonderful. 
If you are looking for a great buffet and a great price, this is the place. The owners are so great and visit with the customers and just make you feel welcome. 
Thank you for always being amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I've come here with a group of friends every year for the past 7 years and weve never been disappointed. I was really surprised to see an average of three stars. If you like your dishes on the spicy side let them know, overall their food tends to be milder than other indian restaurants in the area. I usually leave having eaten way too much but its so good you just keep eating!"}
{"text":"Yummy~  I am not a fan of many dishes, but they had one I used to cook, I would say their's was so similar that I rate it a 5 it is the Chicken Vandiloo. (spell check)  The nan was good, and hot, the pickles were unique, but I enjoyed them just the same,  they receive a 4 for two minor reasons.

first they didn't bring salad dressing, and salad was 90 percent red onions ( don't get me wrong, I love red onions, I would have preferred more cucumber and less onion, It was fresh, and lovely, so that is 1/2 a star.

the other 1/2 a star I deduct is for the 11.95 price for such  a small portion. (but all in all) it was the perfect size for a meal, but no left overs. I wouldn't mind the amount of chicken if there were more gravy! tiny tiny (but enough to satisfy) no left overs for lunch which is good, because my co workers make fun of my unique taste buds (for an American born person) I mean my fav is Korean food. and they pick on me about the smell of the food, but less than the smell of my breath when I eat it LOL. 
This is pretty close to a 5 , but I just couldn't due to paying 6 extra bucks to have it delivered, and they are around the corner, It was my first try, and I might go back, if in the mood, such a similar dish is at \"Ranch Market, Mexican Market\"  twice the size identical flavors, and half the price."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix AZ with my family.  We really enjoy good Indian cuisine (and are quite picky as there are a lot of bad Indian restaurants). 

I found the Indian Oven via Yelp and we decided to give it a try.  Great food, friendly staff, and exceptional service.

Honestly our service experience was on par with a Ruth Chris or Roys.  Glass never reached half empty, food or wine requests were nearly instant.  The owner then went out of his way to bring our one year old some snacks that were not on the menu.

Highly recommended.  Other restaurants should bring their servers here for a lesson.

Good job Indian Oven!"}
{"text":"I recommend this restaurant to anyone who has never tried Indian food. The buffet is a great way to try different things without breaking the bank. This was my first time and the food was delicious. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Definitely coming back with friends and family."}
{"text":"After being disappointed that the Capriotti's on Sahara was closed, I walked around and came across this restaurant. When I first saw the store front, it listed that they had a dinner buffet from 5pm to 10pm - woo-hoo! But when I walked in, it turns out that they didn't have a buffet for dinner (at least for the night I came in - minus one star for false advertising!).

It's okay though, because I ended up ordering the Vegetarian Thali, which is almost like a mini buffet in itself - Palak Paneer, Channa Masala, Rice, Pakora, Naan... And Kheer! It was all very good! I especially liked the Channa Masala.

The interior of the restaurant was clean and well lit. Service was attentive - I always had a full glass of water."}
{"text":"I am so confused where all these bad reviews come from! My husband and I love love love the food at India Oven, the service is superb, and the price is so reasonable! One of our favorite places when we are feeling lazy for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"My whole family is full of adventurous eaters. I met with my son and his wife and my two girls on Tuesday for buffet at Indian Oven. Wow, the food was fabulous and showed a great variety of meats and vegetarian dishes. The hosts were attentive and frequently returned with delicious hot Nan bread and fresh water. Mango juice and hot chai tea came with the meal and for the price, it was a great deal! We will be returning soon and the sooner the better as far as I'm concerned!"}
{"text":"Probably my second favorite Indian buffet in the valley.  The price is right. The garlic naan is great.  The owners are very nice.  The food is fresh and there's a very good variety, and mango lassi is available as part of the buffet. So good."}
{"text":"We came here because we saw the high rating on yelp. It's a decent place, not bad, not great. I would say the best thing about the place was the naan that they served with the meal. The service was extremely efficient, if impersonal. 
They would deposit the naan (or water or check) very efficiently, and then take off quickly.
With regards to the food, there is certainly quantity at the buffet. There was a variety of vegetarian and nonvegetarian dishes as well as desserts. I was excited that they had mango lassi (not the best I've had, but not bad).
We had the buffet and found the food overall a bit on the bland side. They may need to go less spicy on the buffet to have a wider appeal. The restaurant didn't have the great ambiance and felt in need of a bit of updating. 
What they lack in quality of the buffet food (again, I only had the buffet) and atmosphere here, I suppose they make up for in quantity of buffet items. The price was pretty decent, too. Perhaps ordering off the menu would be a different experience. I would give around a 2-3 stars for a decent experience and especially decent prices."}
{"text":"Great food! Great value!  Staff is also extremely nice. The only downside is the location.  Lock your car door and hide your valuables."}
{"text":"YUUUMMM-O!!! 
This place is the best in the east valley for Indian food with great flavor and at a great value too! Tikka Masala, Curries, Mango Lassi, and delicious fresh NAAN!! A girl's best friend! :) hahahahaa... this place is great, def not a date place but great casual dining... typical mom/pop setup in a strip-mall but most of AZ is like that anyways. The food is so good you won't care. Just don't dress up! Be cozy and enjoy the yummy-ness and go home and sleep. This is the food that you wanna eat on a day off when you want to relax and feel homey! :)"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. I've only been three times but I can confidently say this place 1ups ALL of the Indian restaurants in Vegas. It is quality cooked Punjabi food. It is as good as my Mom's cooking (and that says a lot haha). The Aunty and Uncle that own this restaurant are so humble and accommodating, they always make me feel as though I'm at home (even though I only know them through the restaurant). I would really recommend to go for the brunch/lunch buffet. There are soo many selections, vegetarian and non-veg. The food is fresh, the pakoras and samosas are always hot and crunchy! Additionally, they have complimentary mango lassi, along with at least two Indian dessert options, and fresh fruit! [I'm getting hungry writing about this place, haa.] When family comes to visit and they are want to go out to eat, this restaurant is going to be the go-to spot! :D"}
{"text":"Really tasty Indian food, buffet style. Lots of selections. Wonderful seasonings. You'd expect the chunks of meat to possibly be chewy but they weren't. The rice was a bit dry for me, but it's probably correct, for their style of cooking. They have a dispenser full of mango lassi, that I could have been happy to have taken with me! Oh so yummy! I still dream of the chicken tandoori. Yep, there will be a return trip in our future."}
{"text":"This Review is for Buffet Only!
India Oven is one of the few restaurants that serves Buffet for both Lunch and Dinner.
The Lunch buffet is around $10 and the dinner buffet is $12.

They have an assortment of chats,samosa and pakoras with various chutneys.
For Mains Butter Chicken,Goat/lamb curry,tandoori chicken,chicken biriyani and other vegetarian dishes like Dal makhani,paneer gravy,aloo, palak etc.

The Desert section has Gulab jamun, custard,rice kheer,cut fruits,jalebi.
The Naan is brought fresh to the table (you can choose plain/butter/garlic).
I love that the buffet also includes tea and Mango lassi.
The staff is friendly and service is good.

I wouldn't recommend ordering from the menu(You will ending up paying much more for dishes that are just average).Go for the Buffet, while all the dishes may not be to your liking and taste you will definitely find a favorite that will make it worth your while."}
{"text":"Good place to dry for lunch and dinner buffet. You just can't miss chicken tikka and tandoori chicken :)"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like the most luxurious place but the food is really tasty. Really good tikka masala! The garlic naan was really good also. Taj Mahal beer was really good as well."}
{"text":"Stellar!!! Delicious chicken teek', naan bread was warm and soft, washed it down with a Taj lager.... Will be a regular from here on out!!"}
{"text":"Brief summary- This place has great service, authentic appetizing food, great decor and it is an amazing value!

I was feeling in the mood for Indian and I have been at this shopping plaza many times but not while India Oven was open.  I usually come very early in the morning to a 24 hour restaurant nearby but I've seen their sign for a lunch buffet.  

The Buffet looked small at first but it was filling and had all the dishes I've come to know and love at other Indian places.  The flavors of the curries were spicy but very good.  Each one was a different treat. The server came around frequently and my Diet Coke was never empty long.  The best surprise was the bill.  It was cheap!  The decor and the tables are made up like a fine restaurant, and the food definitely delivers.  If you are awake during the day (I usually am not, sadly) from 11-2:30 you should try this place!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food in the east Valley. Period. We come at least once a month for the buffet. The food is seriously delicious. The people who work there are sooo nice and helpful. Mesa is in general not a restaurant hot spot but India Oven is the best!"}
{"text":"Terrible Indian food. I'm Indian, so by my standards, this place is terrible.

First, the selection is very skewed. Only chicken? The owner's religious preference is pretty apparent here, and mine probably is too, but c'mon, can I get some beef? I'll be honest though, the chicken dishes that were there were pretty decent. naan is good, and they actually have some good dessert available for their buffet. the food isn't that bad. mango lassi is decent as well, but it wasn't cold, and that was a big turn off. 

if there is one dish that exemplifies indian food it is the tandoori chicken. this place failed with that dish. ok, you can bring it to me on a sizzling plate, that's cool and all, but it better be tasty. the tandoori wasn't spicy and it was VERY lemony. huge turn off. tandoori has a distinct flavor that can be ruined by too much lemon. i thought this was a one time thing, so i ordered another...

FAIL. owner who was taking our order said we couldn't order more than 1 round of chicken. hmm...i thought i came for the buffet? this was a HUGE fail. sorry, but if you aren't going to give me unlimited tandoori chicken, don't call this a buffet. \"we usually don't do reorders on tandoori chicken for buffet, but i will let you this time\". what kind of service is that?

the servers are kind and nice, naan is brought out fairly promptly.

all in all, this place has some huge flaws that give it the 1 star rating. first off, i've never been to an indian food place that didn't have all you can eat tandoori chicken. i just can't stress this enough, i was SO shocked when i heard this. then, the way the owner told me really turned me off. second, the mango lassi wasn't cold. if you're mango lassi isn't cold, its like getting a warm milk shake or a warm smoothie. third, the all chicken dishes really isn't very appealing. some beef qorma or something would be a great addition. there is much better stuff in phoenix, keep looking, stay away."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best deal for Indian food, plus the buffet is open for both lunch and dinner (Usually you only find Indian buffet open for lunch).  While lunch buffet is $7.99, for 2 dollars more you can go there for dinner buffet which has a large variety of meat dishes, vegetarian dishes, desserts, and includes chai tea and mango lassi in your order.  In addition, they will make fresh tandoori chicken and bring freshly baked naan to your table.  All the buffet items were delicious, although some of the chicken dishes tended to taste a little too similar to each other.  The owner is very friendly and wants to make every effort to make sure you are having the best experience at her restaurant.  If I am ever in the mood for Indian food for dinner, this is the place I will be heading."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet for 10.95. It was ok meal. Nothing special. Naan was yummy and fresh, the rice not so much . I liked the goat curry from buffet"}
{"text":"This is good a place as it gets close to the strip. The best is the lunch buffet. The evening experience is average.

The food quality is very good. The owner is mostly there and a very friendly person."}
{"text":"I normally would not eat a buffet but this place is good. We have been going there for a few years now and is consistently good."}
{"text":"Great dinner buffet--everything was very tasty and the service was great.  The chicken tikka masala was amazing and the free garlic naan was delicious.   Will come back again someday."}
{"text":"I'm usually hesitant to go to buffets because the food typically is mediocre in quality. India Oven is excellent for both lunch and dinner. The buffet has a large variety of vegetarian and meat dishes along with good desserts such as carrot pudding and gulab jamun. 

I've tried all of the offerings in the buffet, and they were all delicious. Their garlic naan is delicious and comes out piping hot. The service is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Stopped in to India Oven for some take out and ordered the non-vegeterian Thalí, essentially, a sampler plate. I'm not really sure what it consisted of, but I can tell you it was delicious!  There was a chicken dish, a shrimp one, and beef...or maybe lamb? All three were great - the shrimp was excellent! 

We also ordered some meat samosas...those were not my favorite.  I'm a samosa fan, but these just didn't do it for me.  It was really just a deep fried pocket of finely ground meat...the samosas I've had in the past were pastry thin dough, wrapped several times around the fillings, so that the dough was a bit flaky.  These had a single wrapping of a thicker dough.  I dunno...not my thing.  Aside from that, great dinner. I'll be back for sure.

Oh - redeeming the samosas was this delicious minty green dipping sauce.  Yum."}
{"text":"I visited the restaurant at 6 in the evening. There were good number of people.

We initially planned to pick up food, but looking at the ambience we decided to dine in.

The food was good. Service was excellent. We had ordered 2 curries which had the same ingredients. The manager was kind enough to let us know that both would taste the same. So we changed one of the curries.

The staff is very courteous. This is the best part about this place.

I would recommend this place to everyone.

Price is decent. $25 per person average."}
{"text":"India Oven Rocks! 

My husband and I went for dinner on a Friday night, and it was packed! There were several Indian families there, which I took as a good sign. We were initially seated next to a party of about 30 people, but the hostess quickly offered us a booth, so we could have \"better conversation\". I thought that was very considerate. The staff was attentive and took good care of us. 

We had the buffet, which is such a great deal! It includes naan, mango lassi, and a variety of chicken, lamb and vegetarian dishes. We only paid about $21, and the food was delicious! 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service as always. We've been coming here since they opened in 2008, never disappointed!! Thank you Jitu and Aku."}
{"text":"Excellent? A wonderful and delightful, flavorful, fresh experience? A must go to place! Buffet is excellent too. Please try this one if you like Indian influenced or authentic Indian flare foods. Absolutely no regrets"}
{"text":"I love this place. I first visited for my birthday in 2011 never having experienced Indian cuisine. I was slightly worried about the amount of spices and heat but everything was great. My favorites are Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Vindaloo, Tandoori Chicken, and the Basil Mint Chicken Curry. The price is unbelievable with the varieties of food to choose from and the included Garlic Naan and Tandoori Chicken. Our last visit was 9/20/2013 and they had these delicious little coconut burfi pieces. So good- you might not be a coconut fan but trust me, these could change your mind quickly. My husband and I both ate a countless amount. If I lived closer, I am sure I would visit at least weekly. Great food, wonderful service, excellent price!"}
{"text":"Oh wow..Where to begin?!

This place is AWESOME. It's super affordable ($10 lunch buffet) with the most satisfying food. You get a nice variety of both vegetarian and non vegetarian options, as well as salad and dessert. The food isn't too salty or overbearing..Just the right amount of flavor! Oh and their freshly baked naan is out of this world.

The servers here are so sweet and are constantly making sure you have everything you need. More garlic naan? No problem! More water? Straight away! Everyone here has such a great attitude and it just makes me want to come back and keep supporting this business. 

I've been to some of the other Indian buffets around here (y'all know the one!) And while they are not bad, India Oven truly takes the experience and quality to another level. I am happy to have discovered this place and I hope you guys can experience it too!"}
{"text":"Great staff and great food. I went here with my wife because we wanted to go get something different than usual. We got the buffet and it was delicious they offer tons of different dishes that are constantly changed for freshness. Also a cheap place to go when your really hungry."}
{"text":"It might be a good \"deal\", but the quality of this food is very low. The chicken tikka masala was difficult to eat. The pieces of chicken were gross and not cleaned at all. A lot of veins, fat, and unwanted pieces. The place also could stand to be cleaner. I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I'm not usually a fan of a buffet, but I'm glad I made an exception at India Oven. There was a large selection of meat and veggie dishes, delicious mango lassi, chai tea, dessert items and fresh nan brought to the table along with tandoori chicken legs. I'm not in AZ often, but we'll visit India Oven again when we get back."}
{"text":"We went for Valentines day and they were very busy, and trying to make sure everyone was happy. For a very busy night, service was pretty good. The food is what matters most, and it was good too (we had the buffet). The best was the Chicken Tikki Masala and Lamb Vindaloo, in addition to the Pakoras. There was some other chicken dish that was good but I forget the name, I hadn't heard of it before. It was in more of a broth vs. a creamy sauce. There were some vegetarian options but not tons. Samosas and naan weren't the best I've had, but not bad. I'd like to go again."}
{"text":"Good Indian restaurant, haven't found a better local one yet, but not as good as some I've tried elsewhere. Buffet is good and takeout is good too. No complaints."}
{"text":"Free flow of garlic naan and mango lassi with the buffet. I rest my case. Seriously though, those two items alone won me over but of all the Indian buffets I've been to, and I've been to a few, they serve up the most variety, catering to both vegetarians and carnivores. Of course, they serve up some pretty awesome desserts (I call them donut holes soaked in syrup, but I'm sure it has a name).

Having been to other buffets which advertise having a free flow of naan, I was a little skeptical when I read this on their website. It's like going to Chompie's on St. Patty's Day and ordering their unlimited corned beef dish - after one dish, your waitress disappears. Let me make this clear, not here. At the India Oven, they are on top of it. Are you out of garlic naan? Never fear, that garlic naan is coming right your way. And you definitely want that second or third round of garlic naan. Never mind the garlic breath, it's so worth it.

At the buffet table, I honestly much prefer the meat dishes. You can easily find large pieces of lamb or chicken in the curry and get more than your fair share of protein. What bugs me (minor as this is) is that the basmati rice is in the middle of the buffet table. I'm a little OCD about my rice being on the bottom of my plate and having it drown in curry so I had to cut a couple people off and backtrack to the start of the buffet table to load up on the curry. Just a little pet peeve but heck, it didn't make my food taste any less amazing. They had tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, a chicken curry, and I believe two types of lamb curries which I thoroughly enjoyed. I even fancied the lentils over in the vegetarian section - look at me, eating vegetables and stuff.

Desserts - I've never seen this many desserts at an Indian buffet. At other buffets, you would have 2-3 desserts to choose from but if memory serves, India Oven gives you a choice of 4+ desserts. Of course I had to have them all, never mind the food coma that was about to hit. - there's always room for dessert. Besides, there's some Indian tea to wash it all down. I might explode, but I'll take my chances."}
{"text":"Super good food and staff it's extremely friendly. Love coming here every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Meh...lunch buffet was underwhelming, ambience was nonexistent. Kudos to the waitstaff for attentiveness and for trying, but promising certain food items (how can you run out of kabobs when you're a major player in the Indian buffet market!) and not delivering (thanks to the conversation my groups stayed the whole time) gets you blacklisted. Better to offer alternatives than to keep the packed house waiting on the specialty. Also pricey for the few options offered. I could have gone to Samosa Factory instead and loaded up. Not coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Outstanding value and always delicious. The free lassi, chai, naan, and sizzling tandoori chicken served with dinner make this place a more comprehensive meal than most Indian Buffets, though they come with no added cost. My wife and I have been here many times, and while the food is consistently flavorful at a good price, it's not so special as to earn a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"I was greeted immediately upon entering I told them I wanted to do takeout.  Most places make you wait at the bar but they offered me a seat at a table. I ordered from the menu and my order was ready in  about 15 minutes. The chicken tikka masala is yummy, I love to mix it with the rice and eat with the garlic Naan, the roti it delicious too.  This time I also tried the shrimp curry, it was okay, my favorite is still the chicken tikka masala!"}
{"text":"The best buffet I have ever seen. The owners introduced themselves and everyone was extremely friendly. The food was hot and fresh and there was a huge selection."}
{"text":"Best buffet in phoenix suburban area.
Rare dinner buffet option is added plus. Good for a casual night out."}
{"text":"Visited August 2015:  \"Buffet for Lunch AND Dinner\"

This is one of my favorite places to go for Indian cuisine. I have come to this establishment on my own several times, come with family a few times, and I have brought friends/co-workers on multiple occasions that several of them have become regular patrons on their own. The staff is very friendly, accommodating, and eager to assist with your eating experience. They come around each table several times refilling your water, asking if you'd like another beverage, and bringing fresh Nann to the table. Sometimes they also bring tandoori chicken if it is not on the buffet. They have vegetarian dishes, chicken dishes, and lamb dishes to choose from. All the dishes are marked and the vegetarian dishes are separated. They have assorted snacks, a salad, some chutneys, and dessert choices too. There is a mango lassi dispenser at the buffet area. Lunch buffet is under $15 if you get an ice tea or soda. Dinner buffet is under $20 with the same conditions. There is decor around the restaurant, but most of it is up on a ledge out of normal view. They have a very large plasma TV playing Bollywood movies, and Indian music in the background. The only criticizes I have are: the buffet area needs to be larger because it can get very cramped around there especially if you are trying to eat at a nearby table/booth. Another is using the restroom. You have to get past the small pub where all the waiters go to get the alcohol drinks, ring up checks, and people are getting their take out weighted and paid. You have to squeeze through this traffic, along with a cooler that holds the glasses."}
{"text":"My family and I went to their lunch buffet on a saturday. The place is well kept & clean. The service was wonderful, the servers were very attentive and friendly. Food was delicious, spicy and flavorful. Although, I wish they have spicyness rating above each dish, so you know ahead instead of getting surprised by their level of spicyness. They have a pretty good selections of curry. Their mango lassi is so good! Everything was great except that our naan bread took a L-O-N-G time to come out and when they finally came, they were burnt, which was a huge disappointment to everyone since we were all looking forward to eating their delicious garlic naan! This is why they are not getting 5-star from me. Other than that, I will definitely go back again because the place is clean, service is good and food is authentic and delicious! Hopefully, we will not have to wait a long time for their naan bread and be served burnt naan bread again next time."}
{"text":"If you like authentic Indian food this is the restaurant to visit. They have a buffet line that is outstanding and the price point is perfect. Their service is great and the food is delicious, try it as soon as you can."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by to have dinner last night and OMG! the food and service was DELICIOUS! It was a late dinner so wasn't until 9 that we dropped in, but I'll tell you this...the food in the buffet was still fresh and great! They even brought us out from fresh chicken masala off the grill with some nice sauteed onions! 

Gotta try it out if you haven't done so already! and if you have been there -see you there!"}
{"text":"Buffet selection limited, but the dishes offered were delicious. I'm picky about the buffets I go to but everything here was fresh, naan provided. Meat and vegetarian options available (veggie options delicious)"}
{"text":"Do you like food comas? 
Do you believe that there's a buffet on this planet where EACH AND EVERY ITEM is perfect, delicious, and has the same quality and amazement as an entree you'd order off of a menu? If you believe, then you're in for a treat - India Oven is truly that place; the very first buffet I've ever been to in which none of the food served tasted like... it was from a buffet. Everything is awesome. The service is impeccable, and they constantly throw the best garlic naan on earth at you. This is why I'm fat, and I'm so proud to be!"}
{"text":"The food here was really good and the staff was very friendly.  We were the only ones in the restaurant with a screaming baby and the owner came over to talk and he was very understanding and nice.  I will go back."}
{"text":"This buffet was to DIE for. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food was OK, but not worth how expensive it was(went there for dinner).  I tried asking the waiter what the popular menu items were, but he wasn't very helpful.  It's the sort of place where you have to research the menu items beforehand if you want a more pleasant experience.

The atmosphere for dinner is very qiet and romantic, the dine in itself looks quite nice.  I wouldn't recommend going for dinner, it's much better to go for lunch, cheaper too."}
{"text":"This place is great! Although, I prefer the entrees at Mynt Indian Bistro... I absolutely loved the Tea, appetizers and soup. I would completely love to go back for a second time. I do feel like the entrees are a little pricey for the size, but I can tell they use quality ingredients."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. It's the type of food that once you taste it, you will crave at the most random times. There really is nothing bad on the menu (haven't tried the desserts or appetizers though I sure they are great). What brings the rating down one star is the younger girl who works evenings. She doesn't crack a smile and makes it apparent she'd rather be doing a million other things. The rest of the staff though is nice and very approachable."}
{"text":"Tried Indian Food for the 1st time last night and this place was AMAAAZZZZING!  I am a very picky eater and I went back for at least 2 plates.  Everything was fresh, hot and delish.  I would recommend this place to anyone. And the Buffet was very good.  For 10 bucks, you can't beat the price, the food and the great service!"}
{"text":"Came at 10:35 PM for food pick up, people were eating in restaurant and we requested owner to let us eat inside and he said no you can not eat inside with I mean come on men grow up.. we paid $60 for food and not allowing us to eat."}
{"text":"so we have a choice of mc donald amd india oven...so we tried going indian food...this is the worst indian restaurant in las vegas( maybe the whole US)..the food was dirty,dry and taste awful...its a shame its in the strip...for 11 bucks each..i could have been happy to eat a bigmac!!! Ive never been disgusted in a place like this...the 5.99 chinese buffet are more decent ...ill never eat here again in my lifetime!! I feel robbed!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite!!!! I would go here for my birthday dinner. We take all our friends here. BEST INDIAN FOOD EVER! I love you chicken tiki masala. And your buffet style serving. Mango lassi, yes please. 

HUGE fan!

Great price. Fantastic service, even when super busy. Always keep my water filled. (Huge fan of that!) fresh nan bread. 

I love this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst indian restaurants around. They use cheap quality ingredients. The lamb is actually Beef. Most indian restaurants do that to save money. The food is completely bland. Go to India's Grill for real Indian food. Ive been to all of the valley Indian restaurants, and they are the best."}
{"text":"When I want a hearty, Indian meal, I choose India Oven. This place has food and service down to a science. There are some mainstays and plenty of rotating dishes to keep a foodie satisfied. Every time I have visited, I leave wondering how they are able to pack so much flavor into every bite. You know it is a good meal when you contemplate it afterwards! Oh, and did I mention that they have a full bar for mixed drinks? Huge plus!

India Oven proprietors are gracious, attentive, and helpful. Whether you are dining alone or with a large group of friends, they always make sure you have what you need. 

I see no reason to go anywhere else when I crave the tastes of India :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here several times and keep returning for more. The food is soo amazing.i did not like this type of food , until I ate here. Now I can not wait to return for more. I think I have entered culinary nervana . Great food, great service at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic indian restaurant. The place was clean and the people were very friendly. One indication that a ethic restaurant is truly worth the money is seeing their own countrymen eating there. For example seeing Chinese people eating in a Chinese restaurant and just the locals. This tells you that the food is actually authentically and prepared according to traditional standards. The tandoori chicken was moist and tender, and spiced proper. The lamb was a bit salty but it wasn't bad for a buffet line. The chicken biryani was also a great choice they offered."}
{"text":"The food was really good. Flavorful and good service. Why not more stars? The reviews in the newspaper from the board of health. Apparently there are some issues with cleanliness. I really do hope that these get resolved as the food was great for a buffet. The nann was excellent. I really like the lamb vindaloo as well. There were some interesting desserts that I don't know what they were but they were great! Chai tea comes with the buffet and that was a nice treat as well. There was a short wait for a table when we were there but when a table opened they got it turned over very fast and got us drinks right out and were very nice."}
{"text":"I love love this place!!!!!  Incredible Curry and great service.  They bring fresh Hot Nan Bread to your table.  Looks can be deceiving. I highly recommend you visit this place and experience a fantastic Lunch Buffet!"}
{"text":"So, you can never go wrong at Indian oven.  The food is  delicious and great hospitality.  I love every thing they had today."}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch here today. Service was very attentive. The Buffett had a lot of options the saag paneer and chicken tikka masala was very good. Price was great for lunch. I will be back again"}
{"text":"Worst place to eat, arrogant stuff even do know how to talk, strongly not recommended."}
{"text":"Consistently good and predictable offerings. Can't go wrong if you are here with a group with diverse tastes and preferences. Their buffets offer something for everyone."}
{"text":"Can't get anymore delicious than this! Get the buffet. You will find my words wise. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I fill in at an office near by here from time to time, and every night when I go home delicious aromas waft from their building to my nose, making me instantly hungry and causing me to break every speed limit to get home and have some dinner. Today was finally my day to try them out for lunch. I only ordered the veggie korma and a garlic naan to go, and the gentleman working there threw in some of those soggy dough nut dessert thingies, which was very sweet. Everyone was nice, my order was done on time, and the food was exactly what I had hoped for. My spice level for today was medium, which was good, but I think I'll go all the way next time. The buffet also looked great, maybe I'll go that route next week."}
{"text":"Was here yesterday for the first time.  Visiting from DC...so I know authentic Indian food.  

Service was incredible so two thumbs up...I had the Buffett so it was good but can't say it was amazing.  Tandoori chicken was excellent, the Pakora, spinach, chicken biryani, and spinach were okay.  Lamb stew was also very good...so not a five star Buffett but not too bad for this area...in reality, this is an Indian-Punjabi place so if you know India or are from there, you will understand my point.  But this doesn't make a difference, the flavors are Punjabi especially when you taste the vegetarian dishes.  All good...the garlic bread was amazing!"}
{"text":"One night I was suddenly craving for some garlic naan.  We came across this place and decided to try out the buffet.  It went beyond my expectations, very authentic.  The price is really good too for all the food you can get.  The garlic naan was so yummy! Recommended place for indian buffet.  Price is right and food is awesome!"}
{"text":"$9, all you can eat.

No, that's not just the lunch special, that's the buffet price all day long.  We're talking fantastic, authentic Indian food here.  Great variety of taste, lots of vegetarian options, tasty naan, and friendly service top off the experience at India Oven.

Nothing more to say--a long, detailed review isn't necessary here. Just try it for yourself and enjoy!"}
{"text":"AMAZING Buffet. Super Friendly Staff. The flavors from this food are absolutely incredible. I would recommend this place to anybody looking to eat delicious Indian food."}
{"text":"Found this place randomly! Good curry places seem to be hard to come across, this place has a great buffet menu with food that's perfectly seasoned and delicious. Price is very reasonable and the staff is always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I've been to places that cost 10 times as much with worse service. Delicious naan, amazing food at the buffet, free mango lassis?! I just wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Haven't had Indian food in a while but the buffet is legit

Buffet is well stocked with around 15 items and they have hot tea and mango lhassi on the side. Buffet is split into three parts of Non-Veggie, Vegetarian, and Random. (I think it says something else but I categorized this as random in my head)

Solid lunch buffet in the area all for around $11 including tip

*Also had like 10 pieces of Naan ~ nyam nyam"}
{"text":"My new favorite Indian buffet.  The chicken tikka masala was the best I've had since working in Silicon Valley.  The lamb vindaloo could have used more heat, but the lamb was nice and tender.  The saag paneer was the best I've ever had.  Tasted fresh and it had a little kick.  That's a very welcome first.  The garlic naan had the whole table raving.  Very good food and the price can't be beat."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food! The buffet is an amazing deal. It comes with so much delicious food! I've never been to a better Indian buffet. Wish I lived in Phoenix so that I could eat here again!"}
{"text":"WOW! I am a big fan of this place. The friendly staff is always attentive. The food is great, probably the best buffet style Indian food I have ever eaten. The price is right. All combined make this a place I am sure to frequent."}
{"text":"I've recommended this place to friends several times.
First, being an Indian buffet, the atmosphere is unique and great.  There's a plenty of traditional dishes and being a buffet, you can try as many as you dare.  The decor is also good, with some nice booth seating, chandeliers, and a modern black-ceiling look.  It seems very authentically Indian, with mostly native Indian servers (one was even a turban-wearing Muslim) and Bollywood playing on their TV. There are a few reminders though that this is just a $10 per meal place though, like the cheesy Indian paintings and one or two handwritten signs over newer dishes.
I thought the food was good, but possibly a little heavy on the spices for my taste.  Other than that it was delicious.
The price may not be better than some nearby places if you're looking for lots of tasty food, but at only $10 dollars, I can't complain too much.
The service was fantastic!  They made me feel like I was the only one in the place.  Both my server and the owner stopped by to check in on me several times during my stay."}
{"text":"Good price, but I was pretty disappointed in the flavor or lack there of in their buffet options. Their naan was good though. Maybe their a la carte options are better."}
{"text":"We usually make a trip here at least once a month. Never fails to send us home full and happy. Wonderful service and the food is sensational. It's a hidden gem, and easy on the wallet.

Update 5/2017 - i stand by the above review, and would like to add that out of the 20 something states I've traveled to, this is hands down, my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"10 dollar dinner buffet. It was a pretty decent buffet and the food tasted really great. There wasn't anything that I didn't like and a few dishes that were binge eating worthy. I like the tandoori and the chicken curry. The staff was friendly too and very Attentive. Never an empty glass of water and every few minutes, someone walks around offering more and more naan!"}
{"text":"Small place with big taste. Great choices on the buffet. Lots of vegetarian options. Should have tried this place long ago!"}
{"text":"Super friendly, easy parking, tasty food, and reasonable prices.  What more can you ask for?

Had the Lamb Sheesh Kabob and Chana Masala (chick peas in tomato sauce).  Both dishes were super tasty.  

This place is an easy walk from the SLS hotel, and for anyone with a car easy to get to off Sahara."}
{"text":"We called 30 mins in advance for a group of 17 and they made it work.
Super service.
Great food.
Very good authentic quality with a good variety.

I'm a British curry monster and I was very happy.

What else can I say?

Thoroughly recommended."}
{"text":"super value, great food. Great to be able to do the buffet dinner in the evenings. This has become our new go to Indian Restaurant even though it's a bit of a hike from Tempe over to Gilbert Drive in Mesa.

Friendly service, very consistent food. The layout is a little drab - It looks like they took over some older style western restaurant, but who cares about that - friendly service, a good variety of tasty dishes, great price.  The kolfi is highly addictive. Menu is great for Vegetarian like me."}
{"text":"Since my first review months ago, this place has become our weekly go-to Indian buffet! This is seriously the best Indian that I've had in the Phoenix area. Like I said in my first review, their unlimited garlic naan is amazing and they have a wonderful, clean, nice atmosphere which is not always the case for Indian restaurants. The service is IMPECCABLE. The servers are all extremely attentive and super nice. Once, I even forgot my bag in the booth and they ran out to our car and gave it to me so I wouldn't forget. 

We go here about once a week because it is also so affordable. $9 for lunch or $13 for dinner, and it's all you can eat! I normally get chicken tikka masala (my favorite) and a vegetable dish. Their lamb vindaloo is also very good and my boyfriend loves their tandoori chicken. We also normally end out our meal with mango lassi. This place can get busy & we've found that our favorite time to go is right when they open at 5 and everything is fresh! I'm in Hawai'i right now and can't wait to get back to Arizona to get my weekly dose of India Oven!"}
{"text":"As my first dinner in Mesa - I looked to Yelp and found my answer. With my usual enormous dinner appetite I decided that a well-regarded Indian buffet was right up my alley.

  I showed up around 7pm and was instantly seated at a dimly-lit, partitioned-off two-seater (note: good option for a date). It became immediately apparent how attentive the staff was when I was served a complimentary piece of sizzling chicken tandoori (placed on a bed of cabbage and sautéed peppers/onions), followed by some freshly made garlic naan as I sat down with my buffet starter plate of samosa, vege fritters, sweet cheese balls and some accompanying sweet/spicy sauces.

  A little about the spread: They have a nice variety of savory chicken, lamb, goat and even egg dishes. A tasty chicken biryani, or an optional bismati rice right out of the steamer go great with any of the creamy masalas/currys. There are some vegetarian dishes as well, and they have bottomless mango lassi and creamy tea available to wash it all down.

  I tried almost everything they offered and enjoyed it all - up to the point where I could barely manage to grunt when offered service by the ever-so-attentive waitstaff. But I had my mind fixated on one item I saw up there.. I had to go on..

  I took a final, small plate and loaded up two scoops of their mango custard. Woooww.. In my food-borne inebriation my eyelids sagged whenever this godlike concoction hit my tastebuds. Insulting my already overstuffed stomach with a final, unneccessary swig of their delicious tea I was walking out with a large grin on my face - knowing that I have already found a keeper on my first night out :)"}
{"text":"My first time here & my first time trying Indian food. Went with a friend who knows her way around the food so I am basing this on her notes. She said it was way better than her usual go to place & she will be coming back.  Everything I tried was delicious, the Chicken Tikka Masala & the Tandoori Chicken were heavenly.  Staff was friendly, made sure our water glasses stayed full & answered all my silly questions. Will be back there soon."}
{"text":"The food here has never disappointed me.
The service is excellent, they adjust the level of spice to your liking, and the food is worth the price.
The naan is especially good and the papadum is good.
My favorite dish is the lamb vindalu, but the saag paneer and the basmati are also very good.
The dishes are small, but it's the same way in all the other Indian restaurants.
The atmosphere is a little upscale (white table cloths, nice flatware and silverware) and the lighting is on the dark side, which I like.
All-in-all a very nice Indian experience.
I saw a buffet table, but they said that it was for lunch.
I'll have to go back and try that out."}
{"text":"Love the buffet!  Lots of great options at a very fair price.  The mango smoothie included is very good too."}
{"text":"The food was great, the wait staff was constantly coming around to see if you needed anything, it was clean... Just make sure to be ok to wait in line because the place can get busy :)"}
{"text":"Oh buffets, why must you tempt me so? Delicious food here at India Oven, and wonderful service! If you are looking for a wide array of authentic food, this is the place to go.

We came for a dinner buffet on a Sunday evening. It wasn't busy at all, and for $10 a person, we couldn't pass it up. We were greeted warmly and seated quickly. The restaurant has a lot of Indian decor, there is a TV on one of the walls, and a full bar on the left side with authentic Indian beers.

After we got our first plate of buffet food and sat down, we were brought a freshly made Tandoori Chicken! Sizzling hot, the chicken and beef were aromatic and tasty. The garlic naan served at the table was fresh out of the oven, steaming, and had just the right amount of garlic flavor.

Everything on the buffet was wonderful. We had to try a little bit of everything, but were are sure glad we did. The buffet was separated into non-vegetarian, vegetarian, and salad/dessert. The meat section had lamb, goat, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, and three different rices. The vegetarian section had lentil soup, aloo gobi (cauliflower with potatoes), two tofu dishes, and a couple others I don't remember.

There was a salad bar with salsas, dressings, and watermelon (yum!). Next to the salad bar were also vegetable samosas (warm, crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and terrifically spiced), and vegetable fritters. The desserts included fried cheese balls with light syrup, rice pudding, and a small nut/almond based cookie.

They also had a few drinks available on the edge of the buffet. Bottom line is you get way more than for bargained for, especially for a $10 dinner. Service is top notch, and we will definitely come again and pick some of our favorites."}
{"text":"Great Indian food buffet. Was very affordable- 1 adult & 2 kids was $21. Had a great selection of vegetarian foods and everything was mildly spicy and delicious. Lots of choices & everyone working there was super friendly. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian place in town! Everybody there is very friendly and helpful.

The food is also great, they have everything from a salad to lamb vindaloo. The garlic naan there is the best, but if you aren't a garlic person just ask and they'll bring you plain. For desert they have rice pudding, mango pudding, last but not least warm cheese balls. 

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking for an Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"I don't usually give 5 stars because there's almost always room for improvement. Not so much here. The food is spectacular. The lunch buffet is the ticket if you can't pick a favorite. Some dishes are spiced for heat but all are flavorful in such a way that you can pick out individual spices. I don't know how they do it! They have as many vegetarian dishes as meat offerings,and they have no less flavor. There's chai and mango lasse included in the buffet price but they also have a bar. The dark wood paneling provides a cozy and comfortable atmosphere. The staff is attentive but not overbearing. Great place all around."}
{"text":"Overpriced and the food is just OK.... Much prefer Mt. Everest Indian Cuisine further west on Sahara"}
{"text":"Oh. Ma. Gosh.  Unbelievable food and a fantastic price.  This is hands down one of our new favorite place in the valley.  The service was stellar, friendly and attentive and quick as a wink in keeping our water glasses full.  

My favorite was the Chicken Masala - just the right amount of zip meets creamy.  The Mango Lassi was heaven in a glass.  We tried a spoonful of everything just to sample - talk about a party in the mouth.  Nom, nom. 

We look forward to returning when we're back in town."}
{"text":"I visited India Oven today with a bunch of friends. They close at 10 pm and we reached there around 9pm. Our friends were going to reach earliest by 9.30 pm but we were informed that they close the buffet and accept the last order at 9.30 pm. We were left with no choice but to order for everybody. Having worked in a fast food chain I understand how bad it is to trouble the chefs just before they close. But even after that they treated us really well.
I want to give a shout out to Mini the manager that day. He helped me out with the choice of the dishes. He was completely honest about how much quantity would be required for 6 people. He knows the dishes served really well and has very helpful inputs. Because we missed the buffet he offered us a complimentary Lamb Curry!
Now the main part- FOOD! It was amazing! It is hands down the best Indian food I have had since I have been in the US. Butter Paneer and Butter Chicken are two of the must haves here. Among other dishes we tried Chicken Tikka, Achari Chicken, Lamb Curry, Chicken Biryani, Garlic Naan(Their naans are amazing!). This was followed by complimentary ice creams!
 
All in all we had an amazing evening. It is a must try if you love Indian food and don't want to burn a hole in your pocket. The service and food is impeccable! What more can one ask for?!"}
{"text":"Why go: Indian Buffet 

As a current college student, I do see myself coming back here. One thing this place did lack was having Chicken Tikka Masala. I did come back for three rounds of curry though, but that's because I love curry.  I came here with five of my classmates and service was great.

What I had: 
Tandoori Chicken. Rating: 3.5/5
Lamb Vindaloo. Rating: 3/5
Spinach Side: Rating 3/5
Orange Sweet Drink. Rating: 2.5/5


Con: Buffet did not have Chicken Tikka Malsa"}
{"text":"What's the lowdown? Amazingly cheap, amazingly flavorful Indian food well-prepared and served at excellent prices by a friendly and attentive staff.

Oh, you want more? Why aren't you eating there yet?

The only thing keeping this restaurant from being 5 stars is that the atmosphere can be a bit odd at times. High-backed booth seating can make for a nicely intimate dinner date, but the presence of 2 large flat-screen tvs can become distracting for 1/2 of the table (depending on where you're seated within the restaurant).

The staff are unfailingly polite and attentive, as well as happy to explain the dishes for someone not familiar with Indian cuisine. The buffet comprises a very good selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Many of the staples don't change but there is enough rotation that I've never felt bored with the offereings. Beef, chicken, and lamb are all cooked equally well and the various sauces and curries exemplify the flavorful cooking tradition of India.

Back to what's important, I now want Indian for lunch. I hope you're happy..."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times and have never gone wrong with any of the chicken or lamb dishes.  I have not been able to bring myself to try any of the goat dishes yet, but it is on my bucket list.

This time around we had the Madrasi Lamb and Chicken Tikka Marsala which were both delicious.

The Chicken Pakoras were a great start to the meal.  Although they do slightly resemble chicken nuggets, they certainly do not taste processed.

We always enjoy any of their bread selections.  This time around it was Garlic Naan, but again, you can't really go wrong with any of them.

The Golab Jamon dessert--homemade cheese balls made from cream of milk in a scented light syrup--is ridiculous.  Tastes like small puffs of pancake-y heaven.

It is super inexpensive with most dishes in the $10 range.

The service is the best I've ever had.  Everyone is so friendly and accommodating.  The atmosphere is open and light.  Unfortunately, it is always a really slow whenever we go.  Hopefully, that only means that we come at the right time.  Everyone should be eating here."}
{"text":"Very bad experience!!. Gone for Dinner. Every dish is over priced!!. Ordered Chicken Samosa first and got a very small samosa (priced around $6!!!) and the filling was frozen and without any spices.

Ordered Hyderabadi chicken Biriyani ($19) and got basmati rice filled with chicken tikka masala. The chicken pieces were boneless and it is not Dum Biriyani.  When I asked about Dum biriyani the waiter said that we haven't written in the menu as Dum Biriyani...!!! surprised!!...So how the hyd biriyani is made??...
Don't go to this restaurant since everything is overpriced and don't have any standards."}
{"text":"Really delicious! I've been looking for some Indian food for awhile and decided to try this place out. Definitely going to have to become a regular. I got the Chicken Tikka Masala and it was the best I've had. as well as the naan, which was also excellent! A must go for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Very expensive, especially for the lack of ambiance.  
Why is it that Indian restaurants think they can charge a separate fee for rice in addition to the dishes?"}
{"text":"My husband and I was very surprised with the curry taste way better than expected We both will definitely will come back !"}
{"text":"I called in asking about the buffet to go, and I did not hear it was by the pound. When I walked in to the restaurant, they also said they told me it was by the pound. However, I did not hear that it was by the pound. I filled up my small cheap buffet tray and paid.  They did not give me ( based on what I heard) my money back. I told them I was given the wrong change. They then told me it was by the pound.  I said I don't want their food and I would like a refund. They refused me a refund, three times.  I paid cash, so I can't even report it to my credit card agency.  No matter how good their food may be, they have lost my business forever. It was a misunderstanding that they decided not to help their customer with.  I love Indian food and would have been a regular after I had finished my move into the neighborhood.  Definitely not a friendly place."}
{"text":"5 star buffet I came here from San Francisco on a road trip passing through and stopped at the Indian oven. I have to say great food great and great service! If I pass through again I will make it a  point to stop."}
{"text":"Really great Indian buffet and even better service. The food is great quality, good selection, and fast service. The first time I visited this restaurant my partner and I were surprised at how cheap it was. A place this good and we were expecting to pay a lot more. If you want to try something different order off the menu. Also boasts a full bar at very favorable prices. Give this place a shot, especially if you haven't had Indian food before."}
{"text":"Gonna be honest- I have no idea most of the time what I'm eating or how to even pronounce the foods I've eaten at India Oven. Buuuut if there's a picture of it in front of me or I'm at the actual buffet, I'm fairly certain of what it is. 

Abundance of garlic naan is sooooo my favorite [also bad for my low-carb diet], so if there's any sauce leftover from whatever meat + sauce combo I have on my plate, it's easily scooped up. It's also always piping hot when brought out! Never a dull moment when the staff is always on it for the naan. 

My favorite things are the paneer tikka masala [because cheese, duh], carrot dessert [although I prefer it pureed], chicken tikka masala, some lamb + sauce dish, and the mango lassi drink. I think they should put out larger glasses for lassi - those baby cups only last me like 2 sips! hah. Some of their vegetarian dishes are good too, but I can't recall what they are. 

The few times I've been their service has been amazing - whether it be with a few people, or a large group needing more space than others. All of these things make the $13 cost worth it!"}
{"text":"I will keep this review short and sweet.  The price of the buffet is great for what you get.  The food is awesome and the garlic naan is addicting!  I like to go for lunch sometimes on the weekends.  I like all the choices and that they have a vegetarian side of the buffet but I like both sides."}
{"text":"I got extremely sick about 2 minutes after getting in my car. Couldn't even make it home, had to pullover. Super mad I spent $30 on two people and both of us are sick. Think twice before eating here. Super weird staff to. They stared at us the whole time we were eating. Definitely never coming back here. This was awful."}
{"text":"Offers value-for-money buffets for lunch & Dinner. A good option if you are travelling from/to the Mesa airport which is just about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"The quality and flavor of their food is phenomenal. Another nice touch is they offer mango lassie on the buffet.  This was my first visit but won't be my last.  I highly recommend India Oven."}
{"text":"The buffet was delicious and had a great selection to choose from. The mango lasi (yogurt) drink was sweet and delicious and had my daughter going back for more. The fresh naan kept coming and we ended up with so much we were turning away extra. It was probably the service that impressed me the most. I can't say this enough, they treated their patrons very warmly and the service was quick.

I will definitely be going back. Keep up the great customer service!"}
{"text":"Accidentally found this place while out running errands and decided to give it a shot. I am so glad we did! The buffet food was delicious and flavorful and had just the right amount of spice. As a vegetarian I was thrilled with the amount of veggie options for me. I wanted to try a little bit of everything, but my eyes were bigger than my stomach so I'll have to go back again. The service was also excellent, they were prompt to refill drinks and bring naan bread. Overall I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Naan is cold, lamb is hard to chew, bowls are not clean at all. Service is not good either."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and we tried the dinner buffet. There is very little to no option. All I ate that day was a bunch of nans and two curries. They had two more curries which were not desirable to eat. They had two appetizers - pakoda and potato bajji. Both totally disappointing. I am not sure how difficult it is too season a potato bajj. It is just salt & chilli powder !!!. They cud not even do that instead went overboard with some weird spices which ended tasting bland. I tot their mango custard were scrambled eggs. Overall not an authentic indian restaurant even if they boast that they are. Another disappointment."}
{"text":"So good! They didn't make it to 5 stars due to the prices are a bit high for the amount of food and the location is a bit unsavory. 
The decor and atmosphere was surprisingly nice, from the outside I expected to be more run down inside. The staff was very nice. We were surprised how empty the dining room was for a Friday evening.
We got Vegetable Samosas to start then ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Rogan Josh, rice and plain Naan. Our only complaint was the lamb could've been more tender but everything was flavorful and delicious. 
I would definitely go again if given the chance."}
{"text":"Some of the most Bland Indian food in town. 

i eat Indian about once a week and would consider myself an \"Indian Buffet guru\". This Buffet is more than sub par with very awkward stand right by the table and stare at you type service. 

Bad. Pass. If you want better in this area try Guru Palace. But even still that place is not amazing either."}
{"text":"This place is great and very reasonably priced! It's one of the only places I know of (both in Las Vegas and AZ) that has buffet style for dinner too. I've eaten Indian food a good amount of times, but I still am not so familiar with the names of certain dishes, so I recommend this place for anyone who just wants to try a little bit of everything. Their cauliflower aloo gobi is my favorite and so is the kale and spinach saag. Lunch is about $7 a person for all you can eat, and dinner is $11-12 per person."}
{"text":"They are too slow irrespective of we 4 only in the restaurant ... The curries were over and we waited for more than 30 mins to get it... But lost against frustration n left with only veggie items... They kept lying it's on d way ....Be aware my friends."}
{"text":"Simply the best better than all the rest (pun-intended) :) had the buffet which I was able to be introduced to new food! Was skeptical at first with doing an Indian buffet but really this was really good. The waiting staff was on point and I was introduced to a new Lagar which went down smoothly. The picture of the orange drink was mango that went down like a milkshake that's better than yours! :) I had seconds of the chicken tiki masala. 10/10!"}
{"text":"India Oven serves above average traditional South Indian cuisine. One caveat: I've frequented here multiple times with a South Indian boyfriend and an Italian American boyfriend, and the experience is miles apart. The food was always fresh, hot, and mind blowingly spicy and flavorful with South Indian boyf, while comparatively cold and mild with Italian boyf.  Discriminatory practices aside, the mulagatani soup is always peppery and  flavorful, mango lassis are perfectly salted, the garlic naan and samosas are perfectly crispy, and (usually) the vindaloos and masalas are ultra flavorful. I recommend ordering extra spicy (think 8 if you usually order a 5 or 6), as they seem hesitant to load up on flavor if an American palette is present. Also, I prefer dinner to the lunch buffet (sometimes the lunch tray food is cold/old).

Addendum: They offer good fish and egg curry."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of buffets but this place was really good!  All the curries had amazing flavor! My favorite was the lamb vindaloo and the paneer masala!  You can't beat the speed and price of this delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Just great food!!!  
Prices reflect the fact that they know its that good.
We order from this restaurant around 6 times a year and its always the same great food."}
{"text":"This is my dad and I's go-to lunch spot, we've been coming here for a couple months now, and it's amazing every time. 

Lunch buffet is the best! The food is fresh and delicious, and theres a big selection to pick from (I still have a lot to try). My favorite are the lamb dishes, the meat is tender and flavorful.

Excellent service - there're always a handful of servers available nearby to refill drinks or take plates out of the way.

The price per person for the buffet is only about $10, which for an all you can eat is really good.

Haven't been disappointed yet! I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Even better now....now with every buffet order they bring you a fresh sizzling platter of tandoori chicken to your table. Can this place get any better? My favorite place ever! The staff is super attentive and you are never out of something to drink."}
{"text":"Best ever! So cheap for the food, very attentive staff, you can try everything and learn what is what in Indian food. They also have a liquor license which is nice too."}
{"text":"Food is ok but service sucks. I though they were having an off night but then it happened twice. I prefer Jewel of The Crown in Scottsdale. Their food is superb and the service is ALWAYS good and fair."}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite restaurants by far! They are very reasonably priced for a buffet. If you've never tried Indian food before and want to give it a go, this is the best place. My favorite dish is the Tiki Masala, and the mango yogurt drink is amazing! I always wish my stomach is bigger when I go, so I can eat more. 
MAKE SURE you note the lunch hours before you go. I think they close shop at 2:30, then re-open for dinner at 5. 
The owners are very kind and all the staff is always friendly and very attentive, especially for a buffet restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll never go back to this restaurant. I went on a Sunday night in May with a friend for the buffet. The naan was ok. It had a lot of cilantro all over it which was a little weird.  I was eating vegetarian that night so I had the paneer tikka masala. It didn't really taste like tikka masala but it wasn't bad. We asked for separate bills and the little pregnant lady brought back out receipts. I left a small tip even though it was a buffet and the total came up to $13.50. Why did they charge me $27. For a freaking buffet. She charged my credit card twice what I was supposed to be charged. I called them when I noticed it and the guy on the phone took my receipt number and told me the lady who could help with that doesn't come in until later and she would call me back. She never called me back. These people are dishonest and they will NEVER get my business again."}
{"text":"Really nice buffet for $8.  Comes with garlic naan, and mango lassis.  I love it!  Service is quick and friendly.  It's a bit far from my work, but worth the extra drive."}
{"text":"I had dinner here on a Tuesday night in October, 2012.
The place was not full.  At around 8 pm there were only about ten people at various stages of dinner.  The restaurant layout was nice with neat and comfortable tables and chairs, but it can't be said to be extravagant.
I had chicken vindaloo, and the meal tasted very good.  The side dishes (salad, naan, and dessert were good too.  I went to the McDonalds right next door for my after-dinner coffee.  Service was so-so.  In other words, normal for Indian restaurants.
I used the bus that night and the good news is that the restaurant is near the bus line that will take you back to the Strip.
I'll come back again, but I'll avoid busy times (weekend nights) based on the other reviews.
By the way, I wish that this website would post the reviews from the oldest to the newest.  That way, if a place, is much-improved you'll only read the most recent most relevant reviews."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The food is fantastic, some of the best I've had. The service is awesome as well. Very nice people run this restaurant. Basically, I eat so much I roll out of there like a beach ball. Well worth it, I want to try every dish. 

The vegetarian dishes are fantastic! I have not once gotten sick there either (except for the times I've eaten too much food, of course.) 

I give it an A++ and recommend everyone to go there! I have nothing more to say other than the food speaks for itself, so give it a try."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of about 11 people. We were quite the multicultural, quirky group of artist types, ranging in age from 20s to 40s, and each of us enjoyed the restaurant.  The food was great, and the waiters were attentive and polite even though a large group like ours isn't easy to manage sometimes.  The naan (bread) was so delicious; and I was able to dip it in each of four different sauces (one being ketchup!).   I also had the cheese naan- equally good.  My dinner was chicken korma (forget eating vegetarian that night!) which was awesome, but I was too full to finish it.  I would definitely come back, although I have to say that I am not from that area and got a little nervous about the characters hanging around or walking through the plaza. As a woman I  don't know how safe I'd be in that area alone at night.  But the plaza and parking areas were well-lit."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I haven't had Indian food in awhile and I pass this place all the time.  Finally, after a movie, the hubs and I stopped in.  It was really delicious.  Staff was friendly, lots of choices.  It was a great place to get a quick, filling meal.  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"First time here mostly because I live in Tucson.  When visiting family we like to try out some new places to add them to my list of favorite places to go.  The weather has been getting a bit cooler and that changes my inclinations for types of food.  So a recommended Indian Lunch Buffet caught  my radar today.  Very nice atmospheric place which gets me in the mood to feel like I am in India.   This is southern Indian food at its best.  They have the usual dishes set out like tandoori chicken loaded with sautéed onions which was very tasty.  Lamb curry was tasty though it seemed to be swimming in oil.  After draining out the oil albeit the lamb was soft and yummy. The Paneer was cooked in a wonderful sauce.  Chicken masala was great with very tender chicken pieces.  Many vegetable dishes that were quite tasty.  Also a great salad bar with raita dressing.  Basmati rice pudding with almonds and pistachios plus a mango creamy pudding.  Both wonderful.   Included was unlimited mango milk shakes from an unlimited urn.  The nam bread came around several times and it was really good. All in all it's a great place for lunch at just under 9 bucks.  It solved my problem for eating another meal that day.  Two huge plates was enough fuel for this day.  The staff was pleasant.  Kind of business like.  They start cleaning up at exactly 2.30 when the buffet ends.  The buffet is from 11.00 am to 2.30pm on the dot.  They close until dinner from 5.00pm to l0.00 pm."}
{"text":"I only went to the lunch buffet here and it seems they're going with quality over quantity.  Not too many choices at the buffet but the ones they did have were all tasty.  Hooray for white meat chicken!!"}
{"text":"Love it!!! Great friendly staff, even better food!! Probably the best quality buffet food ive ever had! I cant wait to return!"}
{"text":"The buffet was awesome.  Great price and great food. We left the place stuffed and satisfied."}
{"text":"Incredible Indian buffet! Fabulous food, lots of choices for both meat eaters and vegetarians. The waiters even walk around offering you plates of tandoori chicken. They have several delicious items on the dessert section of the buffet. AND the buffet includes a mango lassi dispenser! And hot chai tea! Omg, so great."}
{"text":"Awesome place !  Kid friendly. The food is out of this world. Slightly spicy but not overwhelming ! Prices are perfect and small children eat free ! Food is always fresh and wait staff/ owners are attentive and kind. My favorite Indian restaurant !"}
{"text":"Hoh. My. Goodness. How I have missed you Indian Food. A trip to India Oven should be on everyone's \"Must Do List\". Buffet style (unless you wish to order an entree) has hidden dangers. You might eat too much.  

The food is clearly labeled into groups. (Non-Vegetarian, Vegetarian, Salads and Dessert). I recommend diving in unless you feel strongly about eating a particular type of meat. I sampled (like a pack of starving dogs) every item and enjoyed every bite. My pants may not fit, but that has nothing to do with my ability to write. 

(Full Disclosure: I have eaten tons of Indian food in my hey day.) As the restaurant serves Northern Indian cuisine spice is not a concern. Food items were moderately (to mildly) spiced and the majority were cream based. Dishes were well balanced with ghee (or whatever oil is used). 

Naan is delivered to the table as is tandoori chicken. (Just try it kids! You'll like it.) Rice is available at the buffet. I was surprised to find mango lassi (a yogurt drink) and chai tea as part of the buffet price. ($12 total during dinner.)

India Oven prefers to have groups pay on one check. However have no fear! Our large party was individually able to pay directly at the cashier. However, that might have been possible as we all ordered the same thing. (Buffet!)

Thank you India Oven for hosting our very large group. Yelp International Supper Club UYE rocked!"}
{"text":"Not a typical stop for a date night with my wife but we wanted to try something different and have heard the good reviews of India Oven. They definitely set the standard for customer service. First time visiting, they are very busy and there is limited seating but I haven't seen anyone wait too long for a seat. We got the buffet which I think is what most people do. I don't know what most of the food is but it is all very good and the bread keeps coming.  My wife and I both like the lamb dishes the best. I reserve 5 stars only because it is my first visit but I understand and agree with the 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've ever had! This place was amazing. The buffet was only $10 and it had a great selection. It came with naan... Amazing! The service was great also. :) I definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Tasty indian food, great service. I like the buffet style establishments, that offer truly delicious meals Will be coming for more."}
{"text":"By far the best indian food i have had in usa. They now  have buffet at dinner too! Everything tastes awesome and there are a lot of veggie options to try out."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place! They are super friendly, have excellent service, and the food is always delicious. I also love that it is nice enough of a place for a date with the hubby, but they also offer carry out. We always get the buffet because everything is awesome, but my favorites are the chicken tikka masala, the naan, and the gulab jamun. Weather you're already a lover of Indian food or you've never tried it, visit India Oven and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"The buffet is fantastic, the variety is huge! but be cautious, some dishes are extremely spicy so start with a tiny sample of each. The Chicken Tikka Masala and Mango Lassi are incredible along with the continuous influx of proper Garlic Naans. The ambience is fair and customer service is also good. Just visited this place once but would love to go there anytime. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went here the other day with a friend after reading all of the glowing reviews, but it was just ok! Sad day. The people who work here are very nice and friendly and the price really can't be beat, but the food was not the best I have had around the valley. We both got the buffet (of course) and it had high points and low points. I thought the lamb (or goat?) was a little tough (usually it's so tender from being cooked in the sauce all day....not really the case) and the same with the chicken. The chicken tikka masala sauce was really tasty though....gotta love that. I also liked that the buffet comes with mango lassi and chai tea...definite plus. I did not, however, like that they brought out the tandoori chicken to every table because I don't like tandori chicken and I felt really bad just leaving it there.... maybe they should ask first so they don't waste their food.... Anyway, the buffet is large and has a lot of variety, but the flavor just isn't as good as some other buffets....maybe I'll give them another shot sometime in the future, it could have just been the night..."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some Indian style tea ($3.50) in the early evening hours. The place was completely empty and they were just getting setup for the evening service yet it took more than 30 minutes to prepare three cups of tea to go. Taste wise it was a major let down. To begin with it was made without sugar and we were expected to add it separately much like English tea. I've never seen this anywhere else as Indian tea is always sweet and you specifically have to ask for no sugar if you want is separately. Apart from that there was no ginger or cardamom so it had a very flat taste. A complete waste of time that I will not repeat."}
{"text":"Be prepared for your taste buds to experience an epic explosion of flavors and tastes you never imagined! Flavorful!!"}
{"text":"First visit to the Indian Oven today. We were greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant  and were quickly seated.  We were very excited to try the food. If it tasted anything like the smells coming from the kitchen we were going to be very happy.  We both ordered the chicken tikka masala mild. It was very good!  We were happy we ordered mild as it was just right!!  We also ordered 1 regular naan. It was huge!  Enough really for 2-3 people.  Was surprised that rice was an extra charge, this something that we have seen as a separate charge at other Indian restaurants. We recommend the Indian Oven.  We will definitely be returning to the Indian Oven."}
{"text":"One of my three favorite buffet experiences of all time!!

The other two were held at my wedding reception (amazing home-cooked Polish food) and aboard a cruise ship. While I'll never return to either, I'm so glad that India Oven is one I'll get to revisit often. For me, it was the best of both worlds. Professional service and food prepared with real heart.

On a Friday night, after work, my family decided to indulge me and I got to pick our dinner destination. I've never been more glad that I chose someplace new.
And based on (yes) YELP reviews, I decided we'd head over to India Oven and give it a try.

The moment we walked in the door we were greeted professionally by smiling staff members that imply, without saying, that your dinner experience is going to be something special.

While there is a dinner menu, one quick pass by the buffet (which is smaller, but without question more flavorful, than most) convinced me that I'd go for the all-you-can-eat experience. 

The buffet line is divided into three segments; vegetarian, non-vegetarian (chicken, lamb & goat dishes) & salad/dessert.  There wasn't one item that I put on my plate that wasn't a symphony of flavor that combined so well with the next dish.  Everything was seasoned so well and absolutely delicious.

Like many of the reviewers I've read who've already had the pleasure of experiencing the food here, the only problem was my stomach wasn't  larger. I left the table stuffed to the gills. I could tell that whoever was responsible for the fresh and flavorful buffet really cared about the people they were cooking for. Believe me, you can actually taste it.

Try it! You'll love it. And I've never been more motivated to leave a large tip after a buffet style dinner. Not my typical M.O., but the service is really that good.

5 absolutely well earned STARS! India Oven combined excellent service and a stellar buffet and I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! I had been here once before a while back with my mom but went back solo this time for the lunch buffet.

They bring fresh garlic naan & sizzling tandoori chicken legs to your table. The mango lassi (absolutely delicious & even a bit chilled, to my surprise) is included at the buffet. The vegetable samosas/pakoras are soooo tasty & crispy, not soggy or greasy. I always like to start with all the above & a bit of salad before digging into the curries and rice. 

My choices for the curries were the chicken tikka masala which was great, the palak paneer tastes really fresh, the rice is really good & I loved the lentils.

The only thing I would change would be the lamb vindaloo. It's usually one of my favorites, but it wasn't spicy enough & although the lamb was super tender, it's not really a vindaloo if it doesn't have a serious kick. Quick fix? The chili sauce by the salad & samosas can remedy this ;)

I basically pigged out on lots of delicious food for $10, satisfied my craving for Indian & read my book over my lunch hour in a nice quiet spot. I'll be back soon! :)

{"text":"Hmmmm what to say about this place. I guess I was a little bit disappointed that I made a trek out here from Central Phoenix based on the great Yelp reviews but wasn't all that impressed after eating here. To be fair- I can only speak to the lunch buffet. I felt like all the dishes on the hot bar were just ok- there want any one dish that made me want to eat more. I did appreciate the multiple dessert options and the gratis mango lassi. Still, I wouldn't drive out of my way to go there again."}
{"text":"I want to start out by saying this is the best indian food my boyfriend and I have ever had. We had the Chicken Khuma, Chicken Tikka Masala, rice and naan. Everything was so full of flavor, definitely made that day.
The staff was very friendly, always checking in and filling up our drinks. 
Even though it was only across the street from our hotel, if your driving there's plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Amazing service, buffet and great price! Best advice I have is go on during the lunch buffet, they have really good service too!"}
{"text":"This place is authentic and family owned. I have eaten here many times because my bf really loves Indian food, especially the mango lassi. I'm not crazy about Indian food but it's very good here. We got the pleasure of meeting the owners son and he was very nice. We had questions about the ingredients in some of the food, specifically the tea, and he was very helpful. He told us many of the recipes are his mothers! I thought that was really cool because you could tell he was passionate about the food. 

If you like tea, both the hot and cold tea here are spectacular. They have vegetarian options too, which I enjoy. We like this place a lot and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Once again Yelp gets it right! This was my first time to an Indian restaurant and Indian cuisine so I did my research via Yelp. I found India Oven to have 4.5 star review with over 600 reviews. After all 600 Yelpers can't be wrong. Many of the reviews were from people with Indian sounding names so I decided to give this place a try.

It is not lavishly decorated, but it does lend to a middle eastern ambience. I came for the lunch buffet on a Saturday which was suggested on one of the reviews. There were several kinds of lamb and chicken dishes and a number of vegetarian ones also. I did try them all. 

The lamb vindaloo was good, not as spicy as the lamb masala. Both dishes had large pieces (about an inch cubed) of lamb cooked in a spicy tomato gravy and diced potatoes. The lamb masala was my favorite item on the buffet. The basmati rice was the perfect compliment to the lamb masala. 

The chicken dishes were also cooked in a spicy gravy. he chicken curry was mildly spicy and the chicken vindaloo was medium heat. My favorite was the chicken Tandoori. Pieces of chicken baked with a mild spicy coating.

A few other dishes I really liked were kadni pakora. a kind of dumpling in a curry gravy, and the chana masala, chick peas and ginger on a spicy sauce.

The deserts were nothing to write home about, but the mango lassi was to die for. A smooth creamy mango punch that you can refill as often as you like. And yes, as the yelpers said, unlimited naan. They come around every 10 minutes with more hot off the grill. Thank you Yelpers. My virgin Indian dining experience was truly a good one."}
{"text":"I loveeeeeee this place. The lunch buffet is super affordable and everything tastes amazing. They are constantly refilling everything so nothing is ever running low. A great place to try Indian food for the first time."}
{"text":"I was wanting Indian food while I was home and hopped onto Yelp for suggestions. I went during lunch with my brother and his friend (who likes this place a lot). It is located in a strip mall right next to another buffet. It wasn't terribly busy when I went but the food was delicious; from what I recall, there were 2 lamb dishes, 3 chicken dishes (including tandoori), salad, a variety of vegetarian dishes, and at least 3 different desserts. Fresh garlic naan is brought to your table. They also had tea and mango lassi to drink. The service was very friendly, and the food is some of the best Indian I've had. I typically expect less at these prices, but I can definitely say that I was pleasantly surprised!

Just a bit of warning from my friend to you, try not to go in with clothing you plan on wearing again soon before washing. You won't be able to tell since you came out of Indian food heaven, but others around you will :P"}
{"text":"I usually go to that Indian place south of the 60 on Gilbert, but based on reviews of this place I took a friend here for dinner.  He checked out the buffet and said he wanted to try it, so (even though I know better) I did too.  I tried 4 different colored chicken dishes (the tandoori offering was all gone) and they were all dry from sitting on the table too long and tasted the same.  No complexity to the sauces.  The cauliflower was overcooked from sitting on the steam table.  One dish that was supposed to be lamb seemed not to be.  The Chicken Briyani was dry and a little crusted.  The complimentary naan seemed reheated or stale.  The best thing I tasted was the Lamb Vindaloo.  It was good!  When I went back for dessert there was a full tray of tandoori chicken so I tried that and it was dry.  The desserts were okay.  The restaurant itself is kind of...dingy.  
Yelpers, you let me down on this one."}
{"text":"Overall: I definitely recommend this place!

Food: I went in for lunch buffet and the food were all very good. They all had great flavor, and they have a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian section. I love that you are able to have unlimited of naan bread. 

Service: All the servers were very attentive. They walk around to check if you needed more naan and they clear your plate after you are done. They were very kind but they were quiet majority of the time. The restaurant was very clean as well. 

Cost: Since I only came in for lunch, I can only say the cost for lunch is a decent price. I don't remember the exact amount but it was around $10 for lunch buffet. I would definitely say the price is definitely worth the amount of great food you can get!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indian restaurant I ever tasted.  The food is fresh, knife skills is superb which is a signature of quality chef.   After telling them that I found the Ad in the paper for $6.95 for Buffet, they honored my offer immediately and didn't even have to pay extra for Mango Lassi which comes with the Buffet.  They even have dinner Buffet.  This former Taj Mahal restaurant owner from Tempe have relocated to this new location and it is such of bless.   The service is very attentive and she asked me is there anything she can do for me to make us happy.  Definitely went an extra mile just to please us.  Delightful.  Since I was a Chinese restaurant owner for over 15 years, who is extremely picky about my food, they have my gold seal of approval."}
{"text":"This was the best place to bring my parents for my birthday dinner!!! Everything was spiced spot on!!! Delicious!!!! Now my dad had a problem with the spices but enjoyed his Arnold Palmer drink, I ordered mom tandoori chicken which she tried n liked, I got to take ALL her leftovers home!!!! Seemed a bit pricey for dinner but OHHH SOOOO GOOOD for the person who enjoys great india food!!! Go here!!! I will try for lunch some day... Excellent 5 thumbs up.... I mean stars!!!"}
{"text":"I'm typing this from deep in the haze of a food coma after visiting India Oven.  We took the whole family and oh my......for $11.95 this is the best dinner deal in town!  All the meat dishes were delicious, of course, but honestly I think the vegetable korma was my favorite thing.  The mango pineapple custard was amazing too.  Tea, mango lassi, and endless garlic naan included......get down there!"}
{"text":"Rude discourteous unprofessional...these are just a fee if the words to describe the service we experienced. We were still eating when they closed like three other groups and they literally they hurrying us up so they can leave at 10pm!! They started running the vacuum so much so that we couldn't hear our conversation. One guy kept walking by and glaring at us! Very uncomfortable and the worse experience I've had at any restaurant in any continent. The food was ok, not the best Indian good I've had but dining is a total experience and I would never recommend this place. They literally shut off the music, turned off some lights and we were still eating? Who does that?"}
{"text":"We went to India oven after trying mint a couple of times, which by the way great restaurant with good food and decent price.

The ambience wasnt great, waiter seemed like traditional Indian gujju broken english. We ordered two vegeterian dishes dinner format that includes one naan and half rice ($18 each). Price was hefty but food was good. However the service was pathetic. There were couple of different people serving the table without proper communication withing themselves. We asked the first waiter for togo boxes for our left over food, however different waiter showed up and started to trash the food. We asked for an additional naan togo and that different waiter came back without naan even though they charged for it. When I asked about the naan he said he was not not told as if it was my duty to tell each time a different waiter shows up. All in all I wont recommend this place if you are looking at a good experience."}
{"text":"Wow, what a bargain! Delicious dinner buffet for only $10 and that includes a hot spicy tea and mango lassi. Great service and clean. My only suggestion would to move the rice to the beginning of the buffet so that stupid Americans don't double back in line."}
{"text":"We have been going here for a couple of years. We love this place. The food is always hot, delicious, and a good value. We always get the buffet, whether lunch or dinner, which has numerous meat and vegetarian dishes. The spice level varies at times, but not significantly so. Hot Chai tea and Mango Lassi are included with your meal. How awesome is that???!!! The waitstaff are attentive with drink refills and anything else one might need. Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food and selections. Much better than I thought I would get from a buffet. It was reasonably priced for the variety and quality of food. Service was excellent. Very attentive wait staff. My water glass was never empty. I will definitely be bringing out of town guests here. They also have an attached banquet hall that I'll have to check out if I ever host large events."}
{"text":"We were visiting the area from New York and chose to give India Oven a try. The buffet was fresh and delicious. The staff was quick and courteous. We had a really great experience."}
{"text":"Just LOVE this place!  I always get the all-you-can-eat buffet which has an amazing range of food choices for all kinds of eaters.  The meat section has a variety of chicken, beef, lamb, and goat dishes.  For vegetarians like myself, about a third of the food bar is made up of different veggie-only dishes--my favorite being the Paneer Tikki Masla--I always go back for a second helping!  The servers (who are all very attentive and pleasant) bring out a steady stream of hot garlic naan bread--which is my second fave thing there!  They also have a small salad bar and mango lassi, mango custard, and rice pudding for dessert.  If you go for dinner, they bring tandoori chicken to your table along with the naan--so if you're vegetarian, make sure you tell them not to bring you any from the get go!  

Bollywood music videos play on all the TV's.  The place can get pretty packed around peak lunch and dinner hours, so go early!  Lunch buffet costs $8.95 and dinner buffet runs $9.95.  Pretty decent prices for amazing all-you-can-eat Indian food.  Definitely the best around!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place and eat here a lot. The buffet is replenished regularly and they have a nice selection of meat and vegetarian items. I am definitely a carnivore but all the flavors are tasty. The staff is always friendly and very kind to my kids. The price is reasonable as well. Worth a visit if you like Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Buffet is amazing. Has everything you need. Buffet is everyday. One of my favorite Indian buffers. Lots of vegetarian options too. Just prepared when you go there to leave stuffed!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to India Oven many times.  But before I used to also go to Kohinoor Indian Cuisine in Tempe, because they ran Groupons that were 50% off.  I could eat at Kohinoor for as little as $5 for lunch, but had has conditions such as you have to order one separate food item such as dessert or drink, in addition to your buffet.   But at some time in the last 2 years, Kohinoor eliminated any other meat, other than chicken, even at their dinner buffet. No lamb, goat or beef, just chicken. Their buffet does not include drink. Kohinoor's Indian beer for $10 for 22 oz costs $2 more than India oven $8 for same bottle. Now (Aug 2017) their Groupon is asking you to pay more than you used to pay, for less discount. So now you only get about 33% discount, pay $16 for $24 value for two, when before you got 50%, but the requirement to buy one food item has always been the same. Also, the lady answering the Kohinoor phone, can be very rude, sometimes.

Now I go to India Oven because for the same price for dinner $11.95, IO has both goat AND lamb dishes, as well as chicken, in their dinner buffet. AND India Oven has free chai and mango lassi which can cost $2.50 - $4 for one glass at other Indian restaurants. The goat at India Oven is soooooo good! But other than IO has red meats, and Kohinoor only chicken in their buffets, to me, their other selections are very similar in taste.

I have hosted MeetUp groups of 20 people here at India Oven for dinner buffet, and last night, 4 of us went for a friend's birthday.  Service was always very good and attentive.  Seems like one man's job was just to fill water glasses.  

I love the chicken tika gravy, sooooo delicious, I mash their cauliflower into the tika gravy.  The goat stew is soooooo good, goat fall-off-the-bone.  The lamb cubes were hard and tough, so I stuck with the goat.  

Mango lassi is soooo good, too.  Naan delicious and thin and crispy.  However one change I do not like.  A few years ago when you ordered only the dinner buffet, IO brought out freshly grilled Tandoori chicken to each table, with grilled onions.  You could smell the charbroil aroma.  NOW, the Tandoori chicken is at the buffet in a bin, and it is dried out.  No thanks, no more chicken for me.  I will stick with the goat.  Food is not spicy, to meeeeee.......

I've never ordered off the menu, because the buffet is such terrific value."}
{"text":"Amazing buffet and great value for the money. Good was fresh and hot always! Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am a total Indian Cuisine Noob.  I have loved Indian food every time I've had it, but I usually go with Indian guys who just order for all of us.  So I was a little out of my element when I called and ordered take-out.  

However, on the phone I attempted to order what I thought I wanted.  They were very helpful asking me what I had liked in the past, and based on my descriptions confirmed I was ordering the right dish.  They asked if I wanted some Nan with it, and not knowing what it was I said no.  They were surprised and asked, \"No nan??\" and I confirmed.

When I went to pick it up, the woman at the register said, \"I think you want Nan so I included it, no charge.\" She was right...I should have ordered it with Nan.  Noob mistake, but they took care of it anyway.  Food was delicious and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Visiting form the east coast, was hoping to find a good spicy curry bit found the buffet hard to turn down. Large variety of traditional Indian dishes which all looked and smelled great. 
Service was excellent. Out server even brought a fresh samosa to our table when the buffet ran out. 
The mixed veggies hiding under the tandoori chicken were my favorite. Spicy and crispy delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried the lunch buffet with some friends. Lots of good, solid dishes. Lamb vindaloo was flavorful without being too spicy, though the meat was a bit tough. Chicken curry was really good. I thought the palak paneer and malai koftai were fine. I really liked the paneer tikka masala; the paneer was cooked well and the flavor of the sauce was spot on.

Servers walk around replacing garlic naan as needed on your table, so you get it fresh, though if you're with a group you might have to wait a little while. I usually don't care for the desserts at Indian restaurants, especially buffets, because the taste and quality make it appear as though they were an afterthought, but the gulab janum were pretty solid at India Oven. I would probably skip the kheer.

Servers were nice, restaurant was clean, and there's a full bar, which was unexpected but nice if you're stopping in for dinner (or just want a really fun lunch!). I don't know if I'd make a special trip out here, but if I'm in the area and want some Indian food, I would stop in again."}
{"text":"Buffet was generous with variety - 3 fried appetizers, about 6 vegetarian entree items, and the Naan-man came by every few minutes to drop of small cuts of Naan.  Price was at the higher side for Indian buffets in Phoenix but it was a dinner buffet so I suppose no complaint there.  I thought the food was on par with the average for Phoenix though, which isn't exactly a compliment.  Very low spicy/heat level on all entrees I tried.  I'm puzzled by the high ratings for this place.

Location is in a strange stand alone building that holds a small number of businesses.  Felt small inside.  Decor and atmosphere OK.

Major concern:  There feels like a substantial limitation exists here because they offer buffet at both dinner and lunch.  Sure, you can order off the menu, but why?  Will your entree be a pain for the cook who is trying to maintain this big buffet?"}
{"text":"Amazing chana masala and the spice levels were very good - exactly what I ordered, and it was hot!  Overall breads were good as well, and the food was the main reason to go here.  Service could have been much better and it is a somewhat sketchy location next to a \"massage parlour\"."}
{"text":"Been here once. The buffet is totally worth it. Lots of options for authentic Indian cuisine. All in all it was delicious bellyful meal although there were couple of items on the buffet which weren't up to the mark. The Chicken Tikka Masala and Mango Lassi are incredible along with the continuous influx of proper Garlic Naans. The ambience is fair and customer service is also good."}
{"text":"I've eaten at India Oven more times than I can count; the servers who seat us are kind, gracious and funny, especially now that I know them well enough to joke around. The naan is always piping hot, perfectly crisp and soft/chewy (it is too good, according to my daughter who always eats too much of it, LOL) 

I always look forward to the lassi and tea that is included with my meal, something I very much appreciate about their buffet. Beer, including Indian options, are available as well.

All of the dishes are delicious; they have a nice balance of chicken, lamb, paneer and vegetarian options. Mint chutney, tamarind sauce, raita condiments included...yum. 

Go, enjoy the food and try not to eat too much. You'll be glad you went."}
{"text":"I came to India Oven the day before July 4th.  My intention was to see the quality and variety of food as a potential option to cater for my wedding in the near future.  Usually most buffets have 3-4 main dishes, but there were like almost 10 different dishes.  I wish I had a bigger plate or 2 stomaches!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in the East Valley.  The buffet is always fresh and the Garlic Naan plentiful.   I have also ordered off the menu a few times and was very happy with what I ordered.  

The Tandoori Chicken is amazing, as is their Chicken Tikka Masala.   The vegetarian fare is excellent also.  The Paneer Tikka Masala is perfect, rich and creamy with a bit of spice.   I pretty much eat here at least once a week.  The food never disappoints and the staff is attentive and very friendly"}
{"text":"I generally avoid buffets.  They're just not my thing.  However, I was seriously craving some Indian food for lunch today, and I'd had this place bookmarked to try.  All I can say is that I'm glad I broke my buffet rule and gave India Oven a spin.  This place was phenomenal!!!  Hot food, great quality and stellar service...all three things I usually find buffet joints lacking in.  The garlic naan was probably the best naan I've ever had.  Go here.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The first #ISCUYE without Monica O. *sniff, sniff* so it was a bit subdued compared to other events. But the food was pretty tasty. It's about time we went to an Indian place! I am not usually a big fan of buffets but this one was pretty good. I liked that they had separated out the vegetarian vs meat dishes so you could more or less tell what you were getting. My fav for the night was the lamb vindaloo. Very tasty with some flavorful spice but not too hot at all. I also really enjoyed that they brought out fresh baked naan to the table. I skipped the desserts but the mango lassi was a nice, light, sweet end to the meal."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a weekday.  I grew up in the Bay Area and have a soft spot for Indian food.  The only item on the menu was the buffet.  The selection and quality of the buffet was pretty average."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times now, and every time the food and the service are excellent.  The food is always fresh, and the garlic naan is awesome.  One thing that stood out to me right away from every other Indian restaurant I've ever been to is they give you ice in your drink.  I'm not sure what that's all about, but it was a welcome change.  The buffet comes with mango lassi and chai tea, which is also a rarity.  If you are going for the dinner buffet, it also comes with tandoori chicken delivered steaming to your table.  While I do love this place, I agree with some of the other reviews that say that this tandoori chicken isn't the best.  I had no idea it wasn't all you can eat, because I rarely eat what they give me.  I usually find it to be dry.  The reasons this place does not get 5 five stars is the aforementioned tandoori chicken, and I wish there was a little more variety on the buffet.  Prices are reasonable, around $10 per person plus drink.  

As a side note: There is very limited parking in front of this place, and be careful not to park in the neighboring smoke shop's parking spaces when they are open."}
{"text":"Pricing was OK. Food was decent but not great. More flavor and spice preferred. Staff never let the water run low. Good mango lassi. Chicken in Tikka Masala was tender, but still on the hunt for the perfect Tikka Masala!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting India Oven when they were on Sahara West of the Strip a smaller footprint than the current location, I have seen several Indian restaurants that have sprung up all over the Valley but India Oven is the only authentic cuisine. My favorite is Chicken Karahi served in a brass vessel shaped like wok (karahi). The chicken is as tender and fresh and it has never lacked in the quality that I am used to more than fifteen years that I have been eating at this place.Always order a wine with Indian food since beer will make you belly full. They have the best selection of wine specially Robert Mondovi Woodbridge special merlot which tastes like a cabernen, The ambience is good. You can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Bye far one of the better Indian food places I have been to 

Chicken wings with dipping sauce -- OMG the sauce is amazing caught myself dipping the naan bread into it. 

Chicken samsosa - was good just a little less stuffing but great

Green and red sauces -- the green dipping sauce was soo good almost tomateo salsa like and the red wing was amazing 

Also had chicken tandorri -- really good not dry can pull apart chicken. 

Dessert naan 

Overall very excited to learn about this place, really great food spices and all. I have been craving Indian food since I got introduced in Phx. This beets them hands down. 

Will be back Great taste, Great Flavor etc.."}
{"text":"Good lunch buffet.  Good variety of food.  I got there just at opening so everything was fresh.  The buffet had both rice pudding and mango lassi so I'm happy."}
{"text":"Really delicious food and great staff.  The soups are actually tiny (and by tiny i really mean it), but tasty. And quite enough for a starter just before the tasty veggie courses ( sorry - vegetarian here, so i tried only those options). The neighborhood is not the best but the restaurant is really close to Las Vegas blvd. 
Overall is a good place to eat with indian beer :)"}
{"text":"Pricy and ok tasting. Is close to stratosphere and the only nearby one so I chose to go here. There are others in a mile or so."}
{"text":"This place was excellent! My husband and I came here and everything was delicious. We talked about it all the next day after eating here. They also have great wine and I love the Hindi atmosphere. It was quiet and the server and manager took great care of everyone."}
{"text":"Immediately following the warm welcome from one of the highly attentive waiters, you are pleasantly taken by the aromas of Aloo, Saag and Masalaa. Shortly after seating, they bring fresh out-of-the-oven naan. The ingredients are always fresh and the food never disappoints. The buffet has a vast array of meat and vegetarian dishes and don't forget to try the mango lassi. This is confidently one of my top Indian food picks in the greater Phoenix area. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian places. I love the buffet because you can try any if the dishes. They have the Indian tea free as part of the buffet. They also have the mango juice which is awesome. Every time I come here they have slightly different desert which is a nice change. When you sit at the table they bring some garlic naan and tandoori chicken. Everything here tastes amazing and you leave really full because you want to try everything. Dinner buffet for 10$ doesn't get much better. Don't have any complaints."}
{"text":"We have been going to India oven since before my son was born....well over 6 years now. The owner was so cool he stood my 1 year old son in one hand to teach us a balance trick.  They always have a clean place and as always the food has been the best.  My husband and I have tried most of the Indian resturants Mesa/Phoenix area and we always wish we had went to India oven instead.  They are the best by far over all and I highly recommend trying it.  They are almost always busy but they are still fast as well.  I'm sure most will agree.  By far the best in 100 mile area!"}
