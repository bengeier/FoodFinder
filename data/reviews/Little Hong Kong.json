{"text":"We were here last Saturday for dinner, food was really good. We ordered Black Pepper Chicken combination platter and Mangolian Chicken. The egg drop soup from the combination platter was refreshing. The egg roll was ok. The main dishes were served hot and tasted delicious. The staff was very attentive and open to changes in food. We got a complimentary desert  which was awesome.
This restaurant is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food, environment, people, etc.  I have always enjoyed coming here to eat and their friendly staff makes it a visit worth while. The food is always great and the prices are excellent. I recommend this restaurant to anyone at anytime. You will not go wrong."}
{"text":"For the location, convenience, and quick stop for Chinese food, this place is good! They have Lumpia and Pancit Bihon; definitely will hold you over until you get to your favorite place waaaaay on the other side of town."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed that Yelp still has not implemented a zero star rating.  This place deserves it.  

Ordered the Gen Tso's Chicken, usually a safe bet anywhere.  Not so much tonight. I requested extra spicy.  What arrived was a plateful of overcook and very hard bits of chicken that has no spice and no flavor.

The best part of my meal was the white steamed rice."}
{"text":"I took the family there when I first got to the area back in December 2015. Food was really bad overall. The only exception was the egg rolls, which were pretty good. Tasted like you found really good egg rolls in a supermarket and then fried them at home. Service echoed others on yelp (dump food on table and don't come back). All of this and it's in a sketchy part of town... would recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I just got back to work after eating at Little Hong Kong and I am so happy I found this place.  I have worked in the are for 3 years and there are not many places to eat for lunch.  

I enjoyed the Orange Chicken and my friend had the Chicken Chow Mein.  Both dishes were big (enough to split) and very good.  We both had enough to take home for lunch tomorrow.  Each dish came with Egg Roll, fried wonton, vegetable fried rice and the choice of salad bar or Egg Drop Soup.  You can not beat the prices $6.50 each.  Also, we were in and out in less then an hour.

If you are looking for a clean, friendly enviornment and good food I recommend Little Hong Kong!!!"}
{"text":"One of my worst meals ever. Yuck! Had sesame chicken, I swear they used sauce out of a jar. The wonton soup that came with was mediocre. The fried rice was completely awful. The egg roll also awful. Maybe the rest of you are easily pleased? I won't be returning. I would imagine it stays open another month at most."}
{"text":"I wish people would post pictures of the food here because it would help a lot!

Anyways, the place was not busy. I placed an order for pancit and Mongolian beef... It took forever!!! 35 mins was unnecessary. Would I come back? No. This was my first visit.

Pancit was less than ok. It lacks flavor and veggies.
The Mongolian beef was the worst we've ever had, anywhere. The taste was very off... The texture was extremely rubbery. All I could taste was the loaded sauce, which btw, spilled in the bag. I've had this dish at different places, made different at each location. This ranks last place.
Both were overpriced. We had plenty left over and went to garbage."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new restaurant. The place is very clean and the food is very good.  I hope they will be able to keep it in this condition because if they do I will be returning many times!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh, delicious, and our order perfect.  Fast and friendly service.  Both my husband and my father say this is one of the best hot and sour soups they have ever had. I am partial to their crab rangoons.  I've tried many different menu items and they are all superb. Prices are very reasonable too. If you love yummy chinese, check out Little Hong Kong."}
{"text":"One of the best buffet I have been to in an very long time. Food was very hot and fresh, the service was fantastic staff was very friendly. I never had to wait for a drink I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The best take out Chinese in the North Ridgeville area. Expect the standard Chinese comfort food menu with the food well seasoned and prepared. I only wish they delivered."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the Chinese food close to the Air Base and found this place.
The staff was very friendly, the wait was only about 10 minutes and the food was great.
Nothing to complain about here!
I'll be back."}
{"text":"HORRIBLY AWFUL!!!  1 Punk Girl and 1 dirty cook was there at 1 pm for lunch on a Friday. I walked in, waited a minute then sat myself. Girl was behind the counter with her feet up texting. She acknowledged me. I had to get up after that and get my own menu. Lazy girl. Placed my order at the counter to speed things up. She seemed inconvenienced by me. She put the order in. I heard the cook in the back making my order. He kept sneezing. Freaked me out."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Food service and prices GREAT. Personal preference did not care for moo shu pork. Went for lunch really clean and fresh everything. Best service ever. Love it love it and can afford it."}
{"text":"The best chinese food around.  Polite, clean, and great service. The buffet is great as well!"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST Chinese I've Ever had!!! We just moved to the area, and we were craving for Chinese... Bee arrived here because of Yelp and cause was so close... Best decision ever!! Loved it loved it loved it!! Lots of food, good prices and food cooked to perfection... I'm
Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I found this place randomly when looking for some Chinese food in the area. 

I've been back several times even though is a bit out of the way because it's that good.
The little Hong Kong fried rice is a favorite of mine"}
{"text":"So far so good. Second time in here and I like their food. Pretty quite place. Great for my son, who is 10 months old."}
{"text":"Was starving after walking the lake to lake trail, was skeptical of this place at first, outside appearance gives it a \"mall Chinese food\" sort of vibe with the lunch buffet sign and logo, but boy was I wrong!!!

This was hands down the best Chinese I've had in a while. Order the wonton soup and you will not be disappointed! Actual homemade wonton full of delicious meat and not 95% noodle like the other places!

I also ordered the house special lo-mein and ate the entire plate it was so delicious and fresh. 

Also an added bonus is that entire menu is NO MSG. Amazing service, very friendly and accommodating, and inside decor is nice. 

Great prices, people, and food. Can't go wrong with Little Hong Kong (yes I know I just rhymed)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a new Chinese restaurant this is it!!!! Sweet and sour chicken, rice, egg rolls, rangoons, everything amazing!!!!! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This was an interesting experience. Some of our food was very good and some was not. My son ordered sampler appetizer, hot sour soup and Hunan chicken. I ordered Wonton soup and veggie lo mein.  

Service was very slow as it was Christmas day & only one very friendly (and apologetic) server was on her own... I won't judge service this time. 

Hot sour soup was very good... Won ton not so good... Tepid, bland and the wontons were doughy. Appetizer was mixed... Egg roll was very good... The rest... Not so good. My son like the Hunan and the lo mein was great. Will try their mu shu next time. 

Ok... Went back today and again ordered the hot sour soup (again, very good) the veggie mu shu... Very good... And veggie fried rice... Good but I will try pork fried rice next time. 

Been looking for a \"go to\" Chinese restaurant for s long time w no success.  Think I found one. By all means go."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. They have dishes that are super good then others that were disappointing. There beef is super good. You can tell its nice quality and they cook it to perfection every time. We havent liked any of there breaded chicken yet. Perhaps it's because we get it delivered but the portions are HUGE. I would recommend this place. Its a good price for pretty good food."}
{"text":"Start with service, very fast, and very friendly, food was served fast. The portions where correct, The dining room was clean and bright. My meal was very good."}
{"text":"This is a nice little restaurant. Great for a date night. The food and portion sizes are good. 
They have a lunch buffet but the selection is limited. They charge by the container so fill it up!"}
{"text":"Pretty run of the mill American Chinese food. Surprised it's been received so well. Went in for the buffet. Service was good, it's clean, and actually quite nice inside. Just can't see how the food here is any different from pretty much any other Chinese restaurant in Berea or in almost any surrounding city, really. Meats seem to be cooked/deep fried plain and then the sauce is added in after it's been cooked. Just not my idea of good food."}
{"text":"Best spring rolls I've had in my entire life! Have not tried much else on their menu besides the stir fried veggies and Kung Pao but those have been amazing as well.  

Service is fast and prices are reasonable for the large amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Do not recommend this restaurant. Fried rice was tasty. But, overall meal was not to my liking. The egg drop soup had corn in it....which was weird. Then the meat in my Mongolian beef did not taste like normal beef, unsure how it was prepared or possibly they used processed meat.  The service was good though, the price was low, and nothing was wrong with my meal or my order. But, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Today was a first for me at Little Hong Kong - I got delivery. The woman that answered the phone was very polite. I ordered 2 Orange Chicken lunch specials (Fried Rice, Egg roll, and Orange Chicken and a side order of Crab Ragoons. I was told the delivery would be about an hour which I thought was a little steep but it is Chinese/Filipino afterall. (Quality takes longer) 

The delivery man came at about 50 minutes which was sooner then the estimated time and he was very cordial and friendly! (One of the nicest I've had in a while, even called me by name through out conversation.) He was asking me for prices on some of my units (Storage facility) and telling me what he's paying now is too much. Needless to say he has excellent customer service and I'm sorry I didn't get his name. 

Alas, the food. The fried rice is uh-mazing! It's so great I couldn't even spell a-mazing correctly! The egg roll has more of a spring roll and was packed with all the right veggies, it was a little heavy on the garlic - imo. (But still very good). The Crab ragoons are good as well. I'll admit I was a little scared because they weren't shaped like others but as they say looks can be deceiving. For the grand finale, I always save the best for last was the orange chicken, sadly, I was let down. The breading on the chicken was not crispy (as the menu dictates) and the sauce doesn't have much flavor. This is the only reason why I gave 4 out of 5 stars because the main entree was not great. I will state, however, that I'll definitely be back to try out more items on their menu especially now that I see they have lumpia!"}
{"text":"originally, we were looking to go to the Brown Derby Roadhouse next door but after looking at the menu and prices, decided to check out something else. after reading the reviews we decided to try Little Hong Kong.
we were greeted nicely and sat down to check out the menu. since it was a new place i decided to go with a \"known commodity\" and ordered General Tso's chicken. Danielle got the chicken w/ garlic sauce. We also shared an order of Crab Rangoon. each dinner started with a cup of soup (hot and sour, egg drop or wonton). we chose the wonton and we both thought it was damned good. i should also mention that they gave us a bowl of chow mein type noodles and what looked like duck sauce for dipping. a nice touch that neither of us had ever had anywhere else.
dinner came and Danielle liked hers. Mine was good but was different than most General Tso's chicken i've had elsewhere. it was a lighter (in color), and sweeter sauce than i'm used to. Good, just different. 
If we lived closer i'm sure we'd check out LHK again. We may anyway. It's certainly worth a try and I kinda wish i could check out the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and decided to try this place...the lunch buffet is so small compared to those I've had elsewhere...food was \"ok\" at best with only 4 main items and the basics...wasn't the worst I've had but far from the best \"buffet\" either. I'm continuing my search for a great Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Tasty Chinese food, the price is good restaurant is clean and well maintained, if I do Chinese food I always come to this spot. The woman that I believe owns the place is always nice and is always working hard in and out of the kitchen. They do have lunch specials and a buffet."}
{"text":"I wish I could do 3.5, but they were very nice and order was done quickly, so I'll bump up to a 4. Ordered an hour before closing, unfortunately they do not deliver.
Crab Rangoon: quite greasy, but nice flavor and fried crispy
Egg drop soup: a bit thick for my liking, but great flavor, lots of nicely thin egg, no big gross chunks
Beef w/ broccoli: good flavor, lots of beef, lots of fresh broccoli and carrots.
Chicken lo mein: good flavor, lots of tender chicken and vegetables, they really packed a lot into the carton
Chicken fried rice: bland and dry. Needed to add soy sauce
Teriyaki beef on a stick: 3 pieces, but excellent flavor, very tender, not chewy or dry, large slices of beef
Vegetable spring roll: very greasy, good size, decent flavor

Overall I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"I normally go out of my way to find a good Chinese mean, but I recently stumbled a cross this place. Their food amount is more than I would have expected from a single business, which makes this place even more appealing to come too.  I'm in love with the pork fried rice and the crab ragons. Me and my college friends come here a lot now."}
{"text":"Confession: this is my husband and I's third time eating here in the past three weeks.  The food is THAT GOOD.  As others have commented, it comes off as a \"mall food\" feel, but boy are looks deceiving.

This is my husband and my favorite Chinese food place to date in the cleveland area.  We love the general tsos chicken and lo mein.  The soups are delicious and served with fresh green onions.  

The lunch buffet is very fresh and the servers are prompt to fix any issues in the food.  For example, they made us fresh rice and noodles even though we were clearly the last ones to eat at the buffet.

We will definitely be coming back for more!  What a great find!"}
{"text":"Nice,clean,friendly staff!! It is a bit small buffet but food is great! very close to me !! Very cheap but very good food! You can also get a styrofoam container fill it and make sure the lid closes for a super price!! Matter of fact a friend and I are going to lunch there tomorrow! favorite chinese !! Dinners to go are also great!!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for years.  The lunch buffet is excellent and at a great price.  The food is always fresh and the service is outstanding.  You will love this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just to update my original review... 5 years later... still the best around... clean place, great quality, fresh, hot, I couldn't ask for more in North Ridgeville."}
{"text":"BIG smiles at Little Hong Kong!! Best Chinese lunch buffet around!! Smaller selection, but super fresh / replenished and perfect choice of staple items.  
Service is superb & very friendly. 
Extremely clean and trendy updated decor! 
Most honorable - you can tell they take pride in their livelihood.  
Can't say enough about this place that's why we go about once a month & been there like 15x. 
Plus it costs less than a chipotle bowl!! Crazy."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is small but affordable and the food is rock solid. I love the black pepper chicken, best around"}
{"text":"The food here is actually not bad! I was impressed for the price I paid, what I actually got. The food is flavorful and presented very nicely. I also enjoy that I get to keep the container as Tupperware when I am done eating. Thanks little Hong Kong!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on Saturday afternoon, we had never been here before.  The restaurant was nice and clean and the servers where very friendly. I
always order hot and sour soup and Kung pao chicken when trying some place new.  The soup was pretty good, I would order it again for sure. The Kung pao was good but I wished it was spicer. I ordered it 3 star but it didn't taste much beyond 1. Other than not being spicy the dish was still good. 
They do offer a lunch buffet for 5.95. I think I read they offer it Monday through Saturday 11-4. There were several entrees, rice, egg rolls and dessert. Not a bad deal if you are really hungry or feeding a family.
I would go back again."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the area by far! Great food, beautiful presentation, great decor and a very friendly staff. We will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"The veggie lo mein is my favorite! Roast pork fried rice is good also. Nice place with good prices."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas. I have to stop here. I can not have gluten and they are so good at letting me know what to have or they will make me somthing special that is gluten free. It always taste so fresh and yummy. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is our go-to takeout spot. Wish they delivered to Avon! Always fresh and tasty. I recommend the lo mein and especially the egg rolls. Everything seems to be seasoned well and hot upon the time we eat it. Yum!"}
{"text":"For the price this place is decent, I wouldn't say the food is bad by any means but it could definitely use some help in some areas. The fried rice is tasty but lacks some bbq pork or some other kind of protein for me. The orange chicken is quite tasty and the flavor is good. The egg flour soup is mediocre at best, i've definitely had better. The service isn't great but it isn't awful either, they could be a bit more attentive. They were good about getting our order taken quickly and the food came out in a timely manner. but once we were served our main dish we didn't see the staff again for a little while. Usually I expect that they at least come back within10 mins of serving the food to ask how things are or to check for refills and clear the table of the empty dishes. They did none of that. On the upside they do deliver on the base, which for me is a bonus. I think in the future that if I did choose this place again that I would order out and take it home or have it delivered."}
{"text":"Good food if they get your order right. The staff is very rude and orders are messed up most of the time. They also never get my address right and end up having to call me to get it again."}
{"text":"Came in tonight during a business trip from California. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken Combination Plate and it was delightful! We came in around 9:00pm and it was slow but that did not effect the quality of our service. Excellent food and excellent service made for a great evening."}
{"text":"QUALITY,  NOT QUANTITY

Small buffet, but quality.  I don't like Chinese buffets because it's usually 1,000 items of crappy food. 

Even though we arrived toward the end of lunch hour, they continued to replenish the food with fresh, hot items

Good crab rangoon with plenty of filling.  Egg rolls don't have that cheesy institutional taste.  Yummy.  

I wish they would put up a sign informing guests to take a clean plate for second trips.  I thought everyone knew that rule but apparently not."}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup is very good. Mongolian beef was good also.  Very good service."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but the place is kinda dirty. The only thing that really bugged me was the fact that the cooks were extra loud with their personal conversation, we couldn't even hear each other. I'm Filipino and understand the language (surprising because I look white) but it's pretty rude when people speak another language around people that don't speak it- (Just like when you get your nails done at a nail salon) The restaurant had two other families there eating and not only was it rude but it was distracting how loud the cooks were. I'm sorry, but nobody cares about you wanting to put a muzzle on your dog, talk about that nonsense using an inside voice! For real!"}
{"text":"Little Hong Kong has quickly become our favorite take out place in N. Ridgeville. The food is always hot, fresh, and tasty.  The staff is friendly and our order is always correct. 

Little Hong Kong also offers a sit down restaurant and a lunch buffet that is open every day except for Sunday. I've had the buffet a few times and it is delicious. It is a smaller buffet but for $5.99 (drink not included, water is free), it is perfect. They mix up a few of the entrees but always have soup, general tso's chicken, chicken w/broccoli and sweet and sour chicken. All are delicious!

I highly recommend the chicken chow mei fun from their menu. It's a large portion and easily shareable."}
{"text":"Very friendly and polite staff. Food was prepared quickly and was great. Definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone near Nellis. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"This is the cleanest restaurant around. Lunch is awesome. Supper is spectacular.  They do a great job and so friendly and accommodating. Middleburg Heights has a restaurant to be very proud of."}
{"text":"Not happy that they do not offer the buffet on Saturday anymore!  Also it seems like their quality is becoming a bit spottier.  I have given them a lot of business!  Step it up, gang!"}
{"text":"Ordered Beef brocolli the single mans food.  When I ordered my food the LHK representative told me that I couldn't get my food till I ordered $15 worth of food for delivery.  I then ordered the chicken teriyaki on a stick which come to 18.++.  My food comes and it's not enough.  Pay such high price for little food.  Sorry, have no pictures available but will on the next round.  I'll give them another chance and if they don't do better then i'm not going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! All the food was fresh on the buffet and the selection was very good. Price was fabulous! Interior was new, clean and inviting! I would definitely go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"First timers-
We loved everything!
General Tso Chicken - tender plump pieces of chicken!
(NOT the chewy stringy, scraps some places serve)
Excellent, fresh Egg Drop Soup, crispy EggRoll, and Coconut Chicken. 
All Excellent!
Wonderful and attentive staff."}
{"text":"The food was so-so, the restaurant was clean, but the service lacked a bit.  When we are one of three total tables in the place you'd think service would be on point... Nope.  I had the sesame chicken and my love had the beef with scallops.  My dish was wonderful!  Tender chicken, good flavor- the only thing negative I could say is that it wasn't very warm.  I tried some of the beef and it was very flavorful, tender, and the assorted veggies on that plate were crisp .  We had pot sticker dumplings and egg drop soup as well and both were good.  This isn't a place I'd go out of my way to visit, but every now and again when craving Chinese food I wouldn't be opposed to stopping in again.  It's especially close to base- so that's a plus, as well!"}
{"text":"We ordered food to go few days ago and it took about almost an hour for it to be cooked! 

Ordered salt n pepper shrimp which is the only think that I liked with all our orders. Its not like the best thing but it was better than everything else. 

DO NOT get the honey walnut shrimp because the walnut is so stale!!! It tasted so bitter and you can taste the oiliness of the walnut and how old it is. 

We also ordered some pork chops and its okay. I didnt bother eating the other gigantic egg roll they have because of dissatisfaction! 

Overall I dont think I want to come back here again. It was just a last minute thing because its close to my friends house."}
{"text":"Little Hong Kong is off our list of places to go. The General Tso chicken is now made with a sweet orange sauce instead of the dark sweet spicy sauce it used to serve.  The hot and sour soup was the best ever a couple of months ago. When i went back recently it must have been made by someone else without the skill of the previous chef."}
{"text":"Called at 4:30 to have it delivered, but delivery driver wasn't available until 6pm. So, I ordered to pick up. Everything was amazing! Well worth picking up. I got an Orange Chicken dinner for one which comes with choice of one of their soups, you also get an egg roll, crab Rangoon (which I think is just cream cheese inside fried breading) and chicken fried rice. So delicious and serving size is accurate for the cost. $8.95 + tax. I'm not from the area, so choosing a dining place that has good food is a shot in the dark and I hit the target. Lol. I favorited this place and will definitely order again next time I'm in town. As some of my review readers know, I am a tough critic and don't tread lightly when saying how I feel about an experience or product, so I am happy to be able to give Little Hong Kong a great review as they have earned it."}
{"text":"Update: I'm not sure why I thought that this place was opened just this year. It seems that they have actually been open for a couple of years now. I guess it's because we have been so disappointed with other Chinese takeout in the area that we just hadn't been eating Chinese food at all (except for occasionally King Wah, but that's another review). We are regulars now. 

So this means that they have kept the restaurant very clean. Most Chinese restaurants that I've experienced would be filthy by now."}
{"text":"Gist time visitor, stopped by after reading Yelp reviews. 

Delicious General Tso's. The chicken was tender and cooked perfectly. Sauce was just right. They also provided some noodle chips and duck sauce before the meal arrived which was a nice touch. 

Service was extremely efficient and pleasant. Very clean and well kept location. Delicious food. Will be returning for the buffet."}
{"text":"Tremendous restaurant. Extremely clean and inviting. Very friendly staff. I ordered chicken lo mein and asked for it to be made spicy. It was perfect! Just enough kick to get you sweating but not too much to take away from the flavor. Vegetables taste fresh and crisp. Chicken was plentiful. I will definitely be back. Anyone should definitely give this restaurant a chance. I promise they will earn your future business."}
{"text":"Ever since we moved to Cleveland we have been looking for a place to for Chinese carry out. This place is the best place in the Westside by far."}
{"text":"Average to good Americanized Chinese food. You know the drill.  I rarely indulge in Asian cuisine outside the Spring Mtn area. But sometimes you find yourself on the other side of town and just need a quick bite. Little Hong Kong hit the spot. The vegetables were crisp and fresh, the portions hearty. The friendly and attentive service earned the crew a third star. The in-house menu contains a page of Filipino specialties. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Grabbed take-out on a Tuesday night.  Like the layout of the place, but there was no one eating in the dining room.

My food was ready when I walked in, and my order was correctly filled (something that people who eat Chinese food enough would appreciate).

As for the food itself...I've had better.  The crab rangoon has a plastic taste/texture, and my General Tso's was over-breaded and terribly soggy...and I know it's not the best for take-out, but it wouldn't have been that tasty even when fresh.

The egg roll was okay, and the hot & sour soup was pretty good.

This is a bit of drive, and I'm not sure it will be worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Great little spot for quick lunch,
Hot and fresh
Good selection of staple items
Always a hit
Great value for money"}
{"text":"I went here because it was close and the yelp ratings were good.  What a learning experience this was.  A huge disappointment.  The chicken was dry, the fried shrimp had breading that was three times the size of the shrimp, dense and overcooked,  The chow mein was so-so but the beef an chicken in it was also overcooked and stringy.  I will never go back and I will be more careful in judging Yelp stars."}
{"text":"This is the first time that we tried Little Hong Kong, based on the previous Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. The food was great and the price was right."}
{"text":"This is seriously the best Chinese food around. While I've never tried to lunch buffet myself, I've recommended this place to many friends who have tried it and have said it's amazing. I get take out here 1-3 times a month, and I have yet to be disappointed. The food is always fresh and smells delicious (it has me salivating the whole drive home). The inside of the restaurant is super clean and the employees are always ridiculously nice and friendly. I absolutely love going here and will recommend this place to any and all, this is a must eat."}
{"text":"I was at Little Hong Kong this evening and it was wonderful. It is super clean and food was hot tasty and fresh. My server was super friendly and chatted to me because I was the only person there. I figure the time of year had something to do with that because it was great. I had the Singapore noodles and won ton soup. I knew from the minute I got the soup this place was going to be solid. Please give this place a try if you're a Chinese fan."}
{"text":"Such a gem of a restaurant. The dining area is clean and very updated, with cute and trendy decor. The hostess was very kind and attentive, and the food very delicious and fresh. At the end of our meal, we even got a complimentary piece of the best mango mousse dessert I've ever had. Prices are very inexpensive, and lots of options for vegetarians. Definitely will be visiting here again!"}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to Yelp during a move for my mother to this area.  We got a huge spread for a big hungry family.  Let me just say that the entire family was just expecting some \"American Chinese\" to satisfy a hunger like ordering \"Pizza\" from Papa Johns...wow were we pleasantly surprised!  Every single person said \"Wow this is really good\".  Considering this covered a huge variety of dishes I say it's good all around.  Everything was PERFECTLY cooked and fresh.  No overcooked chicken, beef or shrimp.  Veggies retained a beautiful crunch and the meat was super juicy.  On top of that the flavors were spot on.  I dare say this is one of the best Chinese restaurants I have eaten at and I have eaten A LOT!  (NYC, SAN FRAN, Chicago, Houston, DC)  Do yourself a favor and make a long trek out here and try it.  If this place was in China Town Cleveland it would own."}
{"text":"I've tried so many Chinese restaurants on the west side & this by far is my favorite. The restaurant is SO clean & the decor is nice. The employees are very nice! 

Okay, on to the food...
My sister & I ordered the chicken lo mein, sweet & sour chicken, veggie fried rice, & spring rolls. Everything we ordered was good! The sweet & sour chicken is all white meat & the chicken is crispy. The sauce was on the side since we got it to go. The chicken lo mein & fried were very tasty as well. You definitely get your money's worth here because I think you get a pretty decent portion for the price. For four items, the total was less than $30.

I'll be back again for sure & I'll have to try their lunch buffet one day soon."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese restaurant in Ridgeville. It doesn't matter if the food is for there or to go, it's always fresh."}
{"text":"Some of the best Asian food I have ever had. I ordered the scallops and hot garlic sauce and it was phenomenal. My wife had the chicken Lo mein and enjoyed it as well. The staff here is super nice and helpful. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"When I moved to North Ridgeville about a year and a half ago, I wasn't sure of where to order good Chinese food from. I saw an ad in the mail about Little Hong Kong and decided to try it out. Needless to say, I haven't had any other Chinese in the area because this is so good. Always fast service, even if you order there and wait."}
{"text":"Probably the cleanest Chinese restaurant in the world! Food is great, comes fast, fresh and tastes great. I have not tried the buffet but will be back for the same."}
{"text":"Very cheap and tasty with friendly service. You won't get blown away by the food but it's very much worth it."}
{"text":"I give these folks no stars. Not the food, Not the delivery, but the process.  Made an order on the phone and used my credit card. Next day noticed that my name, full credit card number, Expiration date, CVV written on the receipt that they had a copy of. If I had not looked at the piece of paper and tossed it or maybe the wind blew it away when the driver was delivering anything can happen and it been my experience that it is not a good business practice if someone could have all the information needed for credit card fraud exposed so easily. I went by the store to inquire about the process and they had no idea it was or could be a problem. That being said if you order from these business Neanderthals do not give them your credit  card information. If you value your credit card information don't let the ineptitude of these neophytes have it because they will not protect it. The criminals love businesses like this and are going through their trash looking for old receipts and selling the information to the dark web."}
{"text":"Not as good now no lunch buffet I won't go back rice tasted weird don't waste you money"}
{"text":"LHK is conveniently located near Nellis Air Force Base. I think they have actually very recently opened and I thought I could give them a try on my lunch break. You have the option of dining in, taking out and delivery. They have a lunch menu with most items around $6.50. I ordered the Mongolian Beef for me and the Kang Pao chicken for my husband. They both came with egg roll, vegetable fried rice and the choice of soup or salad. They actually have a salad bar in there, which is not too fancy and still nice. The food was actually pretty good or better than all the places I have been to in North Las Vegas. Since this place is so close to my work I am sure I will be going back there soon again."}
{"text":"Very tasty food at a very reasonable price. We are remodeling our kitchen, and have been odering foods from this restaurant in the past few days. Everyone in the family loves the food."}
{"text":"I used to love this place especially since it is so close to my house. I'm hardly a complainer btw BUT I'm giving it a 2 star rating because their quality has went down drastically. I chose delivery.. they told me it would be an hour to get my food when I could walk there in about 7 minutes. So I ordered a combo appetizer for one, beef chow mein and a side order of crab rangoons. Everything fried tasted absolutely gross like old oil. I felt robbed of my money but was hungry and in a hurry to get to work. So sad."}
{"text":"Today I thought I would try Little Hong Kong again.  My 1st experience left me feeling neglected by the staff and the food portions were off between my husbands and I.  His Orange chicken was enough to feed two and my Lemon chicken was a very thin small chicken cutlet.  But sometimes a off nite happens so I wasn't ready to rule them out.  Today I left with the same feeling of neglect.  The staff while ordering and bring the food was very attentive and friendly but after the main dish was served disappeared behind the counter to play on the internet.  Our soup dishes were never cleaned off the table and we had to wait for a refill or our drinks.  Today I tried the Beef and Broccoli and although the beef was tender and veggies crisp they were very very bland.  I did like the fried rice but think I will go elsewhere for my next craving for Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Visited the lunch buffet today with four teens, everything was still excellent!  The restaurant was clean and all the food was very tasty.  Since my last visit they have added chicken wings and fried wonton's to the buffet.  Both of these new additions were very good.  For $5.95 you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Ive been here several times and they have been fairly consistent with their quality of food. Love the lettuce wrap. Definetly a go to place for chinese and filipino food. They have all the staple filipino food like lumpia and pancit. There serving is really big too. If your hungry, check this place out."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was sooo good. Their lunch buffet is only $5.95 and it's very delicious. I especially loved their General Tso's chicken and their wonton soup. Such a great deal for so many different food options. They also have dessert. They were constantly bringing out new food too which was nice.

The inside was very nice and clean. Very modern style that had an upscale feel. They are located in a plaza with many other businesses. Make sure you come hungry because you will leave feeling very full! Great spot for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was fast, and the restaurant was very clean. 
I got the general tso chicken. It was a little to sweet for me liking but still very good. My wife got the kung pao chicken and that was really good. Both said spicy on the menu but they were about as spicy and ketchup. 
Price was competitive and quantity was great. 
Egg rolls were big but a little on the greasy side, not unexpected. 
Overall, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really clean and pleasant to dine in.  Super friendly employees.  The food is really good in the typical American Chinese way. Lunch buffet is priced just right.  We usually get take out and learned that they give you a lot of food and we often share main dishes."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the people are pleasant. I had the mandarin shrimp and chicken fried rice.  My son had the had sesame chicken which he enjoyed.  My husband had the dragon and Phoenix but he did not like the sauce and was able to change it for the mandarin sauce without any hassle.  I love good customer service!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese Food restaurant around. Great service. Very clean. The lady that works there is super sweet and always smiling. 7 stars!"}
{"text":"So I hope the food is good because the service sucks. I sat down for a to go order. It took 20 minutes to place my order and another 25 minutes to get it. One waitress and one cook. All the tables were dirty and there were only Five other people in the place. Don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Excelente Food, fast delivery, great service. Nothing better after a long day traveling...."}
{"text":"I went in today and got the buffet to go! Although small compared to other buffets it was very good! Usually I have the sweet and sour chicken from the menu but I tried a bunch of stuff today and now I like the beef with mushrooms better! Will try again for sure!"}
{"text":"God I love this place. it's one of those mom and pop restaurants where it is better to pay cash. The food was delicious especially for what they were charging. There's plenty of free parking. And the lady who was running the place was very cordial. It was a very nice dining atmosphere. My only complaint was that there was a lady/customer in there eating at a different table who was kind of crazy. I couldn't tell if she was coming on to me or if she was hinting that she was a hooker. An older lady too."}
{"text":"Being new to the area we gave this place a whril and fortunately we loved it. The sweet & sour chicken was tasty and the wong ton soup was delicious.  They didn't skimp on won tons - we got 10! We'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Called in an Oder and it was ready in 15 mins. No waiting! I ordered Sesame Shrimp and it was okay. Next time I will try a different dish!"}
{"text":"Amazing food decent service very good Chinese food only problem was took a little to refill the lunch plates"}
{"text":"My second time here..ugh! no AC and it's summer! the food here can use  little bit of seasoning and just salt! Go some place else and spend your money in other \"chinese\" fast food."}
{"text":"I've had the food several times.  Nice portions.  Quick service.  I especially like the honey chicken and the pepper steak."}
{"text":"I live in Olmsted Falls and it has been an adventure trying to find a decent Chinese restaurant (went through 4 of them already) and found this one based off one review by Terry B here on yelp. I have to say, he is spot on. Had the Hot & Sour soup which was amazing minus a few too much tofu, but the flavor was amazing. The crab rangoon were crispy and flavorful with real crab taste. I had the General Tso Chicken, which could have been a little spicier, but had a good flavor. The egg rolls were huge and tasty as well.  The fried rice was very fresh (not sitting around for hours like other places) and didn't even need any soy sauce for flavor. I will definitely patronize LHK again and hopefully again and again and again. Thanks again Yelp for recommending some good stuff."}
{"text":"Add this Chinese place to your rotation, another good option in town!

Take out is always good, and portions are huge! The crab rangoons are awesome, so is the pork lo mien and boneless spare ribs if that is your sort of thing. This is heavy and greasy Chinese food at its finest but is always a good treat on a rainy day once in a while! Also, check out their $5.95 lunch buffet, even on weekends!"}
{"text":"*sigh* Sundays are a little sadder because Little Hong Kong is closed on Sundays. Honestly, if LHK is closed, we don't eat Chinese. Great Chinese is amazing, bad Chinese will ruin your night. LHK never disappoints. The food here is great, but the service is amazing. We have ordered in store and over the phone and the service is always upbeat and friendly. But heres what puts it over the top for me...I don't know if they've done this for anyone else ( though I like to think its just me) they've thrown in little extras. Once when we came in the lady taking our order was talking with my little one and she threw in a free soda for him, he was thrilled. And they've done other little things like that on other occasions as well...now don't go asking for free stuff because you read my review,  I'm not vouching for that! Once again I like to think this was done because I'm super special! LOL  Or maybe it could just be because they really enjoy their customers and they enjoy what they do.  

The dining room of the restaurant is REALLY NICE so don't hesitate to eat in. They also have a lunch buffet that I've gotten on two separate occasions and the food was fresh and hot. Now we've relocated to Parma this is our favorite Chinese food restaurant hands-down."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food.

I define value as Experience - Cost and Little Hong Kong was a great value.

As a traveling salesman from NY who lives in WV and travels through OH, KY and PA I enjoyed this restaurant.

I ordered Crab Ragoons, Boneless Spare Ribs with Brown rice combo and it was good. I won't say it was the best I ever had but it was good for a great price for what you get. I took it to go because I had a lot of work to do in my hotel room but the atmosphere was great and very inviting.

Overall it's just Chinese food but when you want a better quality Chinese food that doesn't keep you in the bathroom all night than Little Hong Kong is the place."}
{"text":"Little Hongkong. I pretty much call it Little Philippines.  The quality of service is really good. And the workers are very nice."}
{"text":"This is my preferred Chinese take-out in N. Ridgeville, but they don't deliver (prefer China King for delivery, but Little HK is better overall).  They have a lunch buffet which is usually pretty popular, although the seating inside is limited.  Friendly, good prices, and conveniently located near the Giant Eagle.  This is the one we recommend to our friends and family in the area."}
{"text":"We moved to this side of town on Saturday, and we passed by Little Hong Kong on  every trip over to the apartment.  

On Saturday afternoon, after moving all day long, we decided that we didn't want to cook, so we ordered Chinese for delivery!

First and foremost:  the lady on the phone was SUPER nice.  She was polite, repeated my order back, and gave me more info on some of the dishes I was unsure about.   They offer a military discount (being so close to the base), which was nice, since my fella is a veteran.  

The food arrived very promptly.  We were told about an hour, and it was just a bit under that time frame.  

The delivery man was also very nice, very polite.  

As far as the food goes, it was ok!!  Its really difficult to find REALLY good Chinese food in town. We ordered:
Egg Rolls:  Not really egg rolls.  The were spring rolls.  While they were tasty, the inside was a bit mushy, which is something we've seen pretty commonly out here. 
Imperial Egg Rolls:  GREASY.  But really delicious!  These are enormous egg rolls with chicken, pork, and shrimp inside.  The meat was cooked and seasoned well, but there were no veggies, and they dripped grease.  Still damned tasty!
Crab Rangoon:  REALLY good.   Really really.  Plenty of filling, and the wonton part was nice and crispy. 

Mongolian beef:  The website said \"hot\" and they weren't kidding, which was a little off putting with Mongolian beef.  The beef itself was tender, and delicious, but this was too spicy for me.  Fella commented that the sauce was a little runny, and there were way too many onions.  

Almond chicken:  One word:  YUM.  This was spot on.  Tender delicious chicken.  Baby corns, green celery, flavorful sauce...this was excellent.  We'd order from here again JUST for this.  

All in all, as first experiences go, this was a good one!  I can't wait to try out more items from the menu.  

Thanks a lot Little Hong Kong!"}
{"text":"Tried To order from China kitchen first, but they don't deliver to base. Th e efood from here is delicious, but the price is outrageous. It's a LOT of food too, which I'm not complaining about. Their egg rolls tho, at first I thought \"this isn't an eggroll, this is a damn burrito, but they're absolutely amazing, 3 inches thick, 5 inches long. God chow moen, it was awesome,.got seafood delight, delicious.  3 stars because it so expensive! Would eat here again tho!!"}
{"text":"We love Hunan and Szechuan cuisine and had it across the U.S., Canada, Central America, and Europe.   If you want it to have heat that you would expect from the Hunan and Szechuan cuisines this is not the place for it.  If you like the sweetness of  Cantonese cuisine this is probably a good spot for you."}
{"text":"Yes great food, service equally good, enough attention for me -a glass of water, napkins and good place to sit, I'm easy to please. The singapore chowmein  was made perfectly, veggies still crips, prawns still tender cooked to perfection. 

next trip, I'm back!

Great work LHK!"}
{"text":"We went here on Friday based on the Yelp reviews and we enjoyed our experience. The waitress was nice and the food was hot and fresh. We will be back."}
{"text":"I would say that this place is awesome! I suggest that you try it out for yourselves but my experience over all here was great! My boyfriend and I ordered the pork fried rice, chicken lettuce wraps and one more something spicy but i forgot. They serve huge amount of food which is good if you're eating with someone or a group. The taste was AWESOME! Service was fast and good too :) I took a picture of Lettuce wrap and added it on here. I didn't get a chance to take a picture of our first 2 orders. We killed it even before I had the chance.

I would definitely come back here with more of my friends for the next time I visit Las Vegas! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and pricing!  Our meals were delicious and there was plenty to take home afterwards.  Easy access to here.  Nice and clean restaurant and restrooms.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"General chicken was the star of this restaurant.. the service was great and the lunch buffet was very affordable , less than 6 dollars and although there was a small selection.. it was really good"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet, like 20 or so items. Lunch buffet and drink was under $10. Decent sized dining room. Full menu available too."}
{"text":"2 things that are nice about delivery here (I've never visited the actual location).. 1) the woman taking my order was nice and she was understanding when I called back realizing I forgot to mention a coupon listed on the site. She offered to use the discounted amount (because she already ran my card) as the tip for the driver, which was fine with me. 2) you get a decent amount of food.

Cons..
1) the food wasn't great at all, so although I got a lot of it, most of it will be wasted.
2) took an hour and 15 minutes for the food to arrive.

I'm very disappointed because the hotel where I'm staying has menus out for this restaurant. I assumed that meant something.."}
{"text":"I've Been Ordering Here For Over A Year ! Always Awesome Hot Food Even If Delivery Takes An Hour ! I Had A Problem Only Once But It Was Fixed Asap ! I Love This Place Soooo Much. The Salt And Pepper Wings Are To Die For ! They Charge A Fair Price For The Amount Of Food You're Getting And It's All Very Good. I Wish They Had Another Driver But Sadly There's Only 1. I Love Him ! He Calls Me Sis And Asks About My Kids Everytime He Sees Me. Thanks ! Keep Up The Good Work !"}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday.  The buffet is $6.95 I think.  That's really hard to beat.  

The restaurant is located in a strip mall and is nice and clean inside.  I've eaten here several times over the past couple years mainly because of the cost.  And the amount and quality of food on the buffet.  There is soup, chinese ribs, several chicken dishes to pick from (chicken and mushroom, sweet and sour chicken, etc.), noodles, rice, desserts.  It's not the best food I've ever had.  But it's not the worst I've had either.  

Before yesterday I would have given this place 3 out of 5 stars.  Yesterday the food I got off the buffet was lukewarm to cold.  I couldn't eat the food.  I was afraid I might get sick.  I told someone working there the food was cold on the buffet.  She told me I can request to have the food heated up in a microwave if it isn't hot enough.  Huh.  That's a new one.

I'll likely try this place again as I've eaten here a lot over the past couple years and not had the food temp issue I had yesterday.  If it corrects itself next time I'l update my review accordingly.  If it doesn't I may not go back at all.  I really don't want to get sick."}
{"text":"Just found this restaurant and I love it! It's very clean and quiet inside. The food is fantastic and prepared very well for take out. So far all the items I've ordered have been very tasty I'll keep coming back. Prices are also very good compared to others who charge more for average food."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today... Had Chicken Egg Foo Young and Shrimp Fried Rice... The Fried rice was edible, nothing to brag about. However the Chicken Egg Foo Young I was HIGHLY disappointed in... much of the outside parts were burnt. I tried mixing the gravy in and some of the rice to mask it, but it didn't work. Wish I could give a better review. Maybe some other time."}
