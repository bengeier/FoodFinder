{"text":"Good food and drinks, interesting fusion menu. If you're starving I'd suggest getting two things. Splitting is the best option. I've been 3 times and have had the same waiter each time. Went for a bday recently and this waiter danced and sang instead of listening to our orders so we had to patiently wait for him to finish his performance every time he came to the table. He kindly offered us bday shots but then joked about putting heroine in them. When he brought them to the table he then joked that he'd put Roofies in them which wasn't very appropriate to say to a table of 5 women. He was also very clearly \"on something\". When we were leaving he then apologized for his behaviour and said it was his first service as a waiter and so he's still learning. Like I said earlier, he's been my waiter 3 times now so not only was that a lie but I've been told he's one of the partners. I'm going to compliment sandwich here though and say that this is a chill spot to watch the game if you're not into the sports bar thing."}
{"text":"cool place and cool ambiance!!!

fusion japanese food.great add on to the hood."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. Fun vibe and friendly staff who were very accommodating for a friends birthday. They also were very good about some severe food allergies. The food was good, you just need to ask about portions because it isn't obvious what should be a meal and what should be an appetizer."}
{"text":"Went with hubby and friends and we split a bunch of bao buns and other appetizers to sample a bunch of items. We sampled nearly all the bao buns (all were great), as were the ribs appetizer. A bit overpriced (~$12 for two bao buns, where each is about 3 bites) but the ambiance is nice (dim lighting, candlelight) and perfect for dates and small groups. My go-to Asian-style tapas place is imadake but sometimes you don't want to deal with the sheer noise of the place -- Cho's food is not as varied, but the lower decibels (it is still loud because it's crowded, but it's not a partying/yelling loudness) and fun atmosphere makes for a good compromise. Note there is no advertised dessert menu -- but there are several options if you ask. We got a skillet cookie (hot and fresh out of the oven!) with ice cream and it really hit the spot!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my meal at Cho. The tuna tartare is a must have, as are the pork belly buns. The grilled sambal shrimp bao buns and korean short ribs were delicious too! 

The staff was very attentive which added to our experience. Can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"This was my second visit after a great experience more than a year ago. Happy to say that Cho is as good as ever. We were three, two of us from Toronto. I thoroughly enjoyed the Orchid cocktail while my companions shared Sake. We decided on sharing small plates and not a single one disappointed, They arrived in at a leisurely pace with not too long a gap between them as is often the case in other similar establishments. Salmon tartare was very flavourful but what made it special was the tempura base, adding texture as well. Popcorn shrimp were crisp and spicy - delicious. Most outstanding were the buttermilk fried chicken Bao Buns; we wanted seconds! The interior is simple, tables against the window alongside a bar. When we arrived at 7:30, the crowd was more family but by the time we left the bar stools were full and along with the good, not too loud music, the vibe was young and hip. Definitely plan to return soon!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner at Cho! I wasn't sure about trying it because of the mixed reviews, but I'm so glad we did. We had a great birthday dinner. 

The cocktails were amazing! We loved the bao buns, and strongly recommend the chicken. Mmmmm. The kamikaze tartar was incredible. We also had a pork bowl which was great. A shared chocolate molten dessert was also yummy. This was enough for two people. All was recommended by our waiter, who was very friendly and helpful. We were seated in a quiet area which was private but you may want to be in the main area for a more lively experience. I see that they now have an outdoor patio (we were there in early May 2016, still too cold!)

Don't hesitate to try Cho if you're into yummy cocktails, and well-seasoned and balanced Asian fusion. I'd recommend sharing dishes so you can try more. We will be back! I'd like to try going for fun cocktails and tapas on the patio, sounds like heaven."}
{"text":"Cho has the asian fusion thing going on. It is a new resto in a part of town that is trying to develop a 2nd restaurant scene on Notre Dame to the west of the Notre Dame/Charlevoix area, Tuck Shop and Gruman's are just down the street. 

The food at Cho is interesting, tasty, nicely presented and the atmosphere s very nice. My only complaint is the price. It is pretty expensive for asian food. For example the Bao, steamed buns, were about $12 which is about twice as expensive as other places in town for a similar dish. Appetizers are in the $8 to $15 range and main dishes run $20 to $30."}
{"text":"Oui c'était très bon, mais bon cela a pris quand une petite vingtaine de minutes avant de pouvoir être installés par des serveurs qui avaient relativement hâte de prendre nos commandes et de débarrasser nos assiettes. 
Malgré cela, les plats étaient très bons et le prix assez accessible donc je donnerai des points en plus juste pour ça."}
{"text":"Pricey pub-grade food with an Asian twist. Decor is great but service is tense and slow. Cocktails are watery at best (we tried 2). 

Seriously, I don't get the appeal. 

Avoid."}
{"text":"Portion is small (spent little over $200 and still hungry. Only ordered two glasses of wine. For party of 2) 
I'm Korean (same last name as the restaurant lol) but I don't feel like none of their food is Korean.. well I told my québécois friends that Cho is Korean fusion restaurant but they deny... (this tells even the québécois doesn't see this place has any korean related) almost of their food is... make a dish and add kimchi then call it \" korean \" also, on top they use thick grounded paprika.. which it is ingredient used for most of korean dishes but they use very thick grounded... these stuck in your teeth.. I don't recommend this place for date. Smile with that big paprika on your teeth front of your date.. rofl. Even Koreans don't use this. 
The taste of food is ok... space is small. Tables are so close together... reminds me of jap Izakaya with tables so close you have to ask ppl around you to move so you can get out. I went during summer so it was okay but during winter time with winter coats.. ekk. The difference between table behind me is about three inches. And tables apart as hallway is like one ft away. Very small!! Overall, I don't recommend this place. The location is not even at nice place but over charge the food for something it's not even amazing. Also you have to be crushed with tables around you. I gave two stars bc the place is called cho and the food was eatable and clean."}
{"text":"These are the guys who were running Ginger for many years. Ergo, hip, a little on the pricey side and catering to a young, cool crowd. Bao sliders are delicious and a tad on the pricey side (if you are comparing these bao sliders to prices prior to the Momofuku upscaling influence). Food is definitely east asian fusion.  On the weekend, it's unlikely one is able to eat here if you don't reserve ahead. I wrote this short review to negate the 3 star review below. I don't think one should be giving 3 stars just because of a preconceived notion of what the price should be. It's tasty, trendy, social and the prices fit the demographic that go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food. We ordered the Bimbimbap special and I was surprised how good it was. The food was fresh and flavorful but most importantly, the sauce was spicy yet it didnt feel like I was going to need 1 gallon of water to tame the heat down. 
I knocked out one star because at the end of our dinner service, the staff kinda forgot about us and the restaurant wasn't busy. Also, maybe I am a purist but I felt akward having to ask for chopsticks.I know this is an Asian fusion restaurant, but I feel chopsticks should be part of the table setting; or at least ask the customer if they prefer to have it.

Great restaurant for small impromptu dinners and girls night outs. 
I am definetely going back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is really fun and dynamic and there's plenty of plant based options. I've been here twice and both times ordered the tofu bao buns. So delicious! 

I also ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura which is to die for. Since it's a starter I suggest sharing it with someone as it's really filling and rich.

The drinks are very original and inspired. I always order a bunch of different cocktails when I come here. 

Also the ambiance is perfect. It's low-lit, they play cool music and the acoustics in the room are perfect. Even though both times I've been here the place has been pretty bumping, I never had to yell over noise to talk to my friends. So if you're like me and can't stand noisy restaurant but still like a hip scene, this is the place to go.

Order the giant cookie with ice cream! Unless you're on a diet. It comes out hot and gooey and with so many sprinkles... I felt like a kid at a 90s birthday party. Don't try to eat it alone. Trust me. I generally don't like to share my dessert but Fat Bastard (Austin Powers) might struggle to finish this cookie. 

The only reason they are not getting five stars from me is because the last time I was there they rushed us out when our allocated two hours were up. I understand the pressures of restaurants needing to make a profit. I was once a hostess many years ago and I know that we can't linger forever but we hadn't even finished our dessert when they pretty much asked us to leave. I think they should have warned me when I made the reservation that we only had a two hour block of time to eat. Plus two hours isn't really enough time for a restaurant with such an extensive and tantalizing cocktail menu."}
{"text":"You all know how sometimes we (Celiac's) feel like a bother when we go to a restaurant and tell them we can't have gluten or how important it is that there is no cross contamination.

Yesterday we went out for our anniversary at one of our favorite restaurant ,I mention i couldn't have gluten and JEREMY(our waiter) bent over backwards and took many trip to the kitchen to ensure i could be accommodated and feel safe eating there in peace!

The food was delicious, a feast for the senses, the service was amazing and most importantly i didn't feel like i was being a pain in the ass and my concerns were taken seriously!!! 

Kudos to Jeremy and Ch? for yet an incredible experience. P.S: you could bring back the Octopus, pleeeeeeease!!!!!!

{"text":"So this is one of those restoraunts in a up and coming? gentrified areas, and it has hipster all over it! The food is OK it's not great and is not justified the price in my opinion. The staff seems to think this place is a bigger deal than it is. Good for them."}
{"text":"Good vibe and ambience but the bao is way too small . If you enjoy tapas you'd certainly enjoy this restaurant but getting your stomach fed with baos is not an option unless you're willing to drop $50 to only eat baos"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic night at Cho, their poutine is amazing (15$, so flavourful!) and their Kamikaze tuna tartare (25$) was one of the best I've had in a long time. The Bibimbap ($25) was good as well, although not as memorable. The atmosphere and location is great, service was very friendly, and drinks selection is interesting. Giving four stars only because the price for everything is steeper than it should be... I've had comparable meals in the middle of downtown Montreal for less. 12$ drinks is particularly high considering these are all small drinks. Portion sizes for meals are also very small. Overall great place for a date night, but for 2 people expect a bill of at least 120$."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. Aside from the great service, the food is delicious and very creative in its flavors. The fried chicken bao buns are a must to try.....all the other bao buns are pretty damn good as well. If you have room left the chocolate cookie and ice cream is amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome new menu, great staff, atmosphere and food! Would come back again~ great take on fusion~"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a beautiful modern, dim light decor.  It is located far out south west of downtown Montreal.  When I walked in I was greeted by the host and seated at a table near the door which is my pet peeve and I asked if I could be moved to a different table however, I was told that all other tables had been reserved.  This was definitely not the case as I stared at a vacant table that I would have rather been seated at all night.  

I ordered a lobster bao as an appetizer, which was amazing but way too small.  I could eat at least 5 of these delectable little 2 bite sandwiches and for 13$ I felt like I should have received that.  For my main dish I ordered the strip loin steak medium rare.  Not the best steak I have ever eaten however, the presentation was great and the vegetables were fresh.  My guest ordered a spicy tuna tartare which is placed on a edamame base.  She did not enjoy it at all and I gave it a taste and to me I felt it was kind of bland.  For drinks I ordered whisky sour which tasted like a whisky bitter more than a sour and the rim was not sugar coated as I am used to and enjoy.

One thing I definitely have to mention though was that the host that did seat us was really cool and fun to talk to.  He even gave us a free Sake bomb which I felt really helped us enjoy the evening!  

This place is a trendy, hipster spot with a good ambiance but is overpriced."}
{"text":"Asian fusion. We reserved ahead of time because we needed a table for 8. We were stuck in a corner just to the right of the door, so we didn't really see the whole place. The waitress was friendly, with a smile on her face. We ordered a large variety of things from the menu for everyone to try. The major problem was the pacing of the meal. The appetizers, the buns and some of the side all came out together along with one main. Then there was a long pause, I mean long, like over half an hour. When the bus boy came to clear the table because even he thought that we were done, we flagged down the waitress to inquire about the remainder of our order, She was defensive and told us it was because of the way we ordered. Finally, after about 15 more minutes, 3 more mains and 2 more sides appeared. It was really, really odd. The food however was quite good."}
{"text":"Serveur incompétent unilingue anglophone. Ultra cher pour une cuisine faite sans talent. 175$ pour trois avec 1 bière par personne. A éviter"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always go late on Tuesday or Wednesday and the staff is always happy to squeeze us in. Which we REALLY appreciate! 

We always end up taking the same thing because it's just the best. Cho Poutine (my fav Poutine in Montreal) a boa bun (different every time) and edamame.

Jeremy is normally our server and he's the best! 
He's funny, nice and great at his job! 

The decor is nice and chick nothing to fancy.
They'd got a really nice patio in the summer too.

I love how while sitting at the bar you can see them cooking in the kitchen and everything come out! 

Definitely a st-Henri gem!"}
{"text":"Food was good and so was the service. The bimbimbap could have been more authentic, but the salmon was cooked well nonetheless."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to eat at Cho not too long ago. The food was great, the ambiance was lovely, but I am giving it four stars because there is room for improvement. for instance, many of the items on the menu were on the heavier side, for the vegetable lovers and those who are health conscious, having a few tapas options that are on the healthier\greener\lighter side would be convenient! 
I also think that a discovery or tasting menu should be used. A fixed price for two people (and another for groups) to discover a few items on the menu, with appetizer, entrée, and dessert options. It would be the easy option for clients who want to try many items on the menu. Otherwise, the food was great and I'd love to see even more creative meals on that menu (Kimchi poutine anyone?)

I'd recommend eating at Cho, it was great!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place for quite some time now and been wanting to try it. We finally got the opportunity yesterday to try this restaurant and see what all the hype is about. We had a reservation and were seated quickly. We had a look at the menu which had quite a few options and everything looked delicious. It took a while until a server came to see us if we were ready to order. We decided to go with the edamame, panzanella salad, chicken bao buns and kalbi beefs. The edamame was freaking good! It came super steamy and was tasty. The panzanella salad came and I found it overpriced (16$) for a tomato , cucumber and fried bao crouton salad. It then took about another 25 minutes for us to receive our buns and kalbi beef. The buns were delicious. I definetly recommend it! The kalbi beef was okay. Overall, I'm giving this place 3 stars because there are other Asian hip restos that are much better and the service was horrible. Our waitress never came to see how we were doing and if everything was ok. She didn't even come to take our order. Another employee had to take it because she was too busy. As a next time, I would recommend they improve their service so that the experience is more personal. Other than that, the food is ok and wasn't memorable."}
{"text":"Some good dishes that don't make up for overpriced and stingy cocktails, inexperience but nice staff, and management that can't see beyond its nose. One bad review will hurt much more than having your customer leave happy. In our opinion, the food was way over salted and over sweetened. Some of the dishes were quite good, but why not use subtlety in flavouring? The edamame were so salty that they were unpleasant to eat. Inexperience staff presented a special without the type of clarification it needed and thus it was not what was expected. They offered, as a gesture, a free dessert, which we declined. When we asked for a replacement dish that cost exactly the same thing, they declined. Dumb! You can't just come on the Montreal restaurant scene with over-priced food and not be perfect. Too bad, because we thought Cho has potential, but we'll not return."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic, the food was a fusion of Asian flavors and our waiter, Jeremy, was very attentive. One diner had food allergies and the staff was very  helpful."}
{"text":"Refreshing take on Korean classics in an inviting atmosphere. Jeremy and the front of house staff accommodated our party of 11 with grace and warmth. Our party quite appreciated our 
evening at Cho's - much thanks!"}
{"text":"It's a good simple Asian fusion restaurant with a fun owner and great staff! 
They have vegetarian options which I always appreciate because my boyfriend is Vegetarian."}
{"text":"Bar resto belle ambiance chic et cozy, bon service, repas tres bon. Lumieres tamisées. Section tables et section bar aussi avec ecran."}
