{"text":"First time trying Eden Chinese on justeat.ca. Ordered the lo mein Cantonese noodles with lots of meat and veggies. Huge portion for $8.95. My friend got a dinner special, lots of veggies, meat and chicken balls which were not too greasy but just right. Prompt delivery too. and FREE delivery!! I definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Ugh.

Have you ever gone against your gut, screwed up royally and then thought, \"Should've listened to my mother\"? This meal was just like that, only it's more of a \"Should've listened to my Yelp fam.\" 

THE GOOD:
- The only silver living to this experience was the fortune cookies. You know the food is bad when you stop after 2-3 bites and go straight for the fortune cookies. 

THE BAD:
- The wait time: 1 hour and 20 minutes. Seriously? There isn't even snow on the ground - what's your excuse? I was especially annoyed by this because JUST-EAT.ca quoted me a wait time of 55 minutes. 
- The food, to put it simply, sucks. I ordered Sweet 'n Sour Chicken Balls - my childhood favourite - and the BBQ Pork Fried Rice. The Chicken Balls were just okay. The BBQ Pork Fried Rice was literally just that: pork chunks and (overcooked) rice. What happened to all of the other fried rice-y ingredients (e.g., egg, peas, carrots) that you typically find at other establishments? It's beyond me. 

The delivery man left behind a menu, and I was shocked to discover on the front that this craphole has been in business since 1959. Shocker! Do yourself a favour and avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I went in around 8pm to get take out. After I made my order I was just standing there at the counter and looking through a mirror on the side that points directly at the kitchen. The guy at the cash was coughing without covering his mouth and rubbing his nose with his hand. I gave him the benefit of the doubt because he handled the money and not the food. Then I saw him go back and start cooking while the other people there that had aprons on were doing other things. I'm a very patient person so I still gave him the benefit of the doubt because I could see him using utensils.  As he was putting the food together some fell on the side and he picked it up with his hand and put it in. Then he used his whole hand and started pushing the food down so he can cover it. I told him \"you handle money and I can see you touching my food\". He said \"I'll make you new one\".  He then started speaking Chinese to the actual cook and pointed to the mirror. Needless to say, I didn't make a fuss, said no thank you and walked out. I guarantee that mirror will be taken down."}
{"text":"For a small local place, not bad. The wife is nice, for a while she had my order memorized cause I got the same thing every time. The food is really simple, but I like it and I've never left with anything that tasted terrible. Unless they fail a health check, I don't intend to stop going from time to time"}
{"text":"Used to go there while on highschool. their prices are insanely cheap! They have varieties of dishes to choose from for the lunch special. They have fried rice, rice noodles, noodles for base and veggie options such as spring rolls, steamed veggie and meat such as sweet sour/crispy fried/ chilli chicken or bbq pork or beef with black bean sauce and many other. u can pick from any to build ur combo. quick service too. i still go there sometimes when im broke :P

their lunch special ends at 4. their order menu is not bad either. it can be a zoo until 4 pm because of the students from the East york c.i. but after 4 its quiet enough for a dine in."}
{"text":"OMG. WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY! PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,

1. Sweet and Sour Chicken totally salty and drenched in so much sweet n sour it looked like it was something radioactive. The chicken felt tough and old..doubt it was prepared the same day. 

2. Fried Dumpling - they gave me boiled dumplings they placed on one side in a pan for a couple minutes and burnt. I know the difference between fried and boiled dumpings. This was just boiled that they tried to pass off as fried.

3. Rice had no vegetables of anything, was old and tough as well. 

COULDN'T EVEN FINISH THIS FOOD IT WAS SO DISGUSTING. Into the garbage it went and I ordered from somewhere else because it was my birthday and I didn't want my meal to suck. EW EW EW. NEVER will I give this place my money again.

Not to mention customer service was horrendous when I called to complain about the state of my food. Their excuse was that's how they do it. UGH."}
{"text":"The food was average to good. The prices were reasonable. Delivery took 50 minutes during the middle of the afternoon, not a meal time rush and I'm about .6 km away. They make the lo mein the way I like it and I've been having trouble finding that in the area. I ordered a diet pepsi and they sent a caffeine free diet pepsi, I like my caffeine. I'd probably pick up from here if I were hungry but I don't know if I'd bother with deliver again, it would be much quicker to walk over."}
{"text":"Not very good
Rice tasted burnt
Spring rolls had way too much pepper 
Chicken balls were good"}
{"text":"You don't order Chinese delivery if you are looking to eat healthy, but this place takes greasy into a whole new realm.  I seriously question their deep fryer, or perhaps their chef - I squeezed an entire paper towel's worth of oil from a solitary chicken wing - and needed another paper towel ...

Some of their dishes are okay, the prices are cheap and they seem nice enough, but there's just no justifying a meal this unhealthy."}
{"text":"This has become our go-to place to order Chinese food. We've tried several others but always return to Eden. The food is always fresh and delicious. Delivery time is also quick and efficient."}
{"text":"I got very sick after eating this Chinese food. It is not good food and the place is very dirty!!"}
{"text":"Feed the children!!! This is not good for you food, but the lunch deals are CHEAP."}
{"text":"The absolute worst, I just cancelled didn't even get the food... over an hour waiting and I was told it is cooking and it would be another hour"}
{"text":"Ordered $50 of food for a family function.  It was horrible.  No receipt given, nothing .. all in all, very shady.  Used to be great at one time, just horrendous now."}
