{"text":"The owner is a jerk and there are lots of places to go for coffee around here where the owner isn't a jerk so I'm gonna pass on Coffee Coffee Coffee!"}
{"text":"This place is a perfect place to work away-from-home! They even have an endless mug of coffee for a great price. They are super friendly and it is always interesting to watch the bike work happening in the back too. It's been calm and friendly every time I've been so far! Good coffee, great service, and nice space!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, I totally get it. It's a tough place to get to but fear not there's ample parking right around the back! Just turn onto Broadview and go we're it says no outlet and boom. Parking. This is by far the cutest most modern place ever. They have fresh sandwiches on display to choose from, and even sell jams and local coffee brews. Their tea was so green and seems newly picked I felt like I could eat the stuff and turn into a goat. Super chic seating, and even have a small library to enjoy. It's a small homie staff that greets you when you arrive and are so nice you never want to leave. Coffee coffee coffee, so good you gotta say it three times!"}
{"text":"Beautiful aesthetics, amazing service, homey feel. Good ass coffee! They also have Herb n Twine sandwiches which can be panini'd at your request. If you've never had an Herb n Twine sandwich just be ready for a great sammy.. unique and crafted. The bike shop in the back has some of the most qualified professionals in the game and they will steer you straight (literally). I'll be getting a Springtime tune up for my bike and I'll definitely be grabbing a latte in the process. I recommend you do so too."}
{"text":"Good Coffee. So hip they don't have a discernible sign.I mean Eff the drive by or locals that don't know bout the location, right?! . Anywhoooo tasty clean espresso and coffee AND possibly get bicycle tuned up @ bike repair in back. Rad shop"}
{"text":"Great new coffee place in Old Brooklyn. Fortunately, my husband and I were able to go to the grand opening which assured us that... if the staff can remain calm, cool and collective while keeping their \"stuff\" in order with a very long line out the door, then they'll be a great business for years to come. I can confirm that is true. It's been nearly a month and the coffee is still tasty, the staff is still very friendly, and the premise is still beautiful clean and decorated."}
{"text":"Adorable little coffee shop. Great coffee. Great service. Great staff. Great and comfy decor inside. Seems very family oriented as the guy who gave me my coffee was with his son and teaching him how to deal with customers. It was adorable I think the boy was maybe 3-5. Plenty of street parking but it's a busy street so definitely cross at the cross walk. I didn't try any of the pastries but they looked amazing."}
{"text":"This place is great. I pass by it almost every morning on my way to work at MetroHealth, and I honestly get sad on the days I don't have time to stop. Great service and great coffee, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Roasted - loved the ambiance of the coffee shop. Incredibly clean. My iced chai was delicious - love that they use hot foam in their iced drinks! Service was friendly. 
Unroasted - bright clean with great service and great coffee. Nothing bad to say. No sugar."}
{"text":"When I showed up for coffee coffee coffee's grand opening today and saw the long line out the door, my hopes weren't high in terms of getting good service and good product. I figured they'd be rushed and running out. But it's clear they did their proper preparation, I had a great experience and I'm so happy to welcome them to the neighborhood!

Upon enter the building, I noted that the space is beautifully done and very welcoming. A great combination of light woods and potted plants give an organic feel, contrasted with metal bikes along the wall. Additionally, at the back of the caf√© is a bike repair and accessories station by sixth city cycles. And the front hosts two reading nooks with shelves of used books.

Once I made it to the register to place my order, I really appreciated the friendly welcome by the operator. Clearly she needs to move people through as fast as she can during a hectic morning, but she still made sure to smile and take the time to ask a couple questions, if you were from the neighborhood etc., and answer any you might have about the space. My mocha and rosemary bagel by Cleveland Bagel Co. followed shortly... and both were delicious!

They have a number of coffees on their menu, pastries, toast, bagels, and sandwiches by herb n twine. They said they'll be expanding their menu, too!

All in all, a fantastic first day and welcome addition to the Old Brooklyn neighborhood. Make sure to stop by experience it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Coffee Coffee Coffee is a great addition to Old Brooklyn. FYI if you're not from the neighborhood: they don't explicitly have a shop sign, so just look for the building that says \"coffee and bikes\" on the outside. I don't *think* there's any private parking here, but I didn't have any issues finding a free street spot.

I loved the atmosphere in here. It had a very clean, modern vibe with community bookcases, coffee for sale, and a shared atmosphere with Sixth City Cycles. You can see Norberto (Sixth City owner) in the back working on cycles, and cycles are even for sale on the wall! They also serve Herb'n'Twine sandwiches (SCORE), making it one of their rare places where you can grab a coffee AND lunch. Herb'n'Twine sammies are honestly the best ever. Coupled with excellent coffee = major win.

They have an awesome selection of coffee, including an excellent Jai Chai. My friend and I set up shop for a couple hours and it made for a great co-working environment. The coffee shop had stable wi-fi, decent seats and friendly staff. There's also full power strips on the floor, which is SO nice - no battling for outlets here. The owners are also awesome people! Great conversation, and I appreciated the cucumber water near the register. I can't wait to come back here. Support local!"}
{"text":"I finally made it today and ordered 2 Mochas to go. DELICIOUS! I want to try the regular cofee and teas next. The sandwiches looked good too. There is parking in the back so don't worry about parking on Pearl Road"}
{"text":"The owner, Trey, thought it would be okay to mock my Korean coworker, SK by implying she doesn't understand basic English. Occuring at a latte art competition with plenty of other local roasters and shops in the Cleveland community, obviously this behavior isn't acceptable. \"DO YOU UNDERSTAND? DO YOU GET THE INSTRUCTIONS?\" and then mocking her every move as she faced him. She beat him fair and he still had the nerve to mock her. Now when called out on Facebook (he reported the review and had it taken down), he called my work and threatened my boss and I for my leaving of the review. In which case, I agreed to recant if he had given a formal apology to acknowledge that what he said was wrong. He contacted SK ONCE, to get \"her side of the story\", and claims that he has no idea what we're referring to and \"forgot\" what he said. He still claims this currently. We have been reasonable, but have pushed forward to spreading the word all over Columbus, Cleveland and the rest of the internet on Google... and now here.
Yesterday, we see that someone left a review on his Google page to counteract our claims by calling us drug addicts and implying we sell our bodies (no joke, the profile's name is Mr. Wednesday.) 
All because he cannot own up to his mistakes and shortcomings, and being the decent business owner he should be. This is abhorrent behavior."}
{"text":"CUTE! So cute!!! There isn't really a sign out front- look for the storefront that says \"coffee + bikes\" and there ya go. The front is a coffee shop that sells cle bagel co bagels & sandwiches from Herb n Twine, the back is a bike shop. Interesting combo that works for them. The cold brew coffee was very good, and the owner was helpful. This area needed this cute little local coffee shop. I foresee myself getting much studying done here in the future!"}
{"text":"I quite liked this place. It was very coooooool, and the owner was very kind. Very welcomed and up-and-coming place for the OB area. I believe he also owns the hostile in Ohio City, which you could tell because both places are very similar. Oh, and there is a bike shop in the back. Why? I don't know, but it doesn't make the place smell like tires.  And towards the front there seems to be a mini-library. 

Chai was delicious! And this place offers a bottomless coffee. Coffee was very tasty, and I'm saying this as a person who does not drink coffee. The food that was there was actually brought in. For example, Cleveland Bagel Co. and Herb n' Twine sandwiches. Of course, getting this stuff at the actual place is one notch fresher but it's nice to have the offering. I don't think any food is made on location? But don't hold me to that assumption. 

OVERALLLLLL... Drinks are good. There is free Wi-Fi. It has a bathroom. So, drink coffee and poop away."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesomeeeeeeee place!  So this place is a very cozy coffee shop!  The best part about this place is that they have a bike repair shop in the back of the shop so you can enjoy your brew while they fix up your bike.  They provide different types of local food to choose from that rotates so you don't always order the same exact thing.  I believe this is their way to promote what else Cleveland has to offer.  

There wasn't a long line when we got here which was pleasant.  They have several areas for people to sit but it can get pretty crowded quickly if people start taking up a whole table to use for their study material.

Overall it's an amazing place with bold and delicious coffee!!! You can also buy some coffee grinds to bring home to enjoy their delicious coffee in your home!"}
{"text":"Still a five star place. The coffee, food, service, and people are the best. Yelp says to keep writing so here goes. Coffee, Coffee, Coffee is a place you should stop at every day. Have a couple of coffees, a cookie or two, a bagel or a sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is great! I have received several recommendations to come here. First it has a great atmosphere, hip but not to hip that you feel out of place and it's welcoming. They had a hand full of people they were studying/working on their computers so it's definitely a good place to relax. Also they had some bike stuff for sale in the back and I think you can get your bike fixed there as well. I really like the set up and the decor is really cool. There is no overhead sign that reads \"coffee coffee coffee\" but it does have two big overhead signs that say \"coffee\" and \"bikes\" so it's easy to find. They don't offer any lot parking but there is plenty of street parking in the area. 
I had a maple latte which was absolutely delicious! I never really know what to order when I go to a new place but the baristas were very helpful. I definitely want to go back and try some different flavors. They have some tasty looking pastries and also offer some vegan ones too! They also sell locally made jam which I though was pretty cool. I will definitely be making more trips out there!"}
{"text":"Perfectly poured lattes, dark, roasty cold brew, and a carefully curated assortment of baked goods, toast with gourmet jams, and the best sandwiches ever. 

Minimalist/modern decor, generally either very busy or very quiet. They split the space with a bicycle shop, so if you need to check your ride while you get your caffeine fix, well, voila."}
{"text":"coffee is so good! you can even get cool flavors like strawberry and blueberry lattes made from jam! you can tell the owner really loves working here and he's super friendly. i would suggest this place to anyone! coffee is strong though, so get creamer"}
{"text":"Xenophobic and unwelcoming. I will never visit a store whose owner finds it acceptable to belittle and degrade another person based on race, or any other aspect of their lives. Not worth your time to visit."}
{"text":"Fav coffee shop and I love that it's in Old Brooklyn! Staff is friendly and spunky.  Bottomless mug of coffee for $3??  Um, Yesssss. Molded sugar shapes and latte art? Duh... Gotta have it.  Features locally made jams that are to die for on locally made bagels and bread. Must try the Honey Latte!"}
{"text":"COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE
This coffee shop / bike repair shop is a cool addition to Old Brooklyn. The sunny and spacious coffee shop offers lots of seating. The barista was super friendly. 

The drip coffee was really good. I'm so used to pour overs that when the barista reached for a stainless steel pitcher I started to get disappointed. But not for long. The coffee was flavorful, fruity maybe, nicely balanced and really good.  

I got with it some toast (inch thick sliced sourdough from the west side market) and jam. There were many good sounding jams to select from. I went with a blueberry and was not disappointed. While it wasn't thick or full of actual blueberry pieces it was good, not too sweet, and the portion was perfect for the toast I was given. 

I also tried a latte which ended up being my favorite thing. The cup was massive, filled to the brim and topped with a creamy, delicious thick foam. The lattes come regular ($4) or in three flavor varieties (Rhubarb, strawberry, Carmel +$1). I wasn't sure what to expect with the rhubarb but it was delicious. It wasn't too sweet, but wasn't bitter either. The flavor and the espresso worked well together. It was delicious to the last drop. 

SIXTH CITY CYCLES
Bike tune-ups are $60. Safety tune-ups are $40. They do a quick look over when you bring it in and determine what level of service you need. No appointment needed to drop it off. You can even drop it off when the bike station is closed (but the coffee shop is open). I was able to get a safety tune-up done on a Saturday morning in about 3 hours. 

Free street parking right in front. Meters along the side street. Parking lot in the back, but it's really tight."}
{"text":"Great to see my old stomping grounds coming back to life. This is a great spot to relax with a book and sip on a delicious cup of Joe. I've lived in NYC for 10 years now and whenever I come home to visit the Cleve, I'm always a little disappointed at the coffee finds being spoiled to great coffee in NYC. This place didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Really cool place love finding local places to go. They also have an on site bike shop, how cool is that."}
