{"text":"Great and delicious Mediterranean food at reasonable prices. Friendly staff...a must try!"}
{"text":"We had a very nice experience here. The combination appetizer plate was great, the medium was plenty for the 4 of us. Also the desserts were very good i am so glad we got them"}
{"text":"The previous reviews were indeed right. We were looking for a place that had good Turkish food. The food was fresh, made to order and truly outstanding. The service was cheerful and quick. The small combo appetizer platter could feed 4 people, and the lamb kabobs were tender and flavorful. Some of the dishes are what I grew up with in eastern Europe, and some were better than my mom's. LOL!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here from New Jersey for a wedding, and we popped in for lunch after seeing the great yelp reviews. We wanted something a little different and we were not disappointed.  We ordered the Baba Ganush as an appetizer, and the ayran drink to start. The Baba Ganush was really great - smokey and pleasantly chilly for a hot day. The ayran is a strong yogurt drink that is good for counteracting spice. The bread was warm and fresh and was frequently refilled. We ordered the gyro kebab with yogurt and the sultan's delight for meals. The gyro was cooked perfectly, very tender. The sauce and croutons were well seasoned. A sizeable portion of yogurt on the side was the perfect compliment to the creamy tomato and succulent meat. The sultan's delight was excellent, and must be tried. We had the milk custard for dessert and though we were full to bursting we couldn't help but finish the entire thing.  The staff was very attentive, polite and knowledgeable. The restaurant had a great atmosphere and was very clean (including the bathrooms). If you're in the area, it would be silly not to visit."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite restaurant on the West Side of Cleveland. I have never had a bad meal here. Not even an mediocre meal.   It is a bit pricy compared to most Middle Eastern restaurants but that's because the ingredients are top notch.The steak kebabs are filet. The desserts are incredible. Even the tea has a complexity that I have never tasted anywhere before. Tea!  It's BYOB though. There is a wise shop a couple doors down so that's not a problem at all.   The owners are a sweet couple from New Jersey that moved here to take over this restaurant purely on speculation. The service is excellent.   I recommend any of the kebabs, especially the mixed grill and the sensational mixed vegetarian appetizer plate."}
{"text":"Best place ever great service.. Very welcoming I'm from New York and event time I drive to Michigan I stop by here ..."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. Food comes out fast and very delicious. The lamb is especially tender and yummy! Their beef is always very flavorful. Also a must to get dessert, no regrets."}
{"text":"Good food but it's too pricey. They do takeout and have decent servings. Love the rice pilaf."}
{"text":"Went on a weekday, the restaurant was almost empty.The staff were very attentive and the place was nice and clean. We placed our orders, I really liked my husband's entree ( minced chicken kabaab), mine was just OK. Will go again. Recommend!"}
{"text":"We love Mediterranean food. As stupid Americans, the local Aladins was always one of our favorite places to eat...until now. This place is at a whole other level. Delicious food, great service and a delightful environment.   As a side note, they don't have a liquor license, however; they will allow you to BYOB."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great hummus, servoce; amazing food!!!  Have never had a bad experience and even got my parents and in-laws to try it and they loved it too"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Attentive staff good decor. Lamb was really good Try it you will like it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Turkish food.  Excellent service.  Great atmosphere.  I came here Saturday for a late dinner, and was treated to an exciting array of well-spiced dishes with fresh ingredients.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The basket of bread is great, hummus was tasty.  I ordered the lamb shish Lamb cooked a little more than medium, but still excellent.  Aziz and Jasmine are doing a wonderful job."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to make the 1 hour 20 minutes drive from Canton, Ohio (stark county) but we said why not, it's Friday night. Well, it was worth the drive. Very nice and warm place and the food was truly delicious. My wife got the red snapper fish and she loved it. I got the mixed grill and wow, lots of great tasting mixtures of meats, just the way I like it. Our kids had the beat Adena and we all shared mixed appetizer plus cheese filled egg rolls (it looks like egg rolls but it's not ) We finished our meal with Turkish tea and Knafa for desert"}
{"text":"Cabbage rolls and bulgar pilaf were very flavorful. I will only be in town for two days and I may need to come back to try something else."}
{"text":"One of the best places to grab a bite hands down. Freshly made Mediterranean food at all times. Very friendly and professional staff as well, this place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Absolute ripoff! For the amount of food you get for the price it's ridiculous,I've ate at dozens of Turkish places and this place is just not even worth it at all.This kind of food is actually my favorite and I live a couple miles from the restaurant so if it was reasonable priced and the portions were good then I'd return but unfortunately they're not.Never again stay away and go to Alladdins or Sitos or something."}
{"text":"So good! I came here with a friend who was visiting from out of town. One of us is vegetarian and the other vegan, and there were plenty of menu options for both of us. We both got Turkish tea (which came in very small glasses, but had free refills - phew) and ordered a few appetizers to split between us. Everything we tried was the best we'd had - zucchini pancakes, hummus, falafel, stuffed grape leaves. We were also served warm bread with two dipping sauces, which we didn't expect. All in all, it was a great value for the price, and I'm certain I'll be coming by again!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Friendly staff. Great food. Try the mixed grill and the appetizer platter. Both great for sharing and to try lots of menu items."}
{"text":"I was only in town for a few days and my mom and i were hungry so i found this place on yelp. The restaurant is beautiful the service from Jasmine was amazing, I love the falafel! There's a spicy sauce that I dip everything in, its supposed to be for the bread but its excellent on the meat as well. My mom and I shared a dish that had a little of every meat laid on a bed of savory rice. The chicken steak and lamb were tender juicy and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I wish I could remember the names... But we also had a dessert that was the first one on the menu starts with a k. Reminds me of jello or flan it wasn't too sweet and it tasted great."}
{"text":"Best falafel ever! Amazing appetizers! We had a wonderful meal with exceptional service - remarkable food."}
{"text":"My wife and I had never had Turkish food before this and were somewhat apprehensive but decided to give a shot. We're glad we did because it's delicious! I had a dish called Sultans Special with lamb, vegetables, and a somewhat spicy sauce surrounded by an eggplant puree. The bread is also excellent (tastes kind of like pizza crust) and comes with two different dipping sauces. The server was very attentive and kept refilling our tea and bringing more bread. Serving sizes are huge. I think I needed to be rolled out of there! Definitely no room for desert."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Wonderful baba, bread, and the lamb kofte adana were favorites, but all entrees were delicious. I'm an east sider so wish I cold get here more often, but best persian food I've had in Cleveland and anywhere else. Beautiful decor and service was very attentive."}
{"text":"Incredible service. Great food.  Get the lamb adana, kunafa and tea. You won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Food is great, staff is great. What else can I say. I bumped into this place on my road trip and wanted to try some middle eastern food. Their gyro with yogurt called Iskender was delicious. The rice pudding was fresh. I recommend everyone who wants to have some good taste of mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"Wow! This is a great restaurant! Because of my late mother-in-law's Mediterranean background, we have tried as many as Mediterranean restaurants wherever we travelled to. This is the best Mediterranean restaurant we have tried. We have tried the following dishes; and all of them were excellent: Falafel, Red Lentil Soups, and Lamb Shish Kebab. We wish this restaurant would offer/serve Lahmacun everyday (not just Sundays)."}
{"text":"Literally cannot put into words how amazing this place is. To start, the staff are super friendly, and the ambiance is great for anyone looking for a sit down place to eat. But most importantly, the food is on another level. This is arguably my favorite restaurant in the entire Cleveland area. The grilled meats are succulent, and there's a lot of variety within the menu for anyone looking to try something new. Get the knafeh and tea for dessert to top off your fantastic meal. If I could go higher than 5 stars, I would. It's just that good."}
{"text":"Meddetrainian food should be fresh ,healthy and affordable. That's what we got there. The food was great. The place was filled with Turkish folks  (good sign ).I was waiting to be treated like a stupid American, but the waiter and the owner gave us personalized attention. We felt welcomed and appreciated.we left the place full and happy.the next time I'm close by, I'll go back and try more off the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food. We've had Mediterranean food all over the U.S. This is possibly the best we've ever had! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service. Sigara appetizer is amazing. Child friendly and also good for takeout."}
{"text":"Very fresh and  delicious! Can't wait to try the whole fish on my next visit. You get all this and great service as well"}
{"text":"Wow. The flavored took me all the way back to Istanbul. And they had apple tea which was the perfect flavor."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect with Turkish. Great food! The service was prompt and everything was well prepared."}
{"text":"Better flavor than most places I have tried in Istanbul. We have tried the mixed appetizer, shepherd salad, mixed grill and finished off with a homemade kunefe and cay. Clean family restaurant, friendly service, easy to find parking and easy on your wallet."}
{"text":"I write this as I eat. OMG, so delicious! I stumbled upon this place after a long day at a conference. I asked the young man at the front to recommend me his favorite. He suggested a kabob combo. So much better than I ever expected. High quality ingredients and excellent preparation."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot!!! Consistently good and fresh with excellent service from the owners and their staff. The complimentary bread is some of the best you will ever eat."}
{"text":"I have been here four or five times now, and it's *always* amazing. Get the cold appetizer platter to try all of their delicious appetizers. As others have said, the red lentil soup is great. And you really can't go wrong with the doner meat, no matter how you get it.  I'm so glad this place is here - it fulfills a need I didn't even realize I had!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times. I cannot recommend it enough. There food is delicious. Normally I get one of the following dishes: chicken adana kabab, lamb adana kabab, and the filet mignon kebab. They are all excellent. They are all served with vegetables and rice and are delicious. Also the bread they give you is pretty good to. Once again the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Great find in Avon! Try the meza first, and don't miss the desserts made in-house. It's hard to find great Turkish food like this anywhere in the U.S., let alone right here in Avon. I've always encountered friendly staff and never had a negative food experience here! Don't be fooled by the name change, this place is still going strong, and is well worth a visit."}
{"text":"We could not have had a better dinner experience. Calamari was light and crispy. Sautéed spinach was an amazing combination of flavors. Had the Istanbul Special with filet that was  tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. We had the Red lentils soup, awesome! Lamb was very smooth with tasty yoghurt sauce! The white bean salad was to die for!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great ambiance. The food, especially, is outstanding.  The grilled shrimp dish is superb.  Every item on the appetizer selection is excellent -- there are so many ways to get dolmas wrong.  This place has managed to get dolmas (and so many other Mediterranean dishes) spot on.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"Ok - I've not been to this location but used to go to the Cleveland Heights location. It's been years, but had a friend visiting the area recently and recommended they stop here: they were thrilled. Me? Well, I live in Berkeley and when a space for a restaurant becomes available in Rockridge...I wish and wish and wish.....it would be filled with Istanbul Mediterranean!"}
{"text":"I have loved this place since it was the dervish grill. Friendly people great food. Thier cold simpler appetizer plater is a meal in its self. Stop by you will love it."}
{"text":"You can tell everything is fresh here. I tried the mixed appetizer and it had a good variety of dips that went well with their homemade bread. The mixed grill is great for two to share and you get to try a sampling of their kebabs."}
{"text":"Delicious!  A hidden gem. Everything was fresh tasting and well-prepared. Loved the zucchini pancake, calamari, gyro wrap. Fresh, homemade bread was complimentary. Reasonable prices. Excellent service. You should try it!"}
{"text":"What do you get when you improve on Dervish, the place that formerly had this spot in Avon?  You end up with Istanbul Grill, a low-key, strip center, delicious take on mainly Turkish food.  Same furnishings, same sort of photos on the wall showing Turkish life, same ambience... but the food is a wee tad different.  Tried their pita wrap Doner (better known to most as a \"gyro\"), and it was acceptable, what with its combo beef-lamb having been marinated nicely.  Falafel was nicely cooked, crunchy on the outside but moist inside.  Hummus was good, not too much in the way of garlic added.  Served with the hummus is a wonderful loaf of freshly-made bread for dipping, not the usual pita.   French fries accompanying wraps were in the middle of the crunchy/flaccid continuum.  Accomodating & friendly folks own & work there.  I feel prices were on the high side -- perhaps 15% higher than they could have been.  BUT... next time I'll see how they do on lamb and on sutlac (rice pudding)!"}
{"text":"Great food, lovely proprietors! Chicken kebab wrap and shawarma wrap were fantastic. So was falafel wrap. Very authentic and delicious. Yum! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local restaurants. I love the sampler entree and kanafeh for dessert.  Under new management and you can definitely taste it. I eat here at least once a month.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Solid food (ive had pretty much everything on the menu except the \"pizza\" which is only available on Sunday)  If you like kabobs, falefel, or any turkish/Mediterranean food, this is an oasis in the Avon area .   The service staff is always on point, knowledgeable, and eager to help you navigate something new    I suggest having and buying a bag of turkish tea. Its worth it after a rich meal    Try it once and you'll be a fan forever -  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place so while I was visiting Ohio from California this place was one of my go to places I had to try. And boy was I pleased! Everything was yummy, fresh, the meats were juicy and the bread was hot and steamy. The appetizer plates were delicious, I personally didn't care for the grape leaves because they are oddly sweet like there was cinnamon in there. Being middle eastern myself, I've had plenty of middle eastern food and this place was great! Everything came in a timely manner and the restaurant was clean and a nice atmosphere while the staff was super friendly and inviting. The price is a bit high but you get what you pay for. Only regret I had, I wish I would have got to try the knaffa, a sweet dessert that's a middle eastern fav! Definitely will be visiting again, next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant I've ever been in in the US, I am an arabic and I know the good arabic food. I went too many arabic restaurant all over the US, and this one was the worst experiment.   I got the mix grilled, and the chicken with yogurt. the rice was ok not even good. The meet wasn't cooked well!   I saw the reviews here and I expected more than what I got.   The service was great, but the main reason of going to a restaurant is to have a good food.  The prices also are so high. I'm okay with that if the food was worth the money.   I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Great delicious  food n service. First time my sister in law had Turkish food and was a bit nervous but went ahead n tried and absolutely loved each of the platters we ordered. A great sampling of cold appetizers, a platter of various shish kabobs and a sampling of desserts  waiter was very attentive and chef came out to greet us as we had requested to thank him. Rochester  NY and Iowa residents thank you"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one day midweek, and I was very happy. The hummus was great, the pita was plentiful, and I had a falafel salad that was excellent. To be honest, I wouldn't say it's better than Aladdin's, even though I was satisfied with the flavors of the food. Service was impeccable."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the Western Cleveland suburbs, and decided to try this place on the way home. We were delighted! The food was wonderful, and the service was personable and friendly.   We started with the cold Mixed Appetizer platter (we ordered a small platter), which we shared. Because we are not fans of baba ganush, we asked to substitute additional stuffed grape leaves, and our server was happy to do so. Everything on the plate was excellent. We were pleasantly surprised by the ezme, which was slightly spicy, and full of tomato and other flavors. The grape leaves were tight and delightfully spiced. The hummus seemed to us to be homemade.  The bread, which was hot from the oven, was simply tremendous. Both of us could have ended the meal happily there, but there was more goodness to come.  We decided to share a combination plate of the doner and lamb adana kebabs. Adana appears to be the Turkish equivalent of kafta, and was excellent. The doner is the equivalent of gyro meat, but not the pre-formed and frozen variety -- to the contrary, it was sliced off the spit after roasting. This was served with rice pilaf, shredded red cabbage and red onion. We could not finish the serving between us -- and it became lunch for both of us the next day (and heated well in our microwave).  We tried to wave off dessert -- to no avail. Our server/hostess brought us a complimentary order of kazandibi, which we also enjoyed immensely despite my not being a person who eats dessert. Kazandibi is a roll of custard rolled in cinnamon with a bit of whipped cream on the side. It was not too sweet, nor was it particularly heavy. A perfect ending to a delightful meal.  We found the service and the personnel in the restaurant to be friendly, helpful, personable and attentive. Thumbs up to the couple who own it.  This restaurant is in a strip mall, and the construction on Chester Road east of S.R. 83 makes it a bit of a challenge to visit. It is across Chester from Walmart, and on the east end of the strip mall. Chester is the first road north of I-90/S.R. 2 as you travel north on S.R. 83."}
{"text":"Yum!  So glad this place is still open.  Loved the warm bread and dips, and really enjoyed the bean salad with warm toasty falafel.  My husband had the Istanbul Signature Kebab.  I'm a vegetarian and he's a meat-eater - both very happy!  Service was very nice and attentive.  Wish we had room for dessert - their desserts are fabulous.  I guess we will have to go back - yay"}
{"text":"Both my teens like it here!  Little pricey but friendly, casual place. Good hummus and falafel and a few other vegan dishes. We can always get a table so I hope they're able to stick around!"}
{"text":"The food was really good, but I could have totally eaten another entree. I don't know if I'm a typical American that can eat for days, or if the portions were just really small. Whatever. Feed me, Seymour."}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Cleveland and I've probably tried them all. I get the veggie sauté almost every time and the chef chicken special is addictively good. The hummus is different than any other I've had but so great."}
{"text":"I was looking for a turkish restaurant for a while now and I'm glad I found this place. I can't wait to come back again. Iskander kabab is my favorite. I really like this place. The food is really good and delicious."}
{"text":"My family came here for lunch and we were surprised how empty the place was. The food was delicious and the waiters catered to our needs. I had the croutons covered in yogurt, topped with lamb and it was SO good. We also got the appetizer where you try every dip they have and I can say they were all very good. Only thing is I thought the food was kind of pricey. Overall though, would probably come here again."}
{"text":"Had to know why everyone was giving this restaurant 5 Stars. After having dinner here, I now know. The stuffed cabbage and vegetable sauté we ordered were delicious. Since they do not serve alcohol they have to make it on their food and service. Both are excellent. This is now a new favorite place for me!"}
{"text":"Istanbul is great! The food is beyond delicious and the staff is kind and helpful. They also allow you to bring in bottles of wine which is great. The Turkish coffee is so good and so is the platter with tabouli and baba ghanoush. I even went here after my wedding to have a tasty meal!"}
{"text":"Try the mixed grill you will love it! Great food, very consistent. Shepard salad and Eggplant Sauce are the best."}
{"text":"Delicious food every time we go. Lamb kebabs are my favourite, love the rice and vegetables the bread is good and so is the cucumber yogurt sauce."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food, let's say amazing food. Great atmosphere, Great staff. Definitely coming back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"the food was super good...I just don't think there was enough for the price.   16$ for rice onions and cabbage and one chicken shish kabob (four pieces) and a scoop of gyro meat.  Hubby got the falafel dinner and by all means it should have been an appetizer because  it was so small portion too little food for 13$.   We probably won't be back only because of the prices but the food was very good and the chicken was superb."}
{"text":"I had the mix grill it  was  best I ever had kabab  was   tender the chicken juicy and gyro was the best .than for dessert I had knafa best in Ohio it is best Turkish cuisine in town"}
{"text":"The food is consistently delicious, made fresh and served by friendly knowledgeable staff. The good being Turkish is very similar to other other Mediterranean and Middle East cuisine but with some pleasant differences. The spice palette is unique tasty without being overpowering. Some dishes have a hint of heat.   A favorite for dining in is the small appetizer sampler. Wonderful way to try the more popular appetizers. Followed by one of the kabob dinners, all of which are quite substantial.   I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this restaurant to anyone that enjoys Greek or Middle Eastern food. It's it also a very good choice for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Hummus and Turkish coffee were delicious. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife lived in Istanbul a while back. Decided to surprise her with a visit to this little gem. Tucked away in chain filled Avon/Lake, Istanbul offers a fresh take on Mediterranean cuisine. Right off I-90, very convenient to find. Parking is simple as there is a designated lot.   Walked in and was immediately greeted by the amazing wait staff. They were so courteous they asked me if my car lights turned off by itself. I politely said yes, but it was very courteous of them to ask.  Went on a Friday evening about 6 and there was plenty of space for us to sit. Right as we were leaving it started to fill up.   We had fresh bread with cucumber and tomato sauce deliver shortly after we ordered our drinks. Bread was flaky and the sauces complimented it very well. We also ordered Sigara Boregi as an app per my wife's recommendation. Wow! The feta cheese was fresh and the phyllo dough was crispy! It was a little salty, but I think that's how it's suppose to be.   After reading other Yelp reviews, I ordered the Doner kabob. The slices of beef/lamb came HUGE on my plate. The meat was tender and very very flavorful. It was complimented with a side of pilaf rice and veggies. I can usually throw down a plate, but I had to get a to-go box. I liked taking the bread and wrapping the meat up like a makeshift gyro. It was a lot of food, well worth the price.   My wife had the Iskender Kebob with yogurt. Personally, I liked this better than my dish. The butter tomato sauce on hers is what made the difference. It came with bread in the middle and soaked up all the juices from the meat and sauce.   Once we finished we ordered Turkish tea and Turkish coffee. I've never had it before, and i usually like my coffee strong. But, my wife recommended that I get light sugar. Darn, she was right! I was glad I had some sugar, but my oh my was if strong. After I finished my coffee, my wife said the customary thing to do was to turn the cup upside down for a few minutes and the grounds could reveal possible images which are open to interpretation.   All in all, a very great first visit. We had had the pleasure of speaking to the owner for a bit and he was very nice! Service 5 stars. Food 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Truly a welcome addition to the Northern Ohio dining scene!   The service is amazing-- efficient, friendly, knowledgeable, could not be better.   The food is flawlessly prepared, flavorful and sensational.   I love Turkish cuisine, it's very healthy and many layers of flavor and Istanbul does it right.   The family that operates this restaurant really takes pride in their recipes and preparation and sincerely cares that you have a perfect dining experience-- they succeed!   We have now been several times and have introduced some friends to this place who also enjoyed it.  I can not recommend any one item in particular as everything that all of us have tried has been magnificent!"}
{"text":"Lovely food, nice service, reasonable prices. I loved the kofta kabob and appetizers platter. Deserts looked great but I had no room. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious! Location is weird in a little outdoor strip mall. Service was top notch. Looked nice inside but we wanted to sit outside! Food SO good!!! The best!"}
{"text":"This place was great. The atmosphere was really nice, and family and group friendly. The people that had to wait didn't wait long and its worth the wait regardless. The food was amazing. We had the stuffed grape leaves to start, and split a entree which was plenty of food for both my wife and i. My wife had the rice pudding and i had the kazandibi both were really really good. The price was surprising we thought it was going to be more expensive, that was a pleasant surprise. We will defiantly be going back and bring friends with us. Great experience."}
{"text":"There are 3 primary reasons to eat here: The food, the food, the food! The variety and quality of authentic Mediterranean delicacies are unmatched! There is something for every taste, meats and vegetables prepared to please the palate and the eyes. Vegetarians will also find reasons to love the menu, as many non-meat meals are offered. Add to your dining experience the friendly and speedy wait staff and reasonable prices, and this restaurant  stands-out from the many other restaurants in the immediate area. We will certainly visit Istanbul Mediterranean Grill again, and obviously we can highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food is so phenomenal.  We came here after reading other Yelp reviews.  We had the hummus w/ bread, calamari, and Mixed [insert name here can be shared].  I think I've found my regular place to eat out at.  Also, the service was excellent.  They were very helpful in recommending food options."}
{"text":"This was our second visit in the last month and was not disappointed.  The service, food and atmosphere are great.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys excellent cuisine."}
{"text":"Definitely try to stuffed cabbage, I am a Polish descent and we make ours a bit different,  but this is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent all around. We had shrimp kabob, filet minion kebab, calamari, stuffed grape leaves, tabouli, hummus. Wonderful baba ganush. Has a smoky flavor. Kunefe dessert was a wonderful way to end the meal. Great, friendly service."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for dinner and we had the mixed appetizer,  the chicken shish kabob with yogurt and the kunefe for dessert. Everything was absolutely delicious and the service was excellent.  We would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good quality food and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and tasty. The price was a bit steep for the atmosphere and what you are getting. The meat used in any of the kabobs is top notch. I love the bread. My steak kabobs do seem to have been a bit over cooked for how I ordered them but they still tasted good. Hummus was fresh. Flavor is there. The 5th star is missing bc the price was $50 before tip for just two people ordering an entree and sharing an order of hummus, no beverages. Will be back"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time and we loved it.  Everything was wonderful.  We had Calamari for an appetizer.  We had kabobs and some of the specialty dishes.  The kitchen was running a little behind, which I did not think was an issue, so she brought us a plate of dessert which was also delicious.  How nice that they would compensate for making us wait and it wasn't even that long.  We will be go back and try some more of their dishes."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this place for quite a while, until finally I was overcome by boredom. So, one Friday evening I decided to make the drive out to Avon... and I'm glad I did! The restaurant itself sits at the far corner of a strip mall, and upon walking in it was moderately busy.   I was immediately greeted and after being seated, reviewed the menu and decided upon a bowl of red lentil soup and a Turkish tea. I would have gotten something more sizable,  but wasn't particularly hungry as I ate earlier. The tea was excellent and is brewed using loose leaf tea, not tea bags like so many places use. Even better, refills are on the house, so I opted for 3 more cups! Complementary fresh baked bread is served with every meal and comes with two dipping sauces, a yogurt based one and a spicy red sauce. Lastly, the lentil soup was outstanding and provoded a satisfying reprieve from the cold! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place, nice decor. Fast attentive service.  I had 'iskender' kabob. I liked the meat part but not the croutons underneath. Their bread is very very good, actually they should use that bread for the Iskender. Their fillet mignon was excellent.  Baklava was good. Kazandibi was almost there but not quite. Still very delicious. They were out of sutlac. Definitely would recommend thus place."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? This place is legitimately a jewel of the west side.   Their lahmacun (I'm sure I spelled that wrong) was totally awesome and unique. It's like a Turkish pizza covered in lamb! Would highly recommend if you're looking to try something new. They only serve it in Sunday's after 12:30 or so! (We got their at 11:45 and we were disappointed that we couldn't order it, but we got one to go instead! )  We also got the mixed appetizer, which had the most amazing spreads and dips! (Hummus, baba, etc...) my philosophy is why get one dip when you can get them all? I was surprised at the cost; I think it was around $15 but it's awesome.   We got dessert, of course, and holy baklava! It was amazing! Don't forget the Turkish coffee... it's also life changing.  Other pro tips from the folks sitting at tables around us... get the phyllo-wrapped feta \"cigars\", the lentil soup, and Turkish tea.   Finally, our service was fantastic. Our waiters so our friendly, helpful, and attentive.   We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The best one around. Perfect food, perfect taste. Great service, best bread, fresh and tasty. Kunafe is really good and tea is perfect."}
{"text":"Just had their filet mignon kabob on a take out order. AMAZING! Their service was excellent as well. I arrived early for my pick up. They offered me tea or water as I waited (even though they weren't running behind, I was just early). The offer was appreciated. I'm new to Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food but this place hit the spot on all accounts, in my opinion. Well done! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Big area to eat, comfy boots, clean everywhere.  I ordered chicken sish kebab, which served very fresh and neat. Try their chicken vegetable soup too. Dont forget to try turkish tea.  Plus you can see one of the best pictures of Istanbul on the wall."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Avon Lake. Everything on the menu is good and the prices are reasonable. The staff is very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Great authentic Turkish food. I had the Lahmacun \"Turkish Pizza\" ( ONLY AVAILABLE ON SUNDAYS ) Turkish-style pizza flatbread topped with ground lamb and vegetables. Was very delightful. For desert, You most have the hot Kunefe Shredded wheat stuffed with unsalted mozzarella, and topped with sugar syrup. Served HOT."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant here on Yelp and told my husband I'd like to try it. The pictures posted looked so delicious! Well, they are as good as they look! No, they were better!  Since it was our first time there, the waiter suggested the small cold appetizer platter and the mixed grill platter for us to s  hare. Perfect choice for a first trip. It was outstanding!! We went at an off time and you never know what you're going to get. Never fear, everything was freshly prepared and delicious. If you're trying to decide if you want to try it or not, rest assured, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered fish last week when I went there and after a 30 mind wait I got a fish that was like a sun dried fish,a very small and skinny and it was really really hard to eat it. Mostly there were bones in it and it was very cold. And even I told the server that it's very hard and cold and she said this is how it suppose to be. Well it was the first and last time i ate there. Never going back again but restaurant was clean and have some good pictures so I will give two stars for cleanliness I wish they serve some tasty food. Don't go for the pictures the one they show in the menu. The food never looks like they were shown in the pictures of the menu."}
{"text":"Nice Mediterranean cuisine with efficient service. Lunch portions available. Prices are reasonable for the portion size. The falafel was crispy on the outside and moist inside. The chicken sish could have used a little more spice. The side rice pilaf was bland. The chicken Adana was nicely flavored. They do provide complimentary pita bread with a red spicy sauce and a yogurt mint based sauce which helped add taste to the dish. Vegetarian options are plenty. Definitely worth revisiting."}
{"text":"Went there to grab something small and ended up with a full meal!  Very tasty!  Recommend the lamb!  I will be back."}
{"text":"Mediterranean is my absolute favorite type of food and I can say that without a doubt this place is authentic and one of the best. I've been here twice now and their food is top quality. Everything is home made (even the delicious bread.) The lamb is cooked to perfection and I'm obsessed with their falafel. From the first bite, it's obvious that they know what they're doing!   The menu is great- there are tons of options and something for just about every taste bud. The service is always super friendly and polite. Great prices. Definitely going to become a regular!!!"}
{"text":"Best baklava ever. Clouds of pastry with just the right amount of filling. Without a doubt, this is what baklava is supposed to taste like. I'm not sure how they do it, but it is heavenly."}
{"text":"We liked a lot food was very fresh. Service was very good. Best Turkish in cleveland area for sure"}
{"text":"Best food in Lorain County hands down. I recommend the Mixed Grill.  If you are a coffee drinker then you must try the Turkish coffee.   I have been here with plenty of guests and every single time it has been delicious with great service."}
{"text":"This restaurant would be a good reason to move to this town. Very tasty food with generous portions. As a Turkish guy, food feels just like home."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!  Worth the visit!  Hummus was the best i have had.  Even versus homemade.  Sultan saute is HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"I came to Istanbul Grill with high expectations because of the near perfect ratings on Yelp.  I love turkish food, and really enjoy trying new restaurants so it has been on my list of places to try for a while now.   I tried the Iskender with yogurt entree and my dining companion had Chef's special chicken. We were not at all impressed with the chicken dish. It was very rich and creamy but it lacked flavor. I did enjoy iskender, and thought that the gyro meat was flavorful and of better quality than most gyro meat. The meat was plentiful and both dishes were of decent portions. We also enjoyed the fresh baked bread that was served to us before the entrees came out.   I would like to come back and try another dish, but I probably won't because of the high prices. Most meat dishes were in the $15-$20 range which is a bit much especially at lunch. They do have a lunch menu but it is not offered on weekends, so our lunch was around $40 for two of us and we didn't have drinks or appetizers. Downtown, maybe, but Avon? It just is placed in an odd location for such prices.   The service was quick and friendly. Parking was not as issue as this place is in a strip shopping center with plenty of space."}
{"text":"OMG, I love this place! Visited while in Cleveland last week at an Exposition at the IX Center. I have so missed Doner Kebabs and Turkish food in general like is so easy to find back in my homeland in the UK, and this place really did the trick! There is nothing like it closer to home in the Buffalo NY area. It is the one food from home that I really miss. I would strongly and whole heartedly recommend Istanbul Grill to anyone and everyone. The Doner kebabs and chicken shish kebabs are fabulous, and I could drink the Turkish Tea continuously for days! People of Cleveland, Westlake, Elyria: You are so lucky to have this gem in your midst! Please go and try it. I am certain you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, very authentic, delicious flavors. Would highly recommend. Not necessarily a high end restaurant ambiance wise, but very comfortable and cute.  We went for lunch and had told them it was our first time eating there. The owner gave us a complimentary dessert that was homemade and absolutely delicious.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I usually split the combination plate and it is delicious! We both have different favorites, but everything we've tried is delicious. The bread with two dips is a great start to the meal. The red sauce is spicy but the tzatziki is cool and tempers the heat."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Ordered the sampler and the red lentil soup.  Both were memorable enough to go back again."}
{"text":"Phenomenal meat dishes await your culinary critique at Dervish. The kabobs are out of this world, especially the lamb. I was disappointed not to find Turkish beer on the menu , but the wine looked good. Service was very friendly and prompt. Don't be fooled by the strip mall location, the food is excellent and worth a journey. The cold appetizer sampler was also quite good and I loved the bread and hummus."}
{"text":"The hummus was served with freshly baked bread and tasted very authentic. However, one of our entrées was not very easy on the stomach. My boyfriend ordered the Doner Gyro platter, he stated it \"tasted like dog food.\" He proceeded to continue to try and palette it, but every piece of meat tasted the same. I had to try it to make sure he was not imagining things, and I had to agree with him. I could not continue to eat my meal once I tasted his."}
{"text":"Oh god! This restaurant is the doorway to culinary heaven. Tried Mixed Grill, Lamb Adana with Yogurt, Istanbul Signature, Chicken Shish and Falafel.  One cannot go wrong in ordering these food items. The chef knows what he/she is doing. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good food, strictly Mediterranean though. Staff is very friendly. Goat cheese pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"Ever since Falafel Cafe closed I have been looking for an equal replacement for their veggie and mixed grill sampler platters. I have found this and more at Istanbul Mediterranean Grill! Sure, it's about $20 more expensive, but oooohh is it tasty.   *Sigara Boregi $ 7.99 - phyllo dough stuffed with feta. I dipped these in this cucumber yogurt sauce. Pretty good.  *Mixed Appetizer (small) $16.99 - delicious hummus, smokey baba, sweet grape leaf, cool lebni, chunky eggplant sauce, and tabouli. Oh my such great flavors! They give you some homemade Turkish round bread to rip apart and soak up the goods with.  *Mixed Grill $26.99 - overpriced, but lots of meat: beef, chicken, lamb with rice.  *Baklava $5.49 -  four small pieces. Tasty, just a lot of syrup.  They also have Turkish versions of hot sauce, garlic sauce, and yogurt sauce.  Overall, I was happily surprised by the portion size and flavors of the food. Easily 3-4 meals depending on your appetite or amount of guests. I look forward to leftovers! I know this place is pricier than the fast casual spots around town, but honestly, it's worth it. While I won't get this all of the time, it will definitely be added to my list of good Mediterranean places to treat myself at."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Thursday night.  It was not very busy, and by the time we left, it was still half-full at best.  As others have noted, it's a shame because this is a quality spot, and it does speak to the collective palette of the community.  As a former east-sider, I have observed the lack of quality non-chain establishments in the Avon area.  I suppose the silver lining is that I don't have to share the better spots with too many others...yet.  As for this place, the food was good.  My wife commented that it tasted like we were eating home-cooked food, which is a nice of a compliment you can pay to a restaurant.  My one nitpick was that there is no pita-style bread for hummus and tabouleh, and the bread they serve, while tasty, doesn't exactly do the trick.  On the other hand, the mixed grill I split with my daughter was fantastic.  Lamb, chicken, gyro meat and steak - all were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The service was very attentive.  Just in case it hasn't been noted, they don't serve beer/wine, but do allow you to BYOB, which I will keep in mind for next time.  Quality spot...we'll be back."}
{"text":"Don't recommend during Ramadan The food was cold the service was disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!!! , they never offers to discount my cold 3 hr late food ! I always spend $500 when I take my family there ,Will never go back , very rude for not offering any apologies for there terrible service"}
{"text":"We didn't order dinner; just the calamari  and baba ganoush appetizer. Calamari was not good tasting and very small portion! Particularly for $10, you can get much better elsewhere!  If you're in the mood for calamari, order it from an Italian restaurant and I could name a few (Peppers in Lakewood for one which is excellent and similar price but so much tastier).  The baba was pretty good - meaty and not stringy, but for $7 which only includes one piece of bread, certainly not enough bread for sharing, I wouldn't order the baba from here again.  We ordered an extra piece of bread and that was $1.50!  Perhaps it's the location but we think the prices are high compared to elsewhere.  We were in the area and stopped in; otherwise, we won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I had okra. The dish is presented really well. I got bulghur on the side. The food is prepared to the taste of an average American customer. I would say that the dishes I have tasted were little bit different than the original Turkish cuisine. For example, in Turkish cuisine , peppers at okra dish are sauteed more ... Overall it was good. If you are going to try Turkish food for the first time, I think you will love it here."}
{"text":"This place is just awesome.  Mixed grill is the bomb.  Service is excellent.  Been coming here for years.  I am a foodie and I'd pick this place over and over again.  Kid friendly too!  You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Do not miss this great Turkish restaurant. Great food, friendly and helpful staff. Red lentil soup fantastic. People are so nice and everything made from scratch. Will return for sure!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I love the \"Istanbul Signature! Yum! If you want great Mediterranean food, then try this authentic array of delightful dishes!"}
{"text":"Good Food. Portion size is good. I have had better middle eastern food in general so thats y 3 starts. overall good experience i will say..."}
{"text":"Our favorite Turkish restaurant. The food is delicious.  One of my favorites is the eggplant and tomato sauce appetizer. The waiters are very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for over 8 years, the food and staff are wonderful. The BEST baba ghanoush, sigara boregi, stuffed grape leaves, just get the appetizer platter......it's my favorite thing ever. The bread and dips are heaven. My husband doesn't like chicken at all....except the shish kabab here, he loves it, we all do. The chicken with yogurt is great, you get the delicious chicken chunks with croutons smothered in a yogurt and red sauce. Soooooooo good. Honestly, it's all good. After dinner, we get the kunefe, do yourself a favor and save room for it. My kids love coming to dinner here as well, it's one of their favorite places. I can't say enough about the wonderful owners and wait staff here, we feel like family every time we come."}
{"text":"I want to be clear and start with I finally created a Yelp for the sole purpose of letting everybody know how dreadful this place is. I grew up in an Italian family on one side and a Lebanese family on the other. I'm quite familiar with, and a big fan off, all foods that fall under the large \"Mediterranean\" umbrella, so I have no bias against this style of food. Though I am no expert in Turkish food, I did have the experience of eating at this location when it was called  Dervish (or something similar to that). At the time I found it a little pricey to frequent regularly but not too bad for what it was. It had a freshness and \"authentic\" quality about it that wasn't quite enough to justify it's price tag but it was pretty good nonetheless. I waited some time after it changed hands to Istanbul to give the new brand a chance to work out the bugs and growing pains of opening a new restaurant. tried it this evening. I ordered the Chicken Shish Kabob with yogurt and tomato butter sauce. I asked if the dish would come with any bread. The waitress said that they brought out bread before the meal. I asked if my dish specifically came with the bread that was offered under the side dishes or should I order a side. She said it would come with bread on the side. It did not, it came with croutons mixed inside of it. Unseasoned, white, croutons. The bread that was brought prior to our dishes coming out was stale. It came with two sides of sauce. One was a passable tzatziki sauce which was a little heavy on the dill but o.k.. The other was a cold, canned tomato sauce with crushed red peppers in it and no other discernible flavor. It was a little gross. My wife ordered the Vegetarian Saute. It came with a side of rice and was hot. I mention this because my dish did not come with a side of rice (for 15.99 I feel it ought to have) nor was it hot. It was lukewarm. The Vegetarian Saute for $13.99 was edible, though it did taste to me almost exactly like Campbell's canned Vegetable Soup- which is pretty good, but not 13.99 good if you not what I mean. My Kabob dish was lukewarm, parts of it cold. It came smothered in a sauce that tasted just like the canned garbage that came with the bread minus the crushed red peppers so had even less flavor. It was poured over plain white yogurt that had been drizzled over my chicken. There were these white crouton chunks scattered about the dish. There were a FEW pieces of green pepper an onions. The chicken itself had grill marks on it however while the outside was luke warm (parts of it were actually cold where cold yogurt had been heaped on it) the center was cold suggesting it had been cooked long before and then re-heated, explaining 7 minute turn-around time to get it out after we ordered. The chicken was gamey at best. I stole some of my wife's rice (I would have asked for my own but nobody every returned to our table) to put the chicken on and mix in some of the yogurt and \"sauce\" that came on it. It was terrible. I added a bunch of salt, pepper, and some of the tzatziki sauce left over from the stale bread and ate a few bites because I was starving at the time. Though it had more flavor than when it first came out it was not enough to mask how disgusting it tasted. There is really no other word more descriptive than \"disgusting\" to convey how it was. I would have liked to maybe send it back to try something else but nobody ever came back to our table. It was 7:45 on a Monday night, two other tables that had already been served, and with a host and two servers nobody came back to ask how the food was, refill our drinks, or ask if there was anything else we needed. My wife ate some of hers because she was hungry as well and it was far more edible than mine. We mostly just sat there with full dishes of food in front of us for what seemed like ages before I angrily looked around my shoulder at the group of employees standing by the register and caught somebody's attention. Our waitress came over and asked how everything was. \"Not very good,\" I said and looked at my full plate of food. \"Oh, that's too bad!\" She said. \"Can I bring you a box?\" She followed. \"No\". So she brought the check without saying a word, not a sorry, not a \"is there anything else I can get you?\", not a, \"here, let me see if I can get this fellow that's been standing here doing nothing all night who appears to be the owner or manager because he frequently goes outside on his phone and comes in looking angry but still does nothing to perhaps comp some of the meal for you\". Full bill, full price for everything, still no refill on even our water, takes my card, brings it back without saying thank-you. We left and as we're walking out she musters a \"Have a good day.\". I can tolerate bad customer service if the food is exceptional. I can tolerate mediocre food if the atmosphere is nice and the service is exceptional. I can not fathom why anybody, anywhere, ever, would want to come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Used to be Dervish grill in the past, always heard good things and wanted to try it. Made it there recently, new management continued the excellent service and most importantly, the food was PHENOMENAL. The dervish salad was very fresh and great.  We ordered the grill mix tray, we had to order a second as it was delicious. The taste and texture of the meat reminded me of the same food I had in Istanbul Turkey I had last summer while on vacation. Dessert was just perfect.  Continue the good work. Highly highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A must visit. The food and service was exceptional. We enjoyed the cold sampler appetizers and the main dish sampler. We had my daughter visiting with us and we are planning a return visit before she returns to her home."}
{"text":"This is a great place that offers authentic Middle Eastern food. I would definitely go there again and take my family. The appetizers were great and the customer service was better."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best restaurants in Avon area , I went there with my wife recently and we both liked their food a lot , we started with Kibbeh and Baba Ganosh and both of them were incredible. After that we I had Sultan delight which is minced lamb served over purée of eggplant and cheese , it was fabulous and tasty . My wife had their Eskander Kabob which was also delicious, portions were huge , the prices are reasonable for the portions and quality ."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife and son. We ordered 4 different appetizers. The tabouli is amazing!"}
{"text":"Omg!!!  This place is one of favorites spot in Avon. Steak kabobs are outstanding. Perfectly grilled and amazing flavors. Make sure you order it medium rear otherwise it comes out well done!  On Sunday's they have these meat pizzas that are highly recommended. Should be a daily item if you ask me!  Service is always friendly. Knafa desert is amaaaaazing  Take out works very well!!"}
{"text":"WE LOVE ISTANBUL!!   Everyone in my family has their favorites, but mine are the chicken adana and chicken shish. The spices and sauces pop in your mouth! I always ask for the bulgur instead of the rice pilaf and they gladly oblige. Husband loves chicken saute and lamb adana. Kids love the gyro and chicken veg soup. We are regulars here, and hope this place sticks around for a long time! A great Avon establishment with incredibly yummy eats. Two thumbs up, five stars, an A+ and three smiley faces :) :) :)"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here on a Sunday. Beautiful inside, so clean and very interesting pictures on the walls. The staff is aware of all your needs before you even have to ask. Great vibes  Food was excellent. Came out hot and tasty. Even the water was magical. Im definitely traveling back here before the summer is out."}
{"text":"My family and I have dined here many times over the years. This is one of those rare places about which I can honestly say - I have never had a bad meal here!   From the 'zucchini pancakes' to the 'vegetable sauté' to the 'rice pudding' - oh, that 'rice pudding' topped with cream and cinnamon - just close your eyes and point a finger at the menus and order - you can't go wrong!   P.S. The 'chicken adona' is my wife's fave - and if you happen to go on a weekend, ask for the 'pizza' :)"}
{"text":"Ate here last week for light dinner... Bowl of red lentil soups and cold appetizer sampler.  Being Greek, our history with Turks is less than amicable...but screw history, these guys know how to cook. Everything was great! Other dishes being served looked delis as well. I never give 5 stars (needs to be heaven on a plate) and I don't easily doll out 4 stars, but this one was easy.  You can't miss here. What a pleasure!"}
{"text":"Everything we tried was simply delicious! I took my 82-year-old mother there for an early dinner. She had kabobs, while I had chicken in cream sauce and rice pilaf. Everything tasted fresh and lightly seasoned. I was stuffed, but kept eating since it was so good! We also purchased desserts to go.   The wait staff was attentive without being overbearing. I'm a huge water drinker and my glass was never half empty.  I love giving my money to local family restaurants instead of the many chains.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best chicken/meat I've tasted in my life! .. I highly recommend trying their chicken shish and lamb Adana. The chicken/meat is so tender, juicy, and rich in flavor.   The owners and staff are super friendly and very helpful. My family and I have been there at least 20 times over the past year. The food has been consistently perfect. I can't recommend going to this restaurant enough!"}
{"text":"I've been getting take-out from here for years. Delicious every time!! The friendliest staff ever!!  Wish the location was better for them! Everyone needs to know about this place!!"}
{"text":"Very good. Some of the best middle eastern food I've had. The knafa tbh is my favorite thing about this place, for it's not too sweet and heavy it's perfect."}
{"text":"Best Turkish food in the city hands down! The lahmacun is very good and the iskander kabab is excellent! We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Well worth the stop. We were driving from back from Michigan to NYC (our home town) and decided to stop somewhere for dinner and said let's give this place a shot from the yelp reviews. Thank god We stop, better then any Turkish food we ever tried back home in NYC. We got the mix grill meat and hummus. The bread was to die for the meat was tender and juice and fresh. Great food great service was great."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and a pretty fair price. Good falafel, hummus, and salads. My only issue with this facility is the service. I have been here several times and the staff is not attentive and doesn't communicate well. One of the times I went I ordered hummus but they didn't bring out any pita bread with it like the menu stated so I asked for it and the waitress said she would go get it but then stood at the front desk. After about 5 minutes I went to the counter (where she had been the entire time) to ask again she said \"yeah it's in the oven\" if she had communicated that initially I wouldn't have had to go to the counter asking for it... I felt like kind of a fool. I have had other issues with the service as well. The food is delicious so I will definitely return but probably only for takeout."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Dined in one Saturday evening, kabab was perfectly cooked and the baklava and Turkish coffee topped it all off. Great little spot for something different in Avon!  Be salâmati!"}
{"text":"What was formerly called Dervish is now called Istanbul. First and foremost I noticed the diversity of the customers. Loved seeing the diverse crowd! I noted that a couple brought in a bottle of their own wine, which the staff happily served to the couple.    There were 9 people in our party. The selection of entrees, appetizers, and accompaniments is excellent. We had a Turkish guest with us who understood the food. The food is all home made, down to the authentic baklava.  Everything is freshly prepared and it tasted scrumptious! The bread provided before our meal with a yogurt and hot sauce was ssssooo good. The hot sauce is fiery and wonderful!! The iskander kabob is prepared authentically. The mixed grill, O M G, perfect with all the fave kabobs and rice in a plate.   We ended our dinner with Turkish chai! A perfect cup of soft chai that helped digest our amazing meals."}
{"text":"RELAXING ENVIRONMENT WITH TURKISH COFFEE BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED THE RICE!       I really do regret writing this review but the near health hazard and mistake I experienced at Istanbul I cannot overlook.  I will start at the beginning.  I LOVE middle eastern style foods and trying all different kinds/tastes.  I also love trying new things (especially food).  When I saw this establishment with my roommate, we DEFINITELY wanted to try it out.  Arriving at Istanbul is a bit difficult at the time of writing this review because currently there is construction around the area and the street just outside the parking lot.  Upon arrival you see a simple entrance with flat, tall glass windows and a few tables outside.  When you walk in, you first see a small bar in front of you and tables on your left that carry on all the way to back where the restrooms are.  There is approximately 2 dozen tables and we were seated at one of the booths closer to the bar.  Very comfortable actually.  Looking over the menu I wanted to try a lamb dish with a side of rice and relish.  Before the food arrived, we ordered their Turkish coffee and it was a delight and probably the best part of the meal.  When the food arrived, I was immediately thrown off by the \"shiny\" object in my rice right on top.  I had NO idea what it was so I took my fork and looked it over.  IT WAS A STEEL FLAKE!  YES!  THERE WAS METAL IN MY RICE!  I immediately called over the waiter and asked, \"What do you guys clean your pots with?\"  as I pointed to the metal flake on my plate.  He looked at it and almost started laughing saying, \"Oh, that's my Brillo Pad.\"  WHAT!?!?!  You scrubbed the pot but didn't wash it?!?  I couldn't believe that!  He then said,  \"I'll get you some more rice.\"  I was skeptical on the rice so I concentrated on the lamb which was actually well prepared with NO metal flakes from a Brillo Pad.  He brought back the rice and because I was hungry I decided to sift through it and give it a try.  I did not see anymore Brillo Pad.  Overall, I give this place TWO stars because of the Turkish coffee being the only delight and we will NOT be returning.  They still had me pay FULL PRICE for my meal because I \"finished the lamb\".  Unacceptable after finding a piece of Brillo pad in my rice!  I could have seriously been injured or cut myself.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with great food and always fresh ingredients! They have special dish every Sunday called lahem beajeen ! You have to try it. Very friendly owners and staff. Keep referring my friends and they always come back happy !!"}
{"text":"Out of towner looking for something good and healthy.  I read all the reviews here on Yelp and went.  I gotta say I totally agree.  I never eat big, but boy oh boy I did last night.    Tried all kinds of things; from the sampler appetizer plate to chicken and lamb. I even had dessert and coffee. Heck, even the decaf was good....not to mention the baklava.  Very nice portions and plating. Honestly for a road warrior and foody to be this satisfied is an accomplishment.   Service was great too.  And fast!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new and I saw the good reviews here on Yelp and was not disappointed. The food was great and the service was very helpful. They do something magical with eggplant here! I will definitely be coming back to try more of what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Finally, some real food in the chain restaurant wasteland that is Avon/Avon Lake. Went here last night with the family, and had a wonderful experience.  Pros: - The service was wonderful. We had our 3 year old and 1 year old, and they treated the kids like little royalty. Always more than appreciated. - The food. I had the falafel platter, while my wife had the doner plate, and we were thrilled. It's not the greasy quasi meat doner of countless Austrian food stalls, but it was wonderful.  - The kids menu had real food options, so our son had rice pilaf and doner meat. He was really happy and ate most of his meal.  - My falafel was perfect. Obviously hand made, with a crunchy outside, perfect spice, and a delicious inside. The hummus it was served with was great, too. Both kids ate spoonfuls of the hummus, it was so tasty.    Cons: - People around here don't go there, and instead queue at Applebees for dinner. This is no con on Istanbul, but an indictment of the people that surround me daily.  We will definitely be back, and work to get our friends to go, too."}
{"text":"If you love lamb, you MUST go to Istanbul. The lamb kabobs are one of top 5 things I have ever eaten. Incredible! If you don't love lamb they have many options you will enjoy.   The Shepard Salad is prepared perfectly. This is a simple salad that must be prepared with great restraint so the dressing does not overwhelm the contents. They hit it right every time!  Portions are large and the food quality is much better than you might expect from restaurant located in a strip mall.  Atmosphere is nothing to write about but the staff is efficient, friendly and professional. They are happy to explain and recommend, they have never steered us wrong. The owner is on premises almost every time we have been there."}
{"text":"This little gem is fabulous! Starting with the amazing, fresh and delicious hummus with homemade pita bread! On to a delicious salad and chicken kabob! Service was wonderful, food was delicious! Highly recommend this place! :)"}
{"text":"I have been to Istanbul multiple times and it is one of my favorite go to spots.  The food has always been excellent and at reasonable prices. I love the Turkish tea.  Of course we all know that Turkish coffee is wild as its so thick and powerful as you get to the bottom there is no equal in terms of intensity.  I liken it to ground stones but its just thick coffee and I nearly always get a cup at the end of my meal.  Lovely interior, convenient location and friendly staff. Cool pictures of Turkey on the walls. The Turkish coffee comes in a beautiful silver like cup with a cover a beautiful and elegant presentation."}
{"text":"Best Middle eastern food in Ohio and I've been to many of them. Always very good service and the food never disappoints. Great place!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and tasty food, with excellent vegetarian options and great family owned service.  And be sure to try the Turkish coffee!"}
{"text":"My sister and I tried this restaurant on Saturday based on the five stars and reviews.   They did not disappoint. We had the Baba Ganoush and fried calamari to start.  Both were delicious.   I had the Chef's Chicken and it was so full of flavor.   There were plenty of leftovers that my husband later enjoyed.   When I am in the area again (I live about 40 minutes away), I will definitely return to this place.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"When this place had the previous owner it was 10 times better. I went here 3 times after they changed the name to try to give it another chance because of how much I liked it when it was named dervish under a different owner the meat and chicken were not cooked all the way and were very rubbery the lentil soup was watery for the money we spent was not worth it! Plus the cups and utensils were all dirty!! I really wanted to like this place again because of it being halal but jst didn't work out :-/"}
{"text":"Great place and wonderful staff. The food is excellent although it's a bit pricey for a casual evening out. The service was very good and I can't say enough about the wait staff and the warm and friendly greeting. Very welcoming and a varied menu makes for a nice change of pace from the usual burger joints and chain restaurants in the area. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I must admit that I too was confused about the old name and new name situation and I had to call to be sure they were still open.  Having said that, I have been to this location under the previous name and under the new name, Istanbul Grill.  The same very nice and highly pleasant gentleman waited on me each time and it was a joy to interact with him and hear his enthusiasm for the menu and each dish.  At his recommendation, for dinner I had the Sultan's \"Hunker Begendi\" and it was super delicious!  I also had the Mediterranean Salad and the Baklava and it too was fantastic.  If you are after great Mediterranean food and the nicest server you would ever want to have, then this is your place what ever the name is on the front door."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Fresh food, great service everytime! We bring in a bottle of wine, order the sampler app. And have never been disappointed. Their chicken and lamb dishes are some of our favorites as well, so tender and always well prepared."}
{"text":"LOVE their Lahmacun! They have only have it on Sundays but even that's enough. The taste is perfect, and the portion is large (3 lahmacuns) so you are definitely full! It's so hard to find proper lahmacun in the US, I have to travel 40min. to get there but it's well worth the trip, and we often even just to take out as well.   The ambience of the restaurant, cleanliness, and friendliness of the staff is also great. Everything is halal and they don't serve alcohol, which is a plus for me."}
{"text":"Seriously. It's the best falafel in town. We've visited 4 times in the past few months and have never been disappointed. Get the Turkish coffee or the Turkish tea. Don't fill up on the amazing bread they'll bring you before your meal. Even the peppers and tomatoes served with the falafel are grilled to perfection and delicious. My daughter suggested with move to Avon so we can be closer to this restaurant, and if you knew our family you'd know how crazy an idea that is. The wait staff is excellent, attentive, fast, and genuinely friendly. There are have always been Turkish customers eating in the restaurant when we go ...that's really how you know a place is legit."}
{"text":"Wow, what an amazing experience.  The cold appetizer sampler platter was a great introduction to the wide variety of offerings here.  The waitress explained each one and even the kids enjoyed trying a bite of something new.  Had the cabbage rolls for my entree and they almost melted in your mouth.  The tomato sauce was mild but flavorful, with the yogurt sauce also adding a unique touch.  Just when we were completely stuffed, the dessert menu came out and we just had to try the baklava and the milk custard roll.  Best ever!  Clean, interesting atmosphere, knowledgeable and friendly service, this place has my highest recommendation."}
{"text":"This is by far the best.  The food authentic,the staff gracious, the music perfectly volumed for quiet atmosphere.  It is my favorite place to dine."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were in Avon and were in the mood for trying a new place. The service was excellent! Our waiter took his time explaining different dishes and gave us great recommendations. To begin we both got Turkish tea, which  I highly recommend. We ordered the mixed appetizer, it allowed us to try the majority of their appetizers. For our main course we ordered mixed grill. By ordering the mixed grill were again able to try the majorly of the meats that this restaurant has to offer. For dessert we got kadayif, it was delicious and a perfect way to end our meal.  All of the ingredients were fresh and we had impeccable service. I enjoyed sampling all of the dishes and will be coming back! Keep up the great work!"}
