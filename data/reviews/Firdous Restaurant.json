{"text":"Still a fan of this place, wish more people would try this over Bamiyon. The owner deserves the love. He knows his BBQ and is passionate about serving great Afghani/Persian food."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer Service.. they need a uniform policy ( the owner wore a dress shirt that was stained and completely wrinkled) The food seemed it was cooked a couple days prior to our visit and it just sat in the fridge until they had us \"the customer\" to serve it to. I would not recommend this place to anyone I care about. There are better choices out there. DO NOT EAT HERE. BEWARE!"}

{"text":"I just had to sign up with Yelp and post a review of this restaurant because of how unsatisfied I am with this restaurant and their shady practices. When I saw on Teambuy that they had an offer for this restaurant which was $10 for $20 worth of food, tax included, I was very interested. The picture of the kabobs looked very tasty so I decided to buy 3 vouchers. 

My first visit, I ordered a Sultani Kabob combo $12.49 and Chicken Tikka Tandoori (No Combo) $6.99. The total should have came up to $22.12 but somehow it came up to almost $27 from what I remember. I questioned how the total could cost so much and they said they made a mistake and charged me a combo for both so they re-calculated the order. This time, it came up to $25 and change which still did not seem right so I asked for a receipt. They said they could not give me a receipt because I used a voucher but can write one up manually for me. The manual receipt had no calculations but just what I ordered and what the total was so I asked them how they reached a total of $25 and change. Then they said, we charged you for bread, you want bread right? I did not mention that I wanted bread but I was already frustrated so I just took the bread. He said, next time, if you don't want bread, just say so. 

(Note: In take out menu booklet, the combo said it includes naan, however, the pictures above their front counter and on their website of their combos and prices do not show bread so I don't know what's correct.) 

My second visit, I bought the Tikka Kabob combo and Chicken Tikka Breast Combo, both costing $9.99 each and I said no bread so I was expecting a total $22.58. So the cashier punches in my order and again, $25 and some change. I reiterated to him that I do not want bread so he recalculated it again and it came to $22.58. Finally he got it right. I wanted to point out in their take out menu that it says \"Naan included\" but I didn't want to upset the him since I had one more voucher to use there and am paranoid of having my food tampered with.

My third visit, I ordered the same as my second visit and again, I was overcharged and it came up to $29  and change. I advised him that $9.99 + $9.99 + tax is not $29 and change so he recalculated it and said $25 and change. Then I said I didn't want bread so they recalculated it and said $22.58. Now when I get my meal, they didn't bother to ask me what kind of dressing I wanted with the salad and just put ranch when I wanted Italian. I also asked for extra chutney and his response was, I have to charge you for it, this is a business. Yet, I saw him give the two customers before me extra chutney for free. Not sure if it was a racial thing or because I used a voucher but I didn't care anymore.

On a side note, the food is decent. Not great but not bad but I will never come back to this place as they always try to overcharge you any way they can. Especially with their practice of charging you extra for bread and when you don't even ask for it."}
