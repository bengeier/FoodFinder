{"text":"Love this place.  Restaurant manager was incredibly nice and accommodating.    My cherry mimosa was really good and so was my lobster and prosciutto benedict!    My friend got the board and it was the third time she's gotten it (so assuming that's a good sign!).   It was a little quiet when we arrived on a Sunday so I really hope this place survives.   It is next to Central Kitchen (replaced OKRA)."}
{"text":"Let me tell you this is a must restaurant in the valley awesome food pizza unreal wife had the shrimp scampi she loved it service off the charts you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"We had a perfect evening at Pubblico Italian Eatery!  The service and food were amazing! We shared the smoked salmon and pesto bruschetta and the caprese salad, and I had the Seafood Fettucine while my husband had the spinach ravioli. We also shared the creme brûlée.  It was all delicious!!  We will definitely be making this a new regular dining spot.  It's our new favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious! Came here for a rare date night and it was special without being over the top. We had the shrimp scampi as an appetizer (I had an Italian margarita too...yum!!). Definitely recommend. The restaurant is airy yet cozy at the same time. Exceptional service."}
{"text":"This place is the best find ever. From The bartenders and the servers to the ambiance and decor. It is a win from the moment you walk through the doors. I was there for a preview of their brunch menu and don't take my word for it, go and try it firsthand, it is absolutely delicious. We had a charcuterie board and the prosciutto and lobster eggs Benedict, both were beautiful presentations and ever better tasting. We were definitely members of the clean plate club. The drinks were also great! My favorite was the publicco fizz with gin in place of the vodka, it is dangerously delicious. The best part are the prices, for what we got I would expect to be paying a pretty penny, but everything was beyond reasonable for the quality and quantity. I mean $3 mimosas! I'll definitely be going back and wouldn't be surprised if it becomes my new go to brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Our meal was fantastic! The Rigatoni was 5 star and the service was great. The interior was clean but very very noisy."}
{"text":"This place is EVIL!    You definitely need to stay away from Mozzarella Carrozza! PURE EVIL YUMMY YUMMY GOODNESS!  We devoured it and had to order a second one...wait...I mean the dog ate it...yeah that's it.  Butternut Squash Gnocchi was pan-fried as well...SOOOOO good!  My wife had a hard time sharing it with me!  The Rigatoni was absolutely amazing!  It has a nice smoke flavor from the brick oven!  Nice amount of meat in the sauce and it worked well with the second piece of Mozzarella Carrozza!  We will definitely be back and soon!"}
{"text":"This place just opened today and WOW! The service is great. Bartenders are beautiful. Food out of this world. Pubblico is a must try."}
{"text":"P.I.E. is everything we thought it would be. The reviews of the food are spot on. First, our waiter was Manny and he was GREAT!  He knew the menu like the backside of his hand and his recommendations were on par!!! We had a couple of appetizers, shrimp scampi and calamari, and both were fantastic! The marinara for the calamari was just like grandma's sauce!   For entrees, we ordered the Cioppino and Beef Risotto. Unfortunately, they were out of Lobster. However, the owner (Danny) quickly came over and apologized. He not only offered a solution but also poured us a tasty 5 oz of whiskey.  They also added additional clams and scallops to the dish! The risotto is made to order and done to perfection!!!! The home made pasta didn't disappoint and the sauce for the Cioppino was so delicious!   The owner was extremely attentive and our waiter was great!     We will definitely make this place a regular stop on our Friday or Saturday night dinners!!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place just opened yesterday and I see us becoming regulars. The decor is warm and friendly with a modern twist, and we looked out onto the patio which we hope to sit soon.  Service was exceptional, as was my wine and my husband's old fashioned.  But dinner was amazing, from the bruschetta to the really lovely caesar salad, and our entrees were amazing.  You must have the seafood fettuccine. I don't want to spoil it for you but you'll be ecstatic that you did. We ended our meal with tiramisu, which was yummy. With all of the restaurants on 7th Street that have opened in our North Central Phoenix neighborhood we still hadn't found our \"Cheers\" until now.  What a great addition!"}
{"text":"Definitely a spot to go to if you're looking for some belly warming Italian food. The restaurant is in the space that Okra was in, and has a similar layout. The decor is pretty simple but nice. It looks like they have added an outdoor bar area that I don't remember from before. Looks like a fun hangout spot.  We both had a glass of wine. The list is brief but appropriate for the size of the restaurant, and we enjoyed both glasses. I had the rigatoni and the SO had a pizza. Both were delicious. The rigatoni was a baked cheesy pile of yum, which was just what I was looking for at the time. To me it was a generous portion, took some leftovers home.  Our server was lovely. Pleasant, attentive and helpful. Overall, would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"So happy with this place! Walked up there on Friday evening without a reservation but we were able to sit at the bar. Both of the servers were fantastic! Very attentive even though every seat and table in the place was filled.   My cocktail was excellent and reasonably priced. The presentation of a non-alcoholic drink was very nice.   The food... GREAT!! My pet-peeve with Italian is that marinara sauce shouldn't taste like, and be full of sugar!! Pubblico's wasn't! It tasted like tomatos and was fresh with the right combination of spices. It was fabulous.   Also, I don't remember seeing any T.V.s behind the bar. I could be wrong, but after we got home, I realized that I hadn't seen any. Maybe someone can verify that. If there are no T.V.s, I will love this place even MORE!  Try it out. You won't be disappointed. Also, you'll be helping keep this great place in my neighborhood for me! :-) Thank you."}
{"text":"Great food well done but short in overall management as are allowing just about every thing being marinated in garlic marinade even their fish. This is a lazy chefs way and a insult to the many garlic intolerant and allergic folks. Place has too many hard surfaces and so very loud"}
{"text":"Best Gcnocchi I've had in Phoenix. The atmosphere is casual with amazing food. House drinks are all spectacular and the wait staff are friendly and awesome. We ordered the pesto penne, pepperoni pizza and GNOCCHI which were all amazing, fresh, and home made. One of the best experiences I've had in a while. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Alright so this place is great! Super intimate, shrimp and scallop wasn't over cooked. Quick service, beautiful building. Wasn't busy on Monday night. We started with a Romana salad (Cesar salad), a Strawberry Gorgonzola salad, and a shrimp scampi. Food came out quick even tho I only saw two or three kitchen staff on hand.   For entrees, we got the lobster ravioli and a Pubblico pizza (prosciutto and arugula) the lobster ravioli is priced, but it comes out with two fat ass prawns and a damn scallop that's perfectly EFFIN COOKED. I'm getting hyped right now just thinking about it.. great value!!   The lobster ravioli is loaded with meat, strong notes of rosemary, pasta is made in house. The pizza, pretty good, the prosciutto was a little tough.   If you're debating between mora and this place.. save yourself money and come here. 2 people, lots of food, 73$ did not purchase dessert.  THANK YOU PUBBLICO. 4 stars because the ravioli could have been hotter, also, there's a strange lingering bathroom smell or maybe cleaning product smell."}
{"text":"My family came here to celebrate my grandmothers 89th birthday. They had a large table set up for us, and allowed us to bring in our own cake, which was a very nice gesture.   The décor was beautiful. It felt very hip and modern.  The staff was attentive and went the extra mile for our large group.   Though the restaurant has high chairs, they don't have a kids menu - which is why I docked a star. It's tough to get a toddler to enjoy Butternut Squash Gnocchi when deep down he just wants chicken nuggets. Also, kids menus are a great form of entertainment. The amazing waitress brought him scratch paper and a pen, which I felt was above and beyond.   This is a great spot to take a date, not a fantastic spot to bring your toddlers/kids."}
{"text":"We were invited to the pre-opening so we got to try a lot of different menu items that we normally wouldn't order. All of the appetizers and salads were great. The Shrimp Scampi appetizer was our favorite. All of our entrees were also really good. The restaurant decor and overall atmosphere were very nice & inviting. I am definitely recommending this place to friends."}
{"text":"So we at here last night to test it out before we brought our husbands in.  We ordered a lot of food so we could taste multiple things (yes, we had left overs).  We ordered the mozzarella carrozza, cauliflower steak polenta, butternut squash gnocchi and the beef risotto.  Every single dish was absolutely delicious!  Of course we had to end the evening with the scrumptious tiramisu.  Pubblico Italian Eatery is a WONDERFUL addition to our neighborhood and I look forward to dinning here again very soon."}
{"text":"My best friend had her birthday party here a few weeks ago on the patio and it was so lovely! The weather was perfect and the ambiance divine. I was so excited when she picked this spot because I had been dying to try it. It is such a great addition to 7th street, and walking distance from so many fun places to hit up after you enjoy a delicious Italian dinner here.  Their patio is small, but shady and perfect for a small group gathering. There were about 24 of us who had dinner. We took up pretty much the entire patio, there were a few more tables besides our party. They had waiters walking around taking orders for the first hour while we drank and mingled. My house chardonnay was refreshing and delicious! I ended up getting a second glass.   To start, we tried their Antipasto Board that was absolutely incredible! It had an array of meats, smoked salmon, cheeses, veggies, hummus, and toasted flatbread. It is a great starter for a table! While their homemade pasta dishes looked AMAZING, I was trying to stay on the healthy side since I had a week of indulging so I ordered the Cauliflower Steak Polenta from their Gluten Free portion of the menu. It is so neat that they offer great GF options. It was delicious! I did expect it to be a bit different (cauliflower in more of a 'steak' than florets) but the flavors were still fantastic. It had roasted cauliflower on a bed of corn polenta and was topped with loads of wild mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, and fresh basil. Then was drizzled with truffle and olive oil. My ONLY suggestions were that the polenta be a bit creamier (it got a little tough and was kind of dry by the time it got to me) and that there be more of a 'sauce' on it. Otherwise, I ate the entire thing and and enjoyed it!   All in all, this is a GREAT new spot and I can't wait to come back and try their homemade pastas. The service was super friendly and they were so kind to do individual checks for our huge party which is no easy task. I will be back soon! Also, the owner is SO passionate and was frequently making rounds to check in on all of the tables and offered great food suggestions. Love that!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this place out tonight and they said they weren't accepting any walk-ins until 8:30. Seems sort of ridiculous! Don't think I'll come back to try it. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Very nice place with a sophisticated, but laid back vibe.  The pasta is cooked perfectly.  Chicken Parm is delicious but a huge portion that can be split easily.  Sneaky good bourbon selection too ELT and StgJr!!!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for this Hot & New restaurant in the 7th Street corridor last Thursday night to check it out!  We were seated at the best table in the restaurant...inside, but right at the doors to feel like we were outside.  The atmosphere was lively, the service was super friendly and fun and the food was delicious and hearty.    I started with an El Presidio cocktail with vodka, pear, grapefruit and elderflower (so yummy), shared a spinach salad with cheese, pancetta, mangos and tomatoes with my hubby (loved that they split it for us) and each enjoyed our seafood risotto and beef risotto too.    We'll definitely be back when we're looking for Italian comfort food at reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Was there about a month ago and still thinking of the cauliflower polenta dish...amazing. Superior food.  Superior service. Cannot wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic and you're hearing from a guy who avoids Italian like the plague (to me \"Italian\" often means smothering white bread and pasta in red sauce and overcharging you for it).   This place has variety, ambience, a great wait staff....antipasto platter is ridiculous but everything we had was great.  Try to get Jose as your waiter...you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Before this space became Pubblico, it was a different restaurant called Okra. My fiancé and I had been to Okra once before (terrible service, which is prob why it went out of business lol), but I loved the restaurant itself. It has a great patio, and the look and feel of the restaurant is really fun. So when my sister told me that Okra had been replaced with Pubblico, I knew we had to try it. :)   Even on a busy Friday night, we were seated right away. Our waiter was super professional and friendly, and seemed like he had the perfect timing the whole night. He would always come up right when we were ready to order something, I don't know how he did it!   To start, I had a glass of wine and my fiancé had beer - not a huge selection of either, but plenty to choose from at the same time. We then ordered the Calamari as an appetizer, and it was delicious! We eat calamari everywhereee we go, and I thought the batter on Pubblico's was amazing. Marinara sauce with calamari isn't really my thing, but this is an Italian restaurant so it makes sense, and the sauce itself was bomb.   For dinner, we split the Pepperoni pizza - so good! It's not super big, but if you're not starving you can get away with sharing one. They don't skimp on the pepperoni at all, and it was made perfectly with just the right amount of tomato sauce and mozzarella.   After dinner I tried the Italian Margarita, which was really good, but I wouldn't recommend if you don't like the taste of tequila! ;)   Definitely can't wait to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"They just opened and will probably be around for awhile! Great food, friendly staff and convenient parking. Party of four All had different entrees and salads as well as two appetizers... All was great! Highly recommended, will be bringing friends back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious. Our food was perfect in every way. First of all, our hostesses over the phone were wonderful and easy to deal with when making reservations.   Then we were cordially and warmly taken care of by our server, Manny. We had drinks in no time and were given some recommendations on appetizers. Their bruschetta is pretty tasty! Even better, the bread was not overly toasted and hard. It was just the right crispness to enjoy the bruschetta without damaging the roof of my mouth! Win win. It was the Bresaola Fig & Tomato & Eggplant bruschetta that we had. I thoroughly enjoyed both!  Then I had the Lobster Ravioli whole my husband had the Lasagna. He finished his entire lasagna with no complaints. My Lobster ravioli also came with 2 jumbo shrimp and a jumbo scallop. Done to perfection! The shrimp had ever the crispness to them that left me wanting more! And let me just say that the Lobster Ravioli had me feeling quite satisfied for the price!  For dessert, Tiramisu! Oh sweet heavens they actually got this right! Not all tiramisu's are equal. Not too soaked, not too cakey. Just right!   Thank you, Pubblico! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Shared cauliflower and polenta and the salmon with a fig balsamic glaze. Both were really good. For dessert had the chocolate tart. Really great food. Would definitely recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wanted some good Italian after work in the Biltmore area. The wife and I stooped in. Happy hour was in effect. So, wine was $4 a glass and they have a very good selection of red and white. We ordered the stuffed bread app, which was very good! Not greasy or oily. The wife got mushroom ravioli and I got the Chicken Parm. Both were excellent. Nice serving size and pasta was cooked perfectly. Prices are extremely reasonable. We have tried several Italian joints in time. I highly recommend this place, plus in the fall/winter they have outdoor seating. We will make this a monthly visit for sure!"}
{"text":"Putting up this review a little late, but we tried this place out a few weeks ago after my sister and her fiancé recommended it. We went on a Friday night, and it wasn't too busy yet, so we were seated right away. That was great, but we were pretty disappointed because after the hostess dropped our waters off, no one came back to our table for a good 15-20 minutes. It was really surprising; normally it's one thing if someone comes by for a drink order and it's busy so the drinks take a while. But no one had even come by! We noticed a table next to us had to get a server's attention to ask for service, and I was about to go up to the hostess and ask when the owner finally noticed us looking over (probably looking a little annoyed) and told the hostess to go over. He ended up personally delivering our drinks and apologizing for the wait, which was nice, but it was still a little slow after that. Maybe they're just working out the kinks since it's a new place, but still.   All of that aside, we really did enjoy the food! We had the calamari, which was really well-seasoned and not too heavily breaded, and the red sauce it came with was amazing. I normally don't love red sauces with calamari, but I liked this one a lot. We also had the Pubblico Pizza which was really good. The crust was different (my boyfriend said it reminded him of matzoh dough), but in a good way! They also had a really good prosecco on the menu. We didn't get the happy hour price for everything like we should have, but otherwise the happy hour deals are really good! I also loved the decor and ambiance of the restaurant; it's very airy and open and pretty."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I saw this place opened a few days ago. It opened late February. We went back for the second time tonight. Everything was so good. I could eat here every day. It wasn't overpriced like most new places we've visited and the food was cooked to perfection.In our two visits we shared a sausage and mushroom pizza, the butternut squash gnocchi, the lasagna and the seafood linguini. Every single dish was perfect. My favorite was the gnocchi, it was full of flavor and perfect consistency. The seafood linguini was excellent, the seafood was cooked exactly right and the sauce was light and creamy, not too heavy. My boyfriends favorite was the lasagna, the meat in the lasagna was savory and sizzling. It was cooked in the wood fire oven at the end and gave it a smoky flavor. We couldn't ask for better service. The first time we went we met Edgar, he was funny and personable. The second time we met the owner Danny, who was behind the bar making drinks. He's super fun and interactive with the customers. Both times we went Jose was serving and did an amazing job, he always had a smile on his face and was very attentive. Cute place with a patio.It has everything we want!"}
{"text":"What a delightful find amongst all of the choices on 7th St.! The service was wonderful; we felt welcomed the moment we arrived. We had calamari and delicious marinara followed by a nice salad. My date had the homemade fettuccine topped with super fresh and perfectly cooked scallops and other seafood. I had lasagna--the best I've had in ages. All of that was enhanced by a great bottle of Ripasso. It's so refreshing to dine at a new place where everyone makes you feel like they're sincerely happy that you're there."}
{"text":"Clam linguini is sophisticated and tasty. Presidio cocktail is not too sweet and delicious with shaved nutmeg to add dimension. Pizza is delicious, excellent quality cheese, hearty sauce, gourmet crust. We were pleasantly surprised with something new and delicious."}
{"text":"We had a girls night / belated birthday celebration for Arlene I on a recent Wednesday night at Pubblico and it was a success!  Five girls, More than five glasses of wine.  Some calamari, a pizza, and five entrees... oh and excellent attentive service from Edgar, who happened to be celebrating a birthday the same night!  Pubblico has a fun, lively vibe with perfect lighting and acoustics -- or at least it seemed perfect for our party.  Comfortable and colorful, we would have stayed later but they closed down on us!  Note: the Pubblico website lists that they are open until 10, but they now close at 9 during the week.  They were cool about it though, not rushing us out.  The menu offers something for most... from pizza and pasta to entrees across the board and for those with dietary restrictions too.  I had the gluten free pesto pasta and added shrimp and it was good, but not so good that I had to finish my plate.  Drinks went down easy and had I not been driving, I would have had more than two.  The chicken parm was a hit as was the pizza... I think the cauliflower steak was okay as was the shrimp scampi.  I'd try some of the other specialties if/when I return.  Hope to do so soon!"}
{"text":"Decided to try something new this weekend. We found ourselves at this gem. It took over the location of Okra. Great Vibe, decor, and addition to the neighborhood.   We arrived around 8p and we greeted right away. Very friendly staff and our server was the best we've had in some time. He was spot on with descriptions for the wines. I'm happy he suggested the perfect glass.  The food was outstanding! I had the chicken fettuccine Alfredo. The pasta is homemade.  The girl had the chicken marsala. The mashed potatoes were so creamy and chicken delish!  Now, a good meal always ends with dessert . Both which were bomb.com . . . We def recommend the tiramisu"}
{"text":"This new to the area neighborhood gem is becoming one of my very favorites. You can't beat the seafood risotto or the chicken parmesan.  Do not miss out on their fantastic salads or brunch menu.  I think my very favorite menu item is the lobster ravioli. The place is hip yet welcoming and the staff is beyond friendly and accommodating. Danny the owner never stops smiling and makes sure everyone is having a great time. Have Edgar pour you a nice glass of cold rosé and enjoy lunch, dinner or brunch!"}
{"text":"We loved this place! Great food, fantastic service, and a nice indoor/outdoor seating area. We will definitely be coming back! Happy hour is a great deal too."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this restaurant. Had a group of 8 that planned to meet for dinner at 9:30pm on Saturday night. Website said dinner is served until 11pm. Called at 7pm and asked if a reservation was necessary, was told is would not be necessary and that the kitchen was open till 11pm. Our group showed up at 9:20pm. Everyone was excited to try this new establishment. Upon walking in we were told the kitchen is closed. The hostess then said \"things got quiet real quickly so we decided to shut down early\".  Really? On a Saturday night? Went to Mora and had a great meal and they were packed. This is a huge strategic error on the part of management team, especially for a new restaurant trying to make a good first impression. Very disappointing!  UPDATE - went back for an early dinner on Sunday to give Pubblico one more chance and it was amazing! We had the pepper and goat cheese bruschetta which was awesome. Romano Caesar salad was great. And the entree, spinach and ricotta ravioli, was excellent. Tiramisu for desert. Overall an excellent meal. Very nice ambiance and the service from our waiter was impeccable. Upgrading my rating from 1 star to 5 stars. This is definitely my favorite italian restaurant in Phoenix. Also very reasonably priced - dinner for 2 including mimosas and cocktails under $100! You definitely want to check this place out."}
{"text":"Definitely my new favorite Italian spot in Phoenix! Immediate and solid service from a professional and polite staff, the food and drink were perfect, an absolute must try!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a wine snob...nothing ruins a good glass of red wine more than it being served straight out of the refrigerator. My husband and I dined at Pubblico for our anniversary this past week. We got our wine during happy hour. $4 off glasses of wine? Yes please! The wine list was pretty diverse. The wine came out (Nebbiolo for me, Malbec for him) and I knew as soon as I picked up the glass that I would be disappointed. I could have floated ice cubes in it! The food was alright. I had butternut squash gnocchi and my husband ordered a seafood pasta dish which our server stated was not in a red sauce. When it came out, it was a vodka sauce so still of the red variety. Our server was nice but didn't seem overly knowledgeable about the drink menu or food recommendations. Overall, our experience was alright but with so many great restaurants in the area, I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Chicken Parm was solid. Antipasto board was very good ... just ask for extra bread! Chicken Pesto pizza was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Sat on the patio and there was a great ambience! We shared the calamari for an appetizer and had the Lasagna and Lobster ravioli for entree. The lasagna reminded me of a dish i had in Rome, the chunks of meat were so good. Enjoyed it all and want to come back to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants we've been to. My husband had the lobster ravioli, it came with a large perfectly seared scallop which I snuck a bite of. The scallop was one of the best I've ever had.  I had the seafood linguini which had mussels, jumbo shrimp, and scallops. Seafood cooked perfectly and the homemade pasta was also perfectly al dente. My daughter tried the pepperoni pizza which she loved!  Great happy hour, our favorite was the deep fried foccia bread stuffed with mozzarella cheese, breaded, then deep fried and came with delicious homemade marinara dipping sauce.  Service was very attentive and server was knowlegable but I can't remember her name. We will be back as their salmon and sea bass dishes looked incredible!"}
{"text":"Fantastic night! First time here and will be back! Our server Manny was so legit. The cocktails were consistent and tasty. The vibe great, beautiful patio, good music and the food oh mah gawd! Mozzarella cheese was bomb and a must get when you go, the shrimp so good. We loved everything!"}
{"text":"Pubblico is a fantastic local restaurant with class A staff and owners. The menu is short but has a variety of complex flavors and all sorts of dishes.  After asking the owner what his favorite dish was I was surprised to hear him suggest one of the seafood pasta dishes. I've grown up in coastal pacific towns my entire life and have been privy to some very good seafood. Who would have thought that a local restaurant in the middle of the desert could match that? Well, they did. From the scallops to the PEI mussels, everything was cooked just right and tasted like I had picked them up from the market myself.  I would recommend Pubblico to anyone that's in the Phoenix area if they want something that tastes homemade but is presented with top notch precision."}
{"text":"Was a little hard to find/enter but frankly that will not be a problem for them because this place is amazing (and they are getting new signage). I would visit before everyone finds out about it and it's packed daily. Why is it so great? Ambiance: huge bar and very open layout. Attitude: I was greeted enthusiastically by Danny the bartender, who was quick to give me the whole story on this charming new place. You can tell they really care about meeting new guests and building clientele. Happy hour: great prices and a variety of items included! Margarita pizza was so good I almost left without my credit card (or maybe it was the wine...?) I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"One of our friends had posted about this place.  We went for our anniversary.  It's a hidden gem, located behind a strip mall/thing if you call it that.  We tried the cioppino and lobster ravioli.  The meals were really good and you get generous portions of seafood.  We tried the chocolate torte which was a surprise for us.  They offered us complimentary dessert for our anniversary.  It was a great experience. We really enjoyed the restaurant and atmosphere.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Yes, this is our new favorite Italian place. There are a lot in the area, and this one seems the perfect speed. Very good food, reasonably priced for the fare, good service by local and down to earth staff. The kitchen is closed between 3-4, and we squeaked in just in time for some late lunch and cocktails. Very central Phoenix worthy with a great location and plenty of parking. We cant wait to come back for the weekend brunch from 10-3. Thanks for the great food and service."}
{"text":"Good happy hour prices, but the pizza was mediocre. Service was good and the space is pretty neat, but I probably wont be back."}
{"text":"Cannot give this place enough stars! We went there on a date night and everything was wonderful! The food is top notch (seriously, homemade pasta)! And everyone there was so kind and helpful! The outside seating is very spacious and attractive. We had a very nice date night! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"A combination of hospital food, airline and cafeteria food. The menu reads lovely. That's the only thing lovely about this place. Thankfully we ordered to go. Cheap ingredients, processed taste, soulless and lackluster. You would be better off throwing a frozen pizza in the oven. Dishes tried: arugula salad, butternut squash gnocchi and gluten free sausage, mushroom, truffle pizza. Do NOT waste your hard earned dollars here. An absolute joke!"}
{"text":"Came for restaurant week and it was a fantastic experience. The tomato & eggplant bruschetta was fantastic and I had the steak risotto and it was the best risotto I've ever had. It's small inside but the service and ambience are wonderful. Perfect spot for a date night and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Got to try all kinds of appetizers, pizzas, and cocktails. I loved the tomato and eggplant bruchetta, and the mozerella carrozza was out of this world- it was like a mozerella stick sandwich, yum!  For the pizzas I tried all kinds including the chicken pesto, the mushroom and sausage, the Pubblico, and the seafood pizzas. My fav had to be the seafood pizza- but to be honest their crust was not my favorite.   Cocktail wise, I highly recommend the spicy sweet Ardente Martini."}
{"text":"My aunt and I had an early dinner at Pubblico tonight. It was a wonderful experience. There were many items on the happy hour menu and happy hour prices were very reasonable with my Prosecco being only three dollars. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and very helpful with deciding what to have for dinner. Able was our waiter and was very attentive. I had the chicken piccata and my aunt had the beef risotto. Both were perfectly cooked and amazing. The restaurant got fairly busy which was great to see on Wednesday evening. This is truly a gem and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Such a lovely addition to the neighborhood and so glad we were able to try this place out this week! We were immediately greeted when we walked in and the service was nothing but a pleasant experience. The manager/owner stopped by during our meal to introduce himself and Pubblico which is just not something you see at your typical place but so much appreciated. The bruschetta, fettuccine and tiramisu were just delicious - you must try their noodles - and we will absolutely be back! Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner and a fun time last night at Pubblico. The entre's were great and fairly priced. I had the seafood risotto and was impressed with the quantity and quality of the seafood. We ate at the bar and were entertained by friendly bartender, Abel. I would recommend you try out this place"}
{"text":"Have lived in AZ all my life and have eaten at the best Italian food restaurants the valley has had to offer over the years ( Riazzi's at 53rd and McDowell, Tomaso's on Camelback in the 80's, Avanti ) and Pubblico appears to be the next best place. Ingredients, preparation, staff, wine selection and value top the many reasons to try Pubblico. Google will lead you to the storefront on 7th ST but the entrance and plenty of parking are behind the building!We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent! The food was great! We had the almond and pepper hummus bruschetta, fettuccine Alfredo, the lasagna, and the rum and fig bread pudding. Everything was delicious! We were personally greeted which made the experience even better. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. We had the Seafood Fettuccine and the Seafood Risotto. Seafood was fresh, perfectly prepared, and plentiful. The bruschetta appetizers were OK but not exceptional - we enjoyed the Salmon and Pesto, but the balsamic reduction on the Bresaola & Figs was too sweet for our taste. Outstanding Tiramisu. Service was friendly and attentive. We'll be back! Highly recommend - the food and overall experience are much better than Mora, just down the street."}
{"text":"There is something about handmade pasta that will always grab my attention. Loved the cocktails too! Happy to have Pubblico as our new neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"Wow this place is very good!!!!  Apps / Dinner / Desserts all excellent!!  Great service too."}
{"text":"There is something about handmade pasta that will always grab my attention. It's no secret that great food starts with fresh ingredients, but the best ingredients are amplified by being prepared fresh.  I dropped in looking for fresh pasta (oh the glory of handmade pasta) and found a chicken Parmesan that may be the best I have had in phoenix. I am looking forward to coming back HUNGRY so I can order some starters next time  The restaurant had a cool ambiance with great service. I will be back to take advantage of the patio.  (There is plenty of parking which is hard to come by in this area)"}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G !!!! Tried the Cauliflower and Polenta and it was by far the best Polenta I have had. Perfect texture and flavorFUL. The charcuterie board was a crowd pleaser as was the wine selection. They changed the space previously known as Okra to an open and inviting, energetic environment. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Only open about a week, but Danny Quinn, the owner, has the staff and kitchen humming. Great ambiance and warmth. Service was friendly, attentive, and helpful. Pastas are homemade, and taste that way. It's hard to get good seafood in Phoenix, but these folks have pulled it off. Portions of shrimp, scallops, clams and lobster are plentiful. Sauces are refined and subtle. And, prices are reasonable. (Make sure you head to the back of the building, btw.) We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed in the food.  The service and ambiance were amazing. Super cute restaurant. Our waitress was very good.  The food was just not that good.  The caprese bruschetta and mozzarella Carrazzo were good.  The marinara was just ok...not really spectacular.  Lacked flavor like garlic/basil.  The pizza dough wasn't good.  Had a funny taste to it.  The toppings were good and seemed fresh.  I ordered chicken parmigiana because it's my favorite food, but the crust was mush not crispy at all.  Again, it had an after taste that wasn't good.  They were awesome and allowed me to select something different so I ordered Chicken fettuccine.  The fettuccine was fresh, pasta was homemade.  I liked the flavor...had a touch of lemon to it. Chicken seemed a bit dry.  We also ordered the beef risotto which was excellent!!! Great flavors and cooked perfectly.  I can't say I'll be back unless there are improvements in the flavors of the food.  I just wasn't impressed with the food. The service was amazing and management was very good/concerned w customer satisfaction which is greatly appreciated.   I'm still searching for an amazing Italian restaurant in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch at Pubblico today. What an excellent place. The décor is very well done, everything is cool. The food was great as was the service.  Ill go again."}
{"text":"Excellent meal! I had the sea bass and the homemade pasta was wonderful! My boyfriend had the sausage and mushroom pizza which was very flavorful. The tomato and eggplant bruschetta was great-phenomenal bread! The one critique is that they could have had a better beer selection. Would definitely go back! Also loved the decor-industrial modern vibe."}
{"text":"This new Italian restaurant is now one of our favorite places to go because of the food, service and layout. The bar area is now bigger than the previous restaurant so we're please with the change. They have a good list of Italian seafood didhes. The portion is big and the price is reasonable. The shrimps are jumbo size and aren't dosed in butter so you can taste the shrimp. They have fried calamari but we like it grilled so they were able to accommodate. It's the best we ever had because it was cooked just right and you can smell and taste the charred garlic. Love it! The shrimp bisque is heavy but still good. Can wait to go back and try the seafood risotto and cioppino."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Pubblico in the Crown on 7th last nite, and it was impressive.  Went light with salads and pizza and both were perfect.  Salads, a raspberry and a ceasar, were well prepared, fresh, lightly dressed with shaved parmesan.  Chose a margarita pizza and added sausage and it was one of the best pizzas we've had in a town with an overload of good pizza.  A slightly thicker crust than most of the gourmet pizza offerings around town, which allowed the dough to remain somewhat firm and not flimsy once the veggies released moisture.  Sat at the bar and our server/bartender, Edgar was a pleasure.  Engaging, knowledgeable, attentive and part of the family in this family owned gem of a restaurant.  Positives...great food, great service and affordable.  Only negative...it can be noisy.  With doors/windows open in cooler months it's probably a non-issue, but the other half of the year, even sitting at the bar it was a strain to hear.  The dining area is just a large room with four-tops.  Could be improved with potted leafy trees to muffle sound and create more intimacy."}
{"text":"This place was EXCELLENT. Let me tell you why: Cute Scenery, Clean Bathrooms(nice looking too), fantastic food, and very exceptional service. Our waiter was amazing and the hostess is very laid back and helpful! I will definitely be coming back, especially for happy hour :). The food comes in smaller portions, but DO NOT let it fool you. It hit me like a wall when I finished the Lasagna, but this food is so comforting and tasty! Guys, please come by because you won't regret it, remember, parking is in the back :)!"}
{"text":"What a great little restaurant!! I'm a sucker for homemade pasta and my husband is always on the hunt for good wood-fired pizza. Needless to say, I was intrigued when I heard about Pubblico Italian Eatery. My husband and I had dinner here for our anniversary and everything from the food to the service was FANTASTIC! You can tell you're at a good restaurant when the server is passionate about what is being served. My husband ordered a glass of Cabernet and I ordered the El Pricidio* cocktail. The server warned me that the cocktail can be a little overwhelming because it is very floral, and he wasn't kidding! I enjoy sweet floral drinks so it wasn't a problem for me, but I couldn't have more than one of them. He suggested I try the first cocktail on the list with chili-infused tequila and strawberry purée (I forget the name). It was delicious but VERY spicy. Watch out! My husband had to help me finish it- he can handle more heat than I can. We shared the sausage and mushroom pizza as well as the lobster ravioli. Both were AMAZING. The ravioli was all lobster with a little bit of cheese, which you don't see very often! Normally restaurants skimp on the seafood but I was very pleased at the amount of lobster present in each bite! The pizza was yummy as well- the only thing I would critique about it was that the mushrooms were overpowered by the bell peppers and sausage. Next time we will probably omit the bell peppers and ask for extra mushrooms! We finished the meal with the tiramisu, which was delicious. Thank you Manny for such great service and making our anniversary that much more special! We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were very pleased with our experience. Good food, drink and service! The music was great and set a lovely mood for dinner. Best of luck to a great addition to 7th street."}
{"text":"If you love Italian you MUST try this restaurant. The atmosphere is beautiful, the waiters are friendly and the food is great. We had the Scampi for an appetizer... the flavor was delicious and the portion was generous. The beef risotto is hearty and beautifully presented. I look forward to going back and trying out their happy hour!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is family owned and operated and it shows! The menu has diverse selections including seafood pastas and pizzas. The mozzarella carrozza will have you wanting seconds and thirds. The margherita pizza was my favorite, but I tend to be very traditional about my pizza selections. I encourage you to try more exciting options like the sausage and wild mushroom or the chicken pesto! The patio is beautiful- perfect for a glass of wine and charcuterie. Thank you Danny for your hospitality!"}
{"text":"We decided to head over to celebrate the Mr.'s birthday (his pick). Honestly, I am not a big foodie person, but I enjoy going out to eat as a whole experience, so I was glad we went. The server was super nice and we picked an outdoor table, which was really nice because the weather was lovely and you could smell the wood as it burned in the kitchens wood-fired oven. We had the fried mozzarella appetizer which we all enjoyed. We ordered the chicken parm, chicken picatta, chicken alfredo and a pizza. The pizza was for our son, who is the worlds pickiest eater, and he liked it!!! What a small miracle. We all shared the food and enjoyed each dish. They were kind enough to let my husband pick a dessert of his choice on the house, so he went with the tiramisu, which was delicious and was pretty much demolished by our daughter. On top of a good dinner and nice ambiance, the owner, Danny, came out to visit and was friendly and genuine. For that reason alone, we will continue to visit this restaurant and support this local business. I hope you will try it too!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  A perfect addition to 7th Street!  Will be back soon for the Chicken Parm!"}
{"text":"So.... I'm still sad Okra is gone....but at least there is a fairly good replacement in town. Pubblico did a good job of redecorating the space (which is fabulous). I dropped in for HH..... Now, I was a little bummed that they don't have any specials on their specialty cocktails for HH, just well drinks, wine, and beer. This alone will reduce the amount of time I'll spend here. Regardless, they do have good food specials and the pizza and fried grilled cheese (yes, I said fried grilled cheese) we had were both tasty.    When we visited, there were a few kinks that needed to be worked out. First of all, when I asked how much a specific additional topping was for the pizza, our waitress said between 2-4$.. not 'I'm not sure, let me check'...that's a pretty big range when we're talking about a single topping. Additionally, there  was a bit of a pricing mix up (I ordered a well old fashioned, they brought their specialty old fashioned (supposedly....tasted like well to me) and I didn't know, drank it, and then was charged full price. They told me they wouldn't charge me for my pizza topping to adjust for the difference in the cost of the drink (not sure how that works...). Anyway, maybe it was just our waitress or because the restaurant was so new, but it seemed like they needed more time to get to know their menu. Also, it wouldn't hurt to price additional pizza toppings out like most places do. Regardless, I want to come back to try the pasta and will update when I do!"}
{"text":"Yes! Love it. The vibe and the menu is so unique but traditional. Love this new local spot.   Edgar was our bartender and I must say. He by far was my favorite person I've met on the 7th street restaurant row. He was really friendly and made us want to stay forever!"}
{"text":"We ordered three items: calamari, pizza, mozzarella carozza.  The calamari was the best of them.  The calamari was nicely fried and lightly breaded, and the sauce was tasty.  The pizza topping was flavorful, but the mozzarella does not seem to be fresh and if it is, it lacks flavor and texture of good fresh cheese.  The pizza crust is too fluffy and flavorless.  It reminded me of frozen pizza crust.  The mozzarella carozza is like a fried cheese sandwich.  The marinara served with it was tasty and you need lots of it to cover the sandwich since it lacks flavor.  The sandwich is nicely fried and not too oily, which is great, but again, the mozzarella they use is not flavorful and as a result the sandwich feels like a waste of calories.   The place has a nice atmosphere and I'll go back and try other items."}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed this little restaurant. The staff are great, the drinks are mixed well, and the food is made with care. The antipasto board surprised me with the large array provided. Bites of some things I've never had mixed with things I know and love really got me ready for the pizza and lobster ravioli. The pizza was good, not stellar, but the lobster ravioli was fantastic! The negronis are also spot on! Check it out if you have a chance."}
{"text":"We just stopped by Pubblico tonight for the first time.  First, they have an incredible happy hour.  Run don't walk.  Second, their wine selection contains a proper Super T and their pours are generous.  Third, and perhaps the most important piece, the food is incredible.  We had the shrimp scamp appetizer, Pubblico Pizza and lobster ravioli.  All items were fantastic and the staff and owner were attentive and engaging.    We will return again and again.  One would never know they just opened 3 weeks ago based on the quality."}
{"text":"I am very picky but their margherita pizza is one of the best I've ever had. Edgar made sure he took great care of my friend and I. The cocktails are great also. I will definitely be back here! Great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"A friend and I had the pleasure of eating at Pubblico last night, it was AMAZING. The owner, Danny, was super sweet, and down to earth. The atmosphere on the patio made it so we really didn't want to go home at the end of the night, and the food was the absolutely the best part. Thank you Danny & Pubblico, we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This was the absolute best lunch location that I have encountered in quite a long time! Thank you for offering a great lunch and great location although someone difficult to discover all in all it was a great meal!"}
{"text":"This is a cute place. The service was very good. We sat on the patio and was never left with empty water glasses or wanting to order with no one around.  Started with the calamari. It was excellent.  Crispy not too chew just perfect. Sauce was tasty. Then had the cheese sticks. Kinda like a deep fried cheese sandwich. Tasty. Lasagna was very good and gnocchi was excellent. The disappointment was the Chicken Parmesan.  It had all the right flavors but was well over cooked. The chicken was tough and the outside bordered on being burnt.  May try again. Maybe they need to get it together as they are new."}
{"text":"I really wanted this to be our go to Italian restaurant! The service was spot on and was very tentative to our party. There just wasn't any wow factor about the food unfortunately! I wish they had some homemade bread served with olive oil and balsamic, which is a basic when it comes to a true Italian restaurant. But we aren't going to cross this restaurant off our list bc the potential is huge there! Maybe will come back in a couple months."}
{"text":"Finally..... I found my Italian neighborhood joint. Service impeccable. Food outstanding. Tucked away off 7th street with a perfectly done interior, we were greeted as soon as we arrived by a smiling hostess. Seated promptly, our server had great energy with very good suggestions. Started with Focaccia, Shrimp Scampi , and Caprese Salad...Entrees were Lobster Ravioli and perfectly cooked Salmon...I see this place in our future forever. Grazie!"}
