{"text":"A nice surprise for a rest stop. Glad I decided to opt out of the Subway next door and try this place. Had a nice vegetarian sub made to my liking. The ingredients were saut√©ed, the cheese was melted and the bread was hot and crispy. Husband had the fish and chips and gave it the thumbs up.  Friendly service and clean bathrooms :)"}
{"text":"Went with my wife, a friend, and his daughter. I had the pepperoni calzone, it was excellent! Crust was just right, fillings delicious. My wife had the hot calzone, again perfection! Friend had chicken \"burger\", which was three huge slabs of breast meat, cheese and bacon- reportedly amazing. His daughter's cheese pizza was delicious. Saw some other patrons happily devouring smoked meat sandwiches which looked quite tasty as well.
Great little pub a bit out of the way in an unassuming building, but absolutely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Being relatively new to the area, I have been disappointed with the pizza here.  Heck, even in Montreal I have yet to find good pizza.  It seems the crusts in the area are either super thick or cracker-thin.  These folks have a crust that's 'just right' and a twist I have never seen before (I assume it's a nod to Montreal bagels): sesame seeds!  I'm very happy.  I just discovered my 'go to' pizza joint."}
{"text":"Fresh, quick, not expensive.  Don't expect from frozen or reheated food here, much of their offerings are made from scratch.  You don't have much choice for food around here.... Just off the highway, it's either Subway or this joint.  We were so pleasantly surprised with our choice... So much better than the alternative.  Friendly service and clean washrooms sealed the deal.  I had the quesadilla and wife had the chicken basket.  Both were delicious.  You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Really great little local bar restaurant.   Friendly staff and really good food.  A little noisy but not too bad."}
{"text":"He did not enjoy his chili, but I enjoyed my smoked meat sandwich, so we settled on three stars.  This was a quick stop on the way out of the traffic snarl that is Montreal. The atmosphere is upbeat and casual and the service is great.  The Cole slaw was house made and delicious.  No way I could finish my meal, but I tried. Their sodas are all canned, but that was ok.  Fifties and sixties playing, and I heard some stuff I hadn't heard in a long time."}
