{"text":"As someone who doesn't typically like indian food, this place was delicious. Got the chicken wrap and it was everything I wanted and more. Seasoned to perfection. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this gem when struggling to decide what to have for supper. Read some of the reviews and had to try it. The food did not disappointment. Very fresh and flavourful, just the right amount of heat, good portions and great price!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Service is fast casual: order and pay at the register then receive your food as it is cooked. The menu has plenty of options but I was intrigued by the wraps. It's a cool concept for a quick meal. Familiar like a burrito but with all of the delicious spices of Indian cuisine.  After talking with the owner at the register I settled on the seekh kabob wrap.  What I received exceeded all expectations. The meat (ground lamb) was spicy, flavorful and juicy. It came wrapped up in a tender, chewy piece of naan that was better than most of the naan I've received at restaurants before. The wrap also came with a good sized portion of masala fries which were crispy and well seasoned.  I also had a mango lassi which was excellent. And the best part... all of this only set me back about $14. I cannot recommend Wraps 'N Curry highly enough. I'll definitely be going back to try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"A nice little establishment with cuban decor. Even though no one looks Indian they sure make good Indian food for a reasonable price!  The hubby got the special vindaloo lamb and i got the dal special. Specials come with a soda and the worker was cool to change out the fountain drink for a salty lassi at no charge. Good Indian fast food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Looking forward to going back. Great variety of veggie and meat dishes. Had the Mamosa, chicken and fish wraps. Very tasty and filling. Very clean dining room and very friendly service. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Chicken Tikka Masala was pretty amazing - mainly the chicken, as you can taste the grill on the chicken.  The service was better than my first time there, but it's still far from good.  All in all, the MO hasn't changed much since my first visit.  The food is absolutely on point, but the service and ambiance are pretty lackluster."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've ever had. Maybe even best food I've ever had. I got the chicken curry and the meat is very tender. Also got some samosas and garlic naan. All of it is super good!"}
{"text":"I love this place. First time here and got the paneer tikka masala that was for lunch special. Comes with rice, naan, and drink. Very delicious and well priced. Will recommend."}
{"text":"This is why I love yelp! It introduces me to lovely new places like this one. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to the Masala fries (big enough to split with 2 people. The Malai Kofta (veggie dumplings) was delightful and had a complex flavor. My friend ordered and thoroughly enjoyed the chicken tikka masala. We'll be revisiting again soon. I love that there's an entire section for Veggie entrees - look forward to trying the veggie wrap! The prices are reasonable, the service is quick, the restaurant is clean, and the naan is lovely. If you're looking for quick Indian food in a casual environment then I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is definitely a great place for Indian food in the west valley. Food is freshly made and delicious. I ordered a to go for lunch through Yelp and when I got there, it was waiting for me. It was a little difficult to find, as it is behind another building. However,  you will be pleased when you find it. I will definitely return for more Indian food."}
{"text":"Great tasting food without the high end restaurant price. From the outside it looks like a small place, but they are able to accommodate groups and / or families. The food comes out fast and the portions are a good size. They also have a good selection of food to choose from. If your in the area and are in the mood for good Indian food, I highly recommend Wraps N Curry."}
{"text":"This is my new go to place for cheap, fast Indian food.  The curry portions are big and come with rice or naan. We chose rice and then ordered a side of garlic naan. The dishes are definitely shareable so bring a friend or two and try different things. The wraps are huge and come with tasty \"masala fries.\" We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff!!! We've eaten from here a few times since they opened and we've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"You can't beat this place for the price! I always order chicken Tika Masala and everywhere in the north valley they have for at least 12.99. This place has it for a little under $9 and it is absolutely delicious the size is pretty good too. We also had the red curry and it was very tasty. I did order it to go so I didn't eat there so my naan was a bit moist but still warm and tasty."}
{"text":"Love the Tiki Masala Chicken wrap here! The garlic naan is also very tasty. My wife likes the Desi Chicken wrap every time we order."}
{"text":"I got the desi chicken wrap. I really liked it. The chicken had a good spice to it. It came with a spicy mint sauce that gave a really good flavor to it which I loved. I had to drown my wrap in it! The fries it came with were okay. They were soft and I usually like my fries to be crispy. And I wish it came with more of the seasoning. But overall I would recommend the wrap. I wanna try the tikka masala wrap next!!"}
{"text":"This is a little place we stumbled upon. The chicken tandoori is amazing. The naan is the best around and desert to die for. The amount of food for the price is outstanding"}
{"text":"Exceptional food!  The Curry's were so flavorful with the right amount of spice, and the Naan was fantastic. For the price, this food is an easy go to!"}
{"text":"It's actually kind of crazy how good this place is...we ordered the chicken curry, paneer tika masala, chicken wrap, veggie wrap, and some garlic naan bread. It was all seriously SO DELICIOUS! We will definitely make this a regular spot! It even makes delicious left overs!"}
{"text":"Curry was good not great. Coke tasted very strange almost like there was dirt in the drink. For fast food it was ok not as good as the Persian room or tandoori times."}
{"text":"Quick and amazing food! I've been trying a lot of different restaurants offering curry and this is by far my favorite. Customer service is kind and humble.  Prices are perfect. Most items I've ordered are big enough to split. Yum!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a whim. I ordered the samosas and chicken curry. The lunch special was a great deal. It came with a salad, naan, rice, and drink. The flavor of the samosas was very delicious. I enjoyed the curry but will order it spicy the next time. Service was prompt and polite. I will certainly come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Found this new little restaurant  that has wraps n curry i had the Desi chicken wrap it was awesome I asked for extra  sauce because it was so good. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"A well executed restaurant with splendid authentic Indian cuisine and top rated table service. The Chicken Biryani is delicious and well-portioned, and the Chicken curry dishes are best eaten when paired with their yummy in house nan. a great value overall. Give them a try, you'll be happy you did.  Desserts are all made in-house and very good too"}
{"text":"If you enjoy Indian food, try this place. It's only been open a month. But the food is wonderful. Had the chicken and paneer tikka masalas and the sag paneer. Highly recommend. Plates come with rice or naan. Had rice with mine with a side of plain naan.  My better half had garlic naan that she declared is the best she has had. And we have eaten at quite a few Indian restaurants. Prices are very reasonable for a substantial portion. Service was good even though staff was being trained. Small place with a few tables. We ate in but it would be a great place to stop to grab and go. We will be back."}
{"text":"Really awesome food. Great quality. Great quantity. Great value. Absolutely loved the flavor. Everything was cooked right. We had the Chicken Curry, the Baingan Bharta and the Paneer Tikka. Definitely will order again! Got the delivery and paid through GrubHub. They were a little slower on the delivery than expected. Otherwise no complaints out of me. Awesome job. Great to have another option out there for some fantastic curry."}
{"text":"I am so impressed. We will definitely be back and the amount of GrubHub and UberEats orders going out of here, it's definitely an favorite. I know what our Friday night order out food is now! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Wraps 'N' Curry is a small Indian Fast Food Restaurant located in an older strip mall in North Phoenix. It's in the spot where Mi Comida was on Bell Rd. This restaurant is hard to see from the road because Taco Bell is in front of them. This is a casual restaurant. You order at the counter and seat yourself.   We started with the Aloo Tikki. We got two Indian Spiced Potato patties and a bowl of Indian seasoned garbanzo beans. Both were good. The potato patties were very tasty and seemed free of grease. The garbanzo beans were tender and also tasty. Both were fresh made. It was bigger and better than what I was expecting for only $4.95  I also tried the Desi Chicken Wrap. The wrap was made with a naan bread wrapper that was almost like a big tortilla. It was lightly brushed with mint mayo. Inside was a crunchy fresh salad and Tandoori chicken. Everything was tasty and fresh! I didn't taste the green chilies it was suppose to have so either they didn't use much or that ingredient might have been forgotten but I was still happy because it was tasty. They also gave us masala fries that were fluffy with crisp exteriors that were lightly dusted with something that taste like garam masala. This was a GREAT VALUE at only $7.95  Me and my husband were more impressed with the Crunchy Fish Wrap. I thought it was just going to be a frozen fish stick but no .......it was real hand battered mild tasting fish. It was very tasty!  It not a fancy place but they serve GREAT VALUE FRESH FOOD that only cost a little more than your fast food joints."}
{"text":"Wow, this was amazing! My biggest beef with Indian food is that it usually cost a lot to taste awesome... BUT this place is priced affordable for AMAZING flavors! We shared a chicken tikka masala and lamb curry. The portions were so big we couldn't finish them!  Then we got a ras malai dessert to share... if you like Tres leches, you will love their ras malai."}
{"text":"So if you every wondered what amazing Indian food taste like, well this is the place! The favors are fabulous and the service is impeccable."}
{"text":"Ok I was going to keep these one to   myself.    But it's to dam good to not share it. Small place already love it right love Ma And Pa places.  The people that work there are very friendly . But the food is so dam good I was in heaven .If you don't try it you just passed up a true foodie experience. I will be back and tell my friends about it ."}
{"text":"Delicious food with plenty of veggie options in a casual, friendly atmosphere. Definitely a favorite."}
{"text":"The naan bread is so fresh and delicious. My favorite wrap is the veggie wrap! That mango drink is really good too."}
{"text":"I saw the good reviews and decided to try it for take-out because I was near ASU West, and I love Indian food.  This place is awesome and reasonably priced.  It's a very small hole-in-the-wall place, but is clean and cheerful.  (I think there used to be a Guatamalan restaurant here?)  The samosas were perfect.  A little bit of spice, but not fire-engine hot, and not dripping in grease like the ones you get at some other restaurants.  The chicken tikka masala was packed in a pint-sized plastic tub and comes with your choice of rice or naan.  The naan was home-made and perfectly soft and flavorful.  They also included another container with garbanzo beans in a spicy sauce.  Everything was fresh and yummy!  We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok...  waiting to try this for EVER.... ordered the spicy chicken wrap. This was awesome!! This is way different than just going out. New flavors and spices! I'm a fan! Will be back, got to try this place or your missing out on a little gem.  Even writing this I want more!"}
{"text":"We had the chicken curry, chicken masala, and fries. The curry, fries, and naan are all really good. Personally I wasn't a fan of the masala. I would give it 5*, but my coke had a dirt after taste and my husbands Dr Pepper was off too. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I've been here about four times now, and the food is superb, especially for the price! I recommend the dailyt special. It gives you a chance to sample new things and there is so much food!"}
{"text":"Soooooooooo good - and the cashier was exceptionally helpful and friendly. Highly recommend!!! I have a gluten allergy, and she was very accommodating :) Yelp does not have their full menu, but I believe google does. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala Wrap, which was basically Chicken Tikka Masala wrapped in Naan. It was delicious! It came with a side of Crinkle Fries with an Indian spice mix sprinkled over top and a mint chutney dip. The price was amazing for the flavor and amount of food. I definitely will be back :)."}
{"text":"We have found our go to place for very yummy Indian food. We each ordered something different and everything was good. Each dish comes with a side of basmati rice or nan. Since it is very casual and a small place, they are able to keep prices low. We have tried a couple of the Indian food resturanrs in town and this place is better."}
{"text":"I tried samosa and aloo tikki with chickpea curry, all tasted so good. I loved the veg biryani and raiyta. My husband loved his chicken biryani. All cooked well, served well and tasted deliciously good. Warm hospitality ,quick service and tasty food really makes it a amazing place. Will love to come here again."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Phoenix. I think its a relatively new place compared to other Indian restaurants around.  We ordered Garlic Nan, Malai Kofta and Paneer Tikka Masala. The food was delicious and the spice level was adequate. They also have some pretty interesting wraps and kathi rolls. I'm definitely gonna try them next time.  Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"A new place to try! The reviews were 5 stars and I LOVE Indian food, so I was really excited to try it out!   Unfortunately I was disappointed. The Paneer Tikki Masala Wrap was not great. The sauce really had no flavor. Luckily for me, we split that and the Veggie Wrap. The Veggie Wrap was better, but still not great.   For being \"fast food\" the quality is good, but the \"fast\" part is lacking. I really wish there were flavors- since Indian Food is normally very flavorful which is the point of indulging!   On the plus side, the waitress was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Very good Indian food  Great price and very good customer service.. I will definitely be coming soon..."}
{"text":"I love Indian Food but I'm not into buffets.  This little gem has amazing food, the price is right and there is no buffet.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a chicken tikka masala wrap and a mango lassi - both excellent.  Friends had paneer tikka masala, onion naan, and a tandoori chicken wrap - they loved theirs also. The portions are huge, def big enough to share, and the ladies that run the place are very friendly.  Small, casual and unassuming little place.  Great little gem in the neighborhood.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place. My family and I felt very welcomed, and the food was perfect. Very reasonably priced for the quality. We will continue to come here."}
{"text":"We found this place thanks to Yelp! I had the Desi Chicken wrap and it was absolutely delicious. And the portion size was huge, I saved half for lunch the next day! My husband tried the curry and wasn't a big fan (said the consistency was similar to pedigree) but I thought it was fine. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hole in the wall location.  Located near Taco Bell but don't let that discourage you they have great food great menu great prices.  The waiter/cashier was incredible she has a wonderful hospitable personality in serving."}
{"text":"Wow, my first time here and I'm in love!!! The food is so amazing and extremely reasonably priced. They've only been open for a month but these people know what they're doing.  I had the veggie wrap, the flavor combination was so great. The portion was huge I had to take half of it home.  My husband had the malai kofta and it too was delicious.   The chef cane out and chatted a bit. You could really tell he was passionate about the food snd took pride in it. I don't know what magic he has but he's cast a spell on my tastebuds!!  Try this place out I guarantee you will be a customer for life."}
{"text":"Tried the saag paneer and it was cooked to perfection. The rice wasnt the freshest but i probably came right before closing. Ill come back soon!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly very good food. Lamb kebabs were awesome. Loved it. Will definitely visit again and this time for their wrap."}
{"text":"I had the tikka masala wrap and the portion is huge for $8.99! The flavors was out of this world. The fries could be cooked a little more but the wrap made up for it. I would definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Food was great. Price is great. Food was tasty, freshly prepared, and off the grill. I highly recommend this place. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Wow. First off, on the whim of an Indian food craving, we came across this little place on yelp. Now, we don't live close but we're willing to make the trip on account the reviews were great and the pictures were great. We unfortunately were so hungry when we got home, we neglected to capture the beautiful vivid colors and the food when fresh (as fresh as it could be after a 15 min ride home with takeout). I will add, it was still hot and well packaged so there was no drawback to getting it to-go which is hard to find.  Now for the food. We decided to take the risk and order about $50 in food to see a good variety of tastes and options in the event it turned out good. It did. It turned out great and just earned its place in the food ordering lineup. The chicken tikka masala, basmati rice, seekh kabobs, Channa masala, samosas, garlic naan, Kheer and tandoori roti were all stellar. The food was of fresh, rich, clean quality with warm and proper seasonings that seemed brighter than most Indian food out here. It was refreshing, filling, flavorful, a good amount of spice but not overwhelming, and well prepared.   In closing, this was a hidden gem that I hope you do yourself the favor and try. Nothing will let you down that we ordered and I'd imagine the other items would be just as amazing. This is well worth the drive from far west Peoria in summer heat so don't be afraid to venture out. You will love it."}
{"text":"Found this new spot by just searching for Indian food in my area. Super \"hole in the wall\" but amazing. I got the samosa (bomb) the aloo tikki (super bomb) and the Chicken Tikka Masala wrap (bomb.com) I highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I came to this little whole in a wall and tried there chicken curry and amediatly fell in love with this dish the naan bread is so soft and buttery my mouth watered just thinking about it, and there mango lassi drink is out of this world."}
{"text":"We had three different wraps, all delicious!  My favorite was the veggie wrap - well seasoned.  My daughter had the chicken wrap & thought it was a little spicy,  but she's a big wimp. My husband and I thought it was fine.  Service was fantastic. 4 stars because while it's not the best food I've ever consumed,  it hit the spot."}
{"text":"The wife and I were about to spend significantly more money for smaller servings at a place near to this place. Luckily we gave this place a chance and we were very pleasantly surprised! The place is nothing to look at, but the food is amazing, portions healthy, and prices incredibly reasonable. We will come here again for sure! Great, friendly service too!  They deliver through Postmates too!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Great find and a good replacement to the prior restaurant. Delicious food. Great qty. Amazing garlic naan and good service. The prices were unbeatable too. Mark down another great place for Indian food in this area!"}
{"text":"Fantastic flavors, affordable, fast service!! Do yourself a favor and make it a point to go here. Had the chicken tikka masala wrap--sooooo amazing. Highly recommended. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I wish I could leave a rating higher than 5 Star.  What an amazing flavorful and fresh eating experience.    I cannot recommend this place highly enough.  Love it.  My new favorite spot"}
