{"text":"The food here is actually quite good. My husband stopped by to get a brisket sandwich and brought me home bagels and green onion/bacon cream cheese. Both were excellent. However their service hours have been spotty (that's putting it nicely), they struggle to stick to their posted hours which is a nuisance."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time and was pleased with the selection.  I had the philly cheese steak sandwich and my daughter had a hot dawg.  Both were good and the onion strings were incredible.  We will definitely be coming back to try other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Ignore the negative reviews

This place has incredible bagels and sandwiches, which Scarborough has NEVER had.

I've tried sandwiches at many of the big delis: Carnegie's (RIP), Canter's, Caplansky's, Wolfie's, Centre Street, Kenny and Ziggy's and these sandwiches hold up to or exceed any of these.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We've been waiting for a good bagel/deli joint to open up in this area for a long time and this is the place! This is the real deal. The bagels are soft, light, and tasty. Extremely polite and helpful staff.  Even the prices are on point. My hubby and I will be regulars here for sure. Really looking forward to exploring the menu."}
{"text":"They're not open yet and their store front seems to be complete.

They keep putting up signs saying they're open then taking them down. They've also boarded up the windows with cardboard.

Suspicious."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place for months now.  They have had some issues getting started -- odd hours and unplanned issues.  And yes, they're still learning so the service is a bit scattered.  I expect this will get better.

Today I finally managed to get in there and try the Montreal smoked meat.  It was delicious.  I've tried Kaplansky's and this is better.  Note: that is the extent of my smoked meat knowledge.  The pickled sides were good too.

I'll definitely be back.  The menu is much more extensive than I had expected.  I'm looking forward to trying their bagels next."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to checking out this new restaurant. Ordered 4 burgers and 2 poutines. When the food arrived, the poutines were missing. The staff began arguing that it was not ordered and why I was even overcharged for what I got. Left feeling very frustrated. 
And the burgers were not good at all. Sorry."}
{"text":"Who runs out of food on their first day and closes for the weekend to figure it out? Not cool. Been waiting for a while to get this place I'll review again once they figure it out."}
{"text":"I knew it.  As sad as I am at not having had a chance to try out their food, MINKY'S IS OFFICIALLY OUT OF BUSINESS.  I was just in the plaza picking up a few things and notice the sign is down and the store has been emptied out.  What do you expect from a business that can't keep regular hour..."}
{"text":"My husband just brought home Smoked Meat sandwiches from Minky's.  They are absolutely delicious!  They were generous in size, lean meat etc.  We do eat smoked meat on a regular basis and are quite picky. We will definitely be back!  Service was also quick and the staff were pleasant."}
