{"text":"If you are a croissant-aholic --- look no further!  I wish I could give this place 10 stars! Really, truly a scrumptious experience. To give a bit of background, I had been trying all the recommended patisseries in search of the perfect flaky croissant but had been generally disappointed. On the second to last day of my vacation, waiting for a store to open, I stepped into this little gem of a cafe and spotted what appeared to be fresh pastry, at the same time my companions complained of being hungry. We looked at the menu on the wall and decided to order the breakfast of  3 eggs with tomatoes, tea/coffee, croissant or toast, potatoes and sausage or bacon for $8.99.   We weren't expecting too much, but we were in for a surprise. The eggs came back perfectly cooked the tomatoes seasoned beautifully, gorgeous thick-cut bacon, and the potatoes a golden-crispy delight... but the best part was the gorgeous croissant. Flaky, tender and freshly baked in-house, it almost floated off the plate straight into my mouth. I don't know if the strawberry jam that was served on the side was homemade as well, but it tasted divine.  Needless to say, the next day we returned, had the same breakfast and were in time to see the pastries being brought up from the basement kitchen. We promptly bought 3 of each pastry;  chocolate croissants, regular croissants, raisin buns, and indescribably delicious cinnamon confections -- really each more delicious than the next.  I'm marking this little gem as a must eat next time we're in Toronto! YUMM!"}
{"text":"When I first moved into the area, I was thrilled to note that a French bakery that bills itself as \"home of the gateau basque\" was around the corner. I got the gateau basque as a take-out and it was pretty good. I once had a coffee and a croissant on the premises, though, and I was disappointed. The coffee was from a drip machine, which is hardly French, and the croissant had the texture of a dinner roll. To make matters worse, there was a fly buzzing around me, and the premises smelled of chlorine."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much either from the lackluster decor probably because it's takeout clientele. Totally taken back by the curry chicken salad + avocado/bean salad for $6! Very filling and left such a great impression on me; if I ever stop at Rosedale station, I will visit again. Great service. From what I was told, their menu changes everyday. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Came in on a rainy day before my doctor's visit. Wanted to get some treats for the good 'ol doc and the nurse cuz they take good care of me =D Their box contained: gateau basque apple tart almond clusters macaroons  Of course I had to get one of each tart, cuz I take care of me too ;) Gateau Basque was delicious! So was the apple tart.  Space was a bit dim and deserted since it was around 4pm on a Wednesday. Great service from the lady at the counter tho!  She made sure my box and the one I was giving away had 2 separate plastic bags since it was raining. How thoughtful!  3.5 stars cuz I have yet to try their meals, but I'll round it up higher - the Gateau Basque alone is worth a return trip."}
{"text":"This was an impromptu visit to this place and based solely on the croissant I tried here. A pathetic attempt at a croissant I would even go as far as saying some mainstream supermarkets offer a better version. The setup is OK. The other baked items looked OK but if they are to by the standard of the croissant I tied I would stay away,"}
{"text":"Well, I just tried their afternoon coffee and pastry deal.  I see why it's offered as a deal.  The croissants & danish on offer, weren't just a few hours old, they had some pretty big issues.  The danish I selected, which was the best looking one was rather overcooked...the raisins had dried to little charred rocks, the sugar on the bottom was hard enough to chip a tooth on, and the bread was dry. The coffee had also clearly been brewed some time ago.  As a place to hang out, I have to say nothing made me want to stay here.  The tables weren't terribly comfortable, the lighting (both artificial and natural light) was not good, and I just didn't feel comfortable.    When I fill out the \"ambience\" box for the review there's a choice of \"upscale\"--in this case I would like to choose \"downscale\".  Maybe some of their other take-out is better?"}
{"text":"Unassuming French bakery with mouth watering gateau Basque and assorted other pastries, including a croissant-type roll with dense hazelnut paste.  Not easy to find as it doesn't even have a sign out front but check it out."}
{"text":"I ran into this place due to the fact it started raining and I was walking around the area. Service was friendly, the food behind the counter looked hit or miss. I ordered a piece of quiche, got to the counter only to notice the cash only sign, and then they told me I couldn't pay yet because mine was a premium quiche and they didn't know the price of it. Thankfully I ate the quiche and the price ended up being reasonable."}
{"text":"I come here often to pick up croissants and other pastries which are always freshly made. Nice fresh baked smell when you walk past. They have delicious quiche and a great tart tatin. It's not a fancy place like those up Yonge street near the liquor store but the food is great. Usually has some nice art work on the walls too and there's a little patio in the back."}
