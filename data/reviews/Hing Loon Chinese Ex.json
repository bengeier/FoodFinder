{"text":"First of all you can't get anybody who speaks or understands english at a 3rd grade level.  I knew right from the the first words out the mans mouth my order would get messed up.  When the food came it was wrong.  I called and this time it was a lady who didn't speak or understand english well.  So when i said they messed up my order she was confused and then became rude and hung up the phone on me.  Horrible  all around experience."}
{"text":"food is bad  don't go  save your money    you should just eat your 5 dollar bill it would tast better"}
{"text":"went there to try their lunch ordered' they ask if we would like something to drink i said,just a glass of water please,they said we do not have any water just bottled water who knows about the food,but to lose a customer over a glass of water, but by the other reviews i don't think i am the one who lost out"}
{"text":"Hing Loon is a family owned restaurant, and it shows. It's a decent little place for some chinese food. Although it may take more than once to find your favorite plate, it's ok for chinese food. Out of the five times I've been there, once I had my rice burned. I told them about it, and they made some more. It can be kinda pricey, at around $7-9 a meal, it's worth a try if you're in the Glendale Area."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here Saturday night at 8:00 PM after checking out the flyer left near our door.  We drove the mile and a half there and were pleasantly surprised to see people leaving with cartons of food and smiles. Upon entering the hole-in-the-wall joint we were immediately greeted by a the young lady at the counter.   We ordered what we usually get when we go to a Chinese restaurant. Wife got the Kung Pao Chicken and I the Orange Chicken.  we both opted for the dollar upgrade on the entree' and had fried rice instead of the steamed rice. After a short wait and while watching the flat panel TV, our food arrived hot and fresh. The Kung Pao was exceptional, the Orange Chicken was just as good.  the Fried rice was served hot and plentiful as well. The foods were pleasing to the eye as well as the palate. We ate to our fill and were left with enough to bring home and have the following day.  We are very satisfied and happy to have found this gem in the rough on Glendale ave. Will we return?  Most definitely.  our search for the chinese takeout we've craved since moving here 10 years ago has finally been sated."}
{"text":"Such a gem hidden in a rather \"ghetto\" part of town!! I have eaten here 3 times and have been impressed each time. Had the lunch special Beef and Broccoli it comes with rice, egg roll, and a Rangoon all for $5.95! Can sodas are only 75cents. Family owned business which is definitely where I like to spend my money! Absolutely love going here on my lunch breaks, dining room is small but cozy, owners are very friendly. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Never heard of this place before, but we stopped by today.  We ordered the seafood combination, Mongolian beef, and lo mein.  Everything was delicious and the portions were so plentiful that we could not finish the food.  We will definitely swing by again if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Inexpensive and quick service.  The orange chicken was good.  The lunch special was pretty basic.  For the price it was fine."}
{"text":"My go to Chinese place. Very good combination fried rice and pepper steak. If you're thinking about ordering...Go for it!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Tried to order delivery, first guy says they wont deliver because Bethany Home and 59th ave is too far, if 5-10 mins is too far im not sure where they will deliver to. Called again and asked how far they are willing to deliver, she said 5-45 mins. Im pretty sure they have no idea where Bethany home is and just lost a 50$ order because of it. Lady ended up putting the phone down and leaving me on hold while she took other orders. I'll never order from here. Bunch of idiots."}
{"text":"1. Best bbq pork around. Its tasty, juicy and tender and the sauce they put on it takes it one step above.  2. Great customer service. They are always friendly.  3. Many fresh menu items.  4. They tend to be quick  This is definitely one of my favorite chinese places to fet takeout(nevee ate in the restaurant). Their lunch specials are priced fairly and give you a good amount of food. Give this place a tey you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time tonight. Food was excellent and great portions. We got beef and broccoli and they added water chestnuts for me. We also got shrimp lo mein. There was so much shrimp! You don't get that very often. The gentleman on the phone was very nice as well as the delivery man. We just found a new go-to Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Thought that since we lived close, food delivery would be a good idea. WRONG. Ordered the family dinner A.  Asked to substitute almond chicken for sweet and sour pork for an extra charge.  Received the food, unpacked it.  Much to my surprise, it was awful! The fried rice was cold,  the egg drop soup tasteless, and almond chicken as delivered was actually moo goo gai pan with a few almonds! Who ever heard of that!  When I called to complain,  the owner didn't care. Last time for this place. Skip it and go down the road."}
{"text":"Food is good always hot and ready to go when we get there to pick it up. Hot n sour soup is best i have tasted. I always pick up... but the restaurant area is alway clean and has people in it.  Food is good.. give it a try."}
{"text":"Been coming here for quite some time for take out have always had a good experience. Great pricing along with fast service. Never once have I ordered something that I did not enjoy. This will continue to be my neighborhood spot for Chinese take out."}
{"text":"HING LOON. TAKE 2. I threw caution to the wind and went against my norm to order only soup and eggrolls only before trying entrees.  1st was the combination fried rice (a.k.a. house fried rice). It was very tasty and not overly salty....yay!!! Remember kids you can add salt, but you can't take it out ;-) That's why God made soy sauce packets. My 1st bite transported me back to an old favorite spot back East that my family frequented when I was a kid......ahhhhh memories :)  2nd on the docket was chicken with broccoli (+ onion and carrot) and it too was delish and 'so fresh and so clean, clean' ^-^.  Riddle me this why no duck sauce? I wonder what you put on your eggroll? Hmmmm.....must investigate that next.  Overall, compared to another local establishment up the street, I am highly impressed and think you should be too. I give Hing Loon a high 5 today!"}
{"text":"We actually really enjoy the food but like every typical Chinese food place they are cheap with continents I ordered 4 takeout meals and they gave me 2 chili containers I asked for extra and she wanted to charge me I honestly spend a good amount of money here and can't believe she wanted to charge me for extra chili we will never go back again cause the customer service sucks"}
{"text":"Hung a Loon is what is should be called!   I tried this place when I bought my house I was moving, tired, and hungry an interesting little man came to the door. He was carring with him a menu to the Hing Loon. It had pretty pictures of the fabulous feast that would await. I asked about the food and was assured it was delicious.   So I proceeded to call and speak to a woman who did not understand English very well (not uncommon for a mom and pop Chinese joint). After repeating my order several times and feeling confident that she had it down.  I sat back and waited for Beef chop suey, Teriyaki chicken, an egg roll and free crab puffs the special on the menu to be delivered. 45 minutes later it arrived and smelled great. I figured since I live 1/2 a mile from this place that 45 minutes could mean they are very busy or just very slow. After tasting the food I believe it was the latter of the two.   1st both dishes were swimming in sauce almost like soup. The chop suey touted brown oyster sauce it was white and it frightened me a little. I took the first bite and could not allow my stomach to be subjected to this kind of crime. I promptly spit it into my napkin.   The teriyaki chicken was very fatty and had a funny taste it was rubbery like that of an old bird. Egg roll I think not grease stick! My favorite was crab puffs! You bite in and get a puff of air not the creamy cheese and Crab as intended for a crab puff to be.   Don't do it! For the love of god and all that is holy I beg you! Do not punish your taste buds with this garbage served in cute Togo containers!"}
{"text":"This place's egg rolls are off the chain! Super tasty chicken Lo mein as well. Really big lunch portions for a very reasonable price ($5.50)."}
{"text":"Okay please don't believe the 1, 2, & 3 star reviews so far. I am sick and tired of people complaining about an establishment, give them 1-3 stars because of the condiment amount or lack thereof, then tell you how wonderful the food is. If the food is great then the review should be at least a 4 because of the stupid amount condiments.   So here goes my review. This place was refreshing, delicious and an absolute pleasure.  Tips:  Condiments: yes they don't provide enough soy sauce. But really you'll know why, simply because you won't need any. Take this from a guy that needs extra soy sauce from Panda Express.   Delivery: Fast efficient and friendly. They said 35-45, but came under 30.   I have to say I really can give this place 5 stars for everything. I highly recommend this to anyone that is nearby for delivery or take out. Well worth the money."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery with Postmates and am very happy  This is not the place to go if you are looking for high quality authentic Chinese food.  But if you are look for good, cheap, Chinese-American food, this is the place!  Big portions for the price, tastes great, and arrived hot!"}
{"text":"I love this place! When you have had a long day and just want food brought to you this place is the best! The moo shu is amazing with whichever meat you choose my favorite is the chicken. They also have a yummy sweet and sour sauce, not that generic metal tasting gross stuff that some people use. The delivery guy know me now because I order from here so often, and he is great too! He always puts up with my crazy little barking dogs and is so sweet and very polite. This place is worth the try!!"}
{"text":"The portions are huge and proce was very affordable. They delivered to a large luncheon ay my customer's location. They were on time and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"This is possibly the worst chinese food I've ever eaten - of course, that's just my opinion and those who ate lunch from there with me."}
{"text":"It's pretty good honestly,I love the lo mein shrimp.the shrimp wasn't over cooked (thank god) and they give you a side of rice for free!!:D freaking awesome.they are nice and friendly. Orange chicken was sweet and I found a slice of orange in it so,I'm guessing its cooked with amazing ingredients. I'm definitely coming back.me and my kids loved it."}
{"text":"It's one of my go to spots if my favorites are closed been coming here for well over a year. Good portions for the price me and my partner usually buy one plate and share cuz it's sooo much food."}
