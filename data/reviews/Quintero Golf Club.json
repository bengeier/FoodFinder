{"text":"Wow, was I put off by the negative service at this place!  While the course conditions are very nice, they honestly have no idea how to treat their customers or run a golf course.  

I booked a tee time for myself and my father (a 2-some) weeks in advance.  When the two of us showed up at the course, they started asking us where our other two people were??  Excuse me - we booked a tee-time as a 2-some, not as a 4-some.  Rather than admit their mistake, we were forced to call in almost every member of management to sort out the issue because they wanted to charge us for 4 tee times!  After almost 20 minutes of arguing, they finally relented and we were able to get out on the course.

When we finally got on the course, play was pretty much the slowest I have ever seen.  On one particular Par 3 hole, there was a backup of 5 groups with 2 carts each - for a total of 10 carts waiting on ONE hole!  It took us almost an hour to play the hole as a result.  The only time we ever saw a ranger, it was a guy handing out brownies.  Brownies?  Really?  Instead of baking, they should be controlling the pace of play better.  

In the end, we couldn't even finish 18 holes (it got too dark around Hole 15) and we had to return to the clubhouse.  The pro shop was closed when we returned, so there was no one to even discuss the situation with further.  If I am going to pay OVER $200 to play a course, it better be a wonderful experience and this sadly was not.

Sorry, Quintero... you really need to work on your customer service and course management, because you missed the mark big time!  My experience felt like a snap hook right into the water.  Just pure disappointment!"}
{"text":"The golf course was absolutely beautiful but customer service was terrible.  Wanted to replay and no one seemed to know the price.  Even asked before teeing off and was told to call the club house from the 18th hole.  We called the club house and they still did not know and made us come in (a 5 minute drive) to speak with the pro who of course was not there when we arrived.   The day before wanted to change our tee time and was told to speak to the pro who of course was not there!  They made us feel not welcomed."}
{"text":"Nice course, very scenic. Some of the holes are something out of a video game. But I don't think i could ever go back on principle. Had a really bad experience with the starter there. He HIGHLY offended me, especially after i paid the $150 to play there.

So we are there with a group of 7 of us on a golf trip. Our group ended up being the 3 some. There was a single that they had to pair with us. I get that they had to put the single with our group. We didn't mind at all. But they forced the single to ride along in one of our carts rather than give him his own cart. I kindly told the starter that i didn't feel comfortable riding with someone i didn't know and would prefer that he rode in his own cart. The starters response: \"well it looks like you're not playing golf today then\" in the rudest tone possible just about made our entire group walk away and ask for our money back before we tee'd off. It was so ridiculous, and most of us were in shock that he even had the balls to say that to me(or anyone for that matter). He's a starter for god's sake, and i don't think the management at this course would want their starter leaving that kind of impression on a customer right before they are about to start a round of golf. Especially for the price this course charges. I still think about it to this day and this happened 2 months ago. I send clients out to courses in Arizona all the time, and also travel there a lot myself in the winters for personal and business trips. But there's no way I will ever send someone to this place. Not EVER in a million years. And if someone from this course is reading this, you can thank your starter for that. 

We played there Saturday, May 3, 2014 and tee'd off around noon-1pm if i'm not mistaken...just an fyi to anyone on staff at this course who reads the yelp reviews"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful course wonderfully maintained. Great greens, fast and true. We played today October 28 and the course was perfect. The course marshals actually do something if there is slow play!!

{"text":"2 part review.  Golf course is fantastic! Greens are in great shape and fast. Course is always in great shape. The help is the opposite. They cater to a small group of members treating them great... the rest of the guests are treated liked \"you don't belong\" and the attitude seems to be we are only helping you because we have to. I have played a lot of premium courses that treat customers far better than this mid Tier course. I would expect a Pretentious attitude if it was private, but a public course...."}
{"text":"The course is beautiful, but the service is terrible.  I have tried booking a tee time that I won with the golf pro and he is not responsive at all, never returned my calls.

The time was drawing near the use by deadline and they just ate up the clock till end of year so they wouldn't have to honor the commitment.  I am not sure I will ever play there again.

Chris T."}
{"text":"They just opened it to the public. They limit the number of tee times so play was very fast. The greens were very very fast. In my oppinion its the best course in the west valley."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of playing Quintero twice, and when ever I go to AZ I will make it a point to play there again. It is my favorite course in the area, and I always recommend it to friends that are traveling in AZ.

{"text":"Played golf there today and worst experience ever! We had NO one behind us and the marshals harassed us all day on our pace. Spend your money somewhere else. Don't make the drive for a bad atmosphere to play in."}
{"text":"I always take my golf visiting buddies to this BEAUTIFUL golf course.  Yes, it's a little further out but it's well worth the drive.  Immaculate course, great layout & terrific service.  (Troon Golf should send this team to Troon North  to teach the boys at TN
a little about how to deliver great customer service!). 

My favorite public course in AZ.  #2?  Dove mountain.  #3?  Boulders South.  Sorry Troon North .  You need to improve service. at every level, to make your way back to the top, inspite of your beautiful courses!"}
{"text":"The golf course is excellent. The conditions were great, and the greens rolled really well. Some of the views are spectacular as well.

So why does Quintero only get 2 stars? The service was incredibly poor. We were hassled by the ranger on our first round of the day, but since we were a little slow, we didn't mind; we thought that would mean a good pace of play in the afternoon. Were we wrong! We played 16 holes in just over 5 hours, and we saw the ranger just twice. And what did he say when we asked if they were going to speed up play? He offered us a brownie. Both times. For the price we paid, this completely unacceptable. 

We attempted to contact the head pro the next about an explanation and a partial refund, and all we got was a pissy attitude. 

Also, we had 45 mins between rounds, which should be plenty of time to get a burger. Instead, were told by the waitress after 30 mins that they hadn't yet started cooking them. So we had hustle out the to grill near the 1st tee, and barely made our time. 

Overall, just abysmal service, which is a shame for such a great golf course. For $328 for 2 rounds and a 45 min drive to get there, I would like to have a better experience, but it didn't come close."}
{"text":"8 of us get together once a year and golf 5-6 rounds, always at a Troon location.  When we finished up at Quintero the staff told us to leave our clubs and when we are ready to go they would load them for us in our vehicles.  When we returned, a set was missing, not just any set either.  Valued at over $3,500 my friend has been waiting for over 2 weeks for a resolution with absolutely no good news.  I doubt very much we will be attending Quintero (which by the way is a great course unless you value your clubs) and may re-think our yearly commitment to Troon as well."}
{"text":"Arrived at the course with 7 other female caddy's and weren't allowed on the course because we are women. The staff and management were very rude. They yelled at us for being on the course although we had called a month in advance to make sure it was okay for us to caddy, and still were not allowed to caddy. Very unprofessional course. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Everything about this course is 5 stars. Great customer service, very friendly staff, great signage, and the course is amazing! Keep em straight!"}
{"text":"Played here last summer and we had a great experience. One of the better courses we have played and would love to go back. It was extremely hot since it was the beginning of August. But we teed off at 8AM so it wasn't really bad until the back 9. Great conditions and fun par 3's"}
{"text":"Grill has great food perfect for lunch. Husbands golfed an we met for lunch between rounds. Loved exploring the golf course. Incredibly beautiful   
very fresh produce in salads and cooked to order.  awesome Cobb salad, turkey club sandwich on sour dough was delicious with Avocado slices and lots of meat. Yummy French fries skinny, crisp on outside moist inside   Wanted to try wings they looked and smelled awesome but we were too late. Great onion rings. Drinks in foam cups - which if you don't realize that is a great thing 
If you're on the Carefree 74 hey stop for lunch you'll be happy you did"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful and we'll manicured golf course.  It is quite a drive to get there and a ten minute drive to get to the first hole . There are only about 6 homes on the entire course.  There are many  holes with tremendous elevation changes on the par threes. It is a tough course but fair. There are very few players and the pace of play is good unless your game is off. Their food is excellent and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Yelp was created so cry baby's can attempt to hurt a businesses reputation. I have golfed at this course a number of times with my wife or with other couples.  They are very accommodating to women.  In the case of the 5 women from the same golf group giving Quintero one star, clearly there was an underlining reason for not allowing them on the course."}
{"text":"Best public course in Phoenix in my opinion!   Every hole is picturesque and feels like what desert golf should be: penalties for missing but not so narrow that you have to hit an iron off every tee.  The elevation changes make the course a joy to play and has been in great shape every time I've played it.   The only annoyance is the drive in the cart from the club house to the first tee.  Cool factor for having a gold simulator in the bar now!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful golf course with nothing around it.  The fees are a too pricey.  You have to put up with swatting flies all day, and that is annoying when you're paying $130 to play golf.

The ranger came up and told us to move a lil faster and we were pacing ourselves because the foursome in front of us was not going anywhere, yet no-one was in front of them.  We were on 8.  We finished quickly and when we arrived at #9, the foursome was still around the green and we waited for over ten minutes.  We waited on every shot for the rest of the round and NEVER saw that ranger again.  Sometimes we women get treated differently, and it really annoys us.

The GPS system on the cart stopped after 9 holes too.

Again, if you are going to charge that much for golf, make the experience awesome.  I would have given the course a 4, but the rest of the story made it something, that would make us not return to.  There are two many other courses in the area."}
{"text":"This place rocks!.  Every hole looks like another high end course's signature hole.  We loved everything about this place from the service, to the driving range and the GPS on the carts, etc.  Also the cart girls were perky and friendly.  One even helped us find a lost ball and gave my buddy a couple of Pro V1s.  Probably the best course we have played."}
{"text":"Came back and played 2 more rounds this week. Still a beautiful course. The greens and bunkers are in much better shape.  The fairways allow for a lot of roll if you duff one.  Still worth the drive. Pun intended!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best public course in the state. It's a little bit of a drive but it's well worth it. Conditions are immaculate and the greens are the best I've ever seen. Friendly staff - our starter was Jim and he was outgoing and knowledgeable about the course. 

We will be back again."}
{"text":"Went out this morning with a good friend. My first time here, reminds me a lot of the Rock at La Quinta. Staff is very friendly, facility is nice. Tee box and fairways are in great shape. Bunkers are very challenging as is the rough. The most disappointed part of the course are the greens. Very bad shape, and it's not the course's fault. It's all the lazy asses who lays up on the green and do not fix their ball marks! Course needs help here fellas! Not to hard to bend over, even with a beer in one had to repair a ball mark. Other then that it's an awesome place, very affordable during the summer. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Course is beautiful first time played greens fast . Should let you know before book cart path only. Then they want you to carry seed bottle to ball, not happening. Workers could be friendlier and more helpful"}
{"text":"We have not come across staff this unpleasant. Unbelievable when a golf course approved caddies then approves riders with a group of friends of ours we have known for many many years. The pompous belittling and GM yelling at us today and cutting us off from speaking was appalling. I even asked if I can golf instead, they said \"no\".  They were also very happy to tell us that they had a \"full course today\" not just \"8 players\" so essentially they don't need any new business. We realize it is a busy weekend in Scottsdale but that's why we did the ground work of informing the course ahead of time. The other players in a different foursome were disgusting by treatment of us here. There is a way to handle discrepencies -but talking down and belittling people because they are women is not the solution. I golf regularly here in AZ and am so turned off by the staff here, I would never recommend or return."}
{"text":"Went to the course as they participate with Troon Card. However, the course needs to take some lessons in customer service from Troon North or The Phoenician, where both courses make you feel welcome and that they are happy you are there. After 15 mins of checking, they finally honored the Troon Card rate. The rest of the day was great as the course is fantastic. So 2 stars for customer service and 4 stars for the course = 3 stars."}
{"text":"Dad was in town for a week, golfed five different courses and Quinterro was the front runner.  When we pulled up we were greeted by the friendly staff directing us around, good thing because some parts of the course is like a maze.  The course was perfect from the tee boxes to the greens, what a great experience.  I've lived in the valley for nearly fourteen years and this course is in the top three for myself.  Do yourself a favor and play it soon."}
{"text":"This golf course is like a mirage in the desert.
The 1.5-hour drive from Chandler is not a fun trip. Phoenix traffic is always a mess then you
turn onto highway 74, the road that time forgot. It has not changed in 100 years and is still 2 lanes.
    The golf course entrance has a desolate winding route with no man made buildings around.
Some temporary structures appear and so do the cart guys. They are helpful.
   The man in the Pro Shop isn't a Pro, he works for Farmers' Insurance full-time.
Andy from Wisconsin is friendly and rags about how fast the greens are and how tough the course is.
  The journey to the #1 tee and practice area is about 1.5 miles down a lonely road.
The starter is an affable guy from Illinois who also bragged about how fast their greens were
and how tough the course was. The practice greens had just been top dressed and were covered with sand. I asked our starter if the greens on the course were like this and he replied;
\"no, they are much better.\"
   Hole #1 is a short par four, and an easy par, but the greens were covered with sand.
I had been deceived. I should have left here immediately but after the long drive, what the hey.

     I discovered that there are more flies on Quintero than on any of the eight other courses
we've played.
    Also, on our first four holes, we had more maintenance personnel interference than all the other courses combined.
    The \"GPS\" here is rudimentary. There is a small six-inch screen located below and right of the steering wheel with distance to the pin virtually illegible. This is woefully inadequate in comparison to other prime courses.
    Tees are not marked 90% of the time. This will cause a big delay if you are a first-time visitor
because not all tee boxes are in play and many are hidden.  All other courses that we've played clearly mark each tee box.

    The key in playing this course is to stripe a straight drive in the fairway. On par three holes
hitting the green sets you up nice for birdie.
   The second shot on par fours is the most important here. Many times an extra club is required
because the greens are located behind punitive bunkers.
   Sadly, the top-dressed greens took away a lot of the legendary speed but they all seemed to run true as in straight. Do not give away the hole here.
  Rees Jones was channeling a mountain goat on quite a few of these holes. He has designed
a tiered level of tee boxes going up the hillside. The back tees hit from the top and have beautiful vistas. When you wind down to the copper and jade tees, you could find some gnarly tee shots with rocks and vegetation as distractions.
  Because of forced carries and tricky, uneven side hill lies, this course is not recommended for high handicap golfers.

   This course has had a long history of overbooking/overcrowding and horrendous slow play during the high season.
    On a 100 degree day in early May, it took over 4.5 hours to play and we only encountered a ranger once. He was heading to the group in front to sped them up."}
{"text":"Golf course was in great shape.  We fell off pace by 5 minutes due to one bad hole, the marshal hit us up 3 times and at the turn we harassed by another ranger.  Normally I would be worried about being behind but the fact was the group behind us was a hole and a half behind us and we finished on time.   After the round went in to discuss with the manager and the customer service sucked!! I am a troon card holder along with Greyhawk white tee.  Customer service is much better at  Greyhawk and will keep playing  there over the rest of the troon courses and will not renew my card next year."}
{"text":"A beautiful, well-maintained course. Several elevated tees, difficult greens We found everyone to be friendly . The pro shop, the marshall, the cart girl and the waitress and chef at the grill. The food was good with generous portions. My husband left his golf shoes behind and when they were found, Michelle with the lost and found dept., asked Mike, the manager to deliver them to our house in North Phoenix on his way home. We were pleasantly surprised at how nice and accommodating they were!"}
{"text":"If you are in Arizona, play Quintero! Treat yourself to the impeccable fairways, true rolling greens, and stunning desert views. From the moment we drove up the staff anticipated our every need. The host, Mike Poe, greeted us with a friendly smile and took time to answer our questions and describe the course layout. On the course we were wowed at every turn as we wound through the thrilling elevation changes amidst the cacti of the Sonoran Desert. Long ride to the first tee, but worth it! I look forward to playing Quintero again."}
{"text":"Super nice course, well kept! Friendly staff, great service beautiful views. Driving range is nice love the stacking and putting greens by 1st tee. Got my crown back from older brother that plays 2 a week beat him by a stroke. Definitely will be back to play over and over and over again. Thanks for Reading and reading and reading and reading my review."}
{"text":"Played 36 holes here with a group of friends on a golf trip recently. This is by far the best course we played during the trip. We rented a house in Cave Creek so the drive was about 35 minutes to Quintero....so worth it.
This Rees Jones designed course is a challenge, fair, incredibly well laid out, and an amazing value. We played the Grayhawk Raptor course and I can say without question Quintero puts it to shame for the money. Grayhawk is a great layout but for the money it is not even close. 

If you are into golf and in the area do yourself a favor and make the trip to Quintero."}
{"text":"We booked two teetimes through golf now. As we where on our annual winter golf trip, two of our group was supposed to fly in that morning, due to the terrible winter their flight was cancelled. I called the pro shop on the drive over, they said to call golfnow, I called them and they said call the pro shop. They pro shop told me they would charge me for the two folks that canceled. Finally we get golf carts a few minutes before our teetime. We tee off and our second group has a stranger with us. Wait, we paid for all eight players. Why should we play golf with a single when we already paid for everyone?  They are getting double revenue on one teetime. 
We play and it's super slow. The group in front is taking 30 mins to play a hole. The starter is not hurrying them up, all he is doing is giving out brownies.  We tee off at 1.30 and finish at the 15th in darkness. After the round contacted the owner and head of golf, they have yet to respond. This is the last time I play this course. It's run terribly, no responsibility from any of the staff or management. Avoid this course unless you like getting ripped off, slow play, incomplete rounds and brownies!"}
{"text":"Nice course in pretty nice shape, but play is very slow.  The course squeezes too many players on the course which results in a 5 plus hour round.  Today it was over 105 degrees and it took 5 1/2 hours to play 18 holes. Not much fun.  

They have staff on the course passing out cold towels but no one tries to move players alone.

So, if you go, expect a long day, really long if it's it hot out."}
{"text":"Our group all the way from Mexico and Texas booked this trip over a month ago and got the OK from Quintero Golf to have us along as caddies. The gentlemen in our group arrived before us and reminded the staff about us and got another OK. 7 other girls and I showed up right after them and immediately got shut down after they realized we were women. Staff was incredibly rude! Super un professional and literally screaming at us. We have a HUGE clientele and will not be recommending this course."}
{"text":"If you're headed to Scottsdale and looking to play some golf make a trip out to Quintero Golf and Country Club. This course is a little ways off the beaten track but it will be an experience you'll remember. (Temporary clubhouse only). 

This course is semi-private and if you're not a member you need to buy a \"Troon card\" to be able to make a tee time. Worth every penny though because it is rated in the\"top 100\" courses in America and truly a remarkable golf experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the most beautiful desert golf courses I've played!  It is without a doubt a humbling course and the surrounding desert has created quite the residence for many of my golf balls.  The grill station at the turn offering burgers and brats with a huge assortment of condiments was a very nice touch to the experience!

This is the definition of target golf.  For the most part, this course has wide fairways with some room to spray the ball and I may have just been having a bad day, but it sure seemed like I was making a large golf ball donation!

The fairways were the best I've played on down here in the greater Phoenix area, considering it was the end of May.  The first and second cuts of rough were very easy to play out of and were very forgiving if you wanted to hit an iron.  I did feel that the greens were a little burnt from the sun, but were overall in pretty good shape and rolled true.  They were extremely fast as one would expect on a course of this caliber.

I couldn't get over how bad of shape the bunkers were.  Normally I wouldn't complain and after one miserable thin shot would learn to try and pick it clean the next time I end up in a bunker.  Since there are so many bunkers that come into play on this course it needs to be a priority that they are in great shape, especially around the greens.  These bunkers were laced with large rocks and had zero sand to get under the ball.  Playing ping pong between traps over the extremely fast greens really took away from my overall experience.  I hope this was just a mishap.

You win this time Quintero.  I will be back for revenge and I hope to get some of my golf balls back while I'm at it!!!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful golf course every time I come to the Phoenix area I will make a point to play it. The staff is very friendly pace of play was good a challenge every hole. I don't normally buy souvenirs for myself but I did buy a shirt like I said I will play this every time I come to the area"}
{"text":"I'd really like to give this place 5 stars.  Despite all the recent reviews I've just read, I would if it was solely based on service.  But this ultimately is all about golf and for me that was a 3 star experience.

After playing the last round of an annual golf trip here in '14, we decided to do a stay and play thing here in '15.  We made our initial reservation only a few days after we played in '14.  Apparently the guy who booked our deal bailed not too long ago and left no trace of our reservation.  But the staff fully stepped up and honored all of it including letting us use a nice house instead of a condo that had since been taken off the rental market.  They set us up with dinner three nights and went grocery shopping for us before we arrived.  Overall they were very accommodating.

My main knock against Quintero is actually the course itself.  It was in generally very good condition.  The greens had a few blemishes (maybe a little disease or something?) and a large number of ball marks that people simply didn't fix but were still fast, firm and smooth.  The bunkers sucked as they are essentially all hard pan which took a couple of days to fully figure out.  Even then it was near impossible to actually stop the ball out of a bunker.  But my biggest issue is simply that the course isn't that memorable.  Sure, it's beautiful as so many desert courses are.  And there's no housing around.  But there's nothing really special.  I can normally replay my round every night after I play, and can even recall some special rounds for much longer.  I could walk around Pebble Beach tomorrow and place my ball where it was for each shot last July.  Yet a couple of days after our trip I texted a guy a picture I took from the 9th tee, a hole I did remember from the first round I played in '14, and it wasn't until after I'd sent it that I realized there was another hole in the background.  Yet I simply couldn't, and still can't, recall what hole it was despite having played it 4 times in the prior week.  It's just another relatively short par 4 with bunkers guarding one side of the fairway and the desert on the other that plays to an elevated green.  There must be at least 4 holes just like that.  And then there are the downhill par 3s.  They look good but there are 3 of them.  Even the holes that are a bit interesting, like 3, leave you with a short iron to the green.  I think the longest approach I had was an 8 iron but I had several 52 degree wedges.  And I wasn't always hitting driver.  Granted we were playing the Silver tees (our group had a very large range of handicaps) but it was just nothing special.

All that said, the only thing that would really keep me from coming back is the location.  Just when you think you've hit the middle of nowhere you have another 15 minutes to go.  There's truly nothing around.  If I'm going to drive 45+minutes from Scottsdale, which is how we normally do our trip, there are better courses.  My guess is that I'll be back maybe once every few years."}
{"text":"Course is very remote. After making the long drive, one would expect the experience to make up for it; unfortunately, this was not the case. I arrived with 7 other females, all dressed in professional golf attire and smiling faces. The facility was underwhelming and the staff even more so. Incredibly rude, belittling, and unprofessional. I will not be back."}
{"text":"My son just completed the Junior Golf Camp at Quintero Golf Club and it was an AMAZING experience for him. It was well organized and they really went the extra mile to make sure the kids had a great experience. Matt Leaman was so good with the kids and they loved him. Looking forward to getting my son back out on the Quintero Green soon!!"}
{"text":"Avid golfer who plays twice a week. I've played all the great courses in the Phoenix area and this is by far my favorite public course. Each hole is unique and challenging. I feel most poor ratings on here are due to people having bad days on the course and getting frustrated, as this course is difficult ( shot 84 from silver, previous  round shot 71 from blues at TPC - Champions). This course is forgiving off the tee, but you will not get away with mistakes, they will cost you strokes. 

Greens : A+ best in the valley, roll fast and true 
Fairways A
Bunkers B they had a couple that were under maintenance which isn't a big deal in the summer 
Service A+ ( I personally hate the club cleaners in scottsdale but that seems to be everywhere down here)

In summary, if your into golf this place is better than grayhawk,TPC, Troon north, and wekopa. If you want to shoot your best score go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have played this course on 7-31-15 and at least 2x for the last 5 years ...by far the worst condition the course has been in. I kept telling my wife whose first time playing this course that its the best in the valley wow how big of a disappointment for her.  Bad bunkers greens not nearly as nice as before overall average course condition.  If you are going to spend the money go play wickenburg ranch the course is immaculate and for same price you get a free shirt and in 105 heat you will get fast pace of play and perfectly manicured course.  Shame on you Quintero I have talked you up for years no Marshall no pace of play and terrible course condition...you can do better.  So disappointing I really want my money back you are no longer worth 5 star review me talking you up or me spending over the norm for you."}
