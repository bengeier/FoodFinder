{"text":"Very unexpected in a \"strip mall\" area.  Decor is great, menu excellent.  We had pizza and pasta - outstanding crust."}
{"text":"Last minute decision to find this restaurant - we had been told they opened near Vaughan mills. Place is fun decor a good mix of classic and trendy . Food was excellent - pasta with rabbit very good . Pizza with prosciutto and honey delicious . We had some dietary issues and server Susannah very accommodating .  Highly recommend this spot - but please put biscotti on the menu !   Cheri"}
{"text":"Delicious! The calamari dip was great and lobster tail was fantastic! Nice ambient atmosphere and service was 10/10. Our server John was top notch! Ask for him if you go here. Great place for pre NYE dinner!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant., great vibe. I felt like I was downtown. The food is excellent, and not expensive. Owner Patricia came to our table, she definitely knows what she's doing. Nice for a change. We will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Ate here while visiting Canada. The food, service and the ambiance were exceptional! All of the items we ordered (beef carpaccio, grilled octopus, ribeye, spaghetti carbonara and affogato) were absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because we got in 1/2 hour before closing, but you'd expect they should be consistent with their food. I would give a 2 star but since the food was absolutely atrocious it's a 1 star.   Pasta was dry... to the point of it being stuck together and hard to chew. The pasta sauce was runny and no taste. Was it just me? Nope. My friends also had terrible food.   The only thing that I would say was the pizza was good, especially the crust.  Maybe i'll go earlier. Stay away if it's 1 hour before closing! Your food will be disgusting.  DO NOT RECOMMEND!  Yelpers, another hyped place that's ...well basically crap-ola!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place doesn't have more reviews, it's a great little restaurant tucked away near Vaughn Mills shopping center! Immediately when I entered, I was impressed by the expansive ceilings and wine menu.   We ordered a margherita pizza to share, the butternut squash gnocchi, a vegetarian pesto penne pasta, and the orange & apricot salmon. The margherita pizza was nothing to impress - couldn't really taste the basil on it and the cheese was too runny. Both pasta dishes made up for this though, as they were flavorful and portion sizes were extremely generous. The orange and apricot salmon was also soft and well cooked, but the apricot taste was a little off-putting to be honest. It was on a bed of rice with black beans, which were yummy but perhaps not the best pairing for the citrus salmon.   Throughout the dinner, our server was extremely kind and attentive, even when a larger party came in for a dinner party. If you're in the area, I'd recommend this place. If you dine downtown you get half the portions for this price, and you have to pay parking!"}
{"text":"Great lunch while at the Lambo dealership. Started with a cappuccino and then had seafood linguini. Was planning on only eating half but it was so delicious the plate was empty.   Great wait staff and a place to be remembered."}
{"text":"We can here with friends for the first time a few weeks ago. We were able to make a reservation on a Saturday night which scored big bonus points in my books. The place was busy and the atmosphere was chatty and relaxed. Our waiter did take a very long time to serve us which is I'm giving this review 4/5. I ordered a bottle of J Lohr Cabernet Sauvignon, the other couple ordered a glass of Pinot Grisio and Gin and Tonic.  Bread and pepper spread was brought to the table for us to snack on till our food arrived.  For appetizers we ordered the octopus and the ensalata mista. The octopus was really nice, soft an delicate flavour. The salad was fresh and tasty. The other couple ordered a Burrata salad and a 255 bruschetta which was much bigger than expected .  For our main I ordered the truffle rigatoni pasta which was absolutely out of this world amazing. I should have stopped eating 1/2 way through but couldn't get myself to stop. My husband main was the veal masala. The meat was tender and the sauce rich and tasty. The other couple ordered the lamb chops with garlic sautéed rapini and cannelloni beans, he said the meat was cooked to perfection and exceptionally tasty and she ordered Atlantic cod fillets with Israeli couscous and seasonal vegetables. The fish was tender and tasty.  The other couple ordered desserts, a tiramisu and a pana cotte. We ordered a dessert to share, it was tasty but I don't recall it's name.  By far the best part of the experience was that the chef came out of the kitchen at the end of the night and came round to all the tables to see how we enjoyed our meals.  Our meal for the two of us came to $180 plus tip.  I'm looking forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday group dinner on Sept 3rd (a Saturday) and as expected this place became pretty busy after 6pm.  Many places in Vaughan are busy after 6pm on a Saturday night so that's no surprise.  The parking was pretty simple though.  Being near Vaughan Mills there's lots of open space and I ended up getting one of the diagonal spots right in front.  While this restaurant is near Vaughan Mills it's not inside the mall itself thankfully.  That parking lot is a normally a gong show.  Being close to Vaughan Mills has a convenience factor though.  It's not hard to find, there's substantial parking and generally it's not very hard to get to being close to highway 400 etc.  The place is named 255 I'm guessing because their address is 255 Bass Pro Mills Drive.  The restaurant itself has a nice high ceiling and a dark look with soft lighting.  The bar is located in a nice visual spot being sort of the front and center of the service area while the seating area is rather tight.  Tables are really almost uncomfortably close together.  Navigating/negotiating your way around the tables to get up, leave or go to the restroom could be considered hard to do considering the space allowance between tables.  I found the service to be rather attentive and friendly.  The staff always seemed to be happy to serve or smiling if not making jokes but still remaining professional.  The clearing of plates and drinks were well maintained as well.  The food I found to be about satisfactory.  We had ordered salads, calamari friti, a gnocchi plate, and a couple pizzas.  The salads were good and the calamari was very good.  Salads were salad but the calamari was nicely done with a bit of a crunch to the batter with nice sized rings and tentacle pieces.  I like the tentacle parts more than the rings and there was a nice quantity of each.  The gnocchi I seemed to get bored of it pretty fast.  It had a gorgonzola sauce which was thick and rich but I had wish it was even stronger with the cheese taste considering gorgonzola is very rich.  The server had asked if I had wanted a sprinkle of parm on my gnocchi and I had said yes.  I think she was worried that it would probably be too salty or rich for me?  Nope, it was just fine even with the added cheese.  The pizzas were nice but nowhere near I had wished they'd be.  Call me spoiled but I've had my fair share of pizza in my day and perhaps places like Libretto have spoiled me for what Italian pizza should be.  Like a few other places I've had pizza in Vaughan, this pizza may use Italian ingredients but the crust while OK just doesn't meet Neapolitan closeness or the expectation of a place that is supposed to be more Italian that say Pizza Nova.  Still, my wife enjoyed her white pizza with prosciutto while I had gone with the more spicier 'Nduja which also had arugula as a topping.  The crust served here is thicker, harder and crunchier as opposed to a Neapolitan style being thinner, softer and chewier.  The verdict is decent, but not superb.  While everything else about 255 is good or better than good the food for me is just a pass.  While I can say it's not quite a 4 but better than a 3 perhaps a 3.5?  I don't round up so it'll have to remain a 3 from me.  The service was great and it's a nice place but it feels crowded inside because of their spacing of tables which is what make this place even out."}
{"text":"Very modern chick design and cozy setting. The restaurant gets really busy and full house during dinner time. Absolutely will go back....   Food: 4/5 stars... Great presentation    Wine choice: 3.5/5....not many choices to choose from but can find decent price and less stress of picking one.   Price: 4/5... Lower-mid range. Absolutely great to have a group of friends to dine.   Parking: 5/5.. Easy find. Parking right in front of restaurant.   Service: 3.9/5....the waitress who was serving our table gotten very busy with the full house and others. But another waiter came to every now and then... Only reminder is probably to remember to refill guest's water glass...."}
{"text":"Excellent food and fast service. Reasonable prices as well, I have no complaints about this restaurant! Would highly recommend if you are in the Vaughan Mills area."}
{"text":"I took a group of 4 here for a birthday dinner and was really blown away by the service and the food.   From the outside it looks like a giant restaurant but it's actually quite cozy and intimate, very warm and inviting.  The staff were very friendly and accommodating, answering several questions about the food and being incredibly attentive without being overbearing.  The food was really something special, which is saying something considering the plethora of good Italian options in Vaughan area are.  From the appetizers (carpaccio, calamari) to the mains (rabbit Pappardelle, lobster spaghetti, jumbo shrimp, and ESPECIALLY the out-of-this-world Carbonara) to the desserts (gluten free molten lava cake, pecan pie and incredible coconut cream pie), everyone was really happy with the food.  Everyone was excited to come back and check out more of the food, the menu is really inviting and it was hard to not want to go back and check out the other inviting items.  Great stuff all around and made the birthday girl very happy."}
{"text":"We came in for a late dinner after shopping. We noticed a new Italian restaurant on the outer edge of a row of home furnishing stores and decided to see what it's all about.  The restaurant looked brand new, modern decor with dim lighting, very stylish.  We had a rigatoni alla vodka and a pizza (flammkuchen) that had bacon, creme fraiche and onions. Both were pretty good. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce was good.  Pizza was really tasty, thin crust, just the way I like it. The waitress brought us bread before the mains it seemed to be made with spices and herbs - initially thought it was olives, but after having a few slices I believe there's oregano, chilli flakes, and rosemary in it. It was really good!  The waitress was very pleasant, always smiling with a vibrant personality. She made us feel very welcomed.  Prices are reasonable, not overpriced like many other Italian restaurants and the atmosphere has a nice stylish lounge vibe. It can get a bit noisy I'd imagine as the ceilings were really high and sounds were echoing a lot while we were there and there were 3 other tables near us.  It's worth a try if you're in the area or if you're looking for a new Italian restaurant to try.  Remember, although the bread is amazing, save room for the mains, they're pretty tasty! The fifth star will be for consistency, so it looks like I'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"It being Mothers Day today, I knew it would be busy anywhere we went. We made a reservation to this place three weeks prior. When we got there, they said they wanted to remind us that we were told when the reservation was made that we would be sitting at the high top table (on stools) - No they did not. I neutrally suggested we would just go somewhere else and they managed to find us a proper table. Not a great start.  As Lambert mentioned the tables are too close together. My kid was ready to lose it on the table behind us that was extremely loud and I reminded her she too was once younger. I was amused when the mom loudly sung Itsy Bitsy Spider. When the adult male started pounding his fists and cutlery on the table, and loudly chanting \"we want pasta!\", I offered my child to sit on the other side of the table. I heard the server quietly apologize so maybe their meal was delayed.  I did not realize that there would be a special menu for Mothers Day so my plan to give my kid a pizza, which I knew she could eat, was foiled. No pizza. She did enjoy the $29 salumi plate which she knew she would like and was able to eat. I ate the truffle peaches from her plate. Mmm The truffle and Ragu pasta were also delicious and filling.  Didn't end up having dessert because not sure if my kid could have any so we all passed.  Food 4/5 Atmosphere 2/5 May return again on a less busy night, but only if we are sure in advance what the menu will be."}
{"text":"Time to check out the new Italian Restaurant in Vaughan. Tucked away behind Vaughan Mills this place a hidden Gem.  Even though Yelp and a various other website rate this a simple restaurant it is far from it.  The place is nice with a very modern ambiance and some rustic elements.  Food is very good here yet slightly more expensive than the neighboring two other family restaurants in the plaza.  I ordered two pizzas one pasta two appetizers and a bottle of wine for three people and the bill was close to $200.  The Gorgonzola gnocchi was perfectly done and you can taste the cheese.  Vegetarian pizza was very nicely done enjoyed every bite the other pizza was slightly too salty.  The appetizers including polenta fries and Caesar salad we're done to perfection. I would say it's better than most others in the area.  Drinks including the house wine and coffee or excellent.  We ordering the house-made desserts since the other items like cheesecake or just brought in from a local supplier.  Overall I was very happy with the meal and I enjoyed being there. I will come back for date night and special occasions."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely outstanding! The grilled octopus starter, beef carpaccio and charcuterie platter were to die for! Fresh ingredients. Massive wine list. Americans coffee sooo good! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner here. Apparently reservations are normally required on a Friday but they fit us in.   The kids enjoyed the pizza. It was the perfect size for two of them and the quality of the crust and sauce was spot on.   I had a veal steak. It was a generous portion and very tasty.  Succulent and rich as you expect. My wife had a seafood pasta dish. The pasta was perfectly cooked al dente. The scallops and shrimp were fresh, crisp, and juicy.   For dessert we had a lava cake which was molten in an interesting way that you don't normally get."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever had. Absolute incompetence. The staff had no clue what they were doing and the bartender was useless."}
{"text":"Love this place.. atmosphere.. food and staff are amazing.  Highly recommended lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Rib eye slightly overcooked when we wanted it medium rare but still good, lamb chops were flavourful, truffle pasta had a nice creaminess to it, arugula pizza was very meaty. overall on the pricey side but still good"}
{"text":"Good food and service, felt as something was missing though. The service was decent and the food was decent."}
{"text":"Grilled calamari and steak were exceptional. The calamari was tender and presented beautifully. It had a very well balanced herbal sauce that went wonderfully with a squeeze of lemon. The steak was a well marbled rib eye cooked with precision to medium rare, as well as, seasoned just right. My guest had the ricotta stuffed angnitolli with rosé, and they found it delicious. My only issue with the dining experience was that the list for red wine by the glass was very limited. As for the ambiance, this place has a stunning interior with high ceilings that give it a romantic vibe even during the day. The service was warm and friendly. Even though this place is by the mall in the burbs, it has the feel of a great downtown restaurant and Italian food that rivals some of the best in the city. I was pleasantly surprised and it is truly is a hidden gem. I look forward to trying the lamb chops on my next visit."}
{"text":"Had the calamari and fantastic  Loved the bread they serve as well and Dianna rocks. Great server  Nothing nicer than the owner - Patricia- dropping by your table to make sure everything is perfect"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I had dinner at 255 on a Saturday night. The restaurant was busy, but there were still several tables available. The restaurant looks small from the front but behind the wall of wines are tons of tables that are unfortunately spaced close together. There was a person pushing a stroller who had to ask a patron to push their seat in to get through. The wait staff seemed quite adept at avoiding bumping into patrons while holding plates of food.  Our waiter didn't come by until after appetizers were served. It was another person, Patrick, who served us water, took our orders, and brought us bread. We ordered the fried calamari, the pizza americana, and the truffle rigatoni. The calamari was tasty, soft, light, and freshly battered with a tasty mayo sauce. The pizza was just okay. I enjoyed the crust, which was slightly chewy on the inside but crunchy on the outside. The pasta was okay as well. The rigatoni were not all cooked to the same doneness. The sauce was good, savory with a bit of cheese flavor to it.  Overall the food was good, though a little pricey for what you get. Service could be improved."}
