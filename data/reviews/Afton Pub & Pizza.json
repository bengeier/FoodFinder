{"text":"We built our own pizza as their specialty selections weren't to our liking. We ordered the large size. The flavor of the pizza was very good, the sauce, everything fresh and delicious. The crust was not cooked well in the center, though, and was not crisp like NY style normally is. Not doughy but not cooked well. The outside was great. Then the cookie dessert was cooked at much too high of a temp and was burned. We ordered another and this one was raw.  After we sent the first cookie dessert back, our waiter disappeared. We did not see him again before we left! We flagged the manager down to finish our transaction. This place is in the south, maybe it is considered rude to send something back?"}
{"text":"We go to this pizza place almost every week for girls night out. I have tried almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed.  The Cesar Salad is delicious. The fried zucchini appetizer or the garlic knots are fantastic. The service is friendly and attentive.

The manager Cameron always speaks to us and makes sure that our food came out good. Not many managers make it a habit to know their frequent customers.  On occasion he has even brought out our food to us just to say hello.

If you love pizza or Italian you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I think that The Mediterranean pizza is delicious. My kids love the pizzas. Our two  toddlers can eat one of the children's pizza for dinner. They have a great beer selection. The wings are spot on."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Kinda hidden back of shopping center.  Food was good.  Good local hang out."}
{"text":"I've had pretty much everything they have to offer as it's right around the corner from me! Their pizza and calzones are delicious- topped and filled generously and always fresh. Some of the pastas have been a bit bland, like the Alfredo. It could use some work jazzing it up. Overall though, the food and service is always great."}
{"text":"I went for a birthday dinner (the restaurant was not aware of this at the time) with family this Tuesday, and received THE best customer I've ever had in a restaurant (or anywhere for that matter).  The manager was helping wait tables (ours being one of them) as they were very busy with kids night.  They were friendly, the food was quick and DElicious, and just over all, truly went above and beyond.  I'm a forever customer."}
{"text":"This is a cute neighborhood pizza place. The staff are very friendly and the food is good. We went for lunch and found that they have a great special. You can get a slice of specialty pizza and a salad (or cup of soup)  for $6.50 ($5 if you get a slice of cheese pizza instead of the specialty).

I went with a slice of the specialty pizza -the 4x4 - that came with four types of meat. I got the house spinach salad which came with strawberries, pine nuts and balsamic vinaigrette. They were both good. 

We also started with the breaded zucchini slices as an appetizer. They were very good. The breading was light and tasty. The accompanying sauce was really good (light and fresh).  

We set outside on the patio. It was very nice. A part of the patio is covered, which is really nice. 

Overall, I enjoyed my experience. This place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"We went to Afton Pub & Pizza for our anniversary and let me tell you what a fantastic restaurant it is we had such a amazing time the food was awesome and delicious the service was amazing, Benjamin & Kate went out of there way to makes us feel welcome we just love this place definitely recommend and will be coming back very soon"}
{"text":"Chicken Alfredo. I have eaten ramen noodles that have more flavor and satisfied me more.

Fried Ravioli app. Tasted like something I picked up in the frozen food aisle and nuked in the microwave.

Cajun Queen pizza. Pretty good actually. 5/10 would eat again. 

Service was okay."}
{"text":"Not the best nor the worst pizza in Concord, NC.  Heavy on salty sauce and very light on poor quality cheese.  Crust was thin, but not crispy.  Try Due Amci or La Roma for five star pizza."}
{"text":"Smokers can come out and plop down at the outside tables. We do not like this at all. This past Saturday a lady sat down at a table outside and brought her ashtray out. Smokers should not be allowed to share the patio with nonsmokers. Otherwise, we are very happy regular customers who tip well and enjoy the food and service."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Afton Pub & Pizza in Concord, NC. This family owned restaurant offers a complete list of Italian dishes, specialty pizzas, sandwiches and a variety of appetizers. 

Dora here. Afton Pub & Pizza (Pub) is the sister to Afton Tavern (Tavern), my go-to restaurant (read favorite). From the picture, you might be able to tell it's tucked in a mixed residential/retail environment, a fabulous, relaxing place to hangout on the weekend or stop by for dinner on your way home from work. While we visit the Tavern for our favorite salads, the Pub is all about the pizza for us. :)

We start with Garlic Knots. Warm fresh baked dough, drizzled with garlic butter, flaked with parmesan cheese and served with marinara sauce. These garlic knots were large, soft, and full of garlicky flavor and the marinara sauce complemented well. They were outstanding and I could have made an entire meal just eating them. 

Dora here. Me too! Buttery. Soft. Doughy. Lick-your-fingers for the last speck of parmesan delicious!

We followed that with a Ryan's 4 X 4 pizza. Pepperoni, bacon, prosciutto, and a ton of cheese including mozzarella, parmesan, Monterey jack, and cheddar with a hint of red sauce. This pizza was great, cooked perfectly, and loaded with ingredients. This thick crust pie is the best that we have tasted since living in North Carolina. 

Dora here. Everybody has their favorite pizza, right? I'm a Chicago style pizza fanatic, but good luck finding a deep dish like that here! The Pub's 4x4 comes in a close second. Thick and cheesy, with just the right amount of dough to cheese ratio, and I really appreciate that it's not heavy on the marinara. Totally satisfying for those pizza cravings, and of course, we brought much of this big boy home. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"The pizza is bad among other things. Sauce needs work. Food overall has gone downhill. Only come here if your needing pizza late and if this is the only place open."}
{"text":"Food is always great but lately the customer service has been slacking. I definitely recommend the BBQ chicken pizza. It's very flavorful!"}
{"text":"Great food! Very impressed by this place the nachos were fantastic I could have licked the plate! The lunch special was also very nice but the nachos made us fans! Friendly service and a great meal! We will def be back!"}
{"text":"This is the place we just keep trying to like. Primarily because it's close to our home. But alas it's really hard to like. If Afton Pizza didn't serve alcohol it would go out of business. The food quality is average. The servers are unfriendly and untrained. Our server stated she had no idea if a cocktail was sweet. This restaurant could improve by having better pizza and a more friendly staff."}
{"text":"THE BEST thin gluten free crust I've had (sorry Brixx). No gf beer. Excellent pizza - bbq chicken and the white pizza. My celiac friend and I ate one of each. (Oops! SO GOOD). Not to be missed if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"They're starting to get really skimpy on their pizza toppings I've noticed this about a month or so ago I ordered pepperoni and mushrooms Pizza and some slices had hardly anything on them. Pizza is a very profitable item they don't need to skimp this always happens when restaurants are doing well.  , they get greedy"}
{"text":"We take the kids up weekly for the kids night out event. I'm not sure how well versed I am on Pizza and what is best between NY and Chicago styles (and I have had both shout out to Lou Malnatis), but in my humble opinion this hidden gem has he BEST PIZZA in the charlotte area. The staff is very friendly and we have never been exposed to anyone who was smiling and cheerful. Our family looks forward to our weekly visit!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today at lunch with some of my family.  I got the Mediterranean pizza.  It was just ok.  The pizza wasn't hot, but I just ate it cause I was starving.  My sister sent her pizza slice back cause it wasn't warm either.  So there seems to be an issue with serving pizza possibly pre-made and not heating it enough.  My 7 year old niece got sausage and cheese pizza and she really liked it, but she doesn't care about temperature of her food.  I did however bring my leftovers home and heated them, and it was much better.  My nephew got the lunch spaghetti and meatball (yes, uno meatball), and I tasted it and it was good although he didn't like it.  The meatball was big, so it was enough for the lunch portion.  The calamari was good and the boom sauce was great.  We got the cookie pizza and peanut butter brownie desserts and those were both amazing.  The service was quick and very friendly.  I would definitely try it again, maybe try something different.  Overall, a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Our group of 7 rolled in for dinner and were pleasantly surprised with this place. We called ahead to see if we needed a reservation and they had a table set up for us when we arrived. I started with a minestrone soup, which was delicious, and shared an enormous margherita pizza. There are only two sizes, 10\" and 18\", and it would be nice to have something in between. Regardless, the pizza was very good. It wasn't quite eat-the-crust good, but nicely done. Prices were fair and the wine list was very good for a casual pizza place. A solid choice!"}
{"text":"In love with this place!  Always as good as it gets.  The pizza is delicious, and the bar always has something great on tap.  The atmosphere is wonderful, and allows a great place to catch up with friends.  

The servers and bartenders are excellent, and the management truly shines.  David, one of the managers, is always moving from table to table making sure the customer experience is nothing short of amazing.  David is almost always there, and it makes the dining experience that much better knowing that he is fully vested in an exceptional lunch, dinner, or trip to the bar for all of the pub's guests.  

I love the Pub, and would recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the pizza here every single time. Which should be expected when you have \"Pizza\" in the name. Seriously, I could probably have their pizza twice a week. 

Also, they have really good drink specials through out the week. I don't remember the dates, but one is $2 domestic bottles, and a half price pitcher night, which is just fantastic with a pizza and some friends. 

The wait staff seems to be new, and that's why I won't give them four stars. A few times I've walked in and the place was pretty dead, but we still had to wait for some one to notice us so we could be seated. I don't mind wait staff talking to each other, but you got to look out for customers coming in and finish your story later. 

Also the food that isn't pizza related has not been the best. My fiance ordered the chick Alfredo and well, I think chef boyardee could have pulled it off better. The chicken was dried out, the sauce was tasteless, I guess the noodles were done correctly. It seemed the kitchen staff wasn't prepared and completely thrown off when a non-pizza order came in.  The appetizers are also hit or miss. 

Overall, you have to come here for the pizza, the drink specials, oh and you get crayons to color on the paper tablecloths! Stick to the pizza, enjoy a beer, and watch one of the main TVs on the bar side and have yourself a good night out!"}
{"text":"The lively environment offers excellent pizza. Our large group visited the Afton pub on half-price pizza night. We had the pizza and enjoyed it. It's a good bake with a balanced amount of toppings. Our children's pizza for the little ones was a bit too crispy--some of the crust was burned. While a crispy crust would have been acceptable for the adults, the kids skipped those pieces and we left much of the pizza on the table.

While the pizza was tasty, the service was harried, confused, and slow. One member of our party, picked up her own drink at the bar after waiting some time for it to arrive. The waiter brought us a free order of garlic knots because of the long wait. We were having a good time so the wait wasn't a big deal. Though they could improve the service or number of servers, especially when offering special deals."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and the food is solid, not mind blowing but solid overall.  Understand that this is not your typical pizza joint, their pies are more ambitious and the ingredients are of a premium quality, including prosciutto not ham, thick sliced pepperoni, among others. So you going to pay a premium.  They also have great salads and a good selection of  Italian entrees.  Check out the patio for a great view of the sunset.  Service was top notch as well.

Patio - Yes
Happy Hour - Yes"}
{"text":"Had dinner here one evening and a few days later, the charge cleared my account for more than the total I was expecting. I called and asked someone to look into it. I was told that receipts were stored \"at the owner's house\" and someone would call me back. I called again several days later and still have no answer to why I was charged more than I should have. I always write the tip and total on my copy
Of the receipt so I know how much to expect out of my account. Could have been a simple mistake on my or their part, but a call back would have been nice."}
{"text":"We sat outside and enjoyed the breeze. Staff was friendly and efficient.  We \"built our own \" pizza. It was delicious. Crust was done perfectly."}
{"text":"After waiting for an hour for our table,  on a Tuesday night where kids under 12 eat free,  we ended up walking out.   Granted our party was 8 adults, with two toddlers,  so we knew that it was going to be a bit of a wait.   When the server came and took our drink order and appetizer,  we were ready to order.  He cane back with our drinks about 8 minutes later,  saying that he was going to put the appetizer order in.   Now at this point its been an hour and a half since we've walked in the door,  and the server was saying how crazy its been all night. They weren't even that busy and could have accommandated us.   Now if you advertise \"kids under 12 eat free, \" then be prepared for it with staff and room for parties.   I went and spoke to the manager who wasn't paying any attention to what I was saying and very rude.   The server was giving us looks as we were walking out.   I would have rather spent my money elsewhere.  We won't be going back,  at least on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Pizza tastes good, but, picked up my order and got home to find pepperoni (one of two toppings) missing. Should have checked before I left, but, ordered online so it was in writing. Little disappointed."}
{"text":"The best chicken marsala hands downs !!! My favorite thing on the menu i come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"We drove about 30 min to what we thought would be good pizza and it was NOT the case. It's a nice restaurant in a nice neighborhood with plenty of convenient parking. 

 We got there around 3 and the place was fairly empty, but somehow hostesses LOVE seating everyone together! Our server/bartender was friendly and professional and I have nothing negative to say about the service. However the food won't be so lucky. 

 The best food item that arrived at our table was the fried mozzarella, they were delicious! The Chicken Parm was good, but the pasta was dry and their tomatoe sauce is loaded with onions and chunks of tomatoes. I was feeling pizza so I custom made a 10\" pie with Italian Sausage and fresh basil. The pizza looked good, but it had a cardboard consistency and the sausage didn't taste authentic. 

 The 10\" pie will cost you about 10$ as for the pasta they start at 15$, they have some interesting dessert items, but we weren't feeling it. I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"The pizza is great! I like the Cams white pizza, the Ryan 4x4 and the shrimp kaboom pizza. Theres a nice beer selection and live music on Fridays. It's a great neighborhood pizza spot and a wonderful addition to Concord. All the staff and mangers are wonderful, and they go out of their way to say hello and make all their guests feel welcomed and appreciated. Especially Cameron!"}
{"text":"Omg the pizza is melt in your mouth good. Best pizza I have had since I've been in the south and I'm  from jersey! Will be back! You will thank me for this  recommendation"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in the food. I had spaghetti. The meatball was delicious, but there was minimal sauce and a puddle of pasta water on the plate. I did taste another's lobster ravioli and that was tasty. Would think a basic pasta dish could have been done better. The bread was a hard knot with no flavor and we had to ask for cheese for our plates. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and it was great! Server was very attentive. Food was delicious. Prices were good. Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had a very poor experience here. The hostess could not have been less interested in helping us. She seemed agitated by our presence. Our waitress was no better. She half listened to our order and had no intention of really \"waiting\" on us. Since she did not listen, of course out order came out wrong. The manager on duty came out, took our pizza, and recooked it with the missed toppings just thrown on top of the old pizza. We have been here before and had decent service so our visit this time was super disappointing."}
{"text":"New guy messed up the order, management went above and beyond to fix the mistake. Really astounded at the efforts of the staff and management to make the customers satisfied."}
{"text":"Ok, so, my actual rating would be more like 3.75, but that's a lot closer to 4 than 3. 

Here's the rundown...

We went in late on Thursday night. The NFL game was on HD TVs EVERYWHERE in the bar area which is where we sat. The game was nice and loud. As a football fan THIS WAS GREAT!

The restaurant, including the bathroom was very clean. Our server was super sweet, she had that Southern hospitable swagger. 

There were a few guys there at the bar watching the game, and we're probably on beer number 8 or 10. Nice guys.

Parking was super easy.

Now for the food...

Italian Wedding Soup- 3.95- This soup was very tasty. I was actually caught off guard by how good it was. Nice BIG meatballs, lots of fresh spinach, flavorful broth. 

Buffalo Chicken Calzone- 3.75- This dish comes served with two big sides of blue cheese and wing sauce. It is packed with chicken and cheese filling. However, I detected some onions and peppers that didn't seem to fit the dish. Specifically, the texture didn't seem to match. All in all it was good til the last bite.

David's Chicken Marsala- 2.8- Marsala seems to be an easy dish to make, but not an easy dish to make great. The sauce was good, no shortage of mushrooms, but the dish just seemed to fall a little flat for me. It didn't pop. It was pretty average as far as chicken Marsala goes. 

Pizza- 3.65- I'm not sure what kind of pizza my buddy ordered, I know it had meat on it. It was a personal sized pizza. Good cheese coverage, nice crunchy crust that was cooked just right. 

Garlic knot- 4.25- Included with my entree was a garlic knot. It was cooked perfectly! The outside was nice and firm with the inside being slightly doughy. Garlic knots don't get much better than this...they do, however, get a lot worse. 

Cooked spinach- 3.75- The spinach was fresh, and loaded with garlic. It was a nice change of pace both texturally and taste from the chicken Marsala. 

I would recommend you give this place a whirl. I enjoyed my meal tonight."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Very nice staff.  My absolute favorite is the cookie pizza.  If you like the cookie skillet at Afton Tavern, this is equally as good."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars based on the bang for the buck. The Cajun pizza is amazing and kids eat free on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Went and tried this place based off of its reviews. Well Lauren and I were not Disappointed, I had a 10in 4X4 and Lauren had the 10in Cajun Queen. 

    So the atmosphere of the place looks like a nice little neighborhood restaurant/bar, it was empty when we went there but that was probably due to it down pouring. Lauren had sangrias, and said that they tasted amazing and fresh and I had a beer. They have 7 or 8 tv's in the bar area and of them had MOTO GP on so I was hooked and happy. Ok now let's get to the pizzas the 4x4 has pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto, bacon and tons of cheese. The sauce has a good flavor and the crust has a good bite/chew. It was so good I ordered another one to go for work the next day. 
The Cajun queen had shrimp, cheese and I would assume a yum yum sauce on it not 100% tho. Lauren loved it but I'm not a fan of yum yum sauce. 
     Lauren ordered desert and got the cookie/ brownie ice cream thing. It was good but I'm not into sweets that much so only had a few small bites. 
      So all in all we had a great experience and will be back"}
{"text":"Great pizza deal on Monday night's. I love that they use quality ingredients and the choices are not all basic. My favorite is the Cajun queen. I think that was it's name. Very Good!"}
{"text":"This is a great little pizza joint. Seems like everything is handmade to order and taste fantastic. I like the Ryan 4X4 pizza and the meatball and pepperoni pizza. Both are amazing! They even have this dessert that is made out of nutterbutters.....yes it's amazing as well."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner, excellent service, the food came out crazy fast, and the price was about $25 less than we usually spend on dinner as a family of 5 (even with an extra guest!)
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"****Disclaimer - none of us tried the pizza, we probably should have. Everything we ordered was underwhelming. The baked ziti and chicken Parmesan sub were just ok. The chicken marsala was so tough I couldn't even cut it with a fork or knife. The dessert on the other hand was soooo good! We got the peanut butter brownie and WOW! I will come back because that was so good other things might be too. Our server was wonderful, only reason I'm giving it 3 stars. Otherw"}
{"text":"Great bar restaurant great staff great food bar could be less money but great place to chill with friends and family"}
{"text":"DLish!!!!!!!! This place is great!! 
I'm a food trucker and the food here is awesome!! 
Calamari= excellent
Pizza = excellent 
Great service"}
{"text":"Good pizza joint. Love the atmosphere. They've got a dining area and a bar area. Good for groups, families, or for a date. Service was excellent. The pizza was good NY style pizza. I'd recommend this place and I'd go back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Local brews on tap and cool little bar area. They have a nice patio too if you're out with friends. If you're looking for a great app then go with either the bruschetta or zucchini chips."}
{"text":"We tried the place even though health department score was 92.5. Service awful. Got three beers for me and my girlfriends took 27 minutes before waitress came back."}
{"text":"Great pizza and awesome crème brûlée. The owner felt our pizza was overcooked so  made a second one for us  even though we said it was fine .   Now that is great service."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious!  We stopped for a quick slice and ended up ordering a large for dinner!"}
{"text":"Picked up a 4x4 and a Margherita pizza. The crust was thinner than a regular hand tossed pizza, which is my favorite kind of crust. Both pizzas were fantastic. The toppings were great and we really enjoyed them. Not much else to say...just some great pizza."}
{"text":"I visited Afton on a Saturday night to check out the atmosphere I had heard about.  I wasn't hungry so I sat in the bar area to enjoy some of the $4 house wine and March Madness.  What a deal!  I was quite content with the cabernet sauvignon that was available.  They were playing Music Bingo thus the music was extra loud, in my opinion.  I was successful at being civil by not putting in my ear plugs!  However, with some good wine, I didn't mind after a while.  The place was jammed packed with folks having fun and this gave me a warm, neighborly feeling, wishing I could find a place like this in my area.

The Afton menu is varied and the eggplant fries that I saw were tempting.  I will definitely visit Afton again."}
{"text":"Amazing! Pizza is comparable to Wolfman (super delicious). Service was outstanding, great selection of craft beers. Better half ordered a pizza; the crust and ingredients were high quality. I ordered a calzone that was cooked to perfection with no shortage of stuffings. As soon as we sat the bartender approached our table because our server was busy. He asked us what type of craft beers we like and introduced us to a few new flavors (he was extremely knowledgeable!). 1/2 off pitchers on Saturdays, including craft beers! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just picked up my second pizza from the Afton Pub. Last week the large pizza was great. It had a firm crust and could be picked up and eaten. Today the same pizza was very soggy and could only be eaten with a fork. The dough in the center of the pizza was severely under done. There probably won't be a third pizza now because I'm unsure of what I will get. Had this been my first pizza from this place I definitely would not have returned and my rating would have been one star"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner and we were thoroughly impressed. The Sunday night crowd was light but that helped us be seated immediately. We started with the Zucchini Crisps, which were delicious light tasty breading, thinly sliced zucchini, fried perfectly and dusted with Parmesan, served with red sauce and a side of ranch. Excellent appetizer!  We ordered our standard: pepperoni and extra cheese. The pizza did not disappoint either. The crust was light at the edge where you want it to be, thin and crispy(not soggy which you sometimes get with a thinner crust) on the bottom. The pepperoni were small but very thick and delicious. The cheese was perfect. Overall, a very nice experience. We will be back!"}
