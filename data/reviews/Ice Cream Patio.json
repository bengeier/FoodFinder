{"text":"The hot sauce was fantastically fabulous. The beer was cold and plentiful. So plentiful in fact, that when the waiter poured our glasses, it foamed up and ran all over the table.   Speaking of the table, it was orange. So orange, it seemed to be proud of its orangeness. The hot sauce and the orange table were the highlights of the meal.   I mean, if you like the colour orange, than this place is for you. And if you like hot sauce that will put hair on your chest, this place is totally for you. The dish even had a few long black hairs already on it, it is that strong, and tasty.   So, if hot sauce and the colour orange are your thing, try this place. Or, if you are in to table beer, hairy dishes, and pizza that is quicker than Delissio and almost as tasty, then you may want to try it."}
{"text":"Good place but it's very pricey, I won't be ordering on a regular basis. Fried calamari was good, pizza was cold by the time I got it. Maybe I should of tried the dessert lol"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Been here many times and loved it every single time.  I have brought my children here and  met with girlfriends here.  It was always a pleasant experience.  One of the times I came with a friend, she wanted her pasta a certain way and they told her they would make her pasta anyway she wanted it with whatever she wanted to put in the sauce.  Not many restaurants cater to clients like that!  It turned out delicious!  I usually have their pizza which is thin crust and always scores big with everyone I bring.  Ignore the bad reviews and try this place.  Well worth it.  UPDATE:  I revisited this place a couple years ago (2104) and they had moved from their original location. Very nondescript venue with little ambiance. Food had declined in value and taste. Will not visit again."}
{"text":"Grilled calimari was charred, tough and tasteless. Steak salad was soggy and bland. Also, they never asked me how I wanted my steak cooked- it was way over done and chewy. Most of the other customers were having pizza- I should of took the hint. I gave them two starts because the server was very nice."}
{"text":"This place is a traditional Italian restaurant. I loved their pizzas, caprese salad and the seafood pasta is amazing.  The service is very friendly. Amazing place, I loved it."}
{"text":"Maybe I  had a changed crew of servers and food because I enjoyed my dining experience there - once in October 2013 and twice this year,   Yes the parking is horrid but the food was quite good...service by the cheerful staff compensated for the slight wait time.   We had seafood platter - at 17  dollars it was cheap because all four of us shared it and it was super - big shrimps, scallop, fish ...  We ordered pasta, pizza, and veal. Everything was delicious.  What made it great was the servers. These ladies are courteous, accommodating and even though they had a long night of working  they remained nice and attentive.   Their bread was warm ... Ok they could improve on the butter offering but it is a casual  place.   Their dessert ICE cream gelato offering were good...  Overall... If you want  good family style Italian cooking, go there..  But watch the wait...it is busy every night   Thanks you Bella for your service and good food."}
{"text":"A small Italian restaurant, decent and reasonable priced home made meat lasagna ($15) and tiramisu ($5.95).  The place was busy and they take reservation.    They have pizza and gelato as well, but didn't try.  3/5 stars because the restaurant hostess messed up the order for walk-ins.  So if you want to get decent Italian food there, make reservation!"}
{"text":"-Poor Reservation System -Mixed service (poor from management/decent from serving staff) -Food Good  Came here on May 12, heard that they had excellent seafood linguine and it's true! But everything else was poorly done. We had a reservation, but had to wait another 40 mins, if we didn't confront them they wouldn't have seated us. They gave us the worst seat in the house. A four person table for a party of six, in a dark corner of a separate room right in front of an exit/storage room. They were constantly in and out moving chairs and tables. At one point, someone from management told us they would like to take our already too small table and give us a smaller old dusty desk!!! I'm pulling out the RACE card here!!! Come on! We are asian, but we are not smurfs! Our entire table was speechless because of the ridiculousness of the request. I think we were wondering if we were being punk'd!  Would we have been given that request if we were an Italian family dining there, probably not!  The serving staff on the whole were friendly and felt bad/embarrassed for us and treated us more like human beings. The appetizer came out in decent time, but we had to wait another 40mins for the main dish.   If a restaurant was just all about the food, this place would be okay, but for all other reasons including yes, the RACE card, it is piss poor."}
{"text":"Our friends had gotten my boyfriend and I hooked on going to Ice Cream Patio for a nice plate of pasta whenever we were in the mood for it. Although the service could be stepped up a notch,  overall quality of the dishes are not bad.   As we're individuals with an Italian background, we're very critical of what tastes good and up to our standards. Those standards range from quality, quantity, how the sauce is made, etc.   Take it from someone who knows: this place is good and beats many other establishments in terms of authenticity to tradiItalian traditional Italian meals."}
{"text":"Poor everything. A forgettable experience to say the least. The appetizers were not appetizing and the main course (Pizza) was raw. You can give anyone the right tools, but if they don't have the experience using it, those tools are useless. Definitely need to change a lot at this place. I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's big and loud and parking is impossible unless you have a Smart car that can squeeze between all the SUVs in the parking \"lot\".  Once in, you will find that the food is good, but not outstanding. The pizza sauce is sometimes watery. The desserts are OK, but with Demetres just down the road they face some serious competition. Service is OK, but not great. \"A-OK\" seems to sum it up well enough! If you can deal with the noise and parking hassle then you will have a nice evening there."}
{"text":"This is one of the only places that offers fire oven pizza in Toronto. And it's one of the best pizzas I have had to date.    We ordered the boneless fried chicken strips as an appetizer. The chicken was flavourful and crispy. Then came the pizzas ! We ordered the artichoke ham pizza and a green pepper chicken pizza. The pizzas were around the same size as a small pizza you'd get from chain pizza restaurants. However, the crust was thin and crispy. Would definitely recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Ice Cream Patio since the old location and was looking forward to it with some friends that I had brought with me. I assured them the place is very reputable and have real authentic Italian food. Boy was I wrong...  The fried calamari were rubbery, chewy and tasted like they were frozen. The meat balls were hard to cut open and didn't even taste like meat. Sadly very comparable to Ikea's meatballs. The arancini were mushy & deep fried in oil, with nothing traditional on the inside.  Didn't think it could get worse, but it did with the pizza. The dough was raw and so were some of the toppings like the crunchy mushrooms and under cooked pepperoni. Not to mention the thick slab pieces of prosciutto layered on top of the whole pizza. I really hate posting all this but the person in charged needs to know.   Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Service extremely slow but the food too good!  We went during early lunch time to beat the lunch traffic and order fist. We made a reservation as we were a big group.  If you been to Italy, the service is just like in Italy relaxed and slow. But when it came to food it was worth the wait. I ordered a one of the chicken pizza but got the chicken removed as I eat halal meat. The reason I ordered this pizza as the topping were much better then their vegetarian or sea food option. The pizza included zucchini, red peppers and mushrooms. The pizza was made with love and I loved it.   We also tried their Gelato and it was quite good and yummy. Then to top it all up we got an espresso macchiato shot and it was quite smooth, strong and very nice."}
{"text":"One of the best Pizza places in Vaughan area. Their gellato is really good too! And the service is always friendly and quick. Highly recommend if you want to bring a big group in because they are like pros at taking care of that!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday evening with reservations for a party of 8. The place had a nice ambiance and we were seated quickly. Seems to be a popular place for birthdays so I'd recommend making reservations for the weekend evenings. After we were seated, it took a long time for the waiters to get to us- no menus, waters, or bread basket for 20min. Even after the waitress initially came, the she took a long time to come back with anything. After ordering, the food came back pretty fast and it was delicious! I ordered the eggplant parm and it was amazing! Again, the waitress forgot to bring one of my friend's pizza and we could see that it was already done and sitting there getting cold. So for the service, I'm knocking giving this place a 4/5. They definitely need improvements in that area but otherwise, wonderful food!"}
{"text":"This place's food is laughable at best. I mean what did I expect going to a place called \"Ice Cream Patio\" for dinner? My fault entirely.  The service was brutally slow and you could tell it was run by a bunch of teenagers on summer vacation who just didn't give a rats ass about their jobs. Cool.  To say their risotto tasted like 4am, drunken, stale, chicken fried rice would be an insult to stale chicken fried rice across the land. The sandwiches... ah fuck it. They were bad. Everything was bad. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I have been to Ice Cream Patio on several occasions, both at their old and new location. In fact, my family will often come here for a dinner out because the food is consistently great and there is always something for everyone to eat here (I am a vegetarian and my sister is Gluten Free, Dairy Free, Soy Free...fun free).   The service is a little patchy, I mean they are always very nice, but sometimes they forget to come back to you after awhile, but that's cool, you just sit and chill out for a bit until they return or you can flag someone down.   I always get the same thing - Ottima Pizza - and it has never failed me, though once I did get a Vegetarian Sopressa and that was good too. I always complete my night with a scoop of gelato or an affogato and then I am good to go! My family always enjoys the food here and the other pizzas, pastas, appetizers, and entrees have all received rave reviews by them.   Ice Cream Patio, of course, I will return!"}
{"text":"The radicchio salad had no taste and the cannoli dessert was horrible. The pastry was old and stale and the ricotta filling was tasteless as the cannoli was not completely filled. Usually a great meal but disappointing this time"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, I've tried the margherita pizza, the penne alla vodka, and the tortellini alla panna. I've also tried the hazelnut and the strawberry gelato which are delicious. All three mains were absolutely amazing. Although the service seems to always be slow. I've been here a few times now and the lacking service seems to be consistent. The food comes out fairly quickly and is good quality but everything else requires a lot of patience, even when it's a less busy day. I'm always waiting for my order to be taken for a while, and refills take quite a long time as well. Empty/finished plates have sat at my table for 20 minutes sometimes before someone finally comes and takes them away. Luckily, the food here is so good it makes me want to keep coming back, but it's still unacceptable to be waiting so long for so many basic elements of going to a restaurant. Prices are pretty fair here as well, most pastas and pizzas are around $15 and the portion sizes are great."}
{"text":"If my brother hadn't taken me here I never would have guessed a place called Ice Cream Patio was actually a pretty good Italian restaurant. The stone oven pizza is delicious if a little pricey and the desserts are a real delight."}
{"text":"My three stars are for the food. Service would get 0. Once we ordered we were never attended to once. We realized all tables around us got bread and oil and we didnt. We needed to call over a staff member to get some water and for the bill. Our male server was friendly after he took over the original female server. Unfortunate as we enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Such rude service last night! I got a medium 2-scoop in a cup take out gelato. Instead of it being $4 something like it was a few weeks ago when you order TAKE OUT gelato...it was $6.78. Then the man complained that I was paying with a credit card...so he said he has to charge me $7 flat.  Unbelievable! I have never experienced this there, and it really makes me question if I ever want to go back there."}
{"text":"My Zio (Uncle) wanted to treat his famiglia for his 90th. and chose this place after one of his daughters had her 65th. here last year. After reading the negative reviews, I was worried that it would not be so great. After attending the party, I must say; it is \"Fantastico\". We had a party of 27 and yes, the main gal-server had to be reminded a few times for my cola drink(as warned in one negative review),however she did not mess up anything else, she even said Happy Birthday Dad to my Uncle ! She served him first for every course. The view is fantastic, the service is fantastic, the food is fantastic, when can I come here again? I don't know what each person was charged but I noticed a sign on the door for upcoming Mother's Day, $49 per Adult and less per child. As for this birthday party I attended, my better-half thinks it was way more than $50 per person because we had lots of red/white wine bottles, champagne bottles, mineral water bottles. I don't like squid but everyone who tried it loved it. Believe me the squid looked so good, I almost tried it. If you can't finish any serving, ask to take it home, they quickly had that particular serving I could not finish (the veggies) packed in a container and bag, pronto! I was apprehensive when the tables were lined in a vertical row and thought the end person would be stuck against the wall--no way, anyone could easily get out of their chair and get up to go get ice-cream at any time, etc. The end person could easily get up and not have to hit the others sitting down in/on that side against the windows. As for parking, I dunno who said there is no space, I even got a front spot, no problem. We had almost everything, we never did try their pizza but a celebrity Italian singer came in to pick-up pizza he ordered and we asked to sing happy birthday to my Uncle and he did. What can I say but when is the next party at; ice-cream patio in Woodbridge....save me a spot.    --Update as of today; Nov.05.2016 the Zio mentioned above had his burial this past Nov.03rd. Most of the photos shown in the funeral home were taken at this location above. I still remember, singer Vinz Derosa popping in to pick-up boxes of pizza and was asked to come on over and sing Happy Birthday for my Zio to which he did !!~I still remember my Zio posing for photos at this place that he loved so much after visiting it on his daughter's birthday party that he wanted us all to be here on his 90th. and treated us all at; Ice Cream Patio !!"}
{"text":"Popped in tonight for Savour York region and I gotta tell ya...it was far better than I expected. After making reservations earlier in the week, 7 of us ventured down for a $25, three course meal. The good: 1) portion size was not reduced for Savour York Region like other places do 2) my salad was excellent...greens with dried cranberries, pecans, goat cheese and raspberry vinegrette. It was huge and fantastic 3) those that had the steak said it was excellent...portion size was enormous. It came with Rapini, gravey and mashed potatoes 4) my penne a la vodka was ginormous and very flavourful. Couldn't finish it all. 5) gelato was excellent 6) our female server was friendly, efficient and engaging. 7) bottle of wine was the same Pinot we were drinking before we left to come here  The bad: 1) it was very noisy..... 2) gravey for steak was VERY salty 3) by the time it came to dessert, gelato choices were at a minimum (I think they had only 3 different flavours left) 4) Cannolli was dry (Sicilian style)   Here's the best part...when leaving we discussed whether we would return....all agreed we would."}
{"text":"So a girlfriend and I went here last week because we were craving pizza. First google maps brought us to the old location so it took us a little longer to find the place.  We started with the caprese salad. The tomatoes were thickly cut. Now for me I like consistency and it really bothered me that it wasn't. Also the pesto was a little harder to find because of the giant pile of greens they placed in the middle.  We also ordered the gnocchi and an arugula pizza. These we great to the taste. I would have to add that chilli paste they serve with the bread is amazing.   Service was rather slow at the start, it took a while for us to be asked if we wanted anything to drink. By that time we already knew what we wanted to order."}
{"text":"Food was great, server was amazing even though we were just a party of 2 and he was simultaneously handling a family of 12, celebrating a Birthday.  Ordered the Patio Grigliata, even the vegetables and mashed potatoes were cooked to perfection. Wasn't too much of a fan of the pasta in the Chicken Parmesan, but the chicken itself was really good. The Nutella spread with bananas on the dessert pizza was deelish and their Bacio ice cream made in store was to die for!!!   My overall impression of the place was fabulous mainly because of the service we received and their authenticity of flavours (minus the pasta)  My only suggestion if you're planning on visiting is to visit in the afternoons over the weekend because I've passed by this place a few times in the evening and they're generally packed with a huge line-up, which could change your experience of this place. You will get better service and food quality when they're not as rushed and overwhelmed with the crowds."}
{"text":"Ice Cream Patio Ltd. should not be call Ice Cream patio.. as there are really limited choices in gelato selections.. around 8.. and the patio itself is really small facing the parking lot... not my type of patio! :)   The restaurant was empty with just 2 table occupied.. I just want some ice cream and a cappuccino.. I didn't feel to welcome as the waiter reluctantly gave in on my request of having my scoop and coffee served in proper dishware!   My bill was put on my table the same time when my food was served...   Gelato di nocciola ($3)  - Since I love hazelnut, Nocciola is always my default gelato of choice. Especially here where the choice is so limited  - nice and creamy and full of flavour without being way too sweet   Cappuccino ($4)  - surprising smooth and tasty.... and the milk was nicely frothed!   Ice Cream Patio also serves pizza in their wood burning stove... and other traditional pasta and meat dishes...   I might come back for their food.. but I don't know if I can stand the indifference attitude of the wait staffs! Maybe I should have been used to it from my share of experience with Chinese establishments!"}
