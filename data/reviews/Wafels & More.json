{"text":"Amazing waffles, I tried the tutti frutti and I added maple and ice cream. One of the best I've tried!

The place is very chilled out and has a nice design overall, workers are nice."}
{"text":"Definitely the best waffles around! They are made out of dough not batter. I had the Canadian waffle which has vanilla ice cream and maple syrup. My husband had the bananas and chocolate waffle. We both clean our plates which is a rarity. Must try! Soooooo good!"}
{"text":"That's too bad. I forget to take a picture of my banana waffle. I ordered banana waffle and it was so good. The waffle came with cream, chocolate, and bananas. It was not too sweet and it was just right. The place was cozy and spacious. They had comfortable size tables and seats. I did not feel like I was in Kensinton Market. The service was good. The girl who worked at the counter was friendly, but not over friendly. She was very pleasant and kind. I really liked the place. I will come back there soon again."}
{"text":"Had planned to come here for dessert after work to celebrate a recent milestone and ensured that I double checked multiple times to make sure they were open. Was very disappointed to find that, at 4:30 pm on a Monday, they had closed their doors with no explanation and a sign showing very clearly they were supposed to be open until 630.

While I understand things happen and circumstances change, please make changes to reflect truly the hours so customers don't have to trek in the cold and walk away disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice place for original Belgian waffles at the heart of Kensington market ! The owner is Belgian and makes excellent wafels. You may choose between the salty or sweet ones and you can even build your own ! I tried the banana one with Belgian chocolate and it was delicious. I definitely want to come back to try some more ! Also they have speculoos. Definitely a place to go to for dessert ou just a snack."}
{"text":"These waffles are so freakin good, I feel like the toppings are just extra. The waffles itself are delicious and with actual flavour unlike other places I've been too. 

I highly recommend this place, good prices and with a chill atmosphere"}
{"text":"If you've ever had a Belgian waffle in Brussels or anywhere in Belgium, you know how amazing they are. This place is the real deal!! Perfection. The owner was so sweet and is from Brussels himself - definitely knows what he's doing with his homemade batter. The sweet waffle tastes JUST like being on the street in Brussels! Amazing!! Definitely get the sweet version (not the savory) if you're looking for authentic."}
{"text":"Its a real Belgian Liege Waffle made with proper Pearl Sugar

The Decor is lovely -- beautiful, cute, great for dates and even casual hangout. They have a nice Patio as well where you can see them make the waffle, etc. 

I had the generic wafel with chocolate/banana topping -- sadly could taste too much banana -- however, gonna go again and try other things."}
{"text":"Great waffles, amazing service - what else can you ask for?! We were completely drawn to this shop, enraptured by the warm, sweet, sugary smells wafting from the waffle makers. My dad and sister entered the place, and got one waffle each. My dad ordered the Banana while my sister created her own custom Brussels waffle.

The waitress serving us was so friendly and kind! The shop does both grab and go, and sit-in, but it's quite casual and you pay at the counter before sitting. We sat in the backyard patio for a bit, where the outside view was very quaint and enjoyable, and then shifted inside. When we were served by the waitress, she gave us extra cutlery sets to share (since we only had two waffles but four people) and reminded us that there was free water at the counter if we were thirsty and wanted anything to drink.

Banana:
This Brussels waffle (sweetened with sugar pearls) came topped with bananas, whipped cream, and Belgian chocolate. The dish was great, but far too sugary. I did enjoy the buttery and sweet waffle base, but would prefer if the chocolate was dark chocolate instead! 

Custom Liege Waffle:
My sister got the Liege waffle topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream ($2) and whipped cream ($1). The Liege kind is much crispier and drier, but provides a great base to carry the sweet flavours. I can't imagine how this would taste savoury! Must be equally as delicious too. The cold, slightly melted ice cream paired with the warm waffle was a complete dream!"}
{"text":"Visited Kensington market on a Friday afternoon... 

Service: everyone was very nice & helpful!

Ambiance: semi casual & cute! Bathrooms are in the back. They have water you pour yourself. 

Food: $$$ $9.09 for leige waffle + strawberries + tip. 

got the leige belgian waffle with fresh strawberries. As far as beligan waffles go, we were a bit disappointed by the flavor profile. Not really sure where the hype comes from. Not filling at all and tasted like a regular waffle.

Wouldn't recommend as there are many other excellent eats in the area."}
{"text":"Since I've been back from Brussels, nothing has compared to an authentic Belgian waffle. Those who have been can vouch for this, I'd dare say it's my favourite thing I've put in my mouth, and just trust me in that said recommendation is quite glowing. 

I went to this establishment yesterday and met one of the men who is behind it, and it turns out he is from Belgium, imports everything, and does a good job. I'm gonna get fat(ter) and I don't care. Sometimes some of my surburban and rural friends ask what the appeal to living in a big city is, and part of that is being able to travel to Belgium in a 4 minute walk.

This will be my go-to personal treat reward place from now on, I can feel it."}
{"text":"A little bit overpriced. The waffle was average. The atmosphere was quiet and clean."}
{"text":"Folks we have winner on our hand here. Those of you who have been looking for Liege style waffles this is the place that does it right IMO. I personally prefer Liege over Brussels style of waffles so my review is biased. Most of the waffles I have tried in North America were missing the crunch on the edges and weren't dense or chewy enough (lack of pearl sugar in the batter)
I tried the banana with chocolate version on this trip. I can assure you I will be back to try other versions soon as they were quite good and hit all the check marks that make a great Liege waffle i.e denser, chewier, sweeter and most importantly richer."}
{"text":"Definitely overpriced, but pretty the waffle was tasty. I ordered the fruit topped and it was great, but it came with no syrup. I had to ask for her to bring some over, which she did but could not leave at the table because it's the only saueeze bottle they had, which I think is odd for a place that specializes in waffles.
My americano was yummy but tiny and didn't come until after my waffle had been served, which I also found odd. 
The space is small and fills up quick. I had planned to work at my table but felt guitly given the line that was forming. I guess it's not really a good place to enjoy coffee and work. It's more of a gentrified fancy breakfast place or at least it's trying to be..."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for liege waffles, especially if they are done to perfection. While we were on the patio enjoying one of these perfectly made waffles, the people next to us had shakes that looked beyond amazing. The next day, we popped in and opted for a strawberry shake. Fresh strawberries were blended in topped with unsweetened whipping cream - unreal! Makes my mouth water thinking about it and this is not to take away from how good the waffles were, if that says anything!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best dessert place that you can ever try. Belgian atmosphere with the pictures of the queen and the king, and delicious waffles authentically made by a great chef. Never miss it when you're walking around the Kensington market."}
{"text":"Love the waffles! So much variety in sweet and savoury waffles, and not just your standard Nutella strawberry kind. Specullous bomb is a must try!"}
{"text":"I had the sweet Dame Blanche Wafel with added fresh strawberries.  The Wafels were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The ice cream was decadent.  I would return to try more of their delicious dessert Wafels."}
{"text":"These are not actual Belgian waffles - no trace of leige sugar and very soft waffles. They're okay and fairly good for standard waffles but I doubt that the owners of this place could find Belgium on a map."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend after dinner, and it's definitely my new favourite go-to for waffles! A cozy place tucked away in kensington- there was just one person running the place when I was there but the food arrived promptly and tasted absolutely fantastic. Great place to catch up with friends (and to get a waffle or two for the road home)."}
{"text":"SUCH. GOOD. WAFFLES. Found this gem on Yelp while searching for lunch in Kensington market. My boyfriend and I split the sweet Canadian waffle and savory French waffle. Definitely recommend trying one from each category. The inside was also so cute, and they make the waffles right up front. Great place to stop for a quick meal or snack."}
{"text":"wow. Everythinghere is exemplary. The waffles reminded me of being in Europe last year!!!. My new goto place when Im in Toronto"}
{"text":"This is the true flavour of the Belgium traditional waffles, fresh, tasty and well presented, the speculoos bomb is the best, i always come back to this place, i've tried another establishments based on yelp reviews but seriously people... nothing compare to wafels and more. This is a must!"}
{"text":"The only thing better than waffles is Belgian waffles. The smell alone is to die for. They have sweet and savoury options so even if you don't like sweets, you should at least try their savoury waffles. The yeast-based dough give the waffle a nice bread-like texture. Who doesn't love bread?? 

I got the speculoos bomb because you can't go wrong with the cookie butter and vanilla ice cream pairing on top of a warm waffle. I'll be sure to come back and try some of their other waffles."}
{"text":"The savoury and the sweet waffles are both to die for ! So delicious and made fresh right in front of you! This place is delicious I highly recommend"}
{"text":"In the heart of Kensington market. Belgian waffles and more serves fantastic and unique waffles. The owner is very nice and down to earth. The experience of eating here reminds me if I was in Europe. I would definitely recommend checking this place out. Will return again."}
{"text":"I added better comments in my check in here, oops. Long story short, if you are in Toronto looking for a brunch place... Wafels & More needs to be on your list. Towards the top. Number 1 spot, just come here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The location is perfect. Kensington market!!!!! The restaurant is not too small but it wasn't huge, clean, atmosphere was really warm and friendly. I was greeted by one staff member who I think did like everything, he was like the only staff I saw! Talk about superman. He was making the food, tending to customers friendly and cleaning! Amazing! 

What my friend and I ordered was:

Bresilliénne: Vanilla ice cream, caramel, peanuts and whipped cream

Speculoos bomb:
Vanilla ice cream, speculoos cookie butter and whipped cream

Both with Liege style waffles. Soft, sweet and chewy waffle made with authentic Belgium sugar pearls.

Lactose intolerant people... I am warning you! Your stomach won't like you but your taste buds will praise you!!!!!! Damn the waffles are HEAVENLY!!!!! Light and fluffy and sweet and urgh just pure heavenly. I took my first bite and I was blown away. The whipped cream.... omg... not overly sweet but not bland! It was perfect! So delicious I could eat a tub. I believe everything is homemade like the waffles and Ice cream even the whipped cream which I don't doubt. You can tell the difference. The ice cream is so creamy, It was just vanilla flavour but the flavour popped. 

These waffles are drool worthy."}
{"text":"Wafels and More doesn't mean Wafels...and eggs, sausage, bacon, and other foods. It's just waffles here!

I recommend the Canadian with strawberries. Comes with ice cream! 

The serving I got was on the smaller side. Don't expect to chow down on a giant waffle breakfast here."}
{"text":"A cute dessert spot in Kensington dedicated to freshly-made waffles only. Both savoury and sweet options.

Ordered a custom combination of Liege waffle + Nutella + ice cream and it was decadent :)

Plain waffle is $4 with toppings costing $1-2 each."}
{"text":"The portions are deceptively large. The food is rich, maybe don't plan any big activity after going here (maybe a nap instead...). Clean, fast, good service, and tasty."}
{"text":"Awesome Brussels waffle. Light and fluffy on the inside with a crisp exterior that crunches under your fork. Had my waffle with sliced strawberries, chocolate drizzle, and whipped cream. For the price, I would have liked a larger waffle with more strawberries, but the waffle itself was melt-in-your-mouth. Can't wait to come back and try a savoury waffle.

The interior is clean, bright, and comfortable, with lots of framed images on the wall showing off Belgium."}
{"text":"Great location in Kensington and good waffles. 
I got the Banana waffle with ice cream ($9.50 plus tax-  3 stars) and an americano ($3.00 plus tax - 3 stars). Overall quality the food was alright. The wait for the food was on the longer side but still within reason and they have a nice patio."}
{"text":"Lovely place, yummy, giant waffles, cozy patio, and beautiful backyard! If you are wandering in Kensington market and crave for something sweet, this place is the best! Be aware that waffles come in big portions, and one is usually so enough for two normal eating people!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic little restaurant in Kensington and I would highly recommend it to all the waffle lovers out there.  It was lunchtime so business was brisk with a lot of customers coming through and only one person working!  Now this young lady was beyond belief, so friendly, helpful and talk about efficient taking orders, making the food, delivering the food AND busing tables.  Whatever they are paying this gal, it is not enough.  We shared a sweet and a savory waffle and they were both delicious!  The sweet waffle makes a perfect dessert.  The waffle itself is a Liege waffle which is dense and a little chewey and the perfect base for chocolate and whipped cream.  The savory waffle is a Brussels waffle and is different in that it was light and crisp and we had the Italian with proscuitto, mozarella, fresh tomato and basil.  The restaurant has a nice big seating with outdoor seating on the back patio as well as tables out front for people watching."}
{"text":"Well worth the visit and price (especially with the current exchange rate!), this place serves up carefully constructed waffles with savoury and sweet toppings. You can also build your own and pay a set amount for each topping you choose, but we decided on the Italian savoury waffle and a Brussels waffle dipped in Belgian chocolate.

++
Italian: cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, and prosciutto on a sizeable rectangular liege waffle. The waffle was more crumbly than chewy, and definitely more delicate than expected. The balsamic type of dressing worked, and the whole thing was made with careful attention to detail. 

Brussels waffle dipped in Belgian chocolate: this waffle was different to liege waffle in size, shape, texture, and flavour, and was certainly more chewy as well. It was piping hot, and a perfect complement to the savoury goodness that was the savoury waffle.

Service was quick, friendly, and overall drama free, and the ambience was light and casual. 

- -
Plenty of seating both inside and on the outdoor patio, but beware the sluggish wifi on the patio - we eventually had to move inside, although I still couldn't connect to wifi anyway

I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"As I've been to Belgium many times, I'm biased :) 

But I must admit that this place has pretty damn good waffles. I got the banana with Belgian chocolate. It was very good. 

I would recommend this place anytime."}
{"text":"I love waffles, especially liege waffles! My husband and I were walking around the area and accidentally found this place. I ordered the specialty Cupido, it's a liege waffle with strawberries, Nutella and whipped cream. If I had not had an ice cream dessert right before this I would have gotten something with ice cream. If you don't like Nutella you can opt for Belgian chocolate. Overall, generous portion, good service, clean store and ample space to hang out. 

We stopped by late afternoon around 4pm. The wait time was amazingly short! Our waffle came out hot and fresh in about 5 minutes. 

The store decor is quirky but I loved it! The sit down area is open and lots of space. You won't feel crammed if you come with a group. The space is clean and has a gender neutral bathroom."}
{"text":"Other than a lack of sleep and too many dreary February days in a row, I don't know what possessed me to have a waffle for lunch.

I had intended to visit this place anyway, so I figured, \"why not?\"

I chose the lighter (less dense) waffle and had it covered with bananas, chocolate and cream.  It looked like a piece of art.

It was the best waffle I have ever had.

For 9$ all in, the banana waffle would be a perfect breakfast or a shared dessert for 2.

They also have several other sweet, as well as savoury options.

Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Deliciousness!!! I was mad that I couldn't eat a full breakfast here with eggs and bacon! The wafel was perfect as a dessert or something to warm you up on a cold day. Would recommend Wafels & More!!!"}
{"text":"Got the banana and belgian chocolate.   Very delicious.  The waffle was a a bit crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.   Wish it was a little bigger."}
{"text":"From the first taste of the waffles to the last bite, each square was tender, flavourful and turned out perfectly. Christophe, the shop owner explained that the yeast in these traditional Belgian waffles make for exceptionally deep pockets, perfect for capturing all the fresh toppings. FINALLY a recipe worthy of a five star rating!"}
{"text":"The liege waffles here are tasty and delicious. They offer plain ones (which you can get heated up), mini ones, or ones with tonnes of toppings. They gave premade creations or you can make your own. I only tried the mini liege waffle. 

Service was really good. Very friendly. 

They serve coffee as well. The Americano was very good. 

Plenty of seating inside. They have a Belgian radio station playing as well to add to the whole feel of the place. 

Great place for dessert or a quick bite. They offer savoury waffles as well, which I'll be back to try if I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"Moved to the Kensington area about nine months ago. Been coming her almost regularly since we moved in. They opened I think in Nov 2016 and we wanted them to last, so our thoughts were to come in as much as we could to support that. :P 
Their waffles are the best! 
Since I tried the Nordic (salmon, cream cheese, capers, balsamic drizzle) that's my go to! 
My fiancé always gets the Cupido (strawberries, whipped cream, Belgium chocolate drizzle) with banana! 

The owner and employees are awesome! The owners always watch before the waffles go out to make sure they are perfect. 

Oh and WHEN you go get their coffee. It's delicious. We always go for the Americano. :)"}
{"text":"A 3.5 ***'
A decent dessert option in the Kensington area. I had the Nordic (smoked salmon, capers, cream cheese) and the Tutti Frutti waffles. The man working the cash register and the waffle griddles by himself is quite efficient and friendly. The waffles themselves weren't bad, but weren't exceptional. The nordic: there wasn't enough salmon to balance the amount of waffle (which was pleasantly dense). The dessert waffle struck a good balance of a decent helping of sliced fruit on their leige waffles. I'm likely to give this place another shot as I feel it has more to offer than I've been able to outline thus far."}
{"text":"Wafels & More is a classy and inviting dessert café in the heart of Kensington Market that specializes in authentic Belgian waffles. The moment you walk in, you get the sense that the owner is definitely of Belgian origin and has imported the goodness to this side of the world for us Torontonians to enjoy.

The texture and appearance of the waffles made here are enough to satisfy me alone. Each bite is partially crispy but also perfectly soft and chewy on the inside. I can't imagine these delicious treats having a hard time going with any of the many toppings offered.

I'll definitely be back, as I found the the 'speculoos' topping very intriguing. It's made from crushed gingerbread cookies, which is unlike anything I've every had. Ice cream and some chocolate or caramel drizzle seems like the next logical thing to sample here. Check 'em out, the owner is very nice and helpful. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert with the kids, the food/dessert was delicious and the owner was very nice.  Great spot to grab one of their outdoor tables and take in the scene."}
{"text":"Visiting from Southern California and stumbled across this cute Belgium Waffle coffee shop. The owner Christophe is very nice and he moved here from Belgium! The Belgium waffles here are freshly made on the spot and taste really good. Both sweet and savory options. They serve Illy coffee here and have some comfy booths seating. I had the Liege waffle and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"So, I have a confession to make: I don't really like waffles.

I know. I'm some sort of freak. I'm sorry.

But this place is still really excellent. They have a wide enough waffle selection (and some killer drinks) that even the weirdest, most waffle hating person can find something they'll enjoy.

Plus, it's just so Instagrammable."}
{"text":"Christophe is an authentic (not fake) Belgian that has brought his immense talents as a master waffler overseas from the motherland of Belgian waffles, Belgium. When you walk past his shop you don't think much of exterior but like those old cartoons where an imaginary smell hits your nose and you lose your mind, you must come in and pay it a visit (especially when your pregnant wife tells you that she wants to.) 

Anyways the waffles are as good as they smell. Dude makes the waffle batter himself daily.  We got a basic waffle and if it weren't for my mothers voice telling me not to spoil dinner I would get another one but with chocolate glazed over it with sprinkles and a scoop of ice cream to top. Ok no more. Writing this is making me hungry."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located right in the perfect area for food. I ordered the Banana and my boyfriend ordered the Cookies and Cream. It was both delicious! We devoured it and decided we wanted to try one of the savory waffles. So, we got the Italian and that was wonderful as well. I would definitely recommend for anyone who wants a piece of Belgium in Toronto!"}
{"text":"So yummy! Quick service as well. My waffle could have used a little more biscoff, but it was definitely well made and still seriously delicious."}
{"text":"We all really liked the waffles but we ordered delivery and they didn't give us any napkins or silverware. We had to go to the lobby to ask for some. The waffles were kind of small so it wasn't very filling. I think we needed to order more to fill us up but that would've been really expensive."}
{"text":"So I paid $6.5 for this waffle and it was good, but I definitely wont be going back especially at that price point. 

First off, I got Belgian chocolate for an extra $1.5 and she just drizzles the waffle with it ! Not even a nice coating at all :( Too be honest, I barely tasted the chocolate. 

My second complaint was the lack of caramelization. As a disclaimer, I am not Belgian but I have been Belgium a couple times, and Liege waffles usually have a nice caramelized outside coating and a nice crunch when you hit those pearled sugar crystals. I  got none of that. It tasted like a normal waffle to me. 

I have certainly experienced better!"}
