{"text":"I know it's quick food, but smile a little bit. A & W is is next door and they are very polite. Having said that the food is passable. I would go for the samosas as they seem to put most focus on them."}
{"text":"There's so many great places to eat along the Red Mile. Pizza Boys Shawarma isn't a restaurant that belongs on the must-dine list. You aren't going to come here with a date or bring a few friends here for dinner. Instead, this small store front is dedicated to those who want a quick snack (or meal) possibly after a few drinks. It's not a sit down restaurant, rather a walk up to the counter, order and get your food in three minutes kind of a place.   How the heck did we end up here? It wasn't planned. That I can promise. We'd already eaten at Big Cheese Poutinerie and one of my friends had talked about how he didn't know what shawarma was while we walked back to the car. Having only eating some of our poutine (it was just fair) we opted for round two and search for a place with hummus and shawarma. We walked three blocks and stumbled upon this place. From the outside it sure isn't modern and is in desperate need of a makeover.   Meanwhile, seeing as we were only going to split a sandwich we went in. The family that runs this place is nice, helpful and passionate about what they cook. While the pizza looked like something from a gas station. I wouldn't eat it. On the other hand, there shawarma was fine. It's not the best you've ever had, but a fair priced average tasting entree. The hummus is average, too.   Why come here? I'm not sure. With the number of other restaurants nearby this is one of the last place I'd end up. There's too many other better tasting, more enticing and more upbeat spots around. However, if it's a quick bite you're after - this might be the average spot you were looking for."}
{"text":"By far the worst shawarma i ever Had. Wasn't even shawarma I think they added curry to it. Not sure if that's even legal. The fries tasted good. So did the diet coke. Just the shawarma is not to be eaten."}
{"text":"Ordered online.  Food arrived cold.  Poutine would have been good except way too much oxo (beef bullion) so not edible.  Donair, again would have been good if not cold.  Overall, not a good experience and would not try again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a bitter man (owner?) to serve you some over-priced, albeit quick eats, without making eye contact, this is the place for you!  These days, when businesses are struggling to stay open, it amazes me that people are still clueless when it comes to basic customer service."}
{"text":"I've had better donairs before, nothing special here.  The service was good, the staff was friendly.  Again, the taste of the donair meat itself was sub par and a bit on the expensive side for what you get.  The pizza was also a bit dry."}
