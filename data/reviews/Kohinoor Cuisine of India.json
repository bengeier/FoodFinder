{"text":"This family-owned gem is fantastic! Everything was delicious, especially the lamb korma. Everything I ate was a different experience. It has the feeling of eating at a friend's house, but only the kind of friend who is a great host. The owners are extremely welcoming. For newcomers to Indian cuisine, the owners were very helpful in explaining how best to compliment what dish with which sauce and explain the overall Indian cuisine experience. You can really taste the love in every bite."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! It's a little bit awkward at first because they don't really seat you or tell you how their setup works, you just kind of go for it. The price is unreal! I called ahead to ask for pricing and I thought for sure I had misunderstood. The restaurant was clean, and you could tell it was family owned. Everyone was very kind and attentive, they knew that we hadn't eaten there before because they didn't recognize us. They brought us one of each of their deserts for free, such a sweet gesture. The food was really wonderful, I wish I had a bigger stomach. They have a great variety and a few things I hadn't heard of before, along with the staples that no good Indian restaurant can go without. The man who was refilling everyone's water was hilarious. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"One place which has buffet during dinner. This place is super close to ASU campus. It has a good variety of options. I usually choose the non-veg options especially the spicier ones. Attractions: samosas, bhajjis, chicken, mutton, dal makhani."}
{"text":"Love this local Tempe favorite. Affordable great quality Indian food. It's not fine dining it's just great food, great prices and a rare night time Indian buffet! This restaurant has been around longer than most Tempe residents and for good reason. The owners are very friendly. My favorites were the eggplant, the spinach and the chicken tikka masala!"}
{"text":"GROUPON SCAM PLEASE READ:  UPDATE 11/9/2013 YELP deleted my photo of the container of chicken tikka masala next to a can of coke. The picture shows the size of the container, smaller than the size of a coke. This was my order, my experience so YELP is being an ass to remove my photo.   On to the review:  This place was a total SHAM. We bought the $25 for $12 take out Groupon. We showed up and asked for a menu (no menu from Kohinoor online, not even on their Facebook. SCAM) , they said they had no menu, WHAT? After asking a couple times the owner said to someone else \"get the menu\" and cocked his head. They managed to come up with a ridiculously priced menu after being there for 10 minutes. $12.99 for chicken tikka masala with no rice or naan. The Biltmore doesn't even charge these prices.  We are a regular of Curry Corner literally a stones throw away and the owner starts talking crap about Curry Corner. At CC you get the tikka masala, rice AND add garlic naan for $10.   Anyway you don't eat chicken tikka masala without rice or naan (and no other restaurant we have ever been to HASN'T offered it) so my husband ordered this for me (it came to $20 here!!!!!) and his Lamb Biryani ($12.99). When the food comes and the owner shows my husband the food my husband is shocked SHOCKED he is charging $12.99 for what CC charges $8, then the owner tells my husband that CC sells a smaller size, that my husband could go to CC right now if he didn't believe him. WHAT!!!! We eat there once a week! I get the same thing @ CC and we would know what size they give us!  My husband is Arab and is talking to the owner who is totally swindling my husband. He gives my husband a small mango yogurt drink and then he goes on to tell us that if we stop going to CC and go to his restaurant that he would sell us the buffet for $8.99 and our kids would eat free (they are 26 months and 9 months).  Then he takes my husband next door to the store to show him the halal meat (is this when they put the buffet food in the take out containers or take the buffet food to the back and make chicken tikka masala and biryani out of the buffet spread? No proof but I wouldn't doubt this).  So my husband said ok, he paid for our food difference $8 and left. When we got home, his biryani was BEEF not lamb. There was no mix up, we were the only ones in the restaurant, and my husband was talking to the owner the entire time.  This was a HORRIBLE Groupon experience, and a total scam, offering a take out Groupon for $12 for $25 worth of food and then offering ridiculous prices and claiming they don't have a menu. BY THE WAY they have a lunch buffet for $6.99 and dinner for $9.99 WITH CTM, samosas, rice, naan etc, so prey tell me how they are selling chicken tikka masala TO GO for $12.99 with no rice or naan?  My husband threw out his biryani the beef was inedible (chewy and old, the dish was room temperature) and then he ended up eating leftover bbq pulled chicken sandwich that I made yesterday. I took pictures of my CTM and the container is smaller than the size of a can of coke. CTM was room temperature (it should have been HOT) edible, not good, but not bad  but I wouldn't go back if it was even $5.  In the real world we pretty much got $10 worth of food (inedible BEEF biryani) and we paid $20."}
{"text":"My old skydiving pal Karin introduced me to this place years ago.  Outstanding then, outstanding now.  The decor has improved over the years, and now they have a really great buffet at lunch and dinner. Used to be a young girl sitting at a table doing her homework . . . now she's at medical school and her parents, who own and run this place must be very proud.  I know I'm proud to have supported them all these years, and they certainly have enriched my life with their wonderful food and friendly hospitality."}
{"text":"I love spicy food and they did not disappoint. Food was very spicy and tasty. The owner is very friendly and explained all of the different foods to us."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of its kind.The food served in the restaurant is very delicious and fresh.I love their samosas ,garlic naaan and all the curries(paneer,bhindi,channa,palak).It makes me feel like being in India. The owners of the restaurant and the people working are very friendly .The chat and mango lassi are very very tasty.I have been to this restaurant many times in the last few months.Every visit is better than before..I highly recommend this restaurant to all the people who are looking forward to authentic Indian food ."}
{"text":"Pathetic place, worst food. I tried vegetarian food for dinner buffet and it was no where close to average food. Decided never to visit this place again."}
{"text":"Love the buffet.. never seen these many veggie options in buffet.they also have 5-6 varieties of sweets. There is always some kind of deal and prices are extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"Wonderful, friendly service and excellent buffet!  They have a dinner buffet as well, which is a pleasant surprise since most Indian restaurants only have lunch buffets.  Authentic and homemade, food is great!!! And, best Naan bread . Open holidays too!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place place the service is amazing I feel like I'm eating dinner at a friend's house the paneer......amazing the naan...to die for my name is Josh and I approve this place best Indian place in town hands down"}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful, its authentic delicious Indian cuisine. I've been visiting this place for years now and I can still find plenty of reasons to go back. And it keeps getting better; they started serving Indian beers and since they made the buffet available pretty much all the time, its been better than ever :) Ive taken many friends and family to eat here and they all love it too! the owners are also lovely people. All around great experience. also.. the naan is amazing, you're almost guaranteed to have more than one basket!"}
{"text":"It is pathetic place.   I found hair in their sweets but owner was not surprised and just remove the hair and left sweets for other to eat.   All food was stale. Had stomach issue the other day.  Never ever go there if you like to eat hygienic food."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area from San Diego and found a deal on living social. The majority of the dishes were WAY to spicy (and I love spicy food) and the naan which I thought was included in the buffet was soggy. When I told the cashier he couldn't of cared less he just wanted my credit card. Most of the good reviews must be local students who don't know any better and no other options are close. Won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"Inside this unassuming storefront you'll find a gem of an Indian restaurant. The buffet selections are plentiful, fresh and flavorful. I sampled samosas, tandoori chicken, eggplant, chicken tiki masala and assorted rice offerings. The naan is hot, well-seasoned and apparently endless as the server kept offering more  throughout the meal. Speaking of servers, they are friendly, courteous and efficient. This place is a keeper!"}
{"text":"I live across the street and can't eat here any more.  I went in once for lunch to go and the one of the curries melted through it's container and one to my car seat.  The other ones were lacking in salt and spice- very much boxed versions....no love in the food.  I too experienced the crunchy rice.  What turned me off completely was that my bf and i went in once to pick up some sweets and there was a nice american lady ahead of us in line that had ordered the same thing that we were going to, and the owner quoted us a different price that what he quoted her!!! Epic fail."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We eat here at least once a week when our indian food craving hits. No better buffet in town! All you can eat na'an! Check it out."}
{"text":"Great place; location is perfect especially if you're an ASU student.  Price and overall quality of the food is fantastic.  The buffet is always fully stocked and fresh. The restaurant is clean with excellent staff.  The food is absolutely phenomenal; flavor, freshness, quality, & quantity are all to be expected every time you go in.  You can't beat the price, especially for everything you get.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Love love this place! My self control goes out the window when it comes to this place's buffet! Come hungry because you will be stuffed with all the options. The desserts are small, so leave room in your stomach and split it with someone because they are sweet."}
{"text":"Buffet had too many similar choices. Place was not very clean, nor inviting. Signs scolding patrons to not waste food made me feel like the restaurant staff did not want us there. If you are worried about your buffet being wasted by college kids, then change locations, charge more or only offer entrees. Food was ok. Atmosphere- yuck."}
{"text":"Amazing food from an amazing family owned restaurant. Always fresh and delicious. I don't eat much meat, and there are always plenty of vegetarian options. We're always welcomed with a warm greeting and treated as friends. Very thankful for this incredible place!"}
{"text":"My parents went here and reccomended it.  My friend and I were in the neighborhood drunk and starving and decided to give it a try. We thought the food was FABULOUS (from what i remembered, which did include crawling around the table looking for a cigarette i dropped.)  I came back about a month later with the same friend and our roommate. We sat there for awhile before someone came to take our order, and realized that there were half a dozen gallon jugs of milk sitting out on the counter. They remained there for our entire meal, which was pretty disturbing. When the waiter showed up, he was dripping sweat from his chin, and proceeded to sweat on our entres as he brought them. Now personally, I'm not so grossed out by a little sweat that I would ignore a heaping plate of food in front of me. I tried everything that was brought and didn't finish any of it. My friends that I was with were really freaked out by the sweating and the warm milk sitting out and barely touched theirs.  Lesson of all this? If you are going to go to Kohinoor, get drunk. Otherwise, go to Udupe, Pasand, Copper Kettle, or heck, del taco!"}
{"text":"I will seriously recommend this place to everyone. It is one of the good place to eat India food. Best is the owner of this place who takes care of everyone with full warmth. Definitely try papdi chaat & lassi which is a part of buffet. I definitely say these two items are worth the price of the whole buffet and rest of things look complimentary. The ambience & outlook is simple but who cares about that we want good food and thats what you will get once you go to this place. There is no harm for trying it once and don't forget to order papdi chaat and sweet mango lassi."}
{"text":"Don't listen to the bad reviews, the food is excellent, service is spot on, and prices are cheap. Best Indian food in Tempe no doubt."}
{"text":"It's been almost 4 years since my initial review, but Kohinoor remains our favorite restaurant. Sadly, we live about 30min away now but we still make the trip a couple times per month. I don't know how they do it for the price they do, but the food is amazing. Quality can depend on time of day and it is usually a little better earlier in the day or right around the dinner rush (as with most buffets, probably). One note: the food here is SALTY. I personally love it, but could understand if that's not your thing."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, great variety of vegetarian and authentic desserts. The owners and staff are always very friendly. We always have a great experience .The Mango Lasse is the best. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good food. Value for money. Service is great and the selection of food is just right."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place! We drive from north phoenix just to eat here. Everything they make is so delicious! I hope they never change a thing."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Great price at only $8 for all you can eat lunch buffet. The garlic naan bread is delicious and the chicken korma is to die for. This place is seriously a hidden gem in Tempe."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all cost. The cashier was all smiles until we showed him our Groupon. His demenior then changed and he started to become very angry. He said that we should have shown him the Groupon when we first entered the restaurant (Which makes zero sense). He then angrily told us that we had to purchase an additoinal food time. He randominaly charged me $6. More importantly, the food was horrible. Rude service and bad food... you have been warned."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian Food in Phoenix my friends. Their menu is great, but I always load up at the buffet. Their shai paneer, palk sag, and channa masala are just a few dishes that rule the desert.   If you appreciate authentic Indian cuisine and great service, this is where you get down. You can thank me by treating me to some Kohinoor somosa."}
{"text":"WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS PLACE HAS ANY GOOD REVIEWS! We've had both Groupons and restaurant.com certificates for this restaurant that supposedly cover a certain amount of money, but they always screw you out of money here. They find out you're using a coupon and they turn into assholes, and then they sit there and type extra charges into your bill before allowing you to pay.   We've visited with groupons supposedly good for two buffets and we've been charged ten dollars-we were literally charged for the amount the groupon was supposed to save us plus tax. This time we came in with a buy 15, get 15 restaurant certificate, and the buffet is only 11.95 per person, so we asked for 3 teas to go and said we'd pay the extra dollar & all tax(teas are supposed to be two dollars each), but they wouldn't give us any AND they charged us extra cash. This place has no honor or integrity. I love indian food but frequent this place the least out of the whole east valley. You'd practically save money going anywhere else, since no other local indian restaurant appears to be run by ragey, bold-faced liars. 17+ dollar per person buffet? ????  Regarding the service:  When you're seated, here, they pour you some moldy water and leave. They don't take the extra place settings from your table so you're sitting there nervously trying to not touch the extra folded napkins on the table because you KNOW they're going to just leave them for the next customers which makes YOU feel responsible for THEIR customer service-as if it's the job of one of their customers to not ruin the evening of whatever group next uses the same dirty table. Watched a customer there use another folded napkin at their table to prop up their cell phone to read something and then that napkin was used by the next guest to be seated. Isn't that some sort of germ hazard? Anyway. Three swole college guys came in and they were treated like a huge hassle-the owners lurked over them and whined that they were taking too much each time any of them went back to the buffet. They got no naan. We were given a single naan between the two of us and our water was never refilled-and that was before we even showed them the coupon. After you show them a coupon they become outright hostile every single time.  Another fun fact regarding this place-the first time I went, I lost my wallet inside, and then when I returned in a panic looking for it while multiple adult men sullenly stared at me from behind the counter, they didn't even let me know they HAD it-behind that very counter-that I'd LEFT it ON the counter while paying-until I got a feeling they had it & demanded it. Why would they need to keep my wallet?  My husband wants me to point out that it's hard to even eat 11.95 worth of food when their buffet is too spiced for the indian people eating there, let alone your average ASU student-the amount of heat in their buffet is clearly a measure taken to get people to not eat much. He was up in the middle of the night to eat yogurt from the horrible heartburn it gave us, and we cook curries weekly at home, so I don't even know how people that aren't used to it could possibly handle it. We'd determined in the past that although they are open late into the night, you can't go later because the food just gets more and more hot as it sits. We went late several months ago and he literally formed sores in his mouth WHILE eating it, it was SO overspiced. Not only that but they even keep the only decent dish empty no matter what time of the afternoon or evening you visit, probably to make sure no one can take much of it. This place would barely be worth the groupon's cost-it's not even worth full price considering the service and product. &The desserts(which they're... known for?) are grossly oversweet. Each and every one of them. :( It's hard to balance the spice with the kheer when it's a sugarcube.  I don't usually give bad reviews, i'd like to throw that out there: This place is terrible. I don't like being around people I can't trust or that don't have pride in providing good service or even seeming reasonably logical.  The logic is the ultimate reason for this review. Let's lay out why their behavior is untenable... They both: 1: get nasty as fuck with you: 2: fail to honor their coupons. That's illogical as hell. What makes them think they can do both and still seem like a viable business? Now, don't get me wrong, I know it's not particularly viable to not honor your own coupons. However, they need to choose one or the other... They ought to either: 1: get nasty as fuck with you BECAUSE they are honoring your coupon and are upset about it, or 2: Be extremely courteous about not honoring the coupon. Where in the fucking hell do they get off being rude, while invalidating their reasoning to be rude? That's crazy!  I'm sure it's clear to see that after being to this place several times and always being treated like trash, we are seething."}
{"text":"The buffet is so good.  Everything was delicious great place to go for a quick lunch. Walk in and start eating.   I created a yelp account just to make this review.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant recently and the quality of food they serve keeps increasing. We had a chance to eat fresh and hot food. This place is owned by a family and they are very warm and welcoming. When in doubt just ask them for help.   They have huge discounts for students."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've been looking for a new favorite Indian place in the Valley since my old favorite changed owners and ran into the ground. I'm happy I've finally found it.  Sure, there's always someone wanting something, but I've never seen such a great priced buffet with so many main entrees. There were at least 15-20 main entree options on the buffet. The food was great, the variety made our larger group all happy.  What really made the experience for me was the way the family who runs the place are incredibly attentive and truly want to welcome you and make sure you enjoy the food, as if you were visiting their own home. I was surprised to find they've been here for 26 years, but now that I've found them I won't need to explore very often.  They also were more than accommodating of the Groupon and even told me next time I could use the Living Social deal. I understand that a lot of people don't tip on the full total so Groupon has some stigma for food service employees, but the way they handled it was very much like advertising. They want me to come back, not just extract as much money from me as they can and leave me with a bad taste for the way they run a business.  I will definitely be back, I highly recommend the buffet. I have not tried the menu, but with a lunch and dinner buffet, I really get all I'd ever order and more anyway."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner buffet. Awesome hospitality by uncle. Really good food and desserts. Never experienced such a good  hospitality in bay area.  Will come back here again whenever I'm around in the city."}
{"text":"Kohinoor is a simple buffet with multiple options.  Everything is hot and fresh, we've gone multiple times, and on occasion the trays are semi-empty, but then its rectified right away, so you don't have to ask.  I love their Naan - its fresh hot and wish I could have that every day.    Restaurant is simple yet it works.  Owners are very nice people and are grateful that you came, makes me want to come back again and again."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in town. Love this place. The staff treats you as if you were invited to their home for dinner. they always treat our kids with mango smoothies and desserts to keep them happy while me and the wife enjoy our lunch. The fresh naan is the best I believe I have had and keeps coming throughout your meal. And you can't beat the prices. This place is a true Tempe treasure."}
{"text":"Don't let the look of the area and inside scare you off. It's a family owned, authentic indian buffet and the food is great. This place is a small and somewhat hidden gem. If you like indian food and don't want to pay what most places charge, this may be a good option for you. Limited buffet but all the favorites and they're tasty! I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Great authentic food with excellent service. Terrific value. We loved the amount of choices on the buffet. Clean !"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service!!!!! Great food authentic and the staff was amazingly nice would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Indian buffets in the East Valley -- they have been around for more than 20 years!  The selection is a nice balance of vegetarian and meat (primarily chicken), and all is very good!  They provide naan and have a bakery too.  Service is friendly and ask for their Discount Card that gets you two buffets with soft drinks for only $16!  Great price and value for the food!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Can't beat the prices here! Dinner buffet for 2 came out $21. They give out discounts cards to new customers. Will be a regular stop for us!"}
{"text":"Did anyone else get charged $12.34 for a Haywards 5000 beer? I bought a Groupon for me and my boyfriend, the Groupon gave the option of dining in for the lunch or dinner buffet. When the owner sat us at our table (pretty standoff-ish/not engaging) he told us that the Groupon requires us to buy either a food item or a beverage. So since I already paid for our meals through Groupon all I had to do was pay for my drink---Totally 100% cool with that! He reccomended me to try an Indian beer, so I said \"sure, why not?!\" (Haywards 5000). I assumed it would be MAYBE $6.  When we walked up to the register to pay, I'm not sure if the owner was thinking \"maybe I can get away with charging this person a rediculously obscene amount for one beer.\" --When he gave us the total me and my BF just looked at eachother in confusion. We aren't ones to ever complain at a restaurant so we didn't say anything and just paid for it. So after he took the payment I'm not sure if he felt guilty that all the sudden he was super nice and tried starting up a conversation... once he found out that we drove 30+ minutes across town to eat at his restaurant he continued to be engaging for about 2 minutes, gave us a coupon card and ended with a \"come back, God bless\".  So I know its my fault for not asking how much the beer was but I would just like to know if anyone else was charged that amount? I Google the beer and it goes for $3.99 at a normal liquor store. So seriously? Over $12? The sad thing is that the food was really good. But even if your prices are that high for a beer, that just seems really wrong."}
{"text":"I started eating Indianfood 40 years or so ago in Cerritos California. Never found food as good as in Cerritos. At least till now. This food is just delicous and vibrant. Superb. And the Buffet lasts till 10pm. Unheard of, and just what i always wanted."}
{"text":"Where \"hole in the wall\" is used to parallel what we ALL search for. Great food, Great patrons, Super price and flavor, ALL IN ONE !  MY favorite Indian, bar none . KOHINOOR Indian food ."}
{"text":"Went there last week, they have a NEW Dinner buffet. It cost me around $9 and oh boy it was a steal! They had so much variety of stuff to choose from, lamb,chilli chicken, korma, veggie dishes too...it was awesome! I'm Going to go again tonight, this review thing is making me crave some tikka masala!  The service was Good! It's like family Owned so they welcomed me with love every time I come in!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed out lunch buffet and would visit again. Customer service was great and waiter attentive to tables and needs. Good was good too."}
{"text":"I have been to several Indian buffets in Phoenix and also in San Francisco and Boston and I was definitely pleased with my experience here. I got the Groupon for two buffets for $10 and came in on a Saturday night to find an almost empty restaurant. Nevertheless, the food was hot and fresh and there was a nice variety of options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike, and most of the dishes were very tasty.   The atmosphere is kind of weird particularly some of the employees who watch over you awkwardly and peer out the door hoping the place is going to fill up miraculously. Otherwise would definitely recommend.   P.S. The Naan was delicious. My girlfriend couldn't get enough,"}
{"text":"I'm always so excited when I come here to eat. The food is great, the atmosphere is awesome and I can always sit and relax and enjoy my meal when I'm here. Service is friendly and I love the sweets they have here!"}
{"text":"We found this place through a living social deal $10 for 2 for the buffet option (normally $20). The place looks a little sketchy but the food is outstanding. The feeling inside is somewhat homey, especially with the setup of the food being spread out on a table and the rice in a rice cooker (not necessarily a bad thing). The chicken tikka masala and butter chicken were my favorites. Garlic naan is brought to your table which is definitely some of the better naan I have tried. The buffet desserts are also worth trying a little of each kind. The owners were so friendly and when we paid our bill were given a card for a 2 for $16 buffet coupon card including free drinks."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Indian food.  We were out running errands and decided to drive more than 20 miles to try Kohinoor.  We bought a groupon ($12 for two lunch buffet) on the way there.  When we eat Indian food, we usually just get water (instead of ice tea or soda) to help cut down the richness/spiciness of the food.    When we got there, we were told by the owner that WITH GROUPON, WE MUST PURCHASE TWO DRINKS.  Since we drove so far, we said fine and got two glasses of iced tea.  The owner lingered and proceeded to tell us how the tea is going to be freshly made and etc.  It was as if he was trying to justify the cost of the drinks that he was going to charge us (that we  didn't know yet until we were done with the meal).  For two glasses of iced tea (and we didn't get refills because, like I said earlier, water was we wanted with Indian food), we were charged $8.  That was $4 per glass of iced tea.  We are not stingy tippers, we tipped 20% on the full value of the meal of $20 regardless of how we feel of the food or the overpriced iced tea (I am sure charged to customers to make up for the discount to attract customers).  When we got home, I looked at the fine details of the deal, IT DIDN'T SAY WE HAD TO BUY TWO DRINKS.  We will not be going back and we are not going to use groupon/living social/etc..etc.. again.     On the way home, my husband and I agreed that we should have gone to our usual indian restaurant (FLAVORS OF INDIA on 16th Street in Phoenix) and PAY FULL PRICE knowing we would get great food AND GREAT SERVICE."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed at the cleanliness of this restaurant. I found it on Groupon so I bought a voucher for a lunch buffet for 2 and it was probably the worst experience I ever had. Their customer service was great and they there very friendly but the restaurant, cutlery and tables were extremely filthy which made me question how the food was made in the kitchen. Very very disappointing!"}
{"text":"well i usually do not write reviews, if i do then either angry or really happy with their services.first thing first i liked the way they treat the people. there are few other restaurants in phoenix they do sell their product and done. but this place is different. been in USA for 5 yrs have tried lots of Indian restaurants but the taste was somewhat 'okay', neither satisfied and no complaints. KOHINOOR has the taste of INDIAN flavor, try their appetizer and you can expect what would be next thing to go for.my friends had their buffet it was too delicious and we already decided when would be our next team lunch. i would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST Indian Buffet that I have eaten at in the entire state of AZ! A wonderful, family owned business with the attention and service that most places lack. I love that they are open late and I can get a wonderful dinner at hours when most good restaurants are closed. You can also load up a plate and take it to go if you're in a rush. I eat here at least once a week and feel so fortunate to have such an amazing Indian Restaurant so close to my house.  Do yourself a favor and eat here. Bring your friends, your family, and even grab a stranger and bring them along.  Your mouth and stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"I appreciate great, high quality, authentic food.  Kohinoor Cuisine provides this to the Phoenix metropolitan area.  It is no doubt my favorite Indian restaurant in Arizona (comparable to Anmol in Milwaukee, Historic Mitchell Street); let me tell you, delicious!    It is also worth it to go for just the sweets!  I believe the owner makes them himself and it is as authentic as the food.    I give 5/5 because it is pure quality.  Try the Tikka Masala! Soooooo gooood."}
{"text":"Tried lunch buffet here.they have good variety for vegeterian too.lot of sweets. Samosa and kachori was too good. Naan was excellent.the ambience is also good. The owner spoke to us too. Staff very friendly"}
{"text":"Nice place and really nice owners! The chaat and dessert/sweets are just awesome. However, too many times overcharging errors leave a bad taste."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my wife, mother, and 9mo old this weekend.  We were the only customers and did not have the problems with service that others have reported.  The food was more \"traditional\" than we're used to - still delicious.  We had the assorted appetizer platter and 3 meals off the yellow \"specials\" menu - with one mango lassi, the bill came to $43 with tax.  Note that they don't serve any alcohol, but said we could buy anything we wanted from the grocery next door and drink it with dinner.  So we grabbed a couple of beers.    We were cracking up at the background music + TV - when we arrived they were showing the Indian \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\", and switched to music videos by the time we left.  Quite entertaining."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Indian buffet!! The food is very good and flavorful and spicy : )  The atmosphere is simple yet feels cozy. I did not mind the signs on the wall asking patrons to not waste food as we should all be more mindful of what we can or cannot consume. The price is very fair though inconsistent. The first night we went I used a Groupon for my husband and I and then we were charged only $3.99 for our 8 year old daughter. We loved it so much we came back 4 days later with our 16 year old daughter and no Groupon (to give the restaurant more money) and were charged $10 per person including our 8 year old daughter. I really like the food and was trying to be kind to the owners by not using a coupon but I may use a Groupon every time....."}
{"text":"They have an all day and night buffet weekly! So much flavor, some can be pretty spicy but so good! No pakora but delicious samosas!! Their garlic naan is delicious and comes with the buffet. We usually leave overly full but crave to return weekly. :)"}
{"text":"This is the worst indian restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life.food is so awful, tasteless,flavourless.Not a single item is good.we had lunch buffet n there were samosa,kachori ,veg and non veg curries but not a single item was good.i wonder how people come n eat there .mostly students from ASU visiting because price is cheap.But I Wil never go there ever again."}
{"text":"This may be the only place in PHX that makes their own Indian sweets. That is worth a trip. They are authentic and delicious. The buffet is good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Kohinoor is a wonderful indian food place with very reasonable prices!!! There are two options for ordering take out 1) buffet take out - they give you a to go container and allow you to fill it at their buffet, then they charge you by weight (5.99/lb) This is my favorite option since I like an array of dishes from them!  2) Take out by menu, this is your usual take out, you look at the menu pick the dishes you want and order (even the menu items are well priced) - they make these items to order :) my favorite dishes from kohinoor have been; Chicken tikka masala, onion bhaji, chicken makhni, palak paneer, and their eggplant bhartha. The chicken dishes are made with good quality chicken, unlike so many other indian food places in AZ. This definitely rivals some of my favorite indian restaurants in So Cal. A must try!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when i bought this Group On deal for dinner buffet but I love trying new places. First ....Don't judge this place from the outside. Looks like it could be a hole in the wall but the inside is much more pleasing. The food was good, staff friendly and attentive, and the price seemed about right. For sure they have beer but I'm not sure about other alcohol. The selection was minimal compared to other Indian places I've been to. This place has mostly meat dishes so I wouldn't recommend to vegan or vegetarians."}
{"text":"This is the best indian food in Phoenix. Hands down. Their buffet has so much flavor, and actually puts Spicy food out. And their prices are amazing to boot.  If you like Indian desserts, this place also gets really high marks. I definitely recommend the thing that looks like an orange funnel cake covered in maple syrup. I have no idea what it is called but I get some every time. That and the spicy chicken curries that show on the buffet.  Also, the employees here really care about you. They're always super nice and coming to ask how you are doing and how your day is.  Five stars. Skip the overpriced Scottsdale madness and get yourselves over to Tempe."}
{"text":"Horrible service from the owners, the lady at the front was coming at me like she wanted to fight simply because I had a Groupon.  They then proceeded to tell me their Groupon is worthless and shouldn't have been purchased.  I don't know how anyone can run a business like this...I will NEVER be back.  Horrible service paired with less than mediocre food.  There are so many restaurants that are way better than this place in the same area."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in the heart of  ASU that I think anyone or everyone should try, when in the area.  Undeniable IndoPaki food that would melt your heart,  save you money and satisfy your craving for exotic foods. I have visited this place repeatedly with family, love one and friends.   So the next time you think Indian food, come check it out! I assure you, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"All you can eat Chicken Masala, a quiet pleasant atmosphere, and the perfect price. This is the best Indian food in the area. It's a casual dining experience with a around 20 dishes to try at the buffet. There is a large number of vegetarian options as well. They kept the nan coming as we ate and they will keep me coming back for sure.    A delicious gem right off the ASU campus. Can't wait till next time. Keep an eye out for Groupons if you want to save a few bucks."}
{"text":"Went to kohinoor today for the lunch buffet. The service was on the verge of being unbelievable, it was so bad. We were never offered a beverage besides water, and NEVER received water refills (luckily we had a water bottle). Our used plates were never cleared and we had to continually stack them to make room at our table. The lack of service would have been forgivable, if the food was incredible, but it wasn't. The rice was watery, the chicken in the korma did not taste fresh, the tamarind sauce was thick like molasses and they never served the palak paneer, even though there was a marked spot for it. None of the multifaceted, delicate signature flavors we love about Indian food were present here. The best part ofv the experience was the humor we found in the utter ineptitude of the staff. To top off the laughable lack of etiquette, after paying our bill, the cashier (presumably the owner) instructed us to put the change he just handed us into his tip jar. Ha! Hilarious! Tip you for what? Over charging us for less than mediocre food, or ignoring us completely? Never again. I'll just keep going to Delhi Palace. Not sure why this place has such good reviews. If you actually know and love Indian food, then know better than to give this place a second look."}
{"text":"This is just the kind of restaurant I love. Outstanding food at a very reasonable price, fast and friendly service with no pretentious atmosphere or attitude. It's just a small family working their butts off to serve up a great variety of Indian favorites in a high quality way. And lots of Indian families come here to eat, which attests to the authenticity and quality."}
{"text":"My whole family had the buffet, it was delicious! I normally do not like buffets but the food was fabulous. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Oh, Kohinoor!  How I miss the days when your vegetarian specials were but $3.99.  Heaping piles of rice, tofu, and vegetables for a sum no man could refuse.  Vegetable Bhriyani that could mend broken souls.  Even still, when you did raise your prices to $4.99, it is still worth it.  The endearing old grouch who runs you and bakes your delicious sweets only treats his customers so gruffly because he does not know how to express his love for them, which he must obviously have to be the purveyor of an establishment that serves good food at such ridiculously low prices.  (RE: Amandia M.'s review:  yes, you will pay way too much if you order off the regular menu.  Stick with the specials and you will not find a better deal - $4.99 or $5.99.  If you want a drink, go with the mango lassi - it is pretty good, and will be worth the price, unlike the sodas.)"}
{"text":"Went with a Groupon for the Buffet. At least half the dishes were too salty to eat. I mentioned this to the Owner(?) and she said that everyone's taste is different. The mango lassi was too sweet too."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place. This is the best indian restaurant i have eaten at. Period.  My family and i stopped here for dinner on our way to Sedona. We loved the food so much we changed our return route from Grand Canyon, just to eat here.   Its wonderful food and the people are truly generous and lovely.  You will love this place."}
{"text":"Came here because of a restaurant.com coupon. Although Yelp says it opens till 11, the final word from owner is that it closes at 9:30pm even though their door says 10pm. We arrived at 8pm and pretty much all there was left was rice and sauce. The person at cashier also said in order to use the restaurant.com coupon we had to order drinks or it will be charged on the bill anyway. Well the coupon didn't mention that we had to get drinks. What a scam. Sauce was really spicy. Never coming back."}
{"text":"This isn't the fanciest looking Indian buffet.  Especially from the outside it's not located in the nicest plaza. However, I did find the service and food quality to be quite surprising. We were greeted when we walked in and went to straight to the buffet.  This Indian buffet offers a lot of variety compared to your other 9.99 Indian buffets. They had appetizers (somosas!) and a decent selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. They had both goat and lamb dishes- something you usually don't find. Whenever something hot come out of the kitchen they brought the dish over to our table and personally served us freshly made Indian food. The garlic Nann was also fresh and doughy- just the way I like it! Overall, I'd give this place a 4 star FOR its category (cheap Indian lunch buffets). You really have to try this place and experience this family's small restaurant."}
{"text":"Best restaurant to eat at for both  vegetarian people and meat lovers! They have lots of delicious Indian food to choose from! Eat all you want for 1 price!The food is kept hot and fresh on the buffet all day. The owners love to  conversate with customers  every time we stop in for dinner they always greet us and provide a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing the buffet, not the menu. It's a buffet I recommend especially if you look for their groupon.   Great selection for a lunch buffet and everything is delicious. My personal favorite is the chicken tikka masala but that's my favorite Indian dish anywhere. The garlic naan is top notch as well in all it's fantastic value for the buffet. Service is friendly too it is a mom and pop shop so the owners handle everything.  I gave it four stars instead of five because of my own taste preferences. Everything seemed to be too spicey for my liking and nothing is labeled spicy so it can be a surprise. Also to be entirely honest I have had better-tasting Indian cuisine but i will admit it was almost twice as much in cost and they do not have Kohnoor's selection. The atmosphere is also a bit dimly lit for a restaurant but most other Indian restaurants I've been to are also dimly lit so this could be a cultural thing. In all it did not wow me inside but it is very clean and nothing looks old so it is a place you could bring someone, though it is a shame there is so much construction outside and the neighborhood around doesn't look nice as a result.  In summary all my negatives are purely subjective. I will be coming back here and I recommend you try it too."}
{"text":"Authentic and really good. We will be back for the buffet for sure. A little quirky but lovely."}
{"text":"Well if you dont like crowds this place is for you. Rand H.and I went to this place at lunch hour and never seen one other customer the entire time we were there. As far as the food goes it was not bad the selection was limited.I am a fan of samosas and theirs were good other then that the food was average east indian .The decor is one star and needs work .Oh yes you can get a can of pepsi out of one of the buffet trays a first for myself.So if you like to eat alone kohinoor is the place."}
{"text":"Wonderful!  The food had great flavor and the spicy things were warm not killer. I was so impressed with the family nature and great service! Loved seeing the many ASU students and how at home they felt. Even my picky eater found things she enjoyed."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. I live in the West Valley but I eat here almost every time I'm in Tempe. They gave me a coupon for the buffet, which is 2 for $16 for the buffet and includes free soft drinks. That's literally $8 a person for a delicious endless Indian buffet, which is amazing! They also bring out wonderful naan to your table.   By the way, half the buffet is vegetarian friendly! Definitely support them, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"After having been to a few different Indian restaurants in the valley, I'd say that this one is one of the better ones! Their buffet offers a quite a few vegetarian options including curries & samosas; they have 4 or 5 different kinds of chicken options - chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, karahi chicken, etc. along with egg curry. The best part is that with the buffet, you can also get naan, a plate of chaat, & mango lassi. The food is a little bit on the spicy side but it's really tasty. As with pretty much all buffets, the desserts aren't that great, a little bit surprising considering that they sell them in bulk. The highlights are definitely the mango lassi, naan, chicken tikka masala, & chaat! I will go back for those every time!"}
{"text":"I went her with my friend as we tried a new place, he'd been before. To say I am not one for hot spicy food so I got the milder stuff but the chicken was delicious."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment that I still had to pay over $5 after purchasing a Groupon. I had a long human hair in my naan. Ewwww. Never going back."}
{"text":"I had been going to the same Indian restaurant for a while but I recently moved and decided to check out something new. It's an Indian buffet, which in my opinion is the only way to eat Indian food, but the setup of the buffet was a little weird and sadly, the food was hit and miss. They had the plates next to the dessert and then it worked backwards. There were a few rice cookers sitting here and there. I felt like quite a few of the dishes were rather bland, which I didn't know was possible for Indian food. However, on the flip side of that coin they had one dish that may be the best curry dish I've ever had. They also had good service. Our water glasses were never empty. One suggestion I would make is serve garlic Naan :)"}
{"text":"Plain awful food. We went for the lunch buffet on a Sunday. The vegetable rice in the rice cooker was bland. No spice or whatsoever. The samosa was just a piece of rock. The kadai paneer tasted horrible. The ambience of the place is bad. Overall - the worst Indian food you can have in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Yum! Seriously, really good food!!  Really clean place, and really nice owners... I loved my experience and cant wait to come back!!!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"I liked it the first time I came here but the other time I came with my roommate it was disgusting. The curries are all old and the owners seem to be randomly nice or rude. Not consistent. The place looks like a dump. I think they have recently closed down or moved. I hope they closed down and ran out of business. Even the Groupon coupon that these guys post is a scam. You have to buy a drink for each person in order to use that coupon, and even that's not worth it because it'll end up costing the same amount of money as another buffet for one more person."}
{"text":"I thought the food was average, the service average, and the environment (yet again) average. I have had Indian food many times before, and often I will order the same dish at different restaurants to find the best. My personal favorite Indian dish is Lamb Korma (yogurt-based curry), and theirs was not as good as most that I've had. The daal, on the other hand, was amazing and had garbanzo beans in it rather than whatever other bean usually goes in daal which really made it amazing. The naan was not bad either. As far as the service goes, I and my group were ignored (even though there were three tables filled in the entire restaurant) when we were done eating, and we had to go and hunt down a waiter. The environment was all-right, but I did find the constant blaring of the Indian beauty pageant and music videos a little annoying (because of the volume), but certainly interesting to watch."}
{"text":"Ordered carry-out from here tonight.  Food was excellent!  I ordered it medium and they spiced it perfectly. Malai Kofta and Aloo Palak were delicious.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic food with great portions! Friendly service and full bar! More than satisfied with our shared options of veggie samosas, naan (a whole page of naan options), masalas, paneer, and veggie options! Strip mall from the outside but quaint and comfortable on the inside! Worthwhile!"}
{"text":"Great  service , the owner is really nice especially if you speak Hindi. The waiters are very attentive when it comes to filling drinks, taking plates and making sure that you are satisfied. We came in around 9pm and the buffet was still full and worth it ( $10 per person) . My girlfriend is a vegetarian and she enjoyed the sahi paneer and I'm Non-Veg and I loved the tandoori chicken and chicken masala. If you guys enjoy beer than I would recommend Hayward 5000 to add delightful yet unique favor. P. S. the bathrooms are clean, and check Groupon out if your looking for dinner for 2."}
{"text":"Currently sits at #1 for the best Indian in AZ for me. It's a buffet with a great selection for vegetarian, vegan, and meat eaters, it's crazy cheap, and it's super flavorful as well as spicy. Just let them know you're vegan, they can show you the ones you can have."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Indian food I've had in Phoenix!! The Samosas were probably fried 3 times before they were served. The food did not taste fresh. The entire dinner buffet tasted like it was re-heated from the lunch buffet. Would not recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Best food in town! The owners and servers are always extremely hospitable and courteous. We used to live an hour away and still made the trip here cause the food is just that good. We actually decided to move into our current home because it was close to this restaurant. Yes, it is really THAT good. I've been going to this buffet for 3 years now. It's the only indian buffet I've ever been to and I love it. I've been to indian restaurants before and have always felt like I could have ate more of whatever I ordered. Here, I don't have to worry about that. I always leave full and satisfied. There's plenty of vegetarian dishes which is greatly appreciated. The food is amazing! I can never get enough of the sag paneer and the dish with cheese in it with some sauce, not sure what it's called but it's my favorite thing here. The owners are really nice people and have great customer service skills. They always make sure me and my girlfriend are taken care of. As soon as we step inside they start making our mango lassi's and nan bread. We don't even have to ask for it. I love it. There's no other restaurant that I would recommend more than this one. Everything about this place is awesome and leaves you wanting to come back everyday. There was a week where we actually came 4 times. If you're craving indian, this is the spot to go to! The desserts are pretty darn good here too. I get rice pudding and mix it with fruit custard and a few pieces of milk candy. Did I mention this place is affordable? It's like 10 bucks per person and if you go as a family of three they might give you a special price if you ask them about it and go there often. The restaurant is always clean. They have a television that is always on either one of two things, indian music videos or WWE wrestling. I prefer the wrestling but the music videos are cool to watch when eating this type of food. They sell tons of different authentic indian beers which is pretty cool. I can literally come here everyday. Love everything about it."}
{"text":"Great place to experience various Indian dishes. The buffet is well kept and of good variation. The servers are always friendly and quick to refill drinks etc. The owner is always at the check out and routinely visits to check all is well and is quick to offer up recommendations. Good value."}
{"text":"It was just.. OK. Normally, I LOVE \"hole-in-the-wall\" restaurants. If you're expecting bougie, go elsewhere.  Their desserts, kheer and gulab jamun, were delicious. However, the fried mango dessert thing that looked like a pretzel was.. a little strange, but maybe it's an accustomed taste?  The curries, on the other hand, were hit or miss. Some were great (spicy chicken was decent) but others tasted off (the tikka masala was meh, the tandoori chicken was a little dry - not horrible - but dry). Their samosas were good.  I did LOVE their chutney selection (mint, tamarind, yogurt) and the waiter was quick to take our empty plates and clear our table, so that was wonderful.  The biggest pro for me, however, was their garlic naan - it was absolutely delicious, and I usually never like garlic naan! Definitely a big winner tonight.  One note: if you use the Groupon available, read the fine print and make sure you're aware you need to buy one additional food item. I chose to purchase a takeout portion of the gulab jamun (yum). A little pricy for $5 but I had to buy something to use the Groupon.  I'm not very picky for Indian buffets, especially ones that run less than $14 like Kohinoor, but the venue was just.. underwhelming. I'd probably shop around and try the other Indian AYCE restaurants before I'd come back here. (I have to say though, their garlic naan was the best naan I ever had.)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It's cozy, intimate, and very affordable! What could be better? The staff are very kind.  I love their garlic Naan. I'm only giving it for stuff because the food is a bit spicy for me. My boyfriend loved it, however. Give this spot a chance! It's one of my favorites in Tempe right now."}
{"text":"Best thing at the Buffett is the delicious, super fresh, perfectly prepared paneer - it's sooo yummy- I've never had better!"}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for a good dining deal, I finally decided to try this place after seeing the positive reviews of a number of my friends - and they were right! While not knock-your-socks-off spectacular, the food is good, well-seasoned, and sufficiently varied with several Indian standards to make for a most satisfying meal. Friendly service, a clean and spacious dining area, and a relatively quiet atmosphere make for a pleasant dining experience. While the buffet does offer desserts, there is a variety of Indian sweets for sale at the counter near the entrance - I've tried some of those and they were scrumptious."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for $11 and came here for the dinner buffet.  My husband and I were not impressed.  First I have to preface by saying I don't know much about Indian food.  My husband and I prefer a couple restaurants closer to us, closer to Chandler.  The food here was way too salty and bland.  I tried the desserts and they were way to sweet AND I have a sweet tooth!  We will probably not come back here even though the cashier gave us a coupon and mentioned that there is another coupon on Living Social."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very vegan friendly. Both times Ive eaten here the owner and the server gave me a tour of the buffet and explicitly pointed out the items which were meat and dairy free. They also made naan without butter for me. My girlfriend enjoyed all of the dishes she sampled and they were not all vegan. It os also important to mention that the quality of the food was really nice and the buffet had lots of steam pouring fron it, which indicates to me that health standards are important.  I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Amazing must try buffet! Totally worth the money. Owner was super nice and friendly and made sure the customers are happy :)"}
{"text":"This review is coming from an Indian who loves Indian food. So believe me when I say the food is not good at all. We went for the Sunday dinner buffet.   Food: They had shahi paneer, palak (spinach), chole, baingan (eggplant), daal, chicken korma, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, chicken masala, chicken meatballs and samosa. Most of the items were not refilled. The samosa was stale. The chutneys had color added to them. Rice is kept in rice cookers and the rice cookers were extremely dirty. The naan that was served at the table was cold and not crisp at all.   Service: Service was good.   Ambience: Tables were very dirty. It is very very casual. The plates were a little dirty as well.  For the price ~$14, the food was very oily, salty and did not taste authentic or good."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner buffet with a lot of selection. The three chicken dishes are so good.I will be back. There are not a lot of Indian restaurants that offer a dinner buffet.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the plague. Go *literally* anywhere else.  My dad, brother, and I came here because we had a $25 coupon. Before we even entered, the actual location of the restaurant is really shady. \"Okay, I thought. Let's not jump to conclusions\". When we entered, the waiter greeted us and told us to sit wherever we'd like. Good service so far, but it just goes downhill from here. The food itself was mediocre, and I'm not that picky of an eater. When my dad walked up to the waiter to ask about the food, he was completely ignored. He repeated himself several times and the waiter didn't even acknowledge his presence.  After we finished up, we headed to the register to pay and an older gentleman, who I presume to be the owner, rang us up. The bill came out to approximately $40. At this time, we presented the $25 coupon and the owner tells us that it's for menu items only. Nowhere on the coupon itself did it exclude anything. We had the buffet because no one told us there was an actual menu. At this point, he presents a menu to me and says \"here it is\". We were forced to pay the full tab to our extreme displeasure.  Never have I had an experience as bad as this at a restaurant. I *implore* you to avoid this restaurant and save yourself from a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Not really a big a fan of the dinner buffet. However the samosas pakoras and sweets are amazing. A must have is the paratha platter. Number 41 42 on their yellow menu. Potato/ cauliflower / paneer paratha with palak saag, chole, rice, deal and yogurt. Don't forget to try some Indian beers with it."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre, made a few of my coworkers throw up after they got home 20 minutes later. Horrible customer service. Mr. Singh was very rude, not personable, and he said that he \"doesn't care if anyone leaves him bad reviews because he's been in business for 30 years.\" Avoid this restaurant if you want good customer service and don't want to be sick. :-)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming here! Everyone is always nice and friendly and accommodating, plus the food is great. Buffet style is really nice and fresh, plus you can always count on a fresh warm basket of naan at your table. Overall really good authentic Indian food with great staff."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place.  I went to ASU, ahem... like a decade ago, and never knew this place was here.  I'm a HUGE fan of Indian food and eat it every time I travel, so I'd like to think I know good ones from bad.  There are a few buffets around the valley I've been to and some skimp on the protein.  Some serve food that's gotten old and even stale.  These guys are a great value for the price, have ample meats for the non-veggies, and are pretty attentive.  Can't beat what they offer for the price."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times and this by far our favorite Indian restaurant! The food is always so fresh no matter the time of day you go and very tasty! Just the right amount of spicy on their dishes which I enjoy! They also do a very good job at offering vegetarian options which my husband enjoys. Service is always excellent and very attentive. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very enjoyable and relaxing as well. They  never disappoint!! Definitely a restaurant you want to check out if you're in the ASU/ Tempe area or just looking for tasty Indian cuisine!"}
{"text":"OMG...dinner buffet and it's authentic Indian food. I don't post many reviews on Yelp, but this place ROCKS and I went on a Wednesday night! If you like Indian food then TRUST ME! BTW, grab a Taj Mahal while you wait for your greedy azz stomach to subside."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss, but the people running it are pretty awesome. I love the mint sauce here and the mango lassies are tops. The thing that really urks me about Kohi though is the consistency... There have been times that I've gone there and had some fantastic Indian food and other times where I was satisfied but not impressed at all. Every restaurant has there off days though, I'm sure. The samosas with a little mint sauce are always pretty legit however.   Kohinoor is one of the cheaper Indian restaurants to eat at, be it lunch buffet or dinner, and for that, it's worth giving a try...especially if you're a fan of hole-in-the-wall restaurants like me."}
{"text":"I went here on the recommendation of a friend.  I was not impressed.  The location/neighborhood is scary.  The restaurant is old and outdated inside.  The prices for the complete dinner was very reasonable.  The spice level on my meal ordered mild to medium came out HOT. (compared to others at my table and the way they ordered their dinner).  The naan was good when hot, not so good as it cooled down.  The mango lassi was delicious! The service was inattentive and lacking.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"The BEST Indian buffet in Phoenix! We visit at least once a month, even though it is a drive for us.  The selection is always great with plenty of actually spicy options. I cannot recommend this restaurant's buffet enough."}
{"text":"Kohinoor Cuisine offers buffets with a large variety of good food for great prices ($8 lunch, $10 dinner). I went for lunch. There were around 7 meat dishes and 6 or 7 vegetarian dishes, along with multiple sweets/desserts and sauces. I sampled most of the meat dishes and a couple of the vegetarian, and liked them all. It was my first time trying paneer; it was very tasty. Wish I had tried more of their confections, I only ate some marzipan. Next time!  The staff is friendly and attentive, my glass was quickly refilled whenever it got low on water."}
{"text":"Kohinoor is a very informal, non-cool looking place near ASU. Here are the top reasons to go there (I am a vegetarian - so cannot comment on the meat dishes )...  1) Food tastes like homemade, tasty and piping hot. Can be requested spicy which is the way I like it  2) Unbelievable value for money. Anyone who has eaten Indian food in other places in the valley and other cities in US know that to get really good Indian food, you have to pay $$$. Not here. Vegitarian thali's are $6 to $8 (fancier menu). I DO NOT EAT BUFFETS. My personal feeling is like Buffet's are just a huge quality compromise.  3) Food is healthy. I have been eating here since 1999 and not had a bad stomach or any other issues. Like I said dinners are served hot and fresh...  Points that some people might not like:  1) Owner sometimes looks like he has the burden of the world on him, very sad...  2) Ambience is average as it goes, not something that you look forward to.  3) Very casual atmosphere, so sometimes, we find multiple tables dirty and we just find a good spot and fill water ourselves...Treat it like home.  4) Bollywood songs/videos/programs are telecast. Some people come just for that, and others just sit with their backs to the TV, simple solution.  But as I am moving out of Phx to Austin, I find that I will miss Kohinoor the most. Very affordable, healthy , spicy and tasty vegetarian food is a rarity.  N'joy."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good! When you walk in, it kind of looks like a hole in the wall but the food is so good! As someone who knows a little about indian food, the set up can be confusing to new people. The dessert and the sauces for the entrees were next to the plates where you start. I will say this is one of the better indian places I've been to. I recommend you try a little of everything."}
{"text":"Having been born and raised in India, I think I can tell decent Indian food :) The restaurant itself is alright nothing spectacular, the mango lassi was alright, too sweet for me personally but the consistency was good. We liked the garlic naan and the pieces of paneer were soft and creamy but the gravies were very very bland. They all tasted the same, with different things in them. I did love their samosas(just potato not peas and potato) and their dosa was not bad, sambar was nice. The owner was very friendly the first time and not so much the second when I came here with a group of people. The value for money was decent, the naan was hot and fresh. The mithai (sweets) were average, the jalebi was soft and cold as was the gulab jamun (maybe a lot of people prefer it cold, I personally like it warm), when cold the syrup almost crystallizes. Indian sweets are usually very rich and sweet but somehow these were sweeter, I couldn't even finish one jalebi and I adore sweets."}
{"text":"An amazing and must visit place for a foodie. One best authentic  Indian food in Tempe. The Samosa is  the winner."}
{"text":"First tip the whole groupon thing is a sham as the discount, says you need to buy an overpriced drink that would be included with the normal price.  Second issue is the shady location, my wife and I were pan handled numerous times in the small parking lot.   On the upside most of the food was acceptable, but with a catch, the bindi masla was a bit salty and the palak had a bunt taste"}
{"text":"My husband has never really had India cuisine and we have been watching documentaries lately featuring India food. This place is awesome! Great selections of different authentic food and friendly staff. We will be back! I love supporting family owned business like this!"}
{"text":"Decent food.  Accommodating hosts- I am sensitive to spicy foods and they made me a special dish even though I was having the buffet.  Bathroom could be cleaner."}
{"text":"I haven't been able to find a better buffet in the area than this one! It is simple and inexpensive, and we always get a few refills of naan :) It is a cute little place if you are looking for a good date spot. Much classier than most buffets. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Family owned, authentic and delicious.  Found this restaurant through living social and I'm so glad we gave it a try.  Will definitely be back.  The chicken masala and chicken korma were my favorite but really, everything was delicious.  The owner could not gave been nicer.  Gave us lots of personal attention.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I would only rate it 3 stars but I'll give it another star simply because they offer dinner buffet! No longer am I limited to lunch buffet when Im craving different kinds of Indian food.  Hidden in the strip malls surrounding ASU, this little hole in the wall is great for cheap but good Indian food. I wouldn't say it's along the same caliber as Chutney's or Nandini, but for the price you pay for the dinner buffet here ($10)- thats hardly enough to pay for one dinner meal in other restaurants. So if you want to be adventurous and try out different entrees at dinner, Kohinoor is the way to go.   PS. Mango lassi is included in the buffet!"}
{"text":"This place is legit!  Coming from OC SoCal, I've eaten at many Indian restaurants.  This is absolutely one of the best--if not, the best--Indian buffet I've enjoyed.  The staff was great as well.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Great buffet on a budget! $10 for all-you-can-eat buffet of a nice variety of chicken and vegetable dishes. On my regular Thursday evening visit I saw no less than 6 different types of curry!  We were so stuffed at the end of our meal that we had a tough time getting in the car. Geez!  I would give this place 5 stars if the food wasn't as salty next time. Every dish was slightly salty, so I had to mix it with more rice than I normally do. I don't know if this had to do with buffet heating (vaporizing water in the dish) or that they do it on purpose to get you full on rice... but seeing that it was only 730pm on my visit, I don't think the food had been sitting out for that long."}
{"text":"Kohinoor Cuisine of India is great place to get Indian food at near Tempe. They offer a lunch and dinner buffet, as well as a carry-out buffet! Additionally, they have an Indian bakery which is a nice departure from the typical Indian restaurants. ASU students get a discount, the buffet has all the classic dishes, and you get a free Mango Lasse with the buffet! My only recommendation is that they add a couple more dishes to the buffet, and are more careful when chopping up chicken as to not include bone fragments within the curries.  I'll be back next time I'm in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Why go to one of the very few but overpriced restaurants in Tempe when you can get the same home-cooked quality here? Delicious and plentiful buffet, especially the vegetarian dishes. We always appreciate the great service. Plus, this place has the best burfi in town!"}
{"text":"Omg. Amazing Indian cuisine. Service is wonderful. Gabi is so sweet. If you want it a little extra spicy they can anything to taste. The buffet is absolutely amazing. Everything was delicious. Not a fan of the deserts but that's not why I love Indian food so it's all good."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty big fan of Indian food and have tried a lot of the places in the area, but this one is hands down my favorite.  The buffet has a good amount of variety (it takes two trips just to try everything once!) and the food is high quality, but there are two things about this place that especially make it stand out to me: their huge samosas that are OUT OF THIS WORLD and my favorite thing on the buffet (make sure to try with the tamarind sauce on it!), and their dessert section includes some things you don't see other places.  My favorite thing there is the barfi, which again is almost impossible to find at other buffets.  The food may be a little spicy for some people - my mother can't handle it so when she wants Indian I reluctantly have to bring her somewhere else.  But if you're willing to drink a little extra water, or order one of their delicious mango lassis to manage the spiciness, then you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"After going here for a long time we revisit it recently and was surprised to see how the owners were mistreating their employees. We noticed very aggressive and Loud yelling about very minor mistakes made by the employees and have now decided never to return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"There is no better tasting Indian food than Kohinoor. They have a great low price for all you eat lunch and dinner buffet. Also I like how the dining area is comfortable and dark in a nice way. I have been to over 20 different Indian restaurants and this place has the best flavor. Great Service and open until 11pm!! What more could you want?"}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is delicious. Service is always super fast. They'll also let you pay by the pound if you'd rather just grab from the buffet and leave. I've eaten here at least a dozen times and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Got the Chicken Tikka Masala. The chicken was in big, tender chunks, and the sauce was creamy, buttery and rich. The garlicky Naan was to die for as well. Great food for a reasonable price. I will most definitely come back again and again."}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet out there! All the best classic dishes and a variety of desserts! This is our favorite place!  My husband loves spicy and I can't handle it so here he has the option to put as much spicy sauce on as he wants while I can have a yummy meal without dying from the heat. And who can beat the price for all the food you get?"}
{"text":"Really love this place. I have gone to a few other Indian restaurants nearby but this one is my favorite. Great service always the same faces working when I go there. I'm new to Indian food but their buffet is great. Definitely my new comfort food. My weekly spot.  Family friendly and they have great beers!"}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon so long ago that expired, but wanted to still try this place and not lose my $10.  OMG it totally rocked today.  Seldom do I give 5 stars, but this was so much better than other Indian restaurants that we tried.  We had the lunch buffet and were actually waiting for them to open at 11:30.  Every dish we tried was better than the previous.  There was nothing that I would not have enjoyed seconds except the chickpea dish was a bit too hot for me (wimp).  Naan was hot and thin so it was great addition to the meal.  Loved the spinach dish and the samosa had a flaky crust and was one of the best I've had.  The chicken norma was both our favorites and the sweet rice pudding was perfect ending.  The server was attentive and kept my tea refilled and our plates cleared.  Definitely planning a return trip and looking forward to enjoying the dinner buffet too."}
{"text":"If you blink you'll miss it and you'll kick yourself if you do.  Mom and pop restaurant with Very friendly owners (owner gave homless man two togo containers of food for nothing even though he offered her 5$) and very friendly wait staff.  Its a small buffet but is so good, you won't even care.  Had a Groupon and the owner gave me a discount card that is cheaper then Groupon for next time and there will be a next time.  The only con is the crowd of young adults that have nothing better to do then hang out in the mini marts parking lot."}
{"text":"Had been to Kohinoor with my friends today. Savored a sumptuous vegetarian buffet. The samosas and pakodas had authentic Indian essence. Enjoyed the crispy butter naan and paneer butter masala made in pure ghee. The owner got to know it was my birthday treat and he gave me a box full of sweets as complimentary :) Awesome buffet at economical price."}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time the food was pretty good although I have nothing to compare it to since it was my first time having indian food... went here with my kids and hubby and we all enjoyed it..the service was good too ..the owner was also very attentive. .. I believe it was around 8 chicken entrees and 8 vegetable 3 types of rice and I think a out 3-5 types of dessert...I can't recall any of the names tho =(... but overall it was a good experience =)"}
{"text":"Terrible place. We had a Groupon and my friends came later and joined us. They sat with us and also had a Groupon. The owner ended up not letting us use our Groupon per a party because he said that we all sat at one table. Had we known his stupid ruling we would have sat seperatly. The guy was very rude about it too.   The food was also not that great. It was good but not that amazing."}
{"text":"More variety than most lunch buffets, economically  priced, and best of all - Delicious! Every thing tasted like it was made fresh from good ingredients."}
{"text":"Have been looking for an Indian restaurant that serves buffet style for dinner so I was excited when I was told about this place. The food is good with solid Indian spices and flavors. Tried a beer that was imported from India called Taj Mahal which was pretty good. The naan was missing the garlic flavor I'm used to at other restaurants. The service was friendly albeit a little difficult to understand because he spoke so softly. The reason for not posting more stars is that the table cloths on the tables were dirty as well as the floors. If not for the food, they would have gotten a lower score."}
{"text":"I'm not a seasoned Indian food connoisseur, but this place is great.   It's simple and the owners are very nice.   I've had great buffet food both times I have been there (once with a groupon).   The shopping center kind of reminds me of a place where I might get mugged/kidnapped, but whatever."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The service is more than friendly and the food is of the upmost quality, absolutely delicious. For $10 the buffet is more than worth it. I will absolutely be returning."}
{"text":"Very good value. The food was decent, and we got an unlimited supply of naan bread. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet 40 minutes before they closed - the management let us order off the normal menu but charged only buffet price. The food was deliciously prepared.  Saw some comments from other people about the neighborhood - it's fine, unless you're terrified of Asiatic engineering students."}
{"text":"My go to for Indian food in Tempe. I recommend the chili chicken. The owners are very friendly, and often include one of the incredibly sweet Indian desserts with the order. The desserts are crazy sweet. Wow. I can't even really hang with them. The chicken, all the types I've had from them, are great though. I usually go with the chili chicken with a side of delicious delicious junglee pakora. Yet to be disappointed.   Despite the fact that I've since moved to Phoenix, and am in the process of exploring the cuisines here, I still head back to Kohinoor when I'm in the old hood."}
{"text":"Food was good and as usual they kept bugging us about buying a drink.  Water works for me! The lady at the register was crappy and charged us for drinks even though we didn't order any.  There goes your tip people. There's plenty of Indian restaurants in the area.  Sorry, we won't be back to this one anymore.  You just lost 2 good customers."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant today because of it's consistently perfect health department ratings. The restaurant was in fact immaculate, and the food very tasty and authentic. The service was friendly, prompt and and helpful. We were pleased and will return and tell our friends."}
{"text":"Small little hidden gem in tempe. All the food is so flavorful compared to the rest of the food around here. The Chicken Tikka Masala is out of this world delicious. So glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Nan's and non veg curry was good....loved the custard fruit salad......biryani was not up to expectation......god knows about veg food....lamb curry was good...."}
{"text":"Lots of choices for good Indo-Pakistani cuisine in the Valley, but this spot stands out as the best in Tempe for a number of reasons - the goat is off the chain good; the daal almost makes me want to become a vegan; and the naan is by FAR! the best naan you will encounter in the Valley. Add in great guest services & a litany of desserts & snacks - this Indian restaurant will make you a true believer!"}
{"text":"Saw it on groupon and decided to go in...ended up just paying for the buffet for 10...which was excellent. The only item that was not fresh they replenished within 5 minutes of my being there. The service was great, free naan and they gave a mango drink for free. I haven't had Indian food in a long time and I live in south Scottsdale so I've seen some expensive Indian food going north...this seemed pretty inexpensive and was more fresh than any I've seen...at 830 on a Wednesday, so that's a plus. Last Indian food I had in tempe was the royal taj on Broadway, I used to go there all the time. I got an expensive plate of lamb saag to go at 845 and got food poisoning, so maybe my experience here is a bit tainted. Either way, I liked it...and I'm picky with Indian food...I'll see how my stomach holds out tonight (a little worried after reading the reviews) and maybe update to a higher rating after another visit...consistency is key with buffets."}
{"text":"The staff here is extremely rude. They called one of their servers as being mentally ill and said she was homeless while she was cleaning up the tables."}
{"text":"Dinner buffet with lots of Veg and non veg options. Owner is friendly and humble. Ambience is not great but it's in university area so it's ok."}
{"text":"The staff at Kohinoor Cuisine have exquisite customer service skills . They are always friendly and quickly clear away your plate once done. They are on top of your refills whether its the bread or beverage. The food has just the perfect amount of spicy and is always fresh. Before you leave don't forget the yummy dessert. This place comes HIGHLY recommended"}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS GREAT! The amount of options are great!  The people are great! The vibe is great! And the price is right! You must make sure to try this place for a cozy, quaint, and yummy hidden gem in Tempe!!!!"}
{"text":"By far this is my favorite Indian restaurant in the Valley!  Listen to me people, lets keep this simple, Kohinoor style.    If you are looking for a super-fancy, sitar playing, well decorated place to eat then move on because this ain't that type of Indian food joint! However, if you are looking for awesome traditional Indian food at an EXCELLENT price, then this is the place for you!  Kohinoor is located right by ASU in Tempe, so all you college students pay attention, because if I was in school over there I'd be eating at this place all semester long.  It's open until 11pm 7 days a week, and includes the restaurant and a bakery.    When you enter Kohinoor, it's a no fuss kind of place so don't be afraid and seat yourself.  You will be entertained by the big screen television showing one of many interesting Indian soap operas or movies.  Don't be surprised if you are surrounded by a few Indian families, or students because they know good Indian food, and to me that says Kohinoor is the best!  Your server will soon be around with a pitcher of water and two menus for you.  One is the traditional menu you see at most places, appetizers, etc.  The other is your ticket to a great meal...a yellow, single sided, laminated menu with their \"specials\".  Unless you are ordering an appetizer, stick with the yellow menu.  It's divided into Vegetarian, Chicken, and Lamb dinners, all with about 8 or 9 options...$3.99, $4.99, and $5.99 respectively!  These are no small dinners either people!  These dinners include the main dish, jasmine rice, naan, a lentil side, a chickpea side, and yogurt!  For $1 more you can add a mango lassi.  For dessert you are welcome to request one of the many items from the bakery, but there will be more than enough food with your meal to fill you up, so be sure to bring your appetite!!  When you are done gorging yourself and have had enough of the day's feature soap opera, just head up to the cashier and tell them what you had, pay, and you are done!  I guarantee you will have some of the best Indian food ever, at THE best price ever, leaving stuffed and happy!  You'll never want to pay $40 for an Indian meal again!"}
{"text":"2nd time here with some co-workers.  We got a certificate from Living Social for the lunch Buffet.  The cost was $6.25 each.  It was well worth it.  Lots of choices on the buffet and the food was good."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet. Very small selection of items. Food was not that great. It's cheap though."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for Indian food! During the last two years of college I lived right up the street from here - those were the days! Their korma is the best I have ever tasted and they will substitute the meat for vegetables like peas, cauliflower, and potatoes. You get good sized portions whether you dine in or take out.  They also pay attention to the spice level you ask for - I always ask for mild and have always been pleased.  Family owned, always friendly and always accommodating. I'm craving it right now!"}
{"text":"Another day another Indian buffet and this one is pretty good! Came on a Groupon deal so total cost for 4 of us was only 32! They have a wide selection of foods (about 20 in total) with 8 meat items, 7 veggie dishes, and a number of desserts such as mango/rice pudding.   I enjoyed the goat curry, chicken masala, chicken tandoori as well as the vegetable samosa that they served. They're all seasoned well and pleasing to the pallette. They also bring out fresh garlic naan to the tables and the owners are very sweet and very attentive to customers. I would definitely come back for my Indian fix!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the food. Although, my opinion might not matter because I've never had Indian food before. There's more to a restaurant than the flavor of the food, and this place fails in every other category. Customer service is very important , and when the service is lacking, it cancels out the tasty food. I was brought to this restaurant by a restaurants.com voucher that gave me 10 dollars off a purchase of 20 dollars.   I informed the owner/host about this as soon as I got to the restaurant and I could tell right away that the owner had a problem with me using a coupon. He said that I could eat one buffet there and take 1 to go to make my total 20 dollars. So I enjoyed my meal while I was there. Even though the place was dark and seemed dirty, the food was delicious. When the time came for me to get my to go box and pay , the owner starting to have an attitude. He reluctantly gave me a to go box , not by handing it to me, but by placing the box on the counter and avoiding eye contact. I got a normal meal sized amount of food , but when he weighed it he claimed that it equaled 20 dollars worth of food , bringing my bill up to 30 dollars for two plates that should have been 10 dollars each. I thought I was going to spend 20 dollars and get 10 dollars off my purchase  per my coupon, but the owner ended up rigging my order to total a whole 10 dollars more than it should have. He acted like he didn't understand how the coupon worked , even though it was HIS business that offered the special . Then , after I paid he THREW my debit card at me and walked away. I still left a tip, and hopefully it went to his nice employee who consistently refilled my water and made sure I had everything I needed to enjoy my meal. If the owner was smart he would know that deals and specials bring new customers in , and it's the quality of service received that determines if they will return. I won't be returning to this business based on the poor customer service. It's really a shame because the food was good. There are plenty other options in the area for Indian food , there's no reason to dine at Kohinoor if they treat their customers so poorly."}
{"text":"We love this place! Not only is it a delicious lunch buffet, but it is an equally yummy dinner buffet as well! Fat chance finding a dinner buffet for the same price as lunch.  The sweetest people are here to make sure your meal is flawless and truly appreciate your business.  Be sure to stop by and check it out.  You won't be sorry. Be sure to try some of the sweets on your way out."}
{"text":"We came around noon and was surprised to see it empty. A few groups came after 1230 but it was nice to have first dibs on the buffet. They had two sections split by vegetarian options and meat options. I tried everything on the veg side, which had white rice, veg rice, paneer (cheese), aloo (potatoes), daal (lentils), chick peas, spicy eggplant, veg samosas and palak paneer (spinach). They provided us with garlic naan at our table which was so good. We ordered mango lassis and both enjoyed them, not too thick with rich mango flavor. The owner was nice and told me that their lunch card special they offer is a better deal than the restaurant.com certificate I had (which is how I found out about the place and why I came to try it). It's $10/person normally for a lunch buffet. Not sure if the discount card is a one time deal or what, but it states lunch buffet is $8 and dinner is $9 with a free drink.   I was pleased with the dish selections but nothing really stood out to me besides the samosa and naan. I'm glad I came to try it though."}
{"text":"Good: - Service, very friendly owners - Snacks and sweets - fresh and to die for - Decor  OK: - Price - Taste - not so great, but not bad - Samosas - the filling inside is just boiled potatoes, not spiced correctly - Parking is very limited  Bad: - Food quality - Freshness (seems like reheated food)"}
{"text":"I love the food here. I used a Groupon, which was 8 buffet meals for 8 bucks, with the purchase of a drink. It was a super great deal. In my perspective, Indian food is really heavy, so im glad that I got the chance to sit and take my time, as well as eat as much as I want. The chicken tikka marsala is great. It is my favorite, and the only thing I eat at indian restaurant, so I think i have a good idea of the differences between good and bad chicken tikka marsala. The chicken is very well marinated and tender. The service can be improved from my perspective. ..my water was not refilled once during the whole time I was there. Also, I feel like they did not have a good attitude towards me and my friend. I am not sure why though. Other than the service (and how warm it was inside - I was sweating while eating), I would come back (using the Groupon for the great deal course)! Tip: come during the evening - less people and a lot of food"}
{"text":"The family that runs this place is so nice! It turns out they have been in this location almost 3 decades. I didn't even know they existed. For the price ($12 dinner buffet), the food is terrific! The buffet has plenty of vegetarian options, and they're very conscientious if you have food allergies; just ask. It's not fancy, but it certainly is good."}
{"text":"This is a family owned restaurant and very welcoming. Paul and his wife are super nice people and constantly check up on you. There was quite a selection to choose from. Their chicken rice was SOOO GOOD!! The palak paneer was tasty and the naan was serve fluffy and warm. It's honestly very homemade and SO GOOD. They do make a nice and sweet mango lassi. They do turn it up on the spice level but luckily for me, there are mild options to chose from as well. Definitely a place to try for sure!!"}
{"text":"Sweet Child O' Mine this was gooood!!! --sorry, that song has been stuck in my head since driving over to check out this restaurant. I've kind of gotten out of the habit of checking groupon after a few not so good experiences, but this deal was too great to pass up. 14 bucks for two dinner buffets? Sure!! My husband and I have been on a quest to find an Indian buffet with some actual heat--we found it!!!!  At first glance, total hole in the wall in a weird part of Tempe. But that was totally part of its charm. We walked in, were seated promptly and ordered our usual Haywards beer and mango lassi. Pretty solid lassi, though I have had better. But the gem of this place was the buffet. Not huge, not glamorous but the flavors made up for it's appearance. Three flavors of Byrani rice, all aromatic and a nice addition to the saucy dishes. Though I do wish they offered other proteins besides chicken, the Marsala, tandoori, korma and curry were all perfectly spiced and delicious. They don't Americanize the spice which was refreshing--yes I love having to wipe my nose during my meal! The vegetarian options were great too, but the star was the samosas. I usually am not fond of them since they are usually quite brand, but even the damn pastry was spicy! The flaky crust melted in my mouth and the potato and veggie filling was smooth and buttery. I was also very impressed with their dessert collection, but blown away by their dessert counter of freshly made Indian candies and sweets you could order to take home. I have no clue what the hell anything was, but this milk and nut bar thing they had was divine! It was sticky and sweet and I totally bought enough to last a week to with my coffee.   The owner introduced himself to us on our way out. They've been open since 1988, and I found it sad that he was trying to get us to come back by explaining they were family owned and make everything fresh. The food spoke for itself. Next time I will order off the menu and try more. But I'm sure he was concerned that it was pretty empty. So I'm doing my part to spread the word--this place is a diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Indian buffet. Naan is included in the price, $10.99 per person for dinner, not bad. Selection is limited and they're not good at refilling it, but what they did have was excellent. Wished they had more food options available or at least refilled the empty pans."}
{"text":"Worst food in Tempe and Phoenix. Every dish has bad oil, bad taste and every thing is bad. No idea how this got 4 star review. Also they charged $27 for two people for this junk food. We didn't eat at all. Staff is obviously rude and weird."}
{"text":"Went here on the recommendation of an Enterprise rent-a-car employee when I was dropping off a rental...she said it was awesome, but she obviously doesn't know good indian!   I had the worst stomach-ache ever after eating here. Seriously, the ONLY time I have EVER thought I might throw up after eating a meal!  I was the only person eating here at about 6:00 PM for buffet, if that says anything.   Selection was poor, but tasted OK. Waiter/owner suggested an Indian beer (I had never had one) and turned out to cost like $18 (yes it was an oversize bottle, but still!)  There was a bug in my cup of water also...  India Oven in Mesa is SO much better and still worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Really impressed with the selection on this Indian buffet.  It's rare to find Tikka Masala right next to a Makhani.  Not only that, but the buffet is available for dinner.  Also, the mango lassi (not included in the buffet) was exquisite (if not a bit on the small side).  The only thing that keeps this place from getting a fifth star is that you can get better tasting versions of the dishes offered on the buffet from other, non-dinner buffet Indian restaurants.  That's my one complaint.  Overall, I was very impressed and will be coming back here next time I've got a hankering for Indian."}
{"text":"I guess if you're not Indian this place is alright. There is a huge problem though with this place, it tries to be both a vegetarian and 'American' restaurant at the same time. What i mean by that, is that they try to be vegetarian and 'American', by trying to serve meat dishes. I really don't think this works well.  This is probably one of the few places you can get authentic Indian desserts that are freshly prepared. I guess that makes this place pretty cool in my books. Nothing beats the stuff you can get in LA (Artesia, on Pioneer Blvd). However, for Phoenix, this is probably the best stuff.  The veggie and meat dishes? Well, they aren't too bad, its a little pricey but still good value. I tried one dish, and it was just TOO spicy, even for my Indian mouth, and it was just FULL of jalapenos.  The service is also weird. I've gotten desserts from them a few times, and they charge by the pound. Sketchy stuff going on during the weighing and stuff, I'll leave it at that. Don't fall for the owners trick of 'remembering' you.  All I can say is try it out. You may or may not like it."}
{"text":"Lunch and dinner buffet! While the food isn't the greatest, the value and service can't be beat. We went here on a Friday night to indulge in an endless supply of Indian favorites. Some of the selections included chicken korma, chicken tikka masala, goat curry, dal, and baingan bharta. Some of the chicken dishes were off seasoning-wise. One was too salty, while another was too sweet. I was also surprised to see beef on the menu for the buffet. I tried some but was disappointed that the beef meatballs were reheated from a frozen food company.   A nice perk here is the freshly made naan to go with your meal.   Desserts included gulab jamun, mango pudding, and kheer (rice pudding).   Service was good and drinks were refilled as needed. The owner at the check out counter was very friendly and we had no problem redeeming a Groupon that we bought.  We'll definitely be returning for the dinner buffet."}
{"text":"I'm a normal white 20 year old guy. Never tried Indian food in my life and was pretty apprehensive about it. Walked in and was treated to great service. And to my pleasant surprise, the food was delicious. Some of the best food I've ever had in Tempe. All around amazing restaurant, I'll be back often."}
{"text":"I am still in the process of finishing my food...however, I couldn't wait to give this place a review. I ordered the tandoori dinner plus extra rice and naan (very cheap for additional rice and naan) and lamb karahi plus vegetable samosas. The tandoori dinner doesn't quite specify what the sides are although I'm positive one of the sides were butter chicken and it's hands down one of the best butter chickens out there!   I will be coming back to this place for the rest of the week while I am here, if time allows.  I LOVE Indian food (and eat it every chance I get) and this place is definitely authentic. Very robust and complex flavors; I recommend this to anybody wanting to try delicous (and greasy!) Indian food. The owners are very friendly as well and although the restaurant is on the smalller side and in a somewhat unglamorous location, the main appeal is the food and homely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Have had the buffet three times now and I am amazed that each time was equally delicious. Have brought  friends and we all agree its the best Indian food that we have had. The tandoori chicken is delicious and its whole meaty pieces. The chicken Korma is one of my favorites of the meat entrees and love the  paneer and there are a number of vegetarian entrees as well .  The desserts are also lovely and they have flavorful rice pudding, mango pudding and a number of unusual treats to try........ Also food was served fairly hot which was really a plus when you consider how many restaurants do not keep their buffets hot enough,  I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Had been to this place a couple of times just bcoz it's near to my workplace. Not impressed at all. Average food. All items appeared same with same taste. Was really excited to try their sweets but seriously disappointed. The only thing to mention is their samosas which are so... yummy. It's better than many other Indian places though. I can see myself coming back for samosas. The service on the other hand is good. If u really want some quality Indian sweets go to new India bazaar in phoenix instead."}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet.  Great selection, great quality, wonderful service.  Quiet, relaxed atmosphere, and you can't beat the buffet price ($7.99).  Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and Indian buffet. Good selection of food and great tasting, good price and very good service  Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Thank you for your reply. But take this review as  constructive criticism & not something to find fault with your restaurant.  I really don't care if you mop the floor or not or serve leftovers as I will not be your Customer ever again. When we entered you had no Customers at all, But the Biriyani in your rice cooker was barely enough for 2 people. So if it was made for dinner, I wonder why it was just some scrapingss at the bottom only?  It's not the number of years you are in business that counts, it is how happy your customers are that's important.  Yes, I didn't purchase the Groupon because the lady I spoke to at the restaurant earlier that evening told me she would give all 3 of us the 50% off & free drinks & I needn't purchase a Groupon. You keep mentioning the free drinks, but let me make it clear it was ONLY 1 can of sprite. Maybe it cost you $1. No one had a drink except me. My Husband wanted a coffee, but he decided not to have it. Yes you did come & ask me about the meal. What did you want me to say? That all the food was bland? Would you have made all the dishes back again for me? Really?  I think you should take a review as something good for you to improve on & apologies to a customer & end it there. We pay much more for food. $20 means nothing. It's just the policy. You don't promise something & then do something else when we get there. You just keep talking about a 50% discount (which I am entitled to anyway if I did purchase the Groupon,  but I was told I don't need to purchase it) & just 1 can of Sprite."}
{"text":"I tried it twice, but I take issue with the fact that it opened right across from Copper Kettle. I went, so I obviously didn't take that much issue with the competition. What it came down to was this: It's about a buck cheaper, and you taste it. Perhaps the sweets are delish, I cannot say I tried them, but the rice was crunchy, which seemed too basic a mistake. The whole meal was similar to Tastee Bite pre-packaged entrees, if you are familliar. Same price, too. : )"}
{"text":"I'm a North Indian and know the North Indian food very well. So In short, Horrible location, Horrible Food, Horrible Ambience.  I can say it for sure that everything was stale !!!"}
{"text":"Lazy scumbags don't answer their phone. Really frustrating when you just landed and was trying to place a takeout order. Gave up after several calls well over an hour prior to their published closing time."}
{"text":"Always hot and fresh. Best Indian food I have ever had.  Chicken Korma is my favorite, with the Tikka Masala a close second. Save some of the sauce from each to put on your Somosa. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Sweets are horrible! I used to buy sweets before but the quality has declined super bad!. It is much much dirtier than before."}
{"text":"I went here once or twice, but there are so many better places. The food does not look fresh and we decided to no longer return ..."}
{"text":"Walking In I immediately felt like walking out . considering the amount of space given it was doing alright at packing the tables in all the way to the bathroom!  Very dark and at the time, was made into a loud playground for one large family! The first woman who recognized our existence looked very confused as if she didn't expect anyone else for the afternoon. The water server kept staring at his phone but looked up long enough to give another blank, confused gaze. When we finished the unwelcoming self seating process,  nobody offered food or drinks , we looked around and eventually went for a plate. A couple good choices but very little variety. My favorite dish had its own sign but nothing was there in its place. Nobody was speaking to us so I asked the \"waiter \" if the palak paneer would be returning ,he looked really scared and said \"I don't know what you are saying\" Returning to the table the two of us had six cups , only two filled but never got asked about other drinks. Zero ice anywhere! So great for a 112 degree day! I finally went to the front and asked for sprite and the same retard said \" I don't know... they might have it\" if only it were because of him not knowing English. We were speaking pretty loudly to each other over the yelling children. As for the food quality, I genuinely enjoyed only one dish. All the meat was terrible and nothing was warm at all. At least the hot water is labeled on the wall of the bathroom for you! Our used plates continued to pile up at the edge of the table and with our many cups already were very low on space. Once the entire experience was already a joke to my sister and I we looked around for signs of a drink refill or even some over room temperature water but there weren't any,  good thing we brought so much from home. When we paid at the front knowing the tip didn't exist,  the man actually suggested we put our change in the tip jar. Wowzer. Good one freak!"}
{"text":"Samosas were really good.. Tandoori chicken was OK and desserts were not that good.. Decent Indian restaurants"}
{"text":"The food is decent, and I like that there is a buffet for dinner. The dishes were tasty but not amazing. The buffet includes samosas and dessert.  Do not go here for the ambiance. It's in a really crappy strip mall, and the inside is not better than the outside. The TV is blaring the news, so it is not a relaxing place to eat. The place doesn't seem super clean, and the door was left open even when it was cold."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, one of the better currys I've had in America. Service and ambiance fine, you know what you are going to get when you pull up outside the strip mall.  Update: been for a second time since, food was better, not sure if we caught it on an off day the first time."}
{"text":"I'm lucky we stumbled upon this place. It's kind of hard to see from the street, but its in the same plaza as Hungry Howies, if you're lost and reading this like we were. We were heading to Haji-baba down the street but it was closed so we Yelped and settled on Kohinoor, and boy am I glad we did. The food here is no doubt the best Indian food I've ever had from an Indian buffet.   First off, Kohinoor offers quite a bit more variety than most Indian buffets I've been to. Besides the usual chicken curry, vindaloo, paneer, etc. they also offer chicken korma, chicken makhani, and a few other different dishes on the buffet that I've found usually reserved for ordering off the menu. Their tikka masala and makhani are excellent! The masala is actually spicy (like its supposed to be), and the makhani has a really rich, roasted pepper flavor with some almost smokey accents. The korma was also very good, nice and creamy!   Kohinoor also offers a wider variety of just about everything, including vegetarian dishes and dessert dishes. Their samosas are some of the best I've bad in a long time. Just perfectly fried, and they have a great spicy kick to them. The only thing I wasn't excited about was their biryani, but it definitely seems like their specialty is the rich, flavorful sauces they cook up for all the other dishes and I can respect that.   Overall, I'd definitely give Kohinoor another visit, especially given how affordable it is. The dinner buffet was $10 a person, and they gave us a coupon! 2 for $16. They also have a pretty decent selection of alcohol, including a bunch of beer from India. It's very good for what it is, knocking it out of the park as buffets go. The ambiance is also great, with Indian television playing in the background. I think we were watching some Indian version of The Voice or something similar. I'd recommend you check it out, especially if you've never had Indian before. This would be a good place to start."}
{"text":"Like others have posted, we had a terrible experience with a Groupon. We ordered the lunch buffet. We said we would be fine with water, but the owner came up and said that a drink is included. So, my friend I got a drink. When we went to pay for the lunch, it turns out we were charged something like $2.50 each for an iced tea. We said, \"I thought this was included.\" The owner, who is very rude, said \"you need to read the Groupon fine print! It's very specific.\" We felt completely ripped off--not because of the Groupon, but because the owner told us one thing  (drinks are included), and then charged us for them. It felt very deceptive. There are much better places to eat good Indian food. I recommend staying away from this place. The food is just mediocre anyways."}
{"text":"I thought by looking at the outside that it was going to be one of those restaurants that cook their food with love. I was so wrong.  None of the curries taste like curry. It all taste like chicken and gravy. Very BLAND. After one lunch buffet round we decided to wrap up our visit and the lady at the register wouldn't honor our restaurants.com voucher so we end up paying cash after she snatched my phone out of my hand a threatened to call the police... Her attitude was terrible.  Now we're stuck with vouchers for a place we would NEVER EVER go to again. It's a good place for a ASU student looking for a cheap eat. But you definitely get what you pay for here   Just a heads up they pour everyone's flat sodas from 2 liter bottles and a beer cost more then the buffet.... TERRIBLE FOOD AND SERVICE"}
{"text":"Decent Food. Nothing great but if your nearby and are craving Indian food.... The service was average, the place was clean tidy and empty!"}
{"text":"I've hit just about every Indian buffet in town, and they've felt it!  Was in Tempe and hit Kohinoor Cuisine of India. From the outside I was expecting a lot, but boy was I surprised.   I had the very inexpensive buffet for dinner and it was excellent. There wasn't one thing that was \"just ok\", everything was very good and tasted fresh. Something you don't always find on buffets.   The owner was very nice and came by with Tandoori Chicken that was right out of the oven, smothered in onions and peppers, and served each table individually. It was out of this world great. The best I've ever had. It was very moist and flavorful, instead of dry as I usually find it at other places.  I will definitely go back and suggest you try Kohinoor Cuisine of India."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and service was terrible. The server didn't say anything and filled up our drinks once. The clerk was down right rude. Also the naan was very firm."}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon (two buffets for $12). Let me start by saying the food was good, HOWEVER, imagine my surprise when we gave the cashier the groupon and we were charged an additional $5.50. When I asked what the charge was for, he pointed to a very small line hidden in the middle of the terms and conditions that says \"you must purchase a food item\". I asked isn't the buffet the food item? Cashier flat out tells me \"No, its the way they get back the price of the groupon, next time you are better off purchasing the buffet here directly- at least we give you a free soda with it\".  So without an ADDITIONAL food purchase (it's a buffet! What additional food do I need???) they charge you $5.50. I won't be back here just on principal."}
{"text":"It's all about the food, right?  Then this place is all right!!  The food was delicious, service professional, friendly and attentive.  I wish I lived closer.  I'd eat here all the time."}
{"text":"I love this place. It doesn't look like much but they make excellent indian food from scratch. They will do any substitution you need and ask for. If you eat there rather than getting your food to go you will get very generous portions for a decent price. They also have wide selection of indian desserts and snacks, most of which are made fresh daily.  It's family owned, if you are nice to them they will be very nice and helpful to you!"}
{"text":"Wonderful flavors of all their selections for the buffet. It's always nice to have an available buffet to try new types of foods. The items weren't sacrificed with flavor.  There was even a Groupon that makes it very (very) economical."}
{"text":"Got the incredible Groupon of dinner buffet at $5 each person. Figured we couldn't go wrong, even if it wasn't great. Well, have no fear. It's one of the most extensive Indian buffets (and at dinner!) that I may ever had. Some 20 oz beers to go along, made it a great time. And the owner was incredibly courteous and accommodating for the four of us, too. My only wish - as a non-meat eater, I would have loved a fish dish along with the vegetarian (and some fully vegan) dishes.Now it will be my go to place when going to Tempe and worth the 25 minute drive even without an excuse."}
{"text":"Ambience: Interiors are neat & clean. Exterior is like old restaurant. What it means, if you are trying to impress someone not recommended.    Service: Good service, hot naan served as soon as it was ordered. Wait time less than 5min. Recommendation, soiled plates to be removed immediately.   Price: Average 14$ per person. Similar to veg buffet prices in most of in town restaurants. (Ordered buffet for four, special order of garlic naan, 3 coke & Indian tea).  Food: Naan: Was Good, can be better by adding little more garlic and making it crispy or well done.  We ordered veg buffet, it included 6 curries, snack, plain rice.   Taste: Simple and tasty food. Not very greasy or spicy. It's more like how you find in Indian home.   Overall:  Will I visit this restaurant again? yes only with family.   Will I order for party? Probably not because it tastes like simple, tasty home made food and nothing special which i can bring to party.   Will I visit this place with guests? Not sure, as there are other good restaurants in town which are close to shopping places."}
{"text":"Years ago, you can eat at Kohinoor pretty reasonably with a Groupon, which has conditions such as you have to order one separate food item such as dessert or drink, in addition to your buffet.  But at some time in the last 2 years, Kohinoor eliminated any other meat, other than chicken, even at their dinner buffet.  No lamb, goat or beef, just chicken.  Buffet does not include drink.  Kohinoor's Indian beer for $10 for 22 oz costs $2 more than India oven $8 for same bottle.   Now (Aug 2017) their  Groupon is asking you to pay more than you used to pay, for less discount.   So now you only get about 33% discount, pay $16 for $24 value for two, when before you got 50%, but the requirement to buy one food item has always been the same.  Also, the lady answering the Kohinoor phone, can be very rude, sometimes.  Now I go to India Oven because for the same price for dinner $11.95, IO has both goat AND lamb dishes, as well as chicken, in their dinner buffet.  AND India Oven has free chai and mango lassi which can cost $2.50 - $4 for one glass at other Indian restaurants.  The goat at India Oven is soooooo good!  But other than IO has red meats, and Kohinoor only chicken in their buffets, to me, their other selections are very similar in taste."}
{"text":"I've been going to Bihlu and Kusums restaurant for over 25 years. The original location was at about 52nd McDowell(it was a treat after squaw peak hike with da)( but they have been at the current location for probably the last 20 years. They have a good mix of North Indian and South Indian food. Masala dosas have always been one of my favorites things to get. The vegies and sambar are always fresh as well. The title may not say it here but they are just as famous for all the amazing sweets they make as well. Indians from all over town order it by the tray but if you arent sure what you want to order ask them to sample it. Jalebi barfi and laddu are some of my go to's. I'm an american born and raised indian so I'm suggesting some of the more tame whitewashed options. The service is quick and the staff is always attentive. You'll see an crowd of ASU kids definitely during cricket matches but they also have indian music videos playing throughout the day. Before I forget my favorite thing to get from there to go is pani puri!. Picture a cracker like hollow bubble with potatoes chickpeas and a spicy sauce. yes my mouth is watering just describing it. I put in mint chutney and tamardind chutney. Im confident you have will a few items that you love and will have again and again."}
{"text":"For a buffet this place was so good. Super friendly service, beautiful place and spicy Indian food. Good price too"}
{"text":"Bets buffet in the valley in my opinion. We all know buffets can be a little scary but to my surprise, this place was an absolute delight. All the food was enjoyable and the service was on point, constantly refilling my water and bussing my dirty dishes. The only complaint I have is the decor and look of the place. Very old and rundown looking, could use a refurbishment to make the place seem more welcoming and appealing. A regular bystander would most likely run from this place form how it looks on the outside but give it a chance!"}
{"text":"Indian buffet for $10. Although you may like the sound of this, the food is mediocre. Samosa was good. Veggies and chicken dishes were ok and below average. For an Indian buffet, there are not many options compared to what I've seen in other places but again its just 10 bucks. Naan is good. Sweet and dessert are below par, like down to gulab-jamun-was-crunchy level. All in all, it was hmm ok and you will eat bellyful of Indian for cheap but its not as good as other Indian restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Kohinoor is one of the few places that I have seen that actually serve dinner buffets.  They have a large variety of options, which is great.  The naan is fresh and toasty right out of the oven, and the food is well seasoned across the board.  The owner was really nice to me and gave me some extra sweets to go as a trial for my first time.  Unlike most buffets that have 1-2 common desserts, they have quite a variety of choices if you are into Indian Sweets.  The people working are extremely nice and have a great sense of humor as well."}
