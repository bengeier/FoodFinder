{"text":"The Shaler Lounge has a new name and a new owner.  The 412 Bar and Grille.
Many of the old favorites are still on the menu, but new ones have been added.  The new owner really has himself invested in making this place succeed and assisted our waitress in waiting on us.  The food was very good and the service was quick.  The staff friendly and engaging.  If you have not been here before,  what is nice is the layout,  there is a bar area for dancing, eating, and drinking.  then a back room which you can fully see into the bar, if you want a slightly quieter experience, and also a side room, which is like a traditional quiet dinning area, with no view of the bar or other room, complete with a mantle and electric fireplace.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Stopped there for an early dinner. Menu has a wide variety of appetizers, a number of featured burgers, wings with quite a few sauce options, and some upscale meals including cod stuffed with crabmeat. Their special was a strip steak with baked potato plus soup or salad for $12.95. One of the soup options was cheese tortellini which sounded intriguing, but I wasn't ready for a multi-course meal.

Decor is pretty nondescript but clean and neat. Radio plays softly from overhead speakers. We got provolone sticks for an appetizer, she got chicken quesadillas and I had the \"giant fish sandwich\" with fries. The provolone sticks were served with homemade marinara which was quite tasty.  

She liked the quesadillas and the serving was pretty large. The giant fish sandwich was as advertised - giant. The bun was very nice and held up to the end without crumbling to bits or letting my fingers poke through. Fries were good. Everything was cooked right. 

There was only one other party in the dining room (this was around 4 PM) so there was no issues with service. Our waitress was friendly and while I tend to cringe when a server doesn't write down your order, she got it exactly right - no sour cream on the quesadillas, and lettuce and tartar on the fish. 

Prices are very reasonable and I think next time I'll try one of the burgers."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in here since there was new ownership and am really sorry we did. My wife ordered a pepperoni pizza that was honestly abysmal. The crust tasted and looked like a poor attempt at homemade pizza dough that was never put in the fridge to proof. My 2 year old daughter who loves pizza spit it out. I ordered the 412 burger which was supposed to have a fried egg, cole slaw, and French fries on it. When the burger came it had a really over cooked egg and onion rings on it. I honestly don't understand how you can name a burger after the new name of the restaurant and then make it wrong. The burger itself wasn't seasoned and was a total disappointment. The prices that are being charged are far too high for the cheaply made food that is being served. There are far better local restaurants where your money will go much further and leave you way more satisfied."}
