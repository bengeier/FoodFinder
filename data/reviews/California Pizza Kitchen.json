{"text":"Worst service ever.  We went in to eat at 4pm on a Sunday and there were only a few tables and about 8 waitstaff so we should have had perfect service.  Instead the staff stood around gossiping and we never got drink refills and waited forever for our check.  On top of that we were very unimpressed with the food.  My boyfriend had a salad that was $18.50 and the corn in it looked old and his salmon way over cooked."}
{"text":"The service could have been better, they messed up at least two out of four orders when I ate there. We got conflicting answers from the service staff. The atmosphere appeared hectic. The waitstaff could have been better trained.

Yes, it's an airport with the prices, so I didn't feel bad to ask for things that were forgotten the first time around."}
{"text":"Liked the appetizers better than the Pizza. A little overrated. Quite expensive for the portion size."}
{"text":"Wasn't happy with this particular CPK. Our waitress seemed to \"hate her job\" too much. For me, personally, service is the most important thing you can offer...and this lady was NOT offering good service. Also, when I tell my hometown CPK to \"make my food spicy\", they actually take the effort to do so. These guys just put whole red peppers in it....I mean...even a baby could've done that. 

If you're craving CPK, there are other ones in Vegas...avoid the Mirage one."}
{"text":"Back for dinner with family from overseas ..this time better choice  always loved the convenience of this one ..after long shopping day this perfect place to stop. Service always First Class!"}
{"text":"Sigh.

CPK. I've probably had every item on the menu here (don't look at me funny - it was one of two dining options at my old job). So even though I haven't been to a ton of CPK's, I feel like I know the place pretty well. And this one is probably one of the the worst ones.

As the other reviewers have said, service here is crazy slow - not necessarily the service staff's fault - this is a busy CPK, for sure. But my was it bad. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad, dressing on the side. My friends got their food, finished it, and yet my salad still never arrived. I tried to flag down the waitress (took a while), and asked her about my salad. Next time she appeared, it was 10 or 15 minutes later, with the salad. Though the lettuce was drowning in dressing (not exactly dressing on the side, eh). The service was so bad and so slow, I didn't want to send it back because I'd probably miss my flight by the time my food made its way back to me. Sad face."}
{"text":"I love this place!! This is where I go for a quick lunch. They have good food for a good price. 
The only reason why I gave this a 4 stars because they took out my 2 favorite dishes out of the menu and they changed the recipe to Wild Mushroom Pizza."}
{"text":"Me and my friends went for the 3 for $32 deal for Valentine's. Everything was really good! The salad was huge (thumbs up for that) the pizza was very well done and the dessert was amazing. I also got the Sparragus and arugula salad OMG thats a must! Our server was very nice, he took good care of us :) coming back next week for sure"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst locations that I have ever been to, 
Today I sat at the bar on my hour lunch break from work and Emmy waiter was aj at the bar
You would think that placing your order right when you sit down would cut some time, but I guess that did the opposite, 20 minutes had passed and I still hadn't received any bread like I asked for which was \"being baked in the oven\" but because I was seated at the bar I could see that there was nothing but pizzas being made in the oven,
20 more minutes had passed and my food and the food of the guest that I was with was still nowhere to be found
So I ask aj to make the order to go because at this point I have to start making my way back to work so I'm not late, 
I was than told that cheese was accidentally put on my order which I asked for without so they would take only a few more minutes to make,
I could see the cook in the back proceed to remove the asparagus and spinach and tomato with cheese off of the top of my pasta and put fresh vegetables on top of it, and was than handed to me. I told them I can't eat this because cheese had already touched my order and I picked up my things and got out of there as fast as I could, because why would ANYONE give business to a company that doesn't respect food sensitivity or dietary needs!

AVOID THIS CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN AT ALL COSTS UNLESS YOURE CONTENT WITH DISAPPOINTMENT"}
{"text":"Sometimes when in a Casino you need a quick meal and CPK is the perfect place for that! Salads and pizza are always amazing. The Thai Crunch salad is my go to dish, don't forget to add Shrimp!!"}
{"text":"If you're at the Fashion Show Mall (most likely there for the Apple Store) and start to feel hunger pains, try this CPK.  You can't go wrong with almost any one of their pizza dishes and you should definitely order it with the honey wheat crust.  They have a pretty decent selection of salads so if you're lame and anti-carb, you'll still leave with a full stomach.  I'm not a particularly huge humus fan, actually I think the stuff is pretty gross, but I was forced to try their warm humus appetizer and my taste buds didn't completely hate me for it.  I don't know if I would order it on my own, but if you like humus to begin with, you'd probably totally dig theirs.  The only thing to be wary of at this CPK is other patrons.  Remember, you are in Las Vegas on the strip so you will encounter both tourists and residents.  People who live there are too cool to bother you, but some out of town tourists may interrupt an otherwise delightful meal.  For example, myself and two other girls were sitting there enjoying some conversation with our meal and a nicely dressed older Asian woman approached the table, basically standing right on top of me.  She then proceeded to stick her face about a foot from each of our dishes as though examining them, for what, I don't know.  After about a minute (which doesn't seem long but when you have no idea who the person is and you can feel them breathing on you, it's close to eternity) she proceeded to another table and did the same thing.  No words, no smile, no nod, no nothing.  So while you can expect some good food from this CPK, I can't tell you what to expect from the crazies."}
{"text":"Average pizza. Jo gave great service.  Food came quickly. Would try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and never had California Pizza. The ambiance was fresh and clean. The waiter and kitchen manager Rafael were very nice. We were awestruck when the kitchen manager Rafael gave us a free complimentary appetizer. Wow. What a rarity these days. The appetizer and pizza were great. The pizza was unique. We had the California club pizza. What is amazing about California Pizza is the experimentation of what we call Pizza. If you are looking for a unique pizza dining experience this is one to have. Not your same old pizza. 

Thanks to the wait staff, chefs, and Rafael for giving us a wonderful dining experience. Can't wait to try a different pizza. :-) Rose"}
{"text":"Don't order the sandwich or side salad. It was gross. Note to self if you go to a pizza lace order the pizza. Service is not even good."}
{"text":"Where to begin. The food was not up to CPK standard... anyone from corporate reading this? The kitchen sent out  2 orders of Chicken Tequila Lime Fettuccini with pasta so poorly cooked that it was hard, clumpy, and a little crunchy. We sent it back because an $18.75 plate of pasta should be cooked correctly. We waited an extra 20 minutes for a new plate. We spoke to the manager who brought out the new plates to us, however not once did he check in with us to see how everything was. The second plate wasn't much better than the first. The service was sub-par, and management wasn't concerned. My advice is to spend your money elsewhere., it was not worth it - not even an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Went here for gluten free pizza but sadly they don't have it. The only gluten free options are salads."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was good.  Liked that they had valet parking cause the wether was horrible."}
{"text":"KEEP YOUR RECEIPT! 
I ate a soup (market veggie) and a pizza (California veggie) on January 3 2017 at 11.30am. If you look at the menu at that location, you'll see that soup costs just over ten and pizza just over twenty. With tax and tip my meal came out close to forty. I'm fine with that - food was hot and tasted great.

What bewildered me when I got home is a charge I found on my card - just over eighty dollars (transaction number 531553336330 5812 from Piz30400154). So I thought it's a mistake, I'll be nice and call them and they'll fix it. 

I called the location directly at 7022617317, nobody picked up, left a voicemail, nobody called me back (now it's 2 weeks).

I called the CPK headquarters at 800-91-wecare (92117). No, they don't care - nobody picked up nor returned my voicemail. 

Now I called my bank, who said \"do you have a receipt? No? Sorry, then you can't dispute this charge.\" 

Lesson of the story: keep your receipts."}
{"text":"Food was very good as well as service.  Manager was friendly and overall great experience.   Delicious spinach and artichoke dip as well as BBQ pizza."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've ever had. Located inside the Mirage so it's a little hard to find. 
Very nice decor and you can see all the sports book screens of the casino if you're into that.
The pizza was amazing -- I had tomato basil. Very generous portions. 
We went for lunch and had no trouble getting a table. 
Wait-staff was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"A great place to eat, watch a sporting event."}
{"text":"The food is beyond amazing here. But the reason why I truly gave this place 5 stars (and I wish I could give more than 5) was because of the employees and customer service. I ordered take out from this place ($220 worth of food) and they had forgotten one item. I called CPK after unloading everything at home and the manager picked up and was extremely sorry about the situation. I went back to CPK to get the food, and the manager gave me a gift card for the inconvenience. Very helpful service and even though they had made a mistake, they handled it accordingly and extremely professional. 12/10 satisfied"}
{"text":"CPK is a chain restaurant, but I still find it yummy! I went to the Legacy Village restaurant this month and ordered the vegetarian Smashed Pea & Barley Soup...yum!  I split a Salad Pizza with a friend and we still had half the pizza to take home.  I find the prices reasonable, service good and the menu is huge. Everyone can find a meal here."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant at 9:45pm on a Thursday night.  Pizza was good but service was slow, allow plenty of time to order, receive your food  and eat your meal prior to your flight.  I would eat at this California Pizza Kitchen again but only of if I am at least 45 minutes prior to boarding my flight anything less you might be eating on the run."}
{"text":"I think I'm only giving it 2 stars because it was the only sit down restaurant I could find in the airport.  Other than that, the menu was small and didn't contain my favorite CPK dishes and the food I actually got was pretty blah.  I think for quality I would have been better off with one of those prepackaged salads you find at the kiosks than the disgusting pasta I had.  Luckily the hummus and pita appetizer was pretty good and the glass of wine I ordered ended up being over two glasses worth. So I wasn't starving and the buzz allowed me to still smile at the waitress."}
{"text":"First time eating here and It was amazing! Fast and friendly service. No wait for our food. As soon as we ordered the food was brought to our table. Great portions as well. That's what I call good service!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed stopping in CPK to have their delicious salads, or pita and hummus appetizers. The last server we had was not having a good day and I understand we all have been there before, but I'd much prefer a more positive atmosphere, especially when I'm eating. I decided to give it another chance and order something to go. Absolutely never again! The service was awful. I asked where to go to pick up my order and was talked down to because Clearly I was \"bothering\" her. The server at the bar that asked about my order spoke very low and with a tone of malcontent. No thank you."}
{"text":"Pros:
Great variety
Great for vegetarians
Quality food with neat ambience

Neutral:
Chain restaurant feel
Waiting time can be long"}
{"text":"If say not too bad. Especially for airport food. Had a few goose island IPAs and made my flight much more enjoyable. Bartenders were pretty friendly and I'm pretty sure that one of them plays Andre on \"the league\"

{"text":"We went here before going to the Love show. We got there about 5 and the doors opened for our show at 6:30 and started at 7. We waited in line for about 30 minutes. Now 5:30. Then we got drinks (water!) 5:45. Ordered. 5:45. Got appetizer foccocia bread 6:20. Got pizza 6:40. Shoveled our food in got check. And barely got to the show with 5 minutes to spare. This was even with letting the waitress know we were in a hurry. Horrible service!!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night with a couple of friends.  We had an excellent meal and our waitress was great!
I had the tostada pizza and absolutely loved it!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Both, their pizzas and their extended menu (continuously improving!) are of impeccable quality, their seasonal dishes comparable (if not better) with any choice Italian/Mediterranean restaurant. The wine/beer selection is more than adequate. The service is fast and courteous, one definitely feels the personal attention. And all that along very convenient prices!"}
{"text":"I love it here me n my group came here their times and love the Kung pao chicken and the pizza"}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid restaurant for me. The service is decent and the food is good. My favorites are the mango mango mojito and the pesto cream penne pasta. The only downside is that the music on the sound system can be a little loud at times, which can make it hard to talk."}
{"text":"Waited almost an hour (with a kid) nobody really cares. This is last time that i visit And they keep telling another 30min. Bye CPK"}
{"text":"We ate at CPK, twice, within four days.  The first time was excellent...great service, great food!  The second time...slow service, but it got better as time went on.  The food was excellent, both times!"}
{"text":"this place has good food, but the service is always hit and miss. tonight the service was so slow. 
i probably will not be back"}
{"text":"Pretty good location, close to yogurt land for a treat. 
It does get a little crowded inside though. You might feel like your eating with the family next to you. 

Food is pretty good, service is average."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza crust was horrible.  Ate the toppings and left the rest.  Service was incredibly slow and lacked overall.  Would not recommend and will not be going back."}
{"text":"We ordered food to go. To make a long story short, we ended up waiting almost an hour and a half for our food. They lost part of our order so we had to wait for them to complete our order.   Then they got some of the orders wrong. Due to waiting some of our food was cold and dry. I got pizza and it tasted like it was a day old!  No apologies were given. You would think that the service would be better for what they charge. Or maybe the service for food to go isn't there because a server is not being tipped. It was very disappointing and it seemed like they didnt care."}
{"text":"Food was good the service well not so much almost seemed like we we a bother. He did not really seem like he wanted to be there. Very much in a hurry."}
{"text":"Cob Salad, California Club Pizza and this was first meal at California Pizza kitchen. Our server provided a complimentary white corn avocado dip for being first timers. The portion sizes were excellent and the food quality was excellent. 

The service deserves an extra Star .  Thankyou!  Manager was always checking and thanking us for being customers. 

Keep up The Excellent Work!"}
{"text":"Amazing Amazing AMazing. Had amazing spagetti.. Loved it. Some chinese style spicy spagetti.. Plus Chicken BBq Pizza was also great. Yes CPK is expensive. Got a bill of 50 for two but every penny spent was worth it. Plus love the service by Rachel. I think she is amazing in recomending the best out of menu and really friendly, Would visit CPK again for sure... MUst try.."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited 15 minutes on the patio portion of the restaurant only to have a waitress stand 50 feet away in another room, shake her head at us, and walk away without saying anything to our table of 3. All we wanted to do was sit out on the patio while we ate so we could watch the planes takeoff and land.

We decided to walk up to the front of the restaurant again, but to only be scolded at by the same waitress. We kindly told her that we didn't understand the head shake she gave us earlier, but big mistake - she responded by saying \"if people would get up and talk to me I could tell them!\" and went on about how understaffed they were, that we were being impatient, and (the cherry on top) \"do you want to sit down or not?!\".

We finally get seated inside and received our water 30 minutes later. I will give this other waitress credit though - all of the other bartenders/waitresses/waiters were sitting at the bar on their phones. Another 20 minutes went by and one of my friends had to leave to catch his flight. Another 20 minutes after that, we were finally able to order.

After we ordered our pizza, the waitress came back out and said that they are not making that pizza anymore (even though it was labeled as a CPK favorite?) so we had to choose another one.

Fast forward another 20 minutes and our pizza finally comes out. It took a whopping hour and a half (at the very least) to get one mediocre pizza and water for two people.


TL;DR if you have two hours to kill, don't mind spending $18 on a small pizza, and poor service, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I needed lunch in a hurry and this was the right choice. I had an asparagus and arugula salad as well as a bowl of smashed pea soup. 

I was seated right away y a courteous and attentive wait staff member who took my order right away. The manager, Ester, came over to greet me. She gave me her card and a discount card for my next visit. 

My food arrives quickly. The salad was a lovely medley of textures and flavors. The arugula was freshly torn, asparagus in crispy bite sizes, generous Parmesan ribbons, crunchy almonds and chewy sun dried tomatoes. All topped with a delicately seasoned vinaigrette. 

The smashed pea soup had chunks of carrots and hearty barley. A cozy, warm lunch addition. 

I recommend a visit."}
{"text":"The environment is great and I came with my family of 4 and we were able to get seated right away at 5 pm on a Saturday. The food was good and it was an easy night out with the kids. The music was loud enough so when when they were a little loud it wasn't interrupting anyone."}
{"text":"Ate here before seeing Terry Fator. This is my first time eating at this chain. I was NOT impressed. Freschetta FROZEN pizza tasted better than this place. The prices were ridiculous. For the same price I would rather go to Settebello's. They are the BEST pizza in town! Save your money and forgo California Pizza Kitchen."}
{"text":"It's CPK right? Basically yes it is. We ordered a chopped chicken salad (if memory serves) and the Pear Gorgonzola Pizza. Being only two of us this was more than enough to split and the salad was decent. The pizza was a nice light meal but had some good flavor and overall the experience was satisfying. The line can get long so timing is everything."}
{"text":"The prices are the same, but the pizza is totally different.  I ordered the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza which I usually order when I go to CPK.  The pizza taste like it was from my high school cafeteria.  The cheese was rubbery, the pepperoni was burnt, and the sausage tasted 5 days old.  Don't eat here expecting normal CPK quality food."}
{"text":"CPK is always consistent and much better food than Antofagasta the other national chains."}
{"text":"This is for the location inside of the Mirage. I havent been on Yelp in a few to write reviews, so this review is from mid-Sept. The main reason I am giving this 3 stars is because of the service or lack of decent service inside the Mirage. 

As always, CPK is good and I havent had a bad pizza yet. On this visit, I had the Jerk Pizza without onions and peppers, and it was great. Price was a little high, but again it was in the Mirage. Everyone else was satisfied with the food.

The server ended up getting on pizza wrong brought out a pasta dish. It took about 10 minutes for the pizza to come back out when everyone was close to half way done. There was no half off or other comp for the mistake. The other issue was is that I paid for everyones pizza with my CC, and noticed it seemed high but didnt think anything of it. When checking the final bill which was lower, the server actually added the pasta dish and charged me but had it removed."}
{"text":"The Chicken Milanese was amazing. I've been going here awhile now, the service is always superb. Avocado rolls are awesome too!!!"}
{"text":"Best food ever they have something for vegetarians, vegans, and carnivores. They service is great the food does not take long at all! the food is also great tasting. Overall this is a fantastic place and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Met a work colleague here for a late dinner. Objective: A place in the Fashion Show Mall with a decent list of wines by the glass and somewhat healthy fare. We had originally planned to dine at Nordstrom Cafe (a fave) but they closed earlier than CPK, which delivered beautifully.  Nice atmosphere and OK service, although I had to stalk our server a bit for H20.  The miso salad (I do the half with shrimp, dressing on side, no crispy rice sticks) is my fave of the salads here. It's fabulous and inventive.  The $5-ish small bite appetizers aren't much of a \"deal\" because the portions are so tiny - but while I usually get scandalized when something that seems like a value isn't, I was OK in this case.  We shared a meditteranean combo ap and it proved to be a great way to distract me from the bread basket."}
{"text":"Well my husband and I stayed at the hotel so we had dinner at this place.
The hostess was super rude, she was almost shouting \"HOW MANY\" when we entered, no hello no smile. I surely don't expect much but being polite is part of her job. The place filled up pretty quick and since we had the table by the entrance we had people so close to our table waiting that it was truly uncomfortable to eat while starring at other people's butts. They have to change this system for sure. There were probably only 3 waiters for this whole place and they worked hard and tried to be as fast as possible to serve all their tables. Meanwhile the manager was literally walking in circles (the restaurant is shaped like one) so he was making his rounds whthout helping his struggling staff, stopping by the hostesses table to check his phone a few times and keep on walking. I'm not sure if he doesnt know what his actual job is as a manager but it drove me crazy because I work in hospitality and only a good manager keeps a restaurant great, I just felt really sorry for all the servers...
The food was good by the way but service adds a lot to a restaurant experience!!"}
{"text":"Why change things up?  No more Tri Color Pizza and they changed the Passion Fruit iced tea.   Agh!!!"}
{"text":"This was a nice, affordable option to have on the Strip.  Food was good and service was great in the bar area.  It's in a great area for those gamblers who just want to take a quick break from the tables/slots."}
{"text":"It was so not good. Not even okay. After getting into Vegas I was starving I and wanted something edible; we ordered the margarita pizza and it was so bad. It was burnt and had some funky weird taste to it, like chemicals or something. And the service was sooooo slow."}
{"text":"Well worth the long wait.

I went to Vegas for the first time this year and I had to try out their California Pizza Kitchen on the strip (Las Vegas Boulevard). There were tons of families and couples and groups lined up. I was there with 3 friends. We waited about a half hour.

Once seated the service was prompt. I shared the white pizza with a friend and it was really good. My other two friends shared BBQ chicken with applewood smoked bacon pizza, which was delicious. For dessert we shared CPK's mouthwatering butter cake with a scoop of Haagan Daaz. 

Good food. Good service. Good times."}
{"text":"California Pizza Kitchen is a restaurant in which I've never had a bad experience at. This location, in Legacy Village, is the only location in Greater Cleveland. The restaurant itself is very expansive, with a few tables outside facing the green and a modern bar in which you can dine at and watch the food being cook, as the kitchen is fully visible. If you only have up to three people with you, even kids, I recommend the counter, as you get the same service, again, kid friendly, and you don't have to wait unless the bar is full. There is often a wait for a table, as this is one of Legacy Village's most popular restaurants. The food is outstanding. You are given complimentary bread and butter as you wait for your food. You can select from soup, salad, pizza, pasta, sandwiches, and a few specialties. The appetizers are great too. The most recent time I was there I had the Cajun pizza. It was excellent. It was spicy, but not too spicy, as the spicy andouille sausage was complemented by the sweet bell peppers, as well as the onions. Their crust is outstanding. It alone is worth the drive. Overall, if you're looking to go somewhere laid back and fun, head over to CPK, no matter where you are in the Cleveland area. Note: The whole restaurant is very kid friendly."}
{"text":"They have a wide variety of pizzas with numerous toppings. The two times I have been there I have not had a problem in getting a seat. The service is good and the ambience is more up scale than your average pizza place. If you are looking for a pretty good pizza place then CPK is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Poor and slow service! Not worth it go elsewhere! Normally service and food are good, this one is clearly poorly managed! Doesn't do any good to have a loyalty program if staff is clueless and mgmt is, too!"}
{"text":"It took 15 minutes for the wait person to come and take my order. It took another 15 minutes for the wait person to bring my ice tea. After that it took another 15 minutes to get my pizza. Then she brings me pasta and I tell her that's not what I ordered and she said yes it is. It wasn't even crowed so what's the deal. The person sitting next to me wanted to talk to the manager but they were not anywhere to be found either. I wanted to get another iced tea but didn't want to miss my flight. So it was 45 minutes just to get my pizza. Sheesh!"}
{"text":"We ate here at the fashion mall . From the wait staff to the mgr...it was awesome. Great food . Everything fresh way to go mgr kellylas Vegas California kitchen rocks !!!

And one meterianian  the pizzas were sasusge mushroom with basil  we chased it with the Carmel pudding and sea salt  desert  hubby order a bourbon lemonade again everything was fresh. The mgr Kelly even compt us one of our deserts . We were shocked"}
{"text":"A friend and I went here on a weekday around 4 pm. We sat on the \"patio\" which is inside. The waitress wasn't overly nice or helpful. We ordered  the mini tacos for an appetizer and a BBQ Chicken and apple wood  bacon pizza. We would have ordered another if they would have told us they were small but the waitress didn't bother.  They brought us a pizza missing the bacon. We ate it assuming it was under the cheese but no. They realized they had made a mistake and rather than coming to apologize and getting us the correct pizza the waitress brought us the bill saying that they didn't charge us for the bacon!  So they took off a dollar something.  The food was great but the service sub par."}
{"text":"Bad experience, placed my order simple breakfast and 45 minutes later i was still waiting. Apparently they forgot to make it"}
{"text":"worst service EVER. Sat outside in the patio and the music was blaring, asked to have it turned down multiple times and was never done. Place was empty but it still took 20 mins to get our drinks over 40 minutes to get our food. Very disappointed because usually very happy with CPK and it's one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Absolutely poor service! Went to eat at 11:15pm and figured we had plenty of time to sit and eat before they close at 12am. We apparently entered in at the \"ToGo\" side. We were directed to the \"Real\" enterance, where we waited for over 10mins while no one acknowledged us. Finally (after a line of people had started) we were told tonight the restaurant is now closed (11:30pm). I told them we have been waiting for quit some time. The manager then said, \"I guess you could order \"ToGo\". At this point, no thanks. I guess they need to update their signs with their current made up times. So, my wife and I and the other groups had to find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"The food is so overpriced...Pasta only. No bread. No salad....AND the hostess and server called my husband and I guys throughout our time there."}
{"text":"California Pizza Kitchen is a solid chain restaurant when you're looking for good pizza at a reasonable price and in a laid-back environment. Kid-friendly and their outdoor seating is nice - overlooking the courtyard at Legacy Village, which makes for great people-watching during dinner. During the summer - usually Friday nights - various bands perform in the courtyard area, so if you're lucky to snag a seat outside, you get to hear live music, too. 

Pizza is quite tasty. The California Club is our favorite - shredded romaine lightly tossed in mayo, topped with apple-smoked bacon, sliced roma tomatoes and avocado. Also like the sesame ginger dumplings filled with chicken and served with this awesome soy-ginger chili sauce. I love the sauce so much, I found myself dipping the bread they give into the sauce to savor every last drop! I don't know how they do it - each time we get those wontons, they're steamed so perfectly and so soft. (of course, took pics of the food)

The Legacy location offers Curbside Service. It's set up to be a convenient service - just call ahead and place your order (tell them if you'll be paying cash or credit) and let them know what kind of car you drive (this is the perfect time to tell them that you can be found in the yellow Ferarri), then make your way to one of their designated Curbside Pickup parking spots (at Legacy, they're located outside Stir Crazy - you'll see a camera on top of the building). We've tried this service twice now, even arriving slightly after the time they told us and both times we've waited over 10 minutes for them to come out with our food. Seems to sort of defeat the convenience of the service, knowing that it would only take me a few minutes to run in, pay and pick up my order. So, we may not try this again. I would say it might be convenient if you had kids, but the last time we noticed a woman in the car next to us, two small kids in the backseat, frustrated and clearly calling CPK to find out where her order was."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Salads ok. Pizzas good. Came here after terrible service by surly staff at Stir Crazy."}
{"text":"Great place - Thai crunchy salad was awesome. The service was not that great, the server did not let us know about the additional costs that we were incurred."}
{"text":"The food is not nearly as good as a typical CPK. The crust is a thin quick-bake substitute for CPK's traditional crust. My pizza tastes microwaved and the toppings are flavorless. Go to Chili's Too around the corner, it's a huge improvement over this place."}
{"text":"Its been so long since I been to California Kitchen, the pizza's were very tasteful. I forgot how good this place was will be back soon."}
{"text":"Have never eaten inside. Ordered online for curbside pick up and they hadn't even gotten my order at the Val Vista location - until I pulled up. I placed the order in the morning for a 4 pm pick up. THEY HAD HOURS TO GET IT  and I even called to confirm because I was using a gift card. Waited 10 minutes. They came out to say it would be another 10 minutes. Very polite about it so I can not say this service is bad. However the pizza was awful. Crust was so tough and chewy. For the $56 including tax..... for 4 - what I would call PERSONAL SIZE OR SMALL pizzas you have to be kidding. Pizza out from now - Venezia's. Far better quality and larger pizzas for the money."}
{"text":"Nice friendly service.  At the top of her lungs, my 4 year old niece exclaims \"I can't have red sauce, I have reflux,\" when our waiter came to get our drink order.  

Our hummus was wonderful. The tomatoes were put \"on the side\" for the safety of my niece.  I really enjoyed the pear and gorgonzola pizza with a little salad right on top. My niece barely touched her \"doctored\" hawaiian pizza with white sauce.  But it was very tastey reheated the next day. =)~ /wink.

Nice menu, kid friendly."}
{"text":"We had \"reservations\" at 7:00 pm on Sunday night for a big group due to 2 bdays, when we arrive we were told in not a \"reservation\" is just putting your name to the list so we said ok, how long?
The young lady running the door quoted us 20 minutes, at 7:30 we checked back and were told is almost ready, 7:45 comes around and still no table.
A manager kept coming up with excuses on how it was just a quoted time not an actual reservation and the table was almost ready.
After asking again the manager said we will have to split you up and I will send some apps to the table but again he said is going to be a few more minutes, at 8:00 pm very frustrated and hungry we left to go to Brio where they sat us with in  5 minutes and had Drinks, bread and water in less the 10 minutes.
CPK: untrained hostesses (how can you miss your quote by almost an hour) a complete disaster...Brio big thumbs up!!!!
By the way no one apologize or try to keep the group there as they saw us all walk out"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times.  The food is outstanding and the owner is awesome.  He stopped by our table and found out we had never been there before.  We talked dishes and appetizers.  Then, he surprised us with 2 free appetizers.  He said, once you see that all the food is good, I know you'll be back.   How call is that!  Fyi-- food was and is great!"}
{"text":"Worst Cpk experience ever! And I would know, I used to work at one so I know the drill. Ordered my food and drink, that was fine. Food... Just ehh. But whatever that's what I expected, I was just killing time before my flight. The service is what really got me. Server did not ask how my meal was, and I had to flag her down to order another drink because she didn't notice me sitting there for 20 minutes with an empty one. Next time I'm going to Cinnabon!"}
{"text":"I was blown away by CPK's amazing lunch menu.  The food was all fantastic, from baked potato soup, quinoa salad and 7\" original BBQ Chicken or margarita pizza, to the red wine flight.  This place has really turned the corner and it's good enough to be a true destination - not just a reliable chain you hit while shopping.  Fantastic service too.  A real gem in the rough - or, in this case, at Legacy Village."}
{"text":"I really like CPK ordinarily.  This is not CPK.  Food is bad.  Service is bad.  Bartender even said he didn't know how to change the TV station.  This is Crappy Poop Kitchen."}
{"text":"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! SAVE YOURSEL THE HASSL. 
So disappointed, I am a regular customer at CPK and was excited that there was one in our airport... But that turned around very fast. They really shouldn't even be called cpk, there are so many restrictions on their menu and drink list, the customer service sucks and if I hadn't sat down I would have walked right out. The food is awful and tastes like its microwaved. All of their food is pre packaged and reheated on site."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night, which the restaurant wasn't busy at all the hostess asked us if it was our first time there and we answered yes. So as the evening continued we sit down and are waiting for the server to come for our drink order for about 15 minutes, but never showed up, but instead a manager comes and brings us a flat bread for it being our first time eating there and it will be my last time as well. Finally the server comes about 5 minutes after the flatbread arrived and takes our drink order and it takes another 10 minutes for him to return with our drinks (which we ordered two waters) and the rest of the night continues like this. So I will never return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"this was by far the worst pizza I have had in a long time. It was basically a frozen cheese pizza that they added extra toppings on to as you ordered.  It was stale, only kinda warm and well pretty much sucked.  I know it's an airport, but I have had wolfgang pucks pizza at the chicago airport and its decent.  the thing that i like about chains is i usally know what im getting, but this was horrible.  Ill go back to cpk probbaly just not in an airport."}
{"text":"The food was great/I suppose I should say standard and I really liked the waitress. We were making jokes and that was pleasant. It's a Thursday evening and I'm here as my flight is delayed to try and enjoy the cubs game. It was really the hostess that made it unpleasant for me. She first did not believe my id when I asked to sit at the bar. I am 26 so felt this was ridiculous. I asked to sit at a booth after instead of a table and she said I was making it so hard for her, she also came back to my table and just expressed her tiredness. If I do sound a bit upset I am as I've never been treated this way before at any restaurant. One good note is that just the waitress was great but it had spurred me into wanting to create more just  reviews on yelp as it's an awesome community. Also, I ordered the sausage poblano flatbread, great portion size for one sitting a little poblano heavy in my opinion but it's never bad to have more than less in yummy peppers. :)"}
{"text":"I go to CPK quite often, because I simply love their food!

SERVICE: varies from good to bad

Their service here seems to vary from terrible, crap service to good service on every visit.  Even when I came on a Tuesday afternoon when the restaurant wasn't at all busy, I received bad service.  That day, we were promptly seated and ordered immediately, but waited a whole hour for our two (simple) dishes: Garlic Cream Fettuccine. We called another server over and told her that we ordered an hour ago and our waitress was MIA.  Turns out, the waitress didn't put in our orders and totally forgot about us,  The manager did come by and our meals were on the house so that made up for the bad waitress's mistake. At that point, I decided to order their Tuscan Hummus appetizer to-go since my meal was free.  The waitress forgot to bring that out to me, too. -_- And this isn't even my worst experience from CPK! To be fair, most of my visits were decent or good service-wise. 

- They don't take reservations on the weekend (inconvenient since they're really busy during the weekends!)


FOOD: DELICIOUS!

Tuscan hummus appetizer (Photo included)
I love hummus and their hummus appetizer is one of the best hummus dishes I've ever had!  The pita bread is soooo soft and the hummus is topped off with tomatoes, basil, parsley, and garlic. I ALWAYS lick the plate clean. I highly recommend this appetizer. 

Mediterranean Plate (Small cravings)
The small cravings section of the menu lists appetizer dishes for one person so their portions are quite small - just enough for one person like it implies. The overall taste is good and I would order it again.

Chipotle Chicken Pizza (Photo included)
VERY spicy, but omg tastes amazing! I don't even like spicy food, but I absolutely love this pizza. I tried it on a whim since my boyfriend ordered it and now I can't get enough of it. The size of the pizza is on the smaller size, but for the taste, it is worth every penny. I highly recommend this pizza, but I'd like to warn you that you might become completely addicted to it like me. lol 

Garlic Cream Fettuccine ($10)
Simple, but great pasta dish! I order the fettuccine on 80% of my visits to CPK.  I crave it often because it's just so tasty.  The prominent flavor comes from the garlic.  It's a pleasant dish to eat - not bursting with flavors, yet still very satisfying.

Baby Clam Linguine w/ Lemon Cream Sauce 
A little bit on the spicy side - this dish tastes very yummy overall. They weren't cheap about the amount of baby clams they put in the dish, which I was very happy with. Portions are pretty good!

Pineapple Pina Colada (non-alcoholic)
Their pina coladas comes without alcohol regularly, but you can ask them to put rum in it. Although it's a little expensive ($4.50), it's well-worth it.  The pina colada is presented beautifully in a somewhat large glass.  Instead of the usual slushie-type drink, CPK's version is much creamier. I'm addicted to it as I'm a huge fan of pina coladas - especially CPK's pina coladas.  (Photo included)

Raspberry Mango Pina colada (non-alcoholic)
I was really wowed at how beautiful this drink looked (Photo included). It tastes amazing! I could drink this everyday...


ATMOSPHERE

- clean restaurant and restrooms
- tweens frequently come here
- on the weekends, CPK is usually busy so noise level is high
- CPK seems like a family restaurant so it's not a very romantic place for dates, but Legacy Village is usually very nicely decorated and couples take a stroll around the balcony area or fountain often. After dining at CPK, couples can take a stroll around these areas.
- Good location: Legacy Village has many stores and as mentioned before, it's nicely decorated with a fountain and balcony area, which are good hang-out places. There's also beachwood mall a little further down Cedar.



I can't wait to come back here! :D"}
{"text":"Whenever I come to this location, it's packed! I've never had to wait longer than 15 mins. (we're usually a table of 2). I've been eating at CPK for about 9 years (started my addiction in the 6th grade when I was 12) and the food tastes the same. I don't eat here often, but I do like the: BBQ chicken pizza, BBQ chicken chopped salad, tequila chicken pasta, garlic cream fettucine with chicken, & hummus. They also make great Shirley Temples."}
{"text":"Food is aweful. How is this place still open. It's a nice building and service was fine. Concept is good. Food is just bad."}
{"text":"This CPK is the worst I have been to. I'd rather make the trek over to Chandler Fashion Center when I'm in the mood for CPK. My boyfriend had the Chicken Marsala which was a soy sauce ridden, weirdly Chinese-food-tasting, boxed noodle, cafeteria dish. Our waitress forgot the bread and brought over the wrong iced tea three times. I had a salad and we shared the artichoke appetizer. The total bill was $50."}
{"text":"We go to or order out from Califoria Pizza Kitchen at least once a week.  Yes, the price is a little on the high side ~ but we love the food.  There is such a wide variety of pizza, pasta and salads.  I LOVE having CPK in the east valley right on my way home.  9 out of 10 times we have had a good experience ~ sometimes you have to wait a little while ~ but hey that's means they are in demand.  Blessings to them ~ : ) KC"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in years but decided to give it a shot again. Went in, was seated immediately, then the wait began. After being ignored by 5 different servers attending to other tables next to us for over 15 minutes we walked out. They weren't even busy."}
{"text":"Met my wife for lunch here. We each ordered a bowl of soup and a half sandwich. With hardly anyone in the place we waited 25 minutes for our food. Actually I had to ask the waitress to bring the soup so we could begin eating. The soup, Pea Barley, was tasteless. It was hot and thick with no taste. Finally, the sandwiches arrived. My wife's, a crusty chicken, was cold inside. Apparently, the chicken is frozen and then sometimes cooked. There is nothing to say about mine, the turkey with brie, because there is nothing to say. This place takes no pride in their sandwiches, in fact, there are only four on the menu, variations of two chicken and two turkey. Our Ice Tea and Soda were $3 each. So, for this grand meal, the charge was $28 including tax. Apparently, if you go to a Pizza Kitchen, you'd better order pizza. Very unsatisfying lunch."}
{"text":"CPK has been a staple in my life since 1999 when I worked down the street from one in Palo Alto. Since then in have been addicted to the Chopped BBQ Chicken Salad. It's quite a pathetic addiction. So bad that I cannot bring myself to order ANYTHING else from the menu. Ever. We don't eat out a lot (amateur home chef here) so when we visit CPK I MUST enjoy my favorite. Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. 

Salad Ingredients:
Black Beans
Jicama
Tomatoes
Fresh crunchy romaine and iceberg lettuce
Corn
Crunchy Tortilla Strips
Cheese
Perfect amount of creamy ranch style dressing
BBQ Chicken pieces

I love that the salad is not overloaded with dressing and they toss it so the dressing is perfectly distributed.

As for other menu items, the Spinach Artichoke appetizer is excellent. My husband is a big fan of the Pear and Arugula Pizza and the Thai Chicken Pizza. I've tried both...yum.

This location in the Town Square shopping center. It's always busy but the service is very good. You can dine on the patio, they have a special entrance for take out. It's fun to sit a the bar and watch the cooks making pizzas."}
{"text":"I love CPK, but not this location. The service, while usually friendly (but sometimes not), is always bad. The food has always been consistent, within this location and with other locations, until tonight. I got something I get almost every time, and it was terrible. (The manager offered to take it off our bill.) my husband was concerned about the chili pepper garnish that he, thankfully, knew not to eat. The waiter saw our empty glasses and never refilled them. The girl who brought our good only refilled them because we asked."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow, but they have quality people on staff that try to go above and beyond when there are issues in the kitchen.  The Pulled Pork Habenero Pizza was the best thing on the menu.  Always a solid choice for the whole family."}
{"text":"Dropped by after checking in @ Mirage for quick bite.Not too many seated when we arrive,  so we got in quick,We were greated fairly prompt by server to take out drinks. We ordered a whole meat pizza and a lunch special which included a salad.  In all our bill came out to about $ 42,  which is in line w/Vegas prices."}
{"text":"I'm never a fan of this chain really. For the prices they charge you can get so much better somewhere else. But I was in an airport. And really hungry. So I went here, plus the airport had WiFi so it wasnt so bad. But yeah the food is all meh and the price is crap. Go to cheesecake factory if you are looking for the same prices but better food."}
{"text":"Flew back to Burbank on a Tuesday night a few weeks ago, and was craving a beer before my flight. Popped into CPK and was bowled over by the impressive customer service I received from my bartender Lu. She was attentive and personable, and truly cared about doing a great job. It's really nice to be served by someone who takes pride in what they do and cares to get to know their customer. I will be back next time!"}
{"text":"I used to like CPK and it has been a while since I had their food. We came here on a Friday night and it was a 25 minute wait.  As soon as we were seated we started to order. The menu was huge. They added a lot of things to the menu since the old days when this CPK was just getting its start. 

White corn guacamole and chips - very fresh flavorful appetizer. The corn was sweet and the avocado had a nice contrast to it. 

Crispy Artichoke hearts - I love artichoke hearts but these were too breaded and  it lost the flavor of the artichokes.

Blue crab cakes -  dense crab goodness but a bit too salty. The vegetables that came with it were awesome. 

Mushroom ravioli - very solid dish. quite awesome. 

Tiramisu and banana chocolate cake - very good desserts. 

The service was alright. The food was above average. decent prices."}
{"text":"I love town square and it was my first to this restaurant. I read previous review and decided to give it a shot. I started out with a Caesar salad which was fresh and crisp and then followed up with penne pesto pasta dish which was absolutely delicious. The dish was served really hot was full of flavor and was better than I have expected. The server who serving me was polite and prompt however I felt she was a bit pushy about the wine sales. I do drink wine however not with Italian dishes and really wasn't in the mood for a wine. Overall 4 star and recommend this place."}
{"text":"I did takeout and ordered the half portion BBQ Chicken Salad and Thai Chicken Tortilla Rolls all very good.  I love the CPK menu and like the atmosphere.  Their food and service has always been a good experience.  This location was a little hard to find if you are not familiar with the Legacy Village.  It is more in the middle of the Village instead of the outskirts.  But they have curbside parking.  I'm not sure where that is in the Village since I parked right outside their restaurant."}
{"text":"California pizza kitchen is wonderful! So many different kinds of pizza, dishes, drinks (fabulous wine), and great staff. This one is pretty fast compared to other one's I have been to. Good job you all! :)

My favorite pizza so far is the tostada pizza. Black beans, lime chicken(if you ask for it), tortilla strips, lettuce, and instead of tomato sauce you get a yummy ranch type sauce and it all is so good!! 

My favorite drink there is the red sangria. It is just right! This place puts lemon and lime in it and other places put an apple and orange in it, but either way it tickles the taste buds!"}
{"text":"The worst CPK. 
1. Overpriced pizza which are not even yummy. 
2. Careless waitress
3. No customer service at all
4. waited for 20 minutes for our waitress come to our table so we  can pay. 
5. There was no smile on anyone's face at the place.

Choose a different place to eat!"}
{"text":"Pizza is not good came out cold and the place is only half full of people  at most .Would not eat here"}
{"text":"Change planes 2 hour layover here, arrived 8 AM after 3 hour flight.  Got egg panini and coffee.  Good for airport food, generous portion. Happy it was here instead of burger king or other tasteless stuff. Coffee not strong, but not cardboard, acceptable taste. Was all real food."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza, dumplings, and a chocolate soufflé to go at the bar. We got our order quick, only a 10-15 minute wait. The food was packaged well, tasted great, and moderately priced. The only bad part was that we had a blue rubber band on top of our dumplings-probably from the scallions. I understand these things happen, but when you're serving food to the public you need to be sure you're paying attention to what you're serving."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to stop however just found out they don't do curbside anymore?? Little confused.  new policy??  I go everywhere with my dogs and I have a bad ankle so curbside is huge for me. Bummer"}
{"text":"Staying at the Mirage, we didn't feel like walking far after a day full of walking, so we stayed close and hit up California Pizza Kitchen.

As far as food goes, it was the same you can expect from CPK everywhere you go. I don't recall exactly what we got, but it was 2 pizzas. One was a white sauce with bacon and spinach, I believe. The other had chicken, avocados, and lettuce. Both were quite good, as expected.

The restaurant was pretty full, and the staff was definitely being pushed. They were still very friendly and helpful and didn't let the stress get to them, while still maintaining their sense of urgency. Great job!

It was a great dinner and I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Out of all the places my boyfriend and I ate at while we were staying in Las Vegas this was the best service and food wise. This California Pizza Kitchen is location within the Mirage hotel so it made it convenient as we were guests of the hotel.

The food came out fairly fast and they give you bread & butter to snack on while you wait. I ordered The Works pizza and my boyfriend ordered the Jambalaya pasta. My pizza was pretty self explanatory with various amounts of ingredients and was well made. My boyfriend's Jambalaya was pretty delicious as well, has the perfect amount of shrimp and chicken included and very well flavored.

If our waitress was busy and our drinks were empty another server would ask if we wanted refills. This location is on top on their service and it's always nice to visit a restaurant that works as a team. 

I would highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"It has to be difficult to mess up the CPK Sicilian, but this outlet absolutely butchered it.  It felt like eating shoe leather.  Whatever they used to make that pizza was very, very old, and stale, and miserable.   I was so optimistic going in, and so disappointed coming out.  Will not be eating at CPK ever again.  It was a good run for several years (not this location), but it's over now."}
{"text":"The bbq chicken pizza was pretty good and the crispy Mac and cheese was amazing.  The cilantro on the pizza was a nice touch.  I didn't give 5 stars because it felt like I waited forever for drink refills.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Worst location and worst server ever in my life. I have never encounter a rude and no personality server. Absolutely no customer service! BEN is his name! Tall older guy! Our food was ordered appropriately but he just kinda threw it in the table, no napkins, no water, we are the first customers here coz we arrived when they just opened so it's not busy at all!!! No reason to rush or be inappropriate, did not ask how wer doing I had to ask another server to give us napkins, extra sauce and small spoon!! and we have little kids! It was my birthday so I think my husband asked him to bring in cake with candle so me and the kids can blow it, not looking for free dessert coz we are stuffed on how much food we ordered! he just left the cake and lit it up and said \"here u go\" who does that! Usually the staff sings with ur family and wish u a happy bday! I mean that's what I see everytime somebody has a birthday to celebrate at the restaurant! Talked to Kelli manager, she was offering something to make it better! We refused! We have money to eat. We just deserved a good service considering I buy my kids Mac and cheese there every other week! So they can at least value me as a customer who spends hundreds of dollars to the restaurant so they can have jobs! MAnager was nice she knew there was something wrong so she approached us. I told her I don't want any troubles but our server just sucked! Will probably never go back here for my kids mac and cheese or any future pizza or other food! Worst experience ever! No star! And I'm still nice coz I still tip him!!! Regardless of the way we are treated!"}
{"text":"Seven adults & two children venture in after a long day of hiking for dinner service. Not only did it take long to put two tables together but our server was also serving six other tables at the same time. I think their management needs to get things in order & not let three server's stand around while only one is actually working."}
{"text":"The food was good.  I ordered a BBQ c chicken salad and my  cousin had a wardoff. There was jazz outside, which was nice."}
{"text":"I've had California Pizza Kitchen many times in my teenage and college years, so of course when I found out there was one at the Charlotte Airport, I made a beeline for it.  I was tired of the other food court restaurants in the center of the airport.

I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza (Duh! Signature CPK!) and a small SmartWater and that set me back almost $18 - yikes.  Airport prices for ya.

After a 10-15 minute wait, I finally got my pizza.  I took it with me to my gate so I could sit and eat in peace.  This was literally the worst pizza, let alone CPK, that I've ever had in my life.  The crust, or lack of crust, or bread, or whatever you want to call it, was reminiscent of stale flour tortilla with supermarket BBQ sauce and like a few pieces of chicken on top.  The best part of the pizza was probably the fresh basil they had on there.  I can't even begin to explain how hard it was to chew the pizza given it's strange, chewy texture.  I should have taken a cross-section of the pizza - it was literally as thin, or thinner, than a flour tortilla.  Maybe a half-cooked, 3 week old tortilla.

Save your money and eat at some other expensive airport restaurant.  And skip the $5 SmartWater."}
{"text":"Wow, never met a staff that would snap at you as much as this breakfast crew. Got sassed at by the host, snipped at by our waitress, and overheard a bit of a tiff with another. Not a great way to start the day.

Seeing as I don't eat eggs, it was also a very limited breakfast menu for me. 

Got a muffin & coffee. Should've just gone to Starbucks."}
{"text":"We almost didn't eat here because of the bad Yelp rating...fortunately all of the other airport restaurants had similar reviews so we took a chance.

We were greeted politely and seated quickly by the host. It was noon and the restaurant was maybe 70% full. Our very friendly server immediately took our drink orders. She got those to us  quickly then took our food orders. I went with the Sicilian pizza, my wife had penne. The wait for food felt \"normal\" but we had 3 hours to kill (don't go to a full service restaurant if your flight boards in 30 mins).

The food was good. It wasn't a culinary experience to die for, but it was fresh, looked appealing, and exceeded our Yelp-influenced low expectations.

Based on our experience, this place is better than it's Yelp rating indicates."}
{"text":"Located inside the Fashion Show Mall, had a very pleasant saturDATE here. We were seated immediately, our server named True was very nice and attentive, the food came out extremely quick and had an overall great dining experience! 

FOR HER: I ordered the KUNG PAO SPAGHETTI with shrimp. A yummy Chinese pasta spin with garlic, scallions, peanuts & red hot chilies -- came with 7 good sized shrimp and is filled with flavor!

FOR HIM: He got the ORIGINAL BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA, which has their legendary bbq sauce, smoked gouda, red onions, cilantro and chicken. Comes with six pieces -- which can be shared or devoured alone if you're that hungry! ;)"}
{"text":"It was not bad food or bad experience......but it was not \"wow\" either.
We have eaten here few times now.  
Wait time could be an issue depending on the day and time of the day that you go.
Yesterday there was no waiting and they accommodated our group with two baby strollers with ease.
Our server was also nice - came back to check couple times and was able to answer questions. 
Now the food - it was average.  Not bad, but not exceptional either.  After all it is a chain restaurant.  We had the Mediterranean spring rolls.... They were yummy, but overloaded with mozzarella cheese.  Could barely taste the caramelized onions or ....umm....exactly.  Could not tell what else was in there.
The spinach artichoke dip was good. No issues there.
We tried the tostada pizza. An innovative variation but for me it felt \"blah\". I would not order again.  This thin crust was so chewey, i felt like rubber.  The regular crust Cali veggies pizza was good. Crust was also normal (not extra chewey)
Its a place I go with a group .....not for the food but coz everyone else wanted to go there while we r in legacy village."}
{"text":"Decent food for late night snack after show. Wild mushroom puzza is mild tasting, carb-satisfying prata. Sedona tortilla soup is warm flavorful for the tummy. A good alternative option to burger & fries."}
{"text":"Idk if this is the one I ate at bc there were so many locations but this was on the stip, in one of the hotels, before you got down to the mall, if that helps at all. 

Anyhow, I heart CPK anyhow so my review is stricly on service. Server was very attentive, along with management who came by to check on us as well. No complaints, and glad we got there when we did, bc no sooner than we sat down it started getting crowded. overall good experience, and if you eat spinach get the spinach dip. Also the BBQ, Jerk, And buffalo pizzas are the BEST!"}
{"text":"i used to come here all the time. came back tonight for the first time in a while and the menu was vastly smaller and crazy overpriced. i ordered a waldorf chicken salad and it was fine until a found a dead fly in it. the service was horrible. the restaurant wasn't even busy and our waiter was unattentive. extremely disappointed and will absolutely not be coming back."}
{"text":"I met some former co-workers for lunch, and at their suggestion, we went to the Fashion Show Mall for a little pizza and conversation. Good timing by us, because CPK just started a lunch duos menu that fit our needs perfectly.

For $10.95, we each had a small pizza and side salad. I had a BBQ chicken pizza with a Mediterranean salad. My friends each had a California veggie pizza with a Caesar salad. They both really liked their pizzas, and I probably would have chosen that one, too, except I'm not a fan of broccoli. My pizza was fine and the salad was good. Although drinks are a little pricey ($2.95 for an iced tea), our server kept the refills coming, and the overall value for the meal was pretty good, especially when you consider we were dining in the tourist corridor.

The lunch duos menu also offers soups and sandwiches, so you really can't go wrong if you're shopping at the Fashion Show and want to stop for a bite."}
{"text":"Went for a quick breakfast before my flight home. Food took quite a while and the waitress was not very attentive.  Did not come back to check on us, did not see if we needed anything else and did not even say thank you.  She brought our food and brought our check.

The food was actually pretty good but because it took so long, I had to pack it to go.  I think for an airport eatery, service should be a little more efficient as people are looking for a quick bite before their flight.  

I actually loved the breakfast pizza and potatoes (later), but unfortunately could not recommend the service.  :("}
{"text":"We have visited twice now, and have not been disappointed.  The quality of the food is very good. We so far have tried the habanero carnitas pizza and the spicy chicken Chipotle pizza.  The second is by far our favorite. Another plus is they actually have Fresca as a soft drink drink, I have never seen at any restaurant.   Our server Keysha, was the best.  Friendly outgoing, made the dinner very enjoyable with her recommendations."}
{"text":"I took my fam bam there today and the price didn't match with how the food tasted. I ordered some sort of pasta and the only thing I like about it was the shrimp. 

All the pizza's are pretty standard. My nieces and nephews enjoyed them. The appetizers was pretty good as well. 

All that mattered was my kiddos had fun Eating there. Good fam spot. But wouldn't recommend going there for a date."}
{"text":"I have only done this CPK in the early mornings when I drag myself into McCarran Airport, so breakfasts are all I can review on. I know there are other airport options but I have a thing about carrying my food to a table along with luggage. Something tragic will happen, I know it. So as for a sit down restaurant (besides Ruby's) in this terminal, this is it folks!

I have always ordered the egg breakfast with toast, potatoes, sausage but I opt for egg whites instead. I am a Creature of habit. There is not much you can really do to mess up a breakfast like this or make it phenomenal since it is airport food. 

Now, they do serve Bloody Mary's so that has been my deciding factor between CPK and Ruby's across the way! Just sayin..."}
{"text":"I bought a sandwich here which turned out to be decent but the service here is horrendous.

They don't know how to control their lines so when I arrived there was a large crowd of people all trying to push their way to the front counter.  

Then after finally paying for my meal I find out they don't have any bags to carry my stuff.  This is very inconvenient!  

Not recommended unless it's empty and you're starving."}
{"text":"I had to wait for someone to decide to come to the register to take my order, then my breakfast pizza seemed to hard for them to understand.  I waited about 10 minutes (was thinking 4 stars at that point if the pizza was good).  Well, the pizza was excellent for the $7.98 I paid (sausage, bacon and egg).  Plenty of meat!!!  This would have been perfect for 2 people."}
{"text":"It's okay. I used to love their BBQ chicken salad but not really at this location. Something was lacking. I give it 3 stars for their salmon. Def yummy"}
{"text":"The California club pizza was delicious. Avocado as a topping.. Nice!"}
{"text":"October 6th 5pm Before shopping, I took a friend to CPK for his first time.  Austin, the manager, Ashley, our server were impeccable!  Even the host, who I wish I got his name was awesome too.  I had no clue that if it's your first time at CPK they welcome you in a wonderful way & bring you a complimentary Bianca Flatbread.  Austin also thanked me for bringing him in.  

I also ordered my fav Sicilian Pizza & tried the new Buffalo Cauliflower.  Both were delish, we had no room for the complimentary dessert, Austin also gave us.  My friend was thoroughly impressed & he can't wait to come back.  

A+ service & food!  Thank you chefs for consistently making your pizza's perfect also."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst experience I have had at a restaurant.  Waited 10 minutes for even a server to come take my drink order.  Paid $15 for a crappy breakfast.  

I will never eat at this California pizza kitchen again."}
{"text":"I decided to go to CPK just because I have passed it so many times and wanted to try it out. Also one of my friends misses it a lot!

We were there for lunch at 3 PM and it was mostly quiet. Most customers here were drinking beer and food was the second thing on their mind. I think that kind of took over the waiters too. They were quite slow. We were sitting outside and it took them 15 minutes to get water for us. The food arrived with some delay also. 

I would be lying if I say I did not like their food. Food was good, but it had that character to it, which is usually found in a chain restaurant. We ordered California veggie pizza, all the ingredients were fresh and delicious. The Mediterranean Focaccia was good. I would have loved to see some more character to their food.

At the end we had a feeling that there was nothing special in the food or experience. We were glad that our check was not more than what it would have been for a large pizza from Papa John's!"}
{"text":"Extremely rude customer service from their takeout server. The manager, however, apologized for his rudeness and comped our takeout order. We were 1 minute after closing and he gave us attitude and a temper tantrum in front of my kids."}
{"text":"Reliable, have most of the flavors you're craving, made w good ingredients.  Takes 7 to 10 min to make a pie, but they have some ready to go for people in a hurry like me.  best flavors: Thai Chicken and BBQ Chicken.  Wish their prices weren't so high.... But it is the airport.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This location has great atmosphere and perfect portions. The service was great and food was really good. Our server, Connor, provided a great experience for us! Recommended!"}
{"text":"Took my son to lunch at this location last week.  I tried the Thai peanut pizza.  It was pretty good but ended up eating more of my son's Chicken BBQ.  Both were okay, but lunch for 2 ended up costing me over $50 for 2 people... and we didn't even order dessert.  Too pricey for my taste!  Probably won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I was worried because I only had 30 min before I boarded.my flight...I ordered a Denver omelet to go and it was out in 10minutes!!! I guess I got lucky :) The D gates doesnt have many good choices for breakfast so ill definitely be returning on my next trip!"}
{"text":"I've been through many airports and always wondered if this was a good place. One day, I gave up and ate at an airport. I would have preferred starving another few hours... this expensive pizza tastes like a 4$ pizza at best."}
{"text":"My very first visit to CPK and its in an airport imagine that, I've tried the frozen version on several occasions from the grocery store so I was anxious to see if the fresh version was better. I don't know if the comparison is exactly fair since this breakfast pizza was served up with a very nice Bloody Mary so the review maybe a little skewed.

It was nice that this location was within a reasonable walk from my departure gate so I could enjoy the AM cocktail up to the very last minute and thanks to a great server at the bar I didn't have to wait on anything including my second breakfast drink. The restaurant was clean no clutter and plenty of good help. The food and drinks were delivered fast so if your thinking you don't have time just let your server know once you arrive and they seem to be expediting the ordered for those in a hurry.

Over-all a pretty positive experience , certainly good enough to visit them again if the situation presents itself.  Only negative is don't waste you're time ordering the potatoes wedges I tried one and it was meh at best."}
{"text":"$13+ for a tiny salad or a tiny lukewarm pizza, your choice! If you need a place to sit at the airport while you wait for your flight, make sure to linger for a while so you *might* feel like you got your money's worth. What a ripoff..."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I eat here at the Fashion Show Mall CPK, really bad service, food takes forever..
I love CPK, but this is the last time I eat here, 
I love Town Square  one though.
I'm a server myself, we earned our tips, this time my server barely made it.
If you want to experience a bad service come here..

{"text":"California pizza kitchen is my favorite pizza place. If you haven't tried it you must! It has so many unique pizzas to choose from. My favorite thing to eat is their thai style chicken pizza. I also like the barbeque pizza. They also bring out some bread as an appetizer which is nice. Sometimes you have to ask for it if you go by yourself though. Also, you absolutely must try the buttercake with icescream. For being a pizza place they have awesome desserts! If you haven't ate here you must. Not to mention it is conveniently located in the mall so you can eat pizza after a long afternoon of shopping. Otherwise, I have nothing bad to say and give it a try if you haven't ate it here."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizzas, and very fresh salads, make this a nice place to eat.  It won't break the bank either.  I like the thin crust pizzas the best, so give them a try if you haven't, you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, we had the bq chix pizza. Not too pricey, but the pizzas are kind of small."}
{"text":"Too pricey for what you get, then again it's Vegas. The salad was real good, forgot what it was called tho. Pizza was alright, nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Ordered a spiced moroccan salad. It was delicious!

Also loved our server Chad. He was great!"}
{"text":"cpk airport, don't go there if you can avoid it!!!  i  ordered the romain salad, mostly yellow and stalel  lettuce and too much dressing, not eatble and i had to pay over $10 + tax........place was dirty!!!!!"}
{"text":"It had been a while since I'd been to CPK as my husband hates it. Regardless I had (notice the past tense) always loved CPK, especially their hummus and pita bread. Last night it was pouring rain out here in Mesa, I had gotten back late from the dog groomer, so it was going to be a \"go out for dinner\" night or an \"order something from somewhere and pick it up\" night. My husband opted for Panda (not my fav) and since he was going to Dana Park, I picked CPK.

When I looked at their online menu, I noted that some things had changed. Gone was the pasta with portabella mushrooms that I had always loved. I think it was some type of ravioli dish. The hummus offered also seemed different, but truly it's been a couple years since I've been in there, so I wasn't sure.

I just looked at the menu and didn't realize the prices of things aren't on there. What is this trend? Since when does anyone look at a menu and not want to see the prices. It's bad enough when the fancy-schmancy restaurants (mostly in Scottsdale) do this, but this is CPK for crying out loud. I had been to my Italian lesson and I wanted some pasta...I should have just gotten some from my teacher...she's a great cook. Anyway, I ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese, the Fried Mac & Cheese Appetizer, and of course, the hummus. I knew I would just eat a little bit of each and have plenty for the day after and probably the next day too.

When my husband got home he said, \"next time you order from them, you might want to think twice about it...the bill was over $26.00.\" From CPK? For crying out loud, I could have gone to Olive Garden for probably less than that, and if not, at least I would have gotten unlimited breadsticks and their fabulous salad.

But here's the rub...the hummus which came in an individual dish was maybe 1/16th of an inch thick. If I had bothered to take all six slices of pita bread and had spread the hummus over the tops of all of them, I think I would have had enough hummus for three slices. RIDICULOUS, people. My Spaghetti Bolognese was icy cold (which was helped by the microwave), but there was no sauce...there was only cold liquid. Granted it had stuff in it, but when you order sauce you expect sauce. I did get a kick out of whoever was taking the order when I pronounced Bolognese correctly (Bo-lan-yay-say) and he corrected me and pronounced it (bo-lo-nee-see), but that's just me being an Italian language snob now that I'm learning it. I didn't correct him. 

The Fried Mac & Cheese was good but not knowing how much any of this cost, I am pretty sure it wasn't worth whatever my husband had to pay.

All in all, I won't go back to my fav CPK for the delicious hummus. Plain truth is, I won't go back at all."}
{"text":"Food was good. A little greasy. Service was quick. There wasn't a line and the cashier was friendly. Seating area was a little cramped and awkwardly laid out."}
{"text":"The first time I tried CPK and it was out in Vegas in the Mirage Hotel & Casino! haha  I went during brunch time with my best friend while the boys were in a poker tournament. The pizza was delicious! I order the buffalo chicken BBQ pizza, it was a good portion, I finished the whole thing and did not feel stuffed. We didnt have to wait too long in line to get seated which was cool....I guess it is because we got there at a decent time. It was cool watching all the gamblers and party drunks walking in and out of the casino! haha, very entertaining. =)"}
{"text":"Limited selection but they will sell you whatever is coming out of the oven for stock instead of making you wait for your pizza.  Reasonably priced compared to other airport food.  I appreciated the military discount also.

I grabbed a margherita pizza and walked right onto my flight with it.  Once seated, I had a quick piece and it was still a little too hot to eat.  They sprinkled some fresh basil on top before handing it to me and I really enjoyed the freshness of this delicious herb.  Nice bite and chew to the crust and a slight saltiness in the sauce made it a pretty dang good pie in an unexpected place."}
{"text":"This is not the same quality as any other CPK I have been to. When I walked up to the hostess stand, two men were standing there talking and completely ignored me. A woman came up a couple minutes later and asked if she could help me. Well, why else would I be standing there? 

Even though it was breakfast, I ordered a pizza because the breakfast menu options weren't that great. I ordered what I usually get from CPK, the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza. When it came out, first thing I noticed was the size. It's a little smaller than it usually is. Sure, it wasn't a big deal and to be honest, it was probably a good thing since I couldn't take leftovers with me, but I thought it was odd. I also noticed that it looked like the toppings were added after it was cooked. It's hard to explain but it looked \"off.\"

My waitress wasn't super friendly and I had to ask her for refills. Thats a pet peeve of mine. I also had to ask for my check. I think the restaurants in airports need to be on top of things because people are on a tight schedule! I fly a lot and love that you can watch the planes from the restaurant but sadly I will not return.

Note: If you have a rewards membership with CPK, you can't use it here."}
{"text":"5 stars for the value, 3 stars for the food.  It was the least expensive meal I had on the strip.  My friend and I shared a pizza and salad and came to only $30!  I felt like I hit a jack pot when I saw the bill."}
{"text":"Yuck, on many levels. Had lunch about 2pm on a Sunday afternoon...place was not busy at all. Ordered cocktails and 10 minutes later they still had not shown up. After a quick comment to our in the weeds (with two tables) waiter,  drinks were delivered with long apology.  Finally when our out of the frozen pizza box pizza showed up, we had to ask for silverware. After what seemed like another 10 minutes, the GUEST at the next table got up and returned with OUR silverware and extra napkins for himself???   Waiter finally showed back up and had not remembered our request for silverware.   The signature bbq chicken pizza was aweful...dry, chewy chicken with no real bbq flavor...this place was bad on every level, we ate on the patio, and literally every table needed bussing for the full hour and a half it took us to wait and dine, instead of bussing tables they would shuffle folks off to the inside to eat on this beautiful weather afternoon....All was bad,  except for the Moscow Mule cocktail. Only reason I generously offered 2 stars.....but heck at almost $9 for one drink, one would hope it was good...."}
{"text":"Love this location. Located in the heart of Town Square it's a great choice after catching a movie with friends. I always order the Mac and Cheese bites as an app an BBQ chicken pizza as an entree. Parking at Town Square garage, uncovered lot, street and valet."}
{"text":"Good stopover before our flight. Pizza never disappointing and this time we tried the spinach dip as an appetizer.  It was pretty amazing. The food was a little slow getting to the table but the waitstaff was nice and courteous. Everything was tasty and in order. Nothing special nothing not."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim to get something to eat. It's been a while since I have been here and I was not disappointed. My wife and I both had salad and they where fresh and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Servers are condescending and too eager to get you out of there than they are taking care of customers. Bar has no chargers or outlets, FYI. Terrible service, bar area stinks of rotten beer swill and it is not clean. Asked to have it cleaned due to the overwhelming stench and the little manager with a giant chip on his shoulder treated me like a criminal, yet you can see the swill laying in the drain. Disgusting. $13.50 for two diet cokes and a lukewarm coffee. Would have spent over $50 plus tip if I decided to stay for lunch but I couldn't stomach the reeking swill.  HMS, this group of nitwits doesn't represent you well.  And they most certainly aren't doing any service to the CPK brand."}
{"text":"Yikes! I think the step one in any restaurant is to get you seated and take your order. I sat myself at the bar and waited 20 minutes while trying to flag down the bartender to take my order! I did the handwaving as well as the aggressive eye contact and neither method worked. When somebody else that down after me and the bartender took their order, I decided to take my $50 lunch stipend elsewhere.

I have low expectations for CPK, and they still managed to underwhelm."}
{"text":"I'd love for someone from CPK's corporate office to stop in here for a meal. I think they'd either revoke the franchise license or, if they own this location, fire all of the employees.

Alexa G. and I came here for lunch while waiting on our flights back to Atlanta (her suggestion, not mine, by the way). We saw a hostess stand, but no hostess.  There were free tables and we assumed they had open seating. After about 5 minutes a server saw us and told us we needed to get up and wait for someone at the front to seat us. No big deal. Before we were given a table she told us that we couldn't dine there if our departure time was within 45 minutes. Initially I felt like that was thoughtful to make sure we didn't miss our flight.  I later realized that was just permission for their staff not to be efficient.

Our server was friendly and kept making corny jokes.  We both ordered Coke and he brought them out and said it was Bacardi and Coke. Do you laugh at that? I think I smiled and then rolled my eyes.

The food was the same, basic CPK stuff you get anywhere.  I have no idea what took so long for them to prepare a barbecue pizza and a bowl of soup. It was at least 30 minutes before it all came out.

Towards the end of our meal it seemed like our server quit.  I tried standing up to get his attention, but that didn't work. Finally I told another employee we needed our check.  I saw our guy fumbling at one of their touch screen registers.  It probably wouldn't have been so confusing for him if there hadn't been a pile of dirty dishes blocking the screen."}
{"text":"We came here twice during our stay in Vegas. They were very nice and accommodating, able to change the food for my special dietary needs. They even remade my order without charging me for my meal. The manager was super nice and the staff was great. I loved the food, very tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza but I was bummed they refused to customize it.. They only do that for 10inch pizza and bigger. Not had that problem before anywhere.. In Vegas of all places would expect better."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was great.  We had a potato soup which was OK, but also had a sweet corn appetizer that was fantastic and we had a pizza with a cauliflower crust - the crust was great and much more healthy (too bad there is an additional $2.50 charge for the crust).  The pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY DO NOT GO HERE!! Food sucks, it didn't even look clean and fresh. Service is the worst you can ever imagine, I would give them a negative star and negative tips if I could! I totally don't understand why there are some people leave more than a star here? It is just impossible to have a positive feeling dinning at this pizza store. If you are looking for an irritating server who ruins your mode and some almost poison food, this is the place you wanna go!"}
{"text":"I've been to California Pizza at a different location, and was disappointed in this one. The waitress wasn't friendly and didn't take our orders correct and it's also located in the casino, next to the sports center and the smoke is VERY strong (reasons for star deductions). However, I love their mango lemonade and the chopped Italian salad. The margarita pizza and club pizza were good. It's more of a speciality pizza joint instead of a regular pepperoni pizza place. I would recommend the salad and lemonade, but at a different location."}
{"text":"Yeah, so I've become the douchebag with the iPhone. I've also become the even bigger douchebag with a ton of iPhone apps like Yelp. But since I am trying to be healthy, I also have the Eat This, Not That! App

The other day, I was talking around Town Square with my Dad and he was really in the mood for CPK. 

I decided that I could find something healthy using this app. 

I'm not going to write reviews about the ambiance, or all that jazz. This is a CPK...if you are coming to Yelp to learn about CPK's then you need some serious help (er...Yelp).

They have this \"Small Cravings\" menu which is a pathetic joke. Charging 5 bucks for 2 pieces of pita and a spoon of hummus? Are you fucking out of your mind? Yes, I am back to swearing in my reviews. This is lame. This isn't a small craving....its a giant fucking joke.

Anyway....I am calm....I ordered the White Pizza. I remembered that although I needed something healthy, I had a long road trip through the desert and I had to keep food in my stomach. The pizza came out, and it was delicious. Thin crust. One downside...it was covered in grease, so I went ahead and de-greased it with a napkin.

Once I took off 5 hospital surgeries worth of grease, I had my tasty pizza and was on my way.

If you want something healthy...don't plan on eating here. Salads are a joke. Very few dishes are under 1000 calories. Only eat here if you know you need the calories for a road trip through the desert. Or if you want to be fat and have given up on your life.

(Disclaimer....I am fat.)"}
{"text":"Can you believe it that this was my first time at any CPK!!I always passed the one where I lived but people always had their opinions that swayed me not to eat there. Now, in Vegas and getting ready to watch a show, I decided to give them a chance and explore myself. I ordered the Roasted Artichoke and Spinach Pizza. My friend ordered the Garlic Creme Fettuccine with Chicken. My pizza was fantastic, I loved it and was happy that we came here instead of some other place around the Mirage. My friend loved her pasta as well. 

Warning: Since this CPK is in the Mirage there can be a long line, so come early if you have a show you need to watch and want to catch dinner before it or if you want to get dinner before hitting the clubs or the casinos. The waitress was nice and served me another drink when needed. My experience was great and would not mind going to a CPK near my area, but it is a bit pricey so this is not your typical cheap pizza takeout."}
{"text":"The thing I like about CPK is you always know what you are getting.  I ate at this restaurant on the way out of town.  We had an outstanding waitress named Dulce.  She kept our drinks full and the service was quick and friendly.  The pizza was well cooked which I like.  If you are traveling through the airport and looking for a satisfying meal before a long flight this is an excellent place."}
{"text":"Get the butter cake.


I crave CPK's butter cake more often that I would like to admit. 


In terms of starters, I love their brussel sprout flatbread! When I order an entree I almost always get their Chinese Chicken Salad. This salad is the first salad I've ever had that made me say \"wow, that's a good salad!\". I rarely do salad for dinner but their Chinese Chicken Salad is so good that I end up ordering it again and again.

But for me, the real reason to go to California Pizza Kitchen is the butter cake. I never would have ordered it from the menu description unless the manager had not, himself, highly recommended that I try it. It is SO good. Out of this world delicious! 

Aside from the food, I have always had excellent service at this CPK. The wait staff is always attentive and friendly. I would recommend going here (and definitely getting the butter cake) if you're in Legacy shopping. You are also able to order online and pick it up if that's more your style!"}
{"text":"Eating on the Vegas strip used to be a problem --- there are the high end restaurants, the buffets, fast food, but not much else.  And eating healthy?  Forget about it.

Well, thanks to CPK's salads, eating healthy on the Vegas strip got a little easier."}
{"text":"I had never heard of California Pizza Kitchen (aside from the frozen pizzas) before I got to Vegas, and since this place was in our hotel, we decided to come down here one night for some dinner. I can't remember what time it was exactly, but we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table so it wasn't too bad. It was busy when we went, and it seemed like they were pretty much always busy, regardless of the time.

We actually had CPK twice. Once, we dined in and the other my boyfriend ordered and brought back to our room for a late night dinner when I didn't feel like getting out of my PJ's. Both times, we got the Garlic Cheese Focaccia as an appetizer and it was pretty dang good. The first time, we got the Tostada Pizza with chicken added and it was actually really good. Really crispy crust and the salsa they put on the side is legit.

The second time, we got the Meat Cravers which was just alright. I usually like to have some kind of vegetables on my pizza, and my boyfriend says no way. So I usually have to side with him, as I did in this case. It wasn't terrible, just not my cup of tea.

I think this is definitely a legit option if you're staying at the Mirage or someplace close by. The prices aren't terrible, but you have to remember that any restaurant in a hotel is going to be more pricey than those outside the hotels. This place isn't too bad considering the amount of food that you get. The service also stays on par with most other restaurants, and the food is pretty good. So not a bad option if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I have to agree with most of the reviews here - in the words of Flula from Pitch Perfect 2, this place was a \"heated mess.  You know, a mess where heat is applied to it so what once was a little messy is now even messier.\"

My family and I were on our way back to Honolulu from our weekend trip to Vegas.  We frequent Vegas a few times a year so we've always noticed this CPK in the Las Vegas McCarran Airport but didn't actually patronize it until that weekend.  We're actually more of a Chili's family which was right around the corner, about 5 or so gates down.  But upon our check-in with the Chili's hostess, were told it would be at least a 20-minute wait.  So CPK here we came.

LOCATION:  conveniently located at the top of the escalators in Terminal 3 across from Ruby's Diner and Pandora.

SERVICE:  extremely lacking.  Although we were seated almost immediately, it took a half an our for our waitress to bring us our drinks and I never received the sweetener I asked for to use in my iced tea.  I eventually gave up and got some from a different table.  Our waitress never noticed nor did she address the fact that she had forgotten.  Now, keep in mind, the restaurant was not very busy when we first got seated.  Business did pick up, but not soon enough to constitute such slow service.  It took over an hour to get our food - so long that we almost got it to-go because we were about to have to start boarding.  Our waitress kept apologizing and giving the excuse that they were busy.  And?  Don't most restaurants yearn for that?  And in a high-traffic airport.

FOOD:  a little dfiferent from your stand-alone CPKs.  The menu has far less items and, in my case, different food items altogether.  At typical CPKs, I order the creamy alfredo, add chicken and broccolini.  Nowhere on the menu.  I did find, however, garlic cream chicken penne which was actually very tasty.  The rest of my table enjoyed their food as well, you know, once we finally got it.  In my opinion, the taste of the food is what gave this review an extra star.

PRICE:eh, what you'd expect from a CPK in an airport.

Bottom line, if you're not in a hurry and want something you're used to, by all means, stop here.

{"text":"It was deliciouse , but a bit expensive. It is located after the casino. So be prepared for noisy atmosphere however it is not that bad."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and quick so this is not about the wait staff. They did a really good job. But the food is not good! I ordered the chicken club sandwich with a side salad... the salad was brown and looked like it was just dumped out of a bag and drizzled with cheap bottled ranch dressing .... the chicken on the sandwich seemed processed and flavorless. The bread was dry and bland , the tomatoes were grainy and soggy and the bacon was hard. 

There is no love in this food. I don't blame the cooks - I blame the corporation trying to save money by using cheap ingredients. C'mon guys- we deserve better ! This meal felt like you're barely trying."}
{"text":"Wow.. He's right this place is a joke! Bad food and service... The nice manager tried to make it right but she's not the one cooking!

{"text":"Place looked good from a distance, but waiter Izzy  had not been trained to address  women, and  called us \"girls\" even though my daughter  is a lawyer and I am a professor  and we look professional. Even if we had been  anybody off the street, it was unacceptable behavior . When  I reported this lack of professionalism to the m.o.d., Laura, she was dense and unable to understand that  \"girls\" is a form of address that went out with the fifties and is not to be used by men to address women, especially in a service  context. Laura  is clueless  about  rules of professional  customer service and she and the waiter should get some customer service training  since they  lack the sense of iwhat constitutes professional behavior and what  does not."}

When it finally came, it looked like somebody threw up on top of iceberg lettuce. Cold, mushy, bland chicken on top of a drenched bed of poor quality iceberg lettuce that looks like it came out of a bag at Walmart. 

This was a $16 salad, it isn't even worth $5. 

Very disappointing"}

We ate here two out of three nights while staying at the Mirage for a trade show. The restaurants proximity next to the sports bar and multi screen TV wall had nothing to do with the choice. Honest!
There was no wait for our table and the rapid refreshment delivery by our waiter started us out on the right track. 
 The menu has a fantastic selection of pasta and the best fresh pizza that will satisfy any hunger created from working and playing. Our waiter contributed his opinions as we filled out parlay sheet for Superbowl XLVIII. With a full belly and multiple drinks, all was right with the world!"}

Yesterday, my family and i went there around noon.  It was busy, like normal.  The food was average at best.  Except for the hummus, which was quite good.  Our server, Tim was on his game.   It was obvious he has worked in the industry for a while.  He was friendly, fast and efficient.  He didn't miss a beat, even when a drink was spilled----that's what happens when kids are involved.   The service was impeccable.  We eat at a lot of \"high end\" restaurants and the service  is always good but this  was hands down the best we have seen in years."}

Management seemed not to care."}
{"text":"Pretty average, yet tasty food. Quick service. I had the avocado club egg rolls and the Napa Power Bowl. Both did not disappoint. Huge portions and fresh food. Only complaint is it's a bit pricey. Gorgeous patio seating available."}
{"text":"Great place, great food and wonderful staff!
The Dynamite shrimp appetizer is fabulous!  Our sever was very nice and knew about every dish! The ladies that seat us were both very nice and my granddaughter fell in love with one of them. I hate i didnt get any names. But they were all so nice and our food was delicious!  And cook just right!"}
{"text":"We ate at CPK last night. The ambiance is nice for a family get together.  Our server, Eric, was fairly pleasant and greeted all of us warmly.  We ordered pizzas and salads. All were very good, although the pizzas are smaller than the last few times I've been there, but toppings were abundant. The food took more time than expected to get to us, but it was worth the wait.  The only complaints I have are 1) the service was slower than  prior visits and 2) our server was clearing the table and rather than going to the left of me to clear some dishes, he actually reached over from my right side to clear them ... right in front of my face as I was taking a bite of pizza!  It was awkward!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place was garbage. First off, extremely poor service. My friend tried to order a drink and they grilled his ID for about 15 minutes. Not a good start to our meal.

About twenty minutes later we get our drinks and some cold, stale bread with packets of butter. Delicious, right?

Our server was virtually unseen and it took forever to get our food. Did I mention that the food wasn't very good? My friend and I shared the pizza salad. The bread was stale and the salad was mediocre at best. Our other friend had the chipotle chicken pizza which he seemed to enjoy.

Overall though, terrible service and pretty terrible food. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is tasty. They have some of the best spinach artichoke dip. Kids were running around everywhere, jumping up on the booths and tables, and throwing napkins everywhere. Aside from a crowded and unruly customer base, this place has great za"}
{"text":"Had one of the worst dining experiences I have had in years at this restaurant. Took over 20 minutes for the waiter to come to my table, and 30 minutes more for them to bring me a soup, which had inedible bits of fiber in it. I brought this to the attention of the manager who was all excuses, and took no responsibility. Stay away!"}
{"text":"When we are in Vegas which is about 3 x per year, I always stop by the Fashion Show Mall for a short stint with reality.   If hungry, the California Pizza Kitchen is a perfect place to stop.  Great menu, great variety and very consistent.   This last visit the manager stopped by my table to see how our lunch was.  We chatted for awhile and I then let her know that I know it wasn't her call, but that what the restaurant charged for adding on avocado to a salad was \"highway robbery\".  Said I thought they should rethink their pricing.  She understood and left the table.  When she came back she brought me a complimentary side of avocado and thanked me for sharing my thoughts.   Then before I left, she came by with a HAND WRITTEN thank you for being a loyal CPK customer and included a gift card to buy myself a salad when I returned home.   So kind, so customer service oriented and so appreciated!   Well done."}
{"text":"On my Weekend Trip to Las Vegas....May 14-16...I stopped by CPK on saturday afternoon....and BOY O Boy was it a trek to find this spot in the Fashion Show Mall...Phewww!!!!

Good thing the food was so good though. YUMMM!!!
The bread was hot and good...the waitress was perfecto

We had BBQ Pizza, Appetizers, Chicken Alfredo & Drinks


Rather expensive for 3 people at lunch time though"}
{"text":"GOOD AIRPORT FOOD. Unlike others that heat precooked meals - 
This place actually cooks their food at the airport. 
* Meditteranean omellete breakfast -  excellent.
* Vegetarian spinach mushroom pizza - excellent
* Caesar salad - excellent
LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. One young waitress with a huge  rear serving breakfast just walked off while I was still enquiring about an item on menu.."}
{"text":"Love Pizza Kitchen  in California, here in Las Vegas they never seem to get it right, double check your bag as I guarantee something will be missing or incorrect"}
{"text":"Service and food were good...great place to get eat in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"this review is for the california pizza kitchen inside the fashion show mall.  

first of all.. out of all the california pizza kitchens i've been to, this one has the worst service.  i work inside of the mall so i consider myself a regular here and bad service is something that i find on most of my visits.  when you first walk in, you'll find the chatty hostesses who will talk to their friends in front of you while you stare at them and wait for them to seat you.  most of the waiters/waitresses will take their sweet ass time to get to you and help you with what you need, especially if what you needed was a refill of your drink.  on one occasion, they charged me the wrong amount to my credit card and i had to drive back to CPK just to get it fixed.  on a second occasion, i came with friends and we paid for the bill in twenty dollar bills.. well you know how you're supposed to get change back right? the waiter took our money and DISAPPEARED.  we sat there waiting for 30 minutes for him to return and no one came around.  since it was late and the rest of the mall was closing, we just gave up and left.  even though i got compensated for it by the manager (she's a real sweetheart) when i came around a second time, i gotta warn you guys to be careful when you're paying for your meal.. whether you pay with cash or card. 

anyways, as for everything else, the restaurant is clean, the seats aren't cramped, and the portions are a little below average compared to other CPKs (i guess i expect that when i'm dining at the fashion show mall).

the food is standard and consistent.  one thing i really recommend is the garlic cream fettuccine.. like seriously its the only thing i order every time i come.  if you've never had it before, its a nice big plate of noodles with a thick white sauce that fills you up good for 10 dollars.  you can add chicken and mushrooms to it for an extra cost, but i don't.  one plate of noodles can be shared between two people for a meal that won't make you feel bloated despite the heavyness of the sauce.  the spaghetti bolognese is good too if you want something tomato-y.  theres a garlic tomato-y spaghetti that they sell that i don't recommend anyone to eat.. unless they enjoy a mouth full of garlic flavor that super minty gum can't remove. the pesto is not my favorite.  the salads here are on the ehh side. for appetizers, the fried macaroni and cheese (it has a fancier name.. but i forgot it) is delicious! but it's on the small side.  it comes with four pieces (my picture only shows two because i have a bad habit of eating my food and then remembering to take a picture) on a plate with cheesy sauce.  as for the pizzas.. i can't say anything about them.  i don't like pizza ): 

overall, the food here is just as good as any other california pizza kitchen but i'd rather go to town square or the mirage because the service would be better there.

p.s. when they ask you if you want to sit inside or outside, choose INSIDE! from my experience, the service is faster. oh and ask for free bread.  yum!

p.p.s i've recently discovered that you get more food with take out!"}
{"text":"So I love the CPK in Palm Springs, CA which was why I decided to have lunch at the CPK at the Las Vegas airport.  The service was TERRIBLE.  The wait staff went to tables around me several times until I finally flagged down the hostess to ask if she could send a server over.  Also had to ask for my check and no one came by after dropping off my meal to refill water or ice tea or ask how the food was until I was leaving.  Basically I get is was a service 101 fail."}
{"text":"Great option if your staying at the Mirage or just passing through. Reasonably priced pizza and pasta dishes served by a friendly staff and management. I got the BBQ chicken pizza as it was to commended to me as a house favorite and I was definitely happy with this choice. Hit the spot. Will be eating here again."}
{"text":"If you like dirty tables and used dishes at your table when you arrive, then this is the place for you !!! Especially great if you are not in a hurry and can wait 10-15 minutes to meet your server. Dirty rags are used for a quick wipe down upon request but I'll caution you, the servers are not happy about patrons asking about clean tables. The fragrant odors coming from the floor, the tables and the airport make it an elegant location for dining. Wow!!! This place is horribly wrong and should be evaluated by the FDA. Enjoy your pizza!!! What a dump"}
{"text":"Nice staff fast and polite. Clean and orderly for an airport location. I ordered the Tortilla Soup at $5+ not bad. It was a big plateful of soup!"}
{"text":"This was probably the BEST California Pizza Kitchen that I have ever been to.

Our server was down to earth!  He was a local boy from Hawaii and KNEW that we were from Hawaii... and we received his full attention.

He helped us select our entrees and suggested the mango iced tea which was amazing!
We ordered a Jamaican Jerk Chicken, California Club, and The Works.
(Trying to order the same exact combination at another location in Disneyland... they were an epic failure!)

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be sure to save a trip to Fashion Show Mall's California Pizza Kitchen. :)"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great atmosphere, and fantastic food! Such a nice place to relax and have a good drink and great food! The small plates are a must!"}
{"text":"Not sure if you can give 0 stars so I will give one for the food which was good, but the rest of my experience was horrible.  Literally the worst service I have ever had.  Our server came to our table once to take the order then we never saw him.  The manager Frank brought the bill and told me he had to run my card 5 times because it kept declining but, he was able to finally get it to charge.  He said this in front of my entire party which I felt was rude and unnecessary and obviously an issue with his machine not the card.  Anyways horrible service rude managers epic fail.  Thanks CPK we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Okay, I gave this five stars not because it's a five star restaurant but the food was fresh, and hot.  The service was unbeatable.  Wine and drink menu good.  It was just me and I had the chicken taco pizza.. Or something like that.  Way to much,  needed to share with one or more people.  I would come here  again."}
{"text":"Tried a premade salad, NASTY! Maybe the pizza would have been a better choice. Many people seemed satisfied."}
{"text":"Love the servers at this CPK.  They see do friendly and remember you and what you ordered.  Amazing! Happened to us twice with two different servers.  Love their salads and thin crust pizza!"}
{"text":"Good pizza but who changes their beer system during the holidays?  $8 for a bottle of domestic is a ripoff.

So much for pizza and a beer..."}
{"text":"Probably the worst CPK i've ever been to. Very limited menu, everything we got was cold and previously frozen. Very small portions. Very slow service.

Spinach artichoke dip- cold, we had to ask them to reheat it
bread- not free, $2 for 2 slices
bbq chicken pizza- not that warm, too saucy, clearly frozen and heated up
quinoa salad- barely any quinoa, all lettuce, WAY too much dressing

Overall- not planning on eating here again...."}
{"text":"First and last visit to this franchise. The cashier wasn't even familiar with the items on their menu and kept asking me to repeat my order for their pea and barley glop. (I've had better pea soup from a can.) She was already irritated and her confusion added to her attitude. We had to clean off one of the several empty tables even though the staff was standing around chatting with each other. The bar-b-que chicken pizza was burned, the artichoke and spinach dip with stale chips was so gross. What a rip-off for such terrible food, dirty restaurant with unfriendly staff."}
{"text":"I'm celiac, so eating anywhere is a challenge, especially a place known for gluten! I took a chance for breakfast and the waiter was super friendly and the manager came out to discuss my options to make sure I didn't get sick! I also got and extra serving of fruit on the house! Can only speak for my one meal, but the Denver omelet was yummy too ;)"}
{"text":"If you have to eat breakfast in this airport, this is more in the side of more reasonably priced, and I mean that relative to the airport. Three eggs, toast, bacon OR sausage and potatoes OR fruit will run you $9.79. It's not as ridiculously expensive as the airport could be. Same deal can be for two eggs ($9.29) or 1 egg ($8.79). I got three, fruit and I asked for potatoes instead of meat, which they accommodated. 

The coffee, which I really needed after 5 days in Vegas, was terrible. It tasted like cigarette ashes. My mother in law got a HUGE bowl of fruit fruit salad as a side. They forgot to bring my fruit so a man, drinking a Red Bull, brought out the smallest bowl of fruit in his hand, no tray. He gripped it with his fingers along the lip, not from the bottom. It was so weird and gross. My mother in law said the fruit was fresh. It looked good - blueberries, cantaloupe, honeydew, a sliced strawberry. 

Back to the breakfast special which comes with three  strips of bacon and a large serving of potato wedges. No one needs to eat that much for breakfast. But the portions are large, except for my tiny bowl of touched fruit."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place two stars is because the manager was very nice and my friend's hummus was good. I ordered their chicken BBQ pizza and it took 45 minutes to get it to the table. Once I received the pizza it was not correct. I had an hour before my flight started boarding and thought that I'd have at least 30 minutes to get to the gate and look around. That didn't happen. By the time I got the second pizza, I had to rush to the gate and ate it on the plane. Our waitress didn't seem to care that we had a flight and that other tables (not in her area) had received their food before us, even though we had been there 30 minutes before them. Not good service. Don't recommend for those who have flights to catch...which is pretty much everyone in an airport."}
{"text":"Oh CPK! The flavors and the staple chopped salad hold up in this far from C location, but I have to deduct one star for the run down environs at this location. Most would probably not notice but in my experience, CPK usually takes it a step higher. Food was still great though!"}
{"text":"Had a flight delay at LAX so popped into CPK, as I had the time, and had a nosh. The Shishito peppers are my new potato chips. Not a hot pepper, a finger food and tasty as all get out. Sautéed in olive oil with sea salt and red chili flakes they are beyond good. This was on a Tuesday, it is now Saturday and I've had my 3rd lunch at CPK Las Vegas . Our server, Terrah, is reason enough to keep going back, such a lovely girl and remembered my girl and I . The salads are massive so I got a half order and it was plenty, plus, you can do add ons.There was another gentleman that we sat with but I do not recall his name (my bad ) he was wonderful. I feel I must mention Caesar who was ever so nice. A manager (female) stopped by to chat with us and we really did appreciate that. I used to go to CPK years ago in Atlanta and I must say that they have come a long way as the menu is just outstanding, we love it. I was not aware of the butter cake so gotta go back for that. Great staff and food, really."}
{"text":"Gave us Bacon in the veggie pizza and then charged us for a replacement one as well. We got the veggie pizza with a piece of bacon and pointed it out to the waitress. She got the store manager who convinced my mother-in-law (who was the only pure vegetarian person in our group ) that she would get her a kids size pizza though we said no. Next thing you know we were charged for both the pizza. The taste wasn't that great either!"}
{"text":"What happened? My husband went to go and pick up an order that we phoned in.. of Thai Linguini and Wedge Salad (for me), Chicken lettuce wraps, and a salad for himself, but ended up waiting an additional 30 minutes after arriving, because they 'just' started making it when he stepped through the door? Boo!"}
{"text":"I was at the California Pizza kitchen at the Mirage on April 12th, 2009. It was Easter Sunday and we had all woken up from a long night of gambling and partying. We decided it would be the perfect spot after hittin the swimming pool at the Mirage. 

Two of my buddies ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and I had ordered a Pepporoni Pizza and my other buddy ordered a Pepporoni Supremo. When our orders had come out, the portions didn't look too big for the amount they cost. But once we all took a bite of out of our pizzas, we thought it was worth every penny. The BBQ chicken pizza didn't sound like a good idea to me, but once I took a slice, it bursted with flavor. My pepporoni pizza was just perfect and the pepporoni supremo was even better. It had a few additional seasonings. The crusts were thin and they weren't overly greasy. The service was perfect and we loved every moment of our visit! 

Great pizza, great service! Check it out!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I have been contemplating on whether or not to post this review. I've thought long and hard about it but I think it's important that this feedback be shared. 

A couple of weeks ago a friend and I met here for dinner. I don't want to go into details but here's what you should know. There is a certain waiter here who needs some basic customer service training.

 It's fun to occasionally joke with your waiter but there is a flow when you are at a restaurant and your server should be busy enough that they don't have a lot of time to socialize at your table. This was not the case. Though we tried to politely indicate that we weren't there to socialize with him, he wouldn't \"take the hint.\" Things got weird, uncomfortable, and awkward. He slammed the dessert menu on our table!  He got angry and said some strange things. I'm no Psychology major but I took enough in college to know that he's bordering on sociopath. 

When we complained to the manager, we never got an apology. We got some excuses, \"He's the best waiter we have, etc.\" Umm...Really?! 

To be fair, he did comp our meal which was nice. 

Bottom line: the food was fine. But I will never patronize this location again."}
{"text":"love pizza, but not all pizza does justice..  
cpk, fulfills my pizza expectations as far as options.  
my absolute favorite from this joint: carne asada on pesto pizza is my number one forever.. [especially from cpk]  others: bbq chicken and the tri colore.  

there's usually a wait, but any restaurant at town square is the same.  a place located in a busy shopping mall will do that.
on a sidenote: it's not rare that we've had to go somewhere else because of a really long wait.

service has always been good at the townsquare location.. they're usually very patient and on point with recommendations and explanations of the menu which is good.   never seem frustrated with a million questions which is doubly good. 

'to go' is also a great thing.  ordering to go from CPK and enjoying your food at one of the tables provided throughout town square makes the dining and people watching experience pretty dope. 

other perks: tortilla soup.  one of the better tasting tortilla soups I've had.. oh! and their bread!"}
{"text":"First time at CPK for breakfast. I cannot recall seeing one at an airport. Located in terminal B.

I asked for recommendation. Egg & Cheese was said to be top seller. Service by manager friendly, no issues with ordering process on a slow morning. Prices high, but an airport, so you know the drill bend over.

Food out within 5 min and was in a huge to go bag. They never asked if for here, or to go. I was eating in.

Dining room spotless and quite large. Nice bar in the middle. A few CPK pieces on the wall for atmosphere.

Sandwich above expectation. Hot, fresh eggs, gooey cheese and crisp bread tasted to perfection. Liked and if returning would get it again.

A nice grab and go area us up front constantly manned by an employee. Solid collection of drinks and food items.

Visit except for not asking if dine/carry out was excellent. I will return if back in the area and now look for them in airports. Overall 3.5, rounding down for missed opportunity at counter that involved manager."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of pizza lately so I wasn't too excited to eat here, but after eating here I am truly sad I spent my money here. First off, when I told the front person my name, she had the hardest time spelling it even after I told her how to spell my name letter by letter. I had to use another name. Second off, when I ordered my usual pizza (bbq chicken), they didn't have honey wheat bread. What CPK doesn't have honey wheat bread??? Third off, when the pizza arrived it looked like a personal pan pizza from Pizza Hut yet it was the same price as the normal sized pizza at other CPKs. So..I didn't get the crust I wanted, the pizza was smaller, and I paid the same price?

Also note that their menu is limited here. The only plus is that they have seating here whereas the other places in the food court do not."}
{"text":"I've had better service in another city..."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to California Pizza and may I say the food was delicious. The crust was super thin, the meat tasted very fresh not over cooked. Management was spectacular they circled around the restaurant and checked on customers to make sure there food was ok. The waitress was awesome the whole atmosphere was awesome we will definitely go again. Now I know why they are always busy. The district manager came to out table he was very friendly"}
{"text":"Decent food and decent service! Very pleased with their drinks it was honestly the best Bloody Mary I've had in a long long time and who would have thought at California pizza kitchen haha! Keep it up I may have to try more of your restaurants were I'm from."}
{"text":"Just like any CPK, this one has good food. Unlike most, this one has an AMAZING value for the food you get. You can actually have a complete dinner in Vegas for under $20. 

You do lose out a little, the quality of food is slighly lower than it's mainstream counterparts. (ie the lettuce just isn't as fresh.) Overall though, I'd recommend this place to anyone staying at or near the Mirage."}
{"text":"I have never tried California Pizza Kitchen before, and after this experience, I will not try again. I ordered a turkey club with garden salad, and it's pretty terrible. I can make better turkey club sandwich than this place.  They don't have enough servers as my server was running all over the place ordering food, picking up dirty dishes."}
{"text":"When I go on vacation, I always have one rule and that is to not eat where I can eat back home...there are way different and better places on vacation, you just need to seek them out.  And being in Las Vegas...you don't have to look far.

So, this time I made an exception because the sign for CPK walking through the casino advertised HAPPY HOUR 3-5pm and that being 50% off beer & pizza.  Score!

We arrived after 3:00 and got seated immediately.  We ordered a few pints of beer and got 3 pizzas total.  The three of us planned to split two pizzas but got a third because it was still \"happy hour\".  We got a chicken and garlic pizza and a california chicken type pizza with avocado.  They were both delicious!  I will admit I do not eat at CPK here in Illinois often, and I doubt they have this deal so I can't say the last time I ate at one till last week while staying at the Mirage.

Everything was good here...service, quality, and price!  Consider this place for a late lunch...it's quite a deal!"}
{"text":"This location does not have the full menu like the actual restaurants and the food was not really fresh. Avoid if possible and eat something else at the airport. Service was kind of slow as well."}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with the tostada pizza and all the other unique pizzas. I always enjoy trying something new here. The price/portion is just right for me. The salads are also very large portions and tasty."}
{"text":"This place will never receive my business again. I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes just for the waiter to even say hello. I understand that this place is busy, but other restaurants on the strip especially in a hotel of the Mirage's quality can do way better than this. Even throughout our meal, the waiter did not even come once to check on us or refill our drinks. This is unacceptable and reflects very poorly on the Mirage."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for dinner before checking out of the Mirage. The food was very good and the pizza was delicious! The ranch is to die for. Our waiter was slow but other than that this is a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Inside the fabulous Fashion Show Mall on the corner of Spring Mountain and Las Vegas Boulevard, the CPK here keeps you safe from the outdoor wind chills and cools you down from the blazing hot summer days. One of my favorite parts about this particular one is that you get to people watch while you eat. When I was working inside the Fashion Show mall, I would order lunch ahead of time by calling it in and picking it up (fast, great service!) and some days, I would order it ahead of time and lounge on a table and people while enjoying lunch.

It's kind of redundant to place in a review for a pizza chain like CPK, but the reason why I chose to review this place was not only to share my own experiences, but to let out-of-towners know WHY they should eat at this particular one. It's like decyphering the business owner's reasons why (not counting the placement for revenue inside one of the busier malls in Las Vegas, haha!). So here's what I love to order from here:

CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD: is my favorite salad of all time and I like to order it when I got to different places. Hard to say that CPK is the best one (I make the best one :P) but it's my favorite from the menu. Sometimes the lettuce could be a bit fresher, but when it is fresh? YUM!

TUSCAN HUMMUS: deh-lish-isssss! I can eat an entire bucket of this hummus! It's soo addicting! I usually order this and a salad and I'm good to go for a few hours. This is the reason why I ventured out to try different hummuses outside of CPK!

ITALIAN PIZZA (discontinued pizza, wahh!): I remember speaking to one of the servers and they broke the heartbreaking news to me! :'( My girlfriend's sister is the one who introduced me to this one and it became my favorite! The ingredients missing from the replacement pizza (Mushroom, Pepperoni, Sausage pizza) is the peppers that lit up the pizza. If I remember correctly, they changed the sausages too! :( Major disappointment! I'm a semi-health nut so I order on the honey wheat with whole grain crust!

3 stars because it isn't super different from the others, deducted for the change of menu and average service from the staff but cool points for having ordered from the phone and never having to wait ridiculous amounts of time. Would I come back? Yeah, I'm actually thinking about it right now! NEW ITEMS ON THE MENU TOO!

Korean BBQ tacos?! .......to be continued!"}
{"text":"I highly recommended to don't go there due to small portion and higher prices at least for my order. Taste was fare service good."}
{"text":"Pretty good CPK.  Food was typical CPK quality, although they're probably using a standard oven, rather than the wood-fired style.  Crust wasn't as crispy, and didn't have that slight char flavor.
   The best part about the restaurant is that it's in the D terminal. The C terminal was crazy busy on a Thursday afternoon.  No where to sit, and very unsettling.  Took 2 easy trams from terminal C to D.  It's a nice, big spacious restaurant that was very relaxing & a really cool view of the runway/terminal.  The relaxing quieter atmosphere is what brought this place from a 3.5 rating to a 4"}
{"text":"The service is horrible, I don't know how they can have one person running the counter top, the take out line and serve drinks for the customers inside the lobby. That's not fair on him and making people wait over 45 mins to  a hour for food. This was a waste of time for this food/service. I don't recommend coming here at all. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"After a week of working in Las Vegas I stopped here for breakfast on the morning of my flight home.  The service was fantastic.  After no wait at all Kimberly offered me much needed coffee before I even sat down.  She took my order after a perfect amount of time and had more coffee and a helpful smile and request about whether I needed anything else just as I thought about it.  Breakfast was delicious and just the right size!   Thanks!"}
{"text":"As a California native, I try my best to avoid anything California related (specifically when it comes to food) when I'm on vacation. However, since my group wanted to dine here, after a couple hours of shopping, I was out numbered.

The service here is on point!! I forgot what our waiter's name was now, but he was friendly, helpful, and extremely attentive to our needs. I saw him behind the bar area (or what ever that was) talking to another customer, but somehow he knew we needed refills. He brought our refills right over to us before our drinks were completely empty. I'm truly impressed with the service we received here.

I honestly wasn't impressed with the food. I live in California and I always avoided eating at this place because I had a feeling that the pizza wouldn't be that great. I was right. My pizza was on the bland side, even after adding parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. My boyfriend's pizza tasted a lot better than mine. My sister's dish, I think she ordered a sandwich or something, but her's was delicious. I'm just a bit disappointed that a pizza restaurant would have a hit or miss menu when it comes to their pizza (which they are allegedly known for).

I would give this place 3 out of 5 stars, but since the service was so great I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars. Although my pizza was a disappointment, there are other items on their menu that tasted pretty good. I wouldn't mind trying this place out again."}
{"text":"Some ok beers at high airport prices, which one knows and accepts. The 'Original BBQ Chicken Chopped' salad was the tiredest pile of pseudo nutrition I've seen for a while though. A third covered in tortilla strips fake nutrition, and looks like it's been in a cooler for a substantial while. Ah well. I shoulda known better."}
{"text":"Good food and my experience there ended up being great because of the manager Jamie. She stopped by the table, and had such a great demeanor,& she was very courteous and professional! I see why she is manager. There needs to be more mangers like her! I am actually surprised that she is not a district manager or someone higher in ladder."}
{"text":"My group order a turkey BLT sandwich, a BBQ chicken salad, and a cob salad. All three meals were good but a little pricy. The drink were good."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed many meals at California Pizza Kitchen at Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas.  I recently took an 8 year old young girl to lunch.  Our total bill was only $20.73. I gave our waitress $40 as I wanted change for a tip.
When she returned the change, I received only $19, no coins.  Although it was only
$.27 I thought it has fallen out of the folder she placed on the table.  I couldn't get her attention but did reach another server.  When I told her about the coin, her response was, \"Oh, we don't give change; we always round up.\"  WHAT???? 
I said I had never heard of that before and she offered to get our waitress.  When she came over, she reiterated the same message and proceeded to tell me, \"I have worked in 7 different restaurants in Las Vegas.  They are do that.\"  I told her also that I had never heard of that.  Her next comment was, \"Most Las Vegas restaurants do it and since you aren't from here, you didn't know.\"
I have lived in this town for 33 years - about 10 more than she'd been born.
I am appalled at this practice.  Do you know how much extra money that rip off from patrons?  No wonder that young lady has been at 7 restaurants - she has probably ripped off a lot of people and got caught.  
As a result, I will NEVER eat here again!  Just a matter of principle!"}
{"text":"So the food is as consistent as it gets. Just like going to CPK anywhere else. Unfortunately I have read other reviews and I see this place is getting low marks because of the slow boring consistent service. Well, welcome to the world of Airport dining ;). Well fortunately for us, we came in at a very quiet evening and had a awesome meal and a fantastic service. We tried a pasta dish, pizza, and a salad. I would rank the pasta at the top of my list."}
{"text":"We ordered the California Veggie and the pasta. The waitress was very brusque and rude. They wouldnt accomodate anything. We asked that they add the mushrooms and olives on only one side. They said that was not possible. WHAT??? Are the pizzas pre-made? Thats the only reason that we could assume that they wouldnt do that. How hard could that be? Add everything on one half and dont add everything on the other half. Takeaway pizza joints like Pizza Hut and Dominoes do this, but CPK cant? 
We got the pizza as is and then removed the mushrooms and olives by hand as one of our group was allergic. 
Th e pizzas themselves were Ok. Nothing special, and for the $20 they charge for one, we would have been a lot better off going to one of the regular chains and having a better pizza experience."}
{"text":"Good food. The location is convinient for folks staying at nearby hotels.  The waiters are great but the waitresses have a horrible attitude.  As if they're too good for their jobs.

Alright.  The truth is it's not all the waitresses. It's this one waitress name to Kelly. If you get her table, just ask to be moved."}
{"text":"CPK is usually safe bet.  Not this one.  I don't know if the staff is just having a bad day or what, but I've witnessed 3 altercations/arguments between customers and servers or bartenders.  People are pissed.

I sat for 15 minutes in the bar without being spoken to by a soul.  When I finally went to the bar to order a drink, a cocktail waitress showed up.  When I waited another half hour (I'm waiting on a flight and can at least futz with the laptop) with nobody around, the bartender was rude.  I am holding a freaking glass.  Ya think I have a tab open maybe?

I'll avoid this place forever."}
{"text":"CPK is hands down one of my favorite, go to restaurants for delicious, fresh and inventive salads. I have tried every single salad on the menu and can say with absolute certainty, each one is delightful and bursting with flavor. I am not usually one to frequent chain restaurants however I seem to make a weekly trip to CPK either for dine-in or carryout. The Moroccan Chicken Salad is my stand-by favorite and I usually get the Asparagus Soup as an appetizer which surprisingly has no cream but is still rich and velvety. The pizzas are very tasty as well, the BLT and pear and gorgonzola are among my favorites. The only slight downfall is that every time I dine in, it always seem as though there is at least one  screaming kid in the place!"}
{"text":"Well I see a number of recent diners have had issues with the service.  Not here.  I was with a group of about 10 people on a Saturday early eve, and all orders were taken and delivered efficiently, properly, and all at about the same time, which is excellent.  Very happy with the service.

The food, however, seemed lacking in flavor.  I had a wild mushroom pizza.  It could have used more zip.  And no pizza condiments were on the table to add more pep.  The roasted veggie salad looked good, but reality was some veggies mixed in with a lot of lettuce.  Having dressing on the side removed some of the flavor maybe, but the veggies could have been more interesting.

Frankly, the pizza tasted like a frozen pizza.  \"Made fresh\" should have a lot more flavor.  Sadly, it didn't.  Perhaps trying other dishes would be better here.  Maybe they are being too diverse and need to focus on the fundamentals....they have tacos, for Pete's sake!"}
{"text":"I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and a strawberry mojito. The mojito was good and the service was good. I normally love CPK, so I was very excited to see one while I was stuck at the airport. Unfortunately the pizza was not like the kind in the regular CPK restaurants.  Since its in an airport, you don't see anybody making pizza out front. Their pizza had no crust and was not crispy at all..very different from what you normally get in the actually retail chains. I have a feeling that it was the Frozen CPK BBQ chicken pizza that they just warmed up and overcharged us for. I would consider trying their pastas, which might be a little more consistent."}
{"text":"This is not a real CPK. They have a limited menu, which includes breakfast, and you CANNOT earn pizza dough here! Boo. My BBQ chicken salad also tasted a little off....

Other than that, the service was speedy and the waitress was friendly enough. It's located in the D terminal, but there are plenty of other establishments to grab a bite and kill time. 

They do offer the main things: spinach artichoke dip, pizza, BBQ chicken chopped salad. And, you can get all these favorites for breakfast!! There's nothing like gorging yourself on all the amazing food and drink Vegas has to offer and then eating a salad for breakfast at the airport. The only thing you can't get until normal lunch time is pasta. The breakfasts that I've never seen at any other cpk look good too. Prices are similar to what i pay at my local cpks (are they all the same?)."}
{"text":"Was grabbing a pizza to take to Rhumbar. Food was amazing and the Manager was pretty cool"}
{"text":"Saves the day! After the worst meal at Carmine's, CPK pulled through in its basic predictability! The service was 5 stars and we went right before closing so there was no reason to tend to us like they did--even offered a free dessert for my sister's birthday. I'd give it 4 stars just for their kindness and derive!"}
{"text":"We've been to California Kitchens all over but this was our 1st time at this particularly location.  We ordered 2 personal pizzas, a lunch special, and a full salad. It was my first time ordering the salad (I cannot remember the name but it had grapes, apples, celery, and nuts in it) and I couldn't eat it fast enough!! It was GREAT!! :). We all ate everything and there were absolutely no complaints! The waiter was very prompt and attentive and another staff member even came and checked on us as well prior to our departure.  Overall we had a great experience here with some great food. My daughter cannot get enough of the club pizza!"}
{"text":"Place was clean Pizza took about 10 minutes had to catch a flight Pizza was absolutely delicious thank you so much for the good pizza for the flight home"}
{"text":"Great Family restaurant. Good selections of pizza and salads. The only downside is that they don't have burgers or french fries so if your kids want that - they will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Warmth


Even if the flatbread wasnt Delicious
Witch it was, which it is
Kevin our server was so kind and attentive

But if you only care about food
The spinach Artichoke pizza
Amazing!!!
I love it
When vegetables taste like meat"}
{"text":"Terrible experience for take out.. why call ahead if they don't even start your order until you show up? Luckily my family was satisfied with the food because I waited an extra half hour for it."}
{"text":"Couldn't get any service after waiting for 20 minutes, so we decided to leave. If you want to wait a really long time I would recommend going here, otherwise don't bother!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love it here. The staff is good but the manager June is such a gem! Food was outstanding."}
{"text":"The guy working the pizza oven needs to stop singing loudly and being generally obnoxious. Maybe I'll come back if he's not working here. People seemed more interested in socializing than working."}
{"text":"I don't think I'll ever be coming back here again. Worst blue cheese dressing ever, lettuce was ready to turn and the pizza wasn't anything notable. I gave it a 2 because the server was good."}
{"text":"This place has REALLY good pizza & nice, strong drinks!

The only negatives is the price, most likely because it's inside a casino.. But dinner for 2 people came out to be $100. We had pizza, one drink & salads.. But at least the food was good & the service was pretty fast!

I also didn't see the other stuff on the menu, I'm not sure if all of the CPK's changed their menus, or maybe they shortened this menu to make it easier on the kitchen staff, but I was looking forward to some spring rolls & other stuff that I've had from a local CPK before."}
{"text":"I love CPK, but in this location the customer service is poor and the waiters are very rude and not friendly"}
{"text":"OMG staff of 9 people and no service. It's a Tuesday and slow in the restaurant . Figured service would be outstanding but unfortunately I went to the bar for a refill drink. Appetizer came 20 min after ordering only because I asked where  it was. The bar tender made great drinks and delivered them to the table . All and all it was better then cooking at home."}
{"text":"Went here with my sister and, although it is just CPK, it was a great experience. My sister and i shared a pizza. At first it was poorly cooked (soggy, the crust was still soft with some dough) and so we had them return it. The gentleman was kind enough to return in and made us a brand new one, crisp to perfection. It's no five start pizza, but the pizza was tasty and the service was great. It's vegas though, you gotta have good customer service skills! =D. 
While we waited we got a chance to watch the games (sunday). This CPK is located by the sports bar in the Mirage, so you get to see all the games going on while you enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Like many places on the Strip, it's hard to point to anything wrong with our meal here, but nothing stood out about the food or the service. The waiter was efficient, but he obviously was trying to spend as little time as possible taking care of us, despite the fact that our group of 11 made up nearly all of the customers in his section. I think the BBQ chicken pizza is still one of my favorites at any pizza place. The molten chocolate dessert also ranks very highly on my list of favorites anywhere. Locations in other cities were nicer than this one overall."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, took forever for the server to take are order.   Then when he did  it took him 15 minutes o bring are drinks.  Just terrible."}
{"text":"really not what I was expecting. I was expecting a pizza with a little difference in the taste.  that was not the case. they sometime tasted like something else. the Thai pizza if I close my eyes when taking a bite, gave me the impression that I was eating actual Thai food. there was another one that tasted like eating actual taco. real good suprise."}
{"text":"On our way to NY we stopped by for quick bite. We Ordered Vegetarian Pizza and The original chicken Pizza.. 
Pros: Order was prepared quickly than the usual time. Taste was far better than the typical airport food. 
Cons: Definitely an expensive place and dirty floor."}
{"text":"Asked for a table for 2, girl at the podium said it would be 15 minutes. There were plenty of open tables. We turned to go somewhere else when another hostess said she could seat us now, the first hostess rolled her eyes. Strike 1

We sat down and saw other tables, menu in hand, waiting to order. We overheard two waitresses arguing over being too busy and who would have to take our table. Strike 2 

Food took forever to come out. It was hardly warm and tasted bland. We had to hunt our nice but stressed out waitress down to pay our check. Strike 3

I've been a waitress before I get what it's like to be understaffed. It's the restaurants fault for not having more people on staff because otherwise the quality goes way down. Plus the food sucked"}
{"text":"My family and I just got back from a weekend in Vegas. We stayed in the Mirage and for dinner didn't want to go far since we were starving! We decided on CPK and boy did they disappoint. The pizza was good, but the service was horrible. The server took at aleast 10-12 min to even acknowledge our table. By that time we knew exactly what we wanted to order. The food took a good 25 min to come out. Not sure why everything was so slow. I get it's busy in Vegas, but they definitely don't know how to manage their time."}
{"text":"So, my wife and I were hungry after shopping at the Fashion Show Mall. I like coming here for their flatbreads and fresh salads (especially after eating rice for 5 straight days!). We got the mushroom and spinach flatbread ($5), bbq chicken salad ($10), and the fish tacos ($13.99). I like the flavors of their salads bc of the numerous ingredients they use. Their flatbreads are a good value for two people. However, I wouldn't order the fish tacos again. The fish portion was too small and the dish overall is not worth the price (It came with just chips and salsa). Overall, I think CPK is one of the good chain restos out there if you're looking for simple food but with interesting flavors.....or if you want a break from rice."}
{"text":"Had a fun time dining here with friends when we were in Vegas.

It was a fun break away from the mega buffet fest.

Great pizza, great service.  

And i remembered the total for a party of 3 was around $30; which was the same cost as what our buddies paid to eat at their buffet on the same night."}
{"text":"I like to fly into Charlotte. It's a good hub that isn't dreadfully large and difficult to navigate. My only complaint is the food stands here; I've seemingly never had a good meal on a layover.

In comes the California Pizza Kitchen...

I'm not going to get you all giggly thinking I'm going to say the food impressed me. No sir, not by any stretch of the imagination. But there were some bright clearings in the sky. First of, the service behind the counter was very professional and fast. Secondly, in addition to the core pizza kitchen restaurant, this location boasted not only a standard airport \"quick lunch\" kiosk attached to it, but a bar named \"Taste of Carolina\" that you could order CPK food from. I mean, I wouldn't (Pizza from California? Don't be ridiculous).

Having a bar in the bullpen is a super bonus when all of us miserable souls need to stuff ourselves in a plastic flying machine and chuck ourselves cross country at 30,000 feet. For me, it's a moot addition, considering I always keep a bottle of embalming fluid in my carry-on for sedation purposes so I can stomach the high cost and close proximity to the other miserable people (Relax. I only pack it in a clear container sized at 3 ounces or less).

Note: DO NOT drink embalming fluid."}
{"text":"Service was good...so was pizza....but the avacado eggrolls were amazing!..best eggrolls ive had..."}
{"text":"I took my sister here for lunch on Saturday. The host greeted us right away. It took a long time for our waitress to come and ask for our drinks. By the time our waitress came.. my sis and I already decided on our menu. The food (as usual) tastes amazing. Our waitress came by to ask if we needed anything and stuff. We had left over pizza so I asked for take out box and the waitress helped me out very nicely. Overall, CPK in fashion is friendly and less crowded than the one in townsquare. Really enjoy this place!!! Today was my 15th visit. And still loving it!"}
{"text":"California Pizza kitchen was one of the first restaurants that my family and I started going to after we change our diet to a plant based lifestyle.
 We always start with a bowl of the smashed pea and barley soup.. It's creamy and delicious. This is a vegan veggie broth based soup and I love that they also don't add any oil to the soup either.
 I also modify the tri colore pizza salad.
I ask for no cheese on the crust or on the salad , no dressing and add garbanzo beans, beets, and basil. I just ask for balsamic vinegar on the side.
 My girls and I also love the grilled veggie salad as well as whole wheat pasta with a variety of veggies. They have plenty of vegan options for the whole family. I usually just look at the ingredients on other items on the menu and create the perfect plant based meal.
 The wait staff is always happy to create what ever we like without one ounce of stink eye.
I also love that we can travel and to different states and get the same quality as well as great vegan choices we can trust."}
{"text":"The food was great, we ordered the club pizza along with the pesto pasta, everything was so tasty!"}
{"text":"Great service. Manager was extremely helpful and courteous. Food was delicious pizza was perfect and pasta was fantastic. I would come again and recommend others to come as well."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I am a sucker for non-cheesy, healthy-seeming (though probably not), non-traditional pizzas, and this is always a rare treat when I cross one of these places.....Thai chicken, BBQ chicken, thin crispy crust not smeared with grease and butter (that I can tell, chances are it's just folded in....).  All the smooth, gleaming surfaces and massive oven in the kitchen are mesmerizing.   Just avoid rush hour....."}
{"text":"I'm an executive chef from San Diego, Ca. I'm in vegas having a good time. I come in to get a pizza to go and I was treated like a worthless piece of crap because I was trying to order cheap. The man who served me was named Buddy. And if this were my resturaunt, I would have fired him. He was completely disrespectful and dosnt belong in a resturaunt. Food was good... but I was highly turned off by the service."}
{"text":"We moved our semi annual family dinner here as Friday's was unable to take reservations for our large group of 15. We had excellent service from Dan! He was cool and unflustered, humorous and professional. The whole group loved him. The management team helped a bit as we were so many, I didn't get the names but they were also a pleasure. The food of course was  delicious, too. We plan to return."}
{"text":"We only ate her because we were super hungry and we just arrived to Vegas. The food was good but the prices we're expensive compare to a regular CPK outside of a casino."}
{"text":"The service was nice, with our server being a good guy. The food was also good, with nice personal pizzas. I got the meat lovers pizza, and it was pretty oily. I knocked a star off because the price is a bit high (my pizza was 18.50)."}
{"text":"I was with my family, and we had a 3 hour wait for the plane. We decided to eat here. The greeter was nice, but the server was a bit forgetful. The pizza was cheaper than other cpk locals (14.30 bucks), but a lot smaller. The taste was also meh. I'd come here if you have a long layover"}
{"text":"Tasty pizza, service ok, very touristy and generic."}
{"text":"I am usually a fan of CPK but I wasn't too impressed with my food from this one. 
I was staying across the street at the Trump and was craving something other than what was on the room service menu, so decided to call in a pickup order from CPK. I ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza (which I have had before) and an order of their chicken dumplings. 
The Thai chicken was okay but not nearly as good as other times I have had it, and the chicken dumplings basically were just once mass of dumpling in the container so we just ate it like a casserole, and it wasn't too good, just tasted like grocery store variety pot-stickers.
Obviously since  just picked up I cant speak to the overall service of the place, but I can say that the takeout counter rep was not friendly, and seemed a bit annoyed that I was taking up part of her day. 
Again, I do typically like CPK and normally may give them a 4-4.5 rating, but this one earned a 3 at best."}
{"text":"I had the Cedar Plank Salmon and it was delicious, the spicy corn on the side complemented the salmon.  The Cobb Salad was equally great as well as the Spinach Artichoke Dip.  Our server was attentive and very patient!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here before flying home. It was as good as I'd expected. I love the food at CPK, but had never had breakfast here. 

I had an omlette and my friend had a breakfast pizza (which I wish I would've ordered!) It looked sooo good.  My omlette was okay, nothing to write home about. 

The coffee was really good. And it's served in a clear glass/coffee mug. Made me feel French for some reason. LOL....I'm weird.  

But yeah, I'd eat here again for breakfast. No complaints. Service was good and food was good."}
{"text":"HAve eaten here couple of times...nothing too special to rave about, we just like the food and it fills our tummy...the wait is sometimes ridiculous but what do you expect of Vegas?  LOL...one time we decided to sit at the bar because waiting for a table may take pretty long and we were both starving...the bar tender was pretty friendly to the guy eating next to us but ignored us the whole time...so minus 3 stars."}
{"text":"If there was an option to give a zero star rating then that would have been my choice.
We arrived as a party of five with no one in line.  THREE ladies at the hostess station are having a conversation with themselves and don't even notice (maybe by choice?) that we are standing right in front of them.  I ask if we should seat ourselves and were told it would be a ten minute wait. The restaurant was not full at all but there were clearly many tables that were not cleared after the last patron had left. A line starts to build behind us as none of the three hostesses helped to clear any tables.  Eventually, they disband from their conversations and start to contribute to the service of the restaurant. 
We are finally sat at a table 20 mins after arriving at a mostly empty restaurant.   The hostess takes us to our table and literally goes out of view from the front desk area to play video games on her phone.
Not a single server came by to greet us.   15 minutes later we catch the eye of a server who indicates he will be right with us.  Another ten minutes go by and nothing.  
We just got up and left at that point. 

I wasn't expecting first class service by any means but this was just unacceptable. Don't bother coming here unless you actually enjoy being neglected."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in yesterday to pick up a salad to go. This was my first visit.  Chloe the waitress was so pleasant, attentive and informative that we turned our visit into a mini date night!  The Morrocan salad was the bomb!"}
{"text":"GROSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE! The food was sooo disgusting... nothing like what i remembered CPK to be like :( We had the artichoke spinach dip it was cold then they took it back and put it in the microwave and it was still gross, the pizza had no flavor just a glump of cheese that didn't even have taste...WILL NOT GO BACK...save yourself the frustration."}
{"text":"Great food & service, more expensive then LA locations but reasonable for Vegas. Great location you have the casino around you along with the sports book atmosphere"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for dinner before the late Cirque du Soleil show. We were seated promptly but then, service was relatively slow. It looked as if our server had too many tables.

One nice feature is that half of the restaurant overlooks the giant sports betting area, which makes it fun to watch lots of games at once.



We both ordered cocktails and both thought they were extremely strong. Some people may like being served extra alcohol in their drinks but I could barely taste the mixers. It was like drinking straight vodka.

My Kung Pow Spaghetti was good but everything else was just average. Nevertheless, if you were hungry, it is a reasonably-priced place to have dinner at the Mirage."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an excellent breakfast here on a Sunday morning.  Rachel, our server, was truly excellent - an exceptional server.  They have a limited but good menu of omlettes, eggs, and a breakfast pizza.  My Mediterranean omelette was very good, as was my wife's eggs and bacon.  As mentioned service as well as the time to order and receive food was very good.  I'm not a regular to LAS Terminal 1, but I would return here for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is NOT nearly as good as the other California Pizza Kitchens we've been to, such as the one in Monterey, CA.

At this joint, one personal pizza and two beers cost $31, including the tip. A bit much, I'd say, even for an airport.

The pizza was okay, it had 4 slices - but the crust was soggy.

There must be better alternatives at this airport..."}
{"text":"Food and service are a joke! There is a reason their food is in the freezer isle. In fact the food they serve may have come from  Wal-Mart."}
{"text":"Had the Margharita pizza. it was decent not enough tomato sauce. Had to ask for extra sauce.  If not it would just be bread and cheese.  Held me over because flight delayed."}
{"text":"Everytime I fly through Vegas, I always end up at California Kitchen when I'm waiting to board a flight.

Like most business folks, I am in need of a quick meal and to use the free wifi to tap into my laptop.

I always seem to get asked to sit at the bar even though there are plenty of open tables in the dining room - specifically designed for single travelers (one to two chairs per table).

I always insist on having a table as I like to work and have space.

This visit, I was overcharged for food & given the incorrect order. When I informed my waitress that she gave me the incorrect order; she told me she'd take it back. My bill still came out incorrect & I had to request a refund.

I know that having a 'rush' of people come through can be a bit hectic but I really dislike being treated like cattle. It isn't too difficult to get an order right as well as a bill. Most people would not care about being charged $3-4 more but it never should've occured in the first place."}
{"text":"So, I've been to CPK SEVERAL times and NEVER have a problem, but I didn't have such a good experience this time.  Our hostess acted like she didn't care that we were there, mind you we were still an hour away from closing.  And, the table she sat us at was dirty, again, mind you, it's an hour from closing and there are TONS of tables available.

The saving grace was our waiter, who was spot on with our drinks and meals.  I like the fact that this CPK is in the Fashion Show mall, as it's quite convenient.  I hope in the future I have a better experience at this location."}
{"text":"First things first! The food was decent... Nothing too spectacular. It's just like every other CPK I've been to. The only difference being is the hiked up prices because of the restaurant being located on the Strip. That was expected, however the service we received was not!

I met up with a few friends who were visiting from out of town to get some dinner. My friends arrived before me and they were able to get a booth almost immediately. Great! I arrived a few minutes later and there were already waters at our table. They told me that our server wasn't the one who brought the waters to the table and were just told by the hostess that she would be with us in a few minutes. In fact, another server named Alberto was kind enough to keep refilling our waters throughout our meal. A for Alberto or A for awesome? \"A few minutes\" turned into almost 20 and our server finally came back to our table. She didn't even introduce herself or seem very friendly. To top it off, I felt rushed when she was taking our order. She was just overall not very personable. Our order came to the table in a decent amount of time, but we also had to ask for our complimentary bread that I'm assuming was supposed to be served upon arrival to the table. Hmmm... Maybe not? After our order arrived, we had only seen our server once throughout our meal. The last time we saw her was when she dropped the check off at the table! 

Anyways, our experience here was mediocre and I feel like it could've been so much better had our server been a bit more mindful of the vibe she was putting off. With that being said, I probably won't be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I care to claim but I'll tell you why I sometimes end up here.

1) I never go when there is a wait so it's always a breeze to get in and get out.

2) I often get hungry when I am in the sports book and, if you sit at the back bar of CPK, they have TVs so you can watch sports and eat at the same time.

3) The people are nice at the back bar and they will chat with you as you dine, but not in an annoying way.

4) If I just want a salad and maybe a cup of soup, this is a great option because CPK does overall have pretty consistently good salads (I love the Cobb).

5) It's easy and it's a lower-priced option than other places around.  Not that it's cheap but sometimes I just don't feel like getting up for a big fancy meal so I just go here.

I am sure I'll be back here again.  Just one note: I have never had the pizzas at this CPK but I am sure they are as you'd expect, and they do look good.  I can vouch for the soup and salad."}
{"text":"I have ordered take-out from this location two times now. The first time they told me my order would be ready by a certain time, and I showed up and waited a solid twenty minutes in the restaurant before it was ready. Considering all I ordered was soup and bread, and it was a lunch shift, I was pretty annoyed- but the employee was nice enough so I thought I'd write it off as a bad day. 
Today I placed my same order, soup and bread to go. I politely requested extra bacon and utensils/bread for two so my husband and I could share the soup. This time it was ready on time, but no extra bacon, bread, or utensils, and there were no napkins in the bag. I even tipped 2 dollars on an 8 dollar TAKE-OUT check. Disappointing. Is it really that hard to get a simple take-out order? Come on CPK."}
{"text":"We normally love CPK back home. However at this one the prices were inflated, the staff was not friendly, and our appetizer was cold and undercooked. Will not be coming to this location again."}
{"text":"I love shopping and planning my lunch around a meal at CPK. Never disappointing and the service is always spot on! Just had their new Buffalo Cauliflower. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This chain inside the Mirage Casino is great because it is located near the entrance facing the strip. The sports book is next door but you still don't smell all the cigarette smoke in here. I've gone here during lunch and enjoy their soup or salad and pizza deal. I usually get sat fast, the servers are friendly and I get my food out in a timely manner"}
{"text":"This was my first visit ever to CPK. I was here with my newborn and friend for a late lunch. We were greeted right away and sat in a booth that accommodated by baby carrier perfectly. The host helped me get the baby carrier in the booth and settled.  Our server came over and got our waters right away and helped recommend an adult beverage right away. She told me about the plum martini, so I decided to try it out. It was amazing!!! I'm usually disappointed when I go with a recommendation, but not this time. I only wish that my glass was a little fuller. It wasn't as full as it should have been. I ordered the BBQ chopped chicken salad. I ordered the half size. The salad came out promptly and looked tasty. The half size was huge. I added avocados to my salad. The salad had fresh lettuce and the BBQ chicken was tasty. The avocados were fresh too! The server was nice and it was a pleasant experience. The prices are ok... Not bad, but it was a little more than I expected."}
{"text":"Veronica might be the worst server I have ever had. The sports book next store has how many tvs? Not one had Sox Yankees on. Seriously? Lol the manager had to take my drink order because they were all in the weeds. Food was even worse. Sent back app... Go to the CPK at t Mobile location and ask for Derek he took great care of me on my last visit to a concert there. Mirage should be ashamed of themselves!"}
{"text":"Service  can be spotty here depending on how busy they are.

But other than that, a CPK located right in the middle of the casino floor!?! Pretty cool.

They have a great selection of appetizers, salads, pizzas, pastas and desserts. I've been a long time fan of CPK. My favs are the spinach and articoke dip, chinese chicken salad, and the California Club pizza. Almost everything I go to this establishment, if I'm with friends and family, we'll share a California Club. If I'm getting food for myself or going with one other person (like a boyfriend), most likely I'll be getting a salad.

Expect prices here to be a bit higher than normal. Afterall, you ARE eating a restaurant ON THE STRIP. I believe the California Club pizza was $16.50. My family and I also ordered a Hawaiian pizza and that was around the same price also."}
{"text":"from a vegan's perspective, california pizza kitchen isn't spectacular, but it's decent enough.  there's not a plethora of options here but the hummus appetizer is a must.  as for the pizza itself, i usually get the vegetarian pizza (without cheese and not on the honey wheat crust.)  it's good but i can make better at home.  

if you're in Vegas, this is one of the few vegan-friendy options."}
{"text":"Seated immediately upon arrival.  Just want understand why when asked what we want to drink (water with LEMON) they bring water.  I have to ask for lemon again and I get the \"stink eye\".  Here's a thought, just bring me what you think I should drink rather than asking what I would like to drink since it is to difficult to bring what I order.  Wife ordered the chopped salad.  She did not like it.  I had the Jambalaya pasta. It was good.  Had to ask for bread more than once.  Always fun to be told its in the oven only to see plates of it walk by to other tables.  Guess OUR bread was in the oven.  Maybe it was special bread for us?  Anyway nice that this restaurant is in the Fashion Show Mall."}
{"text":"Being from the East Coast and living in NYC I've never been curious about CPK. But stuck in an airport for a few hours and hungry, I decided to give it a try.

Comfortable seating area with a bar and the hostess saw me holding my laptop and automatically seated me near an outlet. Very nice. The service was really mixed though. I was asked to pay my bill while I was still eating (I wasn't eating slowly or anything). It was a pain because my hands were kind of greasy and pizza-covered.

The pizza is decent. The crust tastes like really high-quality frozen pizza though. I'd be very surprised if it was anything but just that. The toppings and combination were great and I scarfed the whole personal size pie down. 

Overall reminds me a bit of a higher-end Papa John's pizza. It can't really compare to a NYC slice -- chain pizzerias just get their own category and based on that, CPK is alright."}
{"text":"The food is run of the mill but if you need a meal before flight, it works. The service is ALWAYS VERY SLOW. Even when there's few in the place, it's s-l-o-w. Never enough servers and the ones here are racing around to keep up. My server's face today is all sweaty from racing around."}
{"text":"I was foolish to be hungry for something here!

My water had some pinkish creature or whatever it may be that happened to be swimming around. Disgusting!

Forks are definitely not spotless. Thank goodness I had a sandwich so I just used my hands."}
{"text":"Meh I have never been overwhelmed by great food here, it's just ok at any location I have ever been to... this one is no different. However the staff is very friendly we had a fabulous server today for lunch! The hostess could have been a bit more pleasant, it's unfortunate that she is the first impression of the establishment, but you don't have to manage that interaction for long. As I said our server was fabulous and friendly, very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. The atmosphere on their \"patio\" is great for people watching and we really enjoyed the setting. The server and setting is what gives this place a great rating the food (quality, price, and taste) and the less than desirable hostess knocks the overall rating down for me."}
{"text":"Rita Rocks? 
Jamie is beyond amazing?
I am so so so happy with this magical meal, magical service, kindness... THE BEST PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE ON THE PLANET!!!
The best service on the planet!!!!
So grateful for this dynamic meal!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite before the LOVE show and ordered a Maine Lobster Flatbread which was outstanding as well as the dumplings....very good. Great Service and just a nice quick spot. Pizza's and other food I saw being delivered around me looked amazing !"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time recently and I thought the pizza was delish!  I liked the modern feel of this place and even though it was pretty busy, we were seated within 10 minutes.  Our server was pretty good, but could have been better so I knocked off half of a star.  I also knocked off half of a star because of the price.  I think the pizza is very good, but just wish it was cheaper.  I mean, c'mon the BLT pizza just had lettuce, one tomato slice on it some mayo and crumbled bacon on it.  I love bacon and BLT's and thought the pizza was good.  I also tried a small tiny piece of cheese pizza from my son's lunch and it was pretty good too.  All in all, I will go back but only when I am wanting to splurge a little on a meal."}
{"text":"Choosing a healthy lifestyle!! Quinoa Arugula Salad with chicken was the best!! I really enjoyed it!  Michael our server was sweet!! Fast and simple lunch!!"}
{"text":"There pizza is great here but i think it is a little pricey its like 12$ for a little pizza not really worth it the service is good here and the pizza tasts great just to much money to go here a lot."}
{"text":"Greeted immediately :) place is clean and smells delicious :) the white pizza is awesome, as well as their cocktail menu. Try the agave Margarita !"}
{"text":"I am not ashamed to admit it..........I am freaken obsessed with this place. I am no doubt California Pizza Kitchen's biggest fan. I especially love this location in the Mirage because of course Mirage is my favourite hotel when I go to Vegas. 

They have a mind blowing menu with something for everyone but I am stickler for what I like and I don't stray too far away from it. In fact I never stray away from it. I make it a point to go twice everytime I go to Vegas cuz the first night I just have to have the traditional Bbq chicken pizza. This is the pizza that put them on the map. So good especially if you love chunks of chicken, bbq sauce, cilantro, red onion and lots of cheese. Yummy! The second night I have to have their Kung Pao spaghetti. Absolutely amazing. It is spicy I must warn you but well worth it. A must try if you never have. It is so good I bought the CPK cookbook and the recipe for Kung Pao spaghetti is in there so one day I intend on giving it a try myself. 

Service is always consistently excellent and I have never once had a crappy meal. Hands down on my top ten restaurants list and will never get knocked off of it!!"}
{"text":"Bad service- rude hostess when we asked for a bigger table. Slow service- waited 20 mins before my water came out. Bad food- dip came out cold, and my pasta was bland..."}
{"text":"Should of looked at the reviews before we walked in. Our experience didn't end with the food or the portions but how we didn't get our food after 50 minutes, until I asked the smart ass reception for the check, the food comes out. Table next to us came in the same time we did, order taken around the same time the waitress took ours. They ate and finished there meal before ours came in. Table #2 far right to us came in 10mins after we did, they received there food, pizza like we ordered. After complaining to the only relevant person in there, the waitress. . She has the nerve to sit there and lie, saying it was only 2 minute difference. Look, I'm just here like everyone else voicing my experience with this establishment. From the looks at it, I don't think anyone from CPK cares. They obviously haven't done anything to better their reviews. 2 star overall, wow! They certainly don't care about the people they hire!"}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a $22 pitcher of Stella and a yummy filling pizza!  Perfect view of all your favorite games but still maintains a sophisticated air around it.  Great pizza,  environment, and service. Definitely came back and will come again!"}
{"text":"I frequent California Pizza Kitchen in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, so when my mom suggested going to this CPK, while on vacation in Las Vegas, I said, \"... but I can go there any time.\" Other members of our traveling group had never experienced CPK, so we ended up giving this one a shot. Sorry for the pun, but it was worth the gamble.

While waiting in line for seating, I changed my mood and looked forward to the meal, wanting to order my favorite CPK meal, Chicken Milanese. Sadly, when I finally got a chance to open my menu, there was no Chicken Milanese listed! The California Pizza Kitchen website lists the dish as one of its specialties, so this came as a surprise.

I went for my second favorite option (again, not pizza), the Original BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad, dressing on the side. I split it with my neighbor, who ordered the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza. The pizza was fine but the chicken in the salad, moist as it was, lacked enough BBQ sauce and thus zing that usually accompanies the crisp, fresh combination of ingredients in this salad. 

My table asked for the sourdough bread to eat while waiting for the food. We got a pathetic hole/airy looking loaf along with some cold butter. We ate it and asked for more - no carb concern here, especially on vacay - and the second serving was better. 

The wait staff took care of our requests with smiles and also refilled our waters and drinks regularly. Nonetheless, the food failed to match up to the standards that other CPK's have accustomed me to. My group, including first timers, enjoyed the experience overall, so I think they will be pleasantly surprised by the California Pizza Kitchen experience at home."}
{"text":"I'm surely a fan of CPK! I sorta grew up with it.  Well okay since college, which still seems like forever.  A fusion of asian, american, italian...  It almost has something for everyone to enjoy.

Last nite I had:

Garlic Chicken pizza.  The garlic are roasted and a little sweet. Not oily.  I didn't have a bad garlic breath or any lingering throughout the nite.  

The crab cakes came with 2 pieces.  In the center they have a salsa mix with beans, which is good together.

I'm surely going to update this.  Service is great.  They have beers and specialty drinks.  So many memories of birthday dinners with friends.  Its just a nice casual spot to dine = 0) ENJOY!"}
{"text":"They have wonderful food and great service stop in there every time I go down to Las Vegas! I have had the pizza down there and their chicken fettuccine and not had a bad meal there. Would recommendGoing to California pizza kitchen anytime you ever are at the Mirage."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Ask fo Sara, We always go to her section. Shes a great server, friendl and knowlegable. She is aa assest to that place"}
{"text":"By far one of the nicest looking CPKs I've eaten at. Maybe because it's pretty new at the Town Square. The food was even better than other CPKs I've been to--especially the pasta. Usually, my expectations aren't that high for a CPK, but this time, they exceeded beyond my wildest imagination. The service was very friendly and attentive too. Definitely the location to go to in Vegas."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and it's enjoyable each time.  The pizza, the salad, and the service are all excellent."}
{"text":"California pizza kitchen at the fashion show mall our waitress Michele did an excellent job the food was very good and the restaurant was a good place to eat at 3200 las vegas blvd. S. In Las Vegas Nevada"}
{"text":"This is a good enough place to eat after you gorge yourself with other Vegas eats. Specialty pizzas can be good or bad, depends on if it's your thing or not. I wouldn't call it REALLY GOOD pizza but if you're looking for something familiar to satiate your appetite, plop yourself into a booth that faces that casino floor, order a pie, sit back and relax. 

Located smack dab in the middle of the Mirage casino, you can't miss it."}
{"text":"Nasty nasty nasty.   Pizza came cold and with slimy old basil on top of the margarita pizza.  Service was  V E R Y  slow.  Gross place to eat.   Some much staff and no one helped the customers.   Waited 20 min just to pay.  Waited 15 at the table for someone to show up to take the order    Never again!"}
{"text":"Good fast friendly service ,food was better than most airport food and a bar with top shelf liquor not the normal overpriced rail drinks and much better than a sports bar nobody needs buffalo wings before getting on a plane!"}
{"text":"Same menu, service is fine, most often very attentive - but you have to ask for bread and butter, the servers don't just give it to you.

Here are my favorites:

Spinach & Artichoke Dip appetizer
Thai Crunch salad
BBQ Chicken Pizza
Pear Gorgonzola Pizza
Garlic Chicken Pizza
$16.95 Jambalaya Pasta ** MOST FAVORITE DISH here (although pricey)
$6.95 - Mushroom Flatbread (on their Lunch Menu - delicious and well worth the price! b/c it comes with a BIG side salad too)
Clam Linguini


The past few times I've been here was for the Yellow Ticket Promotion where the managers reveal a prize (ranging from 10%, 20% or 50% off meal, free frozen pizzas for a year, and cash prizes). One of my friends got the 50% off coupon so I ordered a few things I've never tried, one being the 

Japanese Eggplant Pizza on whole wheat dough (eh, it wasn't that great, and I'm glad I got it for 50% off)

CPK food is overpriced, but if you haven't tried the jambalaya pasta, please do next time you go, because it's really great :)"}
{"text":"This location is inside the Las Vegas McCarran International Airport.

As airport service and food goes I am usually skeptical...bad service and overprices seem to be the rule... NOT so at this location..

I was immediately seated and Michelle, the waitress, was very attentive. I received prompt and courteous service with a smile, which she had for her other patrons, too.

My order arrived prompt and hot. My coffee was always warmed up nicely.

Thank you for good service during my trip. I will return to this location next time I have a wait time in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Used to love CPK when I first discovered it in the early 90s and remember when this one location opened at the time at the Mirage. Well, it had been years since I had one pizza here but I was at the Mirage at the beginning of a trade show and I was first heding to the Mirage's buffet but with a $45 sticker price, I began to look for alternatives. Alternatives are not plenty here and I stumbled upon this place and though I would give a try for old times sake!

My friend and I were not that hungry so I suggested that we share a pizza \"Pear and Gorgonzola\". It was good and one was plenty for both of us as we could not finished it. At $15 for two, it turned out to be a much better deal than the buffet (which would have been $90 for two!).

I would not make a detour to come to a CPK anymore but it is still an acceptable option!"}
{"text":"Good pizza that's consistent. Staff isn't personable but what do you expect from an airport restaurant? Fast service is what you expect and that's what you get here."}
{"text":"The food is the same as any CPK location. This location is overpriced, crowded, loud, under staffed, and just not worth walking through the smoky casino to get to. They can't really fit a party more than 6 without splitting up the group."}
{"text":"I ordered a pesto chicken pizza to go and ate a red velvet cake there. It was moist and soft but the frosting was a little bit too sweet for me. While waiting at the bar for our pizza the waiter got confused and gave our pizza to the customers dining in. So we have to waited another ten to fifteen extra minutes for our pizza, but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Good food but I ate a $18 pizza by myself and could have continued. Overpriced even for Vegas in my opinion."}
{"text":"tldr

True served us, very fast food prep

Get:
-BBQ chicken pizza
-Kung pao spaghetti with shrimp"}
{"text":"Haven't had CPK in years and really enjoyed this location. They still carry many original dishes that aren't around anymore. They are located inside of the Fashion Show mall But easy to find if you park by Dillard's. The service we received both times from Ashley A. Was wonderful!!! She's a California native like myself and truly does make you feel welcome. She made sure our orders were on point and made great suggestions for us to try. The manager Jamie also checked up on us often. They were busy behind the bar and my cocktail did take some time to arrive and she comped the beverage which was unnecessary but a nice surprise. They also treated us to a lovely dessert which was wonderful and unexpected. They truly do go above and beyond when it comes to customer service and ensure their guests are happy. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were traveling to the other side of the country and we had a layover for a few hours. We wanted to sit down and have something to eat so we went to the newer section of the McCarran Airport in Las Vegas because this CPK seemed reasonable to comfortably take our time and eat lunch because it's the only large dine-in type restaurant in the airport. 

It seemed they were understaffed when we went, so the service wasn't great, but I'm not upset about it because it was a holiday weekend and I'm not expecting excellent service at an airport anyways. Their menu is smaller than what you'd find at a typical CPK location but they have most of the popular items. We shared a Caesar salad and the BBQ Chicken Pizza. The portion sizes are also slightly smaller but it filled us up and we were happy with the meal."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service. Waiter was rude and inattentive. We had to ask him multiple times for water and he gave preferential treatment to other customers who showed up much later than we did. I do a lot of traveling and I can guarantee I won't be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Food is great. Our waiter went our of the mall, to het whitening tips and neglected us. I had to go to bar to het my drink."}
{"text":"Wow has this food chain slid off the cliff, not just this location but all of them.The Great Recession was not kind to this franchise.

Ten years ago you had to wait in line to get your slice of overpriced pizza and pasta. Now days you can walk right in ... laugh at the food ... and bounce like we did!

Last one out the door turn the lights off!"}
{"text":"Ate here on 12/26/16, for our second night during our four day vacation. Place was pretty busy but we got seated within a short amount of time. Took a little bit of time to get our drink order in, took even more time to get our drinks. Once they came out the lady refilling them was very attentive and friendly, saw her more often than our waitress.

Everything we ordered, including the complimentary bread, took a long time to arrive at the table. Food was  good, would of been better if hadn't taken quite so long. Overall had a decent experience here, quite a good amount of televisions and great view of the sport book area TV's as well, which was perfect for watching the Cowboys/Lions game that night .

Might give it another try next time, not sure."}
{"text":"No complaints about the food, but the service is another story. We were never given the complimentary bread when we arrived, so when the manager came out with the pizza we ordered we asked if we could get some of the bread. He very rudely asked if we had requested it from our waitress because apparently \"at this location you have to do a special request for it\". I have been to this location many times before and have never had to \"request it.\" But regardless, we then politely asked if we could have some. He was very rude, especially for being a manager, during this time. Couple minutes later, we see waitresses bringing the bread to tables surrounding us. We asked some of the tables if they did a \"special request\" for the bread or if it was just given to them. Shocker...it was just given to them! Not sure why the manager couldn't have just happily brought us the bread, said sorry your waitress forgot I'll be right back with some!, or responded in any sort of professional manner. While the food is good, I'd rather eat somewhere where I feel welcomed. There are endless eating options on the Strip so I definitely won't be back here."}
{"text":"Had their artichoke & spinach spaghettini. Tasted good overall."}
{"text":"It just gets worse and worse the last 3 times I've gone the next day I'm sick with diarrhea . They only speak Spanish in the kitchen so they're all Mexicans and the public health department needs to visit them.  Are they really try to poison me? How can food be this bad that my friend and I are both sick the next morning after the dinner at California Pizza. Hiring drop outs from school will only ruin a Restarant ! It's upsetting that this used to be a good place to eat and now the quality is so bad!"}
{"text":"Not really pleased that special requests were not accommodated.... My friend has a shrimp allergy, and the waitress seemed unconcerned. She did not offer to go and ask the kitchen about possible safer options. She just told us to be careful what we ordered.

When our food arrived, after we waited almost 30 minutes in the nearly empty restaurant, my macaroni and cheese was only warm, and looked slightly congealed. Ugh. The service was the slowest I have ever experienced and none of the waiters/waitresses seemed interested in refilling glasses.
 
Skipped dessert and left after waiting to pay the bill...."}
{"text":"Had to grab a quick bite before going to see the \"Love\" show so decided to stop in. There was a long line waiting to be sat even though there were quite a few open tables, maybe they were under staffed. Sat down and realized it was a different menu that normal CPK and there is not a kids menu - warning for all those traveling with children. Service was really slow, we only got to get our appetizer and had to cancel a pizza even though we were there an hour & a half."}
{"text":"Tasteless, noisy, pricey, quite slow...
But the staff is nice and the draft beers are good (blue moon for instance)"}
{"text":"Pretty fast, pre-frozen and perfectly forgettable.

With bar seating, sit down seating and a to-go line, this is one of the most hoppin' restaurants in the D Concourse. There's not much better in this part of the airport, though, so best of luck!

FYI: They offer half-priced shots at the bar with the purchase of a beer, so don't think your liver is going to get a break until you step on the plane."}
{"text":"This franchise is always good and consistent--can't really go wrong.  This one gets special notice due to its proximity to the Mirage sports book, which is still my favorite.  Prices have climbed over the years, but not too badly.  Can't go wrong with the pizzas and salads.  Bread and butter are good compliments."}
{"text":"Wow! What a fantastic experience! Great service. Fantastic food. So worth a native braving the strip on a Saturday! Eat here!!"}
{"text":"We love this pizza but we  wish it had more pepperoni on the supreme pizza. We always eat here at least twice while we are in Vegas. It's location is right next to the sportsbook inside the Mirage casino, you can choose to eat at the restaurant or carry out. Today we decided to carry out and eat in the sport book area. Yes, we are eating pizza for our Thanksgiving Day dinner."}
{"text":"It's not about an experience here it's about the food. Everything is virtually gourmet or can be made to your likings. The place is well lit enough and has a great atmosphere for bigger groups and families. We had a party of 7 and they accommodated us perfectly. No reservations and very professional staff awaits your visit. California Pizza is one of kind place to get your grub on. 

For starters we tried the avocado club egg rolls and wanted to stop eating the rest of them but could not resist. Next we tried out their Thai pizza and it was delicious. Overall great food and had a good time with friends and family. The child was happy with his wood fired personal size pepperoni pizza as usual Good times!

{"text":"By far the worst spinach and artichoke we have ever had, no flavour, looked to be only spinach olive oil and a little garlic, was gross.
Had the favourite bbq chicken pizza; very small portion came out, which was cold aswell, pizza never had cheese, chicken was old and dry, and the crust wasn't fully cooked, seems like since it was later in the evening they figure they're dealing with drunk people and can make bare minimum over priced food, or the chef is doing key bumps towards the end of his shift, horrible service too, stick to papa johns if you want a pizza joint"}
{"text":"I just wasn't that into it, but it was an alright experience.

After walking around the Fashion show mall, we decided to eat at the highly acclaimed CPK. Expecting large portions, we decided to get one salad and two pizzas (\"The Works\" and \"California Club\" pizzas). As we waited for order, the waiter gave us bread. I was kind of thrown off when we got out bread because the \"sauce\" was simply olive oil and pepper. It's probably nothing because I not usually a \"fancy\" person ... But oh well, it was free so I couldn't really complain. As our food came, I honestly thought that they gave us random appetizers, but no it was our pizza (it was very ... Small). The salad was better than I thought it would be, so that's a plus. Anyway, it wasn't a traditional \"Pizza Hut\" pizza, so I liked how original it was. The service was great and the area was clean."}
{"text":"Read my posts long enough and you'll find I review a lot of pizza places searching for the perfect fit.  While CPK doesn't give me Friday night cravings it is one of my favorite lunch spots on the strip.

The lettuce wraps and BBQ Chicken pizza here are always consistently solid.   I can always eat a pizza by myself no problem because the taste is always on par each and every time.

Being from the mid-west I prefer thick crust over thin almost all the time, but it's hard to find a better BBQ Chicken pizza than CPK."}
{"text":"What can I say???  This place is awesome!  I am never disappointed with the Chopped Salad and the always classic BBQ Chicken Pizza.  The last time I went, we were also encouraged to try the Butter Cake for dessert.  The menu's description of this newer dessert says, \"Just trust us!\"  We did and there were no regrets!"}
{"text":"We love the pizza and desserts here!!
Everytime I visit this location I am greeted with a smile and the service is always great! I love the variety of pizza, pasta, sandwiches and desserts. My favorite is the 3 Cheese and Tomato, my husband loves the Hawaiian, and of course we LOVE the BUTTER CAKE!!! The butter cake is my husbands favorite dessert of all time, yellow cake served warm with a scoop of Hagen Daaz vanilla ice cream...DIVINE! The pizza is always super fresh and the crust is perfect! If you've never been, be sure to check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Nice location inside the fashion show mall. Came for lunch on a Friday with a friend, we were greeted and seated immediately. Our waiter was very nice and service was great!! The pizza was OK but the warm hospitality from our server made up for it. All the staff were very nice!"}
{"text":"They were open late for dinner say around 1:30 AM, the service was fast and the cleaning was great. Loved the place and prices were moderate and not very expensive."}
{"text":"Not so fresh anymore, chicken pizza is so yesterday, but the menu is extensive and has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Everything about this place seems to be a lesser version of a normal CPK: the menu is abbreviated, the pizza seems small, and the taste is missing. Prices however remain to be the same or higher than other franchise locations. Avoid this place if you can."}
{"text":"CPK in Vegas is the same in LA. The servers were very attentive and we never had an empty water glass. :D ENJOY!"}
{"text":"We opted for breakfast when we should have opted out.

The waitress was not friendly or personable at all.

Florentine omelet was gross. to the point that it was oozing raw egg and overflowing with garlic. 
The bfast burrito was ok, but tasted similar to something from the dollar menu.

Not that there are many options at the airport, but come on! You would think that a chain like this would want to be the stand out place...sadly they were overshadowed by any and all other places."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. Their gluten free pizza wasn't fully cooked. My water was empty up until the check. And when the chef came out to talk to me about my pizza, he spoke to me as a child and he snapped at me to get off of my phone. I was in the middle of writing an email for work and didn't see him approach the table. I wasn't there during a high volume time and I was alone. My food and meal shouldn't have taken almost an hour. Rude, poor quality food, and will not be returning."}
{"text":"It's hard to find something decent for restaurants at the airport. Le Vegas Intl airport is no different. They do have a California Pizza Kitchen that you can sit down and enjoy a meal and as you can expect, they are a bit pricey. Every airport restaurant has a costly overhead to deal with and that of course is passed on to the customer. So it it seems like a waste of time to complain about how expressive a restaurant is at the airport.  As for a CPK, they don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food but took awhile to serve. I love their bbq chicken salad and their margarita pizza. I never get tired of their food."}
{"text":"What a hot mess this place was. I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before I went. We were in a hurry at the airport and grabbed what was close. My Bloody Mary is tomato juice and hot spices with a dried up piece of celery for garnish. No alcohol. My friends mojito same, he kept saying it tasted like soda water. The pizza I had was kinda dry and had some unidentifiable toppings on it. I realize the airport versions of restaurants are not the same, but..man this was gross."}
{"text":"Had 60 min to kill in terminal D, so to CPK it was! The place has a bunch of bar seats and has a gigantic window facing the runway, so no windowless, lonely, eating in the dark for you, Champ! The menu isn't a full CPK menu and everything feels a bit lazy (I'm not sure if they have a full kitchen), but it's better than eating Johnny Rockets before you pack yourself on a 500MPH flying tube. Picked up a pesto chicken 'wich which was passable and a Stella that wasn't from a skunk tap. Can you really ask for more in an airport? Oh, yea, I guess you can, but this isn't so bad either."}
{"text":"Tried the Chipotle Chicken Pizza (without the chicken) and a few appetizers. All the dishes were quite good. The service was prompt too. 

The place is right near to Casino in Mirage -- and makes it for a fun Vegas ambience :-) 

Do try the place out if you are in mood for italian food in vegas :)"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken Picata  and it was delicious; chicken was nicely seasoned, tender, and juicy....sauce had a good consistency and lots lemon capers that makes takes the noodle up another notch taste wise. This dish was way better than Kahala Mall CPK. Server Ryan provided an awesome service. High five and a big shaka!"}
{"text":"Me being an avid fan of pizza, I would probably would put this under an OK review.  The place was in the middle of Mirage, some where and of course it was packed.  We were hoping to beat the long lines, but unfortunately the lines were long, no matter how early we went before lunch.  We were there to buy show tickets and wanted to check it out.  I never been to the California Pizza Kitchen before.  So why not.  

The place itself, seem smaller then I expected to be for a Pizza Parlor.  So you got people standing in line, waiting on tables, cause the place was jammed packed.  Not sure how long we waited but a good 30 minutes that went by and didn't really see the front of the line.  But they had staff going around, asking if there was a party of two, which was the wife and I.  Kind of felt bad that we had to pass up those before us.  But we were told that it would be right in front of the bar.  So its not an actual table, its the bar.  The place you actually sit at, to see people pour you a beer right in front of you.  So, not only was it awkward to go before others, but kind of awkward to be sitting next to a beer fountain and eat pizza, especially if your not drinking beer.  Overall, the place is easily crowded and not as roomy, but it probably be nicer, if it was less crowded.  

We had California Pizza Frozen Pizza before, in which I probably would prefer the frozen pizza over the pizza parlor.  The pizza was okay, but seem a bit flatter then the frozen pizza.  Getting a personalize size pizza, is kind of cool, but I wasn't really digging it as much.  It look like, they did take their time cooking it, but it did look like they just threw it all together and toss it in the oven.  Not knowing if the peperoni is sticking together or stacked.  But it was edible, and it did feel me up.

If you do ever get a chance, probably go when its not busy.  Probably get a table that hasn't have some one pouring a glass of beer in front of you every 5 minutes.  Otherwise, your probably better off with the frozen version.   But if I came here in better circumstances, then maybe, I'll like it more."}
{"text":"Awesome food decent prices and always friendly service. Thai chicken pizza is my favorite.  5% cash back if you use a Chase bank card to pay."}
{"text":"The asparagus / arrugula salad is a keeper.

Here's a tip:  order your pizza thin crust.  The texture and crsipness will make a difference every time.  Add a cold frosty beer and sit on the sidewalk in the mall.  5 Star \"people watching\" place!"}
{"text":"California Pizza Kitchen is always one of my top places to go to whenever I go out to dinner with my family. The portions are large enough for a family to share. My family and I shared the half portion of the BBQ Chicken Salad, which always flavorful. Added avocado as well! We also got the Shrimp Pesto Penne. Perfect amount of sauce, shrimp is cooked perfectly. One of the best pastas hands down. We usually always get the BBQ Chicken Pizza, but decided to try something different. We went with the Thai Chicken Pizza! And it was a good choice. Could have used a little more chicken though. And then ended with the Salted Caramel Pudding, which is dangerously good. Overall, 5 stars! 

Also, love the new renovation! Definitely would come in for happy hour with the new set up!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised! I mean the food was just on point tonight. Idk maybe it's just me cause of my cravings but damn it was delicious, the prices were higher of course since the location is in the mirage and on the strip,not surprised. I ordered the wild mushroom pizza, deliciously aromatic mushrooms sautéed to perfection. I also ordered the Chinese chicken salad. Amazing! It was a perfect blend of bitterness from the cabbge to the sweetest of the dressing, the crunch from the wonton chips and the fresh green onions.great night to come to cpk !"}
{"text":"It was my boyfriend and I first time here, and we had an amazing waitress! Her name was Abby we really recommend her for your first time she was really patient with us and answered all our questions and told us the details of the food. And once we got our food it was delicious as she said it was gonna be! Thanks Abby!"}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, I thought it was okay.  They had a wide selection of foods, and if you go to the sit down/bar area, they also have a wide selection of drinks.  I was lucky enough to get a table near an outlet (the server was very nice, and found one for me), and the service here was great!  The food was okay, and the price was what I would expect from an airport, but I definitely didn't think the food was as good as a regular CPK restaurant outside the airport.  If you log onto the airport WiFi, you get 45 minutes for free (although it's slow), so it's a nice spot to sit and get work done if it's not too busy."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place and for some reason we would always end up going somewhere else. Im so glad we finally decided on staying and trying this place out. The service was excellent, Shelly was our server, she was a ray of sunshine and very attentive :) our drinks were never empty. 

We ordered a pepperoni pizza and a pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza without oregano. The pizzas didn't take very long to cook but when they came one of our pizzas that had no oregano was made wrong. The server was completely apologetic about the goof up, even called the manager over to talk to us.  
Diane ( hope i spelled her name right ) went the extra mile and bought the one pizza that was made wrong for us. Aside from the slight goof, the pizzas were so good. Glad we took the time out to try this place out."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 7 the hostess accommodated us quickly. Overall the service was good, and the food was even better. 
To eat you start off with a bread and some olive oil, yum! To eat we ordered three pizza's to share as well as a salad. 
The pizzas were all great, a meat-lover one that we ordered was very greasy which is understandable considering all the meat on it. The salad on the other hand was very small considering how cheap lettuce is, they could give you a better portion of the salad. 
If you're stopping by the casino and want a quicky bite to eat give this place a try."}
{"text":"We've done CPK before, but this was our first visit here.  We had a \"sync\" special through our credit card (we synced elsewhere on the web and this deal was \"loaded\" onto our card by the credit company).  So we paid a visit!

The pizza was as good as I remember.  And as small.  I love the spicy Sicilian, even if it is thin crust. The food came fast. And even though we had to ask for more bread, the service was good.  There were three of us, and we finished 1.5 pizzas (the Sicilian, and a mushroom, sausage and pepperoni).  The pizzas are just a bit small.  But the flavor is very good.

One complaint would be that the bread service was cold.  I like my bread warm from the oven!  The bread was good, but warm would have been better."}
{"text":"I have both done take out and dined in at this California Pizza Kitchen located at Legacy Village and both experiences were positive. The online ordering system is very easy to navigate, and the food was ready quickly. When I sat down and ate here, the service was satisfactory. The good thing I've found about this place is that either way, the food is going to be good! If you've never been to a CPK, the feel is casual, but upscale for a 'pizza place'.

The pizza here does not have to be your typical if you don't want it to be. They have many interesting topping combinations on their specialty pizzas. My go-to pizza at CPK is the California Veggie. It has broccolini, eggplant, roasted corn, and sun dried tomatoes.

If you're not feeling pizza, there's different options like pasta, chicken and seafood dinners, entree salads, and a variety of appetizers and small plates. My favorite appetizer is the spicy buffalo cauliflower! Amazingly good and actually spicy.

If you're out in Legacy and are looking for something to eat, definitely come here if you've never tried it."}
{"text":"Been to this CPK tons of time (I come to Vegas atleast once a year), the food is really cooked well but the service has to be improved a lot. 

The joint is in Mirage where the footfall is heavy but clearly from other reviewers also the service is pretty slow and rude. Our service experience was ok, nothing great. The food was awesome (specially the pastas) but please improve the service !!"}
{"text":"California Pizza Kitchen has never been one of my \"go-to\" per say places however I didn't mind coming here earlier this week. This location is inside of the Mirage Hotel & Casino situated next to the Sportsbook! I really think it's convenient that they offer the \"to-go\" option on one of the sides of the restaurant for those people who would like to order their food and head back to their seats for the game! When I arrived I was a bit confused as to where I was initially suppose to order but the manager was gracious enough to take my order in the \"non designated \" spot. Service was good from the little interaction I had with the staff and the food was just okay. I was instantly reminded that the reason I never really eat at CPK is it's not worth the price. The spinach and artichoke dip that we ordered I believe we got ripped off something wicked on the amount of actual dip. For $13 and some change I wasn't impressed, and of course they give you 6 bags of tortilla chips with 3 ounces of dip... Other than that it was cool I guess."}
{"text":"The server was awesome and the place was clean. What I remembered from the old CPK was the Jamaican jerk pizza was awesome. This time it fell a little flat. The crust was burnt and reminded me of box pizza. Don't get me wrong it was still pretty good I just remembered it a bit differently. But the real reason for the 3 star bc nothing really deserved it was the shear fact that within a couple hours I swelled up like a wet diaper. I had to remove my shoes it was that bad. Outside of that the service and staff were great. Maybe next time if we come I'll order something a little different and probably healthier :)"}
{"text":"Not the best place to dine in Vegas, or the Mirage... I wouldn't suggest dinning here. I have eaten at much better CPK's all across the USA."}
{"text":"Breakfast: Menu is small for breakfast, but it has all the usual egg dishes. The meals are full meals with eggs, toast, meat, and potatoes/fruit. The prices are some of the cheapest in the D gate area. Coffee needs some improvement, but was hot. 

Service was good."}
{"text":"Located inside the airport in Las Vegas.

This place was okay... people just sitting and having drinks, Dave's mom and dad got some beer and wine and we chatted.

The place wasn't super busy, and I didn't notice any servers. Considering this is inside the airport it is a tad pricey."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're in a hurry! Slow service, and food takes forever. The pizza itself wasn't horrible."}
{"text":"My favorite place for pizza and salad. You gotta try the Chinese chicken salad and get the blt pizza (not on the menu). So good!"}
{"text":"I generally like the California pizza kitchen they have decent food. The menu here is considerably smaller than a normal location. That was kind of disappointing.

The real hit was the wait service. The waitress meant well but she really needs to be fired. Competence was a serious issue. Order was messed up. Of the three entrees we ordered (and the waitress wrote down on a notepad) only one of them made it to our table. The other was forgotten. When we mentioned it to the waitress she looked at her notepad and realized she had not properly put in our order. Additionally, while it was busy she moved very slow, had difficulty keeping up, and at a few points (like when we needed to request our check to get to our gate for our flight) was hard to find."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Mirage, and just came back from a show, so we needed a place to eat after it, and didn't want to go too far. We decided to come here since it was close and it was open.  Unfortunately, I should have just sucked it up and went somewhere else.  

CPK is a chain, so I knew that the food here would not be too bad, and it wasn't.  The service is the main reason for my 2 star review. There was no line when we first arrived.  There were plenty of booths open, but we got seated in the center of the restaurant... which was really awkward.  I asked to be seated at a booth, and the hostess gave me a dirty look and told me \"I guess, if you want\".  So... I've been a hostess before, and I know to never turn down a guest if there is no reservation for the table.  The server may be double-seated, but it was not busy there, in fact, there were only a few tables there that were even seated and they all had their food, so I think it was manageable.  We waited there for about 10 minutes until someone came to greet us.  And then another 10 to get waters.  When she took our order, I didn't feel like she was extremely friendly.  This might be because it was towards the end of her shift, but I didn't like it. 

Again, the food here is not bad, it is pretty good (although I think this has an abbreviated menu). Beware of the service here."}
{"text":"What is the big deal about this place?

When I came here I was expecting great things, but it disappointed.

I dont like dry pizza or no taste. It felt like someone took bread and then sprinked toppings on top of it and stuck it into the oven. The sauce wasn't special, the toppings weren't special. 

Selection is nice but it seems like a mixture of things put together.

Their pasta was pretty good, which is for the stars. But for the thing they are known for (pizza) I cannot say it was great at all. Especially for the price. I dont like it."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the service was slow and unmemorable.  We left three big daiquiri glasses with blue flashing lights at the table when we left, and when we returned a little while later, the waiter 1) didn't remember serving us (ok, that's understandable) & 2) didn't remember finding THREE GIANT BLUE FLASHING CUPS!  C'mon, it's Vegas, but at least that should have stuck in your head...

I'll stick with the frozen pies, my friends..."}
{"text":"I just got to the airport and was looking for some breakfast. CPK sounded like a good idea... But wasn't. 

The hostess was on a terrible mood, she was writing down the names so people can get a table. Took more than 10minutes so she start calling names... The detail was: the restaurant was totally empty!!!!!

The food: don't understand me wrong. I had no high expectations... I just wanted some eggs and a OJ. Eggs greasy and OJ is OJ open the box and put on a cup."}
{"text":"Good pizza and very nice service here. I like too come here for eat Pizza and watching game. Before I came to town square but I think here bester."}
{"text":"Dined in a rush & had an excellent experience.  From the minute we walked up, we asked the hostess if it would be possible to get in and out in under 45 minutes.  She didn't hesitate to assure us it was possible.  We sat down & were promptly greeted by our waiter.  We expressed to him that we were in a hurry, to which he replied, \"No problem\".  He took our drink & food order simultaneously and our food was delivered in an expedited manner.  Our food was fresh, delicious, & quick.  Everyone's order was correct, our waiter continued to refill our drinks throughout the meal, and, knowing we were in a hurry, he brought the check out as soon as he confirmed everything was satisfactory.  We were in and out in under 45 minutes.  He was even patient with our girls as they made a mess playing with their drinks!  Thank you, CPK.  We will be returning."}
{"text":"Was on a layover and craving pizza - California Pizza Kitchen was perfect! They've gotten the cook time down to a science - \"7 minutes\"...but be careful, some other reviews reveal that this time is not always accurate. I was not in a rush, so I did not time it exactly, but it seemed to be pretty quick. I got a pizza with sausage and mushrooms, and it was yummy and huge (for a personal pizza). A little expensive, I think it was $11, but airport food always is."}
{"text":"I needed to kill a couple of hours waiting for my flight, so I had lunch and read a couple of magazines at CPK.  Service was better than I anticipated for an airport location.  Pizza was a little underdone, but otherwise, my visit was adequate.  My server refilled my drink and didn't bother me unnecessarily."}
{"text":"Good pizza, nice place, good customer 's service. Five cheese is our favor. Good price also. We recommend this place..."}
{"text":"The food was very good. However they forgot our appetizer and the drinking glass was broke.  The waiter didn't us much attention and one of the waiters said \"you guys must be hungry\" when they brought the food out. It wasn't very busy so there really was no excuse for the poor service."}
{"text":"Oh customer service, where have you gone? Certainly not here. Not overly busy and yet our \"server\" still managed to screw up our order. When we specifically point to a pasta dish in the menu and a pizza shows up instead. Then, when I make the observation that it's not the pasta dish we ordered (clearly pointed to on the menu) he blames us for ordering wrong. First trip to CPK, last trip to CPK."}
{"text":"Pure institutional crap. Use a real egg - damn.  Please put down the salt."}
{"text":"Having lunch at our favorite CPK location  Having lunch at our favorite CPK restaurant great service and great food great server Darienne our server was especially nice and helpful to us and we like her Manager Dena she is the general manager who keeps this place running fast and clean ,great vibes."}
{"text":"The whole experience of eating at CPK was positive. The hostesses were friendly, our server greeted us in a timely fashion, the food was pleasing, and it tasted great.
I really enjoyed their small appetizers. They are perfect to me because I like to try new things but in small bites."}
{"text":"OK, being a fan of NY pizza, I have to say this is a totally different experience. I love CPK, especially the garlic chicken pizza. The crust is amazing and the bread they bring to the table, I mean, I could just live on that bread and butta. :) Never had a bad experience at this place. Great service, awesome location. Perfect to do a little shopping and then recharge batteries with some carbs. Yeah baby!"}
{"text":"This is my  all time favorite pizza restaurant.  The food is so good and the servings are huge.  There is a large variety of pizza toppings - something for everyone.  If you don't want the pizzas on the menu, they will custom make one for you.  The service is fantastic and the prices are very reasonable.  Also, the wedge salad is the best you will find any place and it is only $4.50.  Great for kids - my granddaughters insist on going here when they come to visit.  I highly recommend California Pizza Kitchen."}
{"text":"If you've eaten at one CPK, you've eaten at them all. Honestly I feel that writing a review for a particular location of a popular franchise is repeating the facts stated in the other reviews (with slight variations of opinion and specific experiences). Well, now that I've already defined how this review is supposed to go.... 

The food is always good whenever I hit this place up. I've never had an issue with their service or the wait times. Their location is deep inside of the mall, so strip wanderers may never make it in this far. The establishment is nice and clean - though smaller than most CPKs that I've been to. Yadda yadda...

There's just one thing that stands out the most for me - the frosted mugs. YESSIR, THEM FROSTED MUGS AT THE BAR! Every single time I've ordered a beer, the mug is nice and frosted - the top of the head slightly frozen over. I can't find a spot in the mall that serves a beer better than this place. Of course El Segundo, Stripburger, and RA have full service bars with larger drink selection - but bam, this CPK wins my heart over with their frosted mugs."}
{"text":"very nice and fresh food
lot's of choices
i recommend
And you know what ?
They are charming :)"}
{"text":"Had a great fettuccini pasta at the CPK. They were able to accommodate my vegan dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"I am OBSESSED with the Gluten Free pizza here! It's amazing! If you're gluten free, you must try it! :) CPK is great at accommodating this allergy. My family who is my gluten free also loves the pizza. It's thin crust so it's nice a crunchy and has a little bit of a spice in the pepperoni. Love. Love. Love."}
{"text":"Service: we were seated right away and served quickly.  

Food:  I ordered the asparagus/arugula salad, and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"LIke all other reviews I can say I have an imaginary girlfriend or boyfriend and what they ordered and how I held their hand, but I was here on a biz trip with my mom, yes MOM and proud of it. (Real too)
Been to many cpk's in los angeles, but the one here, is simply amazing. Tried their new thin crust pizza, it had white onions, artichokes, salami and a delicious tomato sauce. Was best pizza I have ever eaten. Cobb salad was great too. (bacon, avocado,egg, blue cheese, cold chicken which I hate but just gave all to moms) and choice of ranch or blue cheese dressing (they always skimp ask for extra side)
Excellent service by James
Rarely a chain restaurant serves this good of food. 
Amazes me, that even on a monday night, this place/hotel/city is packed to the brim. Dont people work? Bad economy everyone is eating/drinking/gambling 24/7. 
I was here for business, just amazed looking at some of these people with infants and large underage groups, drunk trash, etc. WTF can't you do at home that you do here, and for much less?
at least 1/2 hour wait, so bypassed all the zombies and went straight to the bar. Waited 10 minutes b4 2 seats open up, full menu.
If your ass is too precious and prefer a booth, your welcome to wait."}
{"text":"The Mesa location cannot seem to get their act together! This is my third time having issues with getting my order right, getting my order on time or even getting my order at all.  I had tried to speak to the manager now twice got put on hold both times on the phone and no one ever came back, sat on the phone for five minutes this last time finally got fed up decided won't go back and decided to let everybody know not a location you want to go to if you want good service! Management really seems to be struggling! Lots of other restaurants at Dana Park I suggest you try anything else but California pizza kitchen!"}
{"text":"Pizza sits under heat lamps before serving. Premade garbage.  Worst pizza I ever had.  Absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Favorite is Thai crunch salad and chipotle chicken pizza is the best.  The Korean BBQ tacos are ok, needed a little bit more spiciness with the slaw topper. Davona our waitress was very good."}
{"text":"I am normally against chain restaurants, but I'm addicted to their Tostada Pizza and the BBQ Chicken Chop salad.  Both great options. 

Pass on the bread they bring to the table - it's pretty terrible."}
{"text":"I have eaten at CPK at other location before even though I like CPK but I got to say I didn't want to eat at another CPK in Las Vegas (it was at our hotel, Mirage too) when you have many other options which you won't get back home. It was our group of friends that called us later mentioning they were eating at the place. We later meet them there. I did not eat there, however, when we met them, they got some left over pizza and spaghetti. I tried them and they were great. Of course, since the quality of the food at CPK are consistently good. The prices are always reasonable. As for service, even though we dropped by when our friends are almost done eating, the waiter still dropped by once to check on us and refill our water. I don't know about the wait though but it was (I believe) around 10 or 11pm at night and there were no wait but a decent amount of people at the restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a CPK outside of California. The food and service was good.  Prices were set for Vegas so it's pricier than the CPKs that I have been to in Cali. There are plenty of other places to go to instead of here when in Vegas.  It just convenient when you're staying in the hotel."}
{"text":"As much as I hate to admit it, California Pizza Kitchen was the best dining experience we had during our stay.

Service was quick and all the employees were attentive to our table making sure we had everything we needed at all times.  The atmosphere was fun because it is right next to the sports betting area so all the big football games were on and everyone was cheering and excited.

As for the food - we ordered a cheesy bread appetizer and it came out quick.  It was hot and delicious. The perfect combo for my boyfriend and I because it was plain and boring for him but came with a bruschetta type side dish to make it more fancy for me.  We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza to share.  Again, it came out quick and was hot and tasted great.

Perfect place for a quick and inexpensive lunch.  We were completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Staff was great. Food was ok. Just a notch  above the frozen ones at the grocery store. Granted there the best pizza in the stores."}
{"text":"dig the cpk located on the west side of the fashion show mall. anytime i am feeling like a personal pizza or salad, they always come through. 

cpk is located just below from where i work in the mall so it is super convenient. i just order my lunch or dinner online, enter a pick-up time, and mossey on down the escalator to pick up my food.

effortless and convenient. =)"}
{"text":"CPK fell off the map for me after a few bad experiences at their Biltmore location back in the early '00's.  Well, it's back on the map!  

I came in for lunch at my moms request.  I was happy to see a more versatile menu as well as the same ol' hits like the cobb salad that my mom always orders.  I had half a brie and turkey sandwich with sliced pears and it tasted like something out of trendy downtown restaurant and not like it came off the kitchen line from a chain restaurant.  Well done CPK."}
{"text":"I love this place! The employees are awesome especially Thomas and Rafael!! Hard workers and always are so helpful and welcoming! Recommend everyone to eat at this location."}
{"text":"I freaking love CPK! I'm totally addicted to their caramelized peach salad. let me tell you about it.. warm caramelized peaches with dried cranberries and red onions on a bed of greens topped with Gorgonzola cheese in a balsamic dressing... and i always get mine with grilled shrimp. Throw that with a glass of Riesling and your set. The service is always great here too. Love this place"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. This \"restaurant\" claims to have a gluten free menu and even has a list of gluten free pizzas on their website when in fact they only have gluten free salad. My mother and I were ignored for about 10 minutes before they finally seated us. Rather than giving us our own table they sat us with two very drunk women that we did not know. My mother asked what soup they had and the waitress told her \"two soups\" and my mom asked \"what are the soups\" and the waitress pointed at another customers bowl of soup and with a very annoyed tone, said \"that\" and then walked away. It was a very unpleasant experience and we left without ordering. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Quick review - hummus app was good (great bread), Thai Chicken pizza was okay.  Great Lakes Octoberfest on tap (nice), and friendly service.  Don't know that we'll be back, but one of the better options in Legacy Village for sure."}
{"text":"Such a clean restaurant! Well staffed. Eric is the service manager. I can see why they are hiring well.
Great salads, tea, key lime pie. Easy to stay put at! Love sitting outside or at the bar."}
{"text":"Apparently a lot has changed at CPK, I haven't been in a while.

I came in for lunch today with my 3 year old son.  The first thing I looked at was the kid's menu.  Like a typical 3yr old, my son is very picky so I immediately looked for a chicken nuggets option.  They had one, but strangely it did not come with a typical order of fries, it came with broccoli.  Now, I totally understand that kids need to eat well and support their effort to give a veggie option, but there didn't even appear to be another option for a side.  My son eats pretty healthy at home, but Saturday after his t-ball game is when I take him out and let him get whatever he wants - and that should be my right as a parent.  So, knowing that if he saw broccoli on his plate he'd refuse to eat, I decided to order him a pizza instead.  He chose the honey chicken pizza since he's not a big fan of tomato sauce and told me he wanted chicken.

When the pizza came out and he refused to eat any, I got kinda pissed since eating out with him is always a struggle and I'm getting fed up.  More on this later.

For my lunch, I enjoyed the hummus appetizer... back up for a sec - I first ordered the small craving \"Mediterranean plate\" since I only wanted a little and it was described as hummus with Feta and pita bread. But then the waiter explained to me that it was really only a teaspoon of hummus.  WTH - who orders a teaspoon of hummus?... Anyway, the hummus was great as I remembered (but I swear it was a smaller portion than it used to be), as was the smashed pea soup.  My lunch was yum.  Service was fine, a B I'd say.

When we got home later, I again encouraged my son to eat some pizza and he again refused.  I thought this was weird since he hadn't eaten since breakfast and he is generally a pig.  When I tasted the pizza I almost gagged - GROSS!  And let me tell you I LOVE pizza.  I was secretly not so mad about the leftover pizza 'cause I knew I could eat it later.  But folks this was yuck.  It's described a having a blend of white and yellow cheese, but I would bet cash money that this was some imitation Velveeta processed cheese food crap.  The pizza is now in the trash and I made my son a chicken & (real) cheese quesadilla :)"}
{"text":"GREAT casual resto! We stayed at the Mirage and loved this place.

Mr. and I went to lunch here - it was very busy, but we did go at 1:45 p.m. on the first Sunday of the NFL. It's right beside the game/sports room in the Mirage, so it's a fab place to watch the game.

There were no tables available, so the hostess offered us seats at the bar, which offers the full menu too. No prob! We were trying to get fed and get out to the pool as quickly as possible!

We ordered two pizzas, a glass of champagne, and a diet coke. Service was quick and friendly. Space was a'plenty to eat at the bar. Not cramped at all. 

It was cool getting to see the kitchen in action (they do the pizzas out front, where the bar is, and the rest is cooked in the back - read hidden - kitchen) from our seats. We also had full view of the restaurant for people watching, at least six TVs playing 3-4 different sporting events, as well as the wall of the sports book next door (http://www.mirage.com/casino/race-and-sports-book.aspx).

PIZZA RATING SYSTEM GO!

Crust Texture: Thin, but not so thin that it's all crunch - still a good chewy/crisp combo.

Crust Flavor: Starchy-sweet. Not salty or tangy. Good, mild flavour.

Sauce Flavor: Nothing of note. It was there - not particularly tomatoey, not particularly herbal, not particularly sweet or salty.

Sauce Amount: On the minimal side.

Cheese Flavour: YUM! Salty and cheesy - tastes like real cheese as opposed to a lot of cheap pizza places.

Cheese Amount: Generous - very American-style heavy-handed. Next time I would ask for less, but it's not like it made it inedible - I love cheese... just a little on the overkill side of things.

Topping Quality: AWESOME! Fresh, interesting, top quality. Nice!

Topping Amount: Wonderful! Verging on perfect - heavy on the mushrooms, and they were very fresh, with a wide range of types. Well done, CPK!

Presentation: Nothing special - great big plates covered with your pizza! It looks very yummy though - nice and brown on top, bubbly cheese on the perimeter, no pooling oil or grease!

Overall Taste: Better than delivery, not as good as most authentic Italian pizzerias. Better than the other casual joints in The Mirage."}
{"text":"Our last meal in Las Vegas (waaaaaaaaaaah!) was here, the airport location of CPK, which we also did lunch at. We stayed at the Mirage, and there is a location within the casino. 

This location is a bit different. The pizzas are smaller, and much less attention is given to detail.

Our server, Denise, was very friendly and cheerful, and you've gotta love a server that deals with people from all over the world, from every time zone, no matter what time it is!

Our table for two (round, and way too small) was clean and ready when we were seated. It's a great view - floor-to-ceiling windows with a view of the tarmac. Awesome to watch all the planes arriving, moving around, etc.

They warned us that we need 40 minutes to get in & out, which was helpful. They were bang on (35 minutes) and we appreciated the gesture. We were thankful for the spent time - we needed to waste it!

We paid $50.22 for our lunch (before tip):
- 1 cosmopolitan ($10.99)
- 1 double crown royal & diet ($12.49)
- 1 chicken Caesar focaccia sandwich with potato chips ($10.99)
- 1 Margarita pizza ($11.99)

I think that's pretty good value (the food was good, not great...) for a sit-down meal at an airport. The pub we ate at in the Detroit airport was disgusting!

So: I don't think this location is very representative of the CPK brand - I think it's a scaled-down, single-serving kind of version of a better chain than it seems. That said, it's one of the better options at McCarran."}
{"text":"This was the start off to my vacation to NY. I was going to meet my man's parents for the first time and I needed a cocktail (at 8:30am...no less). We roll up to the bar and were immediately greeted by the friendly bartender. We order breakfast cocktails...down them and pay ($23 for two cocktails...about what it costs on the strip). It was good but nothing major to write home about. It was a lovely way to begin our trip."}
{"text":"The staff here is AMAZING. Polite, fast, friendly... The manager dropped off our appetizer, nice touch. Our server Tony is fantastic - he made our night. We visit Vegas a lot & we will be coming back based on customer service alone."}
{"text":"Do NOT order a drink, unless you have 20 minutes to spare...

A group of five of us dined at the Las Vegas Airport location Sunday, May 6, 2018. Our server was a sweet Filipino woman in her late 40s to 50s. Once seated, we ordered drinks and our food. Our sodas and beer came out promptly, and the two of us who ordered the same martini drink waited...and waited...and waited. We waited for AT LEAST 20 minutes before I asked our server if she knew how much longer our drinks would take. Mind you, the table we were seated at gave us a full and complete view of the bar and the male bartender working there. During this time, I could see plenty of other people walking into the bar and being server their beverage after only waiting a few minutes (if that). After asking about our drinks, our server went immediately to the bar and asked the bartender. His response was an unwarranted, rude exchange with our server. I could see him yelling at her and her body language quickly became defensive as she tried to explain to him that we, the customers, were only asking. This sort of behavior from one employee to another, let alone in complete view of all the patrons within the restaurant, was completely unprofessional and unacceptable. Having worked in a restaurant previously, as well as managing staff, the bartender's actions towards our server were totally uncalled for. I promptly went up to the bartender, asked what the hold up was for our drinks and received a response of \"I can't help how busy the bar is\". To which I responded, \"No, you can't but you CAN control when your drinks are served. We've been waiting 20 minutes for our drinks and other people who have walked right in already have theirs.\" No apology, no sense of urgency, just an uncalled for, rude response to a customer who ordered two of the same exact drinks and has been waiting for at least 20 minutes, while watching other patrons receive their beer almost immediately. I went back to our seat, still waiting for him to start our drinks (it took him still another few minutes until he started shaking them). Our food came out, which included two pizzas, two sandwiches and a salad. Our drinks? Still not served. Once they finally came out, our server was so apologetic to us. We assured her that it was not at all her fault. I asked to speak to a manager who came out. I explained the situation to her, and we received an emotionless, stock response of \"Thank you for brining this to my attention.\" 
I realize CPK does not manage this location, however this experience makes me, along with my four friends, no longer want to frequent CPK. Ever again."}
{"text":"After doing some serious shopping around the mall,  we decided to eat someplace that wasn't part of the food court.  The CPK where we usually dine at is in Los Angeles and we can pretty much expect the same consistent taste to our usual order.  However,  this CPK was a huge disappointment!  Everything from the pizza to the pasta and appetizers were all horrible.  The Kung pao spaghetti lacked sauce and the flavor was very VERY off.  The pizza was dry and very salty.  The spinach dip was oily and the mac n cheese was plain boring.  The food served here was the worst experience we've had at cpk. Will never come back to this location.   Waste of money and no one was happy with their meal.  Who ever is in charge of the kitchen doesn't know the true recipe and how to properly prepare these dishes.  Very stunned after tonight's dinner."}

Theme: Modern Pizza Kitchen

Overall: 4.5!

Breakdown: So we were seated fast. I had a sangria drink that was okay, nothing too special. This place is a modern pizza kitchen and the menu is decent. They offer plates that are not pizza related. The choices for apps could be better. I ordered the buffalo cauliflower app, a mushroom, pep, and sausage pizza, and the garlic chicken and seasonal veggies. ALL GOOD!! As far as the cauliflower, I make better at home, but I like theirs because it was lighter served on top on blue cheese and green onion!! Their pizza crust is light.. I love the freshly sliced ingredients. Much better than Pizza chains! The Garlic chicken was GREAT!! It is high in cals and sodium, so watch that. I love that the same effort is put into anything you order. I had plenty food to take home and share with my sister who loved it all as well! I was served by an older gentleman who was very nice.

Final Thoughts: I have never had a bad plate from this kitchen. It's a mod pizza kitchen and it stands on its own. They do offer take out/pick up! Next time you want to go out for pizza, give them a try. The Pizzas are a little bigger than personal sizes, but they are thinner!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Had potato soup and spinach dip.  My friend had a pizza. All was delicious.  The menu on line says they have gluten free options but an asterisk on the menu says they do not have gluten free at this location.   That was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Came here after a long day working the convention center and we were treated like family. Food was delicious but more importantly we were made to feel like family ."}
{"text":"I've visited many CPK's throughout California and Hawaii and since it's a franchise type of restaurant, I wasn't thinking of reviewing it. However, due to the great service we received at the Vegas location, I decided to do a quick review.
We arrived about 20 minutes to closing and we were in a bit of a bind because we just walking around the strip and we were hungry. We were tired of buffet type food and wanted to get pizza and salad. We were afraid that we would be told that the restaurant would be closing soon and that only part of the menu would be available. Quite the opposite! We were given top level service. Our waitress was very good and was always around when we needed something.

As for the food, we had the Thai chicken pizza and the Chicken Caesar salad. My friends had pepperoni and cheese. The food was as good as it is at any of the other CPK's.

Good food, excellent service had us very satisfied with our experience there. Best of all, the restrooms were very clean! (That's hard to come by nowadays).
5 stars for the food, service, and the cleanliness of the restrooms. Good job CPK Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was our second time going to this location, only because the first time we had so many issues that one of the managers gave us a free small meal coupon and did everything in his power to get us to come back again, including giving us a few cookies on our way out. Honestly if it wasn't for him swinging by our table we would have never returned to this location again. But good thing we did come back, we went during a weekday and the place was pretty slow but yet our server was still on top of things, even though he was playing bartender as well, we started off with a mushroom flatbread which was pretty tasty. Then for our main course I got their chicken tequila fettuccine and my boyfriend got one of their pizzas. I thought my pasta was pretty delicious and the server told my boyfriend his pizza would change his life lol but my boyfriend thought it was pretty good but not life changing. I am sure we will be back again."}
{"text":"after landing and waiting for a friend to land we decided on this place just because we've never had it before. it was okay? LOL. seated right away and ordered, talked with our waiter about our trip and what he suggested on doing. we didnt take any of them lol. he was nice i suppose.

i had the pasta, it has a star next to it, it didnt need a star LOL.

my friend had the chicken salad sandwich, it looked way better than my pasta, and it prob tasted better. and it had no stars next to its name on the menu. sooooo maybe they need to re prioritize that."}
{"text":"This place by far has the best customer service from hostess, waiter and manager. I had told the waiter how good my pasta was, but the only bad thing it had a peanut it. Not expecting him to tell the manager he did and she gave me my pasta free of charge. I was so impressed I have the waiter the cost of the pasta as a tip. Fashion show mall cpk rocks"}
{"text":"It is A-OK for what it is.
They have some small plate specials that we tried: white corn & guacamole dip, an arugula and asparagus salad, and a wedge. 
The white corn dip had virtually no white corn, mostly guac. While the guac was nice, I'd have preferred more corn.
The mini wedge was not mini, it was a nice size....shocked!
The asparagus and arugula salad was OK....nothing to write home about.
The main dish that we shared was pork tacos. I  know, I know......CPK.....and we ordered pork tacos....they weren't bad. (We had pizza the night before, and I had a GC to use, soooooooo, that's why we ended up here).
Service was decent, prices were OK (especially for Fashion Show mall), and food was OK."}
{"text":"I am a fan of CPK and I should totally know better than to try one in an airport BUT, we had time before the flight and this was the best of the options. 
We ordered the hummus and a salad. The hummus was not good as all. Not runny, but not thick and creamy the way hummus should be. And it had a weird taste. A spice that I've never tasted in hummus before.  I didn't care for the flat bread that came with it AT ALL. It was tough and tasteless.
The salad was eh. Cranberries and nuts and gorgonzola cheese yet it didn't have much flavor. How is that?
The service was decent considering.
I have a CPK gift certificate but they dont let you use it at the airport, WTF?
I wont be returning, it's just not good."}
{"text":"Overall I had a very good experience here at CPK.  The pizza was tasty, and my son's alfredo pasta was delicious.  Service was pretty good, a bit slow at first though.  Only downside is that it is a bit pricey for just a 12 inch pizza, $13.49 for a pepperoni, but I guess that is to be expected there.  The restaurant was very nice inside, I'll be going again very soon."}
{"text":"I ate at this location the last weekend in May.  It was okay.  I enjoyed the Easton location better."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on 10-28-2017 en route back to Virginia.  I like CPK and was hoping for the same quality of food as I get back home.  I ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza and iced tea (with Splenda).  The place was pretty busy and there seemed to be only one server.  My expectations were immediately lowered.  My server was Kimberly.  She was polite.  It took a minute or two before she came to my table, which wasn't the worst thing since I was just trying to relax.  My pizza soon came out.  It was pizza, but it was lite on the toppings.  More sauce than pepperoni and sausage.  It was eatable.  I've learned not to send food back.  :)  She kept my drink replenished pretty good.  All I can say is \"this definitely was the airport.\"  I might try it again the next time that I'm in Las Vegas, but it's not a \"must\" stopping place."}
{"text":"Ok, I am one to steer clear from chained restaurant...but hear me out.

Twas a Friday and although I brought a delicious paleo lunch (salmon and veggies) with me to work, I decided to eat out with my co-workers, and that it was going to be my cheat meal.  We decided on CPK.  

I started with the mango lemonade.  It said freshly squeezed on the menu, but I was very skeptical about that. It sure was yummy though.  Upon closer inspection of my glass, I noticed the pulp.  Maybe it was freshly squeezed somehow...I had two glasses total. 

For my entree, I chose the chicken avocado eggrolls  There were a total of six halves, and they came with a ranch and the chipotle ranch sauce.  Both were creamy and delicious with these eggrolls.  They were very filling.  After two halves, i was satisfied.

I also ordered a butter cake to go.  This butter cake taste like BUTTA!  As if it came right out of the Paula Deen's recipe book!  Oh so delicious.  

I don't mind to go out for a drink here at CPK because I can keep ordering the yummy mango lemonade (free refills)..."}
{"text":"I like coming here when in Vegas.
Was here the other night and ordered a half size morrocan something salad (it's pretty huge - get a full size if intending to share).  Good value by vegas standards - I don't feel like the price is higher than in othe cities or states.

My table mates had a cobb salad, the jerk chicken pizza and some meat pizza.  Across the way, some fab people recommended the pear and gorgonzola.

I don't think you can go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"This CPK is located within the Mirage. We went up to the hostess stand and stood there for five minutes because the hostess was nowhere to be found. Eventually we were seated, and our waitress took our drink orders. Unfortunately, they don't carry lemons for your water/soda. The spinach artichoke dip came quickly and was delicious. We were also given some Italian bread and olive oil for dipping. For entrees, my partner and I ordered  shrimp scampi entrees, which were just ok. I did not think they were flavorful enough. However, the dishes did come with a generous amount of shrimp. We were not offered dessert at the end. The whole reason we came to CPK for dinner was because my boyfriend's mother gave us two $25 gift cards to this restaurant to celebrate our trip to Vegas. Lo and behold, our waitress told us that the parent company of Mirage does not allow people to use CPK gift cards at that location, and this is clearly stated on the back of the card. She did advise that the other location in Caesar's does accept gift cards. We would not come back to this location the next time we are out here."}
{"text":"MmmmmmmmmMMMMMMMMM. Of all the things to get at a pizza kitchen, I'm telling you--try the split pea soup with barley. EGADS. That's a tasty bowl o' soup. I love their lunch specials you can get--soup/salad with pizza type things. The service was quick and friendly here, too. Brace yourself for the typical Vegas-style overpricing, though."}
{"text":"Meh there's nothing in D concourse with mentioning.  This unfortunately is the best restaurant in This concourse.  I come for salad n drinks.  The drinks take it from 2.5 star to 3.  If you're in a rush they may say you'll be fine and they have friendly servers but if you only have 30 min you may consider other options if they're busy.  They're nice people but not staffed for crunch time.

My chicken raisin salad was rest n good.  Save time given them hot card when you order to get in and out."}
{"text":"Waiter Carlos was great. He was on top of his game.  The white pizza was great. The garlic taste was perfect.  I never had to wait for my drink to be filled. They even gave my nephew a free sundae for his birthday."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful service experience and the food was absolutely incredible! We would recommend the carne Asada pizza and the butter cake to finish! If you go, please request Baruk as your server, he was so congenial and was very attentive to our dining needs. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"We were hungry and so quick bites of pizzas satisfied us before our flight. 

We got the pepperoni and margherita pizzas and both were yummy. It was the busiest place at this airport but we were seated quickly. The lady server was kind and fast, offered water frequently. 

We have enjoyed our short time while watching the Clippers game."}
{"text":"I was in the airport waiting for my flight and as a long time fan of cpk, I decided to grab a bite to eat. I ordered the mushroom and spinach pizza and it was about $16 before tax and tip. The pizza was really good. I would highly recommend you give it a try. Keep in mind it is a full pizza with 6 slices or so and they are roughly medium size cuts. They do not have pizza by the slice. It only took about 13 min for it to come out of the oven which was great because i had to get to my flight. I took away a star because the helpfulness of the staff is not there at all. When I asked the bartender for ice water he seemed put off and irritated; his bar wasn't even close to full. The host was nice but easily distracted."}
{"text":"After my last meal at the Charlotte airport, I decided to stick to something I knew and went to California Pizza Kitchen. I hardly eat at chain restaurants at home, but it seems this trip was all of that. 

Truth be told, I really came here, because it has a bar attached and they were playing the final playoff game before the World Series and being a Giants fan, that was my priority. 

I had a seat facing the TV, ordered a nice local lager on tap and a Margarita pizza from CPK next door. My beer was fabulous and the pizza was pretty good. I liked how the dough bubbled up and was light and airy. 

Even though my review should be about the bar next door, this is what I ate and it was definately a lot better than my last meal here."}
{"text":"Quick service for lunch. Had shrimp, zucchini fettuccine with Alfredo sauce, noodles seemed old and stale, not enough sauce, greasy, could have been much better. It was first option for lunch upon arrival with no line. Should have explored other options."}
{"text":"Wow this place in Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport is in need of a good review. Here goes. In the summer of 2011 I was looking for breakfast before my flight back to RDU. Maybe they should do breakfast instead of pizza because my Denver omelet (minus the onions) hit the spot for sure. The extra side of sausage didn't hurt a bit either! This was 10 in the morning so not the busiest time of the day for a pizza joint but Luis was very sure I was satisfied. I made sure his manager knew it."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here twice during our Christmas vacation. You can always count on CPK for reliable good food. It's not gourmet but it's the same at every location, more or less. On both occasions we had really good service even though they were busy. 

There was a variety of items that we tried from soups to salads to pasta and pizza. Everything was really good. It's nice that they are able to get people seated quickly and you don't have to wait forever. One night we were going to go to The Pantry and the line was long and there was no hostess to give any information so we ended up back at CPK.

I tried the peach lemonade for the first time and I have to say...I'm hooked. Give it a try, it's delicious. We'll be back here again on our next vacation."}
{"text":"Stopped for a fast lunch yesterday, yuuuk!  Sat a a fold down type table, had to got the the restroom to get wet paper towels to bring back to table and scrub down the table. ( BTW  THE bathroom was discussing!). A TURN OFF RIGHT FROM THE START,  let me just say that I've been to CPK  multiple times and have always enjoyed. My husband ordered the thin crust artichoke pizza, delicious!  I ordered the crunchy vegetable salad with peanut dressing, really bad! The whole salad was old even the \"so called crispies on top were soggy. Maybe they were just having a bad food day but there is no excuse for filth!"}
{"text":"Growing up, I wasn't a fan of CPK. But over the year, I've started to like it more! Their pasta selections are great and their pizzas are delicious as usual. The waitress is meh."}
{"text":"I only had a slice of pizza. It was good. I dunno. Ummm....I don't think it should be hard for pizza to stand out...but it is for some reason.

If you're hungry and in Vegas and at the mall (this one) and you like pizza, I see nothing wrong with running through here and grabbing a personal pie.

Unless you're on a diet.

And if you are, you shouldn't even be reading this.

Shame on you.

Go gamble your mortgage away."}
{"text":"We went here twice before going to a show.  Service was attentive and polite, I had a margarita pizza and my travel companion had a lovely salad."}
{"text":"So far one of the best pizza Joints I've been to in Ohio. I first thought I was just going in to order pizza. Nope not the case the scenery was beautiful and so clean. They asked table for 4. I was stunned lol. Then I got a pizza with sausage and pineapples and olives. It came out quickly. The waiter was super friendly and awesome. Me and my girl both had a great time"}
{"text":"It's fast, easy, and relieves that travel hunger I usually have.  And besides, this was the first taste of AMERICAN food I tasted after spending 8 months in Afghanistan (Camp Lejeune chow hall slop doesn't count) and it was glorious.  I tried one of the breakfast paninis and it really hit the spot.  Plus, they offer a military discount and the guy seemed to know it even if I wasn't wearing uniform!"}
{"text":"Typical CPK.  We like CPK pizzas especially with the whole wheat crust.  But it is a bit pricey for what you get.  This one did not disappoint on the food.  We were expecting it to be pricier than it was because of the location. (so hard to find a good, cheap meal on the strip proper), but it wasn't bad.  Still more money than we wanted to spend, but the Greek pizza was really delicious and made our tummies happy. Service was just fine."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came on a Thursday afternoon and it was not too busy. We were seated right away and greeted by our awesome server.

We decided to go for the Valentines special which was one appetizer, two entrees and one dessert choice for $32 instead of two lunch specials. It was tasty but was as I felt too much food for two. We ended up taking most of the salad home since it was brought out same time as our pizza. 

Good food, great service, would def come back again. :)"}
{"text":"I really should have done some research before coming here. *Sigh* Normally CPK is really good but you might want to pass on this airport location. The pizza lacks flavor and they skimp on the toppings. $12 for a personal pizza is too much, especially if they are skimping on all of the toppings!!!!"}
{"text":"They have a good half and half lunch selection. Your choice of half pizza and salad or sandwich and soup"}
{"text":"For a CPK the food is somewhat basic and 'quick', but it is an airport location where speed is required.
The staff are direct, to the point, and professional.  Taking orders and calling numbers from behind the counter constantly.
The location is somewhat dirty, had to clean a table myself to have a place to sit.
The food ... 
The pizza are all flat, personal size, pizzas - I am sure this was a decision based on being airport and the speed factor of cooking.  The selections are about what you find on a regular CPK menu, the flavor is also about the same.

I look forward to return."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible food and server. I ordered a wedge salad and asked the waitress if it could be chopped, she said \"no, it can't be\". First place I've ever been to that said they couldn't chop my salad. Pizza was gross, cold and the chicken tasted like it was out of a can. The waitress sucked the entire time and never refilled our water or checked on us once but did give a huge smile and asked how our meal was when she gave us to check. Nice try. Will not return."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Veggie pizza was so-so, staff worked like the non-funny version of The Three Stooges (insert your favorite stooge sound effect here). Waited 30 min for the check, after asking three times. Manager kept pulling her cell out of her cleavage and checking it. Wait staff cursing. They couldn't handle the flow so they closed up (as in closed the security gate) with patrons inside. It was cray..."}
{"text":"Where to start, the drinks aren't very good and poorly made. The server barely speaks English, so you can't understand anything he says or communicate clearly with him about what you want. If you ask to modify a lunch order, they will not help you whatsoever. Even if all you're asking for is no mushrooms on a pizza, they \"don't make any substitutions on lunch items\". Really?! Just don't put the mushrooms on the pizza, I'm not asking for them to be substituted with something else. I will never come back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Very convenient spot for lunch as it's located on the bottom level of the FashionShow Mall and can accommodate a large occupancy so we never wait to be seated during the lunch hour. I have found that the wait time for our food after ordering is taking longer and longer. They do offer a lunch special menu that has a \"pick two\" half sandwich, salad, soup or personal pizza but again you're committing for a 45 minute or more lunch unless you dine at the bar."}
{"text":"I always enjoy CPK.  Consistently good food, big menu, several vegetarian options, decent Margaritas, good service.  For a chain it's all good."}
{"text":"Located in the Mirage

+1 must have: mixed vegetable salad
+1 garlic chicken pizza AMAZING
+1 view of horse races and keno
+1 fast service
+1 great place to share food and drink."}
{"text":"Food is great, but not really pleased with the service. Makes me sad because I've worked for a CPK for over 9 years now and I'll always come back because of its unique and innovative dishes. Forreals though, the food tastes exactly the same as my own restaurant and gives me the comfort of familiarity while I'm away partying, which is why I even came to eat at a CPK in VEGAS. Service definitely could've been better. The hosts sat my friends and I at a table where it took about five-ish minutes before our server came by to greet us. She informed us that waters were already on its way to us (which was brought to us by a different staff member), didn't make any suggestions from the menu-which is fine, I already knew it like the back of my hand. Server said they'd give us some time and she would return shortly. She took about another 10 minutes to return and we ordered. We didn't get the complimentary bread-I didn't want any but my friends did. Tables that sat around us after got much faster service from our same server with their drinks and bread. Our appetizer Spinach Dip arrived at a timely manner as well as our Waldorf Salad and Spicy Chipotle Pizza. These items were dropped off by another wait staff and they did not ask if we needed anything such as black pepper (for the salad) or parmesan cheese or red chili flakes; we didn't see our server until we were more than half way done with our meal. We finished everything and did not want dessert. We asked for our bill and it took some time for her to bring it to us. 

I'll just say that if you're coming for the food and you're already familiar with it, then come! Just don't expect much from the servers, they aren't very engaging and you might not be properly set up to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"This fast food chain (yes, I called it fast food) is just another embarrassment of American culinary mediocrity. Not clean, lazy staff, and sloppy pizza."}
{"text":"Service was ok, food was horrible and there are no kid menus. The chicken picatta tasted microwaved. The artichokes tasted like they were frozen."}
{"text":"So good!  Love the variety of salads. Still the same as when I opened this great property \"Mirage\" in November 1989. It was great seeing so many old colleagues....  And thank you for the surprise treat for our complimentary meal. Everyone was great. Hugs to all and kisses too!!!!"}
{"text":"The menu here is a mini menu. It doesn't have everything other CPK's offer. It actually doesn't have much option at all. On top of the menu it said something along the lines of \"ALL INGREDIENTS ARE NOT LISTED PLEASE ASK US TO HELP YOU TO DECIDE!\" 

I asked the waitress whose name was VALERIE what is closest to the Chicken Jambalaya I usually order? She was really rude about it and said I have to order from the menu. I can understand that they don't do special orders but there's a nice way of saying it. 

After our food was brought to us no one came to check on us even once. I had to chase her down to get the bill and than chase her down with my credit card to pay the bill. It was a very unpleasant experience!!!"}
{"text":"My family used to enjoy California Pizza Kitchen a great deal. After our last visit, I'm afraid that has changed. 

They seem to have changed their recipes for pizzas several times over the past few years, and not for the better. The crust, in particular, is just not very good. They also skimp on cheese and toppings. 

I noticed that some reviews for this location state that customers received excellent service. This has not been the case for us at all the last few times. The servers we've had are not rude, just completely lacking in customer service. Your drinks sit empty on the table for long stretches of time, and it feels like you're always having to hunt your server down for anything and everything you need. Items you request are sometimes forgotten. I see this as poor 
management and training. 

Since the menu items here are on the expensive side and do not match the price point in taste and quality, I don't see us coming back."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for Las Vegas terrible service. The food was just Ok, you can get so much better in Vegas."}
{"text":"excellent shrimp pizza.  Also the roasted veggie salad was very good!  For starters the buffalo cauliflower was also great"}
{"text":"Mediocre food-unlike other CPKs.  The pizza was soggy and topping sour-also cold.  The replacement signature chopped barbecue chicken salad had virtually no goodies and almost exclusively lettuce.  It will be a long time before I return."}
{"text":"First time eating here, dropped in for a bite with a friend during some holiday shopping. The food here is great and definitely beats and food court offerings at the Fashion Show.

My friend and I shared the Carne Asada pizza which is great and is served with condiments normally served with tacos and other Mexican dishes. The bar here is surprisingly good as well, I would recommend their mojito."}
{"text":"Not exactly the best CPK experiences I've ever experienced.  Yet, I still continue to eat here whenever I visit the Fashion Show.  It's tradition with the family, I guess.

Food is mediocre, like every other CPK.  Waiters and waitresses tend to be a bit slow attending to diner's needs.  I always enjoy the strange customers that visit every once in awhile - like these two middle-aged women who both resembled Dolly Parton popping pills like crazy after eating their meal.

If you can, try to get a table on the \"outside\", so you can people watch all the passer-bys in the mall!"}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place.  I on the other hand..would love to love it...but can't.  It doesn't help that this is a new location with a full staff still in training. The service was slow and inept, the food was mediocre even by California Pizza Kitchen standards.  

One thing that I do have to admit is that I have never been a huge fan of \"novelty\" pizzas.  I view Thai chicken pizza, buffalo chicken pizza as just that...novelties.  I put it in the same category as a \"pizza\" burger.  If I want Thai chicken...I'll go to a Thai restaurant. 

There used to be a pizza here that I liked.  It had pepperoni, fresh mozzarella and capers on it.  It's not there anymore. I wonder if there was no room on the menu for it and the Cajun pizza. Sigh. My daughter and I each had a focaccia sandwiches.  I had the caesar salad, she the vegetarian.  Mine was non-descript, hers was actually quite good.  It had portabello shrooms along with red and yellow bell peppers.  If I am ever forced to go there again, maybe I'll order it."}
{"text":"We ate here on our first night in Las Vegas and came back the next night because it was so good! Our waiter was great and the food was even better. I personally would recommend the egg rolls which are to die for. It is listed as an appetizer but I got it as an entree. I already want to go back to Vegas and eat here again. (We don't have CPK in the south )"}
{"text":"Do not go to this location. The service was terrible! They were super busy so even with a phone order I order 1 hour ago I still had to wait another 1/2 and they burned our pizza. The food is not cpk quality."}
{"text":"Although this is airport food, it was Not that great.  The menu is super generic and pizza is way too much crust and very basic ingredients.  Would expect more from a place that specializes in pizza."}
{"text":"Great service and my huge BBQ chicken pizza was amazing. I ate all of it. The bartender AJ is so nice and attentive. Everyone else I encountered were supper friendly, including an employee who was off that came in to order lunch. Him and I chatted it up while he was waiting on his food. I wish I could take this CPK back home to LA with me!"}
{"text":"Had a awful service. Got food before waiter would bring us silverware. When asked he got us Napkin and Fork. 
Had to ask for knife and brought us only 2 when we were 7 people."}
{"text":"I was disappointed to find out this location doesn't bring bring bread out first like other locations. I ordered the bbq chicken pizza which I usually order at other locations and for $15 (for a personal pizza) I was not the least bit impressed. Service was also slow. Wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"This was my second time at California Pizza in LV Mirage. My first time was as disappointing as the second time. I only when the second time because my friend insisted on having pizza. The pizza is just not good overall., maybe I am a bit more demanding when it comes to pizza than others but this pizza really did not qualify as good pizza in my books. Not to mention your bill for two pizzas and a soda will run you over $40."}
{"text":"This is the second day in a row I've ordered curb side pick up from them. The woman who took the order was rude for no reason, and due to her apathy my order had a lot of things wrong with it. Cauliflower crust on pizzas that were not supposed to have it, my California Club Pizza came also on the wrong crust and they forgot to provide me the lettuce/mayo mix. This place needs their management team to be retrained both on the preparation of their food and the way their service staff treats customers."}
{"text":"Pizza and service were good service, didn't care much for the appetizer and salad menu. Might go back for pizza only."}
{"text":"RUDE. We asked for gluten free crust and the waitress was super rude about saying \"no\". I understand you may not have it but the way she said \"we don't have it\" (direct quote) was disrespectful and straight rude."}
{"text":"Terrible. Horrible management. Dirty. Menus were old and dirty. Had garbage left inside them when handed to us. Food horrendous. I had the pea soup and it's consistency was inedible. The chicken dumplings are made by an outside vender. Wife's Caesar salad was good. Service ok.  All in all, the food is way below this chain's reputation.  Add to it the dirty worn out menus and you know there is  terrible management behind it all."}
{"text":"Le matin du retour pour Vegas, je cherchais un endroit pour déjeuner. Ce restaurant de pizza servait le demeurer. Dès pizza déjeuner. J'ai bien aimé mais le Cafe n'étais pas assez fort pour moi. Trop dispendieux pour ce que c'était. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Ill give it three stars for warm, edible food and a place to sit down.  The pizzas are highly forgettable but mostly edible and not overly expensive.  The service is lousy and everything is a bit dated, but its better than Pizza Hut or Sbarros!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by for breakfast.  My son and his girlfriend ended up in the same concourse and joined us.  The staff happily rearranged tables and we had a nice window side view.   We ordered omelettes and breakfast pizzas without meat.  Substituted fruit for potatoes.   Food was good. Only complaint was that there was only a single toast slice but it was a relatively thick slice - so not that big a deal.   The highlight of our visit was our interaction with our server Guillermo.  He was there just the right amount - taking care of without bothering us.  Joking with us.   Even got our last set of refills to go.   I'd be happy to go back next time in LAS."}
{"text":"California Pizza Kitchen's are everywhere....usually inside malls but this location  is easy in, easy out, which is why I enjoy coming here.  This location is not crazy busy where you have to wait 30+ minutes.  I always remember this location so if I am in the area I try to make a stop for a quick lunch.  

The service is always excellent...great hostess and our waiter was absolutely attentive.  I already know the food......I come for the salads and pizza's, plus I always bring my son and he loves the kids menu selection.   I love how this location is different for some reason because it's never too crowded that I have to wait, but the staff has always been super accommodating, always friendly and if you frequent CPK you know the food will be delicious.

Enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Had an early dinner last night and I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It isn't your typical pizza joint. 

The salad I ordered was delicous. I really enjoyed the fresh apples and candied walnuts. Plus the dressing was fantastic. I believe it was called the waldorf! 

My husband ordered a pizza that was spicy and sweet. I had a piece that was cold later that evening and it was great! The crust was nice and thin. Our server was Sam. He was pretty awesome!

It wasn't crazy busy anx the restaurant was clean and the drinks were fresh. 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"In town visiting and meeting family for a quick bite while shopping....sat at the bar and received excellent service from Marquese at the bar...if you are in town definitely ask for Marquese!"}
{"text":"Always delicious with great attentive service.

Located in the Mirage casino right by the race and sports book. You can watch the big screens as you eat if you would like.

It's open air seating, so it can get a bit loud if it's busy in the casino.

I love the Thai chicken pizza. I always love Hawaiian. You can get half and half for 3$ extra. 

They also have delicious pasta as well,  if your looking for something other then pizza."}
{"text":"My $50 gift card wasn't good enough. They don't accept gift cards. What??? So we left. The waiter told us there is another cpk in the mall. Our money was not good enough. So I can't even review the food. Pssstt."}
{"text":"It didn't look like much but it was better than it looked. My veggie pizza without cheese. Broccoli was delicious. Mushrooms were good. Needed little more sauce. It was little on the dry side. Probably because I had no cheese. My waiter brought my drinks before my other one finished. Top service. What I wanted was salad pizza but I just don't know how to order it. I just have to try it again. Ha!"}
{"text":"Much better service here than at the pretentious wine bar in the main terminal. As soon as I got settled Rene was right there to take my order. Super friendly service from him. Great job. The major drawback about this place is that they don't have unsweetened ice tea. Major disappointment from the good service I was getting."}
{"text":"As stated in a previous review for another chain in Vegas, I like supporting local restaurants. However, I'm vegan, so my food options were somewhat limited while visiting Las Vegas.

It was a nice surprise when I asked about vegan menu options, the hostess at CPK pulled out a LIST of items appropriate for me! That has never happened to me at a chain restaurant before! (\"Vegan? I don't know what that is.\")

The pizza I got was really good, the service was good, but there is a price mark-up here...about $2 more than regular CPK's. Other than that, no complaints!"}
{"text":"Gate guru gives it good reviews, but my pizza was gross. Crust too thick, way too much cheese.  There is one plug on the wall that separates the CPK from the bar next door.  Very spendy at $16 for a personal pizza and small Fiji water."}
{"text":"Every time I've eat at this location, I've had excellent service and the food has been REALLY great! It seems that they are really uping their game with new menu items and delicious hand-crafted cocktails. It's also a great place to bring my toddler - their mac 'n cheese is awesome!

Most recently, Justin was our server for the evening. He provided amazing service, had many suggestions for food and drink and an even better attitude. We also always get a table stop by from the manager - a nice touch. 

Well continue to go here, especially when we get treated as well as we did with Justin."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for pizza so of course I had to come here! They never disappoint. They are not the vest for pizza in my opinion but are always good especially for the kids! The ranch is super yummy. Love there Sicilian pizza. Love that they have gluten options for crust. They have yummy alcohol drinks. Their strawberry lemonade is delicious. Prices are good and service is always good!!"}
{"text":"Ate at California Pizza Kitchen at the Las Vegas airport. Surprised that this establishment has such a low rating on Yelp because we had a very pleasant experience here. My margarita was good, better even than some bars we've been to. I had a Hawaiian pizza. Very good! Nice, crispy crust. Plenty of ham and pineapple. I wouldn't mind eating here again."}
{"text":"I was at this CPK a few weeks back, and I had a neutral experience.  I sat at the bar for dinner, and it was pretty obvious the server back there was overworked.  We started chatting, and I found out that he was covering for like 3 different people.  Not going to lie... you could tell the service wasn't that good.  But I felt bad for the guy that got the shit end of the stick and had to do more work.  I see both sides of it, but as a customer, it wasn't the best experience."}
{"text":"I would strongly avoid the LAS airport CPK - even if you're a CPK fan! First off, this restaurant is not like \"normal\" CPKs. The menu is different and the food is different. I got the Hawaiian pizza and I'm pretty sure it was not only smaller but used different ingredients and/or different preparation as well. It just didn't taste the same as what I've had at CPK before.

Second, service is awful and I'm concerned about hygiene and food safety issues. My coworker avoids dairy products due to allergies so asked for one of the salads minus the mayo. The salad came out with mayo anyway, which my coworker found out after poking at the salad with her fork. When we notified the waiter, he at first acted like there wasn't mayo on it; my coworker again poked at the salad with her fork to show the waiter the mayo, and the waiter had a huge attitude about it and let out an exasperated sigh before taking the dish away.

The waiter checked something in the system and no more than 30 seconds after he'd removed the salad from our table, delivered it to another table! I couldn't believe it. It's bad enough that the restaurant would redeliver a dish that the waiter had already put out on another table, but to actually redeliver one that he had seen my friend use her fork in! My friend hadn't actually eaten any of the salad or ever put the fork in her mouth - but the waiter sure didn't know that!

I flagged down another waiter to complain to a manager, but none came before we had to leave to go catch our delayed flight. I don't know if the waiter just ignored us or the management just doesn't care. Based on my experience here though, I'd have to wager it's the latter."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most disfunctionable places I have ever eaten. Bartender was nice and seemed to try his best but literally over poured every beer to the point it overflowed the base under the tap and overflowed on to the bar and into my lap. NICE. Other man behind the bar I could only assume was the manager also could not pour a beer. Bar top was half full although they were so frantic as if the place was packed although it was not. 

Everyone seemed a bit mad at each other. Everyone at the bar top was also not very thrilled as the service and attitude of employees was terrible.

Pizza was ok. Similar to a small microwave oven pizza from the freezer. 

I would not come here again."}
{"text":"Dined here 4-16-17 after the Beatles Love show. When we arrived the were several open tables, but still a short wait. The server was ok nothing out of the ordinary, we ordered a Cesar salad to split between my wife and myself along with a pizza. The salads can out first seemed fresh. Then the pizza came out quite a bit latter. It was Luke warm and tasted as if it had sat under a warming light for quite a while. (Old tasting) We each ate one piece, and asked to box it. We latter heated it in a microwave, but could not get past the old taste. Threw it out. Total waste on money."}
{"text":"NIce palace to eat pizza and great service. Middle of the mall you can see lots of nice things around you too. :)"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to see CPK at the airport and serving breakfast.   

I had an early morning flight back to the east coastand time for breakfast so stopped in for an omelette.  The omelette and potatoes were delicious.  Totally hit the spot to get me through the long flight.  The waitress was really nice as well.  

The downside ... totally unexpected.  They have these newish Salt & Pepper shaker that is a combined salt shaker/pepper grinder.  My coworker totally drowned her egges with salt by accident.  So be careful with those especially if you are on a low sodium diet!

I can't speak for lunch or dinner service.  We had great service but it was early and not too busy.  Our server got us our checks early so we could head out when we were finished and she kept my water glass full.   I'd go here again for breakfast in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Landed in Vegas, the timezone change was wreaking havoc on my hunger level (it was 11am Vegas time, 1pm EST where I came from, and I had only had a protein bar and some munchies on the plane), so I was HUNGRY. Skipped all of the $$$ places at the Wynn and headed over to the Mirage for some CPK. This CPK has never disappointed; it's right off the casino so you can engage in some fun people watching while you're devouring your pizza or whatever else you ordered. It's not cheap (my wife's mac and cheese was $11 for a plate of rotini and cheese) but the food was good. The waitress was mechanical but efficient so no real complaints about the service. Thanks CPK!"}
{"text":"Diners be aware. This is by far the worst possible eating experience ever. Cashier is extremely impatient and rude.

Food is alright, the Thai pizza is pretty good, but the food is completely ruined by how rude the staff here are."}
{"text":"We love CPK - but I've never been to one this bad. It took 20+ minutes to get water and about 40 minutes to get food. Salad was out about 3 minutes before pizza, pizza was soggy. Service was terrible."}
{"text":"Oh this was dreadful .  Eaten in so many CPKs and I don't know how they let this one bear the name.   This review is about the service and poor attitude because we left after 20 mins without any acknowledgement from our waiter.  I did get up twice to ask 2 other waitresses who were gossiping by a service area if we could order but were told it wasn't their table and our waiter \" must be busy\".  Meanwhile only half the tables were occupied - the rest being piled high with dirty dishes - this was 10am and breakfast time by the way.  We left and got decent food and a good attitude from  Starbucks to go."}
{"text":"International menu!

We have one of these CPK's in Roseville but my first taste had to be in Las Vegas... hmm, to my delight the menu catered to many different taste buds! I thought that they only specialize in pizzas, silly me! Dined here with friends and everything was pleasant. Service was great! Fast even though the restaurant was packed by lunch time on a weekend!), location is just further south of the Strip and there is a parking garage in case side streets are full. One can compare this Las Vegas location to that of The Fountains in Roseville (less the parking garage).  I had the Carnitas Tacos (slow-roasted pork topped with housemade avocado salsa verde, red onions and cilantro)...  the meal came with two tacos, it was yummy but I could only finish one only because we had ordered the dim sum for appetizer, it's actually the Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings (Chinese dumplings topped with sesame seeds and green onions. Served with our soy-ginger chili sauce) mmmmmm!!!  The menu also came with a nutritional guide for those who are watching their calorie intake. Overall, very nice experience.

{"text":"Sehr leckere Pizza BBQ und die Suppen ein Traum.
Preis Leistung Super, kommen gerne wieder"}
{"text":"My husband and I were deciding on places to eat and he decided we should go here since we were already inside of the mall. It was pretty crowded but we only had about a 10 minute wait. So we were seated at our table and the server took a little while to get there. When she got there we ordered our food and we waited for that to come to us (which took quite some time because they were busy). After we got our food, we realized it was made incorrect. I told the waitress bring our dressing on the side, but instead she brought the food WITH the dressing on it and salsa on the side (not to mention there was no chicken on it). Soo flagged a manager and she told us to keep that one and would order another one. Well the next one came out semi-correct. It was still missing the chicken! So hour or less then tentative server decided to say that we didn't order it, which was a lie. So we had to wait, yet again for a third pizza which was different. We started to eat it, but our appetites were shot to hell by the time we realized our stupid waitress was messing everything up. Overall, we don't plan to return to this crumby location ever again. But we haven't ruled out the better location we went to previously in Town Square.  So bottom line, avoid this articulate location. You'd be better off eating Auntie Anne's or Subway instead of this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by for an early lunch at this airport location in Terminal 3 and noticed that many of their signature dishes were missing from the menu. I used to be a California Pizza Kitchen regular when I lived in Texas & am pretty familiar with the menu. Many of the regular CPK dishes like the pesto pizza weren't on this one as I learn't it's a franchise location and finally I settled for the Veggie Pizza which looked oddly familiar. When the pizza arrived it was much smaller in size (which I didn't mind), however it didn't look or taste like any of the signature CPK pizzas. I'm pretty sure this one came straight out of a box from the frozen section. The crust was tasteless and underdone and over all the texture and taste left much to be desired. The veggies were wilted and clearly not fresh. Could barely finish it. 

The service was rushed as they were understaffed and not equipped to deal with the convention crowds. There was one server working the patio section and he was running around doing his best. 

Stop by for drinks if you need a place to chill and charge your devices - wouldn't recommend a meal."}
{"text":"Surprised by the food here. I didn't really expect much! I had The Meat Cravers (thin crust pizza). Nicely toasted crust but because it's on a ceramic plate, only the edges stay crispy. A little skimpy on the toppings, but good flavors. Got there at opening time and the place filled fast. Good service and attentive server. First time to this chain. If I have a pizza craving while traveling, I'll look for this chain."}
{"text":"Jaime Dunton, Asst. General Manager, my apologies...this review is long overdue.  On Veterans day, my spirits were at an all time low.  I rarely feel this way, however, time has a way of reminding you about prior experiences while strengthening the bond you have to the people and places you've encountered during those moments.  Jaime, Rafa the server was amazing and had an impeccable eye for detail. I believe the hosts name that night was Tony (I looked at my contacts on my phone) he's about to embark on a journey that will transform him forever, HOORAH MARINE CORPS!!!  Together, all 3 you formed a team that delivered genuine customer service from the heart, not a script.
The food was amazing, the sincerity and touch of human warmth will forever remain ingrained in my heart, mind , and soul. Thank you so much for our conversations that night with ALL of you.  It makes me proud to know (as a Marine and server in the hospitality industry) that there are people out there that can still make you feel at home by simply being themselves and not reading from a \"script\".  I \"salute\" all of you (pun extremely intended).  If attitudes are contagious, I hope to never lose the amount of positivity and love that I received from your staff that night.  Keep up the good work, I don't even have to write that....from my perspective, it isn't work for your team, it's a passion!"}
{"text":"If you have never been to a CPK what are you waiting for? My fav is the Thai Chicken Pizza and I'm a huge fan of Fettucini Alfredo and Caesar Salads and I never stray from the fav's so one of these items will be on my order.  Nice place to take the kids too especially this location (Inside the Mirage) so you can combine it with the Secret Garden outing. Kids love the Pepperoni and Margherita Pizzas.  The atmosphere is loud but it's Vegas baby!"}
{"text":"When guests are in town this is an easy pleasing modern casual place for everyone. CPK is always fresh, delicious and offers a variety of appetizers, wines, entree's and salads.  

Here's a few of my hits and misses.

On this visit I tried the hummus...Skip it, it's bland and tasteless.

Grilled veggie salad good but needed more dressing.

Ceasar Salad very good.

Alfredo pasta very good for those sinful days.

Chili Relleno surprisingly good-but presentation a bit sloppy.

Nice kids menu offering pizza and pasta.  My picky eater eats the pizza here so that's always a relief.

Great attentive service.

Great selection of pizza's, my favorite is the Thai Chicken with Peanut sauce-heavenly.

Great place inside Fashion Show Mall to stop and rest your feet while enjoying some really great food."}
{"text":"I've been here before and I remember it being a better experience.  Maybe the place is just too mainstream now, more quantity than quality?  I don't know.  Maybe it's just because my taste buds have grown up in the past several years.

We went here on a Friday night, so it was packed.  We waited for probably 10 minutes for a table.  Good thing is this CPK in the Mirage is located right next to the sports book so we could at least catch the scores.  We finally got a seat and proceeded to order drinks.  Our waiter was friendly and courteous.  We got our complimentary plate of bread (what happened to a basket?  Geez.) of like 3 slices for the 2 of us with some butter.  The bread was already cold, almost as cold as the butter.  I had to schuck it aside.  Boo.

They had a few new pizzas on the menu (the Buffalo Chicken pizza stands out), but I usually stick to my fav, Original BBQ Chicken pizza on Honey Wheat dough.  But I felt different today, I wanted a change.  I couldn't decide between the Thai Chicken Pizza or the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza.  Our waiter suggested the Thai Chicken because it's on of his favorites.  I added Honey Wheat dough to it for my crust.  My fellow diner got the Tostada pizza.  This was his first time here, so the Mexican side of him (he's HAOLE (caucasian guy to you mainlanders)....HA HA) wanted to try this.  

In between waiting for our pizzas we were entertained by lots of people.  Some big, some little, some kids...all of them happy by being out it seems.  Nice to see even in our rough economy families have time to spend with each other.  There was even this ONE guy that came in to dine with 7 chicks!  No joke!  One of the girls was getting hitched I think.  He was the spectacle of the evening.

Our food finally came.  My Thai Chicken pizza looked excellent!  Fresh and bubbly from the Mozzarella cheese.  It tasted just as good too.  The marinated chicken breast went well with the peanut-ginger and sesame sauce on the pizza.  The green onions and cilantro just carried the Asian flavors.  Carrots, bean sprouts and  roasted peanuts gave the pizza some great texture and crunch.  My waiter had made a most excellent suggestion and I was pleased.  The crust was great as well, not too thick, crunchy on the crust, not doughy in the middle, and with a clean, slightly sweet taste from the honey.

My friend said his Tostada pizza was excellent as well.  He liked the grilled lime chicken and the black beans and how it complimented the sharp Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses.  The fresh lettuce and  crispy tortilla strips on the pizza were a welcome and refreshing crunch.  The pizza was supposed to come with herb ranch dressing, but it wasn't apparent on the pizza or on the side.  It was ok, my friend said it didn't need it anyway.  Overall, he was pleased on his first visit to CPK.

This place is not so bad for a quick, little bit cheaper dinner (but not by much) if you have to eat at a sit down joint on the Strip.  Average pizza price is around $12-$13 for one individual pizza.  Come on, pizza...it shouldn't be TOO expensive, even if it's gourmet! 

This place would have gotten 4 stars if my bread came HOT and in a BASKET (I know, strange) and if the prices were a little less stiff.  It might have gotten a 5 star if those 7 chicks came to sit with us instead!"}
{"text":"Got way delayed on our vacay trip to San Francisco, ended up catchin' a meal here at CPK in the McCarran Airport!

For a chain I usually don't mind CPK, it's well known so the food should be fairly consistent.  This one though, was lacking in the food department.  Perhaps the airport environment messes with the quality a bit?  I dunno.

The food overall wasn't bad, but it was definitely lackluster.  Just not the quality I was expecting for a CPK.  Not only were the portions smaller than I'm used to from them, our salad & pizzas were barely on the OK meter.  Not as fresh as they could be being that it is CPK!

We ended up having:

*California Cobb Salad - applewood smoked bacon, avocado, chicken, tomatoes, chopped egg, basil & Gorgonzola with house herb ranch dressing

*Thai Chicken Pizza - grilled chicken breast with peanut sauce topped with crisp bean sprouts, carrots & scallions

*Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza - cremini mushrooms, pepperoni, spicy Italian sausage, fresh basil, Mozzarella & Greek oregano

Did I already say the serving sizes were on the small side?  I was wondering why the pricing at this particular CPK was a smidge cheaper than a full-sized CPK restaurant.  And did I get my answer!  The salad definitely came in a smaller bowl, and our pizzas definitely looked near an inch smaller in diameter than normal for CPK.  And we were hungry!

Our California Cobb Salad was barely shareable for 3 of us.  It was OK but the lettuce just wasn't as crisp & cool as it could be.  My guess is that it sit under a heat lamp for a bit?  Was soggy in a few parts.  The bacon wasn't as crispy as I like it as well.

The pizzas were just OK too, the serving size was just not what I normally expect.  This is akin to more of a personal pan pizza size, at least in my opinion.  The toppings were sparse on our Thai Chicken Pizza as well, very little chicken and too much crust.  Crust is good, but give me more toppings please!

Not a bad lunch at McCarran's CPK, but you can for sure see its shortcomings as a restaurant.  Service was pretty good, our waiter did leave us hanging though for a while when we were looking for drink refills.  Other than that it was par for the course.

Not sure if I would eat at this CPK again, might be better options for the money.  Up your airport pizza game, CPK!"}
{"text":"I had to try this pizza place out, since it closed down where I live. *tears* :'( This was my first time trying California Pizza Kitchen! I'm glad I did. All I did was ask the host if he could put together a vegan pizza for me. And voilà! My vegan pizza was made wonderfully! An array of veggies on top! Lots of it! That's what a vegan pizza is all about! I enjoyed it very much! It wasn't salty like most pizzas I've had either! That's a plus! CPK is a vegan-friendly place. If you're vegan and crave pizza, this place is good to go to! I had a great experience! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Service was good and the food came quick. I was glad that a few places such as the CPK stayed open later (til 10 PM). Otherwise I'd be starving on the plane with no food service. 

The garlic chicken pizza was yummy and it came with 4 slices for 11.99. The asian chicken salad was a bit too salty due to the sauce however."}
{"text":"Very good, well priced and never have they messed up my order, which is rare...I'm picky and allergic to a lot! I always get the BBQ Chicken Pizza (no onions no cliantro), Tortilla Soup or Thai Salad. Those are guaranteed awesomeness. This location is great for a quick lunch while at Fashion Show Mall."}
{"text":"Quality shouldn't be sacrificed because this is an airport location.  CPK can generally be relied on for tasty food, but this location just sucks. What you'll find here is a limited menu and an unorganized waitstaff running around with its hair on fire for no real reason. You can find better food at the airport, don't let the reliability associated with the brand name fool you."}
{"text":"Seeking out a place to lunch at I happen to notice this restaurant. While I am familiar with the brand having dined at several of there other various locations I have never eaten here. So, why not? It's pizza which one cannot never go wrong with and CA Pizza Kitchen is top notch when it comes to creativity with their toppings and freshness.

We decided to eat in and with this being a touristy area we did not have to wait but the dining area was busy. The smell coming from the kitchen was intoxicating and with all the pizza odors mixed up it was heavenly smelling. The atmosphere of the restaurant is so laid back and cool too.

Decided to order off the lunch menu duos a personal type size 7 inch pepperoni pizza with the super spinach plus quinoa salad. It paired so well together and the salad was awesome so was the champagne vinaigrette dressing. The salad was filled with pecans and apples so delicious with spinach too. For an appetizer I had the Mexican Street Corn until the pizza got here. It's so good. Ultimately for dessert decided to try their Butter cake and was so happy that I did. Their Butter cake is so rich and decadent with the fluffy whip all around it so awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered a wonderful breakfast burrito, but trying to eat at this location was painful had to listen to an employee complain throughout my ENTIRE breakfast because he feels he is not treated right... Get a new job!!!! I will choose another location next time. (burrito was great)."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service from Steve. We had the margarita pizza and the works  pizza. Amazing crust.  Apps were equally great!  (Sczchwan dumplings and chorizo fundido)."}
{"text":"This place used to be better.  They have changed their menu significantly in the last year.  No more White Pizza, the portions are smaller, and the drink menu is quite limited (beer and wine, limited mixed drinks).  

Our waiter was the lone bright spot as he really tried to give great service. unfortunately, our pizzas came out before the other entrees (Salmon and flat bread came out much later ).  You are in Las Vegas, don't settle for this place - there are many better places!"}
{"text":"Can I be a fan of California Pizza Kitchen, if I have never actually tried the pizza? I thought it over, and yes, yes I can. CPK may or may not do pizza well, but they definitely can put together a delicious salad! 

I had gotten salads to go from this location a few times, but I have only eaten in one time... It was a beautiful spring day, so my lunch companion and I decided to sit on the patio. Sometimes service on patios can be spotty, I am happy to report that was not the case for us. Drinks were refilled in a timely manner, multiple members of staff stopped by to make sure we had everything we needed. 

The caramelized peach salad is what we decided to share. I love that CPK offers the option of a full or half sized salad, the full with chicken added was plenty for us two. The cranberries, Gorgonzola cheese and walnuts were perfect compliments to the delicious peaches. To drink we each had flavored lemonades. The lemonade is fresh-squeezed, the fruit flavoring comes from a syrup though. Still refreshing and yummy, but worth mentioning. 

Total damage was around $25. Not bad for a yummy and fairly healthy meal!! I will definitely be back, perhaps I will even try a pizza someday!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of menu items,food seems fresh (except for our dessert--cheesecake with an odd taste), prompt,courteous service but man, is this place expensive!!  $75.00 for lunch for 4 people is just too much and we did not order an excessive amount of food.  Will be a long time before I return(if ever)."}
{"text":"I come to this place all the time.  My favorite is peach iced tea and I always order the wild mushroom pizza and Caesar salad with grilled shrimp.  I love the location because it is surrounding by wonderful shopping (at Town Center).  What better way to end a fun shopping day with friends?  The peach tea here has the best aroma.  Its the best I've ever had.  Just recently they added new items to their menu.  I strongly recommend the Habanero Carnitas Pizza.  It has slow-roasted pulled pork, red onions, cilantro pesto, mozzarella, and queso quasadilla cheese, with spicy habenaro salsa.  Its quickly becoming my new favorite.  I suggest you be careful with the sauce its super spicy.  That's it."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was great! I had the bbq chicken salad and didnt know what to expect... But i did have fear that it would be too sweet or too bbq. Guess what i was wrong, so thumbs up. Oh yeah it was also super fast."}
{"text":"I love CPK but our experience here December 11th had to be the best ever!  My family and I went to see Santa at the Dreamwork's experience before lunch and left our pictures on the table when we left.  We called that night just to discover they were nowhere to be found.  The morning after, the daytime Manager from the day we were there (whom we met) called my husband to apologize and then proceeded to go way above by explaining the situation to \"santa\" and get new print outs of our special day.  I was in tears (literally).  I cannot express how much I appreciate her not to mention the amazing meal!  CPK I applaud you and your staff."}
{"text":"Ate here twice this week and it was very good both times! First time here was a carry out and second time we actually sat down. Service was amazing each time.... as soon as my fiance and I sat down we were offered menus silverware and glasses of water while waiting at the bar. We had the pepperoni pizza, garlic alfredo, and the avocado egg rolls. All delicious :)"}
{"text":"I am only familiar with this place because of the frozen pizza I see at my grocery store.  My husband and I decided to give this place a try since we were going to the Mirage.  The line was pretty long when we got there but only waited a few minutes because the guy who works behind the counter came out and grabbed a few people who didn't mind sitting there.  So we had our dinner at the counter next to the beer tap, the kitchen door and all the cooks.  I didn't care we were not there for the ambience.
     We both ordered a pizza with pineapple and pepperoni.  I ate half of mine and my husband ate all of his and the other half of mine.  He is a fan for sure, but frankly I like the frozen ones better.  At least if I cook it myself I know it's actually cooked.  Good service and a plus for not having to wait in a long line to eat, but the food is Meh."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Overly smokey casino. Pizza was just okay. Wait for a table. 
Other places better for the price."}
{"text":"There Valentines special they are offering this week is a great value! Lots of food, several selections all for $32.  Includes appetizer, main course, bread, and desert.  Pleasant environment, not noisy, and quick service.  Our meal was piping hot! They recently remodeled adding extra space and more openness."}
{"text":"This location is prime, situated directly in the middle of the casino. Definitely a lackluster experience, despite being a popular chain in my hometown.

I had the fettuccine alfredo with chicken, since it's always a safe bet. The alfredo sauce was bland and the chicken tasted like it was frozen - dry, chewy, and tasteless. Granted, I'm the kind of woman that prefers chicken breast meat over dark meat, but the chicken was beyond dry! I didn't have much before my stomach started acting up.

If you even have a remotely weak stomach like me, as greasy foods make my stomach churn, you know that the first jab of pain signals a LONG bathroom visit. Halfway through the meal I told my partner that I had to leave and scrammed to the nearest bathroom, which, by the way, was quite far since casino bathrooms are often at opposite ends. Three bathroom trips later, while still hugging my stomach, I am reminded of why I often stick to salads at such places.


Service-wise, seating is fast and the waitress checked on us quite often. Our water glasses were never empty."}
{"text":"It's an airport location and I never expect much from airport food, but thought maybe with a chain restaurant things might be different.   First, our little round table was so small for the two of us that I had to remove all the condiments, etc so we had room to eat.   

Their breakfast menu is small, mainly egg dishes.  I had one egg over easy, bacon, potatoes and wheat toast.  My husband has two scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes and white toast.  The food came rather quickly, but everything was barely luke warm.  The butter wouldn't melt on the toast and cold breakfast food is just kinda gross.  Should have gotten a pizza."}
{"text":"Ok food. Convenient in the casino. Service is fast casual. Prices OK.  Little choices for kids. Nice for people watching next to sports book."}
{"text":"pretty good airport food. the thia pizza is super taste."}

Children, Pizza, Koontz

This seems to be the choice hang-out for the family oriented diner of Legacy Village. Family and kid friendly, this place can get pretty boisterous and disorderly on a busy night. Bring your patience, your pills and ear plugs. 

I've been to this locale plenty of times in the past, with the most recent trip last night to meet up with my Mum.  We sat on the patio which overlooked the courtyard and Bar Louie. Alfresco dining at it's finest. In the summer, the courtyard/stage area offers movies and live music. A pretty nice amenity if you can survive without having your wallet drained by the surrounding upper class retail outlets. Last night, \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\" was playing. Needless to say, kiddy enthusiasm filled the air. 

As for the menu, it's practically endless in options. Countless pizza creations, sandwiches, soups, salads, pastas and more. The menu is like a Dean Koontz novel. No one ever finishes reading it in it's entirety because it's just too damn long. 

I opted for the Greek Pizza. For some strange reason, I've been in a Greek Rut lately. The last 4 meals I've had out to eat have all been Greek Pizza's. The last movie I saw at the theater was \"Getting Him to the Greek\" and I've been unexplainably spraying Windex on everything, hoping to somehow remedy all of my non-disabling ailments. I can't explain my psychosis. I am a very disturbed individual.  

The pizza was ok, but probably my least favorite Greek pie in the last four attempts. I do like the dough though. Probably the best part about this pie. The Cherry Limeade I had was perfectly refreshing too."}
{"text":"Love this place, today our waiter was rude, not attentive and also keep ignoring our requests for the check. He got upset when i asked for bread. Customer service is always important."}
{"text":"They are so consistent. Loved their garden veggie pizza & Pea soup for lunch combo."}
{"text":"Was just going through my review drafts & realized I never posted this one. So, this review is based on our visit on June 23rd...

My boyfriend & I had just left our friends at Hakkasan & were trying to find somewhere to eat. There wasn't a lot open late-ish on a Monday night (after EDC) in Vegas but we found this CPK! I tried calling to place our order ahead since it was about an hour from closing- I didn't want the kitchen to close before we got there. When I called someone rudely told me that I had be staying at the Mirage to order for pick-up & then hung up on me. When I got there I discovered our hotel was also covered under their to-go orders... oh well, we were already there. The hostess was extremely nice & told us we could order at the bar. It only got worse from there... the bartender completely ignored us. I tried to ask if I could order & he acted as if he didn't hear and then walked away. I had to get one of the chefs to take the order. The man working behind the bar was rude, unpleasant & by far the most negative attitude I encountered during my week in Vegas. We were sober so it's not like we were being loud, causing a commotion or asking for anything extraordinary. I can understand getting annoyed with someone causing a scene but we were just trying to find a late dinner. So, one star for good food & one star for the super awesome hostess. And minus 3 for the bartender with an attitude problem. 
PS, thanks so much to the cook for stepping up to take our order. Probably wouldn't have gotten to eat without your help!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim to get a snack before our late night dinner reservations.  The spinach artichoke dip was great.  Our wait staff was constantly coming by to fill water and see how we were doing."}
{"text":"$13+ for a turkey bacon avacado...  undercooked bacon,  reconstituted turkey bologna stuff, micro thin avacado, dry, old chibatta bread or similar.  Why can you not get a decent meal at the LAS airport?  It's not like it was free...  Iced tea was icky and cloudy.

Where are the toppings on this Pizza?  (See photo) BTW, the only reason there IS cheese on this pizza is because we paid for extra after seeing our neighbors plate of crust...

Save your money and grab a pretzel..."}
{"text":"Gotta say that for pizza and salad, it is hard to beat CPK.  We bypassed the stupid 100+ people line waiting for the Cravings Buffet at the Mirage and were first in line for the 11am opening at CPK.   Two people, two half salads and a thin crust pie was a winning combo.  Simply, solid fare and we could study the horse race lines as well.  I made my first ever horse track bet during this meal.  Damn you \"All the Figs Men\"!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect much, but  was still surprised how bad the $17 salad was. It was a bowl of iceberg lettuce,  2 oz of cold chicken, 3 pieces of wilted romain, a tiny bit of corn/beans/tomatoes and missing corn chips. It was terrible!"}
{"text":"Open really late, the food was good, the service was even better. I asked to take my drink out to the casino and she said that was totally fine, winner winner chicken dinner."}
{"text":"I absolutely love pizza. Pizza is my life! Pizza is bae. Pizza is one of Gods best creations... however this pizza was just.....okay......My cousin and I came here because we had a long layover trying to get back to Indianapolis and decided to eat at California  pizza. I have been wanting to try it considering we have a California pizza in Circle center mall in Indianapolis. I am glad I was able to try it out and it probably will be my last time unless I go there for a party or special event. The staff was nice, the salads were pretty, and the environment was chill. It was appropriate for quick airport food so I am glad it was an option. 

Pros-
Friendly staff 
Toppings flavors were good 
Crust was good 


Cons- 
Pizza seasoning could be improved. 
Expensive"}
{"text":"I have not been to CPK in about ten years. This location is amazing. Kevin was our server. He truly made our experience a great one. Thanks Kevin!

We had the Original Chopped Salad and the Thai Chicken Pizza. The flavors were great. The atmosphere was great, and the service amazing. We really felt welcomed and relaxed. 

Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Richtig gute Pizza, mal anders und interessant belegt. Wir hatten eine sehr freundliche Bedienung, aber anzumerken war, essen, zahlen und raus bitte... Zeit ist Geld. Schade, mit ein bisschen besserem Kundenservice macht es hier noch mehr Spaß. Ambiente: Casino- u. Sportsbar -like"}
{"text":"I'd like to give this CPK location 3 stars, but the service was just so awful I have to down grade to 2.   

I arrived early for a morning flight and had time to kill. There weren't a lot of food options so I settled on CPK.   After being seated, in a half empty restaurant, I probably waited 10-15 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge my presence and take my order.  Thankfully, the hostess gave me a menu or I really would have been annoyed.  

I ordered the breakfast pizza - it was decent and the size was pretty decent.  Overall I was happy with the food and pricing considering it was any airport, but that service was horrendous!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of pizza, but I sure won't mind eating pizza there, I'd say SERVICE is their BEST part, the waiter is constantly being attentive at our table, nice and friendly and quick on the order, their BBQ pizza is awesome, also the desert too, a bit pricey but I totally don't mind it because of the superb service they give, totally worth it. :)"}
{"text":"Almost missed my plane because \"5-7 minutes\" was more like 15-20, and the line was too long to get a refund for an $11 pizza. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I hate that my son spotted the CPK right across from the Admiral's Club, because I suspected that we would soon be in for an unpleasant detour. I was not wrong. Overpriced, tasteless pizza served by surly staff. I don't mind paying $12 for a pizza when it is hot and well prepared. I DO mind it when the server pulls the greasy box of pizza out from under a counter, where it had been sitting for God only knows how long. Nasty. This outlet takes advantage of hapless travelers."}
{"text":"Overpriced food in an airport terminal?  I can live with that.

Crappy pizza with horrible toppings?  Example: Buffalo chicken pizza covered in onions and \"buffalo sauce\".  

Give me Pizza Hut Express over this anyday.  This pizza is terrible."}
{"text":"This is a review for their salads only...

I've been to CPK so many times that I can count all the times with one hand. Yes, that is how many times I come to CPK. In any case all of the times that I've been here (about 2 or 3 times) I've always ordered a salad. Yes, ordering a salad in a pizza joint is probably not the best idea, BUT CPK's salads are pretty awesome. I came here last week, because my friend and I met up for lunch. I looked at the menu online before I went so we could have more time to talk and catch up. I decided to get the Original Chopped Salad (turkey breast, salami, cheese, basil, tomatoes, etc)  with the dressing on the side, no beans added. I ordered the \"half\" portion and it was huge! Lettuce was fresh, easy to eat and tasty. I definitely need to come back here more often when I am in the mood for a tasty salad and I actually had to bring half of the salad with me it was that big! CPK is definitely a winner for the salad department. I've had the Chinese Chicken Salad too which was pretty good but the Original Chopped is my favorite!

My friend had ordered their white pizza with NO bacon, but they brought it out with bacon. She tried eating it, but the bacon made it overly salty so they brought out a new one and they took off the price of the pizza entirely. Customer service was good and the manager even came over to apologize for the mistake. Overall, I will be back for a salad."}
{"text":"Perhaps we picked a bad choice for the pizza , It was the California club pizza and it was just dough as the base with a salad tossed on top then avocado slices thrown on top of that .. Overall it was messy to eat . We got a iced tea . And it was literally just ice with tea . Unsweetened . The lettuce wraps were pretty good tho . Overall , mehh"}
{"text":"Over time it has become better and more consistent. The service has remained consistently excellent and once again I recommend the Chicken Piccata with added mushrooms and Asparagus tips...."}
{"text":"One thing I've missed since moving from SoCal is CPK, so I was thrilled to get my fix while staying at the Mirage. I've passed this spot multiple times every time I stay at the Mirage but I always opted to dine elsewhere. Tonight was the night to try it out and I'm so happy I did.

Unlike a lot of places at the Mirage, CPK charges the same here as their standalone locations. Furthermore, they have the most varied gluten-free and vegetarian options of any of the dining locations here. They have gluten free salads, appetizers and they can make any pizza gluten free by using a cauliflower crust for a $2.50 add charge. 

The pizzas are great for sharing and pair nicely with a salad or appetizer. We had the bbq pizza $20 since we had cauliflower crust and a large Cobb salad $17. Everything was delicious and filling without feeling gross after.

While it isn't the best food you can get in Vegas, it's worthy of consideration when at the Mirage and wanting to eat for under $15 per person."}
{"text":"Pizza was salty. Menu at airport branch was not as inclusive as California branches. Expensive. I wish they had the arugula pizza. Sigh"}
{"text":"I thought the food here was okay.... Kind of pricey for what you get, maybe we will try something different next time. We ordered a pizza, the guacamole dip and the fish tacos, the fish tacos would've been better with a little sauce maybe, I'm definitely a sauce person and I guess the pizza and tacos seemed a little dry but I'll try something different next time."}
{"text":"My party and I split 2 apps and an entree. I was not thrilled by any. 
Atmosphere: located in a great area of the Mirage Hotel near the Las Vegas Strip entry doors. I like the round restaurant concept, it really added to the aesthetic. 
Service: excellent, from start to finish. 
Apps: Buffalo Cauliflower- hot cauliflower isn't on my list of must haves - I tried it - it's not for me, but others in my party said it was doable. Spinach dip was standard. No issues. 
Entree- we had tequila chicken spinach fettuccine. It was rather upsetting. Missing in action was the chicken, there were lots of peppers and onions, but still the flavor was missing. I guess I had higher expectations. I wish I had tried the pizza."}
{"text":"Restaurant: OK 
Service: What you expect. 
Eats: Hummus, BBQ Chicken Pizza 
Return Visits: Yes 

Restaurant is average, nothing fancy shmancy. 

The day we visited, it was on the weekend and it was pretty busy but we were seated right away. Our waitress did the usual; drink order, leave, food order, leave, check in #1, leave, check in #2, leave, check, bye-bye. Nothing over the top, she did her job but if I was to revisit, I wouldn't know who she was. 

Food was pretty good, I haven't been to CPK in years and I couldn't remember what the food tasted like but as far as I can tell, it tastes different, I don't remember it tasting the way that it did lol. It was pleasantly yummy! 

We intend to return, specially if we're at the mall and looking to get some yummies in our tummies."}
{"text":"I don't much like Yelping chain restaurants, but -- 

Pear and Gorgonzola pizza ($14?) is back! They discontinued it for a little while, but like Christ, it was resurrected. One of my favorite things to eat anywhere. And that is a lofty effing statement because I eat a lot. Like your mom.

Anyways. 

CPK is just one of my favorite eateries. They have a generously delicious menu of pizzas and pastas. I know, you're like, \"What does that sentence even mean?\" I mean: not only do they have a lot of items, but they have a lot of items that are GOOD. Dare I say great, even? I always come here, and although I know the menu like the back of my freakin' hand, it takes we a while to ponder over my favorite items and pick just one. So unfair. I want all! And a pony. 

The ingredients they use are like the quintessential ingredients of early 90's California. Stuff like sun-dried tomatoes and broccolini. Like, oh my god! And like California, the menu items are an amalgam of lots of cultures. Its like totally an extended metaphor! Totally! 

My favorites, besides the impeccable afore mentioned uber pizza, are the Sun-dried tomato and Broccolini Fusilli($13), Tomato Basil Spaghettini ($13; I swear it smells like ganja), and Tuscan Hummus ($8). 

The service is normally timely and friendly. 

I always leave with leftovers. Come hungry. Don't waste your time with the over-priced beers or froo froo specialty drinks. They only take up valuable space where you can be cramming more food. 

I'd probably be fat if I worked here. Amen."}
{"text":"I ordered the cedar plank salmon, and it was moist and delicious. My kids both had a personal pizza, and my wife had the chicken tequila.  Everyone loved their meals, but what really made this one of the best meals on our 10-day trip to Utah and Las Vegas was our server, Ashley.  She was so friendly and attentive; she was the epitome of customer service.  We chatted with her for a while, and she just really made us feel relaxed at home.  She also put an island touch (we are from Hawaii) on the butter cake dessert that she recommended.  It was delicious, and the delightful artwork (see the photo) was just the right touch.  Sometimes I run into people in this world who radiate so much joy that I think they are one of God's angels put on this earth to remind us  that love and kindness are what's most important.  Ashley's presence made this our best meal of the trip, and she is a real blessing to this restaurant and to the world we live in."}
{"text":"Terrible.  I was hoping this place would be a beacon of light in a very average airport. However it does the opposite. The coffee was undrinkable, the prep of the pizza was  poor at best, and the food came out cold.  I was going to send the pizza back but I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for it. I'm glad had a lot of time before my flight or I would have missed it with the slow service. I will go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Service was slow, server not attentive, grumpy angry face delivered dinner and literally threw it in front of me and turned away immediately.  Really?  Food ok, don't expect good service, however did notice at other tables server was pleasant, so it could happen."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner before going to see Cirque show. We were seated quickly, but the overall service was very slow. We only ordered salads so we thought it would be quick, but it wasn't. I think we were a bit overlooked because we weren't having an alcohol. Salads were fresh and tasted good. The Cobb was really good! We had separate checks and when the change was returned it was all off$5 on one bill. Apparently there is a cashier who assists the waitress, seems like it would be more accurate. It was resolved, but she questioned us, hmmm, it wasn't my error. Needless to say, it wasn't quick."}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch break and the service was horrible. Everything took forever. It took the server at least 10 minutes to take our drink order. Maybe 30 minutes for a half a salad a small pizza. And the funny thing is they weren't busy. This is not the place to go if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Save your money and go to Rubys.  The omelette was terrible. The breakfast potatoes were soaked in grease and soggy. They did not serve water and the service was slow and the manager needs to be replaced. Rude!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. 4 items on the breakfast menu, Denver omelette was OK (potatoes and toast were bad) but the service is miserable."}
{"text":"We had time before our flight took off so wandered into the CPK at the airport. Unfortunately, the experience left much to be desired. We took a seat and waited over ten minutes for anyone to show up. We almost walked out - wish we had. Once they did we decided to place our order in case the waitress never came back. After a very long wait for the drinks and food, our order finally arrived. It was ice cold. Now maybe ice cold pizza is the \"in thing\" in Cali right now. But I doubt it. More likely it had been sitting in the kitchen for too long. 

It also took repeated and drawn out efforts to get refills on our drinks. After being ignored for quite some time we managed to wave the waitress over. Her response was rather terse and rude. We then managed to get a nearby manager but it didn't help. In general they seem to care less about their customers. Perhaps they are all transients on their way somewhere else? They seemed to have had three ladies working the front podium and just one waitress working all the tables. And in general, all around bad attitudes. 

We always leave a generous tip but this time left none. As for California Pizza Kitchen it has now been removed from our list of dining choices. Why? Because when my wife tried to express her frustration the waitress just argued instead. Their management should realize that based on the majority of reviews for this location perhaps a change of staff is in order. They should start with that waitress. We made a call to CPK headquarters and gave them all pertinent information. So for those of you in the LV CPK location, if you can't serve your customers in a professional and timely manner please get a job with the Federal Government, you'd fit right in."}
{"text":"We came to the this location for the first time. We were seated promptly and Travis our server served us our drinks almost immediately. He was very friendly and seemed to be in a great mood which we enjoyed. 
The food was okay nothing that really stood out to us. The appetizers came right after we ordered them; however I ordered a pasta and once I received it I was not sure if mushrooms were in the pasta ( since I have a severe mushroom allergy ) it is something that I normally always ask. I didn't see 
that it was in the pasta but to be sure I went to ask. 

The woman who approached our table must have been a manager or some sort of higher position because she was not dressed in a polo like the servers but in a suit jacket. She failed to introduce herself but made sure her comments were in a very condescending tone. She informed me if I would have had mushrooms in my pasta I would have to ask for them! So instead of reassuring us there were no mushrooms she was being condescending and asked \"well how serious is your allergy really\" it was beyond appalling. 
Other then a disregard to potential health issue this place only gets these stars only because our server Travis was delightful and funny. He was a great server and always checked on us and brought us refills before we asked which is amazing !"}
{"text":"Always a great place to stop in for preflight cocktails, food and great service. One of my favorite things about flying Delta and the long haul to the D-Gates. Sitting at the bar or islands, you can charge you phone and indulge in my favorite ice tea... FYI - it's from Long Island. Price aren't jacked up from the normal California Pizza Kitchen prices & a great place to Turn Up!"}
{"text":"Pizza was just ok.  They do have  a really great cobb salad thats better eaten to go.  I usually just get that.   That salad makes the rating a 4 instead of a 3. That should say a lot"}
{"text":"Pizza came out cold, sent it back and came back \"nuked\". Now both my girlfriend and I are sick. Definitely avoid this place."}
{"text":"I ate a chicken Caesar club and my lettuce was browning, when I mentioned it they just said sorry when I was insinuating for them to replace the sand which... In addition it took forever to just ask for refills of water.. Go to the pizza place down the way instead!"}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I had such great pasta from a chain restaurant.  I was prepared to order a pizza until I saw a garlic pasta with the option of shrimp, chicken or mushrooms added... they allowed me to add all three and it was excellent! The shrimp were markedly delicious... which I did not expect from a pizza establishment!  The added bonus was the proximity of the large screens at the betting booths nearby that were featuring the Spurs game while we ate."}
{"text":"It's CPK, so it'll be pretty consistent wherever you go. Pricey, but consistent. 
Knocked off a couple stars this time because service was pretty forgettable. And my pizza had a good amount of leftover flour on the underside, which made for an odd dining experience. I personally don't like the taste of raw flour, but perhaps they are starting a new trend? Shrugs."}
{"text":"I usually like eating at CPK but this one honestly isn't good whatsoever. The waitress rushed us to order as soon as we got there. We barley sat down and she was already asking what we wanted to eat. I ordered plain pasta with grilled chicken and the chicken was hard and chewy. It was like eating a piece of gum. It was honestly the worst chicken I have ever ate. I asked a different lady that works there if the chicken is cooked enough and showed her my plate and she even said that something was wrong with it because it was so hard to cut. My waitress said that it was \"normal\" and that the chef is strict on temperature of food. Well guess what? my mother is a chef and I know what chicken is supposed to taste like and this was definitely not it. 
I highly don't recommend this place. Don't eat here so you don't risk getting sick. 
Also the prices are wayyyyy higher than any other CPK I have been to. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!"}
{"text":"This was a decent place to get some food in your stomach late at night after a long day of drinking and gambling. Got a hawaiian pizza which was ok for $14 I guess. Besides that... nothing special."}
{"text":"I ordered food to go from this restaurant. My husband got the short ribs over Mac n Cheese and I got the roasted veggie salad *with blackened salmon added*. Out of habit I checked the bag and realized that my husband's food was missing. She realized the mistake and gave me his food out of the warmer. We left and when we got home I noticed that they did not add the salmon. Now, I would not have left my house if it wasn't for the fact that the salmon was +$6 added to the $16 salad. I called and they told me to call when I got outside and they would bring it out. I called and the woman stated \"I will be out in one minute\". I waited about 7 minutes and just went in. The +$6 salmon was literally about 5 small pieces of salmon. I requested to speak to the manager bc that was robbery! He stated \"This is what you get for $6? Wow!\" Which was questionable bc you are a manager, you should know. Nonetheless, they were kind enough to take the salad and salmon off of my bill all together which I appreciated. I still took off two stars bc the food was not worth $44. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Um... No.

When you are out to enjoy the night with a great friend, the last thing you want to do is go to a restaurant with terrible service.

My buddy ordered a cosmopolitan (which took forever to even order) and they totally forgot.  The waitress never came around, and it seems like the whole time we were looking for her.  Coming from a hospitality background, I understand that it gets busy.  Looking around the restaurant on this particular night, it was not.  It was a weekday and there were a ton of empty tables.

When we finally got our food, it was just ok.  Now mind you, I have eaten at CPK before, and the food was better.  Maybe this location just sucks.  I'd rather compete with the tourist traffic and go to the Mirage one."}
{"text":"Breakfast was bad. Coffee was bitter. Omelette was so so. Potatoes had been in Warner so long they were hard and had a crust so hard you could not bite through it. Breakfast is better somewhere else."}
{"text":"Decent lunch stop in between flights. Spendy for a tuna melt and chicken pesto melt plus drinks, but it's the airport and close to our outgoing gate. Really tasty for a melt sandwich."}
{"text":"A typical CPK. But this place gave me an explosive bowel issues a few hours later.
Thank god for pepto bismol!"}
{"text":"Ha a group of six. The initial service was quick and friendly. It took about 30 minutes from order to table for our meal. They never brought the bread and butter. The rap water smelled funny too. The Margarita pizza left a bit to be desired. There was not enough basil, tomato or mozzarella to call it Margarita. It was really a cheese pizza with basil. The ceaser salad, pesto, chicken lettuce wraps, meat lovers pizza and California club salad were all good."}
{"text":"CPK is always a winner. I have never had a bad meal here. This Town Square location can get pretty crazy around high feeding time....be careful if you sit in their waiting area as the pony walls are designed for you to bang you head on when you lean back...ouch!
You can expect such a successful franchise as this to have their system down which they do. Upon seating, we are greeted immediately with drink order requests. I love the mango iced tea and my wife enjoys the cranberry cooler...a drink she would order before they put it on the menu...cranberry juice, club soda and limes...all with free refills :) You now have to ask for bread as it is not automatically served.
Salad, pizza or pasta? That is the question to ask when browsing the menu.
Ok 3 words...Kung Pao Spaghetti...whaaat?! I love this dish and surprised other venues haven't copied it yet. Spicy, dark kung pao sauce tossed with spaghetti, green onions, peanuts and dried red peppers. CPK does Kung Pao spaghetti better than most Chinese restaurants do Kung Pao chicken.
The bolognese is also very good and better than what I've tried at most Italian restaurants. The fusili with this meat sauce is all my daughter will order.
Their thin crust margharita pizza is also another fave. Thin crispy crust with Italian tomatos, fresh mozzarella and basil...simple yet good.
Their signature BBQ chicken pizza is also good with carmelized onion and sweet bbq sauce.
Their salads are the best and usually the half portion is plenty for one. I like their Caesar salad with salmon pieces for lunch...quick and healthy.
They also offer a small cravings menu that has things like a wedge salad, fresh iceberg lettuce wedge, blue cheese dressing (try it with their ranch dressing), bacon bits and chopped egg. The avocado corn dip with tortilla chips is great for sharing.
Their latest special offered is the quinoa salad...a great choice for the vegetarian in your group and fills you up. 
Whatever you order, CPK has found a way to make it, maybe not in the very best way but in a way that you will like it and come back for more."}
{"text":"As far as airport food goes this was a great spot. I loved that the pizza was ready (yes i know that makes it less \"fresh\") because we were in a rush to catch our connecting flight and were starving! 
Had the chicken BBQ one and it was delicious, since this is my first time at California Pizza I am not sure I can compare the airport pizza to their normal locations but I admit the airport pizza was delicious. 

Thankful this place was here because every other option that was ready to go was bland (salads and sammiches). 

Will be checking out one of their restaurants soon so that I can compare but super happy with the experience and food quality."}
{"text":"Everything thing is great here at CPK. The food is very yummy and very welcome. Its hard to find parking here but you'll find one, (just park at Nordstrom).  What really made me give this place 5 stars instead of 4 stars is mostly because of the service. The service was amazing! The manger made everyone happy and wonderful. Also, the waiters/waitresses were really kind and was at the top of their class."}
{"text":"This California Pizza kitchen at the airport most likely the worst service I ever got at this chain. I ordered three eggs over easy WELL done with potatoes sausage and wheat toast. Specifically ordered no bacon. Waitress brought two eggs soft and a wad of bacon. That one I returned. Second attempt was three eggs runny and a WAD of bacon. Now I'm ticked off! What's so hard about this order. There seemed to have been a lot of tensions among the personnel. Tables not bussed employees running around like chickens with no head and screaming and yelling from the kitchen. What a mess. Clearly a poorly managed establishment"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for awhile now and this place was just recently remodeled, looks much better, was packed full of people, and the food quality appears to be better. The bread and oil they bring out once your seated it excellent! Well presented."}
{"text":"Came to here to eat because we wanted some salad.  We ordered the BBQ Chicken salad and decided to indulge in a chocolate/ice cream dessert.

I gave this place a 3 star because although the food was okay, the service was not up to par.  The salad was appetizing and can feed two people.  The dessert was also fantastic because the ice cream and chocolate just complimented each other.  The service though was a little disappointing.  When I eat, I drink a lot of water.  And let's say it was hard to get a full glass of water.  It was very difficult to get the attention of the waitresses because they would rather tend to larger groups.  I even had a waitress make eye contact with me and totally look away."}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends! The portions are able to be shared and we had such a fun time trying different dishes. My favorite pizza is the California club pizza and I recommend trying the ma and cheese as well!"}
{"text":"This food at this location, located inside the Mirage Casino, was no different than any other CPK location. Maybe better in a way, since we ordered it and ate poolside at our loungechairs. I don't really eat at places like this usually, just because it's so plain and boring. But, being in Vegas, but it was quick, cheap, and was great for a quick lunch by the pool that day. You can eat there, order it to-go, or even have it sent up to your room or over to the pool."}
{"text":"No different than a normal CPK.  Grabbed a later night pie and ate it in the room.  Went BBQ Chicken, their specialty.  Good as always.

Good service and food came out fast.  Another bonus for the Mirage."}
{"text":"Great customer service and the server was really friendly with a smile on her face:). This really made my eating at Vegas good."}
{"text":"We used to love this place but then they changed! They changed a salad that my girlfriend absolutely loved. It probably didn't seem like a big change to the staff out was a change to the dressing and then they changed the easy they did the chicken on top. The real problem came with how it was handled. When my girlfriend expressed a concern and said out want what she was used to the manager decided to argue with her and tell her she was wrong then ultimately admitted that out was a changed recipe. Needles to dry because of her attitude in the beginning we probably will not be back!"}
{"text":"I am tempted to give this place 4 stars for service, but the food was closer to 3 stars. If I could, I give it 3.5 stars.

Heather was my waiter one night at this CPK location. I had a two hour layover to Washington DC and she was very friendly and courteous. Service was fast and she checked in with me multiple times.

Food: I ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza and the Red Velvet Cake for dessert. This CPK location has a limited menu, but nevertheless it soothe my cravings. I would also argue that there aren't that many great eateries at the Las Vegas airport. CPK was decent and its food deserves a 3 star. The velvet cake was actually pretty good. It wasn't super sweet and the icing was just perfect. The pizza could be improved as I felt it could have felt fresher by the time I got it. Total came out to be $19.76 before tip (including tax).

Service: I have to give my waitress Heather (id #4020) a four star rating. She was very friendly and helpful. She recommended the velvet cake to me too. Service was unrushed and she took my order relatively fast. 

Overall, I had no problem with this CPK and I never felt rushed even though I sat here, ate slowly, and killed time while waiting for my next flight. My waitress was great and the food was all right (especially considering it's an airport). Not a bad place to kill some time instead of sitting in uncomfortable seats by the terminal gate."}
{"text":"We ate here for dinner because my friends did not want to pay the 30 bucks to eat at cravings. The line looked long, but we were seated in like 10 mins. We got seated at the bar and our bartender/waiter was named James/Jim. He was great. He seemed serious, but he was super nice and funny! 

The only thing that I did not like was that I was sitting at the edge of the bar next to where the waiters pick up the food. Sitting there I can hear all the problems and arguments between the waiters  and chef waiting for the food. But now I see that it is difficult to be a waiter when your ass is on the line and your co workers are being slow or getting the orders wrong."}
{"text":"Yes, I am reviewing a chain restaurant and the world did not stop spinning.  To my credit though, it was in an airport which is the only reason I am reviewing it.

If you travel a lot or a little, one thing is for sure... airport food typically sucks and the service is even worse.  And the last thing you want before you go on a long flight is bad food.  So, I figure I will help out my fellow Yelpers hung over from Vegas.

We were heading out on a morning flight, and wanted to sit down and have a quick breakfast.  Looking around at the options, I figured I would roll the dice once more while out here and grab something at CPK.  Well damn... it was actually decent!  First off, the service was great.  I know it is all about the waiter you get, but ours was great.  And trust me, in an airport that is few and far between!  For the food, I had a breakfast type pizza and it was actually good.  Holy crap!  Was I hung over and not caring?  Maybe so... but I expect 95% of the others looking for breakfast to be the same.  Good eggs, good crust and the coffee was decent too.

That is all... an unusual chain restaurant review from me.  But hell, giving that I just rated a $100 per person place with 2 stars and this with 3 has to mean something!"}
{"text":"I honestly was planning on eating at another restaurant in the airport, but their service was too slow and frankly, I had a flight to catch. Pizza sounded... meh... but I was hungry and needed a bite.

Ordered a regular cheese pizza (personal size) and a 20oz. bottle of coke, which racked up to $12.21. ACK! I could have ordered a REAL plate of food elsewhere. On the upside of the receipt, there is a \"coupon\" for 10% off the gelato place next door.

Seating area was pretty small, very little room for single-person seating. Limited condiments for your pizza. I found a few packets of red peppers, but no parmesan cheese.

Flavor was lacking, pizza was very bland. Sauce had very little flavor, crust could have been out of a box. The only reason they got 3 stars is because it's the fastest way to get food in an airport. Unforunately, that means that you don't know how long your food has been sitting there, just waiting for an unsuspecting victim to order..."}
{"text":"I love CPK, but this was the worst CPK experience I have ever had.  They must use different recipes or something because the BBQ chicken pizza (which I get every time I go here) was disgusting.  The chicken seemed undercooked or something - I actually had to spit a few pieces out.  We also split a chopped salad which looked as though it had been sitting out for a week.  There were dirty dishes sitting at several tables the entire time we were there.  No one bothered to clean anything up... and they weren't even all that busy. 

Save your money and get a sandwich at Port of Sub or somewhere instead... there is one very close to this CPK in the airport."}
{"text":"I tried the lunch sized Spinach, Pepperoni, and Sausage Pizza and Super Spinach + Quinoa Salad combo. I also tried the white corn guacamole and tortilla chips. It was all delicious. The guacamole is some of the best I have had anywhere. I either had Coca-Cola or Pibb Extra. I can't remember. But the pop machine concentration and taste was just right. I had an excellent server. One of the best. Great experience."}
{"text":"What do you expect for Airport food? The service was very good though."}
{"text":"The hummus is runny - definitely pass on it, horrible.

The pizza is pretty decent although overpriced. As a local I come to expect better quality food for paying such prices since there are so many off strip options."}
{"text":"After dinner dessert: Chocolate soufflé and Butter cake are amazing! Inside Mirage Casino Hotel, a lot of TV to watch games. The servers were very friendly.
But don't get the hot tea, they serve Lipton."}
{"text":"Just home from another good meal with old friends. As always your food is great, special shout out to our server George, you are not only a great server your very polite you have an engaging personality and your very quick witted, continued success in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Worse customer service ever. I fly a lot and also own a store in the airport.  
I ordered a pizza to go, Had an emergency call to make that last almost 40 min. I came  back to the restaurant to pick up the pizza and asked them to heat for me, As I never opened it and never picked it up, And they said no. We are not allowed. Why don't you offer a new one then? Because it's my fault? What a good service you offer ?

This restaurant is managed by the Hudson group who manage the restaurant in this airport. Worse bad service, Worse management."}
{"text":"I think this is an excellent place to have lunch. It's located at the mall sometimes they're crowded so you do have to be careful. When I go for lunch I get the half veggies salad. What a great invention if you add goat cheese is even better."}
{"text":"It's a CPK, so it's pretty much what you'd expect from a CPK.

And that is: fresh, decent, quick serve restaurant-fare in a sit-down setting. Service was prompt and helpful and friendly.

They have a number of new items which seem to push them into the territory of 'more serious' restaurant. And that includes a salmon dish for close to $20. I almost never order salmon out anyway, and that's probably not going to sway me.

For a informal business lunch, it works just fine here. The tortilla soup has a bit of bit, and a good deal of flavor. CPK has always been a soup-place for some, and I was happy to dive in myself.  A Cobb salad, I think, is what I had next. Perfectly fine, if not terribly robust. The chunks of turkey/chicken were a presence in the salad, but really didn't stand out. The avocado made itself better known, and that was fine. The shredded Romaine was adequate, if not terribly flavorful.

Nice chill atmosphere in the middle of a very busy Mall."}
{"text":"So I am not a fan of CPK normally and would not go there for a meal however in this instance I was in the airport and they were one of the only places serving a sit-down breakfast.  I am glad I went there.  I was very impressed with the selection of menu items for breakfast and the quality of the food.  I saw some pretty harsh reviews from the past so someone must have read them and either hired a new chef or something because everything I had was great.  And the kicker....it was reasonably priced!  I know in an airport!"}
{"text":"A perfectly serviceable airport restaurant. Nice staff, usual sort of pizza fare, although pizza size is smaller than you might expect. Not heavingly busy, so you can kill time waiting for your flight."}
{"text":"I ordered what seems to be a very simple dish, spring greens with chicken. The salad was drenched in dressing. Too sour. Luckily I wasn't very hungry. I just needed a place to sit before my flight. The little bits of chicken was not very good either. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Had to come here because Oregano's was crazy as usual (1 1/2 hr wait...) and with a party of 12... that would have been a disaster.... but we went to CPK and still had to wait 1 1/2 hrs for our food.... hmmm, not sure we made the best choice.  And like others said... had to ask for the bread and butter even though we were clearly starving and not willing to order the $10 appetizers...  but gave in anyway... so when we asked the waiter how long our food would be cause we were thinking of ordering and appetizer he said our appetizer would be out before the food... but low and behold... food comes out 2 mins later.... hmmm... sounded a little tricky to me.  Food was good, but not as good as Oregano's and will remember that that 1 1/2 hr wait Oregano's is worth it.  But the company was wonderful and it made up for the temporary starvation."}
{"text":"I am not a huge pizza fan, but I trust the opinion of my dad and husband in that it's \"meh\" and okay. That's my reason for docking one star.. It is after all Callifornia PIZZA kitchen, lol. I do love their Italian chopped salad though, which is the only thing I've ever ordered there since I found it.  Actually it'd been years since I went there and just had it twice this week. Yum! I also discovered their new Fresh Strawberry Mango cooler. I will choose a place to eat based on the drinks alone... For example, I'll opt out of places with Coke products for a place with Pepsi, even if the coke place has slightly better food. Anyway back to my review... The server was kind and quick enough. The food was good and timely. CPK is pretty consistent as a chain and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Pizza was small, high priced and overdone. Asked bartender if he could change station on TV since it had gone off the air and he said that management would not allow them to change station unless he got permission. Guy next to me would wondered why they had not chilled some liquor and response was that bottle had to be empty before the warm replacement bottle could be chilled. How screwed up is this ownership, HMS Host?"}
{"text":"We got hungry while shopping so decided to eat here as opposed to spend another $30/person at other fancy restaurants. CPK was something we were all familiar with - especially the prices. 

The moroccan chicken salad lacked chicken (I think we got like 5 pieces total), but was generous with the avocado. The Hawaiian bbq chicken pizza was delicious, it's one of my fav now.

The service was amazing. Our server turned out to be the bartender as well, and was able to keep up with our food and drink orders. The mojito was really good, and the Long Island was perfect!"}
{"text":"I've been a CPK fan ever since I lived in Hong Kong. I remember taking the time off with my family after church to enjoy their garlic cream fettucine which we did again a couple of nights ago. In addition to that, we had an order of their roasted garlic chicken pizza as well as their classic caesar's salad. 

Every experience here brings in an aura of nostalgia. The food tasted exactly the same as it did back in Hong Kong around 2008, down to the very last detail. And by that, I mean the food is very flavorful and rich. Mind you, the garlic fettucine tends to get a little oily so with my mom's gallstone concerns, I had to limit the amount she was taking in or else it would cause a stomach upset (bilary cholic is what they call it if memory serves me well) 

Aside from that, this is a good place to hang out after a long day of walking around the mall. They're pretty family-oriented too. The table next to us was a family of 3 with a cute little girl and she was given some crayons and coloring sheets for her enjoyment. She doodled her way through dinner and looked like she had a lot of fun. Staff is friendly and you have the choice whether to eat inside or outside - where you could watch people walk by. Overall, the experience was pleasant and we were happily stuffed."}
{"text":"Really slow service for a restaurant. On a Monday just after Christmas in Vegas, you need to anticipate your customers specially when you know The Mirage is booked completely, which is where this restaurant is. They seemed under staffed. We were not seated for almost 15 mins at 7:45pm which should be the busiest time, however with so many tables that we could see were clean and available and no reservations taken, this was just weird. 
Finally thanks to a server, we could get a table, as he kept pushing the fellow at the concierge to get us in as many tables were available. Once seated, we decided our menu right away as we were suppose to watch the show on Treasure Island and it was already 8:10 pm now. We were looking at every available server who was running around but not one came for taking our order. Finally after asking the concierge to send someone, we had a server, who took all our order at once and thankfully also asked the cook to accommodate our request of serving faster. We did get the food in 20 mins and since we didn't have much time, had to gulp our food faster.
The penne cream with shrimp was tasty but the Thai crunch salad with chicken was missing something. Couldn't figure out what, as it wasn't tasting the same as it does normally. Nevertheless thanks to the servers who saw our agony and helped us get out of there in an hour.
Lesson learned- Go here when you have plenty of time to churn."}
{"text":"New pizza dough is horrible!!! I really hope CPK goes back to the old pizza!"}
{"text":"This is a really good 3+ star CPK.  Tables turn quickly here and there's no problem getting a seat.  Our server Rascheed was on top of his game.  He very expertly guided us through potential vegan options on the menu.  Chose the Roasted Veggie Salad which turned out to be tasty warm vegetables over cool romaine which was different, but not in a bad way.  We also split an order of Wild Mushroom Strozzapreti with house marinara sauce.  Sounded better than the actual dish as our menu experimentation came up as \"interesting, but I wouldn't try that again.\"
Marinara Sauce had a distinct BBQ flavor which was weird with pasta and the dish was over salted for me.  So we're probably guilty of dragging the average star rating down because we couldn't just let the menu items be but that's the way it went on our night in Legacy Village."}
{"text":"Nice large portions in a bright welcoming room. We came for a weekday lunch. I had a meat pizza; the Mrs. had a salad. Both were fine, but nothing was especially memorable about it. 

I would have loved to have sampled the best pizza in Vegas, but figured it would not likely be at CPK. That was the case.

This is not a bad place to go if you have to be trapped in the Fashion Show Mall."}
{"text":"It's CPK.  Typically the food is consistent.  The last time in the waitress was just not that good.  I hate leaving a small tips, but in this case I think it was warranted.  I just don't get how a person that LIVES on tips can be so poor at it.  My guess is she may not be living on tips much longer."}
{"text":"A California Pizza Kitchen in Nevada, this must be a mirage or something. 

First off, my friends and his buddies were in town so not my choice of place to eat. So Vegas locals, don't burn me at the stake for eating here. Yes I committed a sin, forgive me.

Like most restaurants at a casino, you feel like you're eating at the casino. If you get the outside booths, you literally will be within 1 feet of customers waiting in line, with no real dividers. Investing in glass dividers to allow for some privacy would help. Luckily, we got one of the inside booths. 

The bread wasn't very good, questionably stale. I usually like the bread at CPK too. If sushi bars can get fresh fish to the desert, CPK should be able to get some non crappy fresh bread.

The four cheese ravioli with sautéed mushroom was just okay. Usually sautéed mushrooms have more flavor, but it was just lacking in the dish. After finishing the dish, I felt that disgusted can't believe I ate that feeling. Just something about the sauce made me feel this way.

My friend's spaghetti with tomato and meat sauce just didn't look very appetizing. He took a couple of bites and stopped.

Food came out fairly quickly, but don't expect to really get the great service of a traditional restaurant. You will have to flag the waiters if you want anything. 

My meal came out to around $16, which for a casino restaurant isn't bad. But had I gone to local spots, I would get better food and value. Not a bad place, but pales in comparison to the real CPK back in California."}
{"text":"We had just gotten off a plane, settled into our hotel across the street, and were meeting my cousins at the Mirage. We were hungry! We decided on the California Pizza Kitchen and we weren't disappointed. I had the Kung Pao Spaghetti and my friend had the Thai Crunch salad! Both of these were awesome!! I really loved how they were able to combine all the flavors of Kung Pao in the spaghetti! We both wanted to lick our plates!

I'd eat there again in a heart beat!!!"}
{"text":"Yuck. 

Expensive nonsense and slooooow service.  The food was worse than a microwave or hospital cafeteria.  Almost inedible.

Beer was cold but expensive.

SKIP this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Normally I like CPK but the one at Mccarran airport is terrible. Poor service, inedible salad that had brown edges, & I had to send my tea back cause the cup was dirty. Never again."}
{"text":"So I went to California Pizza Kitchen from my first time ever. I never thought of it as being a great restaurant to eat at but I was pleasantly surprised. I was thinking they just basically had pizza there. However they have salads main courses appetizers and other items on the menu besides pizza. I actually ordered a salmon salad which was very very good. for those of you out there that think California Pizza Kitchen only has pizza you're wrong. They have a wide variety of other items on the menu in the prices are not bad."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to CPK in a few years and I met up with someone here over the weekend. Our server was SUPER friendly and attentive from beginning to end. I strayed from my clutch California club pizza and had the thin crust sicilian which was okay. Will I be back? Probably not to this location since it's not in my area, but I had no real complaints."}
{"text":"Great quick meal before hitting the tables again. Crust on the pizza was just right.    Drinks stayed filled."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this CPK location several times on past Vegas trips, but my most recent experience was sadly disappointing. They definitely updated their menu and got rid of my favorite pizza (the caramelized onion - goat cheese - arugula one), but I was still hopeful about the items I chose (the avocado club egg rolls and the Thai Chicken pizza).

Sadly, between the spotty/downright slow service and the fact that both items I ordered were just okay, I doubt I'll be eating at CPK anytime soon (I mean, it's a chain, so one must assume all of their food is generally the same). The biggest problem with both the egg rolls and my pizza was that they were downright bland.

Price-wise, everything was average for Vegas (the egg rolls were something like $13.50 and the pizza was $17.50) but honestly there *are* places on and around the Strip where you can get better food for the same prices or cheaper. Unless you just really want to eat at a CPK, I'd say avoid bothering with this one."}
{"text":"as you know i despise trendy places, even if they have been around for a long time.  Mesa is usually behind the times anyway, and now has a CPK, but i was not impressed.  i like my pies big and heavy, these are small and very healthy looking.  I got lucky with this visit, they burnt the bottom of my pizza and had to bring me another and didn't charge me for it so i couldn't complain about the high price for this little pie.  great for groups and having good conversation, but next time i will have my pizza delivered and enjoy the taste and forget the company."}
{"text":"Food was great & so was service. 
Love this place. 
Caesars salad is delicious. The staff is very friendly and our waiter was great."}
{"text":"Ate here early before the dinner rush- simple but good food. Service was decent, but not overly friendly. My favorite part of this cpk is that it was a great people watching spot in the Mirage casino. Our favorite dish was definitely the salad with fruit and grilled peaches."}
{"text":"I call CPK, safe adventure.  It's great when you have to go somewhere with a large group, and you don't want to cave into a totally non-descript chain.  Everyone can find something on the menu that they can tolerate, and I actually think the pizzas are quite good.  The prices are average, and the service is typically friendly.  The next time you have a business meeting or large group to accomodate, I recommend it."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the food quality- since this is located in the airport. The tequila lime pasta was excellent, I would get this every time! We also tried the sausage and poblano flatbread- not so good. The poblano peppers prepared like this tasted bitter. But overall good service and food for the airport."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat salads they have the best salad decent atmosphere good service but they have really good salad sounds really good though they're really good salads Thai crunch salad is very good my favorite"}
{"text":"Love their BBQ, spicy chipotle and Tostada pizza. The pesto and garlic Alfredo pastas are also good. Ordered the fish tacos twice, did not like it either times. Also, I have to say, their drinks are bad every time I tried it. The CF (across the street) $5.50 happy hour mojito taste 100x better than any of the CPK's mojitos at this location. 
Tip: if you're looking for curbside pick up, it's across from stir crazy!"}
{"text":"I've always had catering from med reps at work, me & my boyfriend decided to give it a try In person, very great service from the moment we walked in, & very great food!!! We are r sure our waitresses name but her name tag said \"princess\" she's very good @ her job, she was also bartending & made sure to tend to our needs as well, she also makes a bomb PIÑA COLADA! overall a very great restaurant & experience! Only thing I could recommend is maybe a bigger dish size (even though I didn't eat all of mine) lol I hope a manager or someone sees this so she can get some credit!!!"}
{"text":"Needed dinner after LOOOOOOONG day. On our way to see Cirque du Soleil's Love. Pizza sounded so good. And it was! Our waitress was lovely, kind, and efficient. We split the Sicilian. Really well done tonight. No need to use pepper flakes. Love their crust."}
{"text":"Service is good. Food is great. Too many kids running around.
More like a glorified pizza place at a mall food court."}
{"text":"I came for pasta but it wasn't 11 am yet. However, the breakfast was delicious. It is rare that I find restaurants that cook my over medium eggs just right without them being over cooked or still runny but they were perfect. My only complaint is they are so busy it took forever to get a refill and the check."}
{"text":"I love CPK... but this one in the airport is the pits.  I had maybe two very small pieces of chicken in my $12.99 sandwich!   Absolutely ridiculous....a complete scam location!  DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Huh? What? I ate here. Oh yeah. That place with the really really expensive salads, that sounded good on paper, but were boring,  and the really not too great service. The dining experience was great due to good company, but unless I have like.. a 75% coupon, I won't be back."}
{"text":"This isn't the best place in the world to eat.  We had few options near our gate and little time to get something.  So for a late brunch breakfast, we picked this place.  I had a breakfast panini.
It was bacon and egg panini and super dry.  I had to cover it with hot sauce and mayo.  It wasn't the best, but not the worst.  It took us a while to get waited on because the lady who was suppose to take the order was out socializing with a friend in the dinning area.  
I should have ordered a pizza instead.  I won't be back to be honest."}
{"text":"My first CPK experience was here at the Mirage Hotel.  My fiance was playing at the Roulette table and the pit boss came over to say 'Hi'.  He asked if we were hotel guests and we said 'No'.  He said he hoped we'd consider staying at the Mirage in the future and gave us a food voucher for $60.  Now, that was a surprise since we were not big players and had only played for 15 minutes or so.  Casino comps guests all the time but usually to big players and only if you have played for awhile.  Nevertheless, we gladly accepted the hospitality.  

We decided to give CPK a try.  The wait was horrendous!  We were in line for at least 45 minutes.  Once seated, the service was sooooo slow.  It took forever to get our drinks and for the waitress to take our orders.  Then it took another life time for the food to arrive!  We ordered Spring Rolls (Vietnamese style), Kung Pao Spaghetti with Shrimp & Chicken, and Chicken Tequilla Fettuccine.  I can't remember what we ordered for dessert or if did at all!

We are not big fans of Vietnamese style Spring Rolls.  We actually ordered them by mistake thinking they were Egg Rolls (deep fried).  Duh!  So we only took a bite to taste and didn't care for them.  

I fell IN LOVE with my Kung Pao Spaghetti at first bite.  It was flavorful and spicy.  Who would have thought to cook Kung Pao with Spaghetti noodles?  The peanuts gave the noodle extra kick. My fiance loved his Chicken Tequilla Fettuccine, too.  He even used the bread to pick up any sauce left over on the plate.  Yes I know, it's not proper etiquette, but this is no 5-star restaurant.  

We only ordered iced tea since neither one of us is a drinker.  And I honestly couldn't remember if we ordered any dessert and if we did, what it was!  All I could remember was that we were stuffed and didn't even use up all $60!!!  

We have been back to CPK at different locations since (most often at Brea where it's the closest to home), and we order the same thing every time because that's how much we like them!  I have even learned to make Kung Pao Spaghetti at home and it's a hit with everyone.  Well, I am Chinese, so I'd better know my Kung Pao!

Service could vary quite a bit depending on locations.  But it's a chain restaurant, so you can expect consistency in the food quality."}
{"text":"These guys suck! Horrible people, horrible service. Do waste your time or money! Did not enjoy the experience period! Try a vending truck for better luck!"}
{"text":"Very clean place, staff is well trained, located in the Town Square plaza so it's a great place to eat after shopping."}
{"text":"Went again, I'm a huge fan but this time something was off. Our waiter wasn't the most friendly lady and kept wanting to take plates away from our table. Whatever. The pizza was good we got chipotle chicken. The lime cream sauce was a little watery compared to usual, tasted the same tho. We also got a app which was corn chips with white corn avocado, I don't recommend that. The avocado isn't smashed and doesn't pair well with white corn. There was no taste or seasoning to it as well."}
{"text":"This  is our favorite restaurant in the Fashion Show Mall, our server Michael Eichhorn is awesome, he has a great personality and always make us feel like home. He is very knowledgeable about everything on the menu. We have never been disappointed with his food or drinks recommendations. This is the place to come for great food and service!"}
{"text":"Great pizza awesome service. They have outdoor area (outside the restaurant, still inside the mall tho). Beautiful environment all around.

They start you off with olive oil with some seasoning and French bread.

For appetizer I ordered the spinach artichoke and tortilla chips. Spinach artichoke was very creamy and the tortilla chips wonderfully colorful.

Ordered the carne asada pizza. Very delicious and flavorful. Comes with a green salsa on the side which blended very well with the pizza.

Overall experience was good. Food was awesome"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this location! This location is gorgeous and a really sweet treat if you are shopping at the Fashion Show. I have been visiting this location for years and it is definitely my favorite location. The manager, Jamie, is the sweetest thing since butter cake (if you haven't tried it, PLEASE TRY IT NOW!)

I usually come to this location to stop by and visit some old friends, Casey, one of the best servers I have ever had in any dining establishment. (*Quick story*We met Casey at his old restaurant Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and one day stumbled across him serving at CPK at Fashion Show. It's a good thing because the quality of the food at Sammy's has gone down, and the quality of service/food/overall dining at CPK has gone up!) I like to credit some of that to the amazing server, Casey, that always knows how to have a party! That guy always asks about our kids, how we are doing, how life is going, and how the food is tasting! 

Jamie, his boss, is the coolest gal around! Casey ran to his boss and introduced us to her, gave her the whole story how we basically stalked him, and now we run into him 2x/month. She is always so excited to see us come in, which makes each visit worth while. I absolutely love being welcomed with open arms, makes this place feel like a home away from home.

As for the food, the little bite are always a good treat before the meal. I usually indulge in the mac n cheese bites, or the flat breads, because they're usually really delicious! I also go for the seasonal salad, it's like watermelon with feta, to die for!! 

The pizzas are always good, but there's something about the pastas here that keeps me coming back. I really love this location and the hospitality I receive. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"CPK used to be one of my guilty pleasures. The pizza with salad on top, now known as the Tostada pizza was my go to. I know it sounds weird, but it's absolutely delicious...normally. 

Now, I can't speak for all locations, but at this one the edge of the crust was so dry and burnt, while the inside was so tough and doughy that it was almost impossible to cut into. As this is a salad pizza it is a knife and fork job."}
{"text":"Breakfast is paninis...and very good. On this occasion I had the egg and cheese panini, which was delicious. With coconut water for hydration on the plane.

On the way back I'll be ready for  pizza...they will customize ingredients!"}
{"text":"Great place to have fresh tasting salads prices are a bit extreme though. Two fish tacos for $12.00 amongst a few other small portioned things. They really should have a \"HAPPY HOUR\"  Menu like the other places near by...Brio...Yard house etc..."}
{"text":"Breakfast at CPK! 
Not many options as I fly back from Vegas....pretty good Florentine omelet. Coffee in a glass cup. 
Bran muffin (my choice). 
Potato fries (while tasty I wish there were other breakfast side choices)."}
{"text":"CPK - Mirage Casino Las Vegas 

http://www.mirage.com/restaurants/california-pizza-kitchen.aspx

We had just checked in the Mirage and needed a quick bite before hooking up with the rest of our group.  We stopped in for a late lunch around 2:30 or so with no waiting time for a table.  Our waiter was very good and the rest of the service was the same as well.  We found the food to be just okay and nothing really special.  We ordered their signature BBQ Chicken Pizza which was good, but the salads were pretty weak with bottled dressings.  The prices were typical to Las Vegas; it was around $60 for lunch for the 3 of us.  We would pass on CPK next time."}
{"text":"I asked for Hawaiian pizza it was okay nothing surprising place is just normal I had a couple of beers and ate a small pizza good flavor but nothing outstanding"}
{"text":"Our 1st nite staying at the Mirage on 2/7 , we went downstairs and decided to order pizza for take-out.  As my daughter paid and picked up the pizza, she asked our server, Jim, for some plates. Jim looked at her quizzically and asked why.  She replied that we wanted to eat in our room.  He returned with 4 plastic lids from take out containers and asked her if she was \"from the bum jungle, you know, outside?\"  She was taken aback and restated that we are guests in the hotel simply wanting to eat upstairs.  He shrugged and walked away. Very upset by this exchange, my daughter spoke to the manager who was very unhelpful, simply saying that \"he is usually very nice\".  

Well, understandably that ruined our evening, especially when we found we could have ordered a room service pizza for less, and received all the accompaniments we needed.  I will definitely be forwarding my pictures of the take-out lids/plates given to us for our dining pleasure, but feel you need to be aware of the shoddy customer service provided by your casino restaurant wait staff.  In hindsight, I wish I would have returned the pizza and gone immediately to the Mirage management.

Upon our return home I reported it to the CPK offices, who - unlike the CPK #10 floor manager - acted very quickly to try to rectify this experience.  We did receive apologies from The Mirage management as well as 2 \"be our guest\" cards from the CPK.  We appreciate the actions of the CPK offices and the Mirage, however it is very unlikely we will return to the CPK #10 located inside The Mirage."}
{"text":"Friendly bartender... If you choose to eat at an airport you are pretty much at the mercy of the pricing Gods, putting that aside here's my thoughts. I sat at the bar where Don came over introduced himself as her poured me my first beer. I ordered my usual BBQ Chicken Pizza which arrived in no time at all. I ordered another beer as I finished off my pizza. The pizza was as tasty as if I had ordered it in a storefront restaurant...... OK, back to the first sentence and the topic of the \"Pricing Gods\"......A BBQ Pizza and 2 beers $32.00, ouch."}
{"text":"I know, I know. I stopped at a place doing breakfast only because its in the airport. 
Ordered the Mediterranean omelette, tried to get Monterey Jack instead of mozzarella was told it would be ok, but didn't happen. It was kind of like getting pizza toppings in an omelette, which could be good. But it was only \"eh\". Coffee was also terrible. Sadly this still seems like the best non-Cinnabon option for breakfast in terminal d."}
{"text":"We had the New York Style pizza and it was fresh and tasty. Our waiter was very nice and service was great!"}
{"text":"Total disappointment, especially from The Mirage, which I value. 

Huge line, seeing that I only wanted take-out. I've only had CPK in New York and wanted a late night snack.

 A man with white side-burns took my order. Very rude. I know he had to keep walking in and out for orders but he ignored me so many times, doesn't know how to shed a smile. Maybe he should work in NYC. Then again, the people in the CPK NYC locations are nice. Too me all the way to the side to order and when I ordered, he quickly walked away from me before I could even finish my question on sitting down while waiting. Yes, I stood there like an idiot with hundreds of stares in the back. I'm Cher, baby.

Whatever, I just sat down and he handed me my check and gave me my change back without a \"thank you\"with just a box. 

Dude, where's my bag?"}
{"text":"Appreciate the lunch size pizza and salad or soup combo. Enjoyed my spinach and quinoa salad. Veggie pizza was just ok.

Really liked the ginger something spritzer. Sorry can't recall the name, but it was super tasty. Better be at $3.50!"}
{"text":"This CPK does not allow you to use any CPK coupons. I guess \"it's in the mirage\".. That was my answer from the horrible service from the waitress who I would call out but she did not introduce herself nor was she wearing a name tag. I'm also ticked off because I waited nearly 15min before I was asked \"are you ready?\" When I haven't even been handed a glass of water or ordered a drink yet. The restaurant was not busy., it was mid day- Monday. 
When I finally was able to order my food, I ordered the top rated bbq chicken pizza. From my understanding a top rated pizza should be outstanding, not a cold disappointment. My pizza was cold and looked like it was made with the chefs eye closed. How do you screw up pizza? On top of all of this I had never been to a CPK."}
{"text":"This location gets super busy for lunch.  Stay at home mom's galore with their giant strollers!  Even if it's really busy, you usually don't wait for longer than 10 minutes.  They also have bar seating, which is usually empty.  The service is hit or miss.  This is a common lunch spot for my coworkers and I so we go here a lot.  Sometimes the service is fast, and sometimes it's slower than watching paint dry.  

The food usually comes out in a reasonable time, so that's not what I'm talking about when I say slow.  What I mean is that the server will forget to refill your drinks, or will take forever to bring you your check, or take forever to bring you back your check to sign.  

The food overall is good.  I've never had anything here I didn't like, but it's not spectacular or anything.  It's a great little lunch spot and other than the occasional slow service, there are no complaints."}
{"text":"My phone was dying, I had a five hour delay in Las Vegas back to SLC. I had to choose between a miserable wait near the gate or what the universe summoned as an adventure around the airport to CPK, of all things. I took the latter. 

Airport food is terrible and overpriced no matter what angle you take, but as the stray for a couple hours, I just needed to have a few drinks and eat something decent. The dumpy rating didn't turn me away. I figured \"no surprises\" at a California Pizza Kitchen. I know what to expect, I've been plenty of times before. What was a near empty restaurant with mostly baby boomers rounded up by the bar, turned into something far better than what I was anticipating.

Felipe, my server was a cool dude! Cracking jokes, taking my order, asking where I was headed; it seemed as though everyone around me was having a nice time despite also facing long delays to their desired destination. This is the kind of server I wish was at every half-decent establishment in SLC. 

The service made up for the overpriced, yet very small [and classic] BBQ Chicken Pizza. I walked in and was informed whiskey was half-price. I mean, would you resist when having five more hours to go? Could I have changed my ticket to Fireball Land instead of Salt Lake Land? 

Jokes aside, I had a pleasant experience and the food was well-above decent! I even got my phone charged while everything was happenin'. Thanks Felipe for the food and drinks and reppin' CPK as every server ought to."}
{"text":"Pretty typical airport food experience: 

*Inflated prices
*Limited selection
*Indifferent, borderline rude staff
*Cramped, dirty seating area

It's not the same pizza as proper CPK restaurants - the crust is different. That said, the other nearby options aren't much better."}
{"text":"Not too bad. I had the tortilla soup, and my husband had a mushroom, sausage, and cheese pizza. The tortilla soup was traditional style, and was hearty. The pizza was gone, so assuming it was great. Always a line at this location, so if in a hurry eat at the bar."}
{"text":"I used to dine at CPK a lot many years ago due to my love for pizza and pasta.  However, with my healthier diet, I've stayed away from this chain for quite some time.  

Since I had arrived at the McCarran International Airport early and was hungry for some food, I decided to have lunch at CPK.  Usually this place is packed but being Sunday, the weekend right before Thanksgiving, it was pretty empty, which was great for me.  I was seated immediately, but it took some time for the waitress to come take my drink/lunch order.  The menu is definitely smaller compared to their non-airport locations.  I ordered the cranberry spring mix salad with chicken, and it was pretty good especially when I compare it to the other restaurant options that were available to me (cold, prepackaged sandwiches and salads).  

In terms of service, I was disappointed that it took so long to get my drink order (just a glass of water) and prepare a cold salad when the restaurant was pretty empty.  Luckily, I wasn't in a rush...

However, I must say that service at their non-airport locations are way better so don't let this location deter you from going to the others."}
{"text":"Sis and I popped into the Cali Pizza Kitchen because the Carnegie Deli - one of our favorite spots - has gone computerized and we just don't like that.

I'm a big fan of the frozen CPK pizzas, so thought the 'real thing' would be...  spectacular!

We chose the Spinach Artichoke thin crust pizza.  And it was exactly the same as out of the frozen section from the grocery store.  In fact, I'll bet their garbage out back is nothing but empty pizza boxes."}
{"text":"This is a typical CPK in the smaller part of the Fashion Show mall (http://www.yelp.com/biz/rXUBAFqrr00KvVEJ6aNURw?hrid=OYsZi4R_-xj0UuVtTe5vPg).  If you're looking for take-out, head to the left of the seater and find the door near the rear of the restaurant.  CPK offers unusual selections (like BBQed chicken pizza) and delicious soups and salads.

Vegan Report: Their vegetarian Smashed Pea and Barley soup is awesome.  I also love the Thai Linguini without chicken and the Thai Crunch Salad without chicken."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza I've ever eaten! Truly amazing! ! I tried the bbq chicken and the jerk chicken...both were excellent! ! Service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to see one of my favorite chains in LAS. 

ATMOSPHERE: 
Nice full service location in terminal 3.  It wasn't too busy at the time we were there for lunch.  The dining area is pretty spacious and roomy enough to accommodate your luggage though the tables are on the smallish side.

FOOD: 
California Cobb - Got it with their house ranch dressing which is really smooth and not too tangy.  Also opted for beets along with the usual egg, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, and chicken. 

SERVICE: 
Our female server was friendly and professional. 

OVERALL: 
Clean, good service, and on par with taste continuity."}
{"text":"The food is like any other at CPK but we had horrible service. After getting our drinks we twirled our fingers for 10 minutes before placing our food order, another 30 minutes before our bread and lunch arrived and yet another 10 minutes to get the check. Don't expect refills or anyone to check on you. We sat next to some famous hair stylist who has a salon at the same hotel and he got his ice tea really fast so I guess it depends on who you are even at CPK..."}
{"text":"CPK is a great restaurant, but this location is not the best. The waitress was not super friendly and our food took a while. I ordered the overpriced Hawaiian pizza. It was average, but the price was ridiculous especially for the size and quality of it. I finished all the slices, and was still not satisfied. I did like the big slices of pineapple and ham they included though. Overall just not the best CPK, I've had better."}
{"text":"We needed to be at a event (Big Smoke) and needed to eat something, but afraid of not being there on time so we drove there and had enough time to squeeze in a bite on property. 

We were given bread slices and butter while we waited. I've not gotten cold bread out of the fridge before. I wasn't a fan.

We split a Thai chicken pizza on a thin crust. I haven't had CPK since highschool and remembered liking this. It was decent enough flavor and the thin crust had good crisp texture, but I don't like how the bean sprouts weren't trimmed and weren't as fresh as they could be. 

A plus was when we said we were in a time crunch as we were working a event, our server did his best to help expedite it, like bring us our check while we were eating and such. 

For the sports fan the dining room overlooks their sports book and have a few TVs in there playing some games. 

If it wasn't for a event and time crunch I wouldn't have really dined here. With it being in a casino it's a chain restaurant at tourist prices so there are other spots I rather go for $20 pizza."}
{"text":"Good food. Great service. I go there every week for lunch and that 30 mins break make me happy"}
{"text":"It was just what you would expect from a California Pizza Kitchen - which I love.  Get the Thai Chicken. so tasty!"}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 55/100***

It has been over a year since we've visited CPK located inside the Mirage. I'm not a huge fan of this particular location because it's hectic most of the time and that almost guarantees a not so spectacular dining experience but we were in the area and pizza was on our minds.

I was pleasantly surprised when we got there at a little after 6 pm, the wait was only about 10 minutes even though the place was abuzz due to the NBA finals. We were seated right in the middle of all the action so excitement was in the air, I didn't even notice that it took them about 15 minutes to take our drink orders. My husband, not a huge basketball fan, decided to entertain himself by timing how long it would take the servers to refill our drinks or take the used appetizer plates although I wished he had done that after we placed our food order because that took at least 45 minutes and I would've wanted to know how long it took exactly. The servers noticed as he was doing it but it didn't really make a difference service wise lol.

For appetizer we ordered their Spinach artichoke dip ($13.50) the dip itself was very tasty but it was hard to bypass the chips which were soaked and glistening with oil. 

We got 3 kinds of pizza shared amongst 4 adults and 2 kids: 
-Thai chicken pizza with grilled chicken, peanut sauce and topped with bean sprouts on thin crust ($19+)
-White pizza with 4 kinds of cheeses, sautéed spinach and roasted garlic on hand tossed crust ($17+)
-Sicilian pizza with Italian sausage, Capicola ham, Salami also on thin crust ($18+)

I was looking forward to eating the butter cake with ice cream for dessert but by the time we finished we were stuffed. I wouldn't be opposed to eating here again because the food is actually tasty but it's not something I would seek out due to the location. Even with the $2-3 mark up because of the casino location, they do offer Vegas locals 20% off the entire bill."}
{"text":"great food and great manager and service too--my husband was in love with the salad dressing from his chinese chicken salad so the nice mang. gave him some to take home---we love to go there while shopping in this beautiful mall on the lv strip--"}
{"text":"Why did I come here? Maybe I was hungry. Maybe I made a hasty decision based on the lack of other attractive food choices at the Las Vegas airport,  but I completely regretted my overpriced, forgettable experience here. Terrible food AND service. 

Cobb Salad was smaller than other locations and was missing eggs and cheese even though the description on the menu included the ingredients. We were going to say something, but the waitress didn't come back for another 10 minutes so we just said \"forget it\" and ate it. The only thing good about the salad was the interesting, asymmetric bowl it came in. 

Pizzas were amateur and just whatever. We got the Hawaiian and Sicilian pizzas. Nothing special. I'm paying $13 for a small pizza that fits on a normal sized plate, with basically 1 piece of a bacon and 1 piece of pineapple per slice? You've got to be kidding me. 

You'd think service would be faster considering people have places to go, but no. We sat around for another 10 minutes waiting to pay the bill after they brought us the check and we finally just got up and brought it to them because we hit our boarding time. 

I would normally recommend another restaurant nearby, but there really aren't any decent options around. If you do eat here, just don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"I always have the Kung Pao Spaghetti here, and I feel like the quality of the food has dropped recently. The bread is bland (but then it's my fault for comparing all bread to that at Maggiano's), our Mac N Cheese bites were burnt the last two times, and my husband didn't really enjoy his Chipotle pizza. He felt it had too much going on. 

The dessert (soufflé) was good."}
{"text":"For the love of God would they please close this disaster of a restaurant and open up something like a Chick fil -A or even a McDonalds. A Waffle House would be an upgrade! Yeah, it's that bad. Most airport food options suck, but this place is at the top of my airport suck list!

Service that is as slow as a tree sloth. Really, don't bother unless you have at least an hour to kill before boarding time. The other week when I was waiting for my flight and had 45 minutes it still was not enough time to eat here, and I had taken a seat at the bar thinking it would be quicker. Um, nope! 

Even at the bar the service was slow, and I had to end up getting the bbq chicken salad I ordered to go so I could catch my flight. Good thing I looked in the bag because they gave me the wrong meal on top of that. I had to wave someone down to quickly give me the right meal and I ran to my gate barely making the plane. Ate on the plane and the salad was barely passable.

As far as a California Pizza Kitchen goes there is not that much healthy here to eat, and a salad is the closet thing on the menu. Seems pricey too. Along with the super slow service this is one to avoid!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband before our flight. No one came for the longest time to even see if we were ready to order or even needed something to drink. We had to call someone over to our table just to get service. When it cane time to order there were many drinks that they don't serve here like the lemonades and the teas. We kept throwing different drinks out there to see if they had them here and she kept saying no. I asked her twice what drinks did they have here and she just looked at me with a blank stare. There was an awkward silence as I waited for an answer so I just said I'll take a water. Idk what's up with this place but it's by far the worst California pizza kitchen I've been to."}
{"text":"I am not a big CPK fan but will definitely eat here again . Food was better than average and the service was great. Great spot to eat while your in the Mall."}
{"text":"Everything, from the arrival to the service, I had an impeccable experience at this location. One of my biggest pet peeves is a filled drink; the busser never let me drink go below half full. Our server, Sally, was also outstanding. She suggested some appetizers to get us started, was very friendly and quick with our lunch. Important, as we were in a lunch meeting.

The shashito peppers were the best I've ever had. And yes, it's not really rocket science, as long as you blister the skin. It was the quality of the peppers. These were so much meatier than an others I've ever had, which are all skin with little flesh. For my entrée, I enjoyed the chimichurri chicken. I don't think the portions were proportionate to the price; about 6oz for about $20. Fortunately, we also had the dumplings for another appetizer. All the food came out hot, was delicious and perfectly paced for our meal."}
{"text":"I came here when I was at Fashion Show mall and had a sudden craving for pizza. I did not want to go to the food court and eat Sbarro so I thought, why not CPK? Upon entering the service was very quick. They sat us and took our order right away. We decided to order the Korean BBQ tacos with sweet chili sauce, mushroom pizza, and the works pizza. 

Breakdown:

The Korean BBQ tacos were the highlight of the meal! The sweet chili sauce perfectly complemented the chunks of meat and greens. The sweet sauce would leave a little kick of spicy after every bite. 

The mushroom pizza was average. It satisfied my craving for pizza, but I was not wow-ed by it. Half way through the meal the cheese  wasn't as soft and  had a weird consistency. Half way through the meal I found myself wishing I had tried Grimaldi's next door. 

The works pizza definitely was a little bit of everything. It had so many colorful toppings that made it look very appetizing. I was not too big of a fan though, since I don't care for meat on my pizza (veggies all the way!).

The experience at California Pizza Kitchen was an okay one. Would I go back? Maybe, but probably not for a while."}
{"text":"Airports are not known for inventive, ground-breaking cuisine, however good food is slowly but surely becoming easier to find. 

Such was the case at CPK at the Charlotte airport.  The air conditioners were on high that day, and I was desperate to warm up with some soup. The menu boasted not one, but TWO vegetarian soups:  Sedona Tortilla, and Dakota Smashed Pea + Barley. Have never tasted either before, I was torn, but was shortly saved by the friendly lady at the register who swiftly scooped up samples of each, allowing me to make an educated decision. I chose the tortilla soup, and was handed a large bowl that was both flavor-filled and warm.

I would prefer to pay less than $8 for a bowl of soup, but in a freezing cold airport, CPK's Sedona Tortilla is a pretty good plan B."}
{"text":"$11 for panini and $4 for a small bottle of water. 
The tables are not clean. There are better places to eat near the B terminal."}
{"text":"There's a cliche saying, \"If you got nothin' to say, then don't say anything at all\". I have a tendency of being over dramatic on my reviews when I am dissatisfied with an establishment. It's too hard for me to just sit back and not say what's on my mind.  So, I'm going to throw that cliche down the toilet like the rest of my food I ate here at California Pizza Kitchen.

Facts: Miso Shrimp Salad - it was a mess. The combination of all the ingredients together did not compliment my pallet nor my stomach. Everything was mushy. My stomach couldn't hold the food down. Needless to say, I finally took Imodium to settle my stomach down. I literally was at the mercy of my toilet bowl all night on Monday. :/ 

Ingredients: Shredded Napa cabbage with fresh avocado, julienne cucumbers, daikon, edamame, carrots, red cabbage, green onions, cilantro, crispy rice noodles and crispy wontons tossed in a Miso dressing and topped with shrimp. Also available with chilled-grilled chicken instead of shrimp. 

If you're curiuos about the restaurant, great because the employees are very courteous and do their job well.  Just don't order the Miso Shrimp Salad.  Unless you want to sit by the toilet all night, go right ahead."}
{"text":"Vegan and delicious is not problem here! I sat at the bar on a busy Saturday night. The bartender was great in making sure my order was right and I was happy. I got a side of oil and balsamic to dip my pizza in since I'm not a big marinara fan."}
{"text":"Alex is great!  Had Margarita Pizza, Asparagus Arugura salad and Chicken Caesar Salad.  Good lunch."}
{"text":"This is probably my all around favorite restaurant!  Their Thai Crunch Salad with peanut sauce is the best salad I have ever had!  Lots of other great dishes, and I almost hardly ever get pizza there!"}
{"text":"There was a wait. The hostess took our name and said we would be next, and to have a seat. She then proceeded to seat two other couples that had arrived and checked in after us. We decided to eat at Grimaldis instead."}
{"text":"They said it wasn't going to be busy at lunch on Wednesday so wouldn't take our reservation for 11 and was very busy so we didn't get to sit together. Service was prompt and food was good. We all had good credit so we all needed separate checks which they didn't fuss over at all. I was pleased that they had a lite calorie menu."}
{"text":"If you are in need of a spot to dine at, located across from Bar Loui, this is a good spot, most of the time. From lettuce wraps to unique and traditional pizzas, it can be found for you!

Service and ambiance are average, a more modern version of your typical pizza shop. The garlic and chicken pizza is one to be reckon with though, don't be afraid to step outside of your comfort zone."}
{"text":"Be aware,  they have items on their menu that they don't have.  There menu is misleading.  Service is mediocre..."}
{"text":"Love when places offer gluten free options and this place had a plethora!   I went for the spicy chipotle chicken pizza.  It was so delicious & loaded wt chicken and habanero peppers.  The crust was flaky and perfectly cooked.  Hands down the most delish pizza I've had... I ate the whooooolllleee thang!"}
{"text":"I really wished I looked at the reviews before I dined here. There is nothing chopped in their signature bbq chicken chopped salad. It is basically a bag of southwest salad you find in the grocery store topped with bbq strips of chicken. And there are no knives - just a fork and napkin. Marjorie was very sweet and the service bumped up the score. Super fast! I loved that you can charge your phone at the table too. But if you're a CPK lover... don't expect the norm."}
{"text":"Wow! Meat lovers pizza was wonderful!  From the wonderful service to the delicious pizza, it was hands down wonderful. Reasonable prices, was open very late."}
{"text":"White pizza is the best. Service can be slow when they are busy."}
{"text":"I certainly don't come here for the pizzas - there are about 20 tastier pizzas in town off the top of my head. I come here for the incredible salads! They are a bit pricey, but you can get the full sized (2 meals in one), or knock a few bucks off for half - the perfect lunch.

They have such a fun creative array of options and toppings, like this one: 

Moroccan-spiced chicken breast with crisp Romaine lettuce, roasted butternut squash, Medjool dates, fresh avocado, toasted almonds, fresh beets, chopped egg, carrots, dried cranberries and red bell peppers. Tossed with our champagne vinaigrette. DELISH!

I typically get the Cobb these days (it's low carb) and they have one of the best Cobbs in town. The avocado is always fresh and it's always loaded with meat and cheesey goodness. 

Look past the mediocre pizzas and try a salad - you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Here again , really enjoy eating here, the food is great, and you can't ask for better service, had the works pizza and the cob salad we shared it and still brought some of the pizza home"}
{"text":"Went there this evening and had really good food and pretty good service. The citrus crush was amazing !! I enjoyed the sesame ginger chicken dumplings and guacamole as the appetizers. The pizzas we had were pepperoni and the California club pizzas which were extremely tasty!"}
{"text":"Oh California Pizza Kitchen...
Every 6 months when we're going to Fashion Show Mall I enthusiastically exclaim, \"CPK!\" 
And I truly cannot wait to eat at you...
But then once my pizza has arrived I remember why I make no effort to get down here more than every 6 months...
Your pizza is just not that good. (I'm so sorry, I had to say it!) And I feel badly saying it, really I do....because I like your salads, small plates and appetizers. And because the service here is good! Very friendly and welcoming, no matter how big or small my group. But with a name like \"California Pizza Kitchen\" I forget to just stick with the yummy salads and appetizers and I inevitably venture off into the pizza danger zone. Probably it's my fault...
I'm sorry California Pizza Kitchen. But I'm sure to be back again in 6 months with fully renewed enthusiasm. \"CPK!\" I will shout. And we'll laugh and laugh, you and I. Until then..."}
{"text":"Despite being tucked way in the far-away back of a mall on Las Vegas Blvd, this is a great CPK. I love CPK mostly, ironically, for its salads, although its pizzas are fine, but the salads are of great variety, always fresh, and always welcome. Moroccan-spiced chicken has long been a favorite. The avocado egg rolls are also a classic they do quite well. The menu here is the standard CPK the world over...but come here to put your feet up and get some VIP treatment after a long day or shopping or trekking the Strip. 

This particular CPK has a wonderful staff, in particular the assistant GM, Jamie, who went above and beyond to ensure a quality crew meal for my large party on our work break recently. We called ahead to have food ready for us since we were on a tight schedule and everything was served correctly and fresh. Jamie made fresh coffees and served our every miniscule whim and request, boxing leftovers up herself, running pitchers of water back and forth, and completely winning us over with the \"life-changing\" dessert: warm brown butter cake with vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream. AN ABSOLUTE MUST-ORDER!

The seating here is open to the mall (not in the food court) but comfortable and not exceedingly loud. Very clean.

Highly recommended. Thanks for a wonderful CPK experience."}
{"text":"I only had 90 minutes to eat, gamble and go to my gate.

CPK seemed to be a safe choice.  I was wrong..

Ordered Thai chicken pizza and coke.

Thai chicken pizza ($12.09): that was the worst pizza at CPK ever.  It seemed like they rushed making the pizza and it wasn't done.  The presentation was kinda messy and the flavor wasn't there.  The peanut sauce tasted odd.  The chicken tasted bland and chewy.

Coke ($3.09):  Was that coke or expensive brown H2O?

I got my food in less than 5 minutes.  They were fast but they didn't really put an effort into making the pizza.  I would send it back to the kitchen if I wasn't starving to death and rushing to go to my gate.

Worst CPK ever but my waiter and hostess are sweet.

1 star!!  I notice CPK quality is going down and I am sad to say that I am not a fan anymore..

CPK at Vegas airport is not yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"The food we had was delicious... Thai chicken salad, quinoa and spinach salad, dumplings... All fresh and tasty. But the best part was the amazing service! We are not easy customers. We order things on the side, water with no ice, lemons, lots of special requests. Everything was received with a smile, everything was delivered as requested. It was amazing!! Kudos to Jamie, the amazing manager and our server Rachael."}
{"text":"always good! delicious pizzas and pastas. not very quick service, but ok. Do not serve breakfast. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Was waiting for a noon poker tournament and decided to get a pizza. Sat at the bar and got a bottle of Fiji water and a Thai chicken pizza with no carrots and extra sauce. I guess you aren't allowed to take longer that a half hour there. I was still working on eating after then and ordered a coors light. The second time I was offered a box and declined it by the waitress, who had seemed nice, I guess she wanted me to leave. I'm checking my messages and waiting for my friend and before I know it I'm surrounded by yellow shirt security telling me I need to leave. This was completely unnecessary and unexpected. Earlier I had offed twice to go sit in the sports book and finish and was told I was ok. Then she had served me a beer I hadn't even touched yet. I have never been asked to leave anywhere in my life. So now I pay and tip 20% and get walked out of the casino and can't play in the tournament or visit my friend who is a guest there. The poker tournament the previous night I had a guy at the table talking trash about cutting off fingers and toes, but he's ok to stay. Maybe it was because I won that tournament and they didn't want me back? Maybe it was because I had talked about the union strike going on? Whatever it was I will never be back and let all my friends know not to go there."}
{"text":"Usually I really love California Pizza Kitchen, but this location really wasn't that great. The quality of food and service is much better at the Downtown Summerlin location. To start off, we ordered the buffalo cauliflower. This was okay, but definitely much better at the other location. I split the shrimp scampi zucchini pasta with my mom and it was a perfect size to split with someone. We ordered a socialite cosmo and it took 20 minutes to receive it which was really strange because the restaurant was not busy at all. Our waitress was so so nice, so that was definitely a plus. In the future, I would probably go somewhere else to eat in the mall because there are a lot of good options that are probably better than CPK. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"united gate d terminal...greetings from hostess and seated with menu...pondering over salad or pizza, and deciding to take a soda $3.89 and a mushroom, pepperoni and sausage personal pizza $16.49....not a long wait and pizza delivered...crispy bubbling crust and cooked fine...soda refilled when empty without even asking...staff looking busy, but going through the motions of serving customers...bar crowded and mostly people coming for drinks to watch sports...not a whole lot of restaurant choices when flight is delayed...roughly $26 for a pizza and soda..."}
{"text":"Ordered a roasted artichoke and spinach thin crust pizza for carry out last night. 

I expected a wait, but the pizza was piping hot and ready right as I walked in. Some places will slightly undercook the center of thin pizzas--- not CPK, it was cooked expertly, and the artichoke hearts, sautéed spinach and roasted garlic were all perfect. 

I recommend all CPKs for having predictably good food, but this location goes above and beyond. Great Job, Dana Park CPK!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever had i got there two hours before my flight and didn't even get to order!! The saddest part is I was seated right next to where they put in the orders and other staff didn't even ask if I was ready to order and to top it off they tried to seat me at a dirty table to start off .. The waitress didn't have a name tag that I could read so I can't name drop but this is truly the worst experience i ever had with California pizza which is sad because they actually have really good pizza."}
{"text":"Terrible service super slow and the people who sat next to us after us received their food before us their excuse is that they're a franchise so they're different"}
{"text":"They have a full bar. I enjoyed the margarita. It was refreshing and tasted great. 

The pizza was okay. I ordered the margarita pizza (I'm just now noticing the theme I had going yesterday lol). On the menu they said \"fresh mozzarella\" but it wasn't the Burrata cheese, just a regular mozzarella. 

The waiter was very nice.  His suggestion to get the margarita was perfect!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service -- happy the Mirage has this place inside the hotel. Always a winner and open late."}
{"text":"BBQ chicken salad was awful! Soggy lettuce, bad chicken, and gross BBQ sauce. Nothing about the salad was good. For $13 it was a big disappointment. BBQ chicken pizza was also not good. Service was fine."}
{"text":"As in other locations, this CPK has great food and good service. Additional points for a lovely location in Legacy Village!"}
{"text":"Our server was efficient and a very well earned tip, he offered to split checks 6 ways when we hadn't even for it and this was prior to meals being order, kudos! 

the food though was least memorable, the pesto such such was standard and although happy it made me full, but there was no wow factor. for $12.69 I was hoping for a bit more.

was here because friends planned it, I opt going only if I have to."}
{"text":"This place is great, if you are trying to grab a quick lunch that is tasty and won't break the bank. I try to eat healthy (most days), so when I forget to bring my meals I always go to CPK for their meals. I choose to get their kids meal which, for $5.99, include a good piece of grilled chicken, veggies, and a drink. Can't beat this offer!

I have tried their salads and pastas in the past, and they are solid."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Service was terrible!

The food was alright nothing too special. I have had pizza and salad and appetizers from here. Nothing has been mind blowing. 

Where I have a problem was our server. She was terrible. She gave attitude when I ordered a water only. I had my kid with me. this means I will tip you extra because kids are a hassle. She got 8% for a tip. She took 22 minutes from the time she gave us menus to the time she got our order! 22 minutes!  I asked if they put raw egg in the Caesar dressing. She said \"well of course they put raw egg in it.\"  It isn't well of course. I asked because it wasn't obvious. I then ordered an appetizer for my meal because I didn't want to wait another 20+ minutes for her to return. My meal was fine. Everyone else's meal was fine. The server asked me if I wanted to try a different drink besides water. When I'm more than halfway through my meal probably not. She was rude and hopefully I don't get her again.  Yes, I do remember her name but I don't want to put it on here. My meal was $11 plus tax so I gave her a dollar. Normally I would have given her at least $3.50, since my kid was there, but she didnt deserve the dollar I gave her."}
{"text":"If there are two things I will not pretend to know jack about, they are pizza and burgers. The only thing I will attest to is what my taste buds like. California Pizza Kitchen is one of those places that some find as an atrocity to the art, but I opt for a different opinion. 

It had been some time since I had visited a CPK, but after two years, I went there for dinner while on a trip to Disneyland. I had ordered the Moroccan chicken salad. It was so good, that I went back the next day, and have ordered it after coming back to Vegas. This salad is not your run of the mill greens, it is jammed pack with flavor and textures. Avocado, dates, roasted butternut squash, beets, carrots, dried cranberries, bell peppers, with a champagne vinaigrette dressing. With the blazon heatwave to come, I can see this being one of the dishes I will look forward to eating throughout summer.

I am disappointed that they removed my favorite pizza, the Peking duck with hoisin sauce, but they still have the Japanese eggplant with goat cheese.  

They offer the option to switch out the regular crust with a honey whole wheat. It is a little healthier, gives a natural sweetness, and balances out the saltiness of the goat cheese."}
{"text":"I love CPK and have even gone out of my way to visit.  I will not be going out of my way to visit this location.  It's located in Legacy Village and it's basically the McDonald's of the shopping center.  We went on a Saturday evening, the place was jammed packed with kids, kids, and more kids.  Noisy, loud, whiney kids.

Food is good, we shared the Singapore shrimp rolls appetizer.  Yummy shrimp, baby broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, noodles, bean sprouts, green onion and cilantro wrapped in rice paper. They were served chilled with a nice ginger sauce.  Dinner was my favorite, barbeque chicken pizza with fresh yummy pineapple.  Service was great, but really the noise detracted from the meal."}
{"text":"Typical CPK.

I'm surprised that none of the CPKs offer any sort of gluten-free option for the pizza. Never my choice to go here."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick lunch .
We took the veggie pizza and the Mediterranean salad 
And the mushroom pizza plus quinoa salad, everything was fresh and the crust was just right, prices are decent and the cucumber mint juice was fantastic and refreshing."}
{"text":"happy hour is 3p-5p and the line is so long because pizza is half off then . service is ok."}
{"text":"Of course every CPK is the same, they are a chain, but this has a limited menu being in the airport. kind of in a hurry to order before a flight so I just ordered the Hummus and Pita bread appetizer. Just this appetizer alone took over 25 minutes and so we asked for a To-go bag, even that took a very long time. Its not like we ordered a huge meal. I know there is not a lot to choose from at LAS airport, but truly not great service. Also, I've had better hummus from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Sure it's more expensive than other locations but thats a given considering its inside The Mirage Hotel and Casino. Service was pleasant. He checked on us just enough and we didnt feel rushed, bothered or like we had to wait. Ordered the wedge salad to share along with the chicken tequila fettuccini. SO GOOD. It was the perfect amount of food for two. Our server brought us extra plates making it easier to share as well. Overall a nice experience for a late afternoon service on a busy Saturday. Bonus is the sports book right next to this open CPK so you wont miss a moment while you eat if you've got money riding on some games!"}
{"text":"Walked out sat for 15 minutes and no one even acknowledged our existence after being seated. Thoroughly disappointed in as we heard good things about this place."}
{"text":"Took forever just to take our drink order! We sat for 5 mins before someone stopped by our table! And they quit serving Mtn Dew!!!"}
{"text":"I would have to say this restaurant is one of my favorite to grab lunch at. The pizza is the perfect size for me at least, and I can't even finish the whole thing (only half), but it is delicious! I always get the Wild Mushroom Pizza and it is the most amazing pizza I have ever had. If you are a mushroom fan, this is one of the meals that you have to try. Our waitress and waiters are always friendly and are on top of their game ! I do not think there is one thing I can say bad about this place! I love it!"}
{"text":"CPK in the Mirage is great.  Every seat in the house lets you people watch while the fools around you lose all their money in the slots and sports betting area.  I was familiar with the menu after visiting a few locations on the East Coast.  The prices however were a little more expensive but that is typical of Vegas.  I wound up getting the Chipotle Chicken Pizza which was delicious.  If you like a little kick to your food, definitely get it.  The service wasn't the greatest.  We had one person take our drink order, another take our food order, and a third bring out the food.  I never knew who my real waitress was until the check came."}
{"text":"Wow we had great service today!  We ordered roasted veggie salad add salmon for $4.50....this is by far the best salad on the menu!!! I had the half portion and it was really filling!!! The other half ordered the California club pizza and my sons had pepperoni pizza. We had a free small plate appetizer with a promo card we got a few months ago....we got the corn gauc and chips. No joke on \"small\" but for $4.15 it was decent.  Very pleased with the good and service. Weather may have been a factor because it was raining so no wait and it was in between lunch and dinner time...."}
{"text":"Terribly disorganized!!  I have never seen an airport restaurant so poorly run.  Waiters don't know who's covering which table and they are all overwhelmed.  Food?  Who cares, it's a nightmare trying to get an order placed and food to your table."}
{"text":"I mean it's chain style pizza, like Dominoes or Pizza Hut. Sure you can dress it up or make it sound or look fancy but at the end of the day, it's chain pizza.  And it's fine.  My friend and I shared a Greek Pizza here at like 2 am, service was good, food came out fast, we were able to SIT since our dogs were barking in our heels!  Pizza was good enough, I put Tabasco on it to spice it up a bit, bill was like $20."}
{"text":"OK not as good as last time, I knew it must've been a fluke!  This time we ordered the tapas baked focaccia to tide us over while we waited for our food. It was damn good. We ate them up and waited.  As we waited, our waitress offered free bread to the table next to us. Now this was my biggest gripe last time I was here, so we ordered something, only to find out they give bread away. FML.

I got the same pasta [low fat zucchini and shrimp scampi] I had last time, it wasn't nearly as good. Apparently, must've been different chefs?  Shrimp came with the tails on it....drives me nuts and the tails/shell was soggie/soft, gross.

Friend got a pizza and she ate it right up.

Took a long time, again. Was almost 1.5 hours before we got out of there, so it's not good for a work lunch if all you get is an hour.  Last time they had some pretty cool music, this time not so much."}
{"text":"We had a great lite lunch from the small plates menu including a fennel sausage and poblano thin crust, mac and cheese bites, and the sweet corn guacamole. Everything was well seasoned and well cooked. We had water and the bill came to only $17. Great patio and excellent service."}
{"text":"Went on an early Saturday evening and it was crowded (my friend's band was playing on the lawn), but we were seated within minutes, our orders were taken in a timely fashion and our food came up very quickly.  Ryan, our server, was new, but I wouldn't have known that had I not asked him a question to which he did not know the answer.  He did a tremendous job.

One strike - we ordered the white corn guacamole small plate, and the salsa that came out looked suspiciously unlike the picture on the menu.  It turned out that it was missing red peppers, and when we inquired about this we were informed that the restaurant had run out of red peppers for the day."}
{"text":"I tried to order... but they were \"closing soon\" as in they were still open, sat me down... and then could not serve because the kitchen was already closing down; while they were still open. 

And... woman at front was sweet.... woman inside was... not."}
{"text":"very tasty Italian deli sandwich and pizza. the service is 5 star. Avoid the Dakota smashed pea soup"}
{"text":"I see these locations all over. I drive by thinking: I went there a long time ago and it was good enough. I think it's been about 10 years. The time before that would have been about 10 years in between as well.

Landed here the other night. 

Decor looked the same. Menu: darned if I could tell if anything has ever changed.

Clean. Friendly but distracted staff. World Series on TV.

Thai chicken and BBQ chicken pizzas on hand-tossed crusts. Nice flavors. Reasonable quantities of proteins. Fair price. 

For dessert, nearby staff all chimed in at once and said that we had to have the butter cake. OK. Before I realized what had happened the server had cleverly up-sold the order to include the ice cream. I probably would have said yes no matter what. But, I didn't realize on the spot that was an up-charge.

So, here's the thing: if you read others of my reviews, I'm pretty consistent. I want dessert! I need to have it offered or I won't order it (because, \"do you want fries and a Coke with that should be automatic up-sell language for any server all the time). I am a card carrying choco-holic. I would have liked for a bit of a run down of the choices.

The butter cake isn't all that. OK. It's not bad. The ice cream was frost bitten with ice crystals in it. And, more importantly, the scoop, which looked huge, was only a 1/2 scoop. Buzz kill! After the server asked our opinion, to which I said \"it was alright,\" she said she hadn't heard that harsh a criticism of it ever. I explained it needed chocolate. She then said, \"oh, you should have ordered the chocolate souffle.\" Well, too late!

It's not that I won't come back. I probably will. But, it may be another 10 years."}
{"text":"Went here tonight to show a friend. I usually really enjoy cpk, but tonight was bit disappointing. I had to wait quite a while for a refill and our server never seems the be around. We had a lot of other( must have been expediters) people come by and didn't notice my drink was all ice. I would have said something but the cane and went so fast I didn't get the chance. And it wasn't busy at all. 12 people that were wait staff standing around and only 6 tables of people. 
Also, I realize pepperonis make pizza greasy, but my pizza was exceptionally greasy this time. It ended up drenching the back. Hopefully next time it will be a little better. I will try this location once more."}
{"text":"By far the worse food I ever had the displeasure of ordering and eating.  I think I should have just ordered the ice cubes and a napkin; those two items are the only things that even deserve a star on Yelp."}
{"text":"I came here for a school fundraiser and the host was so incredibly rude. He refused to seat us near the other teachers from our school (even though 3/4s of the restaurant was empty). The host yelled at me, and then had his manager come over and yell at me.  We ended up getting up and leaving because I don't appreciate being yelled at in a restaurant. 

We ended up eating at Grimaldi's Pizzeria a few stores down, where we were seated immediately and had great service."}
{"text":"Worst service of my life. Slow service. Wasn't busy at all. Got cold bread around the same time my pizza came out. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good pizza, just right size for 2. Had the thin crust Jamaican jerk. Hot and spicy and yummy"}
{"text":"Incredibly rude servers. The female manager is helpful and friendly. Mediocre dining experience. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Loved the service from the time I stepped in until the time I left. It was very busy being it a Saturday during the \"lunch rush\" but it was handled with great professionalism. I ordered the 5 cheese & tomato pizza! It was excellent!!"}
{"text":"The worst service. We saw our wait person a total of 3 times.  Once to take for our drink order.  Took 20min to get a glass of water. Once to take our meal order and once to bring our selections.  42min to get our food, I know, because I started timeing after 30. The food was only ok. and we had to ask for our check from the manager.  I would never go out of my way to go back to a CPK."}
{"text":"This place is located in legacy village! It does have a quite small patio but the inside is pretty good size. They have a little bar and dinning area. The service is always good here. The servers help out with any questions and are very generous and attentive. The pizza itself is really good to me. I love how fresh it comes out! I can't complain about this place! I LOve it!"}
{"text":"I ate here this past weekend. We had a group of about 7-8 people in front of us waiting to be seated. As expected, it took them a while to be seated since they had a fairly large party. My sis, bro, and I waited patiently behind this group for I'd say about 10 minutes and occasionally tried to get the attention of the hostess considering there were several tables available to accomodate at least 4 patrons. It appeared to us that the hostess was, for some unknown reason, trying to avoid us. Even a couple who ended up behind us in line, asked how long we had been waiting and if the hostess had taken our names. Fortunately, the head bartender happened to pass by and asked if we wanted to sit at the bar. I have to say, the food was great and his service was awesome.............Again, my only complaint was the wait and the hostess."}
{"text":"My food hasn't come yet but service and water sucks ass. My water has pink shit in it and our forks look dirty. I don't care how good the food is, it cannot bump up the rating due to bad service.

Update: The food came before I got to post this and it was bad. The bread for our sandwich was old and the pizza was dry, plain and hard-ish. 

I originally wrote this 4 days ago but forgot to post this. oops. Still one star. Oh yeah, did we mention that we received plastic cups instead of glass cups like everyone else? Are you afraid that 2 wild youngin's are going to break your beautiful 50 cent glass cups? (we're 21 but we do look damn young!) The water was so nasty that I ordered sprite, where my first one had sea monkeys in it! They gave me a 2nd sprite without me asking, and it didn't have sea monkeys in it so I was like WOW cool."}
{"text":"L'emplacement explique probablement le prix de la pizza, mais meme si elles sont bonnes, elles n'ont rien d'exceptionnel!
Le service était très sympa, peut-être parce que la serveuse avait les mêmes origines que mon épouse, ce qui crée immédiatement des liens!"}
{"text":"Mom and I had lunch here recently while shopping at the mall.  We got seated right away at a nice table looking out at the mall.  Our waiter was attentive and friendly.  He brought our drinks right away.

Mom had the pizza & soup lunch duo.  She had the pepperoni pizza and split pea soup.  She really enjoyed both items. I had the Harvest kale salad.  It had lots of yummy stuff on it - faro, cranberries, goat cheese, pear and sweet potato.  It was really tasty. 

They also served sourdough bread with a herb oil.  They were both tasty and hard to stay away from me.  The bread was fresh.  The herb oil was tasty, spicy at times.  Yum.

I think the restaurant was recently remodeled so there are more tables and open space.  Definitely a nice looking restaurant.  I am sure we will be back as we shop at the mall frequently."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight with a group of 6. Quinn our server was outstanding and made sure both my husband and I had great drinks and he kept the kids happy with endless chips and Parmesan for their pastas ! The menu has something for everyone. I am a big fan of fish tacos and theirs dos not disappoint. We always get the spinach artichoke dip for appetizers. Tonight they were spot on here !"}
{"text":"$5 shot wit a beer
That Cesar salad - have no fear 
Pepperoni pizza, the choice is clear 
CPK is the airport restaurant of the year 

?"}
{"text":"Waited for hostess to take a walk up order from airport employee. Made me wait to be seated while they chatted in Spanish, no offense just inconsiderate in my opinion."}
{"text":"I have never had a worse experience. This was disappointing and a down right disaster. They were super short staffed. Our waitress was maritiza or however you spell it. She was probably the rudest person alive. She gave everyone an attitude. She kept avoiding all her tables. She finally took our order, we asked her what's good and she said \"omg I don't have time\" we asked her for bread she said if I get to it. She got every single one of our orders wrong , even the drinks. Someone from our party came late, she asked for a menu and she replied \"look into know you just got here but I have other customers so you need to wait till I have time to even take your order \" she is seriously in the wrong industry. Not a people person at all. Rude!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This airport location was relatively quick. I had the slit pea/barley soup which was very tasty while I waited for my Thai chicken pizza to be prepared. They are very busy there, but should be fine if you're just doing takeout."}
{"text":"Service was phenomenal.  The kind of service you'd expect at a steakhouse. Our server,  mitch, gave us high quality attention and left our water glasses brimming full. I wish he could serve us at every restaurant! 

Food came out fast, which is what we needed to make our show ontime, and was tasty.  We had the chicken lettuce wraps to start and the Jamaican jerk pizza. Loved both! The quality of this location is above and beyond other cpks."}
{"text":"A limited CPK menu. Maybe half a dozen pizzas, including the BBQ chicken pizza that made CPK a household name. 

The cheese pizza was just as good as the one you get in a brick and mortar location 

Though the salad was prepackaged, it was almost as good as the restaurant salad. 

You grab your salad from the cooler, order your pizza at the counter, then go find a seat and wait for your number to be called. 

We lucked out and had a window seat and got to watch a plane come in, unload, and reload and head out again. Unbelievable how many people get involved in that."}
{"text":"Very good called ahead for a big group of friends. The staff was friendly and it was great good for good price as well!"}
{"text":"Blah.. Airport prices & taste like dominos cardboard pizza.."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with CPK if you are familiar with them. The pizzas are standard and the location is convenient.

The service was up to par for us, and the food came out fairly quickly. If you don't feel like spending a lot of money for food but still want to dine at a sit-down place, CPK will do the trick. It's casual but still conveniently situated by the casinos."}
{"text":"Our last stop in Vegas before checking out was cpk since we have one in LA, I know it would be a good bet. 
First off the spinach artichoke dip was good but chips weren't fresh, they were stale. I asked for bread since the chips were bad and the girl told me she would bring bread and chips so the new chips were great, a little greasy but crunchier. 
The bbq chicken is better than the one from LA 
Garlic cream fettuccini is the also good 
We also got free dessert for the chips mishap 

Without the service, I would've given 3 stars but because my waitress kept up with us consistently, 5 stars."}
{"text":"We went to this CPK because it is right across the street from the Mirage and we were trying to eat and get to the hotel in time to see the volcanoe eruption. Our server was awesome and got our order in right away and even told us the best way to get out of the parking garage. We ordered or usual BBQ Chicken Pizza and then saw the sign on the table for the Artichoke Parmesan Pizza and she was even kind enough to change the order once it had already been put in. The pizza was great and the Chinese Chicken salad is always good. We sat in the mall area outside the restaurant which kept our kids busy with so much to watch and look at. A chain restaurant, yes, but this was a good one at that...and we made it to the volcanoe just in time!"}
{"text":"The service from the kitchen was really fast! We only ordered salads, but I was still impressed with the speed the kitchen turned them out in. The salad menu is quite creative. I got the Moroccan Spiced Chicken Salad. It had a complex mix of items in it: butternut squash, dates, avocado, almonds, beets, red peppers, chopped egg and cranberries. I don't usually like beets, but they blended perfectly into this salad. The waitress was efficient and quickly took our order right after brining out our waters as she noticed our menus were closed. Another person brought out the food, but she was back to check on us about 5 minutes later. She cleared the dishes quickly too, but then disappeared so there was a brief wait for our checks. All in all though a nice place for a quick and light Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"The food was fine, I enjoyed the breakfast pizza. Service was awful, not that I expect airport restaurant service to be great, but at least bring the one or two things I ask for besides my meal. When I have to walk up to the bar for water and drink refills, you, server, are not doing your job. Also, Vegas food service in general is atrocious unless you are at a high end restaurant. Maybe it's not fair to compare an airport to the real world, but on this particular trip, all around bad."}
{"text":"We come here mainly for the Italian chopped salad and the Sicilian pizza.  Always have the same thing and are always happy."}
{"text":"came here on a friday night right before closing and they still accepted us. my boyfriend and i came here after clubbing at 1oak and we were craving pasta and salad!  it was his first time ever eating at CPK and we both loved it! this location is in the middle of the MIRAGE hotel and it is a open restaurant.

i ordered the jambalaya fettuccine and it was just a burst of flavors. the pasta had blackened chicken and shrimp, crawfish, andouille sausage and tasso ham in spicy cajun sauce! i love the spiciness of the sauce it brought the ingredients together! ( i am drooling while typing right now haha) the pasta was cooked perfect and the seafood was so good! it was nice that the meat to pasta ratio was fair. the crawfish and sausage was my favorite! i like the dip my bread with the extra sauce on the plate! i cant wait to order this again!

my boyfriend ordered the italian chopped salad and he finish the whole plate! we both thought the flavors worked well together. the salad had roasted turkey breast, julienned salami, garbanzo beans, tomatoes, mozzarella and basil tossed in mustard parmesan vinaigrette. the dressing was a bit sour but it had a nice taste to it with the turkey and salami. the salad was fresh and the ingredients went well with the awesome vinaigrette!

5 stars because service was wonderful! i wish i remembered his name but he constantly kept coming back refilling our waters as well as our bread! he never rushed us once even though they were about to close. in the end he boxed my left over jambalaya and ate it the next day before heading out to the pool parties the next day!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to get an afternoon pizza and walk through the Mirage ; ) 

We did half cheese half Hawaiian. So good as always : )  

Was pretty busy on a weekend afternoon. To drink I had the Mai Tai, it was good! It comes out of that automatic shaker machine as they do not have a full bar."}
{"text":"There are better options in the CLT airport but this is at least pizza if you're not looking for the S'Barro slices.

Prices are high but aligned with what most people would expect in an airport. The choices are limited, because they can't really have much for knives here. Staff are just punching clocks.

I had a barbecue chicken pizza and it was reasonably well-topped even if the crust was a little less flaky and a lot more boring.

If you like California Pizza Kitchen outside of airports, you'll be disappointed. If you like pizza in general, you'll be disappointed. But if you're just looking for an airport bite while you're connecting at CLT, you'll be okay."}
{"text":"The name may say California Pizza Kitchen, but the pizza is nothing like any CPK I've been to.  You can get better pizza our of the freezer section in your local grocery store.  If this place is really a CPK, it is an absolute disgrace to the rest of the chain."}
{"text":"The worst/weirdest experience ever! We went in to have the Mon-Thursday lunch special and were promptly told by the hostess that they weren't doing it this week. When asked why she said she didn't know. We ended up ordering the Sicilian to share, which literally showed up as a greasy monstrosity on our table five minutes later. I am positive it takes more than 5 minutes to cook and assemble a pizza, so it was either pre-made and reheated or we were given some table who walked outs pizza. Not even ten minutes into our meal our plates were taken away (before we even finished!!!!) and our check presented. No checking if we wanted refills on our drinks or if we were even done or satisfied with our meal. While we were asking each other what the heck just happened,  a couple were seated behind us and told by their server that they weren't doing the lunch special because \"we (the servers?) were sick of it, so we took it off the menu.\" The look on their faces were about as displeased as ours were. I don't know what's going on here, but the 20 minutes we were here were bizarre to say the least...."}
{"text":"They recently changed the menu for the worst.  We used to order the California club pizza and another one that I can't remember. They were both removed from the menu. Also, their drinking glasses were replaced with smaller ones which is very inconvenient since we were never offered a refill.  Something else to think about is parking we paid $7.00 for one hour.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Food was good enough. Service was terrible at this location. I had to wonder where they kept going. It was just terrible. Yikes."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast the Denver omelet was better than I expected and the server was great."}
{"text":"Worst Service on the Planet. Worst. Worst. Worst. Worst. Worst. 

I got in on a later flight and needed to get something quick before going out and I was staying at the Mirage. I gave the restaurant a call on my way to the hotel - they would not take a phone order, even with a Credit Card. Fail One. 

I got there, went to the hostess stand, she informed me that to order to go I had to go stand in another line by the bar - I go back there, get in line behind two other grouchy patrons and wait. When I'm finally greeted by a server, he is rude and not friendly. I ask if I can go up to my room to drop my luggage and come back and he again was rude. 

When I came back down my food was waiting in a paper sack. I could not have been more happy to GTFO of that place. The food was decent and the location convenient, but I repeat, the service was awful."}
{"text":"10 minutes before the server stopped at our table.  Another 10 minutes to get a cup of coffee.  Server never came back to check on us once we got our food.  Had to flag him down, waving our arms to get a coffee refill.  Understaffed. 
Applewood smoked bacon had NO flavor. Overall between the food and service...if I could rate a negative, I would."}
{"text":"This was no where like a CPK anywhere else.  Service slow.   Food marginal.   Not a great selection at airport so we tried.  Some sandwiches looked good.  We tried pizza and there were not many toppings and the crust bubbled up making it even more bread"}
{"text":"After several days of adventurous Vegas eating, I was craving something familiar and reasonably priced. So I thought CPK, can't go wrong with that. This location is inside the Mirage, in the middle of the casino.  It has an open floor plan, so you can see the casino from the entire restaurant. 

The service was great and the food did not disappoint. Our server was friendly, our food and drinks came promptly, and the salad I ordered was prepared well.  We even forgot a pair of sunglasses at our table, and when we returned to claim them, the hostess had kindly held them for us. 

But, it is just me or are the prices at this location remarkably higher than other locations??? A half salad that would normally be 10 bucks at other CPKs will run you at least $13 here. Their pizzas, normally around $13, are almost $20 here. WTF.  I know it's on the strip, but what a racket. 

Although I was satisfied with my meal, it seemed a bit ridiculous to have to pay more simply because it's on the strip.  So while familiar, I wouldn't necessarily say it's reasonably priced."}
{"text":"So disgusting. The host (who never greeted us) played with his hair for 20 minutes before helping the server  serve food-major yuck! ( and I'll be contacting The health department) The manager was more concerned with touching female servers than with anything to do with the restaurant...unless she was touching her buzzed head. This location has really gone downhill  and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Goose Island 312 welcomed me with open arms!!  Cold, refreshing and smooth.  The tortilla soup was good, hot (temperature), very flavorful, and had a good bit of corn.  Had the mushroom, pepperoni, and Italian sausage pizza.  The pepperoni slices were very large and packed a nice spice.  Mushrooms were scattered throughout meaning some of the slices of pizza had many mushrooms, while others did not.  The Italian sausage was good, very heavy in italian herbs.  Not a bad meal."}
{"text":"It's hard to mess up a salad, but CPK managed to do so. Chicken was awful, in fact I scraped it off to avoid eating it. Cold, tendons, and flavorless. My Bloody Mary contained very little alcohol (despite being a double). Only highlight was my hardworking waitress Michelle on 2/15. Airport food is better at Chili's."}
{"text":"just stopped by for a quick lunch, and I thought their arugula salad with quinoa and grilled chicken just hit the spot. Chicken was a little blackened, which was just perfect. Generous size even though it was half portion."}
{"text":"Tomato soup has too much cream but the pizza is delicious, a little heavy on the grease tho. Also, I wish this location had the trout, or maybe they took it out of all locations? Was pretty bummed when I didn't see it on the menu."}
{"text":"My $16 margarita pizza was the size of a dinner plate. I realize they are located in the airport but why should the quality and quantity be so terrible?  My pizza tasted like it was one of those cheap frozen pizzas. 

So disappointing!  I regularly visit the California pizza kitchen in Salt Lake City.   The Las Vegas airport location needs to provide the same quality we expect!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service in Vegas. Avoid it, food took way to long, when it did came out it was exceptionally lame. 

just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"CPK BABY!

Ok so I have been going to CPK for years back when I was living in los angeles, san fernando valley. A huge fan, the service is always good and the food is like no other. They are often immitated but never duplicated! A few of my faves are as follows:

{"text":"I'm only giving two stars because I received bread pretty quickly. I sat down and asked which sangria was the best and was told they're all good. I asked for the red berry.\" I was carded and ordered a pizza as well. I sat there as a bartender and the woman I ordered from went back and forth. My pizza arrived and I never received my drink so I asked for a box and the check and let the bartender know I never received my drink. They took care of my meal but I didn't feel very welcomed there."}
{"text":"Hmm Hmmm!!  Shared a very yummy lunch here with my Mommy.  The portions are excellent for sharing!  We had the Thai (something) salad and it was Gooooood along with the avocado rolls which were a tad different then what I was expecting but they were good.  My flavored tea was delicious!  I wanted dessert sooo bad but I was a good girl and passed on it.  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Ugh, mediocre food, OVERWHELMED waitstaff. It's an airport. Not going to find much else than this if you want a sit-down."}
{"text":"Tristan our server and Christina the MOD were just fantastic! Our food was so good and the service even better! Thanks for a great start to Mother's Day Weekend!"}
{"text":"Great food and AMAZING customer service, wish we lived near this location but we're in Los Angeles. Thank you for making our experience so pleasant. Special thanks to our waiter Markeith and the 2 managers on duty (Jamie and Kelli). All were exceptional."}
{"text":"I can say this CPK is my favorite one out of the ones I have been in LV, NY and NJ. 

They have remodeled  the interior, using a lot of reclaimed (looking) wood, I guess the Magnolia style décor is OK.

They changed some items on the menu, no more tiramisu we are not very happy about that! 

The service here is good 4/5
The food is really good Chicken picata, Fettuccine Alfredo, 4/5
Quinoa Arugula salad 3.5/5
The bar drinks 5/5
The strawberry shortcake 3.5/5
The chocolate lava cake (too bitter) 2.5/5

Our over all experience was good.
The location and parking is convenient,
So we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great woodfired pizza. I love the club and greek pizza.Rasberry mojito's are bomb too!"}
{"text":"1. Our Server Rob was absolutely fantastic. His command of both his job and the authoritative command he demonstrated was admirable. Even after a sarcastic and frustrated quip by me, he still kept his cool. Under no circumstance do I blame my server for what happened. He was doing his job. It was his manager that was flatly deplorable. I would very much appreciate my money back. The story follows below.

2. This visit, my last, has unequivocally turned me off to 'CPK' for the rest of my life. Under no circumstances would I ever consider visiting another 'CPK' again -- at any location. Sadly, my girlfriend used to like this place, now she despises it.

Upon ordering a poorly seasoned macaroni bite plate by my girlfriend, she asked our server for some marinera sauce to give it some more flavor to cut through the breaded and fried mess. He states that there was a $1.00 charge for the add on, and that the kitchen would \"saute\" some for us and he'd have it right up. Sitting at the bar, we watched as the open kitchen poured some from a plastic bag into the container, and then ladled an overly generous amount in to a dish. We then watched as one of the line cooks -- in full view -- put the dish into the microwave. The manager then served us the nuked tomato sauce and I politely, but succinctly, asked him why the sauce was put into the microwave, after we had been previously informed that the sauce would have been warmed in the pan. Yes, it tastes differently and would have been worth $1 had it been warmed in-house, and dare I say it I hoped would be made in-house, however it would have been fine if he just would have comped it -- even though admittedly I should have asked to comp the bites themselves. 

The problem came when the manager decided to respond in a flippant manner. Not only did he drop the ball on quickly fixing the problem but yelled at both me and my girlfriend telling us that \"all add-ons cost $1\" and that \"...if we'd like it in a pan he could have it made for us in a pan.\" I tired to reason with him as to why I was not going to pay for it. He continued to raise his voice, and rudely slammed the dish down when, exasperated, I asked him to just take it back. His sarcastic lack any sort of sophistication, his inability to rectify the situation, his disrespectful tone he took with my girlfriend -- a young woman whose job is to work with severely autistic girls as a teacher -- and the overall pathetic vibe I felt from the 'CPK' he managed ensures I'll, we'll, never return.

The salad was good though!"}
{"text":"The servers at this store absolutely made day. I felt welcomed the minute I walked through the door, they went out of their way to help me with my order, and the service was impeccable."}
{"text":"excellent garlic cream alfredo, had to come back the next night for it again, and their spinach asparagus spagehetini was good too.  their pizza is also decent and service was good. atmosphere nothing to write home about but thats ok."}
{"text":"Dont expect cheap price but the food is good enough , delicious pizza and cesar salade , lot of parmesan and fresh avocado. I like the decoration and the service was good for me."}
{"text":"Not bad for an airport location; but it's very rushed and the menu and food aren't what you'd expect from a typical CPK location."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find a California Pizza Kitchen at the airport! The menu is limited, but I didn't expect a full menu at an airport location. My partner and I shared a Chicken Tequila Fettuccine and a Cobb Salad. The food arrived in a very timely manner and was pretty good. The prices were similar to regular CPK's, but the portions were comparatively smaller and there was no Avocado in the Cobb Salad. We didn't have a problem with the service as our server was friendly and efficient. All things considered, I'm glad we ate some decent food before our flight!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is better! I appreciate the atsmophere and classy location.  I believe they have a happpy hour menu for food that inculdes drink. Prices werent overly daunting. i think i'll have to go back to give it another shot, Its worth a second try."}
{"text":"I've been living on the East coast for the last 4 years, and probably hadn't been to a CPK since I was in college....ooof, that's a long time ago!  But I do remember always loving CPK! So since I had some hours to kill while awaiting my flight at McCarran, I thought I'd revisit my roots!  

Boy, was I disappointed!  The service, while friendly, was SUPER SLOW (okay, I understand that there were like 5 tables and only 1 server, but still....the restaurant was pretty emptyyy).  But worse than that, the food was UBER BLAND!!! I ordered the Tequila Chicken Pasta, and it promised lime/jalepeno cream...ugh, it just tasted like nothing. Seriously, like nothing.

At least the view is nice (floor to ceiling windows overlooking the tarmac).  And there are power outlets along the wall."}
{"text":"Man, I really want to give this place five stars. No matter how hard I try, though, I just can't.

Why not?

Because the personal pizzas are *too* *darn* *small*! Oh sure, I could order a salad or something else to supplement, but then it starts getting expensive, and if I'm going to pay a lot, I might as well go someplace nicer!

Seriously...I LOVE the pizza here. If this place ever went the Cici's route and had a pizza buffet, I would go here eight days a week. There are so many varieties and I always agonize over which one to pick. While I never am disappointed by the pizza I pick, though, I wind up wishing I had ordered something else to supplement my meal.

C'mon, CPK, would it kill ya to throw in a salad or something with the price of the pizza?"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love CPK? This restaurant has been around since I was a kid. Unfortunately, there aren't too many locations here in Vegas. They really should consider opening a location away from the strip.

What I like about CPK is that they are always consistent. I walk in knowing that I will eat good food and leave happy. Here are some of my favorites:

-The original BBQ Chicken Pizza: gotta love this classic. Always comes out hot and delicious! 
-Spinach Artichoke Dip: I have ordered this dish at many restaurants, but CPK has the best one. Its very smooth, creamy, and easy to dip!
-Garlic Cream Fettuccine with Chicken: another classic that I love. The sauce is thick and full of flavor, which is how I like my pastas!
-California Club Sandwich: I ordered this a couple of times when I lived in California and I remember it being surprisingly good. I think the herb cheese focaccia bread was very tasty.
-Avocado Club Egg Rolls: I have never tried this, but my husband loves them.

One dish you might want to stay away from is the Crispy Mac N' Cheese. We ordered it when the new small plates menu came out. It sounded interesting because they use Panko, but it was very cold and the cheese was flavorless. 

Service has always been pretty good and attentive. Definitely one of the better dining options at the mall!"}
{"text":"My waitress was fine but pizza seemed like something out of the frozen food section at Walmart. I ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza, which i've had before at a regular (non-airport) CPK and the toppings looked a bit wilty and it just didn't taste like much. Not a bad experience overall but not near as good as a regular CPK."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Line to be seated but it went really quick. Had drinks and food quickly by very friendly wait staff. We were there for the lunch specials and my son and I had two different pizza/salad combos. Really really good. Not greasy, crispy crust and the Mediterranean salad was a perfect size compliment. I would eat here again. Great value also."}
{"text":"went here just to see if its not like the frozen hockey puck ... ( insert humor ) 

While yes they are good pizza's down from the sauce to ingredient's the yellow to go boxes toss me off a bit cause then I think about the store bought ones. 

Things to expect on thur - sat 

1.Wait times are busy its a oddly shaped restaurant so expect a wait
2. Price is a bit pricey for a pizza but I guess that's because it's inside a hotel.
3.Customer Service is the driving factor of this field and sometimes its a little lacking well 2 times I went. 


For a P.H. corp restaurant you would expect a little more friendly staff but meh 

There are other good pizza joint's on and off the strip 

oh and the customer attire various its funny to see highly dressed up people next to shorts and tee shirt people"}
{"text":"Rude services.  They also don't take CPK gift cards because they're not Corporately owned.  The restaurant manager walks around thinking he's the shit.  In reality, I hope he knows CPK is just an upscale fast food chain.  Food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I had a gift card to CPK that was burning a hole in my pocket so we headed here for lunch. I've always have good experiences at this particular location. Service is extremely friendly and efficient. This is usually my deciding factor in how I review chain restaurants typically. The food is usually pretty standard but the service is what makes or breaks it for me. This place has the good in the service area. 

The food, like I said, is pretty standard CPK faire. My favorites, and I usually stick to them when ordering, are the pear and gorgonzola pizza, bbq chicken salad and the veggie pizza. They have a small bites menu that I usually can't resist either. We went with the Korean tacos this time and they had a great punch of flavor and texture, so we'll be ordering those again next time we stop in. 

All in all, this location is great and extremely convenient when you're in Town Square."}
{"text":"We were hungry one night and staying at mirage and there weren't any fast food options inside the resort so we settled for this. We had a mushroom pizza with truffle oil ( HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) and a ceasar salad. Split between 3 girls, it was plenty of food and left us satisfied!"}
{"text":"Overall Satisfied with our dinner @ the airport CPK !!! We only waited 8 mins for the food to arrive!!! Chinese Chicken Salad was fresh and crispy ... the dressing was pretty delicious !!! The Thai Chicken Salad was warm and tasty !!! And the server was an older lady, she was nice and considerate !!! I guess less expectations, less disappointments really worked over here !!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here as we had a gift card and wanted to save a little while staying on the strip. Please note, they do NOT take gift cards (and it's our fault for not reading the fine print). Not the reason for the 2 star review, though... just want to give a fair warning in case you're thinking you can go here and save some $$

We were seated by a pleasant hostess and a few minutes later, a lady stopped by our table and asked if we had been helped. She proceeded to rudely and abruptly take our drink orders. Not more than 1 minute later the woman who was our server stopped in and asked for our drink orders. We told her that someone had already come by and she asked us to describe who. We tried, but then we were chastised for ordering drinks from the \"wrong\" person. \"Why would you order form her! She was not your waitress.\" Are you kidding? How were we supposed to know that...?? Both of these women need lessons on service/waitressing as neither had a good personality or friendly demeanor. THEN to top it all off, the lady who had just chastised us, came back a couple of minutes later and admitted that the first woman was her \"assistant.\" We noted throughout the night that the \"assistant\" came by ever so often to refill drinks. 

Water tastes like the tap water from the hotel sink (and I know this as I had to drink it from our hotel room a couple of nights...). My husband's Blue Moon was served in a small glass, same as the what the waters were served in. 

The reason for the extra star (2 vs 1) - pizza was actually pretty good. For ~$18 for what equates to a small pizza, it better be!! But in all honesty, good flavor and yummy crust. 

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. Many more authentic and better served restaurants along the strip!"}
{"text":"I really don't like coming to this chain. The food is soooo horribly bad that I don't understand how it's successful. The majority of my friends who I was with in Vegas  with apparently have no taste buds.

Appetizer:
Compared to the other entrees, the lettuce wraps were pretty good. However, as a standalone plate, it was nothing special. Anything will taste pretty bomb compared to the pizzas and pastas that I mentioned below.

Pastas:
I tried about 3 different pastas from our group and they were ALL sooo dang bland! You can make better pasta by heating up some Prego and boiling some noodles at home. Definitely NOT worth even considering them.

Pizzas:
The bread was crusty... Nothing can ruin a pizza like messed up bread when it's supposed to be freshly baked."}
