{"text":"Absolutely no hospitality here. Ordered street tacos and sat and waited and waited. The server checked on us three times and never told us that we were supposed to go to an area to get the tacos. The entertainer mentioned it and that's how we learned the program. Not only did the server not care either did the restaurant manager.  A resort restaurant, sad.  No hospitality here."}
{"text":"This is another great place onsite at the Westin Resort a Hotel. They have a big selection of IPA Beers! Multiple TV's great for watching sports, and tasty finger food. I like the old, dark, country decor. Reminds me of the 1800's western shows I used to watch. Service is always great. They have plenty of seats inside plus lots of outdoor seating. Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Waltz & Weiser Saloon is a great place to become inebriated while at the Westin Kierland Resort in Scottsdale.   I walked in here with about 150 other people and considering the mass demand for cocktails, the bartenders really kept up and provided excellent service throughout my visit. They have IPA on draft, which was awesome, and they pour relatively strong mixers considering this is a resort bar. A drunk golfer dropped and subsequently broke a tall glass full of Long Island Iced Tea and the staff cleaned it up in record time and even remade thew man's drink without batting an eye. Spot on service, really.  They also have a man that appears at sunset each night with a set of bagpipes and he plays a song or two to serenade the evenings arrival. This is either really cool or really annoying depending on your take on bagpipe music."}
{"text":"Food was great. Staff was superb.  Short menu, but the beers, tequila, and bourbon selection fit the line up perfectly."}
{"text":"Great pub to grab a drink...either inside or outside on the patio!  They have shuffleboard and a pool table next door."}
{"text":"Well from the looks of the reviews and the very selective menu, I'm unimpressed. This is the Westin for goodness sake! My boyfriend was extremely upset about them wanting to keep his card, so we closed out.   We ordered the chicken quesadilla (seemed like the safest choice) a Stella and an old fashioned. Normally, I use Blantants, but they didn't have it. Needless to say, we checked out an old/ new spot and we're definitely unimpressed once again. How sad. This was the busiest bar on a Friday afternoon at 4 in season at the Westin."}
{"text":"Great outdoor area to enjoy the view of the golf course and get some fresh air.   Was a guest at the Westin and thought it would be a great idea to get a drink before heading out for dinner. Not sure how the service is inside Waltz & Weiser but outside, it was not that great.   The servers were friendly but the drinks came out extremely late and the glasses were sticky as the drinks were made very sloppy (mine had mango puree all over the outside of my glass). Also, we asked for the check and it came out more than 10 minutes later.   I will most likely not order a drink from them again but will just utilize the sitting area for leisure."}
{"text":"Slowest. Food. Service. Ever.  This place is clean, quiet, and accommodating, but we were one of only two tables in the place and we could have gone back to the kitchen and cooked for ourselves in half the time it took to get our meals. And the fare wasn't exactly revolutionary. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Good service but one of the worst $15.00 burger on the planet. Just a bun and Patty. No lettuce, onions tomatoes or even a pickle for $15.00. Sorry Scottsdale visitors, this doesn't represent Scottsdale."}
{"text":"While the Westin digs are impressive and lunch at w&w on the patio offers inviting views of mountains and golfers coming in on 18, NOTE W&W takes POSSESSION of your credit card upon ordering (even without cocktails!) and retains possession until you are finished dining.   Who does this anymore?  To boot, service was extraordinarily slllllllooooooow, even though non-busy; all for a leisurely lunch, but c'mon!"}
{"text":"Excellent scratch Cadillac margarita, but it's the first place I've ever been where I was disappointed in the chips, salsa, and guacamole. The sunset bagpiper was nice and the ambiance was excellent."}
{"text":"What a fun place to hang out at the Westin Kierland.  Waltz & Weiser Saloon had something for everyone.  In our case it was drinks for the adults, shuffleboard and the rest of the resort for the kids and food for everyone.  Even billiards.  It's a little hard to find.  From the lobby you have to go through the lobby bar, down the stairs toward the golf course, then take a left just before you get outside and go almost to the end of the hallway.  Unlike the rest of the Westin, it's dark and cave-like.  A little more informal and comfortable.  Like the rest of the Westin, we had excellent service and pretty good food at premium resort prices in the upscale resort atmosphere.   Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a place to relax for a couple hours."}
{"text":"We always have a great experience when we come here. The drinks are okay, but it's best to switch up the recipe a bit if you're into darker cocktails. I'll give them 5 stars for the cheesecake shot I had. Yum."}
{"text":"Cool bar with late night food.  The burger with green chile is pretty delicious.  Grab a drink and sit by the fire outside or hopefully you will catch the bag pipes guy at sunset."}
