{"text":"DELICIOUS! Pollo Relleno was amazing. Recommend the pork stuffed pupusas for an appetizer. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place has some delicious but I mean delicious pupusas! Tried a a handful of places nearby but these are my favorite. This is why: 

1. They're cheap at just $1.50 each 
2. They're huge (compared to other local places) 
3. Curtido aka slaw that comes with pupusas is always fresh and plentiful
4. The pupusas are so meaty and full of cheese

At other local places I need at least 4 to fill me up, this place fills me up with just 2! 

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is the place is kinda empty and lacking some ambience. So although I love their pupusas I will most likely take them to go. 
If you're looking for authentic I encourage you to try this place. If  you're looking for a place to hang out, then maybe not here."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. 

We ended up here by accident. Apparently we were supposed to be at the place next door, but we'll call this a \"happy accident\". I liked everything I tried. I had a bit of papusa and it was great, so I ordered two to go. My own meal was the shrimp and rice. I don't know what made me order this, but I was quite pleased with my decision making skills. So good. Seriously. I'm trying to hurry with this review so I can go eat my leftovers.

Also, I'm not sure if it's because we intimidated the waitress or just out of good customer service, but a man, presumably the manager, came by to help with the order taking. He was pleasant, as was the waitress...the woman at the register could have smiled a bit more, but she was pleasant enough.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I fell love since day one. I'm actually on my way to try something new. I don't know how they do it but  their food have flavor and worth every penny"}
{"text":"Very solid spot off central avenue in the eastland area.  The steak burrito is very tasty. Comes with Guac and a cream dipping sauce.

I haven't tried it, but the seafood platter looked amazing...."}
{"text":"Me encanta la comida es rica y la atenci√≥n es fenomenal las chicas son atentas y eso me encanta les dijo algo la sopa de res esta de rechupete jejeje riquisima."}
{"text":"The ambience was much better than some of the other Latin American restaurants in the area... Their portions are humongous and everything is priced reasonably.. We tried their yuca fries with chicharones and papusas.. Yuca fries were excellent but we've had better chicharones and papusas - these lacked flavor.. The salad on the side was the best part in both these dishes!"}
