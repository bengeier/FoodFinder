{"text":"Although I haven't eaten here in many years I can say this is my favorite Chinese restaurant in they city.  The duck soup and chicken wings are amazing. It's an odd location, but try it if you haven't already done so."}
{"text":"This place had the most delicious Chinese food I've had in vegas~ Definitely coming back here again! Excellent service too."}
{"text":"Food taste like plastic! We were the only ones there. Never again! I recommend not going."}
{"text":"Love the place food, but  slow service, waited 20 min to take our order, place need remodeling , I come here once a awhile and service is never this slow , new server today ..over all food was good.."}
{"text":"OG Chinese in Vegas!!! Love their Pork Chop with Chef sauce."}
{"text":"I was absolutely shocked by their services. My parents went out for this Chinese restaurant in Vegas, hoping for a good meal. The food is so-so based on my parents' feedback (they just came from China to visit me), we ordered Bak Choy, ginger chicken and crispy pork ribs, which totaled to be around $32. The best thing happened at the end of the meal, we were given a hand-written note totaling our expenses, with 20% tip included. The total cost is 41.5 dollars. We were a bit confused and asked for a clarification, the waitress then said it was tip, 6.5 dollars! And walked away looking pissed and never did anything."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Pot stickers good, fried rice good, fried pork chops sooooo good ( a little salty) but really good, house chow mien very fresh and light tasting. Best part...this restaurant is connected to a bar you can go grab a beer after ordering and bring it back. sorry no pics we were hungry!"}
{"text":"Rude as fuck! My fiance called about ordering and we asked when they closed because we didn't want to be assholes and order 10 min before they closed. ANYWAY, she told us at 11 and he said oh, you close in a half hour? Her reply? \"Yup, thank you. Bye\" Um excuse me? What the fuck is that? Is that really how you run your business? Rude Asians with no manners and apparently no business knowledge."}
{"text":"\"Best Chinese in Vegas\" is probably a hyperbole, but not by far... This is great food for reasonable price and very friendly staff. Not surprised there where so many Chinese dining here..."}
{"text":"You can take off one star for lack of ambiance, but then add a star for a dinner of 10 with a final bill of $107, including tax. This is an old Vegas stand by. Really delicious potstickers, pan fried and little crisp and soft and the same time. I love anything in their Black Bean sauce. Good fried rice, and Kung Pao isn't too spicy, just right. My favorite thing is their Beef Chow Fun. I love this dish with little hot pepper slices and wide noodles. Off the beaten path, but not far for tourists. Also, they pour a good drink next door in Sonny's!"}
{"text":"my girlfriend and i really enjoy this place. it seems a little shady at first, but once you enter it is very pleasant. the place is usually empty when i go there, so the waitress is ready for our order asap. we always take out. last week we placed our order and walk into the bar that is attach to the Restaurant, and play a 20 dollar bill in the poker machine and what do you know my girl hit a royal flush. right as we cash out our food is brought to us. talk about perfect timing. we had good hot food and fat stacks in our pockets        oh yeah i always get the Mongolian beef, and she get chicken chomien best in town"}
{"text":"Authentic Cantonese style dishes without having to go to Chinatown. Food is good. My kids favorite is their salt and pepper pork chop and beef chow fun. It's not in the prettiest plaza but if the food is good that's all that matters!"}
{"text":"First of all I have to say that I LOVE Jacki - the male waiter/manager!!!  Super efficient, fast, funny and very attentive.     Diamond isn't fancy, its like being back in time 30 years - but OMG the food!!!  Egg Rolls are a MUST!!  Every dish we had was just superb!  Fabulous- tasty fresh food..  Can highly recommend the Orange Beef or Sweet and Sour Chicken  (omg was awesome!!)  Everything here is good.  Even the price!!!  100% the best Chinese Food in Vegas!!!  Make sure you check out the hallway to Sonny's Saloon - the pics on the wall of Vegas thru the 40's to current are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"We came in the mid afternoon, there wasn't much people here but all dim sum are gone. It was cheap to order half chicken for $14, but guess what,soup and boil veggie are $14 each as well.  Service was okay. Some time they help you to pack your left over, but they just bring us boxes. I would rather to eat at the other Chinese food places than this one."}
{"text":"We arrived in the late night and take the beef noodle. The beef is tender and in a great amount. But the noodle is not the usual one, it is a little hard. The service is good."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Diamond Chinese for YEARS! It's my favorite Chinese restaurant.   Don't let the odd location, shotty exterior, or the interior decor throw you because the food is GREAT! We never come here with less then 8 people. This is how it usually goes:   *Ring, Ring*  me: hello  Julie: hey we're going to Diamond Chinese wanna come  me: yep, what time.  *Ring, Ring*  Denise: hello  me: hey we're going to Diamond Chinese, you and the family in?  Denise: for sure, what time?   ...and so on. We sit at the big round table with the lazy susan and sometimes they have to add an extension onto that to accommodate us.   We order family style the same thing every time:   Singapore Noodles  Pork in Chef's Sauce  Beef Chow Mein  Sweet and Sour Chicken  String Beans in Garlic Sauce Orange Beef  Salty Spicy Squid  Combination Fried Rice   We order multiple times, no one ever goes hungry, and provided no one is drinking alcohol or sodas, we end up owing like $10.00 each. That includes the tip! It's amazing!!   We've never had an issue with service. Probably because they know us now :) This is a perfect spot for a pre-night on the town dinner, or as a cap to a day on the lake."}
{"text":"I remember when this place was in a rinky dink strip mall before Spring Mountain went over the I-15 Interstate. What a nightmare that was! It was good back then and it is still good to this day. Stay away from the regular stuff. You have to order the house specials and certain entree items. I would have to agree with one of the reviews that the quantity or amount of food has decreased over the years. Fortunately the quality has not degraded too much. Great restaurant and food with a bar next door."}
{"text":"I am a 2 1/2 star fan, but the bf states \"Hands down the best chinese food in town\" ... averaging it out to 4 stars total for the food lol.   If you are looking for quality of the food rather than the service, don't bother dining in! lol. I would highly recommend doing TAKE-OUT at Diamond Chinese because honestly, the customer service is not the greatest!!! But, we all know that great chinese food is always followed by poor service haha!   My top dishes:  Hot and sour soup - A perfect cure for a hangover or a chilly night in vegas.  Beef chow fun w/ black bean sauce - the sauce makes this dish consistent and flavorful.   Spicy pork chops - This dish is just a must have EVERY time you visit!  P.S.  I was a little skeptical because of how the restaurant looks (inside and out). No bueno. It is not fine dining for sure. You could wear pj's and its acceptable! lol."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here! The food is delicious and the service is even better. The sweet waiter remembers me and my family's order by memory. Not many people know about this place since it's not really easy to spot, but this place is the best. I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I *love* this place. It is definitely the best Chinese Food I have ever had. Many options, ranging from the exotic to more familiar favorites. Plenty of vegetarian choices.  Hot & Sour Soup - Full of vegetables and tofu, the sour mixed with the spiciness was a perfect way to warm up. It was so delicious I ate two cups even though I had more food coming.  Schezuan Scallops - Bay Scallops aren't my favorite type of scallops, but this dish was really good. It isn't garnished with lots of useless bits of uncooked broccoli like at other restaurants. This is a full plate of scallops.  Chicken Egg Foo Young - Hands down, the best egg foo young in town. The patties were generously sized and the gravy was to die for.  I also hear that their wonton soup is delicious.  Don't be alarmed by the exterior (Sonny's Saloon) and the neighborhood. The people in the saloon are nice (their drink prices are very reasonable). In fact, I kind of like the atmosphere.  Our waitress was a little grumpy, but I won't take stars off for that. The food more than made up for it and everyone has a bad day every once in a while."}
{"text":"Diner style, great menu, lots of variety.  Helpful waitress.  Food was great!  I nice break and just one block from the Strip!"}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of this place the first time we came by last year and was very excited to have found a deelish whole in the wall.  Since that first visit though they have managed to dissapoint me. The service is fairly quick but their food quality  has gone way done.   The first time I had their green beans they were savory, tender and sweet. Now they are bland at best and maybe even a little on the raw side. Their sweet and sour chicken is literally mush. Do not recommed.."}
{"text":"I was told this was the \"Best Chinese Food in Las Vegas\" .. I went to try after several referrals, I decided to try. The food was tasteless and slimy. Egg rolls had oil pouring out, orange chicken was slimy and had no taste.   Our waitress was very nice and accommodating service is not the issue its the food."}
{"text":"worst reason for food in gods world, avoid this, place, it was the place in the 80's now, the kids run the joint, its tastless, zero quality of any kind, service same shit, they think all orders to go, so they avoid hearing, food sucks goat balls"}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday based on yelp reviews.  Service was awful, so slow.  Food was not what we are accustomed to for Chinese.  Lunch took two hours and we left tons of food because it just was not good."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. Very unassuming hole in the wall. No frills just good food. The orange chicken is not prefrozen. The sauce though was straight out of a jar. Fast service. Low prices. More of a take out place but they have plenty of tables.  Make sure you look up at the ceiling. It's hard painted nothing I'd expect at a place like this."}
{"text":"Excellent place!! We love their Hong Kong style beef noodles and orange chicken we've been coming here for many years and recipes are still the same,  their prices are reasonable specially since they are so close to the strip and just behind the fashion show mall"}
{"text":"Sonny's/Diamond gets at least some props for living up to my senior citizen pal's description of the place as \"Half Chinese restaurant, half saloon.\" He'd been describing it as such for months and I figured it was just a bar that served Chinese food. Nooooooooo...the description was spot on. You walk into Sonny's, a \"saloon\" or bar in its own right, and at the back, there's a short passageway which leads into, wait for it, a Chinese restaurant. Yes, kinda like the KFC/Taco Bell one-two punch except not at all. Sonny/Diamond also gets a shout out for being on Industrial road, nestled between strip clubs and other shadiness. Las Vegas at its best/worst.  But the accolades stop there. I was amused by the scene of our waitress telling my eating companion exactly what we would be eating that night, which included spicy string beans, pork chops, orange beef, and spicy fried shrimp. The string beans were quite good, and the pork chops passable, but the orange beef was sludgy and sweeter than a pixie stick; the spicy shrimp dish was fine, just kinda forgettable. Not a terrible place to eat when you're intoxicated and jonesin' for some sodium, but there are so many other late-night spots in town that go toe-to-toe, why try one of them?"}
{"text":"How long has this place been here? Forever? Really? I never noticed it. Why? It's hidden.   This little diamond has been hiding behind the Fashion Show Mall and tucked away behind a bar for goodness knows how long! In all my years in Vegas this delicious place has been concealed from my palate! How dare everyone! Now that I have been clued in to this jewel of a place it has easily become my favorite chinese food place! Going to China Town on Spring Mountain is nice. The neighborhood looks nice, the shops are nice. The prices are ok. Sometimes the service and attitude is lacking from staff and servers. I rarely see smiles or any conversation there. It is very dry.   This place is not like that. The woman who served us each time we have gone there ( I presume she is an owner or related) is extremely hospitable and friendly. We have been lucky (I think) to have gone on times where it is not very busy. Maybe it is because it is a hidden place? Anyway, we have had plenty of great times here and have converted a few friends into coming here.   The food is tasty and the prices are so low! For the amount and quality of food I would easily pay 50% more elsewhere! We got checked up on often every time we were there and always had some to bring home with us. It is not the fanciest of places compared to nicer looking places on Spring Mountain, but the food and service easily blows those places away for me."}
{"text":"Just realized we were coming here since Janae was born 15 years ago. That's a lot of Chinese food....lol"}
{"text":"If you want an inexpensive, Chinese ( Chinatown like ) meal, this may be the place for you.  There is no ambiance but the amount of food they give you is huge - full of carb ( rice ).  There is little or no flavoring in all the dishes. The foods are not spoiled but freshness is not one their strong points.   Lunch specials are less than $5.95, a soup inclusive.  Most dinner entrees are less than $10.00.   One visit is more than enough. This is not a hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Come for the food.  It is authentic with good portions. Service was attentive stopping frequently.  Try the salt and pepper pork and your mouth will be happy."}
{"text":"I would give this 0 stars if possible. In my whole 34 years of life, I have never, EVER had anything remotely as bad as the stuff this place tried to pass off as food. I have attached pictures. First of all, my order wasn't even close to being accurate. Second of all, the food that I did get was ROCK HARD, like literally so hard it chipped my fucking tooth. If I threw a piece of this sweet and sour pork at the wall, it would make a hole. I am not joking, I am absolutely serious. Whomever made this food should have their food handler card instantly revoked. There was not one bit of care put into this. I am still in shock that they could actually put that in a box and send it to someone when they knew it was completely inedible. I am very offended that they would serve this to me, this is personal."}
{"text":"One of my friends from work introduced me to this random hole in the wall Chinese restaurant behind Fashion Show Mall, and I could not be happier! This is not a place to go to for ambiance. It is essentially attached to a dive bar, which can be accessed via a hallway that connects the two establishments. But it is definitely a diamond in the rough, no pun intended!  I highly recommend going with a group so you can try as many dishes as possible. My favorites include the Baked Pork Chops in Chef's Sauce (a must-try!), Spicy Salty Squid, Orange Beef, Singapore Noodles, and Pork Fried Rice. I have only tried their family-style dishes and cannot speak to their lunch specials, but I'm sure they are delicious as well.  Diamond Chinese does not have many frills, but what it lacks in ambiance it more than makes up for with delicious food, huge portions and very low prices. Once you find it, you'll visit again, I assure you!"}
{"text":"Nasty experience. Walked in around 1:30pm and the cook was wandering around an entirely empty dining room. Wanted to try the hot and sour soup. but you are NOT ALLOWED to order that for the lunch special. Instead, I received the worst version of Egg Drop ever. The soup tasted like a runny egg. The next issue weas the waiter, who spoke about 2% of English and was actually eating his lunch at the same time he was serving mine. He brought out my disgusting shrimp w/mixed vegetables and then went back to eating his meal. I felt like I was disturbing him if I needed something, but it didn't matter because I walked out soon after. The shrimp still had that nasty ring of fat on the outside which the lazy cook faled to remove and my one bite was tasteless and bland. PLace needs an overhaul - Mexican is a much better brand of food to be served hole-in-wall style."}
{"text":"Just ok at best no way all the rave reviews are people who have eaten there. Definitely a dive but not the amazing food kind of dive. The reviewers are from 1993.  Nice lady and nice service but prices for very mediocre food did not impress"}
{"text":"Next to the train tracks along Industrial Blvd, in a dumpy little building behind a bar, sits one of the best Chinese restaurants in Vegas: Diamond Chinese.  Almost everyone who finds the restaurant in its uninspired building is dubious that the place could be as good as advertised, but I swear Diamond Chinese doesn't disappoint.  I brought a huge group here and ordered 8 or 9 dishes off the menu.  Almost every dish they brought out was a winner.    We started with hot and soup soup and pot stickers.  The hot and sour soup is the best I've ever had.  Most Chinese restaurants focus on the sour flavor in this dish, but that's only half of the recipe.  A good hot and sour is supposed to mix sour and spicy.  The cooks at Diamond Chinese nailed it.  Fresh ingredients and the perfect balance of spice and sour.  The pot stickers (pan-cooked pork dumplings) were classic.  Not remarkable or unique, but everything that a dumpling should be -- seasoned pork and vegetable filing in a lightly crispened dumpling.  For main courses, we went with baked pork in chef's sauce and walnut shrimp based on the recommendations of Yelpers.  They were spot on.  The pork was crispy and tender and the chef's sauce was a great blend of sweet and spicy.  And the honey walnut shrimp?  Order it.  I am most definitely not a seafood guy.  Doesn't matter.  The shrimp is fresh and crispy and the sauce is spot-on sweet -- not overly sugary, not too creamy.  Just right.  The orange beef also deserves a huge thumbs up.  Best orange sauce I've ever tasted.  And the beef was crunchy and delicious.    Some of the other dishes were a bit disappointing.  I recommend that you stay away from the kung pao chicken.  It's a classic dish, but Diamond Chinese's version is surprisingly bland.  The chicken was tender and the vegetables fresh, but the sauce was . . . meh.  The lemon chicken was also uninspired, but I generally find all lemon chicken dishes to be dull.  The service was a mixed bag.  The waiter was friendly and made some good recommendations, but the kitchen was moving at a snail's pace when we were there for lunch.  Seems odd since so many other reviewers comment on the speed of service.    Bottom line: 5 stars for the greatness of the great dishes minus 1 star for the dishes that fell flat."}
{"text":"No one makes salted fish fried rice like this place does. Yummy in my tummy open till morning"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food and good portion size"}
{"text":"My family has been going to this place for over 20 years. SO GOOD! And the people who own this place are the absolute nicest. They already know our order right when we walk in! We got the wonton soup to start, then we always order the orange chicken (BEST I've ever had) beef chow fun with black bean sauce, and the pork chops in chef sauce. Seriously the best Chinese food I've ever had! It never disappoints."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm a good hole in the wall place! the house fried rice and the chicken chow mein are so good. prices are super reasonable and the atmosphere is nice yum yum!"}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall and in weird/sketchy area. This place is one of the most authentic chinese food I've ever had.  Hot and sour soup and lemon chicken are a must to get here during a cold winter night. The hot and sour soup is definitely a must prior to getting your main dish. The server will even serve the soup to you rather than you doing it yourself. The lemon chick is not the usual crumby breaded ones you get from other Chinese places. I don't know how to explain how they breaded it, but it ain't crumby.  A defo must stop if you're really hungry after a late night drinking."}
{"text":"I could not agree more with Adam C's review. The only cool thing about this place is that it doubles as a chinese-restaurant AND a saloon. There's a little corridor between the two.  Practically, it doesn't change anything though. It's really two separate places. If you have chinese food, you have it in the chinese restaurant. A very dark place, with no windows and little or no decorations. So much for the saloon atmosphere.  We went for lunch, and the place was relatively busy. There was only one waiter, a chinese man who couldn't muster English. He didn't look very busy, but it took him a full 5 minutes to acknowledge us and bring us the menus. Then, another full 10 minutes to come back.  We ordered two of the lunch specials: kung po chicken (pictured), and shrimp and vegetables. We asked for a soda, and water.   It took him about 5-6 minutes to come back with the soda and waters, and then another full 10 minutes to come back with the egg-drop soup. You'd think that if it's part of a lunch special and that everybody gets the same, they'd have it ready pretty quickly but no. Didn't taste like anything really.  Another full 15 minutes and we got our entrees. So much for a quick lunch meal! The kung po chicken one of the worst I've ever had. Heck, all the recipes I've tried at home were better. The sauce wasn't spicy at all, and it tastes like the brown sauce that you get on noodles, but not salty. The chicken was fine, but there were almost no vegetables. It was just a very very blend dish.  The shrimp and vegetables meal was average. We counted a total of 7 average-sized shrumps. There were plenty of vegetables in it, which was good. The sauce was a thick white sauce that was more or less flavorless. She ended up stealing my plate to get the sauce for her rice, because hers was even more blend than mine.  Once we were done, we tried to get the waiters attention as he hadn't even come back once to our table and we wanted the check. We had already been there for about an hour, but he was too busy clearing up the dishes and making lots of noise (the dishes were collected right by the entrance of the kitchen, in the dining area. Go figure why.).  In the end, we were very dissapointed. It was super close to our hotel, and we thought a small restaurant food where we could get cheap chinese food AND have a drink would be heaven. But the service was so sloppy, and the food was some of the most blend chinese food I've ever had.   We would never go back, but the place gets a second star just for offering a $4.75 lunch special a block off the strip."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in LV.  Come here every time I come to LV for the past 15 years.  Even back when they were in their old location on Spring Mountain.  Like everyone said, their Chef Special Baked Pork Chop is second to none.  Can't even find anyone as good as them even among the So Cal Chinese restaurants.  The lady waitress is the best.  Excellent service.  Made sure water are filled all the time without asking.  Hope the chef doesn't retire soon.  Cause we want to come here as long as we can."}
{"text":"We love coming here for their Baked Pork Chop and Spicy Salt. We also usually get one of the fried rice dishes with our meal. The only knock on the place is the location. Never had a bad experience and we always look forward to coming here to eat."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've ever had in my life. I don't understand the hype for this place. This place is below mediocre. My server couldn't get that I ordered a cup of water right. When she brought it to me the water was the same color as baby pee. I wouldn't recommend this place neither would I EVER go back. I ate a few pieces of the sweet and sour chicken and it was all bread it had no chicken inside."}
{"text":"Found this place while living in Henderson. They try to make you happy and that's the five star service rare with Chinese restaurants.   We ordered a veggie plate we thought we had last time we were ate here and it was totally a different dish. Our waitress saw that we pushed the plate away and offered to replace the dish with what we wanted. She even brought out the two types of vegetable (Chinese broccoli and Chinese spinach) so we could see the type we wanted... Really cool that she didn't give us any attitude. It made an impression on us :) we'll be back   We like the Pork Chop with Chefs sauce, Chinese broccoli with beef and Garlic, and Chinese spinach."}
{"text":"The food here is delish! Especially love the hot n sour soup and the sweet n sour fish. Literally a hole in the wall and would not have gone if it wasnt for yelp. Coming back for sure :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite and probably the best chinese restaurant in las vegas!  I've been coming here so much that the waiter and waitress know my order.  I can come in and they will run down my favorite items.  They also have recommended items to me that are not in the menu!  It never fails.  The Honey Walnut Shrimp is the best ever! Every time I go to different chinese restaurants no one has come close to their walnut shrimp.  I've been to 27 states and tried walnut shrimps in every state but no one has every topped this restaurants Honey Walnut Shrimp.  The service is phenominal! They treat you like family and during football season the chefs and waitress share their \"hot picks\"    I have recommended this restaurant to everyone I know.  Another big plus is that this place opens late.  They don't close till 2am!  So if you are ever craving some chinese this is the spot!"}
{"text":"I can't believe all the good reviews.  Food was horrible and the fish in the tanks were either dead or sick no in between.Vegas has so many great spots.  Don't waste your time hear.  This is the first time yelp steered me wrong."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall unassuming restaurant. Service was great the waiter was super attentive and never had a empty glass. The prices were reasonable for being so close to the strip.  We had the sweet and sour chicken and it was cooked perfect. The chicken was crisp and the sauce almost caramelized on the chicken. It was the best I've had in years. We also had broccoli beef and I loved the ginger sauce. The chicken chow fun was good but not as good and flavorful as the other dishes we had.  Definitely I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"We were in town, and the reviews were great!  What a disappointment.  The food had NO flavor.  My husband thought it was some of the nastiest food he had ever eaten.  He had to throw it up an hour later and we were back at the mall a little later in the evening to feed him. I didn't think it was overpriced until it was brought out to us.  The waitress, who was very nice, asked if she could give the leftovers to the homeless.  My husband didn't think they would even want it.  Bleah!!!"}
{"text":"April 14th 2010    This is seriously the best Chinese food I have had... no joke!  I came in with a group of friends (we have all been here numerous times prior and just can't seem to stay away).  Here's the scoop:  Ordered:  Pot Stickers (8)  $6.95  Spicy Salt Squid $8.25  Baked Pork Chop w/ Spicy Salt $8.25  Sweet & Sour Chicken $8.25  House Special Crispy Noodle $6.95  Shrimp Fried Rice $7.50  Ice water  Pros:   * Service is extremely fast (even when it's busy) & accurate w/ the order. * Generous portions and decently priced * Awesome Chinese food... I love it!  Cons: * My favorite dishes (see below) are missing from the Lunch Specials * There's a \"house special\" board in the restaurant, but I can't read it because it is written in Mandarin (or perhaps Cantonese...I'm not sure exactly which it is).  Tips: * We didn't order it this time, but definitely try the Baked Pork Chops with Chef Sauce... It is to die for!  A perfect combo of sweetness and crunch that I can't get enough of.  * Lunch Specials run from 11 am- 3 pm and only comes Steam Rice  * This place is a little hard to find, but look for Sonny's Saloon.  Diamond Chinese is connected.  * ask for their hot sauce.. mmmmmmm  *  Yes they cater!  Final Verdict:   This place is a must!  I'm a big fan of Chinese cuisine, but this place just stands out to me.  I haven't had a dish that I  didn't like from Diamond (not to mention the food is not overly oily like most of its' competitors).  My favorites and \"must haves\" include: the Houes Special Crispy Noodle (AMAZING!!!!), Baked Pork Chops w/ Chef Sauce (this sauce makes this dish!), and the Spicy Salt Squid.  Aside from the food, the service here is amazing as well.  The server always recognizes me (even if I have not gone in for months).  She always remembers that I'm a big fan of their hot sauce (which appears to be a homemade concoction of sorts mainly composed of Sriracha) and that I like to have hot tea.  Upon taking my order, she already has both in hand.  It's always nice when places remember their customers.  What can I say... I'm a fan!!"}
{"text":"I've gone here about 4 times already and every time the food is delicious and the service is quick.   You may be a little thrown off by the location. I probably wouldn't have ever noticed it if my boyfriend didn't point it out because it's pretty hidden in a ghetto looking plaza next to a bridge.   When you walk in you usually see the staff eating at a table because it's not that busy (at least the times that I've gone). You get to seat yourself and they bring you the menus along with water.   We usually order the pork in chef sauce and the crispy noodles because they are to die for! Then we'll try a couple dishes that we haven't tried before. The first time we went we got fried rice, but they give you complimentary white rice anyway so there's no need to order extra, just get another type of dish.   Every time we've gone the place has been very peaceful. I like that it hasn't ever been very busy, it makes for a nice quiet meal. Even though the staff is usually eating at one of the tables, they're still very attentive and fill your glasses whenever they get halfway.   This place has the best crispy noodles and pork I've had in town. I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"If you want great Chinese food, this is the place to go! Ambiance is lacking (which is why I give 4 stars instead of 5) but totally makes up for it with the food... Don't let the outside scare you.  Absolutely delicious! I've had sweet and sour chicken, chicken friend rice, orange beef, and chicken with black bean sauce and all have been the best I've ever had. My husband loves the Singapore noodle (and he's pretty particular about that dish). We come every time we're in Vegas. You really can't go wrong.... So give it a try!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese in town!  Nothing compares to it. I eat here at least once a week.  The food is uncomparable....I drive across town just to go to this place. Perfect 10!"}
{"text":"Ordered this food and it was disgusting. Ordered chicken Fu Yung with gravy and they didn't even cook the chicken in the egg Fu Yung the just put it in the thick salty gravy it was horrible. The portions were so small it was ridiculous and the Wor Wonton soup was the worst. The wontons were very slimy and just horriblely tasting  I threw the whole soup away. Never ever again."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim ..... at first a little turned off by the exterior and the faint smell of ciggerates from the saloon.. but do not fret....this place, truly is a hidden gem .. as alot of people have stated.. :) the house special fried rice was very tasty.... although lacking in amount of meat.... the chow mein was so good We ordered a second plate.. as well as the fried egg rolls!! Server was attentive and had suggestions...  here are pictures of the Kung Pao chicken And Shrimp Chow mein :).."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall place! No tricks or cheap gimmicks, just fine food all around. Those looking for  a taste as close to home, this is where you should go. Satisfaction guaranteed!!"}
{"text":"Ok...so I take back my comment about best Chinese restaurant in Vegas. It was until our last visit. They definitely changed chefs because nothing we ordered came out good or similar to what it's supposed to taste like. The Kung Pao Chicken was super bland yet sweet at the same time, the Sweet and Sour Pork was overly sweet but dry underneath the crust, the chow mein was bland, etc.  Our waitress was very nice. Chatted us up and was very helpful. Hence, the additional star."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best Chinese food bar none. My boyfriend took me there when we first started seeing each other and I was hesitant cause of location and exterior. Definitely don't judge a book by it's cover, this is my place now that I take family and friend's. They all agree and cannot wait to go there again when they come to visit. The fried pork in chef sauce in mouth watering. The honey walnut shrimp I crave and the Orange beef is delicious. Among many other dishes there, it'd a must try you will not regret it .."}
{"text":"this place was god awful, had sweet n sour chicken, and it was just WAY to sweet, the fried rice taste store bought, my brother had chicken curry which smelt exactly like chicken top ramen, my mom had chow fun that was LOADED with gravy, back east no one puts gravy on the noodle dishes and if they do its very light.  giving a 2 because the waitress was very nice but this place sucked, panda express will take my money before them."}
{"text":"We have heard about this place for YEARS but never went until now. It is true, the food was really good. This is an old hidden Chinese gem in Las Vegas. Nothing fancy about ANY of it but the food makes up for it. Its simple and the taste is good.   PROS: * Hong Kong style noodles with beef, chicken and bbq pork. The sauce was perfect and the noodles were crispy and didn't get too mushy from all from the gravy.   The baked pork chops were my FAVORITE thing on the menu. I don't know why they call them \"baked\" they seemed fried and they had this incredible salt and seasoning on them that made them incredible. They come in small pieces and very easy to eat.   Lemon Chicken was good. It was a fried chicken breast (breaded) and a HUGE side of lemon sauce. It was really good but I wouldn't order it again. Just because it wasn't mixed.   Great pictures of old Las Vegas in the hallway to Sonny's bar. Check them out if your there.   CONS: There was only ONE waitress working the entire restaurant so it took a minute for her to get to us. We were fine once the food came out though.   The inside of the place could use a \"facelift\" but the food makes up for it and I kind of liked the feeling of being in a hole in the wall.   We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Not a place for ambience nor privacy, but great authentic food! Not the typical Chinese Restaurant. This place is a must try when you're in Vegas and crave for Chinese food."}
{"text":"My favorite hole in the wall Chinese restaurant in vegas. Gotta have the spicy pork chops, I have tried to replicate this recipe, with little success. They can also do honey walnut shrimp, it is off menu, but they will do it for you. Super nice and courteous, always a stop for me when I visit."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've ever had, and I'm vegetarian.  Looks pretty awful outside, but decent inside and  don't worry, the food and service are very Chinese, and excellent!   A classic hole-in-the-wall find.  About $11-12 an entree.  Not cheap not pricey, a nice find.  Hidden behind Sonny's Saloon, a separate business.  5 stars for food, 3 for appearance and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been going here since 2005 when I first moved to Vegas.  Back then it could be considered a hidden gem, but I think by now most locals know of this place.  If you're looking for atmosphere then do not come, but if you're looking for great Chinese food then look no further.  Sizzling beef plate, Spicy chicken wings, Spicy salt pork chops, Walnut shrimp (not on menu, but served when requested) All great dishes.  Only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because there can sometimes be consistency issues with the food depending on who is the chef.  For the most part it's always good.  Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"That restaurant the food is very good because the chief is owner , he made a special sauce with any favors I like a chief sauce w pork chop n Singapore noodle n sizzling plate beef w blk pepper sauce n beef chow fun w blk bean sauce all the sauce made by owner .  yum me"}
{"text":"Staying in Vegas for 3 nights and wife wanted some Chinese food so I Yelped.  Found this place near the hotel with high ratings so off we went.  Ordered Sauteed vegetables and asked waitress what are the options of veggies under that category.  She gave us 4 and we picked Gai Lan.  Wife likes scallops and ordered a plate.  We asked for no MSG.  When the dishes showed up, the scallops plate is only the size of my palm.  Tiny amount, never seen anything like it before and I've been to many Chinese restaurants.  The vegetable dish was not much better either. So I had to order another dish or go hungry and decided to go for the popular pork chop with Chef's sauce.  I have to say that sauce was good but it was also the only thing good about the entire experience.   The meat was over fried, dry and hard.  We threw away about 1/3 or more of the meat as it was not fit for consumption.   In addition, first 2 dishes were full if MSG despite the waitress repeated our request.   I typically don't eat rice but end up eating 1.5 bowls to fill myself up. icing on the cake when I saw the bill.  Veggie price was higher than stated on menu.  I asked the waitress and she said the lower price wad for non Chinese fir whom they serve different veggies than what we asked for.  Remember, she gave us 4 choices and no mention of different price for different veggies for different ethnic groups.  Furthermore, she added 20% tip for herself for poor services.  Never came by to fill water or ask how the food was.    It was clear to us the waitress was spending much of her time at the other tables.  We were the only Asians in the restaurant and looks like despite a few high ratings from previous Asian customers, this place was not very Asian friendly, even charged us more for a dish. I highly DISCOURAGE anyone who wants authentic Chinese food with HONEST service from a Taiwanese/Chinese perspective to visit this restaurant.   My wife called this restaurant ????? for those who can understand."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in vegas!  We have been eating here for many years. We have tried other places and nothing even comes close. Their lunch specials are very good."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food on town.(hole in wall) not a place for atmosphere.. coolest part is occasionally  you hear and feel train!  Food is great. Always  fresh and comes out together!  Staff vwry friendly!  86 menu items anytime  thus place  hits the spot..CLOSED ON TUESDAY'S"}
{"text":"Keep in mind people come here for the Food NOT for the service!  That being said,  be prepared for a very tasty hole in the wall Chinese experience.  The taste of the food alone is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Nice hole in the wall Americanized Chinese restaurant. I had the peppered calamari as a starter and the Kung Pao Chicken."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've had since I left North Dakota.  Okay, I was going to build up to a grand conclusion, writing this beautiful prose and sharing my final analysis of Diamond Chinese Restaurant in an eloquently laced sentence filled with spirit and poetry. I had even written almost a full page of lead-up to this grand conclusion, when I suddenly realized that most people will never make it past my first paragraph (much less the sixth or seventh, I can't remember how many I had written) and therefore would never truly know how I feel. Anyway, that is why I made my feelings known up front.  We ordered the Pepper Beef and Kung Pao Spicy Chicken. Of course we assumed that by adding \"Spicy\" to the Kung Pao Chicken, they were trying to let us know that this dish must be really spicy, seeing that Kung Pao Chicken is already spicy. Both dishes were devoid of any flavor, let me repeat, Devoid Of Any Flavor what-so-ever. And this may come as a shock to you, but the Kung Pao \"Spicy\" Chicken was not the least bit spicy, not even close.   Only after depleting the container of Hot Pepper Oil was the chicken even remotely spicy, but it came at a terrible price - the Hot Pepper Oil added a strange flavor to the chicken dish and actually made it slightly putrid.  So now here's what worries me, how could so many people be this terribly wrong about a place? What happened? Unless someone can explain why this food was so bad, I may not give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"This place is great. Cantonese style chinese food. Really good. I just needed some vegetables in me and something that wasn't a gut bomb. After 4 days in Vegas you can start feeling a little lethargic from all the booze and fat and carbs, that you begin to crave a fresh salad or some simple chicken and vegetables.   The wonton soup was EXACTLY what I needed. I walked here easy from Treasure Island. It's kinda funny to find, you have to walk through the bar. It was seriously the coolest things ever. I think it goes something like this:  Two hungry tourists walk into a bar looking for Chinese food. The townies, and burnt out regulars hunched over their drinks hardly look at you as you walk around like a dizzy cheerleader \"like where do I go for the Chinese food?\"  Service was fast. Prices were cheap. Ambiance was nil. I would most pleasurably go back."}
{"text":"Great food, authentic, and a great hole in the wall. The service was really good. The server was friendly yet professional. Once you sat down they gave you a few minutes to figure out what you want to drink. Once you order the food comes out in a decent amount of time."}
{"text":"09.10.2017 @330pm   Looks can be deceiving!!!!  I remember going here as a kid. Going here now is worth it.   I came here with my wife and two fam friends. From the outside the looks can fool you.   We ordered egg drop soup, chow fun with gravy, ong choy, and  szechuan scallops.  Chow fun tastes like the one we had in New York and it was amazing! We've finally found a spot that serves good chow fun. I'm so glad we found it here.   The ong Choy was made with garlic it was simple and refreshing. A much needed veggie after binging all day.   Szechuan scallops, oh man. Spicy but not too much (just don't accidentally eat the pepper) it was done right. I can't explain it you'll have to try it for yourself.   Wife and my fam will be back for more to try the rest of the menu. I think everything tied it together when we heard the train pass through. We like it like that. It made it feel like home!"}
{"text":"Amazing hidden gem. Ready to get off the strip today and Chinese sounded good. We've been to some of the finest Chinese restaurants on the strip including Pearl and while that was good this was amazing. No frills. Just super good food. Order taken and written in Chinese. That's how authentic. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Everything from the service and food is good!! Don't let  the outside looks deceive you....the food was so authentic, you thought you was in some Chinese province eating fresh from the kitchen!! We had chow fun, omg Chou, and spicy szchaun scallops!! The price will not break your pocket and if your thirsty, theres a bar on the other side of the building! Enjoy and give it a go!!!"}
{"text":"I love Diamond China.  Their portions are a bit smaller than they used to be, but there's still a good amount of food to get me satisfied.  The food's still delicious.  Usually this place would get 5 stars, but service was a bit bad the last couple of times.  I'll bring it back to a 5 if they redeem themselves.  Anyways, the Hong Kong style chow mein noodles are awesome as are the Pork in chef's sauce, the vegetable dishes, the shrimp with that mayonnaise type of sauce, etc... The place is located next to a saloon kind of hidden across Fashion Show Mall.  It doesn't ever get packed when I'm there, and I hope it stays that way even with reviews from Yelp.  I love this place for some great Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool. The food was good but the lady was crazy!! I wanted to order this stir-fried dish and she kept recommending me other things. NO!! I just want what I ordered!! Not your stupid suggestions. Honestly, she kept pressuring me to order a drink. I don't want a drink. She probably asked me about 3 times. I have a giant bowl of soup! My friend ordered egg foo yung and she requested sauce on the side. It took awhile so we asked her. She says,\"Your juice is coming! Your juice is coming!\" WOW... juice? That sounds disgusting if you know what I mean hahhaa. Everything was good cept for the aggressive service from the lady."}
{"text":"Not my kind of Chinese food, all dishes over sauced.  Won ton soup broth thin on flavor."}
{"text":"This place was tough to find even with GPS.  We ordered a beef and cilantro soup, oyster and bean curd clay pot, beef clay pot, a seasonal vegetable dish and the beef with bitter mellon.  The fantastic flavors were truly unexpected.  Being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I'm no stranger to excellent Chinese food.  Since it was off the strip, the prices were reasonable. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow! Delicious authentic and under $10 Chinese food.  Except it's in quite possibly the seediest building and location EVER. It's walls are covered with \"Best of Vegas - Asian Restaurant\" awards which it's food deserved. Problem is it's in the middle of a saloon in a shady parking lot you know lots of blood has been spilled under a freeway overpass. Going in you think you're going to find 25 gangsters brandishing guns next to the bar. We came here on a recommendation of a friend for the best duck and rice for $10.  The food was seriously GREATNESS.  1/2 crispy duck - A huge serving of perfect fatless duck in a beautiful oyster sauce with duck sweet n sour. 5 star.  Salty squid calamari - perfectly battered and chewy. 4 stars.  Sizzling Beef - very good, tender meat with a thick Chinese gravy.  YOU SHOULD NEVER under any circumstance take a first date here. This is a place to go with friends you are comfortable with and just want to enjoy a great Chinese meal for $10-15 total each. Such good food, such horrible location and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Reviewing on the under $6 lunch special and some additional dishes ordered...they're a-ok in my book...  Diamond Chinese Service:  We were seated immediately for a lunch visit at noon.  The server brought us waters, menus and took our orders quickly.  The kitchen got all our dishes to the table within 20 minutes.  Diamond Chinese food:  I went with the beef with \"egg rice on rice\" lunch special.  It comes with a tasty but a tiny bowl of egg drop soup.  The dish came with choke (a lot of) rice and the egg topping and beef was flavorful.  They kind of skimped on the beef portions.  The rice/entree ratio on the tomato beef rice lunch special was nearly identical. The BBQ pork was dry and tasteless unfortunately.  The egg rolls weren't bad and larger than your typical egg rolls.  I sampled my friend's duck which was prepped well but bland in taste and smaller than your average duck dish.  Diamond Chinese Ambiance:  Vaulted ceilings with some Chinese decor makes for a simple but nice dining area.  There's a hallway that leads to Sonny's saloon which is so random yet so lowkey cool to me.    The lunch specials (11am to 3 pm, mon-fri)  under $6.00 is great value and makes for a quick and cheaper lunch option than the food court at the nearby Fashion show Mall. Overall, the food is better than panda express but falls pretty short of your typical decent Vegas Chinese restaurant.  The lunch specials will get me back and we'll try more dishes then but that's another Yelp tale, enjoy! =)"}
{"text":"Wow would have never thought!!! This little hole in the wall really came through... Love this place totally recommend it!!! Just try it, Love their service. Little man ran up and down the little room serving us.... Mmmmm Beef in black pepper sauce, shrimp fried rice, The spicy salty squid wow!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken and black bean sauce was really good.  The curry chicken was less impressive.  A decent little hole in the wall.  Service is average but friendly.  There are not a lot of people working there at least during lunch time.  The room is open with no music and you can hear all the other patrons conversations clearly.  I can't recommend it to most people.  As a dining experience it is below average and the food, while good for the price, is also not special.  I think that there are better Chinese restaurants in Vegas, but if none of those negatives sound like a deal breaker you should give it a shot.  I'll come back and try more things but for now it is a middle of the road lunch spot to me."}
{"text":"It's sooooo good! Hot and sour soup, beef and oyster sauce, fried noodle. Sooooooo good! The customer service is sooo awesome and price are reasonable! The restaurant located next to saloon and the entrance looks super shady but inside is clean and nice! The best Chinese restaurant I found in Vegas!!! U need to try this place!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese food place when I'm in Las Vegas, and since my boyfriend lives here that is quite frequently.  My boyfriend told me before coming here that it's a hole in the wall but he wasn't kidding.    Building is not visible from the street, the front says Sonny's Saloon and Diamond Chinese is located on the left back side of sonny's saloon.  Positive: You can order alcohol from Sonny Saloon 24/7 Quick delicious Chinese food made from a real Chinese man in the back Nice friendly service... 2 different nice Chinese ladies very sweet and attentive. Mapa tofu is good. beef with black bean curd sounds gross but is delicious garlic chicken yum   Negatives: SODA is out of a 2 liter!!!! I seen it! oh HAIL no!!! I'm a soda enthusiast and that is not cool Chicken is kind of suspect... even though I always order it I'm always curious of where the chicken came from.  lol Sometimes when the chef is different you don't know if it may be salty or the usual awesomness.    Remember this is a hole in the wall... but its good food.  I haven't tried many other places but thanks to good old trusty yelp, I just bookmarked up a storm.   I'll try those out soon and update for comparison."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and love it! It's a great \"old school\" Chinese restaurant. The egg rolls are probably the best we've ever had. The fried rice is tasty, but could definitely use some more meat in it. The chow menu is also really good. You should definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Very good food! We will come back here the next time we are in Vegas. Waiter was attentive and most of all restroom very clean.  It's a real hole in the wall and a must go to place."}
{"text":"An iconic Vegas hidden gem! I have been buying food here for about 15 years, always to-go, so I can't say much about service. On the other hand, food is great, and my returning here for so many years is a testament to it. My favorite dishes are Deep Fried Crispy Chicken, and Salt and Pepper Squid, usually accompanied by one of the house Fried Rices."}
{"text":"Not too bad!  We came here in 2011 for our reunion and first night in Vegas.  No complaints!  And thats from a group of my chinese high school classmates - we were celebrating our 50th birthdays.  Definitely not a bad place to go too. Its been such a long time, I even forgot what we ordered, but I do remember that the food was good and we had a good time.  All I can remember was that everything we ordered was good."}
{"text":"Food was great but the workers could be a little more friendly. Also we where going to order more crispy chicken and they said they where all out not to happy about that but it was great overall"}
{"text":"Diamond Chinese Restaurant is where the Las Vegas Strip meets Chinatown and local. In the shadow of Treasure Island and the Fashion Show at the crossroads of Sammy Davis Jr. Drive (formerly Industrial Road) and Mel Torme Drive (Spring Mountain Road exit) sits a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant attached to Sammy's Ballroom.      My experience visiting Diamond Chinese Restaurant was a cool experience. I will explain. It was a mid January weekday on the Las Vegas Strip when I was checking out the Chinese New Year decorations in the hotels. By the time I was walking through the Palazzo my appetite kicked. Whether it was the Chinese New Year decorations or not, I was in the mood for Chinese food. There was time to catch a lunch special at a locals Chinese restaurant. However, I didn't want to leave the Strip. Suddenly a mental book illuminated. It was for Diamond Chinese. Diamond Chinese Restaurant is the spot I remember that is across from the back of Fashion Show Mall offering off-Strip prices. A short walk would erase this mental bookmark. The short walk through Fashion Show and out the west exit of Dillard's delivered me in view of Diamond Chinese Restaurant. From the exit door I walked the southwest edge of the parking lot before crossing Sammy Davis Jr. Drive with the aid of a pedestrian signal.      When I walked inside this hall in the wall Chinese restaurant, it was walking into Old Las Vegas where I could picture Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, and Dean Martin taking a break from entertaining to enjoy Chinese food. The restaurant looked so aged that it is fitting that it sits at the crossroads of Sammy Davis Jr. and Mel Torme Drives. Complimenting the time warp vibe were the pictures on the walls. So much for the cool stuff. Now I will talk about hot stuff like food.      This place is unique because with a connection through the Fashion Show Mall, it is a Las Vegas Strip Chinese restaurant that charges similar prices to a locals Chinese restaurant. The perfect example is that my pepper beef lunch special with white rice and soup was $5.95. With a Coke added on it came to approximately $10, what I would pay off the Strip.      The uniqueness changed to ordinary by the time I was working on the pepper beef lunch special. I have dined in several Chinese restaurants in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Simply put this restaurant served me food that was decent yet nowhere in the top spectrum of Las Vegas Chinese restaurants that I have dined in. Additionally I was disappointed to see that only white rice came with the meal. This is a disadvantage when the majority of Chinese lunch specials include fried rice.      The service did not make me feel special like a Sammy Davis Jr., or Mel Torme. In my opinion the waitress was more engaged in talking to the chef outside the kitchen than following through with my meal or offering to top off my soda. At the same time, the service never disgusted me. In similar style to the food it was ordinary.     After leaving Diamond Chinese Restaurant with the distant Treasure Island tower in front of me and the row of Strip clubs to the left of me, when I was about to cross Sammy Davis Jr. Drive then head into the Fashion Show; it was with a fuller stomach and a decent impression of my lunch in the Diamond Chinese restaurant where the Las Vegas Strip meets Chinatown and the locals."}
{"text":"This is the dive restaurant of dive restaurants.  It's in a very out of the way place, attached to a saloon.  The menu was pretty extensive, and everything I got I enjoyed.  The preparations were better than you might expect from the location and decor, or lack thereof.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"Previously went to this restaurant with no problem. This time it was down right awful. Everything was fried to the point of not bring edible and they did not include white rice with the meals. Thanks goodness I ordered combination fried rice and egg rolls so we had something to eat. I learned I need to make sure I check my food before leaving especially if the place is 25+ minutes away from my house. Was a great place when leaving Fashion Show, hope it was just a bad night."}
{"text":"I came to eat at this restaurant because my friend said it was his favorite Chinese restaurant. He's a big white guy so I usually raise an eyebrow when he tells me how authentic a Chinese restaurant is. But hey, it was his treat so be it. Off we went to the hole in the wall next to Sonny's Saloon. A place where you are pretty sure there will be some brawlin' come night time since it's packed away near the seedy Industrial Road area, among the old machine shops, junkyards, and strip clubs of course.  The bar is, well it's like a bikers bar pretty much. Where the mustaches are higher and longer than the handlebars (we came at 3pm so I didn't see any bikers if they do come here in reality). However there's a separate entrance leading to the restaurant, so you don't need to run into any dude in chaps (riding a 2 legged horse with neier a bow leg in sight). We ordered his favorite, some sort of fish. Since I went to the Diamond China on Sahara and Valley View, I figured it's probably pretty good. No they don't even cook it the same. The fish is not steamed. It's more like lightly battered and cut into squares. It doesn't even look like a fish. The rest we had old standbys of sweet and sour pork, beef, etc. All in all, I told my friend I'll pick the authentic Chinese in the future, unless he's paying again, then we go wherever. Food is food in the end. Just don't bring your Asian friends here and tell them it's authentic. They may return the favor and take you to McDonalds when McRibs is back for authentic BBQ."}
{"text":"The reviews about the physical attributes are spot on. The 1st time I walked in I almost turned around and walked right back out. I only stayed because I was meeting other people there, who SWORE I would love the food. They were right. This is THE BEST authentic chinese food in the valley. If you're looking for sweet, americanized \"chinese\" food...don't go here. If you're looking for absolutely fresh, flavorful, authentic chinese food...you have to try it.  Hot & Sour Soup - amazing...I won't even eat it at other places now  Double salted squid - Wow! Makes traditional callamari boring.  Garlic Spinach - Do NOT expect American spinach. This tastes totally different, and totally mouthwatering  Pork Chops with Chef's Special Sauce - Zippedy doo dah :) Make sure you ask for extra sauce...you'll want to drown your rice in it, it's sooo good.  Actually, I don't think I've EVER had anything that wasn't absolutely fresh, hot, and delicious from this place.  As for the \"ambience\"? lol....it kind of grows on you. In the 10 years or so that I've been going there, I've dragged lots of reluctant 1st timers through the door....and have NEVER had to apologize after.  I only removed a star due to the ambience/location."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. The exterior is hidden by the more prominent Saloon, but there is ample parking off to the side and a direct entrance into the restaurant. There is a slight smell of cigarettes in the restaurant from the bar (although it is separate so must be a ventilation problem), but otherwise the service is decent and the food is great. I enjoy the fried rice and the sizzling pepper beef. Meat is tender and good quality. I've been at least 4 times and will return!"}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall spot but the food is very good..I'd compare it to Jasmine from Bellagio but minus the fancy setting..this place is a gem.  They still display their#1 Chinese ranking from 1993,but the food is still good."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas. They actually speak first and say hello and the food is always fresh. I just wish the curry in the chicken dish was thicker and rich instead of watered down. But overall it's a great little place to eat at."}
{"text":"We ordered carry out for lunch and maybe I would have given it more stars had we eaten in.  We had curry chicken, spicy bean curd, and sweet and sour chicken.  The curry chicken had a funky smell and in my opinion taste like they just dumped some of the canned yellow curry paste over the chicken and veggies. My husband enjoyed it so that is all that mattered.  My spicy bean curd had chunks of chicken/ pork in it! Not what I expected at all. The bean curd/ tofu was very soft and not seared or fried which was nice yet left it feeling mushy. The rice, I assume since it was closed in a styrofoam container was also mushy and over cooked.  My children's sweet and sour chicken was ok. Not drenched in sweetness. Again it was soggy because of sitting in The styrofoam container.  Will give this place another chance but next time will sit and taste the food without it sitting."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most delicious Chinese food we have had in LV ! Yes. As others have advised ( warned ) one is a bit taken aback by the location , surroundings & exterior of Diamond attached to Sonnys Saloon which appears to be attached to an adult shop / theatre... But the interior of Diamond - though lacking frills - is clean & pleasant .  And our server \"Joanne\" was delightful. My husband wanted to Have one of his favourite ( & unhealthiest ) chinese dishes ; sweet & sour chicken - to compare to other Chinese restaurants we patronize in NYC & in LA - He loved it !!! ( though the chicken seems to be heavily fried !)  We enjoyed the won ton soup.   Loved the sautéed string beans & the egg foo young ; divine . When Joanne noticed we hadn't eaten the egg rolls & asked why ... We said they were a bit \"greasy\".  She immediately removed them & removed the charge on our bill.  We will be returning to Diamond Chinese  Also a great spot for take away food if one happens to be shopping at Fashion Square !!!"}
{"text":"Chinatown really begins HERE! Cheap deliciousness in an unlikely location near strip joints, sex toy shops, and Fashion Show Mall with an uninspiring dining atmosphere. But, as everybody else raves, the food is A+--nothing on the regular menu tops 10 bucks-lunches struggle to break the $5 barrier. On a couple of yelpers recommendations we tried the baked pork with special sauce. Killer, super crispy and the \"sauce\" is a nice touch too. Is this stuff really baked? Seems more deep fried to me, I don't know how they could bake this stuff to such crunchy perfection. Regardless of how they do it, it's good stuff. We balanced it off with Mixed Vegetables Lo Hon Style, \"spicy please\". Waitress brings it out and the moment she set it down she says, oh, it's not spicy, I'll bring some hot sauce. At this point I'm kind of bummed, she sets a dish of some kind of chili sauce in a bit (not a lot) of oil. I'm thinking \"well this kind of blows\", UNTIL I tasted that stuff, complex layers of flavor. Use a little for a touch of heat and lots of flavor, add more for the burn you yearn. All of the sudden, I'm happy! That's right, a happy ending on Industrial Rd. Who would have thought? :-)"}
{"text":"This place has been my wife's family Vegas tradition for over 25 years, so I was just going to go along for the ride. Once inside you're created by a plain interior, and there's a poster of a restaurant review that says the place isn't fancy and you have no privacy but the food is worth it. I kept staring at that sign as we waited for the food. And it was worth it. Tip: order the 1/2 roasted duck right when you sit down because it takes 20 mins. Worth the wait! The skin is nice and crispy We asked if they had \"bitter melon\" (a vegetable), to which they said no but they would go out and get it. 20 mins later we had a piping hot dish of bitter melon and beef. The Kung pao beef was ok, not saucy and heavy like the Chinese places in Los Angeles.  Overall, I left feeling light and happy, not heavy and gross like other places. And I wasn't hungry an hour later either, but content all afternoon."}
{"text":"Valentine's day dinner.  Waitress was overwhelmed so service was very subpar.    Food was ok but nothing over normal.  Would come back only if I didn't have a car to go to China town."}
{"text":"*2.5 stars, but I'll round up*  Tried this place (despite it looking rather unsavory on the outside) a couple of days ago...  Plate sizes/portions aren't as big as I'm used to living next two big Chinatowns in the Bay Area, and the food itself seems uninspired and low-key.  Prices were on the high side at around $9 a plate which is high after considering the aforementioned factors, too...  I liked, however, that the inside was actually nicer looking than I'd expected from judging the exterior. Service was also satisfactory.  Other perks: Free parking in decent sized lot, restaurant is connected to a bar, and both are off the strip and low key / quiet. Also a decent menu selection.  Advisories: Unsure how safe the area is and if parking for long periods of time is completely risk free..  I'd eat here again but it definitely wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"2 words... HIDDEN GEM. This place is the epitome of the quote \"Don't judge a book by its cover\". It's literally right next to the building I work at, and, by judging the look of the restaurant, it doesn't look like one of those places where you'd think \"Hey, maybe I should give this place a try.\"... BUT DO IT!! I spent $9 and some change for a (much larger than I expected) order of chicken fried rice. It's definitely large enough to share and it's very delicious. I also tried my friends order of Spicy Salt Porkchops, which were also $9+ and equally as delicious. The order of porkchops were also large enough to share.   The decor is that of a typical family style Chinesse restaurant; large round tables, lazy susans, nothing out of the ordinary.  Try it out! I promise you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I don't go to Chinatown or Spring Mountain for Chinese Food here in Las Vegas. I only go to Diamond Chinese in Industrial. It's been there for years. It was good then, and it's still good now. It's a little hole in the wall, but isn't that always the best ones?...."}
{"text":"We only came to this place after seeing 4 stars on yelp. We want to give this restaurant a try. When we got to restaurant, parking lot was completely empty (bad sign!!) went in anyways... service was ok, but food was totally awful. We actually had to refuse some of the food. They have a poster saying \"best of Vegas\".. but if you look at the date .. it is from 1993.. guess the quality of food and customers have all gone away. We will not be coming back next time."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food and good value for lunch specials. Can say all the dishes I ate were delicious but the dinner portions are a little skimpy, lunch is a better value. Tried the sweet walnut shrimp, curry beef stew, mixed seafood, hot n sour soup, and the beef hot pot. All yummy."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall find.  Food was great for the right price and the server that helped us was funny and kind.  Spicy pork chop and chicken with baby broccoli is my fave"}
{"text":"I worked on Industrial Rd for years... someone told me of a Chinese Restaurant on Industrial, so I went looking... I drove up and down... nada.. Call for the GPS... found the location... no restaurant.. Out comes TOM-TOM GPS, never fails... right back to the first GPS... in front of broken down casio that looked like is was closed for years.. Maybe around back.. there was a HUGE sign that was visible from no where.. My Chinese wife and Chinese  brother  in law from Beijing went in... double take at the door... size of a postage stamp.. upon entering more , more room appeared into a cozy , but noisy eatery Ordered,... mind you , brother in law is a MASTER Chef in one of Beijing BEST restaurant, wife is a food critic for 3 Chinese magazines and a food blogger... so we eat a little Excellant Chinese food...  AND  THIS WAS EXCELLANT... everything was fab....service was good, and prices were very reasonable be back.... HELL YES!!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.  We are from Montana and get to Vegas once and sometimes twice a year. If we can't fit in Diamonds 2 times we really feel disappointed.   I also don't know what some of the reviewers were looking for. Even though we rarely get there, our waitress always remembers us. No, sometimes they aren't the fastest, but I don't see any advertising for \"fast food\". For those people that have enough time to nit pick and put a timer on waitress, please don't go back as that isn't the kind of atmosphere I'm looking for. The food never disappoints. Always fresh and hot. We also like alot of the favorites mentioned, especially salty spicy squid. We are going again in 3 weeks for a ZZ Top concert and I'm excited to try some of the mentioned dishes we haven't tried. Vegas has lots of famous chinese places, but this is authentic and great food. I just wish I could read that house special board."}
{"text":"Okay this Chinese dining establishment appears sketchy at first glance but don't let appearances fool you! My co-workers and I hit this place up for lunch and are so glad we did. When you walk in the atmosphere is really clean and well kept. They have great lunch specials ranging from $5.50-7.00 and the food is great! Asian fare that's authentic and really good. We had the shrimp and lobster sauce dish and beef curry. Can't beat the price and food quality. Give it a try and you shall see."}
{"text":"Difficult to find but this 'hole in the wall' restaurant serves some terrific dishes esp soups (bird nest soup, hot & sour), seasonal crab & lobster dishes, and 88 menu items all much cheaper and tastier than at high priced casinos. Quite a history here too!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese Dishes...   Friendly staff, quick service.  They have a full service adjacent bar, gaming available."}
{"text":"Talk about a Hidden Gem not far from the strip and close to the mall. When you see the outside you wonder how in the world could this place be any good especially attached to a Bar!  Once inside you would never know a bar was next door, it is always quiet there.  It is off the beaten path and it is on Industrial Road where you would not expect good Chinese Restaurant! It is a hole in the wall for sure with good food! We have been eating here for years. Always good!! Consistent too! I love the fried rice, Hot and Sour soup is the best in town! Hard to beat these 2 anywhere. As well as the Egg Foo Young!  No other Chinese restaurant comes close to how good theirs is! The spicy pork is amazing too! The flavors are amazing! The prices not bad either! Try this place for yourself because none of these bad reviews make any sense when this place has been so good for so long. I am not big on Chinese food but this place makes me crave their food it is so good!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Thought it might be questionable since it was empty at 1:30 on a Saturday, but after I realized it was just a well hidden gem!    The hot & sour soup didn't disappoint.  Just the right amount of heat and flavor.  Waitress was really nice and recommended the orange chicken instead of the sweet and sour chicken we were going to order.  She was right on.  Beef and broccoli was very good.  The broccoli was crispy fresh.  Pork fried rice looked a little greasy, but again, great flavor.  Fed family of 5 for $40+tip.  Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"The Hot and Sour soup is excellent!  We also had the Spicy Salted Squid which was slightly underdone but still the best I've had in this city.  Not a great location but the food and service were great, I will be going back."}
{"text":"As hungry as I was, I have to admit that this place did not do the trick.  Lots of goop in my chicken, the noodles were a bit too greasy, and the only saving grace was the fried rice...  sorry guys"}
{"text":"Best fried rice in town, my favorite place for Chinese, very friendly staff. Always delicious to eat here. House fried rice and Spicy pork chops are a must."}
{"text":"The best, and I mean, THE BEST AUTHENTIC CHINESE FOOD IN TOWN.  I've been going to Diamonds since I was a busboy at the Holiday Casino and it was located on Spring Mountain instead of Industrial.  The food is fantastic.  The service is great if their slow and good if their busy.   The soups are out of this world.  They are located in the back of Sonny Saloon and I hear that someday soon the owners may retire.  That will be a sad day for LV because this place doesn't have a near comparison when it comes to the greatness of it's dishes.  Baked Pork Shop with Chef's Sauce; Beef Chow Fun with Black Bean Sauce; Spicy Salt Squid; Hot and Sour Soup; Braised Snowfish; Walnut Shrimp; Chow Mein Hong Kong Style; .... All my family and friends go there and once I introduce someone new they are hooked too.  I'm not sure about some of these other reviews, maybe they were expecting Panda Express style kung pao and orange chicken.  This is real Chinese food.  They have to write the order in Chinese for the chef in the back!  Oh and they are open late so if you are hungry for good eatin' around midnight, stop on by!"}
