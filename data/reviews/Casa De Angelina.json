{"text":"Horrible service... Horrible service...Horrible service... I recommend you stay away from this place. Go spend your money at Macayo's if you want some mexican food. They will be out of business soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch here today and it was very good. We had tacos and tostado which was very tasty. Our waiter was very friendly and was telling us that all the food is made from scratch. No canned or frozen food. The salsa was very good, if you like a hot sauce that still has a good flavor ask for the fuego. It was too hot for me but my husband who enjoys hot liked it. We also shared the dulce de leche and it was absolutely wonderful.  We almost did not try this restaurant because of the other reviews.  I am glad we tried it out and we will be coming back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was featured in the Peoria-Glendale paper so we thought we would try it. As we walked in, we noticed the doormat said \"Casa de Angelina Spanish Food.\" Sound interesting? If there was any Spanish food on their menu, I sure didn't see it. We were a party of 5 - 2 ordered Taco salads, 1 Chimichanga and 2 taco plates. No Spanish food there. The food we got was just OK, not up to typical Mexican restaurant standards. On the other hand, the service tonight was great. But again, the food was nothing special. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The sign also bills itself as 'Santa Fe style' food. Having lived many years in New Mexico, with a family - generations of which are from New Mexico - the cuisine was decidely not New Mexican. It was standard Sonoran.

With that said, the meal was quite enjoyable. The enchilada sauce had a nice flavor. The dulce de leche was fantastic. The service was very good. The decor was a little non-descript, but that's OK, All in all, a nice addition to the meager choices for Mexican food in Surprise.  We would probably come back.

I had to give it 3-stars because of what it is not. If you are looking for Spanish food - there is none here. If you are looking for New Mexican style-cuisine, you won't find it either. 

However, if you are looking for a decent, enjoyable meal at a local family-owned establishment, this is a good choice."}
