{"text":"Casual dining place; you order at the counter and take your own food to tables nearby. BYOB with no additional fees. A curious mix of Brazilian empanadas and Korean style fried chicken, both of which were tasty and came out quickly. Both seem pretty authentic; especially the Korean style fried chicken which is very different than the American style (think much more flaky and less greasy) and worth a taste if you've never had the opportunity.   Only downside is the downside for everything in this area; parking is a bear to find. But won't hold that against Ki Pollo except it would be nice if their next store is somewhere with parking :)"}
{"text":"Good fried chicken. Empanadas were different than expected. Filling is good, various options but the empanada dough itself seemed more similar to Korean dumplings (mandu) than the denser, flakier dough I'm used to. House-made chimichurri comes with empanadas and was okay. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"I love Ki Ramen so I was super disappointed when I picked up take out from Ki Pollo tonight and everything was undercooked. The fried chicken was barely browned and the chicken was greasy. We ordered empanadas and they looked completely different from the pictures posted on social media. $32 dollars later we threw half of the chicken out for being greasy and undercooked. Super disappointing."}
{"text":"The best new spot in Lawrenceville. The chicken sandwich is amazing. The individual pieces of chicken in the meals are also massive. The chicken all comes from a local farm."}
{"text":"Glad to finally have been able to stop here for lunch, as I'm a sucker for fried chicken (fried anything really). I've had my fair share of korean fried chicken, primarily in NYC, and Ki Pollo is great, but not up to par with some of the best I've tried. It comes out smoking hot and nice and crispy, but just lacks a bit on flavor (which the sauces help as they were all delicious).  As far as the sides go, the kimchi and homemade pickled were both great. My wife enjoyed the chicken sandwich and so did I, but I wasn't a fan of the toast... would've preferred a roll or another bread option.  The bao that came with the four piece chicken was fantastic though, and probably my highlight of the meal. The staff was friendly and they have affordable prices, so I would definitely stop back when in the area, but just not for a special visit."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing!!! Highly recommend the shroom empanada. This is my fried chicken spot now!"}
{"text":"We eat here on Sunday and it was excellent! Killer empanadas and the fried chicken & smashed potatoes were amazing. Great service and very friendly atmosphere. Be sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"it was my first time over there and as soon as I stepped in I mentioned that to the cashier who takes orders from their customers. I ordered fried chicken sandwich (taste is good) and beef empanada which is I didn't have a chance to taste because I never got it! after we done with our meal I asked my money back for empanada he said it's ready but it was too late! if they are not able serve little piece of empanada on time I think there is nothing to say more! disappointed!"}
{"text":"The empanadas alone are enough to make me want to return. It's nice to have somewhere to get good empanadas since there isn't any around. The chicken was also good but the go to is the empanadas for me."}
{"text":"We ate at Ki Pollo on Saturday and had a good experience. Unfortunately they were out of the pumpkin empanada, chicken empanada and the pickles, but the other items we tried were yummy! Freshly fried chicken, shroom empanada, beef empanada, ham and cheese empanada, bao and kimchi. Lots of flavor in the empanadas and the chimi they were served with was very tasty. The bao and kimchi were full of flavor and delicious. The chicken wasn't really seasoned, but the breading is so crunchy and good and my guess is they want to showcase their homemade sauces with the chicken so don't season for that reason. I would definitely return. Really liked this spot."}
{"text":"The fried chicken sandwich was out of this world. Can't share much about the empanadas as the ones I wanted were sold out and had a long wait. The sauces on the chicken really made it out of this world, but the bread unfortunately could not stand up to even the first bite and we all made a mess"}
{"text":"While most restaurants are closed on Sunday, Ki Pollo remains open. The smell of fried chicken engulfs you the minute you walk in. I got the seitan and pollo empanada. The former was average however the chicken empanada was delightful. The scallion bun was pretty good, a tad oilier than I anticipated. I was pretty full at this point but I pushed through and got myself a fried chicken sandwich. 10/10 would recommend, the chicken was cripsy and the chili paste they spread on the bread was really tasty."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying I gave Ki Pollo 3 stars not because of the quality of food or service, but because I felt I had high expectations and it didn't live up.   Upon entry I found it to be bigger than expected. With so much space I thought they would have more options. They only have a handful of empanada options - Chicken, beef, mushroom, pumpkin and yesterday they had a special one with shrimp. The empanadas are a decent size. I advise ordering at lease two to make a meal. I also ordered a size of rice and beans. All in all it made a good size meal. Prices are reasonable for Lawrenceville. The best part is it's BYOB!   I can't say I'll be back. I don't think I'll find myself searching for a reason just because of the limited offerings over all."}
{"text":"Just wanted to get on here and thank Ki Pollo for the Braised Greens. Have had many bad orders of Greens in the Pittsburgh area. But yours were delicious. Great flavor, especially considering that they are completely vegetarian."}
{"text":"The food here just makes me happy. I've been down three times, with plans to go back again next week. The chicken is delicious. I've had two flavors of their wings, and both were great. The empanadas are dope too. Chill atmosphere. Not the quickest at getting the order to the table, but it's always been worth the wait once the food finally arrived. Bring a friend. Eat with your fingers. Leave happy."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but it didn't live up to my expectations. Ki Pollo offers fried chicken, empanadas, as well as some other extras. The day I visited they were also offering a kimchi soup.   I dropped by for lunch with a friend, and we ordered the combo and a fried chicken sandwich.   For the two empanadas which come with the combo, I chose to try the chicken and beef. They came to our table as we waited for our other food. The empanadas were piping hot, flavorful, and went well with the chimichurri sauce that they came with. I would recommend trying their empanadas out. They're super hot though so be careful with your fingers!  The combo was made up of 3 fried chicken pieces (drumstick, breast, and wing), and came with some cucumber slice pickles and a scallion bun. I also got to choose 2 sauces, so I picked the Gochujan and Tamarind BBQ ones. The fried chicken was hot and crunchy, and seemed fresh. It was fine, but I felt like it was lacking juiciness which was my main issue. I feel like if you have Pollo in your store's name, your pollo should be top notch. I didn't like the sauces. I usually really like gochujang things (I have some Korean brand gochujang in my fridge), but something about this sauce just tasted off to me. I wish it had more of a kick. The Tamarind BBQ was sweet and alright, but I didn't really think it went with the fried chicken that well. However, maybe I should have just chosen different sauces given that I don't usually like sweet sauces that much. The scallion bun was very fluffy and I liked that a lot. Pickles were also good.  The sandwich comes with the fried chicken breast with kimchi and the gochujang/tamarind bbq sauces between shokupan (Japanese toast). It's a sizeable sandwich that will fill you up, but my friend said he got tired of eating it near the end. In terms of flavor though, I feel like the components went together really well. My only gripe is that I felt like the shokupan should have been fluffier/a little more moist. I really like shokupan (also have that at my house), so I had some high expectations. Maybe the one we got was over-toasted.   Overall this place wouldn't be my top choice for fried chicken in Pittsburgh. However, if I was a little hungry in Lawrenceville I would pop in to try another empanada flavor."}
{"text":"Big fan of Ki Pollo  The chicken is always fresh out of the fried hot!   The cost of certain items is pretty good! The cost for extra sauce is pretty outrageous for what they give you but I can learn to use less sauce.   Pickles are great homestyle refrigerator pickles.  BYOB!  Empanadas were ok"}
{"text":"Okay, FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH!  That's where I suggest you start. It is FABULOUS!  It's on lightly toasted, thick, white bread, like Texas-toast style. It looks like it might make for a dry sammy, but no, it's perfectly toasted, leaving a bit of fresh-bread-moistness in there.   The fried chicken is great. Yes, it's tempura bartered, but it's lightly battered and it works great. There's a Korean-style BBQ sauce in there, along with a little kim chi.  Blended all together, it's is an AMAZING sandwich. (And I don't gush often!)  I also had a pollo empanada, and it's was nice. Wish I had a bit more of the green sauce that came with it though!  I'm not a big fan of the \"fast casual\" pay and tip up front, then sit down model. How do I know how much to tip up front?  Seems to be a big trend for the last 10 years or so, and a requirement for every new restaurant...  Anyway, this place has FLAVOR!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I heard the hype and figured I'd try it out. I order two different empanadas and some fried chicken. I must say the empanadas were good but I was not impressed by the fried chicken. The breading was too hard for my liking. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Really impressed with this place! Two of us shared two empanadas, two pieces of chicken (drumstick and breast), two bao, and pickles. This entire meal for two came to less than $15 and was perfectly filling. The chicken pieces are generous and the breading is delicious. I like that the chicken is sourced from a local Amish farm. We tried the chimichurri sauce (amazing) and the ginger soy (very tasty). At 4:30 on a Sunday it was pretty slow and well-stocked. I would have happily waited for such delicious cheap food. Looking forward to returning to this gem."}
{"text":"I was excited to finials checking this spot out and I'm so sad that I didn't came here earlier. I ordered 4 pieces chicken for me and my husband. It was prefect amount for lunch. It came with a side of pickled cucumber and a their version of \"bread\". The chicken was lightly coated and fried. When I bit it, it was so flavorful and juicy. I want say you can taste the freshness. Love the pickle as well. The place is decent size-wise but looks like most people chose to takeout. It is kinda serve yourself type of restaurant. All they do is to bring the dishes to you. They have lemon water, plastic silverware, napkins in the back of the room. Overall, it was 5 star positive experience and I would definitely coming back here even bring friends over. Ah, the price is so cheap, $11 for 4 pieces chicken! Even better!"}
{"text":"So there's quite a bit to say about this place, however, most if it is not positive. We decided to visit for lunch on a Saturday (11/25/17 at 12:30pm) and upon entering, we were the only people there.  We thought it was suspiciously empty, but we forged ahead nonetheless.  We ordered the 6 piece chicken (1 breast, 2 drumsticks, 2 wings, 1 thigh) and 2 beef empanadas for take-out.  Personally, I prefer white meat and was happy to have a breast included in the order.  We waited for about 15 minutes for our food and when we received the packaged to-go order, I was already concerned by how they put the order together.  They put the empanadas into one Chinese restaurant type take-out box.  They placed all 6 pieces of chicken into a slightly larger box of the same type.  The box with the chicken didn't close and it was placed into an open paper shopping bag with handles on the top and I was concerned the food would be cold by the time we got home.  When we began to eat the food, that is when the real concerns started.  As I was pulling the chicken out of the box, I realized we did not receive a breast.  Very disappointing considering we paid for a breast included in the 6 piece order.  The chicken was EXTREMELY greasy, had way too much batter on it and was fried so crispy that when you bit into a piece of chicken all you got was batter and the chicken just slid right out (kinda gross).  Being from South Florida, I was a bit excited to have an empanada.  Empanadas are their own food group down there.  The empanadas were very doughy (almost as though they weren't fried, but baked) a big faux pas for anyone who knows what a real empanada should taste like.  The filling consisted of ground beef, one large bit of olive and egg.  Again, this isn't empanada filling.  If you want to add olives to empanada filling, do so by chopping small pieces into it.  Don't just throw a whole olive into each one.  A bite consisting of only olive in an empanada isn't good.  And eggs don't belong in beef empanadas, but again, if you decide to put it in there, don't just have one big piece of egg white.  The food came with the choice of 3 sauces.  We chose chimichurri, tamarind BBQ, and ginger soy.  The chimichurri was kind of dry, while the other two sauces were good and reminiscent of standard Chinese take out sauces.  All in all, the whole experience was like having an A.D.D. lunch.  Fried chicken that was trying (but failing) to be Southern Fried Chicken, Latin Empanadas (that had a more pierogi like texture), with Chinese take-out sauces.  The meal also came with what appeared to be homemade sweet pickles.  Unfortunately, the pickles were the best thing about the meal for me, which doesn't bode well for the overall rating.  Pros: Pickles are good People are nice Service is prompt  Cons: WAY too much grease (they really need to drain their chicken before serving) Way too much batter Accuracy of order needs improvement Packaging to-go orders should be done better (closed containers are important) Their empanadas are NOT real empanadas  Are the restaurant owners even reading these reviews?  Pretty sure we won't be going back and by the looks of the place during a Saturday lunch rush, not many others are going back either."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch today and found it relatively quiet. I ordered a two piece combo, debating an empanada, but the filings of the day didn't entice me. So I sat and waited for the chicken to come out. It's a little bit, but you know they made it and it wasn't sitting there.   The drumstick, breast, scallion bun, and pickles arrive, with a side of sambal sauce. I was warned it was hot and that was an understatement. I started with the drumstick while the giant piece of chicken breast cooled. There is a good crunch, but nothing knocking me off. The chicken breast had a lot of grease running out of it. I ultimately dabbed it to get as much grease out and switched the drenched paper on the plate with a napkin. The sambal sauce was more nutty in flavor, so I wasn't sure if that was the right sauce. There isn't much given and I used it all before finishing my lunch. The scallion bun reminds me of a scallion steamed bao, but fried. Good flavor, but fried overload with the combo. The housemade pickles are good, less pickled flavor, so I enjoyed it.   There was still half of a very large piece of chicken left, so I had leftovers. Glad I didn't order an empanada as well.   Will I go back? Probably. I want to see how the wings compare. The fried chicken wasn't it for me, but it's fairly affordable and interesting concept."}
{"text":"Pollo empanada was too salty. Food and the place in general are not very impressive. Not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Definitely worth checking out! Beware the place is a little small and there is not a huge amount of seating, so I'd steer clear during busy hours until the excitement fades a little!  This fried chicken was incredible. Thick, crispy breading and a delicious mix of different sauce flavors to go with it. We ordered the 6 piece order to share between the two of us-- Chicken breast, 2 drumsticks, 2 whole wings, chicken thigh-- thinking we could take a few pieces home with us. But alas, there were no leftovers to be had! It was a huge amount of food but I guess we enjoyed it too much to stop. I tried the BBQ and Ginger Soy sauce which were both delicious. My fiance tried the gochujan sauce and loved it-- I stayed away from this one since it was very spicy. We also tried the Shroom and Beef empanadas and I enjoyed both of them.   The staff was friendly and the food was delicious, so I can't wait to give it another try!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the empanadas & took home a few xtra to share! But fried chix was just ok- crispy, but not much flavor. Next time, maybe I'll try the fried chix sandwich instead."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was surprisingly good. However, the empanadas needed help. The dough was undercooked and a little gummy. Empanades should be lightly browned and flaky!  Ground beef, olives, and egg is a pretty standard filling for Argentinian empanadas (which sometimes include raisins; they are omitted at Ki Pollo). Ki's lacked spice unfortunately, which is probably why the fresh chimichurri is offered as a side to mask the lack of flavor."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken in Pittsburgh, no, the whole country, hands down, no contest.  The batter is crisp and not greasy at all (with a bit of a Korean fried chicken style), and every piece was cooked to perfection.  Seriously, this was by far the juiciest and most tender fried chicken breast I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth.  The steamed then fried scallion roll that came with the chicken was out of this world as well."}
{"text":"It's their opening weekend so hopefully they work the kinks out over time, but I was super disappointed in this place. I love Korean fried chicken and empanadas, both of which are sorely missing from the Pittsburgh food scene, but Ki Pollo isn't doing them justice right now.   We went on the afternoon of Saturday 11/4 and they were out of two of the empanadas. I got the shroom empanada and a two-piece chicken - they were also out of drumsticks, so I got a breast and a wing.   When we got my chicken, all we got was chicken and sauce, despite the menu promising bao and pickles. When we asked the runner about it, she said they were out of bao and offered to get us some pickles, which we declined.   I'm hopeful that the pickles and bao would add some flavor to this chicken, because I was wholly unimpressed with it on its own. It's fried in a tempura-like batter that has absolutely no seasoning and just tastes like grease. Right under the breading was a layer of floury sludge that barely kept it in place. The chicken was very juicy, but without any seasoning it just wasn't that exciting to eat.   The empanadas were also disappointing. The outside was brittle and cracker-like, but I'm used to empanadas that are more on the flaky and thick side. When I bit in, the filling only took up about half of the crust, and it was just kind of bland.   On the plus side, the service was friendly and I'm really hopeful that they'll figure things out. I'll give it another try in a few months."}
{"text":"Just pure disappointment. There's nothing \"korean\" about the chicken. It is heavily battered without any seasoning or flavor. The empanadas are super salty and not worth the price. Will not be returning. If you are looking for authentic Korean chicken or empanadas, then you should look somewhere else."}
{"text":"The best lunch $12 can buy. PLEASE make the baogies a regular thing! Had the brisket one and saw Jesus..."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday with a friend for dinner. You order at the counter and your meal is brought out to your table when it's ready. The whole process was super easy and the food was amazing! I had the chicken and mushroom empanadas and the rice and beans. We also brought a bottle of wine since it is byob! Overall this is a great place for a quick snack or a full meal! I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Incredible fried chicken at an awesome price point. Two large pieces for $6 including a bao is PLENTY of food for dinner. This isn't your mama's fried chicken though- the tempura style breading is totally unique and makes for an extra crunchy and savory exterior. The empanadas are also excellent. I follow their social so i can pop in when they do specials which is all the time. It's nice to see a place that experiments with two very different culinary heritages in a laid back environment. In Lawrenceville, these guys have to be the best value in the entire neighborhood."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was very \"crunchy\" and lacked the seasoning that I would like in my fried chicken. The pricing is reasonable for gourmet fried chicken that is made to order.  As far as the chicken goes, I preferred the floured fried chicken rather than battered fried chicken. Bettered fried chicken should have a glaze, like the \"bon chon\" Korean fried chicken.  I don't understand the purpose nor I cared of the fried \"bao\" that accompanied the fried chicken. It was just a piece rice flour dough, filled with wilted chopped scallions in the middle of it. Not to mention that the frying made the \"bao\" greasy.  I did enjoyed the gochuchang dipping sauce that I chose with my friend chicken, but not the chimmichuri which had a strong scent of thyme in it.  I would have been satisfied with a metal tray of nicely seasoned fried chicken with some pickled veg or pickles. Over thinking and adding a component to a dish to fill up blank space is just not wise."}
{"text":"The things that are wrong are so frustrating, because they could be so easily fixed if the owners and staff put in just a little more care and attention:  The empanadas:  1. The empanada filling is not evenly distributed, so you suddenly get one big bite of olive all at once. Not very pleasant.  2. The empanada dough is raw. Fix this issue immediately.  I'm not the first reviewer to point this out. This is unforgivable. Either fix the empanadas, or just admit that they are not in your wheelhouse and take them off of your menu.   The chicken:  1. The chicken is way too greasy. Also not the first reviewer to point this out. Drain your chicken before serving it.   2. Too much breading. (Maybe this is intentional???) But I think most people would prefer a light crispy coat of breading that you get to eat with your chicken, rather than this big old thick coat of breading that ends up pulling off away from the chicken when you are trying to eat it. This makes actually eating the chicken an unpleasant mess of an experience.   I say frustrating, because with just a little bit of care and attention, the food here could be good or even great. The chicken is hot, and the breading is crispy and actually has a nice delicate flavor (not over-salted like most American \"Southern\" fried chicken). But it is all undone by the greasiness of the chicken, and the overly thick batter."}
{"text":"Are at this new restaurant yesterday. It was packed at 1 PM, so, had to wait 15 Minutes for the fried chicken. It was worth it. Each order is fried individually and comes out piping hot. Had the Pollo empanada, chicken breast and wing with Tamarind BBQ sauce and ginger soy sauce.  Was pleasantly surprised to find an order of homemade Pickles, a scallion bao bum and a cookie crusted with coconut. All for $9 something plus a tip. All very tasty and nicely spiced. Many veggie empanadas for vegetarians:  mushroom; pumpkin and 2-3 others that I can't remember. Worth a trip!!  Loved the modern decor and simplicity.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by, I had very high hopes for this place. I love fried chicken and I don't think it could ever be done wrong. However I was gravely mistaken. As I proceeded to order, they told me they were out of most items. Which was a huge disappointment to begin with. I ordered 3 pieces of chicken and two empanadas. As I bit in to the first empanada I realized the dough was raw, the inside was dry, and when I say dry I mean Sahara desert dry, this thing might as well have been named the \"dust bowl\" of the thirties. The crutch for this was the sauce, which was so sparse it might have well cost more than platinum, probably 5 drops at best in the tiny little cup they gave me.  I waited for the main course, 3 pieces of chicken. Everything looked alright, the first bite, very hot tender, but also under cooked. The batter had no seasoning, was basically just flower.... Huge disappointment. A 3 year old child could have made this for 50 cents. If this meal was 4$ I would have gladly taken the diarrhea I had afterwords and possibly come back for more, but only after a depressing day of beating myself up. However at a whopping 20+ dollars I think  I would need to have the worst day of my life and wanted to empty out all my accounts to come here. There are honestly way more choices for much less.  In my opinion, if you grew up in an Asian family and hear the word disappointment on the regular, this is the place to take your parents, maybe they will see you in a higher light by comparison. Or recommend this place to someone you really dislike but they don't realize it yet. Either way dollar for dollar I would go somewhere else, actually even if this place was free I would have to seriously consider somewhere else."}
{"text":"Chicken is very, very crunchy, which was generally appealing for the first few bites. The chicken I think was just about done. It looked and the texture looked like maybe it was at the safe point, but it was hard to determine if it was pink inside or not because of my next point.  The color of the interior lighting ranges from natural light to a red-orange light further back. (Made it a bit difficult to photograph, and felt like you were chicken under a heat lamp trying to stay warm.) Cold air rushes in as customers come and go.   Big fan of the pickles and the sauces!  I would go if someone suggested it, but I can think of other places I'd rather go in the area."}
{"text":"I just came here for the first time and it made my day. So, I was able to come here for lunch because the power went out in my office and I was able to head home and hook up with some friends to eat some chicken! I came to look at the menu and decided to stay. So the menu is pretty straight-forward so it is easy to decide, or so I thought. First, I had to decide if I wanted empanadas, or if I just wanted fried chicken. Oh wait, there is also a fried chicken sandwich too!  Ok. I just went for the chicken. I got the 2 piece instead of the 4 because and boy was I happy I did. The two pieces were huge. I ate one piece for lunch and the other for dinner. Seriously, the breast was almost even too much to eat for lunch. The 2 piece  meal came with a container of pickles and a bao bun. All of that for only $6. I MEAN REALLY??? That is a pretty good deal to me, considering that I ate it twice in one day.   The pickles are really good, they are new pickles so they have a tart, tender, and sweet taste to them. The container of them was pretty big, so that was nice. And I love pickles so getting more than just one sad spear is pretty nice. I ate all of the pickles for lunch, I could not save any.   The bao bun was also pretty amazing. It was a scallion bao bun and it was cooked perfectly. Nice and crisp on the outside and on the inside so soft and warm. Yum. Totally amazing. I ate half for lunch and half for dinner just like the rest of the meal.   You also get to pick one sauce to go with your meals. If you want more it is $1 extra and that seems a little unreasonable to me so I only tried one. I got the sambal sauce, this was a little spicy and coconutty. It was really good. I think that the coconut was a little overpowering but it was a nice mixture and I might try it again. I want to go back and try some of the other sauces, they seemed really good.   Now to the chicken. This chicken was amazing. It was fried to perfection, crispy, and super moist. I could not stop eating it once I started. The chicken was good and I was happy that I had enough restraint to save myself a piece for dinner. I would get this again for sure, and I would even share this meal and get empanadas so I would be full.   I loved it here. The inside was really nice, the staff was very sweet, and the food came fast. I would come again for sure and try out more of the menu items. Yummy."}
{"text":"Nice little place started by couple of local chef's.  It is fast and casual.  Did not try the empanadas but heard they were good.  Had the Korean fried chicken that comes with a delicious Bao bun and some good house pickles.  The chicken was tender, moist and very good. There are 5 sauces to pick from and some sides n' sweets.  The Kim Chi side was very good.  Can't wait to come back and try the empanadas. The place was busy.  There are a lot of tall tables for 4 or they can be changed to two.  When we arrived all were in use.  After we ordered at the counter, a table opened up.   The staff was very friendly and delivered our food and was clearing some tables when they had a chance."}
{"text":"Can't say that I've had a better fried chicken sandwich in the city. Absolutely phenomenal! Flavors were bursting on every tastebud in my mouth. The smell of fresh dough, vegetables and spices hit you from the moment you walk in. Employees take pride in this place and every bit of it shows.   I'm glad that I didn't wait a day later to come here. Nice, hip, easy going place with unmatched Korean cuisine. The chicken is fried to perfection and the empanadas and bao are light, fluffy and full of flavors. Did I mention it was BYOB with no corkage fee? Win! Get here now!"}
{"text":"Ki Pollo is the newest addition to the row of restaurants along Butler Street in Lawrenceville. The service is prompt and the staff is incredibly friendly. They feature baked empanadas and Korean Fried Chicken with various sauce choices.   I ordered the Combo which comes with a chicken breast, a thigh, a whole wing, and your choice of two empanadas and two sauces. They also give you a fried scallion bao bun and homemade pickles. The chicken was incredibly juicy and piping hot and the breading was very thick and crunchy but lacked a bit of seasoning. For my sauces, I picked the BBQ tamarind and the gochujan sauces. The BBQ tamarind was salty, savory, and slightly sweet. The gochujan is a thicker spicier sauce that packs a nice heat. Both great sauces for dipping the chicken into. The scallion bao was fried and has a prominent scallion flavor and is incredibly tasty - it's like biting into a pillow.   The two empanadas I ordered were the Pollo empanada and the Ham and cheese empanada. The Pollo was delicious and packed full of chicken. The Ham and cheese empanada was interesting and tasty but not nearly as filled as the Pollo empanada was. The lightly baked and fluffy dough on both were amazing. The empanadas came with a chimmi sauce too which was a bit too oil-heavy for my taste, but the herbs in the chimmi were very fresh.   Korean Fried Chicken and Empanadas are definitely a welcoming option to Lawrenceville. I look forward to trying the rest of their sauces and especially the alfajores."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this fried chicken joint as I have enjoyed my meals at Ki Ramen and Umami.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to its expectations. My friend and I both got their two piece fried chicken. I ordered a thigh, leg, and wing, but got two thighs and a wing. Their prices are very reasonable as two pieces of fried chicken are $6. They also have a variety of sauces. I got the sambal sauce, which had a nice coconut flavor.   We came on a Friday night and it was busy. The restaurant is pretty small. Our food came out  quickly. The chicken was nice and crispy. However, it was very oily. There were pools of it dripping on the tray. Also, you could fast the oil on the chicken. The chicken was tender though. The scallion bun was good too. Overall, would mostly likely not come back to this place due just feeling very greasy afterwards."}
{"text":"Willing to give it a second chance because it was opening week but we waited over a hour for couple pieces of fried chicken and empanadas. And they had run out of everything else. The staff was friendly but very slow...hopefully they will be better prepared for a Saturday night Lville crowd. Empanadas were good and assorted sauces were very flavorful!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here today to pick up some lunch. It wasn't crowded at all for it being a weekend, which surprised me. We were greeted right away by a very friendly cashier who gave us her recommendations for sauces and empanadas. We ended up getting a combo to go with the sambal and the tamarind sauce, as well as beef and mushroom empanadas. I was a bit concerned that they didn't close the fried chicken container and we were walking home in cold weather, but the chicken ended up still being piping hot when we dug in.   The chicken itself is very crispy and juicy. I like more breading on fried chicken so I have no complaints there, but I do think it could have used more seasoning. I liked the sambal sauce a lot. The scallion bun was delicious and fresh. I was slightly disappointed by the empanadas. They were decently flavored but very small. I preferred the beef over the mushroom. However, I think the chicken and bun were definitely the better part of the meal and next time I'll probably skip the combo with empanadas and just get chicken."}
{"text":"Enticed to enter Ki Pollo on a frigid Pittsburgh Winter day by a sign touting Chicken, Pasta Soup. Yum to warm a soul.   This small eatery was inviting and warm.  Hi-top tables line the walls and opposite the tables a case filled with a variety of empanadas.  From many of the tables you can view the handmade process of creating these delicious hand sandwiches.  The offerings are Beef, Chicken, Pumpkin, Mushroom Ham and Cheese and even Tofu.  While there, we enjoyed the Ham and Cheese and Pumpkin empanadas.  There are four side sauces to accompany your food choices.  Chimichurri, Sambal (hot, hot, hot), Ginger Soy and Tamarind BBQ were our selections for the meal.    The two piece chicken selection was a large fluffy soft deep fried breast and drumstick.  Served on a metal tray with pickles, and Bao Buns.  The texture of the buns is amazing, they will want you ordering more.   To round out the meal we had the kim chi - nice and spicy.  The menu did not list hot tea, but it is available.  Ki Pollo serves Stash Tea and the Raspberry is delicious.  I'm guessing you can BYOB there.  It was a sloppy day outside when I visited, and the staff was attentive to mopping the floor to keep the place nice and clean."}
{"text":"I decided to try Ki Pollo with a friend when walking Lawrenceville killing time while our candles at The Candle Lab cured. I'd never had empanadas so I was excited to try them out. I've been in three times now and all visits have left me wanting to return. I've had the beef, pollo, and shroom empanadas, all of which have been delicious! Pollo is definitely my favorite. I'm interested in trying the pumpkin next time I'm in! The chimichurri and sambal are both great compliments to the empanadas. The house pickles, kim chi, rice & beans, and scallion bao buns are all A+ sides. Definitely want to check out the miso collard greens. Be sure to grab an alfajor or two for dessert, they're a just sweet enough to dash a craving."}
{"text":"So good! Go NOW! We had 3 empanadas, the collard greens and two 2 piece chicken dinners. Literally everything was so good. Those buns are magic and the pickles are something to look forward too! The chicken is so crispy that you can tap that crunch and make sure you try some sauce. Not a fan of high top tables only one low top, but that is my preference. Atmosphere is nice overall and wasn't too loud. Can't wait to try some of their sweet stuff. What a gem Ki Pollo is!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Let me start with this FIRST- They are being slammed for an opening. As in - sold out hourly and they're still just chugging away pouring  their heart out. Cooking and refilling their kitchen to keep making more food. Which is just unreal.  I spoke to one of the cooks who happens to live near me. He said how much many hundreds of pounds of chicken they went through on their second day. Impressive. The dedication to their craftsmanship & patrons is just unheard of. They just keep cooking after selling out throughout the day. Their passion to keep serving. It's unreal!   So if you go over. Do NOT expect a full menu. I went in 3 times and found the menu picked over and half sold out. Today I went over & I ordered ahead and picked up an hour later knowing they were cooking and told to return in 45.    Now the food.   Empanadas & green chimichurri sauce-    I ordered chicken & pumpkin. I was hesitant to order pumpkin & almost didn't and am so glad that I did. The pumpkin empanada is surprisingly the best part of the meal. Which isn't easy to determine. The entire meal is delicious. The pumpkin is sweet, yet savory with a very slight smokiness while pairing nicely with the green chimichurri sauce that accompanies each empanada order. Each empanadas is packaged w their fresh chimichurri sauce. It's a very mild, fresh green sauce. Delicious. The empanadas are nice authentic palm sized piece. Perfectly made so that the purpose is cooked and crisp and the inside is cooked perfectly. Just right. (Not some bizarre, disgusting inappropriate sized & cooked Americanized bastard which was a relief)   The Buns, oh The Buns   Then there were the Buns. Oh. My. Goodness. I love the Buns. I could order just a dozen Buns and sit in the park and eat them. They are so good. Please don't judge me when you pass me on a bench doing that.   The Sauces.   I ordered extra sauce for my order. One of each. I found that I did like all of them however the soy did stand out for me. But it's a personal preference. There weren't any that I didn't like. Not a one. So when it comes to ordering, it's all what you prefer. Go with your gut. They're all really good & taste fresh.   The Chicken.   Ok so now that I've had their chicken twice, I have to say. I really like it & so do the kids. The kids like it a lot. The KIDS LOVE THE CHICKEN!Which is awesome. I'm super excited to have somewhere nearby that I can just grab fresh cooked food from that the kiddo loves.    So Ki Pollo has been open a week. I've been in 4 times. Gotten food twice. I'll be back a lot more and am being patient because I get that they're good is so awesome they're selling out as fast as they can cook. I get it. I love it too."}
