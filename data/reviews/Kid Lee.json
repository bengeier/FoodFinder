{"text":"Finally healthy, home cooking type food is available for lunch. Great quality and flavour spot on.  Hoping this sticks around!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought a cheeseburger spring roll would be so delicious? This is a must try, come early to skip the lunch lines and eat everything, including the lettuce and pickled veggies.  Ironically, I didn't like the singaporean slaw as much . The sweetness of the salad wasn't really my thing. And its a massive portion. I recommend sharing with a friend.  Overall really good food. Who cares if he's related to Susur or not."}
{"text":"Came on the day of the opening. I heard about it from Kai's Instagram page and since I had the day off I decided to try it out. It's on the second floor of the First Canadian Place building right next to the Five Guys in the food court area. They had hot tables and the salad side for Susur's signature Singapore slaw as well as fresh cheeseburger spring rolls that kept coming out.   You can choose from 1 base, 1 protein, and 2 sides for $14 or get the Singapore slaw for $13 and able to add on a cheeseburger spring roll for $5.  They also had an area for on the go foods that included fresh coconut juice, banana coconut chia pudding, yogurt parfait and tarts and cookies.   I enjoyed the salad but wished the spring roll was a bit cheaper and not much meat filling although it was still very good! I definitely want to come back to try the hot table combo.   Congrats Kai, Levi and Susur on the opening!"}
{"text":"It's so good. Love their famous coleslaw. It is definitely worth $13 because they pack it in a large salad bowl. The vegan chicken is good too but a little salty, still great though if you get it with rice and veg."}
{"text":"Picture this: Order the famous slaw. Bite into it.  Despite the 19-ingredient claim to fame, after the first basil-y bite the rest tastes like plain, shredded cabbage.  Try a singular cheeseburger spring roll.  Tastes like cold Hamburger Helper, shaped into a log.  Wash it all down with a can of root beer (the only OK item).  Now burn a $20 bill.   Ta-da!  You've just experienced Kid Lee."}
{"text":"Very tender and deliciously sitting on creamy mash, definitely unbelievable when it is fast food.  This lunch is definitely work the trek at the downtown path.  Will come back here soon to try out the slaw."}
{"text":"I had been to Lee before but didn't have a chance to try their slaw, so when Kid Lee opened, I couldn't resist.  The line was very busy at lunchtime on Friday, which meant the ingredients were very fresh and everyone was on their top game.  Susur himself was there supervising everyone to make sure the slaw is made to his exacting standards, from mixing all the way to plating and placing the flower petals on the takeout bowls.  The mix of crunch peanuts, fried rice vermicelli, and basil makes me appreciate the craftsmanship that went into designing this bowl of slaw.  As for those complaining about price, you would have to pay $13 for a similar 'box' or 'bowl' at other healthy eateries in the FCP food court, so I feel that I'm getting decent value considering Kid Lee has Susur Lee's name associated with it."}
{"text":"Based on the slaw, it's not the same.  They add more chrispies which changes the texture of the slaw.  Also the wait line isn't clear and distinctive as I waited in the longer line and didn't know the no-wait line was for the salad.  Overall experience wasn't great."}
{"text":"PSA: NO CASH only card & Apple Pay here!   My first reaction to Kid Lee was how aesthetically pleasing it is. Minimal yet modern- the menu is straight forward. To be honest, as a first timer I was quite confused. There are TWO separate lines depending what you order. One line is dedicated to slaw orders only (13$) and their slaw seems to be what they advertise most and the most popular. The other line is for everything else. It seems to be efficient during high volume times but when you're one of a few customers, I didn't know what I was doing lol.   When I finally figured it out , I decided to order the slaw and a juice. The juice was AMAZING. I got the mango, strawberry & OJ. Insanely delicious and not overly sweet. The slaw was even better! I've never had a slaw impress me so much. It was so unique. Fresh flowers, ginger, crunchy taro, peanuts, pickled onions etc...fantastic ingredients that make a perfect slaw medley. It was more than a boring soggy slaw. 13$ May seem much for a slaw but you get quite a lot. I was full half way through and it's made fresh in front of you. Tbh, I wish the slaw was more acidic or more vinegar based as it is quite sweet. But regardless my boyfriend and I enjoyed our first experience. Much better than the other lee restaurants in general.   Efficient service, great food. I'm excited to come back!"}
{"text":"Cashless. Card only.  I heard a lot about Kid Lee before they open since I follow the Bent-Lee brothers on social media. Shout out to Kai and Levi. So I first visited when they just opened and tried the hot food items. You can choose your base, protein (salmon, beef, etc) and then select two sides. The items are definitely a bit different in terms of food court style food. I got the mash potatoes for the base, salmon for the protein and vegetables for the side. I thought the hot food was just average and wasn't anything special.  However, on my second visit, I decided to get the Susur Lee's signature slaw and definitely it is my favourite thing on the menu. The slaw has 19 ingredients and everything blends in very well together. It's cold like a salad and it has great taste. You can also had protein to it so I added the other signature item which is a cheeseburger spring roll. The cheeseburger spring roll was amazing and its definitely a must try item with the slaw. It's good but I do not think its worth $5.   I find the pricing quite high as a slaw and spring roll cost around $20. I would definitely be back once a month to eat the slaw though. They gotten me hooked to it."}
{"text":"All I wanted was the singapore slaw. It took 45 minutes to get from order to pickup. Honestly, they really need to work on their logistics if they want more business. I would try other things but to be a viable concept in the financial district thats a fresh QSR restaurant, they need to be quicker. That word is obviously key.  The food they serve isn't really that healthy. They have a little more varied options than typical asian places. I'll stick with Kupfert and Kim for innovative and healthy."}
{"text":"In terms of fast food from a food court, kid Lee really stands out. Imaginative menu. I had the caramelized salmon on millet with spicy ginger soy broccoli and an amazing watermelon avocado salad. Will definitely return. Used ritual app and had order ready in 8 min."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it but was disappointed.  first, I asked if I could do half millet and half mash for my base. she didn't pause to consider and just said she couldn't because they need to keep track of inventory. really? ended up choosing millet to be healthty- and it tasted dissapointingly healthy.  for meat I had the braised beef, which was delish. great gravy too that helped with the dry millet. and for 2 sides: Spicey broccoli  (a bit too fishy from dried shrimp) and yummy root veg. I will try again because Susur Lee is amazing... usually"}
{"text":"Pros:  The food was very good!  Had the leek & potato mash, chicken, broccoli & roasted root veg.  Of course, the singapore slaw.  And a fresh coconut!    Con:  The hot food line was SLOW and portions not that generous for the price of $14.  Verdict:  Would go back to try the other hot food, but hope they are more generous with the portions in the future for that price point."}
{"text":"I got the signature 15 ingredient slaw ($15) with the braised beef ($5). This place is located in the food court at first Canadian place. It is a bit pricey for a quick lunch, but delicious. The slaw is very flavourful, you can see and taste the edible flowers. The braised beef is so tender and flavourful as well.   If you want to splurge for lunch, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"singapore slaw at kid lee is a disappointment in comparison to what you get at the restaurant. i tried the foodcourt slaw 2x to make sure going on the first week wasnt a rare miss.  i think the core missing ingredient is the lack of fresh greens.  its suppposed to be a salad isnt it? but u only get a smalll sprinkle of greens and overpowering pickled, fried ingredients. i adored the slaw at the restaurant but kid lee just doesnt compare. i would choose other foodcourt salad places over this replica slaw."}
{"text":"Not the same quality as Lee restaurant.   I love the slaw at Lee and order it everytime I'm there. I expected a similar tasting slaw at Kid Lee and was thoroughly disappointed. The slaw was bland and lacked the brightness and freshness that the restaurant one has. It was almost like they watered down the dressing or something.   I also ordered a side of BBQ chicken. This was ok, but it was a very small box with very small pieces of chicken.   I would have been willing to try this place again, but after eating these items for lunch, I got a mild case of food poisoning."}
{"text":"Have always wanted to try out the Susur Lee's restaurants and particularly the much hyped Singapore Slaw. When this place opened I had made a note of it to visit.   Reached a bit late for lunch and therefore no long lineups. Was going to have the salad a bit later so opted for the prepackaged but not mixed together salad. Comes in a neat little container with Fried Rice Noodles, Pickled Ginger, Plum Dressing, slaw carrots, fried taro slaw, jicama and quite a few other stuff all packed in a container. And yes peanuts.   Having a sign that there is a vegan \"chicken\" dish made with tempeh, peaked my interest and took a side of that as well. Not sure if it is normal, but not only they had tempeh but also a chickpea and green pea dish topped up. Which made it a bit difficult to know what was what.   The salad absolutely perfect with so many ingredients and textures. The dressing not so good - a bit too sweet for my taste. Even though I put 3/4 of the dressing it was way too much sweet. Would have preferred a more balanced palate. I could have that salad no dressing without any complaints whatsoever.   The tempeh pieces amazing. The chickpeas and green peas were as I called it al-dente. Had a bit of a crunch to it. Loved it. Not sure which of the two had pineapple though. Which made some spoonful - sweet!  Again disappointing for me.   $20 for take out lunch also is on the high side in a food court makes it a bit out of reach."}
{"text":"Fantastic tasty, flavorful light salads with 19 ingredients and the best egg roll I've ever had.  A little on the pricey side for a food court but still worth the price."}
{"text":"I paid $26 for the slaw with some chicken and one spring roll... too overpriced for food court food in my opinion  To be fair the slaw was quite good but the chicken was dry"}
{"text":"Ok, I admit it. I have never been to Lee. Have been to other Lee brand restaurants, but never the actual \"LEE\", so this was my 2nd opportunity to have some of the slaw.  Used Ritual, and had it pre-ordered. It was ready to go, packaging looked nice, and didnt have to wait in line at all. Opened the salad, and really wondered - did I just spend $13+tax on a 1/2 size salad?  Salad was good, still needed a second meal to fill me up.  Please increase the serving sizes..."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try the Singapore Slaw this afternoon. My takeaway: This definitely feels 100% like a novelty item more than a nutritious or even a mouth-watering taste experience.   Portion: I'm surprised to say this did not fill me up, as I'm not a big eater (usually have leftovers when ordering poke bowls). I would compare the size and \"fill up factor\" to that of a mid-sized starter salad.   Taste: I was honestly hoping for a more fresh mouth feel. I would have preferred more fresh ingredients and less \"fried/crisp/taro root chips\" in each bite.  I would have given this 4 stars but it loses a star for feeling like more of a \"cheat day\" choice and less of a nutritious option that I can feel great about eating every day.   Hoping to try the hot combo soon. Will bump up the rating if it's a more positive experience."}
{"text":"Really expensive but the Singapore Slaw is the best salad I've had in my life.  I suppose you pay for good quality and one of a kind flavor that you can't really get anywhere else."}
{"text":"Okay... Honestly, the food tasted great and I would've given a 5-star rating had it not been for the hair that I found in the mashed leek/potato... again, great food and this may not bother some but once you see a hair (I have black hair and the one I found was blonde) you can lose your appetite in an instant and that's all it is."}
{"text":"Good food but they need to change the packaging for the Slaw. I lost half my Slaw when the lid opened up.   I had the Slaw which is amazing and the cheeseburger spring roll. It's ok but not really worth the price. You get very little for the extra $5 protein add-on. The Slaw will fill you up so no need to get anything else. It's a little pricey at over $14 but that's the going rate for any salad/box in the financial core."}
{"text":"Similar to the other reviewers, I got their signature slaw and cheeseburger spring rolls. Both were good but just 3 stars for the price.   The slaw sauce was too sweet, a common complaint, and it's not as good as the restaurant slaw. The spring roll tastes exactly like a cheeseburger deep fried in a spring roll wrap, and tastes like how you imagine it.  Overall good points: I ate a lot more vegetables than I usually do at lunch, the packaging was fancy, and the slaw has edible flowers. I also saw whole coconuts which you can buy if you like coconut water/juice.  Kid Lee is definitely a standout in that food court, taste is ok but just too expensive to make it a regular thing."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the Grand Opening of Kid Lee. I was beyond excited!   Susur Lee is one of my favorite chefs. He is known for his famous Singaporean Slaw which you can get at Lee on King West. Another signature item is his famous cheeseburger spring rolls. In my opinion he is probably one of the best Fusion Chefs.   Kid Lee is the latest concept from the family. It's a Grab and Go kind of place at First Canadian Place. You can choose your Base, Protein and Sides. They also do the famous Singaporean Slaw to go and Cheeseburger Spring rolls.   The eldest son served me the Cheeseburger Spring roll and I also ordered the Slaw. Now it obviously tastes different at the restaurant because you are served right away, whereas I had my slaw in a to-go container, nevertheless it still tasted great.   I will definitely be back as service was quick and the food is delicious!   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"Slaw was only half filled to the box but the braised beef add on was a good value. Tender, juicy."}
{"text":"The Asian slaw is technically cheaper ($19) at lee because the serving size is equivalent for 2 people whereas the slaw at kid lee is $13 for a serving size equivalent to 1 person. If you're craving something different from the typical options at the FCP food court, it's worth trying as an alternative. It's not so healthy but delicious - I'd recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"The Lee empire's first foray into fast casual food in the food court at First Canadian Place is a definitely a welcome addition to the boring options that the corporate crowd have to decide between on a daily basis.  You can either choose to get Susur Lee's famous Signature Singapore Slaw or from a wide range of carbs/proteins/veggies to make your own customized bento box of food. This place uses organic ingredients where possible and the ingredients are super fresh and tasty.  Signature Singapore Slaw ($13) The slaw is vegetarian friendly and is absolutely delicious. They are made to order and is the perfect balance between crispy, crunchy, tangy, fresh and delicious. Normally I get bored of eating salads and tired of chewing but this salad is so good. Even though there isn't meat, I'd eat it regularly as it's so tasty.  Bento Box ($14) There is a wide range of options to choose from and today I got Miso Glazed Salmon on a bed of Leek Mashed Potatoes accompanied with Steamed Veggies and Spicy Broccoli. The salmon was cooked perfectly and had a wonderful umami flavour to it. The mashed potatoes were creamy and smooth while the steamed veggies were just okay. The star was definitely the broccoli that was surprisingly very flavourful.  In future visits, I've swapped the mashed potatoes for all the other carb options.   The Tuscan Kale Salad that is really delicious and tangy, while the organic brown rice is cooked well and a nice change from the boring white steamed rice served elsewhere but my absolute favourite is the Millet with eggs as it's something that isn't served anywhere but has a lot of flavour.  My favourite protein has to be the organic beef short rib stew with sour cream. The short rib is fall apart tender and the gravy that it accompanies it is so fricking flavourful.  I've also tried the cheeseburger spring roll that is tasty no doubt, but overpriced at $5 for one single roll.  Overall, the place isn't cheap but is a good option for a change of place from all the chinese/thai/schwarma place that litter the downtown core."}
{"text":"The first time I had Chef Susur Lee's Signature Singapore Slaw, I thought it was the best tasting salad I've ever had! This version, served in a takeout bowl in a food court, didn't have the same visual impact (or price) but it sure tasted darn good! I don't know what all 19 ingredients are but I recognized a few things that I don't normally eat. Somehow they all play very well together in this dish. That doesn't mean I'm going to start eating cucumbers and beets and I probably won't be munching on flowers from the garden.  Kid Lee is probably the most attractive stall in the food court at First Canadian Place. Its white marble fits the theme of the building. Classy. The main service counter is divided in two, with half of it dedicated to serving the slaw and the other half serving hot food. There's a smaller counter around the corner for pre-orders and grab and go items.  I ordered the slaw with BBQ chicken on the side while my two dining companions held our table. I returned and they went to get their food. They both came back with the slaw, and a side of the slow braised beef! Really?!? Of all the choices in the food court, we all end up with the same thing? What happened to sharing and tasting?  We all enjoyed our meal so it was a good choice. The beef was flavoured with star anise and was very tender. The chicken had a nice flavour and complemented the slaw very well but wasn't anything too special on its own. I'm rarely in this area and I don't know when I'll be back but I'll definitely keep Kid Lee in mind."}
{"text":"Gourmet fast food without breaking your wallet by Susur Lee. Kid Lee is a new addition to the downtown financial district food court scene.   Since I work nearby I gave it a try for my Friday lunch and ordered from the hot food menu. Which you get to pick your choice of one carb, one protein and two sides/greens for $14.   I ordered...  Carb - Leek and Potato mash (smooth and creamy mash with well seasonings) Protein - Slow braised beef with chived sour cream (the sauce is flavourful and the sauce goes perfect with the mash) Sides - Spicy sauteed broccoli (kinda disappointed that they only gave me 3 pieces of broccoli and tasted nothing special, I would get something next time)  Moroccan chickpea stew (very good and flavourful, I would love to steal the recipe of this and make my own).   I also added Chef Lee's famous cheeseburger spring roll on the side ($5)  Overall, I liked my meal and I would revisit again to try other food items and the signature slaw."}
{"text":"For a fast food place, it's really good. I would recommend the beef because the chicken was really dry (though it could have been because it was an hour before closing time).  The mashed potatoes were so good!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here twice so far and a few things to note:   Singapore Slaw - $13 - Absolutely worth the $$ - It's also vegan if that matters to you. With so many specialty ingredients (many hard to find) this is not something I'd make myself at home.  You can take it \"to go\" and prepare later with a rotisserie chicken which I've done - easy dinner.     Cheeseburger Spring Roll - $5 - pretty good. I remember them being better at Lee. A bit messy to eat but tasty.    Build Your Own - $14 - comes with 1 base, 1 protein, and 2 sides.  I've tried the potato mash base which is very good, especially with the braised beef.  The chicken was just OK, thigh meat and not a huge portion - better bang for your buck (and tastier!) in my opinion is the beef.  Root veg & broccoli on the side, so-so.  The all-star is definitely the braised beef/mashed potatoes. Total comfort food.    Service is a bit wonky / disorganized at times.  Susur is there at other times and keeps things together.  Today at the ritual counter it was a bit of a shit show but the quality is top notch, so I'm sure these workflow issues will sort themselves out with time."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today as I heard this place newly opened in the FCP food court. I don't think the food lives up to the hype and it's also pretty pricey! Be prepared for super long line ups if you come after 12pm.  I ordered their signature Singaporean Slaw and Cheeseburger Spring Roll, which totalled $20. My two friends ordered the same but added protein; one added chicken and the other added beef, and it came out to roughly $26 each. I didn't think the Singaporean Slaw is that good although it is their signature dish. To be fair though, I don't like pickled ginger so that could be a reason why I didn't completely enjoy it. The cheeseburger spring roll is really small, literally just one small spring roll. I had a taste of the chicken and beef protein sides that my friends ordered and didn't think it was anything special. Based on the reviews below, I might give it another try and order from the hot table next time."}
{"text":"I got the signature slaw and cheeseburger spring roll. The slaw is very sweet, and halfway through eating it, I got sick of it. The cheeseburger spring roll is alright.   I went to Lee and ordered the signature slaw a couple weeks after. It was much better - less sweet and tasted more fresh. If you want to try the slaw, I highly recommend going to the restaurant."}
{"text":"When I see Sursur Lee behind something, I normally anticipate quality ingredients and fantastic taste profile. Sadly, I cannot say so for Kid Lee. I only tried the $13 Singapore slaw, which is on the  expensive end of downtown toronto lunch salad selections (and small) while my colleague tried slaw and the signature cheeseburger spring roll. Taste could have made the price somewhat worthwhile but it was too sweet. The look and texture felt more like a side in a combo and not as a dish on its own.  Also, if the same menu offerings are made at Lee and Kid Lee (i.e.the slaw and the spring roll), the consumer should be able to expect the same quality; it is not about the price tag. I am not convinced I will spend $13 on a small salad again but I have seen some willing to. But, if the taste cannot be matched then Kid shouldn't offer them; I think it ruins the impression of the more upscale Lee (at least mine is).  Compared to nearby choices, the overall experience seems overly hyped and does not have the same premium value for $$$."}
{"text":"I am in love with Kid Lee. I was skeptical at first. Even though it has the Susur Lee name to it, it's in a food court and online menu choices/prices look slightly questionable. There are 2 separate lines, one for hot food and one for their signature Singapore Slaw. The line moves fast and there is staff handing out paper menus. There is also Susur in person :) I'm very impressed by their presentation and efforts to elevate the food court experience. The marble design is modern. The pink premium cook ware is a nice touch over chaffing dishes. I picked braised beef on mash with roast root veggies and steamed veg. The steam veg tasted like it was garlic sautéed, nothing screams at you about it. The root veg is hands down one of the best I've had, everything was nice and tender with loads of flavour. I also liked how it didn't feel too \"starchy\". Mash was smooth and silky - the perfect backdrop to their OMG-so-delicious beef. You slide through the beef with a plastic fork like whipped butter and it was delicious. The chive sour cream was a nice touch but I don't think it was life changing. Because I got mash, they were very generous with the gravy. Cons: I felt their portions are not super consistent, my friend got almost double the amount of sides when we opt for similar choices. Limited menu choices - it'll be nice if they can add daily specials or some kind of rotation to mix it up. I feel the food was worth the price, it taste like a restaurant quality meal I would have paid a lot more for. Yes, it's a food court...but you'd pay similar prices for a similar protein + sides combo at McEwans or Pusateri's nearby, both are significantly sub par in quality. It's well-worth the splurge to me if you are looking to treat yourself to something fancier but can't afford the time for sit down lunch."}
{"text":"The service ppl not that nice... very tasty slaw but lil bowl of salad for 15 bucks? There are way more better places for what you're looking for."}
{"text":"So glad that I got to try the famous slaw! It was beautiful and delicious! Also added a cheeseburger egg roll and had the mango peach lemonade. Everything was perfect! We went in the evening about an hour before they close and there was no line. Paid $25 for dinner at a food court. There are reviews that complain about the price but I don't mind paying because it was that good! Actually it's a fraction of the price if I went to their sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! So far I tried the Singapore slaw and it is as good as it looks. The dressing is just the right amount sweet and sour. Salad is crunchy and fresh.   There Are 2 lineups. One for hot plates and the other for the slaw. Just make sure you pick the right line up when you get there. It can be quite confusing during the lunch rush.   My lunch mates tried the hot plates. They got through the crazy lineups about 10mins faster than I did in the slaw lineup. Their meals looked great too.   The Asian chicken is on the sweeter side. Like a sweet teriyaki flavour. The salmon was very good too. The servings are generous but so is the price. A salad with chicken cost me around $20.  The line ups are crazy. But just order through ritual app and the salad will be waiting for you much faster. I will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Kid Lee was quite good I have to say.   Went on an afternoon weekday (not open weekends) and there was no line. Easily found a table as well. Their storefront is a bit hidden close to the back of the food terrace,  if they are indeed there.   Kid Lee has a really nice storefront, little details like marble, aesthetic crockpots and unique scrabble like signage make for a very aesthetic appearance. They also play some hype music (thanks to the Bent-Lee) brothers. Speaking of the Bent-Lee family, you may even run into Susur Lee himself!   Anyways, the cuisine is fusion like most of Susur's restaurants. They have Asian flavours as well as Moroccan, and Canadian. You start with a base, choose a protein and then 2 sides. It costs about $15 for the box, which is a bit on the pricey side but the portions are decent. At first I thought the portions were small but after eating, it was decent. Got the leek and mashed potato, miso glazed salmon, Moroccan chick peas, and noodles.   The mashed potatoes were AMAZING! So creamy and delicious. Salmon was good, but portion size was a bit small. The chick peas had a lovely flavour and the noodles were cooked well and seasoned nicely.   My total came to $21 because I opted for the fresh pressed juice as well. Tasted delicious but needed more of that! It was Apple, strawberry, banana and orange. Very fresh and tasty, but too small containers.   As a lunch spot which caters to people in the building, it's not the cheapest spot around but it is delicious. I'd definitely opt for it as a healthy choice every once in a while as the food is fresh and flavourful. The little details really make the difference for me."}
{"text":"Usually when line ups for a foodcourt restaurant are 50 people deep, I can't believe that it's just quality over hype.   But that all changed with my visits to kid lee.   Honest to god, that cole slaw has something highly addictive within. The braised beef is so damn good and the cheeseburger spring rolls are tiny pieces of happiness in an otherwise dull and grey day.   The hype is real. The slaw is legit."}
{"text":"Salad is not the first thing that I gravitate towards at a restaurant, but when visiting Chef Lee's restaurant, I had to try the Singapore slaw. This restaurant is on the 2nd floor food court at First Canadian Place. There are 3 lines, one for hot food, one for the Singapore slaw, and one for pickup. The lines were all equally long, but once I reached the front of the line, there was only a wait for the Singapore slaw. The Singapore slaw is made to order and they do a really good job of moving the line. However, it still took about 15 minutes to reach the front.  I ordered the slaw, which comes in a fairly large takeaway bowl. The slaw is a mix of 19 ingredients that reminded me of the types of things that I ate while growing up - vermicelli, taro root, peanuts, shallots, cucumbers, carrots, etc. Needless to say I really enjoyed it. There was an amazing combination of bright flavors, savoriness, and the crunchiness from the fried taro, vermicelli, and peanuts. Best salad ever. I also ordered a side of braised beef. It was extremely tender and juicy. The meat just melts in your mouth and I can only describe it as buttery.  I've been eyeing this restaurant for the past month and I'm glad that I came here for lunch. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Overprice for lunch in the food court - first time experiencing this - average for these salads  -  should reconsider the pricing for more business maybe 12 for the salad slaw and 2 to 3 for the sides.  you will get more business.  Food was great not crazy amazing."}
{"text":"Had the short rib, mashed potatoes, veggies.. Came to around $15 which is in line with similar lunches in the concourse.. You pick 1 protein, 1 carb, 2 sides.. portion was good, can't complain.. its more then I get at McEwans with their combo deal.. the short rib was delicious, mashed potatoes was good, greens a bit on the bland side but I can deal with that.. I had gravy from the short ribs which was rich to balance it out.. the only thing is that the paper containers completely wilted by the time I walked back to my office.. in less then 10 mins, it became a soft disintegrated soggy container, under the weight and heat of the food which was somewhat irritating when trying to hold/carry/eat... need to upgrade to stronger, thicker containers.. would go back"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back.   Went for lunch on Friday and wanted to try as much as we could so this was our order:   Singapore slaw - amazing, I loved that the top was crunchy and under it there was a super flavourful slaw. I would go back just for this.  Cheeseburger spring roll - good, a bit expensive for $5 but I would eat again.  Braised beef with mash, broccoli & Moroccan chick peas - so much yum, I wish there was more gravy because that on top of the potatoes was so good.  Salmon on farro with broccoli and root veg - salmon was a teeny bit dry, I presume it's because they cook it ahead of time and keep it ready to serve. The farro was super flavourful and not at all what I was expecting. I'm not usually someone that likes grains other than rice but this was delish.   The lines are long, we ordered through ritual and only had to wait about 15 minutes. If I go at a time that's less busy I would definitely order a juice or something, they also look really good.   We got lucky and went on a day where the guys were working behind the counter and serving food, probably the highlight of my lunchtime adventure."}
