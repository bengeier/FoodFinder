{"text":"We actually had our wedding reception at l'Ambroisie. The service, the food, the location, it was marvelous.

The owner took the time to sit with us during the tasting prior to the actual wedding date. All our requests were met and even surpassed.

Thanks to the whole team who helped make this day unforgettable."}
{"text":"Average service. Way too long to prepare simple items like a sandwich or a salad. Too expensive."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had a nice simple lunch at this place.  It's located in the historic Château St. Ambroise (http://www.chateaustambroise.ca/en/Heritage/), next to Lachine canal, cross from Aubut.  It seems like most of the clients are from the offices inside the building.  They open long hours - Breakfast to dinner with full bar.  They serve decent good value food - reasonable price for very good size portion food and tasty.  The server was very friendly and efficient.  Inside building is very nice.  Next time when we have time, we will look around more leisurely.  Since St. Ambroise Terrasse is closed until next summer, this is \"the place\" to go after nice walk around the canal for lunch, dinner or/and drink and snacks.  During the weekend, they have lots of weddings or events happening.  so if you are planning for something like that, you might want to check this place out - of course for next spring and summer, it's already so cold here!"}
{"text":"Mon avis portera sur les plats pris à emporté. Je n'ai pas testé le restaurant sur place.
Au niveau de ce qui est proposé à emporté il y a des changements quotidien. On retrouve toujours les mêmes bases (burgers, wrap sandwichs, ...) mais cela change au niveau des goûts. 
Il est possible de prendre un ou deux à côté avec cela. Par exemple soit soupe soit frite soit salade. 
Je ne vous conseille pas les frites qui à mon goût sont horriblement grasses ...
Pour le reste je trouve que pour le prix c'est vraiment une bonne alternative si tu n'as pas ton lunch ou que tu veux manger rapidement. C'est mon alternative personnelle quand je n'ai pas envie de sortir dehors pour acheter un lunch rapide !"}
{"text":"Good food, but our table didn't receive it until almost 10:30 p.m. No explanation given. This was a catered event for approximately 200 people."}
{"text":"I walked in Restaurant l'Ambroisie with my husband with no particular expectation, but only the hope of finding something good for lunch at a place we hadn't tried yet. What we found was mostly disappointment.

While the food wasn't a total disaster (we ate most of it and did not suffer intoxication after all), it was a rather average experience. The waitress, who seemed very blasée but who offered us a timely service nonetheless, brought us a very watery mushroom cream first, which would have been okay if the dish had been called soup instead of cream. It was the first time my husband and I had encountered a botched mushroom cream. When Tim Horton's, a fast food chain, beats you at making a proper cream, there's a problem. Moving on.

We then had a vegetarian lasagna with a side of salad. The salad itself was a bit pitiful and lifeless, tossed greens with boring ranch topping and a swirl of carrots as decoration. The lasagna was alright, but we both agreed it lacked spices, and that it felt like it had been reheated. The ingredients did not taste fresh at all. It was however filling.

Finally, somehow managing to find some remaining hope in our hearts, we ordered the crème brulée. What we were presented with somewhat looked like it, but a bite of it revealed a gelatinous pudding-like substance which was definitely unlike any crème brulée we ever had. For the first time ever, we did not finish our dessert. It was gross and a total failure. 

Other than that, the tea and coffee were surprisingly alright, but the cups were significantly stained with tea. I know, being a regular tea drinker, that scrubbing hard to remove the stains can be tedious, but c'mon, we are talking about running a purported \"French Restaurant\" here, I'm actually paying for my meal! 

The room was decorated as a blend of 90s faux classical decor. At night it might be charming, however with all the details revealed by the daylight it looks a bit dated and tacky. I don't like to judge a book by its cover, but they would benefit from a redesign, if only to improve the visual and spatial experience. And hey, maybe a new improved decor could actually up the morale of the employees and encourage the cooks to actually produce quality food! Alright, I'm done.

The bill amounted to almost $50. In my heart, I felt I had been ripped off when I went to pay at the counter. The only person deserving their money at Restaurant l'Ambroisie is the waitress; the cooks and whoever reheated the food on their end did a very poor job combined.

I was disappointed and I will not be back."}
