{"text":"We love this place, and eat here frequently! The fish tacos are the best I've ever had! All the food is great! Staff is super friendly! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat. Great fajitas and chimichangas, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the service. I've never had a visit where our server was friendly and talked to us or started conversation. But they are always prompt and do refill drinks which is a plus side. I'll keep coming here"}
{"text":"After being a fan of Tequilla's in downtown Gastonia, I hoped I could get the same great food here.  Not So.  The salsa was very bland. I got the fish tacos. At the other location, these were spicy and great. The same dish here is tasteless.  My son got the steak burrito.  He said it was ok, but bland also. Very disappointed.  Service was OK."}
{"text":"I visited this place with my daughter who came to visit and was craving Mexican, so based on the reviews we choose Tequila. Wish I hadn't. First thing getting in the server was friendly but flat out admitted that he was new and did not knew the menu so he had to keep going back inside to ask if the items we wanted were available. Then when I asked to be moved to an another table because the AC was to strong and it was bothering me, they actually let my daughter carry the basket of chips and silver ware without offering any help. The dipping salsa was far from original the server admitted that it came from a can and was the only one they serve. When the food came out the enchiladas with green salsa looked like someone had vomited over them.  My daughter refused to eat it, not only for what it looked like but for the tasteless flavor. We know Mexican food, and that was definitely not it. The tostadas with bean and chicken was soggy and you could not tell what was chicken or flour soggy tortillas. .. the steak tacos were too salty and the meat so chewy that it felt plastic. .. finally we gave up and asked for the ticket without being able to eat anything of what was ordered. .. my daughter has refused to try another Mexican food place in town because she thinks every place will be as awful. .. 
Bottom line,  just because you look Mexican and maybe have some Mexican blood in you,  don't assume that you can cook Mexican, it does take real talent, please don't go giving a culture a bad name just because you fancy yourself a Mexican chef."}
{"text":"Reliably good food and some of the kindest staff around. The waiters are extremely friendly, and the nachos are always perfect."}
{"text":"Ive only been twice, but the tacos are great. Ive had the steak and the jalepno sauce is amazing. I really like this plaxe."}
{"text":"This place is easy to miss tucked into the corner in the Bi-Lo shopping center, but is worth stopping by if you're thinking Mexican food for lunch or dinner.  We enjoyed the food! I had the house specialty and it was delicious!  Also, I really like the hot salsa they serve with the chips.  I would prefer the chips to be a little bit thinner.  We would certainly eat here again!"}
{"text":"This place is truly hit or miss. On some occasions I've had excellent service and food, and on others I've had the complete opposite. When it's good, it's really good. We've had excellent wait staff in the past, but I've come to find that it truly depends on who you get as your server. While one waiter might be attentive and quick paced, another might all but ignore you. I went this past weekend and the latter was unfortunately my experience. I do believe the waiter was busy (although, to be fair, the restaurant certainly wasn't overwhelmed with guests at this point), but it took him 15 minutes to take our drink order - we almost got up and left. From there, there was an extended period of time in between requests and his checking on us. We would go without refills and requests (i.e. we didn't have tortillas for our fajitas) for several minutes. When he was attentive, he was kind though. 

As for food, this is also hit or miss. I routinely get the chicken fajitas and I swear it depends on who's cooking that night as to whether or not they're going to be good. I've had them before where they are excellent (which is probably why I continue to order them); they are hot and fresh and flavored so well. I've also had them before where they were cold and over cooked and overall disappointing. 

Last thing I'll say, be prepared to wait FOREVER for to go orders. I ordered before I left the house and even gave them an extra few minutes on top of when they said it would be ready. When I arrived, it was a solid  20 MINUTES before someone would go grab it for me. This is partially because you have to pick it up from the bar and that person is usually also making drinks....so you're just standing there....waiting. They don't prioritize their to-go customers at all. Two other people were waiting with me and someone finally said, \"before you do anything else, can you please go grab our food, we've been waiting a really long time.\" That was fairly frustrating.

Nonetheless, I will continue to visit Tequila's because more often than not we leave pleased. It's good food for cheap."}
{"text":"Great food, hot and fresh. Chimichangas are great. Nachos n salsa good as well, both hot and mild. This is the 4th Mexican restaurant in Gastonia I ate in, only one with vegetarian  chimichangas."}
{"text":"Was in the area and looking for some Mexican food to go, figured I would give this place a shot. Ordered a fish burrito online and picked it up about 10 minutes later. It was ready when I got there, along with a big bag of warm tortilla chips (not salty which is good, and the salsa was great!).
The burrito was surprisingly good, and it cost about the same as a burrito at Chipotle would, only much better and without the food poisoning! 
Definitely plan on going back and trying more from this restaurant next time I'm in the area and craving some Mexican food.
Check it out, you will love it too!"}
{"text":"Tequilas is always up to par! Delicious, authentic dishes, great prices and service make for an excellent experience every time at either location. The chimichangas are amazing and their soups are outstanding. Arguably my favorite restaurant in Gastonia."}
{"text":"**update

This place had me severely sick. **


This is from a carry out POV only. 


I ordered chicken nachos. I was told these were the best chicken nachos I would ever have.  I am sure if they were properly put in separate containers like I requested, they probably would have been. However, they were not. 

When I got the nachos they were a mess to even attempt to eat. I was hungry so I did anyways. The chicken must sit in some sort of juice b/c it had made a lump of crap. Which is said cuz they had potential to be some amazing nachos. 


I didn't eat any of them, the texture was disgusting. Also, feel like I wasted my 6 bucks, all because they didn't do as they were told over the phone to do when we called in the order. 

So I might try them again, but not sure b/c once you feel like you got taken its not like you wanna throw away more money"}
{"text":"In love they have the best food ever. After being sick being able to eat was amaze balls I loved the service food was hot and very good. Rich in that Mexican flavor you want when you eat out. Queso dip is the fav with my kiddos. Love love love will always go here first"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Large Mexican beer selection with a couple of hard to finds Bohemia and Carta Blanca. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Love me my Tequila!!! Recently had the chicken salad.  OMG yum.  Food is simple, fresh, uncomplicated and good.  What more can you want!"}
{"text":"Good chips and guacamole and the waitress was nice. Other than that, worst Mexican I've had in a while. Steak was very overcooked, margaritas were really gross (not enough tequila and the mix they used was awful), and their beans were basically soup."}
{"text":"This place is really a hit or miss. The servers sometimes aren't the friendliest and don't always know what they are doing. The food is pretty good on a great night and just ok most of the time. They do have good pico. Very cheap when THEY get your order wrong. Will take it away from you to fix even though they've already put it down instead of saying \"just let me bring you what you ordered\". Example. Our son ordered a CUP of soup and when it came we knew it was a bowl so we asked nicely. \"Is this a cup\"? She replied no and proceeded to take it away and when I asked if she could just leave it she said no, the manager would need to see it or would get upset. Really?! Makes me wonder if they went and dumped half of it back. Funny other things like this happen a lot. They don't train staff well and/or there is a huge language barrier. Salsa verde isn't complimentary like at most places. Food can be inconsistent and prices have really come up. Unfortunately there aren't a lot of great Mexican restaurants in Gastonia so to get our fix we continue to go every so often."}
