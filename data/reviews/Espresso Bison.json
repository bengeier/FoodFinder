{"text":"So happy this place opened! Great coffee, super friendly staff. A much needed addition to the neighborhood and hopefully a sign of things to come. Fresh food also."}
{"text":"Excellent endroit calme pour prendre un café, manger un petit morceau ou dessert et travailler. Super sympathique! Le thé à la poire caramel est excellent!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality coffee from local Dispatch roasters prepared on high end coffee nerd machines (Slayer and Mod Bar espresso machines). Clean minimal decor. Small selection of pastries and panini. Very quiet atmosphere-this would be a good place to study or work without distraction but it's not really a big/loud enough place to come and hang out and talk. Still worth a visit to grab a nice coffee though!"}
{"text":"Espresso Bison just opened up during the holidays and I am already in love with this new neighborhood cafe. I love Centre-Sud and all the awesome spots nearby (and being super central, of course), but to be completely honest, I never thought I'd see the day when an independent coffee shop serving excellent coffee would just magically appear. Well that day has come!   The open space is nicely designed with a very minimalist décor and warm ambiance. The barista I have met so far is welcoming and super friendly, and makes a delicious cortado and cappuccino. There is a small collection of carefully curated local goods; soaps, coffee making tools, etc. available to purchase (anxious to see this selection grow in time), and you can also get your Dispatch Coffee beans here.  Great spot to stop by when in the neighborhood. I will definitely be enjoying this place as much as I can before the word gets out!"}
{"text":"Espresso Bison is a very simple place, if you're into minimalism you'll definitely like it there. The service was very good, the barista really took her time to prepare my order, I had a macchiato and a chocolate croissant... The macchiato was extraordinary (and there's no exaggeration there), they sell reallllly good coffee. I recommend this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Le meilleur café du quartier. As-tu besoin de plus d'info? Plutôt court comme commentaire, mais je pense que c'est l'essentiel pour un café, non? Je fais près de 10 minutes supplémentaires de marche pour aller chercher ma dose de café matinale chez Café Espresso Bison, ce qui est un exploit dans nos vies trop pressées."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe where the coffee is excellent & the staff is friendly. The place is small and quiet, perfect for a quick stop for coffee on the way to work."}
{"text":"Petit endroit coquet dans le quartier. Un des meilleurs latte dans le secteur. Les petits gâteaux et cie sont délicieux aussi. Chouette ambiance, pouvons acheter du café sur place aussi et quelques accessoires pour le café!"}
{"text":"Meilleur café du coin, sans hésiter.  L'endroit est tranquille, le staff est efficace et discret. J'adore les belles tasses de céramique !! Le café est super bon, bien sûr. Et je suis picky une affaire rare sur le café.   J'aime aussi le fait qu'il y a une table bien haute, je peux y travailler debout, ca fait changement.   C'est un oui!!"}
{"text":"Cute and simple cafe with plenty of seating.  Not good if you're in a rush. Maybe I'm just used to the NYC scene, but the coffee is made with great care, so you must be patient. My cortado was really nicely balanced.   There were a few pastries available when I stopped in on a Saturday. I went for the almond and chocolate pastry, which really hit the spot. It was delicious and not oozing with sugar - though, of course, it had plenty of sugar.   I love the local feel!"}
