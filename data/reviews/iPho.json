{"text":"Omg I love this place! I usually go to Pho Real in the University area yet it's so far from where I live. Their pho has great flavor and although it's about $11 per bowl, it's a pretty large serving. Customer service is awesome and there's even a cute little patio where you can eat outside! This is my second visit here but I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Udon noodles were out of this world. Chicken was tender and moist. Sauces were very flavorful. Very impressive first visit. I will surely be back for more yumminess!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is a hidden gem of a restaurant. The bahn mi was fantastic and the bahn xeo(Vietnamese yellow pancake) was out of this world. Beware- the full order of this is HUGE, even between 2 people!  This place is very family friendly (and we weren't even here with our kids)the staff was friendly and super accommodating. The owner was so sweet, showed us the traditional way of assembling our meal and just darn fun. We are from out of town and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for its grand opening weekend and we will be coming back! My husband and I got the pork and beef grilled sandwiches the meat was tender and flavorful nice grill flavor. The summer rolls that we got were great too the rice wrapper was still soft and the meats inside was easy to bite through and all the fillings inside tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Hien, the owner, spoke with us and was as warm and welcoming as the amazing pho. If you are from CA or NY you will KNOW good Vietnamese and this place has it!!  The Banh mi sandwich was so fantastic I literally had a sandwich in my left hand and pho in my right. I couldn't decide which to eat first so I dove into both. I will be back again and again and again and so should you!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME.   BEST Pho I have ever had and it is the REAL DEAL.  The owners and staff are very helpful.  The food is prepared fresh and the Pho is made from scratch!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The rice noodle dishes are loaded with veggies and are delicious. Great local neighborhood option at a cheap price point."}
{"text":"Updated review: I've been here a handful of times since and everything has been fresh and delicious. My husband had the special noodle soup with wonton, pork, and egg noodles and it was incredible. My beef vermicelli noodles were great as usual. I'm so glad something so good replaced Dragon Fly!"}
{"text":"Do bother coming! Can't get food out. Waited 30 min for a call in that was supposed to be 15-20 minutes. 50 plus in all and no food. Thank heavens for HT. My daughter was hungry."}
{"text":"We love Ipho. My wife loves the yellow pancake and the pho broth is authentic and full of flavor.  Best pho in Charlotte"}
{"text":"This review is strictly about the food. I ordered online and my Boyfriend went and picked it up, as far as service everything was fine.

We ordered summer rolls and Pho. The Pho was ok, the broth was flavorful but more salty than is typical. It was a very large serving but on average was $4 more expensive than the same bowl at many other Vietnamese restaurants in the area.

The summer rolls were the worst I think I've ever had. They were rolled loosely and fell apart after the first bite. The pork was thick and the sauce was not a traditional peanut sauce, instead was a very strange tangy sauce that I could not identify."}
{"text":"Day two in Charlotte... had to find a Pho Restaurant! Guess what???? We found one that has some of the best bone broth tasted in years! I had the N1 and my much better half had the the N10. We also had a yellow pancake... yum! This needs to be on your list to try. I believe that once you've tasted iPho, no others will compare! \"Pho sho\" the best in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Awesome place for Pho, pad Thai and yummy seafood.  Great service, patio with a fountain, all the pho stock is made in house (the owner came by to chat!)"}
{"text":"Recommended. 

Great, fresh, delicious food. I think they are still working through the service kinks but that should come in time. The staff was friendly but I just wish they were slightly more attentive.  

Excited to have iPho in the neighborhood and plan on going back soon!"}
{"text":"This was our very first time visiting iPho.   Staff was extremely helpful in explaining the menu and helping us find the perfect meal.   My wife is pregnant with  cravings all over the place.  Food was delicious.   Our Server was awesome.  Our meals were prepared fast and accurate.  We had a wonderful experience at iPho"}
{"text":"My son and DIL raved about this place...and they were right! First time here while visiting and my DIL brought me for lunch. Delicious Pho Tai and really good Summer Rolls. All ingredients fresh and abundant. Atmosphere very pleasant with helpful servers."}
{"text":"Dragonfly was the best Chinese food in charlotte. iPho is nothing like it. Maybe the Pho is good but the chinese food is not."}
{"text":"After seeing iPho highlighted in Charlotte Magazine as one of the Top 25 new restaurants in the area, my friends & I decided to check it out. Wow, what a find! First of all, the staff was warm and welcoming from the time we walked in. The owner who runs the front of the house spoke with us about her recommendations and told us that everything is made to order and even the broth is made in house (we tried the beef broth and OMG, delicious!) For appetizers, we ordered fried pork dumplings (awesome), firecracker shrimp, and the summer rolls with meatball, which honestly I would never have ordered but the owner recommended them and they were so fresh and delicious I ate two of them! My friends decided to have sake and the owner came back over and gave us an education on sake, how it's made, why some is cloudy and others not; fascinating info. Although we really wanted to try the pho, we decided to go with Shaken Beef (simply divine -- highly recommend) Pad Thai with chicken, and Won Ton soup. The Pad Thai is different from the run-of-the-mill noodle shop Pad Thai I'm used to and infinitely better with its perfectly cooked wide noodles and citrusy flavor, which we were told comes from tamarind. The Won Ton soup is made from their homemade chicken stock as well as fabulously delicious homemade Won tons, like nothing I'd ever eaten before. Everyone in our party was blown away. I can't believe we have a place like this in Charlotte, and I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Newly opened.... maybe these very nice people will get it together soon, I hope so....but for now everything about the place is amateurish. Ordered unsweetened tea, got sweetened. Waiter couldn't understand our wine order without us pointing at the name on the menu.  Friendly but poorly trained waiter then practically ran away when asked to give us a rundown on the menu!  He came back after 5 mins, guess he figured we needed more time.
Food was good enough...nothing outstanding. The Pho was so freaking hot I had to set bites aside on my appetizer plate for a bit & let them cool off before taking a bite. 
Maybe I'll try them again in a couple of months."}
{"text":"I came from Los Angeles a year ago I have been in search of a P'ho restaurant.  I am so pleased to report that I have found in at ipho.  The broth was amazing.  The flavor was the rich amount of spices and not too salty.  The only complaint was for the price, amount of meat was a little small.

The spring rolls were great.  It was crispy and had the right flavor.  

Great place and will come back!!!

BW"}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge pho/Vietnamese fans and were so excited to stumble across this place. We always order take out (which is always promptly ready in 15 minutes) so I can't speak to the dine in experience or service issues others have complained about. The people who have taken and fulfilled our orders have always been very friendly and our orders always accurate. 

We give 10 stars to the enormous and delicious summer rolls. Be sure to get them with pork rather than chicken.  I agree with what others have said that their peanut dipping sauce is lacking something but it's still not bad. 

We also give 10 stars to their AMAZING grilled pork (whether on bahn mi or a vermicelli bowl...heck, we've even ordered it by itself). Super flavorful. 

The pho is the best we've found in the area. Broth is well seasoned, portions good. We always get the pho tai and it does not disappoint. 

The only things that have disappointed thus far have been the spring rolls, which are just rather lackluster; nothing special. I love spring rolls, especially on my vermicelli bowl so this was a downer for me. 

The other reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's a bit pricey. Two entrees plus our appetizer will usually run around $35, which is high for take out and high for Asian food in general. Hasn't stopped us from returning many times though."}
{"text":"Great new find!  Food was delicious, beautifully presented with ample portions. Chicken Chow Fun, Beef Stew and Vegetarian Pho were all wonderful. We were not crazy about our first cocktail and the bartender was incredible and brought us (without asking & N/C) a peach specialty cocktail that was amazing.  Very small place but attractive.  The only drawback was servers were too attentive, felt a little rushed to order.  Overall a wonderful little place, priced very affordably with great food and service.  I highly recommend and will be going back and ordering take-out!"}
{"text":"The chicken Pho is the best of all time!  Grilled chicken is PHO king amazing!  Staff is friendly!  Great patio - pretty cool to sit outside enjoying great food & see traffic passing by.  I'll be here every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Had the Pho soup, it was below average compared to other Vietnamese places in town.  I guess most patrons don't realize the are better and cheaper options.  Charging almost $12 for noodle soup is egregious!!  It should at least be somewhat good.  Other places charge around $9.50.  I guess the figured the can hoodwink people of South Park, Myers park and Dilworth."}
{"text":"Really good, authentic food. Can also make it the way you like it. Mojitos are really tasty."}
{"text":"It's my favorite pho in town and the portion sizes are HUGE! The broth is flavorful and done right. I go here almost once a week since it opened."}
{"text":"Got the pad Thai and fried rice, was not happy with the food. Lacking flavor and texture and color. Each entree was around $12."}
{"text":"An authentic Vietnamese menu, just off the beaten path. Super accommodating staff. They'll make whatever you want and know how make this style of food suitable for your kids."}
{"text":"This has become our new go-to spot when we don't feel like cooking but don't want to spend a ton of money. Casual, nice ambiance for when you want to eat in and also easy to take to go. Their pho soup is where it's at: I had the chow fun once and regretted not getting soup. The staff is very friendly, the owner always makes a point to check on you and see how the food is. If you're looking for quick, reasonably priced and delicious pho in Charlotte, you've found your place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I never give 5 stars. Try it today. You cannot go wrong with anything you order. And this may be the best service in town. Get here as soon as you can. I'm a foodie!"}
{"text":"The pho is sub-par, not very bold or flavorful but its price well exceeds other pho houses in Charlotte. Bahn mi tastes like, as other reviewers mentioned, a BBQ meat sub. The overly saucy pork dominates the sandwich so much in that the vegetables might as well be left out. The saving grace of this establishment from a 2-star rating: their service - decent and attentive, always begging to please. Hopefully they turn things around."}
{"text":"I come here often to get a pho fix in Southpark area. Not as good as some of the hole in the wall places but definitely does the job. 

I appreciate that they actually have a veg based broth because a lot of places do not offer that. Flavor is good and everyone i have recommended to try have liked it. 

Not a fan of their bahm mi sandwiches or spring rolls.

Prices are very good for area they are in. Lunch specials for Pho are about $8."}
{"text":"Thai Ice Tea - Amazing! One of the best I've had. This is how it should taste!!

Summer roll - so so.. Edible, but not a fav. 



I didn't try anything else, so I'm not sure!"}
{"text":"We went intending to dine at Dragonfly (closed) and with new management. iPho is not even close. I have eaten Vietnamese before and this was a real let down. They brought out some fish sauce as a condiment (on the side). That was the worst tasting s*** I have ever put in my mouth. My dinner was shrimp w/ rice. I got maybe 8-10 small shrimp (~1/4 lb.), a huge pile of rice, two cucumber slices and some julienned carrots. Really outrageous for the price. My guest ordered meatballs and got beef slices. Won't be back... missing Dragonfly for sure."}
{"text":"Odd interior and slow service for only two lunch tables. Simple menu, appetizers had options and the steamed dumplings were warm.  Fried rice with chicken is not white meat and heavy on peas.  This entree did come out hot, but getting refills on a drinks was a challenge.  Hard to find on own in a Harris Teeter plaza.  Ambiance needs work, it's not sports bar and the staff wants it to be."}
{"text":"Awesome pho! I loved the beef pho entree and the service was extraordinarily wonderful. The beef broth was tasty and had lots of fresh basil, sprouts and lime. The strong coffee with condensed milk is delicious! We had lunch on the patio and the waiter was very kind and helpful. Fantastic food & reasonable prices! This place is hidden in the Park Rd. shopping center near Harris Teeter off Selwyn so there's ample parking."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious! I must say, I was skeptical when I read previous reviews, however, turned out to be a delicious choice. The service was great. Everyone was so friendly & attentive. But the food! I came with 6 people total, and each of us ordered something different. There were different flavors on each plate, not one dish looked or tasted remotely similar. Plates were passed around because of all the flavor bursting from each plate. Will definitely try this again."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to get pho. Broth was delicious with lots of flavor.  The staff was very nice. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Overall there are better Vietnamese places to try but the items were all at least decent. The restaurant was nice and clean but always is pretty empty... 

The least favorite dish of the night was Com Bo Luc Lac (Shaking Beef) which when done right is so, so good. 

The best dish of the night was the Banh Xeo - Vietnamese Yellow Pancake. This is (or will be) the reason I go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Started with summer rolls that were light and fresh which was surprising considering their large size.  Paired with a Lao beer it was a perfect start.  The beef pho was served in a swimming pool size bowl. Prepare yourself to dive into a symphony of Vietnamese flavor. Broth was beefy and rich. Probably the best I've had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great pho and great staff. I get their Vietnamese egg rolls and rare steak pho as often as possible. Their grilled meat egg rolls are also great! always ask for my beef on the side so I can control how cooked it get. Don't forget to ask for the chili oil for an extra kick!"}
{"text":"Just finished a wonderful dinner at iPho. The food was all very fresh and tasted great. The owner stopped by our table and talked about how the food was prepared. She was super nice and fun to talk to. I highly recommend giving iPho a chance."}
{"text":"First time here, it was kind of hidden near the Harris Teeter but the inside is a cozy size, kind of like a sports bar kind of just an Asian vibe. The menu was medium size but good choices. I got the wings as an appetizer and they were good, nothin special. I also got the Pho with rare beef. The pho was huge, the bowl was enormous for 11 dollars. Not to mention, it was very good and the service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I recently went there for lunch and I was mostly impressed.  I had the vegetable pho.  I have to say that that was probably the most flavorful pho I have ever tasted.  The broth was absolutely superlative in flavor and came with a wide variety and quantity of vegetables.  But as others have said, the prices are a bit steep here compared with other Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte.

My server was great.  I ordered my pho without onions and, sure enough, it came to my table filled to the rim with onions.  I sent it back and the server apologized profusely and sincerely for the mix-up.

The place has a somewhat classy interior and ambiance but it was really marred with two televisions blasting out CNN news at 1:30 PM.  And couldn't they have painted over the really large scuff marks leftover on the booths from when the restaurant was the Dragonfly?

I probably will return, but will do so for dinner since the menu (and the prices!) are the same for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I had the chicken pho and chicken spring roll. The only reason for the 4 was the vegetables (in the vegetarian pho) were from a can or frozen. The broth had great flavor. Next time I'll pass on adding vegetables."}
{"text":"If you love pho you'll like this place. I consider myself a coninsuer of fine pho with an elegant palate. Easy to order quick to eat. Took my girlfriend there to try pho for the first time and she absolutely loves it. I eat there often and I'm super picky so yeah getcha self some pho"}
{"text":"Love this place. I almost always get Pho (the broth is really flavorful - my personal favorite in Charlotte) but have had a few other things on the menu and haven't gone wrong. Everything is always delicious and fresh. The owners and staff are super friendly and really want their customers to have an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood! After recently birthing a baby, I have been cooped up in survival mode. Grateful for DoorDash and iPho teaming up, I was able to try the new establishment from the comfort of my own home, twice.

Each time I ordered my go-to comfort Vietnamese dishes: vegetarian or chicken pho. The soups came hot with all the sides. Both were equally delicious! The broth was flavorful, noodles were perfectly cooked, and fresh vegetables (with the exception of what seemed to be canned mushrooms). Plentiful chicken, white meat.

I look forward to one day stepping foot inside this place and getting the restaurant experience. Until then, I'm happy to get it delivered to my front door."}
{"text":"Not the best pho in Charlotte, but good enough since it's so convenient. Overbearing staff were slightly annoying but well meaning."}
{"text":"The food was really good, however we dined in and the service was not so good.  The waiter went on a rant about how much he hates take-out orders.  Lets just say the food was good but I will not be ordering take out for fear that he will do something bad to my food!"}
{"text":"Really good just opened where dragonfly was. try the fried rice and egg noodles really nice inside and good food"}
{"text":"So we love pho and love trying it at new places. The spring rolls were great, the pork bowl was so cooked it was like bacon and the pho was soooooo cinnamon-y, I couldn't eat much. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I had the pho with beef and brisket and it was great. I added veggies on the side and that made the pho just right.
My co-worker ordered the chicken and rice and his meal looked very good and very healthy.
I will be back for sure to get some of that chicken and rice."}
{"text":"In summary: strangest dining experience ever. 

Food was good, not great. For two people, got the free spring rolls - agree with other reviewer that there was too much fry, not enough substance, but hey, it was free. Pork bahn mi - was fine, not very authentic. Better bahn mis in town. Beef and brisket pho - was good. Not sure if the meat is authentic for pho, but neither my boyfriend nor I ate it after a few bites. 

Service was disorganized and confused. My best guess is that no tables were assigned to any particular waiter, as all three waiters were vying for our table's attention. Each of them took some part of our order. Very eagerly. 

A few quick pointers: 

- don't ask questions about the menu. You'll get way more info than you asked for
- don't order the sake. Until they get in sake glasses, at least. Boyfriend ordered hot sake, got talked out of it by the waiter and settled for cold sake, which was served in a high ball glass like a... Shot? After we had finished eating and declined dessert (I can't emphasize how bizarre this meal was - we just wanted to leave), the waiter brought my boyfriend a glass of hot sake, also in a high ball glass, and held in his hands with a dish rag. He explained that he'd had to microwave the sake as iPho was not equipped with the proper sake heating equipment. The free sake was a nice gesture, but a little late, and way too hot. Didn't even finish it before walking out the door
- don't be surprised to see the staff sitting around at vacant tables or the bar. Apparently this is normal behavior. 

Will we be back? Probably. Casual Asian food right around the corner. Will it be any time soon? Nope."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are great, food is delicious, and staff is very kind. Came here on opening day. I will be back."}
{"text":"Small place, great and friendly service. The food is really good, if you are into spicy, their chili paste is on point. Be warned, it is spicy!"}
{"text":"There are very few things in this world that are better than a steaming bowl of pho on a blustery night; and thank god for iPho! Their pho is some of the best I've ever had!! The broth is extremely flavorful and each element of the dish complements one another. My only complaint is that our service was very poor. It took 45 minutes for our meal to be served and I overheard one server saying they were extremely short staffed. If the service was better I would have been more inclined to give iPho 5 stars because their pho is delicious."}
{"text":"This is exactly the pho i've been searching Charlotte for!  I just moved back from Greensboro, where i was introduced to pho at the best, most authentic restaurant, Pho Hien Vuong.  I've been craving authentic pho for months and i haven't been able to find it anywhere!  all the other restaurants in CLT do a completely different style of pho with lots of fresh veggies, and not the right kind of broth. iPho does it right!!!  their broth is perfect, the chicken (i get Pho Ga) is succulent, and their summer rolls are delicious.  we will definitely be returning and will hopefully become regulars here!"}
{"text":"Delicious Pho & Chicken Curry I agree with everyone probably best in Charlotte,  Just please don't forget the Sriracha sauce when we place to go orders! Maybe leave a few on the counter just in case or something... $40 for two entrées I think you can spare a few sauce packets"}
{"text":"I came here for noodles and only noodles. 

The good: 

1. The staff was super friendly and eager (maybe a bit too over eager - fellt like smothering parents)

2. The noodles were delicious and the broth was delightful.

3. I liked the menu - simple and elegant.

The bad:

1. The broth bowl was insanely too large, that it got annoying. I been to many noodle places, and in my opinion small is better - less water, more flavor. In fact, all the serving sizes are way too Texas Roadhouse huge (yes I rail against excessively large portions).

2. Seriously, the decor is off. Are they trying to be a sports bar that serves pho? It just feels awkward that way. 

3. Seriously, TV playing the best highlights of the SEC from 2015. I like sports, but either turn it on something relevant today or don't turn it on all."}
{"text":"First placed we stopped when evacuating Hurricane Irma. The waiter is phenomenal. Super people person, outgoing, sweet and was very informative as to where we should go while in Charlotte. My husband ordered pho and it was amazing! The broth was perfect and tons of meat and noodles. I ordered canh chua ca and it was decent, nothing to write home about. Very minimal fish and mainly just celery and bean sprout, broth was blah. We ordered a grilled pork roll for appetizer and that was delicious! Huge portion and the pork was marinated perfectly. Our son had fried rice and he was a happy camper! Next time we're in town we'll have to stop by again."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly legit pho in Charlotte!  Coming from California, my expectations were set high and iPho more than delivered. 

Delicious broth, perfectly spiced, quality ingredients. Super friendly service at table or bar.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The pho is soo good! Honestly! They're out of Cali, moved to Charlotte and opened a restaurant with good Vietnamese food. 
I can't speak, rather write about any of their other dishes because I've only ordered the Pho but I s was pleased both time. Mmm mm, tasty!"}
{"text":"The Pho is actually good...once you finally get your food.  After waiting ten minutes to place our drink order, we decided to order all at once.  It's safe to say between our table and the two next to us, we all got some form of what we actually ordered...one item at a time.  It felt more like we were in a comedy show then out for dinner as the staff was just as confused as to what food went to what person."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great Pho, a good environment, and friendly staff...this is the place to be."}
{"text":"My first visit to iPho was a pleasant experience! I was craving for banh xeo (Vietnamese pancake) and they didn't disappoint. The canh chua (sour soup) and ca co (caramelize fish) was good also. The owner came to chat with me and I find her friendly and dedicated to cooking quality Vietnamese dishes."}
{"text":"The only bright spot to our evening was the waiter.  He was eager to please under the worst circumstances.  His partner waiter seemed as if he would rather be any where but there.  Manager was more concerned about grub hub takeouts. We were the only party of 5 when we walked in and there were 3 parties of 2 and they had been served.   Ordered drinks and could only get 1 lemon lychee. Wine was less than bad.  We waited  over an hour after ordering and food came out in sporadically.  I was told the Pho was decent but the rest of us had to go home and make a sandwich.  I really wish the Dragonfly hadn't closed.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good pho - service is attentive and on point.   Great place to pop in for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"The food is great, the staff is friendly, during my visit the owner was out interacting with guests.  Overall I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I LOVE ipho! My husband and I lived in Shanghai for several years and always miss those authentic Asian flavors that were so a part of our lives!! I loved the sticky rice app and the beef brisket pho! Incredible food every time we go!"}
{"text":"Good Vietnamese food and friendly service. We will be coming back for the PHO Bowel challenge."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after a 3 hour drive and it was the first thing I got to eat all morning. 

Had a Tiger beer with their Pho Dac Biet. A perfect combination I would say. 

Their Pho portion is huge. Definitely worth the money. Brisket slices were all neatly trimmed of all fat (I don't mind that fatty part, but it was worth noting). Tripe in it was perfect. Tendon a bit on the chewy side, but very good. Noodles were clumped together and required some work to separate them. Normally this wouldn't be ideal, but I tend to like my noodles slightly on the firm side as oppose to it overcooked, so I didn't mind at all. 

The broth. Ohhh the most important aspect of Pho. It was very very good! Very balanced, beautifully clear, and clean tasting. The chef/cook definitely knows their stuff. 

Also tried their grilled pork Banh mi. Bread was a perfect Vietnamese baguette. Light, crispy, fluffy but dense (doesn't make sense but that's how they should be). Grilled pork was a bit too sweet for my liking but that is just personal preference, so not taking anything away from them. 

This place definitely deserves a visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice, but is definitely a place I want to come again especially for the pho challenge or the family dinners. The food is good, not the greatest, but pretty good for Charlotte's Vietnamese cuisine. What really earns this restaurant a solid 4 stars is the customer service. Even though we had only been once before we were greeted as if we were family and they remembered us wanting to try the banh xeo but they were sold out. Finally got it and it was good but needed more lettuce and more herbs. Also have had the pho. We had two bowls of it and one had a lot more flavor than the other so not exactly sure what happened there."}
{"text":"Really great Pho soup here.     I've been going to the #1 Pho restaurant in Boston, in my opinion,  for 15 years (Pho Pasteur) and have sampled the food at 10 other Pho restaurants in New England.  I know my Pho.  This newish restaurant in Charlotte impressed.  The broth was flavorful and aromatic served with a traditional side of Thai Basil, lime wedge and bean sprouts.  Hints of coriander, nutmeg and something vaguely Indian.  Just the right amount of savory goodness.  The décor was quite comfortable if not a bit formal for my Chinatown Boston tastes.  I liked it though.  The service was just fine.  While the waiter was not Vietnamese, the owners and chefs were.  The owner did come to the table to ask how things were, but I did not feel smothered like other reviewers.  For the first time in a Pho restaurant, I was asked if I wanted to try a red chili pepper garnish that I had never had before.  It was spicy but not burning.  Not Siracha sauce.  The portion was very large for $13.95.  Too large.  There was a huge amount of meat.  It was really super-sized.  Too big for a lunch portion.  I suggested two things to the owner:  
1.  Make other portion options available.  Like small, medium and large.  The response was that they were too new and small to be able to go out and buy new bowls to fit new portion sizes.
2.  Don't charge for the tea.  I think it was only a dollar but it costs the restaurant a penny to serve and one feels like one is someone's home when you are offered a pot of free steaming hot tea.  Didn't get any pushback from that suggestion.  

Let us know if the tea is free when you go there and write your own review.
If you love Pho, then iPho will not disappoint.  Tons of parking too!"}
{"text":"Even during a semi busy Saturday evening the staff is efficient and welcoming. The food was wonderful! Very fresh and full of flavor. Looking forward to returning soon and often. Delicious pho!"}
{"text":"I had an exceptional dinner here!  Matt was warm and  professional and food outstanding!  Not one complaint or criticism.

Word of warning to staff: I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and the service was efficient.  The fresh shrimp rolls was big but filled with too much lettuce.  The fried spring rolls had bits of taro which added a nice flavor.  The pho was average with skimpy amount of meat for the price charged."}
{"text":"Perhaps not the most authentic Vietnamese in town, but that's okay, as the staff makes up for it - they may be the most likely to win an award for \"eager to please\" in this department, and that's a good thing, as a few of the dishes can take a while to come out (a bit of an oddity, as sandwiches and soups shouldn't take that long to put together).

During their grand opening - or if you check in on the Yelp app - they are serving complimentary spring rolls, which are tasty, but could do with a bit less of the crust and some more filling. Still, for a complimentary roll, there is little room to complain.

When it comes to the dishes, they have a nice Banh Mi, though it's not traditional, and instead is more like an American version, loaded with meat (we shared a roasted pork version). Though there were veggies on board, there aren't many, and as such, the crunch you get it minimal. The upside is that the meat is wonderful - but if you are expecting Banh Mi, you might be disappointed. Order it as a meat sub, and you'll be happy.

On to the noodles and it's a different story. Pho was good - we had a chicken, which you can get with either chicken broth or beef broth, and is served with fairly standard accompaniments (interesting tidbit, no greens of any kind - only bean sprouts). 

The Bun Trio was excellent, with fresh-tasting components, and instead of a usual shrimp, served with chicken. It was so large I had to bring some home, an unusual feat for me. But the noodles, both meats and veggies inside were amazing. Good choice here, and perhaps the best we had while there."}
{"text":"Yum!! My friend was craving pho and we decided to go here. It was a first time for the both of us. We got sat by the window. They weren't busy at all. 

We started off with the fried dumplings. They were good and crispy.  I got seafood with udon noodle soup. It was so good and flavorful. I added some chili oil to it as well. I ate the whole thing except for some broth leftover. I would definitely get that again. The service was good. I can't wait to take my hubs here one day."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for me for iPho. We came in mid-week so not crowded and were greeted and seated quickly and in a friendly manner. Not the most authentic ambience so don't come here looking for the Viet date night experience. However, the service was speedy and cheerful despite some other similar restaurants. Food-wise, I ordered my favorite curry noodles with chicken. The curry base was very tasty and would rank it better than some of those on South Blvd, but the chicken was lower as it came off bland and a little rubbery. She got the traditional pho dish which was good but comparable so nothing to specifically come back to unless you're in the area.

The price is a bit higher here though which also stymies it down from 4 stars. I'm guessing due to the location off Park Rd."}
{"text":"Had a lovely meal here. Summer rolls were excellent. The yellow pancake was delicious, large and generously filled w chicken, shrimp & sprouts. Portions were plentiful, food was very good, service was excellent and prices are reasonable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just got home with Pad Thai take-out. It was a watery mess with a yellow hue that disturbingly resembled a certain villain from Sin City. It was strange and inedible. We're not picky eaters and my husband will consume anything, but even he drew the line with this abomination. It's now sitting in the trash along with 30 hard-earned dollars. We're scratching our heads right now and trying to figure out what the heck we're gonna have for dinner."}
{"text":"Meh...wonton soup...the broth ws good but the wonton were doughy tasting so that was unappetizing. The v7 trio with beef was not good at all. The seasoning was weird. The chicken chow fun was bland and they put the noodles on the side when they're supposed to be sauteed in with the chicken and veggies...so the noodles were cold and all stuck together. The only thing that was good was the beef stew. I might go back and try the pho, but I'm not in a rush."}
{"text":"The pho is meh. The rare steak was over done and rubbery. The place felt dirty. My table smelled mildew-y  because I'm sure a damp dirt towel was used to clean off my table. That definitely turned me off and kept me from enjoying the pho. Again The pho is not rare. I've been to many viet restaurants this was in my top 3 worse viet places I've tried"}
{"text":"Went on 2/1 around dinner time. The restaurant was about 70% full so the atmosphere was pretty nice and comfortable. I decided to make the trip after reading an excellent review in the Charlotte agenda. I was seated promptly and the meal was off to a good start. 

Unfortunately everything would go completely downhill from there. It took about 15 minutes to get a drink order in. At that point we were ready to order so I asked if I could go ahead and place our food order. I asked for the bahn mi and my wife asked for another entree with a summer roll appetizer. Our waiter (Oscar) didn't notify us of any issues up until that point. Another 20 minutes and no sign of a refill or the appetizer. During this time Oscar asked us about 4 times if we needed anything else and if were OK. Trying to be polite I repeatedly said we were ok, but after the 3rd time I wanted to say OUR FOOD would be nice. Oscar returns with my entree (bahn mi) and nothing else.... one problem, they ran out of bread and so they brought me the dish on a plate with a ball of rice. Being that bahn mi is a sandwich this is a problem. Oscar said \"I brought to you on a plate to make you feel special\" .... as opposed to bringing it to me on a ______ ? 

At that point I had to leave, I got up and said this is unacceptable. No attempt to \"make it right\" was made and we left. 

What a disappointing visit for a place I really wanted to like. The prices are high  here so service and quality are going to need to be 100%. This was a terrible experience all the way around. 

Sad."}
{"text":"Great tasty menu options!  Fresh and healthy!! Absolutely recommend!  Friendly staff and nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"The Pho was outstanding!  This is a nice little spot off Park Road that was worth the drive.  The Chicken Pho in Beef Broth was great.  I added some extra vegetables which made it extra delicious.  Definitely a must order again!  I have never been able to finish a bowl of Pho since the quantity is so large.  My husband got the shrimp fried rice and he was raving about it.  The spring rolls were just ok, but we probably will pass on those next time around."}
{"text":"First time here and it was pretty good. Decor was nice and staff was pretty friendly! Started off with egg rolls and in my honest opinion it was a little too sweet for me.  The pho was good but the tendon was just a little too hard for me to chew! But I'll come back again"}
{"text":"Great service and great pho! Loved everything we tried (Beef Pho N1 & the shaking beef). We had a wonderful time and iPho will definitely be one of our go to spots from now on!"}
{"text":"I had the pork wonton soup. It looked delicious on the pictures so I wanted to try it, but you know what they say, pictures are deceiving. It was a bit tasteless. They need to add more of the cooked onions and more toppings. Broth needed a bit more salt and the wonton were tasteless. They don't have all the fixing sauces on the table and the only sauces they have is sriracha and Hoisin sauce. The slice pork inside the soup was pretty good. They only bring out a few bean sprouts and two small sliced jalapeños and a mini lime. Service was good. The girl got a laugh when I asked her to eat outside lol. It seem they could cook a good fried rice per what my next door table had. I decided to come here because the food looked good and I was snowed in at the hotel and this was the closest pho place for me. Overall it was ok."}
{"text":"pork bahn mi was delicious, rare beef pho broth was great and plenty to take home! 
summer rolls were good too. Fast and great spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Tofu and Mixed vegetable pho to go and it was delicious! Even better the next day after the jalapeño slices soaked in the broth! I'll be ordering again soon"}
{"text":"They advertise a vegetarian/vegan dish that has a meat garnish. 

I assume they fixed this by now, but it assured me that I should never try it again. 

Really said because it looked good, but there's superior Vietnamese options all over the city now including Lang van, crispy banh mi, viet Thai, Vietnam grille, and CO."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots. I'm addicted to the pho! The Pad Thai is delicious as well. You can't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend, it was her first time trying pho. Pho was really good. Service is A+."}
{"text":"After reading the great reviews and having had iPho bookmarked for several months I recently decided to check it, for the Pho.  Now I will start by saying this was my first visit since iPho moved in, but I had been to the previous restaurant in this location.  So, first impression was definite disappointment. They have not changed anything, including the fact the front door is impossible to open and I think they still have the same sign on the front door giving customers a heads up.  Carpeting and seats/booths are pretty old and it is somewhat dim.  
After being seated I ordered a beer and was told they did not have any of the beers listed on the menu, only one.  I was shocked as was the table next to us. Really? 
As for the food, we ordered a variety of items to start, including the fried spring rolls and chicken and shrimp Vietnamese summer rolls.  Both were good, however, the sauce served with the fried spring rolls was wrong. A mayo based sauce was way too heavy and it reminded me of the shrimp sauce at hibachi restaurants, but no where as good.  I actually asked for some fish sauce which went perfectly.
As for the Pho, definitely the highlight of the night.  Served piping hot in a large bowl with fixings on the side.  I enjoy Pho and this isn't my favorite but definitely hit the spot.
Overall, I had hoped for a better experience and am not sure I would rush back to iPho anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ipho totally can have one star for the cute name and trendy T-shirts. Also, our waitress was super nice. My Pho was ok, not amazing but not bland which chicken pho can be. However, my boyfriend really disliked his pho, when they came by to ask how things were. I said mine was fine and my boyfriend said politely honestly it was kind of flavorless. Mostly because the man asked and we wanted to be honest. We weren't looking for a free meal or to be compensated in any way. However the reason I leave this review was the response by the waiter.... which was WELL, everyone has an opinion don't they?... We were stunned!  We may not have even mentioned it until you asked how it was and then had such an awful response.  Honestly, I will never give this place my business again after responding that. Even an I'm so sorry you didn't enjoy your meal would have been fine. Horrible customer service.  Definitely overpriced for sub par pho and sub-par service."}
{"text":"I've had a couple of things from here and have not been very impressed based on the same type of food at other local Vietnamese spots.  Never heard of mayo on a Bahn Mi sandwich and I wouldn't suggest it lol!  Good service, nice people and a cool atmosphere but a few better options around town if you're a fan of this fare.  Not a food snob or hard to please like some people on here, just know what I like."}
{"text":"Really good food. Freshly made and piping hot. Everything we tried was excellent and a decent price. Servers seemed happy to be there."}
{"text":"Very good service and a great bowl of Pho Ga at this new Vietnamese place on Park Road. I took a seat at the bar because it was quick and I had immediate attention from the bartender.

My huge bowl (vat? bathtub? swimming pool?) of pho arrived not too much later. Terrifically fragrant and rich, deep flavor, lots of richness to it. I did the usual thing, tearing up basil leaves, tossing in some bean sprouts and squeezing the lime. And of course, some sriracha, hoisin and peppers. Stir, stir, stir. And then dive in.

The chicken was perfectly cooked, the noodles were just the right al dente to them and the soup was excellent. Somehow, I ate the entire bowl."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and ordered the pork Báhn Mi and it was absolutely amazing. We also ordered the spring roll and fish sauce, which also were very good. I cannot wait to come back and try the Pho!"}
{"text":"I only tried the chicken pho & unfortunately, it did not taste fresh. The chicken was funky tasting."}
{"text":"We had banh mi with pork and pho. The pho broth was good. Banh mi meats was little bit too salty for my taste but overall it was a good visit."}
{"text":"I love this place! So far I have tried the tofu bahn mi, the pork fresh rolls, and the vermicelli noodle dish that comes with spring rolls and pork. I recently moved across the street and I can't wait to try more. The staff are all super nice and are great at explaining items on the menu. I've been here a handful of times since my review and it has been consistently fantastic! My new favorite is the pad thai with a side of hot chili oil. The staff always remembers us and is always friendly."}
