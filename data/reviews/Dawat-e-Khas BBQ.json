{"text":"Awesome BBQ chicken. The place is decent for sit in but the only down side is they give you disposable plates for eat in. Makes the experience a little poor. We also ordered the Ghosht Korma which was good but only came with 2 peices of meat. The pecies were bigger cuts but still 2 peices of bone meat is very little to be serving."}
{"text":"ATTENTION PLEASE Don't waste your money at this place sorry to say most disgusting food ever I had in my life!!!! So I went there cause of the good yelp review but please don't do this mistake go and read the google reviews.... so I went to this place and ordered one nihari one Haleem and the charga with rice and naans So first of all the nihari doesn't taste like nihari at all!!! Haleem was more a daal  the charga was dry seems like they cooked it in water and just put it as a show on charcoals it doesn't even taste like smoked chicken and naans were raw!!! So next day even putting the food in the fridge it was rotten!!! I should call the health inspector to this place!!! Please don't waste your money the owner was saying it's the best food ever I think he not even taste a proper Pakistani food....First and last time i went I will never recommended"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Yum! A tad bit too spicy (even for desi's) but there's a hell lot of variety. Owners and servers are really nice despite the hella long wait time. Their nihari and all kabobs are amazing... biryani is good too but the chicken legs in their biryani are wayyyy too big so I don't usually order that anymore. My absolute favourite dish would be their boneless chicken though. Gaaaaah."}
{"text":"Food is okay, not overly amazing. They're trying to charge fine dining prices for a place that serves food on disposable plates. Management needs to decide which atmosphere they are trying to provide to their clientele. The chicken was pretty dry which means it's been over cooked. The naans are usually good but stay away from the wet dishes. They're only somewhat good with bbq"}
{"text":"Comme première expérience, très bien. Ils n'ont pas de portion pour une seule personne alors beaucoup de gaspillage pour un voyageur comme moi. Si vous aimez les immersions ethniques totales, vous serez servi à souhait."}
{"text":"Best chicken, Chana, Nihari, went with my family and had a wonderful dinner. It's a self service restaurant with no worries for tip. Friendly atmosphere and nice sitting arrangements. Definitely will go again and again"}
{"text":"weekend hours should be extended to 11.  food is good, place is a fast food joint. it's not really Pakistani style, I think it's more of Afghani.  everything is dry, meaning there's hardly any curry items.  They can easily serve burger with the kababs they make, but that's just an option.  My kids are not a big fan, since they find bariyani, and the yellow rice too dry and not served with some sort of curry.  Haleem is on the menu, but so far I have been here 3 or 4 times, I only  tasted it 1's.  I don't know if it's only on certain days, or when ever I  ask for they are always out, their Charga is like dry roast with very little flavor.  This place isn't also that cheap, so for the limited item on the menu, it isn't much desirable to be here.  on a positive note, their KHEER OMG!! it's amazing. Love that stuff their kheer is what's making me give them 4 stars"}
{"text":"Daawat e khas is located near the Williams pkwy and chingcousy rd. plaza near pertosa drive. Few things I would certainly say that the taste of the food, quantity, quality, and customer service was good. I have seen their way of cooking chicken is totally different than other rotisserie food restaurants. There is huge car parking place in the plaza. However, the sitting arrangement is not very big, but yes its good for kids and family dinner. Yes I am certainly coming back with my family and would recommend others too.."}
{"text":"Used to be a simple but an amazing hole on the wall spot with an incredible recipe for BBQ chicken and other offerings. With increasing demand,  arrogance, and a likely hint greed, the quality of the food has gone down and the price has gone up. Now it's become a perfect recipe for why great restaurants fail."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Loved the taste. Reminds me of back home. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys grilled chicken."}
{"text":"This used to be family favourite chargha place to go  to. In the past couple of years their quality has gone down a bit hence the 3 stars.  Chargha is a chicken grilled on top of charcoals. These guys keep the skin on and give it a nice char which tastes great. The chicken is usually juicy and marinated well. Over the years they have increased the spice level which is not to my liking. The chicken is also severed on a bed of rice which has nice flavouring from the juices of the chicken. The portion of rice has also decreased recently. In spite of that this meal can easily serve about 4 people. The meal also comes with onions dipped in vinegar. As far as the pricing its on the pricier side considering the fact that Brampton is the hub of desi (brown people) food and you can find cheaper alternatives.  I have also tried the kunna ghost (mutton curry) and Naan and was pleased by both the items.  I usually call in advance and place my order for pick up which takes no longer than 15 mins. I really hope these guys in their food quality again!"}
