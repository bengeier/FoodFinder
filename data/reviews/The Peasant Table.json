{"text":"I have eaten here three times.  Each time the food was AMAZING!  Tonight I had the John Dory fish dish which was delicious. We started with the beet and kale salad which was exemplary as well.   Love this location.  Too bad the music they play is so at odds with the ambience and style of the place.  We actually asked for them to take the hard rock music off???  Weird"}
{"text":"Great location in heart of Leslieville, although we had expected more. The space itself was attractive. Our main server was excellent and attentive; the reason for my mediocre review is the food. I ordered the Octopus main which was served in a tomato type stew with sausage.   I've eaten and enjoyed Octopus before, however I did not feel this dish is something anyone would find tasty or worth paying full-price for. It was covered in black char and honestly it is the only thing you could taste. After the waitress asked how are meal was, I politely expressed my disappointment with the dish. She was apologetic and asked me if there was anything else I wanted. At that point I was a bit turned off and had lost my appetite so decided I would hold out for ice cream at Sweet Jesus instead. The chef came out and questioned me as to why I didn't like the dish which was uncomfortable; he did not apologize in any way nor take any accountability but rather belittled me and made me feel bad by telling me that he serves it blackened and tha'ts how it should be cooked. The server did take half-off the cost of the meal. My husband had the deboned fish and chips, I thought it was an interesting take on this tradition dish however it was not served warm and we felt the flavour was sub-par.   I will give this restaurant another chance as we enjoyed the service (the chef being the exception here) and the menu seems interesting (and other reviews are positive) however will tread lightly with what I order in the future."}
{"text":"Bad service can ruin a meal and is inexcusable in a city full of options.  I was here for dinner with a friend and it wasn't very busy,  yet the other two tables were being served while we waited for fifteen minutes without anyone even asking if we wanted a drink.  Eventually my friend asked one of the staff politely if there was someone serving our table and instead of starting with an apology she looked at him with boredom and said, \"Well I can serve you.\"  It put us off and while the food was good it didn't make up for the service which diminished the overall experience.  Our actual server (not the bored one) was new and  her colleagues were not helping her in our case. I had the wild boar meatballs which were very good, my friend had the fish and chips and found rainbow trout not to be the most desirable choice.   Too bad about the service because everything that came out looked delicious."}
{"text":"Solid choice for brunch, excellent and attentive service.  Burger is excellent, smoke salmon benny is great in theory - disappointing in reality (the potato pancake was super tasteless and sogqy from the load of salad on top).  Will go again but will stick to the basics"}
{"text":"Food is good at best.   Started with the octopus starter which had a measly portion of octopus. Instead the dish was loaded with raw celery and carrot. The octopus was also cold and not particularly tasteful.   I had the seafood broth type dish (cannot remember the name)  which did have a lot of seafood in it, although some of it was over cooked. The sauce was very nice. It came with only two small slices of toasted bread so I was still very hungry since the overall portion was quite small.   If you want really good Italian for in the riverside /Leslieville area head to Ascari Enoteca which is excellent and a 10 minute walk up the road."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and had fabulous meal and amazing service!!!! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced for the portion size, and quite honestly, IF the food actually tasted good, the pricing (and/or lack of real portion sizing) could have been overlooked.  However, this isn't a \"great food, will be back\", type of review.  It's a \"never order from here\" unless you want to pay for bland, tasteless small portions of food type of review. Don't bother wasting your money here."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on the weekend.  Not sure if it's because it was relatively new but it was not that busy at noon, which was a bonus for us when most Queen East brunch spots are lined up on a Saturday.  The menu was impressive with some creative brunch selections,  Food was excellent, although I would have liked my eggs hot, not luke warm. I had the Veggie Benedict (grilled tomato, spinach, marinated artichokes, poached eggs, cayenne hollandaise on naan) The home fries were done just the way I like them - flavourful and a little crispy on the edges. My friend had the Salmone Affumicato (atlantic salmon, poached organic duck egg, potato pancake, dill marscapone creme fraiche, baby arugula) Service was excellent.  Will have to try the Mac & Cheese with eggs next time..."}
{"text":"Had meatballs on top of polenta...was quite good.  Walnut gnocchi... is dry and scratches your throat, making you worry you are going to choke to death.  After the taste kicks in, you start to wish you had choked to death.  Had an arugula salad, which was just a mountain of arugula with dressing on it.  It tasted fine, but not really a culinary stretch to put that together.    Had another item, I think it was a Special.... but I would suggest that's a misnomer.    The decor is like every cliche in contemporary dining thrown into one space, and the service ranged from snooty (owner) to deer-in-the-headlights (server).   There are a dozen good restaurants along this little strip of Queen East, no reason at all to visit here."}
{"text":"We came here for Mother's Day since it was the only place with reservations available for 8 people. Quite surprised that the restaurant was not very busy (the old restaurant was always packed on the weekend).  Everyone enjoyed the food, my crepes came to the table barely warm. The rest of the plates were considerably warmer/hot. However, I was a little disappointed that the $6 grapefruit juice was a less than half a small wine glass, it was a bit of a ripoff. The other disappointment was their selection of teas was from Lipton; I had expected a more premuim brand.  It was ok value for the money (except their juice and tea). Not sure if I will come back when there are so many other great options on Queen."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, but this place was worth it.  It wasn't perfect, but has a very \"what you see is what you get\" vibe, and what you see is pretty good.  I recommend one of the pizzas straight out of the wood oven."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago and I'm still thinking about how delicious it was. Service was great, food and wine were fantastic and overall lovely evening! Will be back and telling everyone I know."}
{"text":"The meat and cheese board is not the greatest. Seemed like some leftover ingredients from the kitchen that don't really pair well together and wasn't isn't and bread etc to eat it with. That's the only thing we ate so I can't comment on the rest of the food."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place when the original intended brunch location had a lineup out the door and around the corner. I was pleasantly surprised by the Peasant Table, having never read a Yelp review before. I had a salmon hash thing and my dining guest had the mac and cheese- both were delicious and service was great. Would come back."}
{"text":"A cute little restaurant with the smell of a wood burning fire. The wait staff were knowledgeable and friendly. My son's kid pizza was the same size as a regular pizza but a quarter the price, and delicious. I ordered the duck pappardella and enjoyed it. Steam whistle on tap and nice wine options. Garage doors were open bringing in the Queen Street atmosphere.   It's a family friendly restaurant, yummy and reasonable. Sunday's have no corkage at dinner too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a friend, and was immediately drawn in by the smell of their open flame pizza oven. The aesthetic of the restaurant is lovely, I was surprised that the restaurant was as empty as it was.   The food was delicious, and the service was excellent. Kabriel was very engaging and helpful.   We got the Focaccia, Marinated Mixed Olives and House Pickled Vegetables to start.   I had the Burrata salad, which I would definitely recommend, and my friend had the Tagliata (grilled and sliced Black Angus steak) and she said she thoroughly enjoyed it.   Both meals were very filling, we agreed we would have to return again to check out the dessert menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in here randomly for Sunday brunch with some friends and we're not impressed to say the least. The wait staff was pretty terrible. Maybe they were overwhelmed by the only other table of 6 people. We sat ourselves and had to move the tables around ourselves to accommodate our 2 month old's car seat. We waited 10 minutes for the waitress to come back and serve waters, then another 10 for coffee orders and another 20 till coffees were served. The food was OK, but the breakfast accommodations were mediocre at best. What breakfast place doesn't do over easy eggs? After waiting for an hour for our bill, we had to ask a second time for it to be split between the two couples at the table. 4 hours for brunch is a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"Very hipster place, loved the vibe and the staff. Good took a bit long to arrive even though it was rather empty. Great food though, pizza was probably the least wow, still very good but the burgers are a must!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed as I saw a mouse run by while eating my pizza and upon pointing this out the restaurant didn't do anything about it like pay for the bill !  Given I went out for dinner only to see a mouse was disappointing. Lastly I'd like to add this was the second time I saw it last time was ~ 4 months ago so clearly nothing was done about that issue."}
{"text":"We used to visit this space when it was Table 17. This place has been open since December. Physically, it is a welcoming place, with lots of character in two rooms, the first of which is more of a bar area. The food really surprised us. It was way beyond just good. Our drinks were great, too. The cocktail menu is creative. For appetizers we chose burrata with poached pear (which was my favourite dish of the evening) and the tuna with chutney. Both were outstanding. For mains we chose the carbonara and the gnocchi. Again, both were fabulous. I suspect any and all of their dishes are great, and there is LOTS of choice, from meats to pastas and more. We chose to share the profiteroles for dessert. Again, very good. This place deserves to become a great success! Just go. You won't be disappointed :)))))"}
{"text":"Yummy!  My partner and I stopped in at The Peasant Table to kill some time before an appointment and I am so glad we did! We shared the Bomba pizza and each had a glass of house red ($5!!) and it was the perfect size to share while still leaving us feeling full. Our waitress was in training (wouldn't have known had she not told us) and she was lovely- very friendly and even though new, was very knowledgable of the menu.  Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Coffee was hot and strong...off to a good start. We had the salmon 'sort of' benedict. Loved it. The hollandaise was lovely, with lots of arugula and an amazing potato pancake.  The only negative is the very meat based menu. Not a lot of choices for a vegetarian. But the food and service was great."}
{"text":"After catching my eye on my daily commute, I stopped in here shortly after they opened for dinner.  The food is excellent.  I had the veal and sweetbreads (vitello).  The sweetbreads were generous and not overpowering.  The veal was cooked well and tender.  My girlfriend had the wild boar meatballs.  They were massive!  Cooked slowly all the way through and delicious.  I also had an order of the herbed ciabatta, which was nothing special.  The meals are generous in size given the complexity and ingredients.  At the time they unfortunately did not have a cocktail menu yet, but I'm sure they do now."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, the first time from stumbling across it when it was newly opened; and the second time because I had guests in town visiting and I wanted to bring them somewhere with a nice atmosphere and delicious food. This place is such a treat - mostly everything I have eaten there has been uniquely tasty. In order of deliciousness, here are the menu items I have tried:  1. The burrata with pears and bacon is AMAZING. I wanted it again today, but no one wanted to share and it would have been excessive to eat that much cheese on my own.  2. Fritti (black ink cod fritters) - these were a good sized portion and extremely moist with very little filler batter. Strange looking (black lumps, like coal on a plate), but so so good.  3. Oysters. There are so many places to get oysters around Toronto nowadays, so I eat them fairly often. It's odd that the oysters at this italian pub would stand out to me, but they did - they were a good size both times and the mignonette is a great complement even for someone who usually eats oysters straight up. My one complaint is that I got a bit of shell in my mouth and in presentation half of one of shells was cleaved off so was kind of sharp. So, maybe they need to freshen up their shucking game.  4. Carpaccio. You can pretty much win me over with the addition of truffles every time, so the black truffle crema was probably going to mean I was on board with this app no matter what.  And it delivered.  5. Polenta fries - I love this side option. It's nice to be able to order a carb side that is not french fries but still acts the part in all the good ways, a salty finger food that doesn't ask for a big commitment.  6. sperlani (sea smelts) - I've never eaten smelts before so I have nothing to compare them against, but these tasted not too fishy, salty in a good way, and the portion size was large.  7. wild boar meatballs - in fairness, I ate these on my first trip a few months back, but I figure I would remember more about them if they stood out to me.  8. barbabietola (beet and kale salad) - same deal as #7, ate this on the first trip - I'm sure it was good but it's a standard sort of salad I eat everywhere so i can't recall anything special about it.(Though looking now, the orange thyme dressing doesn't sound like something I would like - but I must have, bc I came away from this restaurant with a 5 star impression)"}
{"text":"We were driving past this restaurant in Leslieville, looking for something to eat and the restaurant's open, relaxed look interested us to give it a go. The place is spacious with lots of seating and had its shutters open which is perfect for summer.   The menu has a good selection and we were quite hungry so decided to go with the fish and chips (kettle chips) and the burger and chips (kettle chips). I liked the kettle chips and thought that was a nice replacement for the traditional fries. The fish is de-boned but not the traditional style fish and chips - it's an actual fish. I liked it but probably not for someone who does not like too fishy of a taste. Burger was good but not great.   Service - the waitress serving us really needed to up her game. We ordered the food and waited about 35-40 mins to get it. The waitress came up to us after 20 mins and instead of telling us why it was taking too long (in a nice way), she came off quite rude and stated that the burger takes about 15 mins so it will be out soon and walked away. We did not get to ask anything.   Overall experience - okay minus the waitress."}
{"text":"This review is for the Northern Italian Pasta tasting event held by Toronto Common here.  For the apps, we the octopus and beef carpaccios were the highlight. Delicious. Next was the squid ink fried cod. I didn't enjoy the polenta fries as they tasted bitter/off to me.  For the pasta, my favourite was the shell pasta with spinach sauce and sundried tomatoes. I found that the squid ink fettuccine tasted like chinese flat egg noodles(?). There was also the pasta with crab (not that much crab in it), and the three meats pasta. Everything was generally tasty.  We were supposed to get the cinnamon pana cotta, but they switched it. Instead it was I think a vanilla one. Wasn't a huge fan of the berry topping, or the pana cotta itself."}
{"text":"Food was really good- I had the squid ink pasta which was delicious and very fresh. Atmosphere is very laid back, perfect for a summer evening. Service was excellent. Very much looking forward to going back again."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  Came here with a group of friends for dinner on a Saturday night. We made a reservation but were seated late due to the party before us taking their sweet time leaving. The staff were very apologetic and friendly though, and since the place isn't very big they didn't have another table we could use.   I ended up getting the surf and turf dinner for two, with a glass of muscat wine. I shared it with another person and it was the perfect portion size. It was super delicious and I highly recommend it. Everything was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. My other menu options were the salads and the arctic char. I think there might have been a couple more items that were a gluten-free option but I didn't ask since I wasn't interested in them. I'm not sure if their pasta or pizza has a gluten-free option as I didn't ask.   The rest of my party ordered a variety of items and each loved their meals too. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. They also had no problems providing separate bills. Overall I have no complaints about this place.  TL;DR - really good food, several gluten-free options"}
{"text":"I came here for the northern Italian tasting   I'm giving this place 2 stars because I found their staff is arrogant and unpleasant.   There's no shortage of good pasta in Toronto. For guests to come back to your restaurant, you better impress them not only with your food but with your service.   We were never greeted properly. All they said was \" you are here for the tasting? Please sit over here\", no smile, no enthusiasm, not welcoming at all.  When food comes, we asked for more description of the food and wine. Again, the reply was just one word, no smile, not pleasant. It's like serving our table is a chore to them. The waiter was completely arrogant, thinking we were inferior by asking him questions and thinking that he was the best thing that happened to the restaurant industry.   Why partner with Toronto Commons for this event if you are going to treat your guests poorly? We,too, paid for the dinner. Some respect would be nice.   I am unlikely to go back. As I've said, there's so many good pasta place in Toronto. Why go out of my way to eat here?!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to having brunch at this place for a long time and finally had the opportunity to do with some friends. It's in one of my favourite parts of the city, which makes it all the more alluring. It's super cute inside. Huge mirrors, sort of rustic charm with the wood. Lovely servers. However, the food itself was a bit of a letdown. It was just okay, that was the consensus at the table. I ordered a bacon caesar to start, which was nice and the veggie benedict to eat. I found the eggs a bit over cooked (very little runny yolk), and I was unusually really full and could not finish my meal. The potatoes were a hit amongst my friends. The coffee had free refills, so if one doesn't hit the spot for you, no worries there!  Overall, I think if I lived in this area, I would come back. There are more options on the menu to try and perhaps the items we got were not their big hits. It definitely seemed popular and I'd like to try out their lunch/dinner menus some times."}
{"text":"Nice spot with an open window to Queen Street.  Just had the cod and a beer. The cod was good, and larger than what I was expecting.  The guys that work there are hott lol"}
{"text":"This food should not have left the kitchen. This was a $90 bill with Uber Eats delivery today!"}
{"text":"Cons: Mac and cheese was about 50 minutes overdone. The portion we received was very bland and sent back. The second time we received the Mac and cheese, it was a completely different dish containing 3 entirety new ingredients and noodles less overcooked. However, it was still mediocre.  We saw other plates being returned to the kitchen as well.   Pros: Decent service, always had a full cup of coffee."}
{"text":"2nd time here was terrible. Last night, for our anniversary. Cod fritters with aioli was beyond bland. No flavour at all except grease.   Also had the meatballs on polenta and hubby had crab linguini.  Neither had much flavour. It's like the meatballs had no garlic or salt. Wtf.   Service was slow. Had to ask a different waitress for more water because ours was too busy not tending to us.  Doubtful we will go back"}
{"text":"Went here with approximately 10 people without reservations. They were able to accommodate us pretty quickly. Service was good and pizza was good too. Would visit again."}
{"text":"My friend said this place used to be called \"Table 11\", but obviously the place doesn't exist no more.  The place and menu look modern.  They have a lot of selections of teas and specialty drinks.  It's a good place to meet up with friends.    As for the food, the meal portions is reasonable and descent, it's filling and it's not an overload.  At first I thought the potions looked small, but everyone walked out satisfied.  I had sloppy Joes and the rabbit meat was delicious and the little arugula salad went well with the meal.  Our server was very accommodating when splitting the check between five people.   Overall great ambiance and place to socialize."}
{"text":"Been here twice, had the burger and beer for $20 twice- so good!!   The fries are excellent, and the burger is filling. And dressed just right! Can't ask for more.   If you're hungry, you won't be after eating this burger!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and the vegetarian option was quite horrible. I would recommend trying one of the many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Went to The Peasants Table on a regular Saturday night, was greeted by welcoming staff who sat me at their lovely bar.  I ordered one of their new wood fired pizzas (the Bomba) and I have to say this is on par or better then any for the thee fancy pizza places on the west side of the city.  The staff also suggested a great red wine to go with it!    Highly recommend checking this place out"}
{"text":"Came in today after our reservation at another restaurant backfired due to a bursted pipe, anyways, walked into a very desert restaurant, I think it was mainly due to the weather. That aside, the atmosphere was amazing, just smelling the woody smell of the wood oven and the small tealight candles at the table made me feel at home, all cozy. Honestly, the sharing plates were sooooo good then our two pizzas were bombastic! Woot! Our waitress was super friendly and checked on us within appropriate time, she made sure we were comfortable and that's a definite plus for me. Our bill came out to be around $76, which isn't so bad, all things considered.  Pros: - Attentive and friendly service - Food was super amazing and delicious - Atmosphere was inviting and cozy - RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"TL;DR burnt food, over an hour wait trash service, drove to mcdonalds after   I rarely leave reviews, the place has to be either amazing or so shitty enough to get me so pissed off to leave a review. This place was the latter. I came with a party of 5 and I got here around 1:45 on a Sunday and we ordered at around 1:50pm. WE GOT OUR FOOD AN HOUR LATER. AT LEAST. My party has dirty glasses and forks that needed to be replaced also....on top of that the waitress didn't even check up on us once during the hour that we were waiting. There's literally like 20 tables here max and only half of them were full. Three of us have experience in a restaurant industry and we get it if some times shit happens but Weve never had a customer wait 1 hour for food and at least we check up on them from time to time, and I get no place is perfect, but idk how this place can't even manage to check up on their customers who are waiting. But anywho the only redeeming quality is the food, specifically the pancakes in the \"house benny\" but it's kind of hard to actually enjoy them when you only get two and they're completely burnt (see photo below). Anywho, if you have an hour to waste and want burnt food be my guest. Some notable mentions were the steak and eggs and the veggie benny (which thank god wasn't burnt) But as a brunch place in Toronto, there's many competitors so they need to step up their game and stop serving burnt things and cut the wait time in. Half. At. Least. And we weren't even told \"bye\" as we left. Note: I downloaded google just to review this and let everyone know not to waste their time"}
{"text":"Came here 3 weeks after opening was very pleasantly surprised... We checked out the menu in the window from the street and a very friendly staff member named Josh came outside and talked us through the menu + explained the 50% off wine Monday and Tuesday if 2 order a 2 course dinner so we were in. Ambiance is so lovely very small country rustic feel I love the contrasting \"hungry\" neon light hanging outside the kitchen! We shared 2 apps... Burratta was amazing and grilled octopus cooked perfectly... My husband had the wild boar as a main very big and hearty just missing some greens, I had the branzino which was perfect. Light with charred cauliflower and rapini so delicious. I have seen the brunch photos and will be back for sure. Such friendly staff very accommodating and so patient and seemed genuinely interested in explaining the food and wine. Great new spot!"}
{"text":"The smell of burning wood hits you as you walk in to the peasant table.  This quaint little restaurant hostess maybe 10 to 20 tables with the historical and unique view.  The menu is very up-to-date with tapas light fare and some main entrées.  I tried half of the appetizers and most of them were amazing.    The cod cakes Brussel sprouts cheeses were highlights of the menu. The stuffed red pepper where is good but lacked a bit of seasoning. The pizzas were phenomenal. Excellent beer choices on top. And a robust wine selection which paired with most meal options.  The dessert and coffee options were excellent. Enjoyed the marscapone cheese cake. And the coffee was made perfectly.  The only reason why they lost the star was to the lack of service. Some of the waitstaff we're not as friendly as others and at times were not very attentive.  I highly recommend this place to most people. Looking forward to coming back here in the summer. Excellent choice for date night."}
{"text":"I had a really really good experience at this restaurant on a Sunday morning for brunch!  I ordered the Mac and cheese for brunch because I'm always craving good comfort food. The Mac and cheese actually blew my mind because it was the perfect amount of cheese and savouriness. This girl finished the entire plate! It was pretty perfect and I would love to go back and eat more.  We ate near the open window and it had he perfect breeze that day. The restaurant is adorable and so cute it's got a great view of the cute neighborhood. The service is also great the guy who served us was genuine and had nice conversations with us"}
{"text":"Would only go here for drinks as the ambience is great.  Food is not very good.  My pizza had to be sent back because it was extremely salty - turns out they had over salted the kale.  When they brought it back it was marginally better but still not tasty.  Was lacking in flavour.  My wife's burger was extremely dry and appetizers were a flavorless let down.  All of this with extremely slow service.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with both the quality of food and service at the Peasant Table. Our server was very familiar with the drink menu and food menu. He checked in on our meal many times to ensure that everything was up to standard. The food was much better than I was expecting. We ordered a bomba pizza, the burrata salad, and Nero di Sepia pasta. I would definitely order both mains again, as they were generous servings and delicious. The Burrata tasted delicious, but I would have liked more Burrata in the salad. I live in the area, and would absolutely return to The Peasant Table."}
{"text":"Because of the reviews and images of the brunch menu, I thought I was going to be wowed. Unfortunately, I found the rosti too oily and crispy and could not even taste the potato. My date had the omelette and they felt it was over cooked and dry. The meals we had tasted like it was cooked the previous day."}
{"text":"I visited Peasant Table for the Northern Italian Pasta tasting event organized by Toronto Common. In my experience, all events held by Toronto Common provide very good value, but I will focus the review on the food here.   We got to taste a mixed appetizer dish, along with all 4 of the pasta dishes featured in the restaurant's menu, and a dessert:  Wagyu beef carpaccio with black truffle crema, rocket (arugula) and parmesan; Black ink cod fritters with smoked paprika aioli; Polenta fries with roasted red pepper salsa; and Octopus carpaccio with dill veloute and pickled vegestables - This was basically 4 appetizers shrunk down in portion size and made into a single dish. I quite liked the fact that I get to taste so much and the portion was perfect and think this should be on the regular menu. The stand-out item was most definitely the beef carpaccio with the truffle crema (delicious!). The other items were okay, it was a great starter nonetheless.  Orecchiette (small shell) pasta with basil pesto, grilled asparagus, semi-dried tomatoes and fresh ricotta - this was the lightest tasting pasta of the night. This is an \"okay\" dish. Personally I prefer pasta with meat/seafood in them but other guests really like the fact that it's clean-tasting and light.  Nero di Sepia: Squid ink fettuccine with grilled calarmari, shrimp, roasted tomatoes, chilli and parsley - I really like the squid ink and the seafood combination. The chef was a bit heavy on the black pepper and that distracted from the taste of the dish. Overall this was an \"okay\" dish as well.  Crab meat carbonara linguini, with pancetta, peppercorn, lemon cream and quail egg - the presentation was perfect with the quail egg on top. This was my favourite dish of the night and I like the creamy pasta and the combination of crab meat & pancetta.  Animale pappardelle pasta, consists of a 3-meat ragu (lamb, pork and veal), porcini and tomato - Most of the group were full at this point including myself, so I had only a bite of this. My impression of the dish is that is a great pasta dish for meat lovers, and I thought the tomato sauce on it was of good quality and tasted \"homemade\". I would rank this as the second-best pasta of the night.  Cinnamon and delce de leche panna cotta with candied orange - I like the smoothness and creaminess of the panna cotta. The candied orange was a nice and interesting touch. Delicious overall and a great end to a meal.  Looking at the prices on the regular menu and considering that the somewhat big portions I received were \"downsized\", I would say the Peasant Table provides very good value with respect to their pasta dishes, which are all under $20.  The restaurant had a nice modern and welcoming vibe and is definitely a great neighbourhood restaurant to have around. The food (at least for the pasta) here will not \"wow\" you, but it's solid, hearty and comforting. Negative reviews centre mostly around brunch, so perhaps that is not their strong suit for now. I would recommend coming here for dinner.  Peasant Table is \"A-Okay\" (3-stars)"}
{"text":"Very Impressed!  Stopped in with girlfriend for drinks and some food.  Great location and ambiance.... and food was fantastic!  Half price wine bottles on Mondays and Tuesday or bring your own with no corkage. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've walked out on a meal, but I did it.  Went for brunch today. Waited 35 minutes for a plate that I wouldn't serve my dog. My friend ordered a veggie dish and asked for her eggs to be cooked so the yolks weren't runny. Yes 35 minutes later, her dish arrived runny and with bacon. The server first blamed the oversight and the wait on the amount of orders - I counted four tables in the whole place. Please. Further, the server then blamed cooking the eggs specially. How long does it take to bake an egg? Clearly 35 minutes and still they got it wrong. We paid for our drinks and left.  If you want to stay in the brunch game, step it up!"}
{"text":"Great food Not just at our table but I saw everything at the other tables look amazing too. Their brunches with hollendaise, the burger on a wood block, gorgeous salads. I had the beet juice, my husband had the juice of the day Mango! Can't wait to come back. I hope they still do $5 prosecco on Thursday cuz I'll be coming for that too!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. We were headed to county general and decided to try it out. We were really happy either whole experience. The happy hour wine was easy to drink and one wed happily pay full price. The food was well crafted. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch in Leslieville is always a treat and this place certainly delivers.   Ordered:  The Salmons affumicato  - Nice texture with a nice crunchy potato pancake with small running duck egg on top. Although I think chicken egg would just be as good.   Sloppy Joes  - Rabbit meat and it taste just like chicken with a nice spicy kick. I tried a bite from it and it was good.   The waitress was super attentive and friendly and definitely a spot to try out to avoid the line ups typically found in the other more popular joints around the area. Overall no complaints but I wouldn't say it's something that really stood out to make me keep coming back again given the slightly steeper prices. They have some unique dishes that's definitely worth a try though."}
{"text":"Food was good but really bad customer service . Waited an hour for the food to arrive . Customers on the other table all got their food but we didn't. Followed up and the server blamed on us for making too much modification and started giving us attitude instead of apologizing !"}
