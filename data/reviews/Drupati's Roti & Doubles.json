{"text":"Always loved the food. Not sure if they know when their operating hours are. The sign on the door is misleading. I can't tell you how many times I roll over there around 7pm (not on Sunday) and the place is dark. :("}
{"text":"If you're travelling to try this place, don't. It's not worth it. $50 for subpar food (2 roti, 1 stew chicken dinner, 2 aloo pie, and 1 bottle of hot sauce). In comparison to other places, this is pretty steep for warmed up food, lousy atmosphere. The music was so loud the girl behind cash couldn't hear my husband ordering. It was listening to Charlie Brown's peoples on the phone (whomp, whomp, whomp) a couple times he had to repeat himself. He couldn't even hear me tell HIM I wanted him to get a curry chicken dinner for my son and a stew dinner for me...lol. Honestly, the server behind cash looked pretty clueless anyway and her child was crawling all over her and between her and the cash register so she could barely see while punching in our order. Then she tried to let us walk away WITHOUT our hot sauce. $50 dollar order and walk away with no hot sauce meanwhile it's on the counter right by our order to be packed? And why are the cooks coming out from the kitchen to pack orders? The girl at cash should packing orders, maybe along with someone else if busy. This is why we almost left our hot sauce. The girl from the kitchen thought we wanted hot sauce in a cup from the squeeze bottle. So between the girl at cash, who heard us ask for our bottle and knew it was there and was going to let the kitchen staff get us squeeze bottle hot sauce, then the girl behind cash comes and says oh hear. Oh boy *rolls eyes*. 

Anyway, on to the food. Too much anise flavour in the goat curry (roti). Dahl roti was the best thing, it was huge but not so much filling. Why such a huge roti for four pieces of boneless chicken and one potato? The flavour of curry was okay. On to the worst, the stew chicken was sweet. Yuck. No balance, pure sugar or ketchup or something. It was no good and we were charged, get this, an extra 50 cents for rice and peas instead of white rice. Really? Why?? Lol. Like seriously? Your food is pricey already. You really need that 50 cents? Most places give rice and peas standard with the food unless you ask for white rice instead, no up charge. Just weird. Y'all got it backwards. 

People standing around in the blaring loud place blocking tables where there is a sign that says don't block this area...lol. Not too much brain matter in this place. Don't go to this location."}
{"text":"Love the doubles, what a bargain, Roti is good too. drive from far to eat here its worth it."}
{"text":"The double was pretty good but the boneless chicken roti was kind of dry. The service was really good but it took a few minutes before we got our menus for dining in. I think I would only come back for the doubles."}
{"text":"When I wanted good roti and doubles I used to drive up to the Drupati's on Albion Road.  I'm told this is their newest location.  It looks like they're working on some renovations but the decor is friendly on the eyes.

Conch roti and a potato and channa roti plus pear drinks.  

OMG the best roti in town PERIOD!!  Perfect roti wrap and right amount of spicy flavourful filling.  Dang it's good!!  Do it when you're in the mood."}
{"text":"Visited Drupatis as I have always wanted to compare their doubles to the ones I had in T&T as well as Island Mix in Vaughan.
The spotty service and look of disorganization had me worried but nonetheless I managed to order the doubles, boneless curry goat with a paratha roti on the side.
The food arrived quickly and was surprised to see the curry goat on a large flat plate rather than in a bowl. This dish became cool rather quickly!! Don't they realize this in the kitchen?!?
The goat itself was dry and I suspect that the boneless goat is reheated and then placed in the curry rather than allowing it to stew, big disappointment. The paratha was fine.
Onto the double. It was a good size and while I prefer my food spicy, I felt they should offer a hotter sauce! Come on you is trini so u mus have peppa sauce!!
Compared to Trinidad, the double needs some work. Compared to Island Mix, it's very similiar.
My recommendation, stick to the double and avoid everything else."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service! Went there as we were starving! Sat ourselves at a table and NOONE came to see us of take our order.   We literally sat for 20 mins and decided to get up and leave.  The waitresses were to busy checking their phones, chit chatting, and loafting behind the cash. 
Will never recommend this disgraceful place to anyone else! They don't even deserve 1 star.

Ps waitresses saw us get up and didnt even care to ask us why or what happened."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. We have ordered shrimp roti and was served some shrimps that was anything but fresh. We sent it back and they gave us some fresh ones. The food was excessively salty. The service was horrible as well...took forever to get the food, in spite of the restaurant being empty. Lastly, we were going to pay with a credit card and found out that they only take cash or debit card. We will never return."}
