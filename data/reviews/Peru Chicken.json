{"text":"Best Peruvian food in Las Vegas. I've been here twice and have no complaints. My husband had the Lomo Saltado and I had the Pollo a La Brass. Delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"I gave Peru Chicken a go yesterday: we ordered a whole chicken with rice and beans and the fried plantains.   I lives the chicken beans and plantains!!  The place is a \"hole in a wall\" at the back of a strip mall off Sahara and Valley View.   Its worth the trip from any part of the valley.   I will be a repeat customer.   The restaurant is small and clean. You'll smell the chicken from the moment you walk in.  Service is prompt and friendly.  Next time I plan on trying some of the other Peruvian specialties like cerviche."}
{"text":"Muy delicioso! I love Latin food and have tried beans from Cuban, to Brazilian, Mexican, Venuezlan, Peruvian.. This place is delicious! The beans are so good here! So is the the chicken!"}
{"text":"We had the good fortune of finding this restaurant within 2 hours of opening. Both food and service were flawless. We had the 1/2 chicken, plantains, beans and fries. The beans were especially delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and the taste is consistently amazing.. had the lomo saltado and the tallarin verde steak and both had great flavors.  The meat is always cooked perfectly.  I love the fact that they serve basmati rice because it's makes a really good combination with the meat and fries.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming and the food comes out pretty quick."}
{"text":"Omg!! The food was amazing the taste was so perfect we all got a lomo saltado and it was delicious I really recommend this place I will be back for sure . Hector was very nice and explain all the dishes. Great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Very good, I needed something different and this was it. I ordered a quarter chicken with beans and rice and everything was amazing. Chicken is so flavorful and juicy. Definitely a win"}
{"text":"Best Peruvian restaurant in Las Vegas. They import the food ingredients from Peru. The service is excellent and the price is super low for a restaurant. Small but quaint. Totally recommend it.  They have two locations."}
{"text":"My favorite little restaurant in Vegas opened a second location.  I follow them on Facebook so I'm here for the Grand Opening!  It's adorable! And Delicious!  Try the Steak with Pesto Pasta!"}
{"text":"Peru Chicken a great place to take lunch. One of my favorite place, I really love it. Everything is fresh. You have to try the ceviche is delicious . Service also is great, with a friendly  staff. You don't waste time neither money. :-)"}
{"text":"Service and food was excellent! They servers were attentively and friendly. We ordered the half chicken plate with fries and salad, the whole chicken plate with rice and beans and the chicharron breakfast plate. The chicken was moist. They also give you the option of ordering dark or white for the chicken. The portions were fairly large and well worth the price, especially compared to the strip. The green sauces (not sure the correct term for them) they give you with the food were so good! We went out of our way as we were staying on the strip but was worth it, I would definitely come back here again during my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"A simple little hole in the wall place serving delicious lomo saltado, Peruvian beans and rice, roast chicken and fried plantains.  Enjoyed everything and will be back for more."}
{"text":"chicken. crack. must stop eating chicken in car b4 I can get it home to family.
Omg.
I just get a chicken and salad and go.
So good, tasty ( what the heck do they do to their chicken??perfectly seasoned and rotisserie till perfectly cooked.)

Not going there for the ambiance, it is all about the chicken."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Peru and this is the Best Peruvian food I've come across in the US..."}
{"text":"Boo...no chicken again so we left to pro kabob in the same center and was super happy with our dinner. I will give it another try next time hopefully you guys will have some chicken."}
{"text":"Yay, Peru Chicken has a new location! It's cleaner, larger, and closer to me. Really hoping this restaurant helps enliven the plaza and attract more businesses. In the mean time, pollo a la brasa and tallarin verde for everyone!

There are a growing number of places to get Peruvian food but  PC does it best- generously seasoned and juicy chicken, thickly-coated green noodles with medium-rare steak (and only $10!), cheap and crispy yucca frita. They also serve breakfast all day.

Service is quick and I really appreciate the upgraded space. One of these days I'll try their famous pumpkin donuts... or the lomo saltado. I tend to stick to the dishes I already know I like here, since they're done so well- on that note, maybe stick to the fried sides instead of rice, beans, and salad. Don't forget the aji!"}
{"text":"Move over KFC! This is another finger licking good place! It makes El Pollo Loco look loca! I agree with the other Yelper...Peru Chicken for President 2016! I can't believe I've been deprived of this delicious South American cuisine! Seriously, this should be on the list of \"Thousand Things to Eat Before You Die\"! Hahaha!

On my recent visit, I made sure it was a Saturday, why? I was told that their green rice (which is made up of lots of cilantro that makes the rice green) is only available on Saturdays. Oh my goodness! If you like cilantro, you will definitely love this rice! I found myself just eating this wonderful rice by itself.

The Peruvian rotisserie chicken is out of this world. Whatever seasoning they put in there makes me want to do the happy dance! Their chicken is always moist and tender. The chicken is no zone condiments for me, although they do offer 2 different green sauces (mild and spicy). The plantains that come as a side is cooked to perfection and quite honestly, it's one of the best plantains I ever had and maybe even prefer these plantains over Jamaican plantains the way it's prepared here.

I ordered the aguadito with chicken, potatoes, carrots, and peas. Wow, this soup was so flavorful I wouldn't mind just sipping the broth. The picarones were really good, but the fruit honey is an acquired taste for me. I couldn't resist not ordering these donut like made with sweet potato and pumpkin.

Peru Chicken has set the new standard for how I like my rotisserie chicken. The staff here is great and their magic number seems to be \"5\" as in ready in five minutes. That's what I call super-duper fast service! This little treasure (in what feels like an abandoned plaza) is tucked away for other locals to see. I'm very happy depending on the day of the week, it's only three miles from my work, but unfortunately they don't offer delivery.

    Peru Chicken, you've earned my 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is a little diamond in the ruff for sure. Located about 10 minutes away from downtown Las Vegas in a shopping mall parking lot you will not find any of the glitz and glam that you will usually expect to see in Las Vegas. Simply put you go here for the delicious food. If you like Peruvian food or have a desire to try it you will not be disappointed. The menu is simple - baked Peruvian chicken with either rice, fries and frijoles or a basic salad for a main course. That's it. There are also a variety of appetizers including ceviche which is excellent if you have a taste for raw fish. The atmosphere is friendly - local Hispanic/South American and the food is simply delicious. If you want to try a cuisine that is savory and different then you need to add this to your list. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very good food
Friendly helpful service
Chicken is very good and juicy.
Steak better than many other south American places in town.
Good rice.
Only negative is the vacant feeling strip mall - puts a negative vibe on driving up - plenty of parking is the upside."}
{"text":"Authentic Peruvian food so delicious I wish I could've ate the whole menu.....reminds me of my mom and aunts food....made me miss PERU.  So much flavor once the food hit the table it smelled like home.  I will be back over and over again.  Been in Vegas  4yrs and this is my  #1 favorite place finally am awesome food place....thank you to the staff for an awesome experience and reminding me of home"}
{"text":"After eating delicious Peruvian food on a weekend in Miami I came back home to Vegas to find some pollo Saltado.  This place had great reviews and not too far from my office so I think this is going to be my new lunch spot! Homemade sauces yummy food and friendly staff.  Very good but Miami was a little better so 4 stars :)"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Staff is friendly, however the jalea is way over priced $25 and to be honest it wasn't the best I've tried. Their yellow sauce can be a little thicker but over all the food is way better than Lima limon."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE! the food is so great i personally love their lomo saltado and tallarino saltado de pollo. They are very attentive and nice they have a friendly atmosphere. I was a customer since their first restaurant i like that this one is bigger im glad they kept the good quality in the food and have good prices. This is the best place for peruvian food."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty chicken. I wish the chicken was a bit meatier but nevertheless great flavor. Not a fan of the rice but the purple corn juice was amazing!"}
{"text":"Love their food! Everything was delicious and well cooked. They do catering as well which was great! I had ordered a bunch of food for my employees as a thanksgiving dinner, and everyone loved the food. It was amazing. The employees there are very helpful as well and very kind. I strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great place to go to for Peruvian food and especially for the \"Pollo a la Brasa\" it's fresh and at a great price!

Pros:
-Great prices
-great food and portion sizes
-Clean restaurant 
-The have great specials during the week which includes a drink , appetizer and entre!
- 2 locations 

Cons
-more options in the menu"}
{"text":"Amazingly priced dinner. We ate for under $30 with a tip and have leftovers. I highly recommend this place and will come back when on this side of town. We had the full chicken, rice, beans, tamal, and purple drink. So glad I came here! Super friendly staff and service."}
{"text":"Excellent service and a wonderful meal. Saved some space for desert and it was worth it."}
{"text":"The chicken was just okay. I was expecting a more authentic flavor. I rather have a chicken from Walmart or Sam's Club."}
{"text":"Not bad Peruvian food. Been here only once and ordered the lomo, which was good. The rice, however, was just okay, which is why I deducted once star (I compare everything to my Lita's rice). I'll definitely go here again and the rating may change depending on future experiences. Wish they had aroz con pollo (if they do, I didn't see it), but they have a nice variety. 

Love seeing more Peruvian restaurants around town."}
{"text":"Quick service and great food. Had the chicken for lunch and was very tasty. The ceviche was was great as well. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great tasting chicken! I got my 8 year old a half chicken plate & ordered myself 1/2 chicken al a carte due to diet. The green sauce is amazing! I could eat the whole bottle! Perfectly compliments the chicken. My child loved the fries. The salad was super simple but so good. I love the homemade dressing they use. Reminds me of my grandma's salads & that's a very good thing. 1/2 chicken ended up being way too much for us. It heated up nicely & was still very moist the next day. I would love to try the soup next time. Oh....& try the Inca soda. It tastes like a big red in my opinion. It's very good!"}
{"text":"I love not having to drive to the east side for Peru Chicken, but most importantly, I just love, love, love Peru Chicken! I wish this fantastic pollería would open shops all over Las Vegas. Peru Chicken for president!

If you want to try authentic Peruvian rotisserie chicken, the famous pollo a la brasa, go to Peru Chicken. This new location features the same menu and a larger seating area than the original, with several booths for dining in. I only come here for the side dishes, but everything comes out of the fryer deliciously crispy and non-greasy. Even the simple side salad is flavorful with a red wine vinaigrette. Most sides are only $2, so skip all those fast food places and come straight here. A fast food drive thru isn't going to give you ají verde, yellow sauce, and white sauce with your French fries, so you'd be missing out. Drink the refreshing chicha morada.

Don't skip dessert, either. Traditional picarones, pumpkin doughnuts studded with anise seeds, are soaked in a brown sugar syrup that's also perfect for dipping fried sweet plantains. I'll bet it's even better a la mode, with a scoop of exotic lúcuma ice cream. Additionally, they make flan and leche quemada. You won't find any liquor at Peru Chicken, but one of the highlights about this new location is that Herbs & Rye is right across the street. I'll be stopping there before or after my Peruvian feast for the best pisco sour in the city; I have it all planned out."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here! Fresh chicken and tasty beans and rice.  Clean cute hole in the wall perfect for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This somewhat hidden Peruvian joint has a certain mastery over chicken that I haven't seen anywhere else. Very friendly man at the counter, they've been around for a while. It's a great establishment to get a feel for the Hispanic community in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have never actually eaten Peruvian food from a restaurant. The chicken here was dry. It was flavorful tho. The beans were bland. Service was quick and friendly"}
{"text":"La comida muy buena ,fresco y sabor casero , el pollo a la brasa fresco y jugoso,y la chicha ni se diga  lo preparan ahí mismo se siente el sabor ,he comido en varios restaurantes peruanos en las vegas y ninguno me ha gustado, yo soy mexicana y mi esposo peruano pero nos gusta probar diferentes tipos de comida ."}
{"text":"Everytime i come to Vegas this is my MUST come! I dont care if my friends want to come or not! I am coming no matter what! 

Here the reviews:

*Ambience: place is small and nothing fancy but who cares if the food is good!

*Service: 10+ points!

*Food:
I have literally tried 90% of their entire menu!
Yes! I get greedy when i come to this place but before we didn't have a peruvian restaurant in Hawaii, so it was my only chance to get this food! 
Plus I ABSOLUTELY LOVE their prices! 
You will be good with anything you order from here but my top recommendations are:
-Ceviche ($10.95)
-1/2 pollo con papas ($6.50)
-Lomo saltado ($10.95)

Overall i will come back every single day i am in Vegas!

{"text":"I've had way better! Their rice was disgusting. Tasted like those cheap rice out of a box. Their rotisserie  chicken wasn't memorable. Nice people , nice service but the food just didn't cut."}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting at all! Chicken was ok but honestly I've had better in NJ. Good portions were served but the food lack taste. We ordered Pollo a la braza con papas y ensalada, lomo saltado montado, bistec a lo pobre, yuca a la huancaina with a side of white rice. We honestly ate it out of hunger! My husband hated the lomo and barely este it at all. We were never told they used extra long rice instead of the typical and usual regular white rice. The only thing we all liked was the green hot sauce. Next time we go back to Vegas we'll know not to come back here."}
{"text":"Really enjoying coming here. My Godmother is Peruvian and this place comes as close to authentic Peruvian than any other places out in Vegas"}
{"text":"All their food is really good. I been here 3x and their staff is very friendly and are very helpful. Every time I come here I have to get a flan after my meal and is really good. After every meal here I'm left very satisfied and go home happy. Thank you for the good food and great experience
Before I forget Alejandra was awesome with a smile that brightens anyone's day."}
{"text":"This review is for the food and service. The food here authentic Peruvian food. I have been here at least 15 times and have never been dissapointed. The service is wonderful as well. The owners are wonderfully friendly and accomodate my son who is vegan whenever he comes with us. 
We typically take the food to go so I can not comment on the dining room other than to say it is very small. Maybe about 6 tables."}
{"text":"The chicken has great seasoning, the beans are flavored well, long grain rice is authentic. The sauces are great. Good selection of drinks, too. All around it very good delicious place to eat."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch with coworkers. This has to be the fastest restaurant ever! We ordered and less than 10 minutes later our food was out. All the food was fresh and good. Everyone was satisfied with their food. The service was great! I'll definitely be back again.  The prices are good!"}
{"text":"So.. Let me clarify this.. The food is great owners are amazing and respectful.. But the service is HORRIBLE!  The attitude of this cashier girl is unbelievable disrespectful she has no manners whatsoever she serves u like she is giving u the food for FREE!! U need to be prepare to leave 5+ dollar tip or they will give u the eye and the face... U can be there sitting for a while nd they know u r there they see u waiting but... They just decide to keep chatting and or using their cellphone instead..!! So bad... 
Every single waiter that works on this location are horrible..! So i wouldn't recommend this place just because .. The food maybe great but the experience make it looks and taste bad.. Really bad.."}
{"text":"Very moist and flavorful chicken, one of the best I've had. Sides were okay and service was okay. They kept just looking at me and made me stand at the counter for 3 minutes before they took my order. Portion sizes were great for the price!"}
{"text":"This place was great, small locale, very clean and fast service. 

We tried:
Pollo saltado and tallarín saltado de pollo. 
The seasoning and salt were right on. 
Usually some of the dishes can come off salty. 
Because of the soy sauce.   The chicken pieces were tasty and the mix of veggies was spot on. 
Tried the chicha morada and mayucaba. 

Will be a definite come back place. 
The AJÍ was nicely  balanced just the right kick and taste. 

Next time I will try the rotisserie chicken. Maybe tonight? Lol"}
{"text":"I'm no expert in fast, casual Peruvian, but I really love this place! After a hard week of working out, I needed something semi-healthy for dinner and ended up in this place. Their chicken is so moist and delicious. It's probably the only chicken I've ever gotten where I eat the actual meat first and don't just pick at it for the skin (the skin is also delicious, extremely flavorful, and well-seasoned though). After eating here, I found myself days after still craving the Yuquitas a la Huancaina (fried yuca root with huancaina sauce)... they have a ton of other amazing sauces they provide (i.e. the crack sauce everyone loves), but I especially liked dipping other foods in the huancaina sauce. The Maracuya (passion fruit juice) is worth an order, although I did see a lot of folks ordering the inca kola as well. The fries that come with the chicken are crispy and the salad, although very basic lettuce/tomatoes/cucumber with a vinaigrette, goes really well with the chicken. I'm not sure what people expect that are disappointed with the salad - It's a lot of amazing food at a very low cost. We have gotten the picarones for dessert as well, but wasn't a big fan of the fruit honey. Looking forward to trying the other desserts though!"}
{"text":"We drive across town from North Las Vegas almost weekly to Peru Chicken. Our family favorites are the chicken, lomo saltado and ceviche. The place is always full and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not the best Peruvian chicken place I've been to, but definitely would go back. The fries were kind of meh, the salad was basically a waste. But the chicken was very good, served fresh. Place was clean, service fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of amazing. The chicken is cooked to perfection and the ceviche is out of this world. Check it out. Great little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they have this new location.. I literally live right across the street, so awesome! We always used to go to the Tropicana location which was 15-20 minutes from our house.. There food is so delicious, I live with a family of 5 so we always get the full chicken and its sides. My dad is from Peru that's why we're so addicted to the food!! I totally recommend it to anyone in the area.."}
{"text":"This place is a 5 stars and 5 diamonds in food and customer service!!! The owner of this place is a hard working lady with a full knowledge in peruvian food !! The cheff JONNY CAYETANO have a degree from the LE CORDON BLEU!! A very popular culinary school, if you are a peruvian like my self come to this place with out of doubt !!!!! Also at front as service is OTY a very nice girl with full knowledge of the menu, i been in all vegas peruvians restaurants and none have the bests like PERU CHICKEN!!! I love it, also prices are very affordable, portion very decent, if you want to spend some nice time and enjoy the food just go there , ohhhh don't forget the arroz con pollo every Saturday my favorite!! Anticuchos ohh la la . Even if you go by your self call carlos in the back and he will come out to make you a nice conversation so you will not feel alone LOL . TO ALL MY PAISANOS AND FRIENDS I WILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!! Enjoy."}
{"text":"I love good Peruvian food and Peru Chicken didn't disappoint... Flavorful and tender chicken, tasty spicy green sauce, and delicious pinto beans. I keep coming back, ( doesn't hurt that's it also very healthy)."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! The sauces for the fries were excellent and the rotisserie chicken and sauteed steak had great flavor."}
{"text":"Very tasty food. I ordered the whole chicken to share with 2 other people as well as a side of rice and beans. The flavor was really good and they have very good home made sauces that you can add. If I was in this area of town more often, I'd eat here all the time."}
{"text":"I was on a Peruvian kick this past week and decided to check out another Peruvian restaurant. I came anticipating a larger menu, but this place is fast casual and just has a few dishes in addition to the roasted chicken. Since I had lomo saltado just a few days ago, I opted for tacu-tacu con bistec here, and also got chicha morada as a drink. I ordered my food to-go.

The restaurant is not big if you plan to dine in, but it wasn't too crowded. Service was prompt and attentive, though the employees seemed very invested in a football (i.e. soccer) game that was playing on TV. Decor is basic.

The food was reasonably priced and tasty, but I kind of like the other Peruvian place I went to that gave you free soup. Nonetheless, this is a solid Peruvian place for a quick meal and I recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Why you should come here?

Cause you're a winner, and you feel like having a tasty chicken dinner

Where is it located?

Sahara and Valley View, across from Herbs and Rye

What you should order?

DUH!? PERU CHICKEN!!! aka Pollo a la Brasa with Rice and Beans, and ask for some Aji Verde to enjoy with your meal. That stuff is ADDICTING! 1/4 Chicken is plentiful so you could try other stuff...If you like Ceviche, they do it well here. Dessert wise, we only tried the flan which was a little on the dense/overdone side. People rave about the Picarones, but one day I'll get around to trying them...ALOHA!!!

{"text":"I have been here several times and it is delicious every time.  The rotisserie chicken is very tasty and perfectly cooked.  The lomo saltado is one of my favorites and it is also very good.  This place is small with limited seating and a limited menu, but the food is very good."}
{"text":"I was so excited to discover a Peruvian chicken spot in Vegas. Located in the middle of a random strip mall, Peru Chicken has some of my favorite classic Peruvian dishes. My go to plate is the lomo saltado because I can never get enough of that tender sauteed beef with rice and fries. They also have pollo versions of the dish. I'm also pretty impressed by their ceviche appetizer, which is large enough to share. The shrimp and fish were great and it also included some sweet potato and large-kernel variety of choclo corn. Best of all, they have three different homemade sauces at table side, one of which is spicy. I've been hearing a lot about their pumpkin doughnuts, which I'll have to get around to trying one of these days."}
{"text":"Peru Chicken is the best Peruvian restaurant in Las Vegas.  The food is super delicious and authentic.  Service is excellent and the prices are more than fair.  The place is immaculate.  Do yourself a favor and try this hidden gem out."}

{"text":"Love this place, food is so good, I usually get the whole chicken, red beans and rice, it is amazing"}
{"text":"Service: the guy made sure we were okay more than 3x 
Food ordered: 
Lomo saltado, it was good, beef wasn't chewy, good flavor
Doughnut,  it was good but sauce not so much for my taste, try it with the green sauce it is much better
Steak and rice: beef wasn't chewy, it had just black pepper taste and nothing special
Inca cola: kind of tasted like bubble gum

Overall, it was okay.  
Return visit: yes"}
{"text":"Peru Chicken - Las Vegas, NV

Peru Chicken is not just good, their rotisserie chicken is really, really good.  Peru Chicken might just be my favorite place for rotisserie chicken in Las Vegas.  Each chicken meal comes with a side, but ordering a la carte is an option too.  Price for a half chicken is only $6 and it's more than enough food to keep me happy for a few hours.  The chicken is seasoned to perfection, very tasty, big on meat, and simply delicious.  I have also tried other items on their menu, including their sautéed beef and even a side of hotdogs.  You can't go wrong with those dishes too.  But if you ask me, it's all about their chicken.  

The restaurant is located off Sahara and can easily be missed if you're not specifically looking for it.  There's one TV and it's usually set on ESPN Deportes.  The restaurant is small and the staff is as nice as can be.  Bottom line...you get a lot of good food for your money at Peru Chicken.  I highly recommend this place for breakfast, lunch, and dinner."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place from the TVs playing Peruvian TV to the no-nonsense utensils and decor. What's important here is the food, and it shows. Generous portions, fresh cooked and super tasty. We ordered the whole chicken, rice and beans (most delish beans I've had in ages), a large side of fries and a steak plate with rice, fries, plantains and an egg. Just a hair over $30 for everything. We were raving fans before we even made it through the parking lot and back to the car. Great option for a reasonably priced, hot, yummy meal for passing through travelers off the 15 like ourselves."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! I'm originally from L.A., Cali. I'm use to the rotisserie Peruvian chicken from El Pollo Inka, if anyone is familiar! I Always compare my Peruvian food to theres, this chicken was upto par! Delicious, juicy and moist! Prices and portions are great!! Found my next favorite hot spot in vegas!!"}
{"text":"La comida riquísima como siempre, pero las meseras tienen que aprender a escuchar lo que uno de cliente ordena envéz de servir lo que ellas \"suponen\" que uno quiere..."}
{"text":"If you want outstanding chicken cooked to perfect juicy perfection and seasoned perfectly, this is the spot. Their other dishes are outstanding as well, but their chicken rivals five star \"on the strip\" restaurants at a fraction of the cost. And the service is warm like you're an old friend."}
{"text":"The only decent Peruvian restaurant in Las Vegas. Ive tried other places but this place is the best tasting. Is super cheap, super delicious, big portions. I really hope they can affiliate with Uber eats so I can order for delivery. My favorite dish is the Lomo saltado, chicken tamal and their rotisserie chicken with the yellow sauce."}
{"text":"I'm just saying. In my opinion this is hands down the best rotisserie chicken in las vegas. ZERO COMPETITION!!! Do Not  be fooled by the possible unappetizing decor that may turn some people off!  This place is legit... I ordered a half chicken w/ beans and rice for $9. Not only is their chicken amazing but they probably have the best beans I've ever had. I hope it's this good every time and not just a honeymoon  reaction because I'm in love!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall restaurant for some good Peruvian food. It's a smaller restaurant but still nice to dine in. 

Servers were very friendly. I wasn't too familiar with Peruvian food but the service was very helpful with that. 

The rotisserie chicken is awesome especially with aji verde sauce! It's only around $6 for half of a chicken. Don't forget to add that with your meal. Tried the flan too but it was a little bit more on the firm texture."}
{"text":"Great food. If you're looking for a new taste this is the place. Plantano Fritos are delicious and I like dipping them in this yellow sauce they have. Beans are beautifully cooked and seasoned. DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Buenisimo
Ayer probamos el desayuno peruano (chicharron camote y tamal) picarones y helado de lucuma.
Todo estaba increiblemente delicioso!!!"}
{"text":"A Peruvian friend suggested this place for lunch. You HAVE to eat the chicken with the sauces. The flavors just dance in your mouth! The mix of spices gets soaked deep into the meat so every bite is as flavorful as the first, though the skin is still the best part! If you've never had purple corn, try the purple corn drink. Very interesting flavor."}
{"text":"Yuquitas a la Huancaina ($6): Fried yucca root with Huancaina sauce. If you love fries, you'll love yucca fries. A little more starch, great flavor, and delicious with the sauce. 

Pollo con Arroz y Frijoles ($16.50): Whole rotisserie chicken with rice and beans. This is what you're coming for, the chicken. Peru's version of rotisserie chicken is bursting with flavor and spices. IT IS GOOD. Really, really good. Delicious, moist, and serious poultry perfection. The best deal is the whole chicken which you can share or save for another meal (or meals). I love getting the rice and beans, but there are options for salad, fries, etc. Typically, it comes with long-grain white rice (very fragrant; think Jasmine rice), however, on Saturdays, you get Arroz Verde. Y-E-S. You want the beautiful, tasty green rice. Also, their Frijoles is made with canary beans - delish!

Lomo Saltado ($10): Beef or chicken sauteed with onions, tomatoes, and fries; served with long-grain white rice. One of the most popular Peruvian dishes and for good reason. It's one of the original fusion dishes, influenced by Chinese settlers' saute technique and use of soy sauce. It is delicious and super fragrant. Also, do you need another reason to eat fries?

Arroz Chaufa ($9): Beef or chicken fried rice. Another Peruvian-Chinese dish and just as delicious as Lomo Saltado. I really don't know which one I like better. Basically the same idea, except there's eggs and no tomatoes or fries. Might be one of the best fried rice dishes I've ever had; no shortage of flavor anywhere.

Papas Fritas ($2): Good ol' fries. These are delicious and you have the amazing sauces to accompany them! I must get these on the side, all the time.

I'm a huuuuuge fan of this spot. The food is insanely good and I seriously can't get enough! And one of these days, I'll finally leave room for dessert. LOL."}

{"text":"I used to really like eating here. The food tastes good and is cheap. I came a week ago and got my food to go because I was in a hurry and ate the food at home later on. The next morning I was sick with food poisoning. I was sick for about 7 days and had to miss all my regular activities for a week, go to the Dr and get antibiotics. The Dr. said that the restaurant most likely didn't  prepare the food properly. So because of this, I won't be coming back. :("}

{"text":"Was craving really good chicken on our Vegas trip and wasn't really feeling Korean fried chicken this time. We found this place on Yelp and decided to check it out. 

It's a small hole in the wall type space. They have a shared parking lot and it's huge so parking is no problem. They do accept card which is awesome. They offer take out and dine in. We chose to eat at the restaurant. The service was good. 

We ordered the half chicken plate with rice and beans. And the steak with potato and pesto linguine. The food is so delicious! We were offered two spicy sauces. The green one is awesome and has a good kick. The yellow is tasty as well and more mild if you don't enjoy too much spice. Their chicken is seasoned very well and cooked to perfection. Their beans are also super yummy. I don't know what kind they are but I loved them! The pesto was hearty and good as well. A little too heavy to eat all of it. Steak is cooked the way you
Like it. 

They also offer breakfast all day options and a variety of non alcoholic beverages. It's too bad I don't live in Vegas because I would definitely frequent this spot if I did."}
{"text":"The pollo a la brasa is delicious. It's steamy hot and the skin is crispy. The service is friendly and ver fast. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat for couples and family's! The food is delicious it's a little hole in the wall but food is awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Peruvian food, and it did not disappoint. Everything was seasoned so well and they give u really big portions. I had 1/4 chicken , salad, and fries. I also tried the anticuchos sliced beef heart. Amazing! I will definitely go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"First time here.  I tried the 1/4 chicken with rice and beans ($6.50).  Everything was delicious.  The food tasted freshly made and was perfectly done.  The meal was served with three different home-made sauces.  Also, the place was extremely neat and clean!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good food not bad at all for the price. El sabor muy bueno, platos de buen tamaño y el precio muy cómodo... se los recomiendo"}
{"text":"Excellent little Peruvian joint we were so happy to discover. Chicken was delicious and the Pan con Chicharron (fried pork sandwich) was out of this world. My hubby is Peruvian and pretty picky about his Peruvian food and LOVED everything we tried. Excited to come back!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the whole chicken with platanos. Was really good. Friendly service and helpful."}
{"text":"As far as chicken goes this place is better than any fried chicken I've ever had. Previous Yelpers got this one right. Service was top notch and Hector knew his business. Outstanding service. We had the whole chicken with Rice and fries and a side of beans. Chicken (Even the white meat) was very moist and marinated to the bone. The 3 different sauces that come to the table complimented each other well. The dark green sauce had a nice kick to it. I didn't think about the 112 degree day outside after eating it but that's what AC is for. The Rice was just steamed but had a very nice quality to it. It mixed in well with the Beans that were very good. The beans were creamy and well seasoned. I love beans so they were right up my alley. I don't give 5 stars easily so you know this place is legit. I will definitely be back. But not soon enough. Don't let the drive off the Strip or the questionable appearance of the Neighborhood deter you from this Gem.  I've been traveling to Vegas for years and every time I do I get a suggestion from the Bellhop or Valet who usually have very good suggestions."}
{"text":"First off thank the moon and the stars that we now have Peruvian Chicken and as a bonus; it's on the west side of the valley!! 
It's funny that Peruvian food was one of the ethnic cuisines that the valley has been lacking. I'd usually have to wait till I head to the DC or Miami to get my fix. 

By default I ordered a 1/2 chicken w/ fries and a salad. 

The yellow aji sauce was a little runny however was still delicious. 
The green aji had the right consistency and nice spicy kick! This was what I used to accompany my chicken and papas The one reason why I had to 3 star this place was due to the sad salad that came with my chicken. It totally was dead.. Yellow chunks and withered soggy lettuce. I didn't make a stink about it as I came hear for the Chicken and crack sauce. 
This place is not Sardis but it will satisfy the craving for now."}
