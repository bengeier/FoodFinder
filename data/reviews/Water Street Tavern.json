{"text":"Not much to look at, but if you are looking for an easy going bar with a $2 happy hour everyday from 2-9pm. Tavern is the place to go."}
{"text":"I have been to water several times and will not be going back again now. My tip would be get just bottled beers here because I thought it'd be fun to get the fish bowl, big mistake. The fishbowl is just pure sugar and juices, you cannot taste the alcohol because there is very little alcohol in it. Idk if the bartender made it wrong or what? But half the fishbowl was pure grenadine and then he began pouring the \"mix\" of alcohol, he says. So if you want to spend $15 for pure juice have at it, but otherwise stick with the easy stuff. The manager did talk to me about the situation and did offer me another drink instead, but at this point I just wanted my money back and he said that wasn't possible. So now I just won't be going back."}
{"text":"Water Street Tavern is two faced....older crowd early on, mellow and there for Jazz  Tuesday night. Wednesday is Blues, Friday usually Rock.  Later in the evening usually a younger crowd and music to match.  It's a bar with bar food not special, good happy hour deals and characters.  Not so much a college bar as a multi- generation easy going bar.  Never struck me as a meat market, try it out maybe you will enjoy !"}
{"text":"The only reason my fiancé and I enjoyed ourselves is because of the company we went with...we all sat on the 2nd floor patio, which was self-serve from the 1st floor bar (the patio bar opened as we were leaving). The bartenders were absolutely the least friendly people we've ever encountered. They barely spoke to us when we ordered and had an attitude like we shouldn't have been there...we were lucky to even catch their attention to order a beer. Also, the only \"college atmosphere\" the bartenders had was that of a community college dropout..."}
{"text":"Solid college bar almost always people there the bouncer is good so no underage kids there to ruin the mood drinks are high priced but what do you expect all around it's worth a visit here and there but wouldn't make it my regular bar"}
{"text":"This bar has potential but the service is bad and the drinks are extremely watered down. All the bouncers have roid rage and are dickheads. Someone call Patrick Swayze from Roundhouse because this bar is in desperate need of new bouncers who are a little more professional."}
{"text":"At the bar tonight, the bartender spilled an entire punch bowl on a customer and then after said customer tried multiple times to ask for another one politely, he was forcibly kicked out. I think it's messed up that a bartender, who spilled the drink, didn't replace said drink and instead of compensating for his mistake, he kicked the guy out by force. One of the bar backs grabbed him from behind and literally threw him out. Unprofessional and uncalled for. The customer was totally calm, I was standing right next to him. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Just a quick one.  Road trip to Kent to see what we could see.  Just your average \"I live in Youngstown, so need to travel\" kind of things.  Bar was dead on the afternoon we went, the wifey and I, and we was thirsty and hungry.  After some reflection on the choices, went with Water Street Tavern.  Was not disappointed at all.  Bonus, it is attached to Mr. Zubs subs (see their reviews on Yelp) who serve really great sammys and assorted what not subs and such.  AND...  a rooftop patio.  Was a perfect day for it, had a couple of 2 dollar Labatt 16 oz drafts, and a pretty good reuben (wife had a something-or-other that she said was good) from Zub's.  Zubs is worth a trip, nice menu.  And a few vegan options that did tempt me.  I do like me some sprouts and cukes every now and then, and Zub's menu had those options as well as meat type stuff.  Was good.  Left happy.  Am going to search out this place again when they have their bands on Wednesday and Friday.  Looks like a good time.  And Downtown Kent Ohio is definitely worth the drive.  I would go out of my way to come here if I lived in Pitt or Cleveland.  On a festival night, or whatever.  So, not just the bar, and the sandwich, but a really nice park and walking environment.  A lot better than I remember it being ten years ago..."}
{"text":"Pack a bunch of bros on the prowl and add expensive shit drinks. You have to watch yo self girl! But can be fun with large groups. ..college bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW how cool the ginger a** of a bouncer must think he is for being a complete d*** for no reason.   The first experience I had with this bouncer was when I was sitting at a table and he asked for our ID's. I gave it to him with no problem and continued to talk to my friends/family since he so rudely interrupted. In a very aggressive rude manner told me to \"look me in the eyes\". Dude I'm sitting there with my parents enjoying my sisters graduation celebration.. no need to be rude. I get it's your job but seriously no need to be a prick about it. Not how you should be treating customers who are spending money to pay for your subpar hourly job.   Then, he told me to leave for literally no reason! Standing by the door with my parents getting ready to leave when we ran into a friend. This prick of a bouncer overheard my PERSONAL conversation and then came over to me in my face and said \"miss do we have a problem\" as I proceeded to tell him \"no we don't\" he told me I had to leave. I called him an a** hat after that (he deserved it).   After reading the reviews the morning after I am not even slightly surprised these are the types of people they have working here.   Thank god my sister is graduated and I never have to come back and see that loser of a bouncer again.   On a side note I was there the night before and had a GREAT experience with the couple bartenders working there. Very attentive and friendly. GINGER BOUNCER TAKE SOME NOTES YOU A** HAT!!  Sincerely, The Twat"}
{"text":"I'm so torn about Water Street Tavern.  They have some of the best happy hour specials in Kent.  And Cajun Dave's is nestled inside and serves up some delicious food.  But this place is like a magnet for DBs of both the male and female variety.  For me, dealing with that type of crowd isn't worth the cheap drinks or good food.  The earlier in the evening you go to Water Street, the safer you are.  Go right around dinner time and you're golden.  In fact, you'll probably want to start your Kent bar crawl here.  They have a $2 happy hour until 9pm every single day.  Most mixed drinks are only $2 as are most domestics.  That's cheaper than every other bar in the area.  The bartenders are definitely on the snobby side.  They represent their traditional clientele well.  This can be an issue when they ignore you to chat with their friends at the other end of the bar.  That's fine, just don't expect me to tip you.  The huge bonus at Water Street is Cajun Dave's.  You can't get Cajun Dave's without going into Water Street, so you may not even know it exists.  But it's good.  Options range from jambalaya to pizza to po boys.  I've never had something off their menu that I didn't like.  Not culinary genius, of course, but good nonetheless.  So go early, get tipsy, eat some delicious fries, and get the hell out before the place becomes DB central.  Trust me, it's better that way."}
{"text":"I liked this place for the drinks but not the wings.  I have heard that the rest of the food there is really good.  The staff is very friendly and you get a smile as you walk in the door.  (They card everyone as you come in the door)."}
{"text":"I hadn't been back to Kent in over two years.  Even though downtown looks much different, this place hasn't changed one bit since my college days.  We were there for less than two minutes and already some guy at the bar was getting dragged out BY THE NECK by a bouncer.  Who the hell drags a guy out by his neck?  The bouncer had a good 100 lbs on this poor guy.  To say that we had a bad taste in our mouths was an understatement.  Unfortunately my friend had already bought us a round so we chugged as fast as we could and got out of there.  Go here if you are into vibe killing.  Go here if you want to get mean mugged by patrons and staff.  Go here if a 100 to 1 bro to ho ratio is your scene.  Don't forget your North Face, bro!"}
{"text":"The bouncers at this bar all have a masculinity macho man complex. I once watched a bouncer slam a kids face into the pavement, knocking him unconscious and broke his front teeth out of his skull. The reason? He tried to dance with a girl who had some sort of sexual relationship with one of the bouncers. It was a Tuesday night and there were at best fifteen people in the bar. I proceeded to freak out and tell them what they did was totally uncalled for and I hoped he would be fired. The bouncer then pretended to jerk off in my face. (I am a woman) Needless to say we called the police and filed a report. Dont go to this bar to support frat boys with power complexes please and thank you."}
{"text":"Rude staff.  Horrible customer service                             We're here for the Octoberfest. Came in for a few beers.  Absolutely shocked by the obnoxious bartender. Love Kent.  Will never return to the Water street Tavern.    Gave 1 star because the air conditioning worked"}
{"text":"God, I hate this bar.   I don't want to, honest. But damn, I can't help it.   First, getting in with an out of state or international ID is impossible. A friend from Puerto Rico got her United States issued government ID taken to the office by management, bent, cut, then returned after an hour, and still told she could not enter. There's a difference between being firm and being a jerk.   Now, supposing you get in, the place is always packed with the most bro bros who have ever bro-ed and the female types who hang out with them. This bar is the most College filled with those who haven't outgrown the fantasy that Animal House sold them.   There are two bars on the main floor, but good luck getting to either one of them. If you try to go to the smaller one in the back, you'll no doubt get elbowed by some girl in a 21st Birthday sash and crown while she grinds on a man indifferent to her presence. If you stand at the main bar, you'll wait. And wait. And wait. I've never seen a group of bartenders both constantly moving and completely ambivalent to their patrons. I had a bartender ignore me for 15 minutes, ask my drink, make four other people's drinks, people who just got to the bar, then ask me to remind him what my drink was before not giving me my change for another five minutes after producing my weak as hell drink.   This bar has absolutely no chill, and the one star I give it is for the fact that they take pictures of people who come to the bar and post it on their Facebook."}
{"text":"Bartenders and bouncers are aggressive and pushy. Very rude, enjoy swearing at customers"}
{"text":"A middle-of-the-road bar in Kent.  While you'd expect this bar to host college students exclusively, I found quite a few people who were in their 40s and 50s.  While it was one of the larger bars in Kent, this place was packed.  It took me 5-10 minutes to get drinks, which appeared to be the norm.  The bartender was a bitch towards me, probably because she couldn't hear me: the place can get quite loud.  I remember beer prices to be nothing out of the ordinary for Downtown Kent.  Cajun Dave's is the restaurant that is here, although I cannot comment on how their food is.  They also have bands playing frequently.  We were there the night an 80s cover band was there, and I left impressed with that band.  Yes, I realize that some 80s songs are easy to cover, but the songs sung by the male vocalist were superb (they had a vocalist of each gender, and it was clear which one was the stronger of the two).  My friend said they were an in-house band or something like that.  The music on the televisions was blaring incredibly loud when bands weren't performing.  If they quieted the televisions down slightly, this would be a much easier bar to talk to people in.  Overall, not a bad bar.  I've visited much worse bars during my time."}
{"text":"Water Street Tavern is my favorite bar in Kent! The music is always good and they have a lot of space on the main floor as well as an outdoor patio. Drink prices are moderate for the area. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is your stereotypical college bar. While I like all of the people who work there he's the real deal about this place:  First, the bouncer might as well be a federal judge. They will be investigating your ID (especially if it's out state) like Trump with a middle eastern visa. I'm 27 and they called the cops on my out of state ID in the middle of winter. So I had to endure the bitter cold blast of Kent until they arrived.   Next, getting to the bar is like pushing your way to the front of a group of teenage girls at a Justin Bieber concert. PRO TIP: if you are a girl, never let your boyfriend go to get the drinks... it's takes men at the water street tavern an average of 45 minutes longer than girls to get a drink (see attached excel file containing data...jk)  Then, when it's time to pee... ugh. You will have to push past giant groups of friends screaming their conversations to one another. Next, when you enter the soaking wet, two-stall bathroom, both stalls will be out of toilet paper and there will be a drunk girl balling her eyes out. Fortunately however, there will be another drunk girl who totally loves your outfit and wants to be BFF. You might be able to convince her to barge into the men's bathroom and ask for some TP.   But--- the people who work there are pretty nice and when it's not crowded (say on a Wednesday at noon) it's not too terrible."}
{"text":"I'm just commenting so I get put on the plastic cups!! #bestideaever      Excuse the spaces, my comment above was too short"}
{"text":"Good happy hour prices on a long list of beers and liquors. Lots of subs and sides at reasonable prices. Live music on some nights."}
{"text":"Instead of acknowledging a mistake they lie about the whole incident. I was sitting with my sister at the bar with our $20 when another patron started trouble next thing i know the bouncer had me pushed against the door. Like i was a ghost and he can go right threw me to remove the other person I'm not. Then i bring it up to them and they lied and said i refused to stop drinking after 2am ummm I was already home at that time and have documented proof. My sister and I did nothing wrong yet you tried to belittle us for sitting us we spoke to the person you had an issue with but that was to be friendly. I have a bad hip and to be pushed against a wall aggressively for something that was none of my business is wrong and instead of being acknowledged being told that it was disrespectful  (i sat with my sister, took a selfie, and peed) if that is disrespect then I've been living wrong. If you have cameras I INVITE you to check them and see the horrendous lie you tried to tell to make your bar look good. GET BETTER BOUNCERS. This is Kent Ohio not LA or NYC get your head out your ass. Then you state that I was hanging out in the bathroom, NO 1. There was a line I had to pee 2. I had to pee and there was line 3. When you there is a line to be you generally wait in the bathroom. I waited my turn and went but why is my bathroom habits your concern maybe i had to shit. I only peed if you most know."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon while waiting for a friends band to play a block over.  Wanted some food and beers.  The food ya order at the counter and is pretty good and filling.  The hot dog was almost too much meat.   Ron Jeremy would be jealous.  The teeny boppers a table over got uncomfortable when I stared at them while I ate it...once they did that I focused on the bartender dude...I cant tell this wasnt his first rodeo and he cheered me on with his eyes and cold stare.  Beers and shots were so cheap we thought it was a joke.  Now mind you, this is a college town, on a Saturday afternoon so they would rather sell some liquor, discounted,  than none at all I figure.  I obliged them and took full advantage of the 2.00 shots and bottled domestics.  I could see getting in trouble in this place for sure.  Reading the other reviews, I think the people working were cool and laid back...almost too laid back though.  And the only macho person in there was me, besides that brief time Danny Trejo was on the TV...   VIVA LA WATER STREET TAVERN AND CARNE GRANDE!!"}
{"text":"Wow I hate hate hate to give one star. You can check my profile for confirmation. Chubby brunette  is THE WORST server I have had the displeasure of encountering In the past few years. It appears this bar has trouble beyond said staff member but if they anticipate to improve their standings getting rid of her would be the start of their solution. I'll let the other reviews speaks for their downfalls because I don't care to raise my blood pressure but stay away."}
{"text":"June 8th we get there at 3:55. I peaked in and asked the bartender what time they opened. She said 4:00. Ok I said is that bar time or real time and she said real time. Hello??!!!  You won't let us in 5 minutes early?"}
{"text":"Asked for a beer on tap and a Manhattan. Beer was 100% dead flat and warm. I was told that they couldn't make a Manhattan because they didn't have the ingredients.   You are a bar without vermouth & bitters, without cold, carbonated beer? I can't understand. Really.   Warm beer and no mixed drinks. Sigh.   The reasoning, \"We're a college bar.\"   Lesson learned."}
{"text":"By far the best happy hour in Kent and the nicest bartenders! They have a great rooftop patio with heaters which is key ;) This place has fun signature drinks and great music, it's nice that they play it at a volume where you can actually have a conversation with people. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a good time."}
{"text":"Came here today for a drink after my brother's graduation and the bartender was one of the rudest people I've ever had \"serve\" me. They have relatively good prices and the cafe inside is cool, but obviously customer service is no priority. He gave one-word, rude answers to our couple of questions, didn't say anything when we told him to keep the tip (over 20%, zero which was deserved), and acted like doing his job was a huge nuisance with probably 12 people in the whole bar. Bartending is a SERVICE business. I'll be choosing other local bars in the future."}
{"text":"This is a great place in Kent to catch a live band and enjoy a crowd older than the average college student.  I have never tried the food here - or I guess it's actually Cajun Dave's.  It does get crowded but you can create a makeshift dance floor anywhere in the bar!  They really do book some good local bands and it's worth a stop in!!"}
