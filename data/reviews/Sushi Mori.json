{"text":"We went here on a whim for DINNEr since had craving for Korean food, and we wanted a different choice since didn't have a good experience with 2 of the other Korean restaurants in First Markham, and boy were we delighted to have stumbled across this place!  The bento box was huge!  Tempura was really fresh! Bibimbap was tasty! We ordered a Hawaiian roll with mango, avocado and pineapple, ...and didn't know it was going to be so big.  Could've done without, as it ended being too much food since meals came with Korean side dishes, ampnd miso soup.  Free dessert of peanut cookies, which we were too full to finish!  We will definitely go back again!  Service was awesome too!"}
{"text":"I visited Canada for the first time during the weekend to see my long time best friend who recently moved up there. We were going to visit a different restaurant my friend recommended but ended up eating here. We've been to literally tons of different sushi places together: from all-you-can-eat to some of the most expensive places. And always thought you can never go wrong with sushi. Well you actually can...  Salmon has been my lifetime favorite sushi so I definately went with that. It had some kinda spicy sauce in it which had a strange smell and a bit of too much end taste. My friend tried it and she disliked it as well. They explained that it was some sorta owner's special recipe. It definately needs an improvement if you want to call it special. Service and the price were decent but not good enough to cover the funky taste I had."}
{"text":"Great place to grab either Japanese or some Korean food. Me and my girlfriend come here all the time. The quality of the sushi is good for it's price, if you are looking for high quality then try another place. Service is very good."}
{"text":"It was not bad food. The service was off. I ordered one thing and got the other, it was my lunch time so I didn't ask to bring me what I actually ordered and just ate what I got since I didn't want to take a risk of being late to work. Also the waitress never ask whether my party and I wanted separate bills and just brought us one bill, which is not good service."}
{"text":"The starting dishes were a bit non traditional, with broccoli, kimchi, somewhat soggy and cold Korean pancake, cold pasta, and cold mango. We ordered the seafood tofu soup, the bibimbap with brown rice and the Treasure Island roll because they no longer had any soft shell crabs for the spider roll. The tofu soup was pretty good, but personally, I thought it was a bit salty and could be spicier. The bibimbap was alright - the bowl wasn't hot enough to create the burnt rice effect XP the manager is very nice though - she gave us a free side dish to try after she got something wrong with our order. Seating here is passably comfortable because a bulky stove prevents you from stretching out your legs. Service was okay - quick, but this is not a place to come for it's environment. We came on a Saturday night and the restaurant was not even half full."}
{"text":"In the midst of First Markham Place is this nice, mid-range Japanese restaurant that serves fresh sushi, sashimi and authentic Korean food.    This location is used to be Est West, a fine Korean restaurant that served one of the best, if not the best, bibimbap in Markham.  I heard that Sushi Mori still served bibimbap, so we dropped by lunch time to satisfy our bibimbap craving.  The restaurant was not busy which was a shame.  We ordered from the lunch menu a sushi bento ($10) and from the regular menu a bibimbap ($9).  Not that it mattered to me that the bibimbap was not in the lunch menu because the regular dinner price was so affordable anyway.    Six little Korean side dishes arrived first.  They were delicious.  The bibimbap arrived next.  It presented nicely.  I tested taste it and found the rice not the same high quality sushi rice that Est West used.  It might still be sushi rice, but it was not the Est West quality.  The rest of the ingredients were about the same. I added in my usual potent mix of kimchi and Korean chili sauce and, wha-la, my bibimbap was ready.  I missed the nice sushi rice, though.  The surprise of the day was the lunch sushi bento.  It consisted of 9 pieces of nigiri sushi and 6 pieces of California maki sushi.  The portion was big for $10.  This could be a dinner size order in other restaurants.  The sushi was beautifully presented in a round bento box (I added a picture in the gallery for your viewing).  The nigiri sushi tasted delightfully fresh; the maki rolls were yummy and sweet. They were just the way I liked it.  I must comment on the wasabi which packed a good punch of hotness.  I heart this sushi bento.  Sushi Mori is a competent non-AYCE Japanese restaurant in Markham.  It is not too expensive even for dinner.  I recommend it, and I will return for more fresh fish."}
{"text":"The takoyaki was delightful. Our rolls were very fresh. Pleasant service. Gorgeous washrooms. Would go again."}
{"text":"Sushi mori is a very underrated place. This is my go to restaurant for sushi because the sashimi is always fresh and portions are huge!   We usually order the dinner kalbi bentos ($15.99) and uni sushi. Everything comes with salad, miso soup, side dishes and homemade cookies for dessert!  The staff are very friendly here and are not hesitant to refill our side dishes (unlike some places). I haven't tried their Korean food yet, will save that for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Food is not bad but not something spectacular. For the price, I expected a little bit more. If you need a quick bite and there's nothing else around, this place will do. Lucky for you, there are plenty of places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"Possibly the highest quality in the Yonge/Eg area. Green tea, miso soup, salmon, ginger, sushi rice all are fresh and delicious. I mention green tea and ginger because some sushi places serve hot water as green tea and almost-rancid ginger, but not Sushi Mori. The price at Sushi Mori is a little higher than the other places, but the quality of the food makes up for it. Definitely not for you if you prefer large portions of AYCE Sushi (which also means lower quality with more rice, mayonnaise, etc), but if you want to savour reasonably-sized portions, this place is a must-try."}
{"text":"If food is your only concern I believe Mori has the best sushi around the Yonge and Eglinton area. Unfortunately there is more to consider when rating a restaurant and Mori leaves room for improvement.   The good: The food The decor (mostly)  The bad: The ambiance (bright lighting, loud TVs) Costumer service (may very) Price  It seems they are conflicted with trying to be trendy and a sports bar. For the price I would expect a more sophisticated experience, not loud TVs blasting random reality shows. One was playing a show with animals getting operations at the vet. Blood and guts included. Yum! If this place is to survive it needs to enhance their customer service and in restaurant experience. The food is there. The rest is holding you back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the red dragon roll with spicy tuna but nigiri sushi and miso soup should be better than that."}
{"text":"Back again to Sushi Mori.. but not for Sannakji..  But my meal was a lot better than last time!!  Dinner set with Sashimi/California Roll and Bulgogi ($15.99) - Everything so fresh and the portion is huge - love the selection of fish which includes Salmon, Tuna, Octopus, Yellowtail, Tobiki, Surf Clams... - Bulgogi, served on a sizzling plate, has nice delicate flavour!   Spicy Seafood Noodle ($10.99) - One of the best selection of seafood, even scallops!! - Noodles though was a little overcooked... but still delicious  Thanks for the complimentary hand roll from the nice sushi chef I talked to last time.  They even gave us 10% off because their credit/debit terminals were not working."}
{"text":"Entered at 1pm on a Thursday.  Three tables seated.  Lots of dirty, uncleared tables should have been a giveaway.  Took 15 minutes to get menu, another 15 to order and another 45 to get mediocre food.  There were six employees in restaurant but they were so disorganized, lazy, slow that the few customers present were all grumbling.  This sushi restaurant has no fresh fish displayed.  Most prep is done in the back.  The sushi was very \"wet\" - saucy and soupy.  The waitress did not know how to use their own computer.    As we got up to leave, one last item we had ordered an hour earlier arrived.  Took them another 10 minutes to pack it to go.  Just a disaster.  Until they get their act together, avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Sushi Mori has good sushi, and good Korean food. In comparison you can compare it to GAL's Sushi down the street with similar prices and food with a little extra. The service was A+ there was always a eager waitress ready to help and answer questions. The location is never packed tho and I dont understand why as it is just as good as Gal's sushi but without all the people and the atmosphere is pretty nice as well. Definitely worth a try for any Gal Sushi lover but hate the wait and packed restaurant."}
