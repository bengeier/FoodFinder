{"text":"Ah, Lake County. If Cleveland is Manhattan, then surely you are its New Jersey. I guess that's what I like about you. I'm not a Manhattan-type of person. Grew up in the 'burbs, I currently live in the 'burbs, and my favorite movie is The Burbs. (Man, that Tom Hanks. Is there anything he can't do?)  This underappreciated gem of the NEO brewing scene is a pretty solid go-to spot when you find yourself stalking the streets of historic downtown Willoughby hungry for a fix. The beers are nothing short of terrific. Peanut Butter Cup Coffee Porter? Didn't even know her! And so on and so forth."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer, ended up staying for their $5 Happy Hour. I guess they have live music every Wednesday night, might give that a shot as well. The staff is friendly and the food is great. I really was only planning on one beer now I am 3 deep with a full belly. (5 Stars)"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. On a snowy saturday we decided to venture somewhere we had never been. Arrived about 1 pm to a nearly empty restaurant. Neat building cool bar with the train overhead. We both started with the blonde and were pleased. I agree rather limited beer list other than the 5-6 self brewed choices. Started with the appetizer platter. The egg rolls were very good with the buffalo dip being better than the sweet and sour dip. The quesadilla was nice with the large chunks of chicken breast meat. Nice addition was the sweet corn. Added great flavor and texture. The hit of the plate was the soft and delicate pretzel. Best I ever had. Dipping sauces were ok. We ended with pizza. Nice crisp char on the edge of the crust but the middle was soft and lacked character. Sauce was good but the chef was a little heavy handed with the dried herbs. Overpowered what would have been a pretty good pie.  I would go again but now know to avoid evenings and the local cougars."}
{"text":"Food 5 of 5, service 3, beer 3. veggie pizza was amazing, poured pork was great, beer choices were weak and ipa was only ok. Server bright the wrong food and was a bit slow including empty glasses multiple times, but seemed nice. Would go back, but eat dinner at the bar."}
{"text":"This place didn't wow me, but I suppose it serves its purpose. The building is massive, so it is very spacious. You have many options: sit at the bar or at high tables (both of which over look the brewing equipment) or sit in the restaurant style tables at the opposite end of the building. Atmosphere is very urban, with exposed metal and dark wood.   Beers were meh. I ordered the fruit beer because I was looking for low alcohol content, as it was 1pm Easter weekend and I was with my in-laws. It was way too sweet. My only other low alcohol option was a blonde ale, which I generally dislike. My husband ordered the IPA, which was decent. All in all, the beers were just average, but they were cheap.  We didn't order much food, just the appetizer sampler. For $14 I was expecting much more. It seemed like greasy, typical beer food, but I suppose that is to be expected at a brewery.   Don't get me wrong, I love beer, breweries, brewpubs, gastropubs, etc. My husband is a home-brewer, studying to be a professional brewer. I also have two Goose Island brewers in my family. Therefore, I've been to many a beer-joint and this place lacked pizazz."}
{"text":"They want to make this great high end food and it just doesn't work. The food is ok. If you take in to account the price it is not worth it."}
{"text":"Called to see the wait on a Saturday night and was actually offered a reservation which was great but that's where the good service stopped.    When we arrived we were sat way in the back behind a large party. It took 15 minutes and us going up to the host stand to get a waitress to get us drinks.  The host offered no apology and still 3 minutes later a waitress finally took our order.  No less than 10 seconds after that another waitress asked if we had been helped. There obviously was no communication between the staff.   When our food finally arrived the burger was overcooked and the fries were old.  For 2 people without having to wait for the table it still took an hour to finish."}
{"text":"I've been coming to WBC since its early days. It's helped anchor downtown Willoughby's reboot in the last two decades.   I'm not a real craft brew guy, but I like the peanut butter coffee porter. The razz is nice if you're in the mood for something a little lighter.   It's a full service restaurant in addition to a brewery. I've always liked the food, though the menu seems to have evolved over the years to feature more pub grub and comfort food over standard dinner entrees (I miss the amber glazed salmon).   Anyhow, I recommend a trip to Willoughby and a stop at the Brewing Co."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a relatively late lunch a few weeks ago and started off with several beer samplers and the appetizer sampler. It came with chicken quesadillas (really good), buffalo chicken egg rolls (surprisingly good) and a pretzel (just good). The dipping sauces were great. Even for as hungry as we were, we should have stopped with the appetizer. Out of all of the beer, the stand out to me was the PB Cup Porter. I'm not typically a porter fan, and I wouldn't want to down a whole one myself, but the flavor was smooth and really quite outstanding. The Southern Cali pizza was quite tasty, unfortunately, I think we were already feeling some ill effects from the ap. (Couldn't possibly have been all the beer, right?) I never got sick, but my stomach was upset for several hours after and we were only able to eat half the pizza. The leftovers ended up being thrown out, based on the suspicion that it may cause more stomachy grossness. Bummer."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Try to park in public parking because it's very close. The valet is not necessary. Inside, all of the tables are high tops, which is hard for short people (me!) but there are some combo table/booths which offer a step for us vertically challenged.  Appetizers: The poutine was subpar, and it turned the fries mushy. I usually love poutine, and this could have been done much better. I did like the flavor of the pork and gravy. The pretzel appetizer and dipping sauces were incredible! PBCCP caramel sauce for the pretzels is a must-try! I want that in a churro!   Mains: I ordered the burger medium but it came out well. The meat was rather tough. The tomato on the burger was supposed to be \"marinated,\" but tasted really sour. The bacon jam was also sour. I ordered a side for my fries because I was expecting it to taste like a thicker version of the bacon sauce at Red Robin, but it did not deliver.  The side of fries I received with my burger was crisp on the outside, providing a wonderful \"crunch.\" The house BBQ sauce is yummy--sweet and tangy.   Miscellaneous: The service was quick and non-invasive, and the waitress even brought us a decanter of water (I always appreciate this!). The portions are generous, and the rest of my party loved what they ordered. I will try it again."}
{"text":"If you like seasonal beers I highly recommend their own pumpkin ale. It is very smooth and you can definitely taste the pumpkin spice. It's got a 6.1% alcohol content. It's one of the best pumpkin beers I've had."}
{"text":"Very sweet waitress but I'm kinda bummed about the food. Not sure what happened to this place.  I had tacos: fish, chicken and root vegetables. Chicken was good. The fish was greasy and plain. The root vegetables are potato and carrots: missing some important stuff- beets for a start. My husband had Mac n cheese what he sent back. Bummer for date night glad the company is good!"}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars. 3.5 for the food. I got the Cajun Salmon Salad and for the price I was disappointed. I was hoping for more of the \"free\" stuff- lettuce and peppers. The salmon was tasty but the vinagrette was more oil than citrus.   My boyfriend had the Chicken Chrozio melt which was very good from the few bites I stole. Next time I will have to go for a melt- his mom had the turkey avacado sandwich which looked good.  The 4 stars come in for the beer. I enjoyed the beer- better than some breweries out there. I had the Peanut Butter Coffee Porter- YUM! It was like iced coffee and I am a HUGE coffee drinker. I could have easily drank a few more of these... instead we got a growler to go with it! My second beer was the Railway Razz which was just tapped on Friday and I wasn't disappointed. I liked that I was able to taste the raspberry but still feel like I was drinking a beer.  I don't remember which beers the boy got but I know they were a hoppy goodness in my mouth."}
{"text":"Their beer menu was very short. They were trying to promote their own brews I guess. Had the porter which was decent, but nothing amazing. I had the meatloaf which was terrible. The Chorizo was so over powering I felt that my mouth was on fire with each bite. All the other food looked gross too, the sour cream on all the pizzas was super gross. The place was trying to be trendy and hip, but the food was very lack luster."}
{"text":"Out of a table of 6, I got my meal well after the others finished. Everyone at my table had a story of poor service here, and it is a shame because the food is good. This was my 3rd bad experience so I won't be back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was relaxing.  Food came out relatively quick for a Saturday.  They were gearing up to play live music but we came in a bit to early to hear them play.  Waitress was very nice and patient and got us everything we needed for a party of 9. Bar drinks were tasty and priced on the average for the location of the restaurant.  Apps were good, I got the pretzels but their dips were lackluster, I made a dip at home with my leftovers wick was better than their in house.  Burgers are always good and cooled just the way I like. A great restaurant for a simple meal or group outing"}
{"text":"Well, was having a great evening visiting my cousins and listening to Post Road all the way from North Carolina when a bouncer says I need to leave. WTF? Was just enjoying the evening and having some drinks and next thing I know, I'm told to leave. Will never come back. Didn't do anything and they refused to listen to me. What a shame to ruin my wonderful weekend. Band was awesome though."}
{"text":"Mediocre, overpriced food.  The $10 \"Devils on Horseback\" appetizer was a decent starter, but you can't go wrong with wrapping dates in bacon.  The $15 \"Crispy Shrimp Taco Trio\" was a huge disappointment.  Institutional grade, tasteless, fried shrimp tossed into flour tortillas from the supermarket and swimming in what they called lime crema.  The walleye in the \"Fish N' Chips\" was nicely battered and moist, but the chips consisted of a pile of the same waffles fries you get at Chik-fil-A (not an exaggeration).  I guess calling them \"Waffle Frites\" is supposed to make them upscale and justify charging $17 for a few pieces of fried fish and fast food waffle fries.    In fact, overall, it appears more effort was put into the menu layout and creative labeling of dishes than food quality and preparation.  You get the feeling that WBC desperately wants to be part of the food scene, but is unwilling to hire the necessary talent in the kitchen.  Oh, yeah, also got charged $5 to park in the restaurant's parking lot.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night.  There was a mediocre 80's band in the main bar area and techno DJ in the side bar.  The band itself was ok except that there are better 80's cover bands out there.  The bar was very full.  The side bar with techno was so loud that you couldn't talk to someone two feet from you.  The drinks were acceptable but not great.  Seems like a good place to pick up a rich guy, as there were mostly older men who were slightly dressed up."}
{"text":"We live in Cleveland and it's nice to visit different suburbs.  The Brew Co was very nice.  Staff was polite and the food was good.  Wide variety of beers.  Pleasant local crowd."}
{"text":"What better way to celebrate some good family news than over some great grub and beers?! We settled on one of our favorite laid-back spots... the Willoughby Brewing Co.  \"Nestled in the heart of Historic Downtown Willoughby, Ohio lies Willoughby Brewing Co. Established in February of 1998, we are a full-service restaurant, bar and award-winning brewery in a 100-year-old building that was originally a rail-car repair depot for the Cleveland to Ashtabula Interurban Rail Line.\" (http://www.willoughbybrewing.com/)  At first glance, the restaurant doesn't look too impressive with its vast, flat exterior.  But once you set foot inside you are welcomed with a wave of nostalgia. With it's warm wood finishings, train station decor (complete with a toy train set running around the resturant!), it's the kind of place that immediately welcomes you and makes you feel at home. I want to point out that the 'train station' decor is understated, classy and NOT cheesy but rather pretty authentic feeling.  I love the menu at the Willoughby Brewing Co. It isn't your typical bar fare. Ranging from fresh salads and sandwhiches to pizzas and grilled fish, there is something for everyone.  And for those beer connoisseurs out there, the Willoughby Brewing Co. does not disappoint! Many offerings are brewed on-site and the selection is pretty comprehensive. For those who can't make up their minds, the restaurant offers a sampler, which touts the six beers they have on tap that month.  The Mister and I started out with some of the BEST soft pretzels I've have the privilege to taste  -- my recommendation? Order at least TWO of these. The goodness did not go very far!  For dinner, I ordered the Turkey Cranberry Salad, which includes: Mixed greens Dried cranberries Walnuts GOAT CHEESE Roasted turkey Raspberry vinaigrette   I killed it.  The combination of goat cheese, walnuts and cranberries worked really well with the turkey. Love the combination of textures with the soft cheese and added crunch from the walnuts. It was light and refreshing -- just what I wanted.  Overall, a great place to spend an evening with family and friends!"}
{"text":"WOW... no good at all.  My wife ordered shrimp tacos and when they came out you could smell the \"fishy\" 100 yards away - my wife couldn't eat a bite.  The salads were bland and the services was really poor.  we will NOT being going back ever."}
{"text":"The bf and I went here for drinks and dinner last week and loved it! First off, the complimentary valet did come in handy as it was snowing and we didn't have the patience to look for a spot in their full lot in bad weather. We walked in and sat at the bar. The only thing that didn't warrant 5 stars was the service. It took a little bit to get a bartender over to us for our first round of drinks and for them to take our food order. We sampled some of their beers and chose the pale ale and the peanut butter coffee stout. Both were amazing. As for food, I had the build-your-own mac N cheese with bacon and spinach which was yum -O. The bf ordered a sammich with chorizo and something else. I forgot what else was in it but it tasted damn good. Their fries were nice and crispy and light too.  All in all, great experience despite the slow bar service. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The good is good and the patio seating is nice.  There are a lot of seating options inside, too.  However, no matter where you sit, it is just much too loud on the weekends.  It is almost unbearable.  The parking situation is also annoying, but they offer valet for those that trust their cars to teenagers."}
{"text":"This area of Willoughby is great. The atmosphere of both the neighborhood n restaurant are very trendy. The restaurant was crowded but not packed. I recommend reservations or getting there past 7. It seems that the restaurant has more tables than the staff  can handle. I'm not sure they'd be able to handle full capacity. They have their own beers, but our server wasn't very knowledgeable on the beers. She didn't even offer a sampling. She told us the specials, but didn't give details of the items. ie, my mom ordered the shrimp basket, only to find out after getting it ,that it was spicy. Overall the food was good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I suggest pairing the bbq pulled pork pizza with a pint of the peanut butter cup porter, but that's just me."}
{"text":"1st time reviewer long time Yelper. Had the pizza with bacon and spinach. Fantastic. Cosmic IPA is out of this world. Only thing better was the service. Emily was fantastic. 5/5. Would recommend to a friend.  Update: Emily is still awesome."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say that I am not a beer person, so I was leary to go here. But I was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere was great and the food menu was large. I started with a simple side salad and then split a pizza with my boyfriend. I was debating between that and the fried chicken (they had a rather extensive chicken menu). The tacos also looked good, so I will be making another trip back. The service was standard. I would have liked to have stayed for the band, but it didn't start until 10, and everyone we went with wanted to leave by 9. Just another reason to go back!"}
{"text":"Paid another visit on 12/9/17.  The Peanut Butter Cup Porter was fantastic, as was the Kolsch and the Creme Brulee.  Came for the beer, not the food.  Love the open space and the Bartender was great!   Restroom was clean, and loved that the music played in the 'background' so I could hear my husband talk (lol)."}
{"text":"Major downgrade. First of all, the food was still great, so that's where these stars are coming from. But the service was just awful, especially for 3pm on a Thursday when there were practically no customers at all. We sat outside and were pretty much forgotten about and had to do the ol' \"stretch and make a show of standing up and gathering our things\" before our server would come over to give us the bill. Plus, the beer is just terrible. Maybe I'm just a snob now. No, that's not it. The beer was just gross. The only one that is worth mentioning is the  PB Cup Coffee porter, but I am not a fan of that at all as it is.  But man, those pretzels really hit the spot..."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this place is fantastic!   We had a large group of people together and were hungry (mostly thirsty) after a wedding ceremony and before the reception. We had a long trek across town and needed to find somewhere closer to the reception hall and on the way. Lucky us, we ended up at Willoughby Brewing Company at the suggestion of a couple of friends.   The beers were definitely satisfactory; I'm often disappointed in brewery beers (MGB on W. 25th is a perfect example of the disappointment...) and find that they lack a certain specialty that should come with being served in a brewery. I wasn't disappointed here with the Rusty Rail.   We all ended up with appetizer platters that were more than just some frozen jalepeno poppers and quesadillas. I'm completely in love with soft pretzels and this one tops my love list. It was warm and soft and salty and perfect! Oh how I long for another...right now! The buffalo egg rolls were definitely interesting and I liked them more than the quesadillas. Quesadillas aren't often my favorites anyways, so it wasn't a shock.   I know I'll be back for some beer and a soft pretzel...or two."}
{"text":"This was our first stop on our way to Cleveland. It is slightly buried behind other buildings. Very glad we made this stop! The street it's located on is very cute, with a bunch of little mom and pop stores, food places and behind it all is giant Willoughby brewing.  -The beer we sampled a bunch. Their \"best\" beer was listed as the Peanut Butter Coffee Stout..it wasn't horrible, but tasted mostly coffee.  The Moonshadow IPA was very nice, really hoppy.  The porter was okay.  The Pale Ale was delicious.  -As for food we got the app platter which was a pretzel, buffalo egg rolls, chicken quesadilla and it came with a great beer cheese and jelly...it was all delicious and worth getting for two. The mac and cheese was A LOT of food, but also very tasty.  -The bartender whose name escapes me was an awesome guy, very knowledgeable and extremely nice.  I also noticed many of the staff were special needs adults and thought it was really cool that the owners give out jobs to any qualified person and don't discriminate, so bonus points there!  -All in all, this place was awesome. The size is just massive inside, two separate bars both equally huge, one inside and one outside, very clean, and just an all around great place to sit back and drink."}
{"text":"Ate here three times, If your a foodie... It's ok. There are better places to go in Willoughby Hills. It's a tourist trap... That's all it is..."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Rustic, nicely decorated, comfortable.  Drinks: Loved them.  They are known for their craft beers which are supposed to be phenomenal, but I don't care for beer so I got one of their white peach sangrias.  Delicious.  Food: we started off with the nachos with the pork and the pitas and beer cheese and banana peppers.  It sounds like such an odd combo but I promise you it was amazing.  Try it!   Service: Our server was spectacular.  He was on top of everything, very friendly, and very attentive.   Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars is spot on for this place but I decided to kick in an extra. 5 stars for the band the resultant crowd it generated on the dance floor.  What great people watching!  The Hefeweizen and Peanut Butter Porter beers are delicious.  Eggrolls are tasty.  The chili...hmm, not so good.  Bland and needed salt.  Potato Cheddar soup was mediocre.  Very cool interior with exposed brick.  Definitely a great place to hang out at the bar and toss back a few cold ones but the food?  Eh, not so much."}
{"text":"Great space inside, tons of parking, tons of quality beer options, live music, tasty food, I could go on and on, but Willoughby Brewing Company just gets it.  We stopped by after a late movie on a Friday night, were immediately seated in a spacious booth and greeted by a friendly knowledgeable server. I went with her beer recommendation of a heart daze and was not disappointed. My wife swears their peanut butter beer is one of the best around.  We started out with the spinach con queso which was a very large portion with a ton of chips and lots of flavor. I used the jalapeno in it as its own chip because I like it spicy and it was the smart move. We were still hungry so we split 6 hot buffalo wings and a black bean burger. The fries with the black bean burger were top notch, cooked well and lots of flavor. The hot buffalo sauce on the wings really took them to the next level, and they were whole wings which are my favorite. My wife enjoyed the black bean burger more than me but she said it tasted great and was composed well (not falling apart like other places)  We heard a live band setting up so we paid our bill, went to the larger bar and dance room section for a night cap and some fun. Great people and a great time all around."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for conversation and always a great selection of on-site brewed beers on tap, including many seasonal selections.  Great appetizers, and also a fairly good selection of liquor drinks / shots.  Good bands on the weekends.  They could probably use more seating and a bit more variety in the dinner menu, but overall this is my favorite local night-spot."}
{"text":"I will start off saying i rarely leave reviews except if the place is really good an deserving or really bad. Unfortunately i would have to say this place was very disappointing. I almost didn't come here because it only had 3.5 stars but the lady at front desk of hotel said it was good so we gave it a try. When we first arrived we were seated and we ordered several of the small glasses of beer. I will give this place credit and say all the beers were really good but that's where it stopped. We ordered food from our waitress and never saw her again except when she was walking around the restaurant with a friend drinking a beer. So we assumed she got off work and just let her table go. We had to flag someone down to get us extra condiments for our burger and salad. The food was below mediocre. The burger tasted like a four ounce frozen burger you would buy in bulk. The guy that brought us our condiments was rude and seemed very annoyed we bothered him, however it turns out he was our replacement waiter but we never knew until i had to flag him down again to get our check. I rarely tip under 20% however this was a time when it was needed. Usually when a waitress is leaving she lets you know who the new person who would be serving and usually the new server would at least ask if everything was ok, which never happened. And to find out he was our new server and didn't want to be bothered was the reason for the 12% tip. I wish i could have given this place more stars because the beer was good however service and food were terrible."}
{"text":"Two stars because I'm in a good mood.....  Went here for a rehearsal dinner weeks back. First off, the required valet parking is annoying. Maybe nice for some but not for me.  The room we were in was okay at first. The chairs were CHEAP and I felt like I might break them at any given moment should I move the wrong way. The roof leaked (it was raining) less than 30 minutes into being there. Their answer? No sorry....just moved te table it was affecting clockwise as to avoid the drips and went along with the evening as if it wasn't an issue...  Ok, the options for food were steak or chicken or fish. The steak I tasted from my dates plate was bland and not seared. Whatever. he chicken I ordered with some kind of weird rice/walnut crusty coating was GROSS! Dry, bland, and WEIRD!!No one liked the food and, no, I wasn't being a food snob or dick about it.   The bottom line to me was....someone was paying good money for this gathering and WBC could care less.   I wouldn't even give them another chance based on this."}
{"text":"Service was great, but the food wasn't anything to brag about. It sounded amazing on the menu, but was very disappointed with the taste. The pork on my sandwich was very dry and both meals purchased were both bland and didn't have much flavor. Overall was not happy with the price paid for such blah food."}
{"text":"Great spot in down town Willoughby. Love their beer they brew in house & have great food. Service was fast too!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good. Had the appetizer platter which was yummy but the Spinach con queso has no flavor- but the chips and pita chips were delicious.  French onion soup was packed with cheese and had a good flavor.  Steak was good and potatoes had a nice flavor. I got the lobster mac and cheese. I am not sure the mac and cheese had any cheese in it. It was not tasty at all."}
{"text":"Willoughby Brewing Company is a gem nestled in Downtown Willoughby!  I have been there both with my family and for work events, and I am never disappointed. The food is delicious, the craft beers are wonderful, and the staff is always friendly! I would highly recommend grabbing a brew there!"}
{"text":"Went for a business meeting on a Wednesday night and there was plenty of seating, in fact it was really empty. Our server was prompt and professional and overall good. We had the pretzel for appetizer and it was very good, I would order this again. I had the pineapple salmon with asian slaw and garlic green beans. The salmon was over cooked and was just OK. If you have cooked salmon at home- yours is probably better. The asian slaw had no taste if asian flavor and was somewhat bland. The green beans advertised as garlic green beans were also very bland. Overall 3 stars. I think this place is good for drinking and some mediocre bar food and that's it. I wouldn't make a special trip to come back."}
{"text":"Had a special order that they messed up, no cheese, re-plated with correct meat but cold sides.  BTW the same sides were sent back in corrected order.  Not worth the money on a simple order."}
{"text":"Love this place.  My fiancee and I like to go for the happy hour beer and appetizer specials, which are sufficient for a meal!  I haven't had a beer I don't like there, and the quesadilla, pizza, and pretzel apps are great.  The service in the bar area leaves a bit to be desired, but overall a good enough experience to merit multiple repeat trips."}
{"text":"Ok place but nothing to go out of your way for.  Place is dirty and unclean. 20 years ago it was a nice place and today you can tell that they have not moved with the times.  Our server was awful and apparent that she had never been properly trained. Took forever to be greeted and then she huffed when we told her we were ready to order during her first visit to the table. Told her we were in a hurry and she passed by our table where our visa was waiting 4 times.  I had a wrap which had jalapeños that were from a jar or can. If you can't use fresh foods why even bother??  We got up and got our own to go box. Table was sticky and all the wood work needed dusting through out the entire place."}
{"text":"Great buffalo chicken pizza and Railway Razz!!  The Hubby loves Hopnotic!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were on a road trip from Cape Cod to Minnesota and my wife had found Willoughby Brewing online and really wanted to try their Chocolate Peanut Butter Porter.  We drove about 45 minutes out of our way on our 24 hour road trip to get here.  We got to the address and couldn't find the building.  After walking around a bit we finally found it tucked back in an alley and ran down to it since it was only 15 minutes until their website said they closed.    When we got there it turns out they'd closed early because business was quite slow that Sunday night.  This is where Willoughby really started to shine!  2 servers were sitting talking on the patio and we mentioned to them that we were in the middle of a 24 hour road trip and had gone out of our way to try the porter so the servers got up, let us in and poured us samples.  It was delicious!  I'm not generally big on adjuncts in my beer but this was very well balanced with a delicious chocolate and peanut butter taste that balanced nicely with the porter.  I highly recommend it.    While we were tasting the manager and former brewmaster walked back in and when we told them the story, and mentioned we were homebrewers, we ended up having a long pleasant talk with both of them and got a tour of the place including their hop vines.    They could not have been more gracious and accommodating, especially given that they had closed well before we showed up.  I can't say enough good things about the service at Willoughby Brewing and love the CPB Porter. I'm going to try to brew a version of it at home now."}
{"text":"Have been going to here for years and years. Anytime im out with people in Downtown Willoughby we always stop by. Its one of the biggest and busiest bars in willoughby. Their locally brewed beer is delicious. Crazy how decent the service is when its 2 people deep all around the bar. The down fall of the place is how busy it is late nights, but who goes to a place like this late on a Saturday and complains its to busy. Dj if you like to dance on the weekends."}
{"text":"This is probably one of best Brewing company restaurants I have ever eaten at since living in Ohio.  We were skeptical of the ambiance of the restaurant since we were with my daughter who is only 6 years old.  We were concerned about the ambiance since it was after 8:00PM.  The restaurant was definitely equipped to entertain people of all ages.  The valet politely parked our car.  We were seated right away in a cozy booth in the restaurant area.  Our server Jim was absolutely the most attentive server we have ever had when dining at a brewery.  We ordered serval dishes from the Chicken Salad, to the Chicken Strips, naked chicken wings, and Asparagus on the side.  It was amazing to say the least for being a brewery.  The beer selection was excellent as well.    Overall, I would definitely recommend this Brewery when traveling through Willoughby suburbs of Cleveland.  Great ambiance, food, and service all around.  This is a family like atmosphere with no skepticism from this family.  Everyone was happy and enjoyed their foods."}
{"text":"Let me be honest, the 4th star in this rating is all due to Peanut Butter Cup Coffee Porter. Without a doubt one of the best local beers around. So tasty and complex, but also subtle and drinkable. The other beers are pretty good, too, along with the food. Definitely above average brewpub fare. I also like the layout and the new patio. Pain in the ass for me to get here, so that is a downer. Oh, I should mention it can be tough to find the first time. You have to drive down an alley off the main rd into a large parking area so keep the peepers open for a sign."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer and good (though not amazing) food - overall, a fun place to go!  This is a bit of a trek for me since I live on the west side of Cleveland but I'm glad I checked it out. The beers here are so good! I love the Peanut Butter Cup Coffee porter but also tried another porter and their Ocktoberfest - both excellent! Everyone was very happy with the beers they tried.   Food was good but could have been better. I got the fried green tomato sandwich. I thought it would be a little more exciting. Fries are just whatever. Everyone in my group was pleased but not blown away by the food. They could step it up a notch but it's fine. Basically, don't go here just for the food. Either go here for drinks before/after another meal or go ahead and eat but don't expec the food to be as awesome as the beer.   Friendly staff, awesome looking brewery on the inside, everything else was great! Would have given it 5 stars if the food was more exciting."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience!  First we pull in and park and then some guy approaches us telling us there's a $5 valet fee...even though we parked our own car.  We pay it and head in.  All day I'd been trying to make reservations on Open Table but WBC's system was off line all day it kept telling me.  I'm told it's a 45 minute wait.  We go over to the bar area but there are no available seats so we head back outside. My husband then calls and makes a reservation...4 minutes from that time.  We walk back into the restaurant and get a table.  We wait 15 minutes before we're acknowledged by our server.  We order drinks, our appetizer and our meals since we'd been waiting for so long.  In lightening fast speed our entrees show up before we even get our drinks, appetizer or silverware.  The guy that delivered the food, Jim, sprang into action and got us water and silverware.  He seemed to realize how annoyed i was at our experience so far.  He's a big part of the reason this isn't a 1-star review.  My mac & cheese was good. My husband wasn't in love with the poutine he got.  The pretzel was good but I hated the magma and mustard dips.  The porter caramel sauce was delicious.  Another saving grace was the ridiculously cheap turtle cheesecake at $3.50/slice.  Yum!  We definitely won't return.  Service was terribly lacking and the whole reservation/45 minute seating time just pissed me off.  Update:  While I appreciate someone reaching out to me, there is nothing possible to get me to return.  I felt the response was a bit condescending in regards to my attempts to book a reservation on Open Table.  I wanted the points and it took very little effort to try to make a reservation on Open Table.  Also, if I were WBC I would have contacted OT and had my listing removed so patrons wouldn't experience what I did which reflecting poorly on WBC.  This wasn't my only visit to WBC.  I've been there probably a half dozen times so it isn't a one-n-done review.  I've never held a high opinion of the place."}
{"text":"Love coming to wbc. Great place to come for a great lunch or dinner. They always have different live music acts on the weekends. The best part is their craft beer. A peanut butter porter is a must try."}
{"text":"Typically love WBC...excellent beers/awesome happy hour apps... Was there for happy hour Sunday, round 5:30... Ordered couple beers(hazy days served from can instead of draft) ordered apps(spring rolls, pizza, pretzels, and quesadilla)  everything was ok on time, except the quesadilla which they said they accidentally made w chicken instead of cheese. It later came, and after eating a piece or two, reached for another to realize there was a DEAD FLY baked into the top of the cheese... Immediately told one of the bar tenders who was in disbelief, and said it was just a piece of something burnt from oven, had to concur with other bar tender, then they took it away, took it off the bill, and took our 2 beers off the bill.  It was a fly, it was plain as daylight, don't know how it occured, shit happens I know, but in all likelihood will never eat here again. The bar back also creeped my girlfriend out by knowing her work place, and the exact date she was in last w her father(9months prior)... This was on the way to the bathroom.. Love the beers, gonna be loooooong time before I would ever eat here again, or prob even visit... Really disappointing"}
{"text":"This is a place that was opened many years ago by a guy who graduated a few years ahead of me in high school. He no longer owns the place but we still enjoy visiting. It was one of the first brewery's I had ever been to. I still enjoy stopping in when I am in town. On weekends they always have bands and it is one of the better places to hit when in downtown Willoughby. I usually run into old friends because let's face it if you are from Lake County no one leaves! Lol parking can be a challenge on the weekends so using heir valet is worthwhile. I am sure when we are in town next month for a wedding we will eventually find our way into the brewing company. I hope they have a few new beers on the menu that I can try."}
{"text":"Great beer, staff was good.  First time there so a little more information from the bar tender would of been good.  Since it was my first time I mentioned to the bartender that I will start with the $2 5-oz samples, because I like to get the sample flights were I go.  After two of them, it was mentioned to me that it was Happy Hour and for $1 more I could get a pint.  So if that was mentioned first thing, I know that those two 5-oz beers would of been a 16-oz for a $1.  Had all but one beer that was on tap this time, they do switch out with different beers.  The IPA was a good IPA.  If you like fruit beer, try the Railway Razz, it had a nice strong raspberry taste to it.  Hopnotic will get you in trouble as it is 9% ABV.  I am mostly an IPA guy, but there Hazy Days American Pale Wheat Ale was one of my favorites at this place.  Had a pizza to eat, good food, not anything to write home about.  But it was 1/2-off during Happy Hour....so in turn....it made me Happy, LOL."}
{"text":"I work at a \"beer bar\" in Chicago, so it's expected that I'd go here.  The brewpub calls an old rail-car repair depot home.  I am a sucker for the \"Warehouse Loft\" feel.  The building has a cozy feel despite ts large, open floorplan and super-high ceilings.  The brewing equipment is well-kept and polished behind a glass partition that doubles as the back-bar.  A model train track is hung suspended from the rafters and huge skylights let in a good amount of natural light that is needed in the rather dark building.  Here's what I had.  My first beer was the d.I.P.A they tapped just the day before .  It poured as you would expect a double IPA to pour, a nice dark brown with a full thick, syrupy body.  It was hopped nicely and although it lacked the malt character I like in a well-balanced dIPA (see Surly 16 Grit), it was still a very well done dIPA.  While sipping on my snifter of \"Doubting Thomas\", we ordered a sampler of the three dips they offered as an appetizer.  The best dip by far being the buffalo chicken dip.  The bruschetta dip was very enjoyable as well.  The spinach con queso dip was tasty, not bad at all, but compared to the winner and runner-up, this second-loser had no chance.  After my rear-tongue was ready for another beer (yeah, probably should save the d.I.P.A for the end of the meal), I ordered the nut-brown (\"Northern Trail\").  Very easy to drink, lots of coffee and roasted malt, and wasn't as heavy as I expected, nothing crazy exciting here, a solid brown.  I enjoyed their Lost Nation Pale Ale with my meal (Pretzel Chix).  The beer was an OK Pale Ale, no unique characteristics, well-hopped nonetheless.  The chicken was a tad overcooked, but I enjoy slightly pink chicken breast, so it's subjective.  I ordered it with risotto instead of mashed potatoes,a solid risotto it was.  I wanted to finish my meal with the Bourbon Vanilla POW Porter, however they were out...I was a little upset as I was really looking forward to trying it.  If the food and beer was great, what kept the place from earning five stars?  A few things.  Parking.  Parking is near impossible to find.  They do offer $3 valet if you get frustrated.  The prior week my parents raved about the live music, however a band called \"More than Me\" performed this visit.  It's too bad the volume was so loud and unbalanced, I couldn't hear their voices.  I don't know who to blame, the brewery or the band, as I don't know whose payroll the soundboard operator was on.  The band wasn't bad from what we heard though.  How was service you may ask?  It was good, not great, but good.  It has nothing to do with our actual server though.  She was very attentive and handled my outspoken father with grace (she was also very attractive in the sense that she carried herself professionally and obviously had respect for herself and her image, which I couldn't say about most of her we'll say \"rather lascivious-looking\" co-workers)  So, if this single twentysomething [me] had a beautiful server who was attentive and professional, why the knock on service?  Basically, there are steps that a restaurant should take in training their staff.  We took a seat in the \"seat yourself\" area by the bar in front of the stage before the table was cleaned, no biggie, happens all the time, this isn't where my complaints start.  An older lady greeted us promptly when we sat, as our actual server was busy, that's good teamwork.  The problem was, as she wiped the table off, I noted that she could probably refill the hollowicks [candles] in the middle of the table to which she responded \"oh no, we won't be doing that now, not while we're so busy, we'll get to them before dark\".  It was dusk, and was already a strain to read the menus.  They weren't busy by any means.  Perhaps it really isn't a big deal, but one of my biggest pet peeves when managing my servers is when they let their candles burn out, in fact, I instruct the host(ess) to not seat a table if its candle is burnt out.  I digress.  Another faux-pas on behalf of management at this brewpub was twofold.  The bar was poorly stocked.  Not everyone who goes to this place will drink beer, management should realize this.  Stock your bar!  My mother doesn't drink beer, she loves her margaritas though and after getting sick the week before off a cogener-stocked well tequilla mixed margarita, I told her to get something a little better, they had Cuervo and Patron.  When I asked for bourbon, their top-shelf brand was Jim Beam...nuff said.  They should take the initiative to expand their liquor selection, even the beer lover like myself desires his woodford reserve when it comes to post-meal drink time.  Fold two?  They never taught the servers what liquors they had, thus forcing our server to retreat to take an instant inventory whenever I asked for a specific brand of adult-beverage.  P.S.  I'm taking the liberty of revoking Murray's man-card, raspberry beer sir?  Stick to your appletinis."}
{"text":"I was super pumped to be on the East side & so close to the Willoughby Brewing Co.  The man & I popped in here for a quick beer before we visited the Holden Arboretum.  We did a flight of all the beers on tap to help us make our final beer selection.  These are big pours for $1 each!   I tried the Peanut Butter Cup beer on a recommendation from a friend; that friend & I obviously have VERY different tastes.  I wasn't really impressed with anything on tap & ended up with a beer, that I didn't need to finish.  We ordered the pretzel appetizer and while the pretzels were nice, warm, & soft, the side dips were crap.  I know, I'm a pretzel snob, and nothing really compares to the pretzels and beer cheese side at the Haufbrauhaus.  Even the amazing Guinness mustard at The Angle bar in Cleveland topped this stuff.  Overall, Willoughby Brewing, you're a disappointment.  I don't need to visit again."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed by my visit Wednesday. It seemed promising with $3 craft beers and a live band warming up. Our ski club was holding its March Dinner of the month. Service was spotty.  I had to get a beer from the bar.  The beer was fine. Our group got food at different times. I ordered the shrimp bahn mi. The sandwich was tasty and the shrimp were tender but I think it could have used more vegetables.  There was some shell left in the fried shrimp. My waitress thought that my order came with a side but it did not. She charged me a $2 up charge for the side salad I ordered. Then to top the night off, both the men's and women's restrooms were closed because of plumbing problems. I would have stayed longer but not under those conditions."}
{"text":"The main attraction here is the brewery on premises. The day I visited there were 8 house beers on tap along with 2 guest brews. Of course in a brewpub, I always order a flight of beers and Willoughby Brewery does not place a limit on how many you can order at one time so I had a sample of all ten, it's OK, I was not driving. The bartender, Kenny, was very friendly and most knowledgeable about the craft beer industry as we chatted extensively. I became hungry, as I always do when drinking beer and ordered the Bavarian Pretzels appetizer & later, a Margherita Pizza. The dipping sauces for the pretzels were very spicy, just the way I like it and the pizza was thin crust, fresh and hot. Took home a couple of crowlers, 32 oz sealed cans of beer poured from the tap, stays fresh about a week. The tab for the day was less than $50 which is very reasonable considering how much beer I consumed as well as the take out. Overall, a great time and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Today's experience is worth 2.5 stars. My friend and I walked into the restaurant on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch.  With the exception of a private party on the patio, the place was not particularly busy.   The food was good, but the service was underwhelming.  Coffee was not refilled, and the beer menu was out of date, with several selections unavailable (hence giving up and drinking coffee). Our waiter seemed more interested in watching golf than helping his customers.  Additionally, the bathrooms were not up to snuff in the cleanliness department.    I'd probably try Willoughby Brewing Co again, but this time wasn't so great."}
{"text":"We love the pretzel and the chicken dish the pork belly on it makes it all hat much better"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere during weekends, especially in the summer. They have bands as well as a Dj. Great to meet up friends or do a ladies night out."}
{"text":"The pretzel appetizer was absolutely delicious!  I had peanut butter coffee porter and I sampled the creme brûlée beers. Hands down they were some of the best beers I've had!  I ate the hotwings which were alright."}
{"text":"This is another place I'd love to love.  I mean honestly... local brewery, cool town, neat logo...  I digress.  The parking lot smells like something is rotting.  The interior does not smell much better.  I am one of those weirdos with a super sensitive sniffer, but yikes...I couldn't even consider eating there.  I frequent Willoughby spots a lot, so I will try it again, and promise to update if I find something improved/different.    The beer.  Well, I can tell you as a frequent beer fest attendee - their tent usually is easy to get to because no one is clammoring to have their stuff.  I was so pumped to try the famous peanut butter cup beer... which I promptly dumped. Everything I've had that has been ok has been... forgettable.  Sigh.  I really want to like this place."}
{"text":"I've been here for food and for drinks.  I think overall a 3.5 stars, but bump it up to 4 for atmosphere etc.  I went with a group from work for lunch one day and they were able to help a group of 7 of us and split our checks, which was so appreciated.  The hamburger I got was ok, I couldn't taste the sauce on it though.  The waffle fries- amazing!!  I just wish it would have been brought a tad quicker since they really weren't that busy when we were in there.  If you come on a Thurs/Fri/Sat night, good atmosphere, busy and tons of alcohol choices.  If you like your beer, this is a place to come and hang out for awhile"}
{"text":"My friend and I were driving back to Boston from Chicago. After a few long hours on the road, we stopped here for a late dinner.  The place was fun. Everything from the model train chugging around tracks suspended from the ceiling to the 70's soul band playing to a very enthusiastic (and inebriated) crowd made this one hell of a stop.   Our steaks were great for the price. And for 7 bucks, I got a sampler of the house beers. As a warning, their \"samplers\" are filled to the top, and one tray does not count as a beer. (Needless to say, I didn't drive the rest of that night).  If you're in the area, and don't want to stop in the city, this is a nice relaxing place to stop (based on my one time here). I'd say I'd go back... but its not worth the 7 hour drive. Though, I may just have been overly amused by the band and the trains..."}
{"text":"Twice I've had terrible service here. I ordered the risotto for dinner and it came out undercooked. I told my server and he said sorry but did not offer to get me something different and we paid for it anyway although I only took one bite. Thus salmon that came with was ok, but overall the meals I've had here are not good. The beer is ok, but they have much better food options in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to have dinner here.he got fish and chips(amazing) I got southwest chicken wrap(the best wrap in a long time) Kyle our server very nice and food was nice and hot sooo good!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave one star is because the hostess turned the music off for my father in law.  I guess if we went to just drink it would have been fine but for lunch they were horrible.  Burnt food, over salty, and a server who knew nothing about the menu.  We were expecting sports bar food - nope just expensive weird food.  Sorry won't go back."}
{"text":"For the most part, a fun, happening place...  THE UP-SIDE:  Good food in a big, open atmosphere.  Not your typical Applebee's type place, but not high-end either; somewhere in the middle.  THE DOWN-SIDE:  On certain nights they have bands, and that blows the atmosphere right out the window.  It's way too loud.  If you're looking for a nice dinner, go when there isn't a band playing.  THE SUM-IT-UP:  Definitely worth a visit if you go on the right night."}
{"text":"You can almost taste the Sysco brand blandness to the food here.  Not terrible, just...bland.  The service is okay, but nothing wonderful or terrible.  The whole place is just.......  so-so. No hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Good food but pricy. It was nice trying a \"flight\" of beers also. We go on special occasions"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times with my family and friends the service is always top quality and the good is great and the beer is created on site and the bar tenders are very easy to talk to and take the time to explain each  beer and what would be a good food pairing with it the brew co is a must go"}
{"text":"Do not order the French Onion Soup! Should be called Oregano and Bread Soup. Seriously the most awful tasting soup I've ever eaten.  They were out of steak so I had to settle for grilled chicken on my Southwest Salad. Everything came out of a can and the cucumbers were sliced in gigantic pieces that looked like squash. Not an English cucumber but a regular cucumber with the tough peel. Table was sticky and the ladies bathroom filthy and grimy. Whole place needs a deep cleaning. Service was good. I'll give them that for a star. We would come here often when passing through from PA to Cleveland. Next time we'll find a new place - many to choose from in the area."}
{"text":"You still get 3 stars, WBC.   Your cover bands are still hilarious (a dude singing Lady Gaga? Really?) Your clientele is just as douchey as ever (moms jeans and chachy guys everywhere). Your patio is still a refuge from what takes place inside.   I like your beer!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable lunch with a very attentive server to all five of us.  I ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos with a side of Broccoli.  The tacos were delicious and the broccoli was cooked perfectly....not overcooked.  Would definitely return the next time we are in Downtown Willoughby."}
{"text":"Born of a rail line repair depot, this spot is a must-try for the common eastsider. It's in downtown Willoughby and has ample parking out front. Try to pick a night that either doesn't have a band (too, too loud) or allows for imbibing on the outdoor patio (very, very refreshing).   Try a flight of beers before you pick your poison. The brews don't taste very robust, but they're flavorful nonetheless. My favorite -- and I'm one of many here -- is the Railway Razz, a raspberry ale that's more fruity than it is beery. It's won several awards -- rightfully so.   The food is good but I tend to think it's subpar when directly compared with the prices. Almost every dish I've ordered is overly salty. Sometimes, salt is good, but definitely not every time. Especially not on a $20 New York Strip Steak.  Worth ordering every time:  - Railway Razz (yes, I'll push it at every opportunity) - Bibb Salad (mmmmmm, so buttery and nutty and fruity) - Mashed Potato Pizza (I haven't seen it elsewhere, and it's foodgasm-inducing, considering it's made of garlic mashed potatoes, bacon, green onions, and cheese, with sour cream to dip each slice in. MMMM!)"}
{"text":"Loved the peanut butter cup coffee porter! Highly recommend trying it. Went in for St Paddys day and they had the best live band who sang such a range of music from newer songs to spice works. Great mix of people and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We went there for Christmas in July event. They must have given all their servers Christmas in July off. We sat there and were totally ignored. After 15 minutes we left.  We will never return."}
{"text":"I had not been to WBC in a couple of years, no particular reason, the food has always been pretty tasty.  My daughters and I stopped her on a Saturday afternoon, for appetizers and WBC didn't disappoint!   We were seated immediately, and proceeded to order the appetizer sampler and the buffalo chicken dip.  The food arrived very quickly, in less than 10 minutes (yay!)  The chicken dip was piping hot and accompanied by warm fried pita rounds, which were tasty, while hot.  As the chips cool down, they turn hard, but still good.  The dip had a nice flavor and texture.  The serving was very generous.  The appetizer platter included quesadillas, (we opted for chicken, but also were offered short rib), chicken spring rolls and bavarian pretzels, accompanied by various dipping sauces, including a grainy mustard (yummy!).  Once again the portion was very generous and the food was fresh and tasty.  There was nothing about this visit that we didn't enjoy.   Our server Kelley, was very attentive and personable.  I will definitely visit again.....soon!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were in Cleveland and I really wanted to stop here for a peanut butter cup coffee porter!  The beer was excellent, picked up a growler for $16.   We found the restaurant without any problem. Downtown Willoughby is really cute and this restaurant is tucked behind all the Main Street type shops/bars/restaurants.  It is way bigger than I ever expected but their parking lot leaves something to be desired.  It is small, especially with half of it blocked off for valet.  Valet is free (other than the tip at the end) but since I had no cash, this wasn't an option.  We finally stalked a family walking to their minivan and took their spot.  When we walked in the restaurant was even larger than I thought.  The hostess said it would be a 45 min wait or we could sit in one of the two bars.  We chose the bar.  We found a high top table and waited..and waited...and waited.  We finally saw a blonde streak fly by and help the table next to us but before we knew it she was gone again.  She returned 5 mins later and as she was passing by she asked for our drink order.  She came back about 10 mins later but didn't stop to ask what we'd like to eat.  I finally flagged her down to order pork nachos and two buffalo melts.  The pork nachos were delivered about 15 mins later and overall were excellent.  The pork was moist and flavorful.  The BBQ sauce was out of this world.  Unfortunately, 1/2 the chips were really, really stale so we ended up eating the topping and leaving the chips.  Our buffalo melts were delivered about 10 mins later.  They were presented nicely and the chicken was really moist.  Both of us scraped the mashed potatoes off our sandwiches, that was just a little to weird.  Otherwise, they were really tasty.   This experience would have been a lot more enjoyable with a better server.  She never told us about the appetizer specials or drink specials and was just in too much of a hurry the whole time.  If I'm ever back in Cleveland I would return for their beer but not much more."}
{"text":"The sangria is worth your time, in our opinion. We also enjoyed the onion rings, cheeseburgers, and spinach dip. The beers are rock-solid, and you have to love the classic Cleveland beer logos on the walls. The model train? A cute touch."}
{"text":"Had an awesome lunch!  Excellent food and amazing beer selection all just a short ride off the highway.  Maybe one of the best chicken wraps I ever had!!  Get some!!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch so my experiences might not be the same as the core dinner/drinks crowd.  This place would be a great business lunch location if they had WiFi. The tables are huge and it's not busy at all. In fact, we were the only people there from 11-noon and then one other table was there from noon-1.  The portions of food are enormous. I probably would have just ordered the appetizers if I had known just how big the burger was going to be.  As others have mentioned, the location is a little tricky to find. There is an alley by Olivor Twist. Just drive into the alley and you'll see it. There's a huge parking lot back there. They really should try to get a sign out there on Erie Street since this appears to be a common issue.  Overall, a good showing. I won't be rushing back but I would go again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"To start off, slow waitress / staff and confusion who was taking care of our table.  Second, mashed potatoes were watery, Broccoli was hard, green beans mushy, pasta mushy.  When staff was informed of problem w potatoes they were unable to accommodate w a replacement (baked potato) but kept pushing more mashed potatoes even though they were told we didn't want more of the same. Then the waitress asks how's the doctored up mashed potatoes....really. Lol. You would expect real potatoes at this restaurant.  No free refills on soft drinks (taste like dish water an again the waitress said yah it tastes like it's out of a garden hose) or ice tea ($2.49 x5). The only good part of our meals was the meat, beer an ice tea!"}
{"text":"So sad this place used to be so good.  My husband and I made the trek across town for this establishment's peanut butter coffee porter. I wish I could say it was worth the trip. We ordered our first round of beers.and it was a little disappointing. Kolsch was pretty standard fare. Their raspberry beer lacks the flavor it formerly had which was a sad surprise.   The food was nothing special. Their pulled pork is from an external source and was served to my husband cold. When we notified our server her response was they mix it up after they nuke it. . . yes microwaving at it's best people. The fries were way to salty. They also were not fresh they were GFS fake tato fries. The sandwich I ordered was nothing special either. Multigrain bread toasted sometime earlier in the millenia, fake smoke flavored turkey, smoked cheddar american cheese and what they called applewood bacon that was in all honesty too burnt to tell what it was other than formerly food. The coleslaw was beyond bland and looked more like vommit than food.   The staff acts too cool to bother with customer service which is disappointing at a local brew pub where if anything you should feel welcomed. We gave up on a second round after sitting 15 minutes with empty glasses and not even a glance from the server.   Such a shame this place used to be so much better. Not worth the drive to Willoughby Go to fathead's instead the food, sevice, atmosphere, beer, and price are all better."}
{"text":"We met another couple for a late lunch at Willoughby Brewing Company last Sunday, and overall it was a good experience. I don't spend much time in the neighborhood and has no idea downtown Willoughby was a \"thing,\" but this brewery is a solid spot.  The main building was hosting a fundraiser so we ate in the covered patio outside; it was a pleasant area except for the obscenely loud TV, which they did adjust on request so we could hear each other. They have some tasty beers: I don't know that I'd want a whole pint of it but the peanut butter cup porter I tasted was interesting, and kölch was quite good. As far as food goes, the shrimp tacos were decent, if a little soggy. The pulled pork sandwich was described as \"all right.\" The pretzel appetizer was on point though, with delicious beer cheese sauce on the side as well as a tasty whole grain mustard and oddly, a caramel sauce. Fries are everywhere, but the ones here were crispy how I like them with more flavor than most.  Service was a little weird-- we had a few people stop by instead of just one server-- but no real problems. Prices were reasonable. They share a parking lot with several other restaurants in the area and it was pretty crowded, but it's nice to have it there.  I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to make a repeat visit, but I wouldn't say no to another try if I found myself in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy going to the Willoughby Brewing Company. I rather enjoyed their craft  microbrew beers. However lately the actual physical building has fallen into such disrepair it's starting to look as if the owners no longer care about this building. For example there was a urinal in the men's room that was covered up with a garbage bag that's been covered up with a garbage bag for a week or two it doesn't take that long to fix a urinal. There are broken tiles on the floor the entire place simply reeks like a place that has him and mopped in ages. Every horizontal service seemed to be sticky and unclean. I'm not sure that I would eat here anymore.  This place used to be the place to go when you wanted to see a fun live band and have some drinks in a cool bar. But I can't help but notice the disrepair. In my humble opinion this place needs to close down for a month or two and remodel as not only is it becoming tired it just smells. Given the recent competition in downtown Willoughby such as the Morehouse and the closing of burgers 2 beer I suggest the owners of Willoughby Brewing Company tread lightly and do the very best they can to retain the few customers they have left. When there's this much competition people will choose to go someplace that's a little better kept. I gave it 2 stars because the Eighties band they had playing that night was really good and the beer I had was cold and served in a clean glass I guess."}
{"text":"I've got something to get off of my chest before I get into the whole dining/beer experience thing:  WTF is up with places and the \"complimentary\" valet parking? I've bitched about this before with Burntwood Tavern and I'm gonna bitch about it again with this place. They've got a private lot. It's right next to the restaurant. Why the hell would anyone need to have their car valet parked? And let's call it what it is, a scam. It's not complimentary if you've got any sense of decency because you'll end up tipping the guy $2 or $3. Get rid of it. It's annoying, pretentious and unnecessary. Now, on with the show.  We don't exactly live close to Willoughby so I doubt we'll ever be regulars, but I've gotta admit, they're a pretty solid joint. I can't speak for the bar scene or the live music (although the guy that was playing when we were there was pretty close to bad) or the patio but when it comes to pretty damn good pub food and a strong portfolio of well-made craft beer WBC is a bit of alright.  The space is airy, open and big with uber-high ceilings and big comfy booths. There's a cute little train that runs along a track up by the rafters and the natural light is all over the place. We arrived around 6pm on a Wednesday and walked right in, no wait. To make it even better, we got our own booth. Our server, clearly up to his ass in alligators, did his best tending to the half dozen or so tables under his purview but, in all honesty, things were a tad slow and felt a bit disjointed. I didn't mind so much, though, because I was enjoying the chitty chat with the wife and nursing my Hop Jam black IPA. Our entire experience was about 90 minutes from order to check.  Speaking of the beer, the brewmaster at WBC definitely knows what he's up to when it comes to a mash tun and some hops. The works of art he has created would stand up against some of the larger and more experienced brewers anywhere in the country. Some of my favorites are Gutterpup robust porter, dark, murky, chocolaty and smooth, and the Spring Saison, a spicy, mild Belgian style ale perfect for sessions. My wife is a huge fan of the peanut butter cup coffee porter.  The menu is a nice mix of standard bar fare (wings, burgers, nachos) and some larger entrees kicked up high-class bar style. The prices are on par with most restaurants of their ilk but some of the classier entrees will set you back a few clams - the beef filet clocks in at just shy of $30 and the lobster gnocchi comes in at $22. Here's how our meal went:  Bavarian Pretzels - I love soft pretzels. Throw craft beer into the equation and I can't help myself. It's totally empty calories and I don't care. The pair of pretzels are as big as your face, cooked a perfect dark brown, salted and feature an oh-so-soft and chewy inside. They are everything a pretzel needs to be. I wasn't too impressed with the trio of dips (honey mustard, spinach con queso, & cheese) as I found them a tad bland. And when will places start serving cream cheese with their pretzels?  Bibb Salad w/Chicken - Not a bad offering. The bibb lettuce was plentiful and bright green fresh and there's just something about the interplay of the bleu cheese and candied pecans that I just can't get enough of. The raspberry vinaigrette is very sweet so use sparingly. Oh, and how about an actual chicken breast next time. I would be surprised if it came with more than 4oz of it.   Sweet Potato Fries - Done shoestring style, the sweet tater fries were a bit on the chewy side and not all that hot by the time they arrived at our table. Good, but I've had better.  Fried Green Tomato Melt - My wife ordered this one and her assessment was that it was pretty \"one note\". Not that it wasn't tasty, just kinda boring. The fried green tomato, goat cheese, and sun-dried tomato were all tart, and the red onion was a bit lost in the shuffle. The onion rings, battered not breaded, were crispy and sweet.  All in all, not a bad place to grab a bite and sample some hand-crafted ales. The atmosphere is nice and they do have a sizable outside patio if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Dined and drank here on a recent Saturday night. I'm glad I made a reservation and was able to sit on the dining room side (rather than the bar side).  Call me a hater or an urban elite or whatever, but when I think of dining in the suburbs, my expectations are extraordinarily low. Being a decent non-chain restaurant in this part of town automatically earns a bonus star. Plus I want to cancel out the reviewers who docked this place because they can't get over their insecurities about the parking lot.  Let's start with the beers. I was pretty happy with the draft list. There were some unique offerings (like the Peanut Butter Cup Coffee Porter and Cosmic IPA) and well as some solid other choices. 4-ounce pours are only a buck each so you can definitely try everything that have on tap and not break the bank.  The food was better than average pub food. But don't come here expecting fine dining. For this reason I probably wouldn't order any of the $20ish entrees from the menu. But if you come for pub food and stick to that, you'll be OK."}
{"text":"Nostalgia, exciting, entertaining, charming, delicious, friendly, open, vintage. My husband and I went here on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch and boy was it worth the trip across Cleveland to the eastern side. I got the bacon, egg and tomato cheeseburger and my husband got the mac and cheese. Both were true winners and the beer was really great for a local brewery. No complaints!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. The crowd that this place drags in is very weird, super young or super old. On a crowded night it takes wayyy to long to get served and food is over priced. If it wasnt for their live bands, I think they would barely get business. Oh and by the way, stay away from there on Thur nights."}
{"text":"Delightful biz lunch.  Jennifer took great care of us, prompt service, refilled beverages, smiles!"}
{"text":"I like this place! Lots of good beers to try, but I only had their brown, which was tasty. They are apparently known for their peanut putter porter, but that's not something I wanted to attempt on a night out of drinking...   Late night on weekends the brewery converts from just a brewery to a dance club. From 11p-12a they played awesome music and we danced our booties off like we were still in college. From 12-1am, they music sucked and every song sounded exactly the same (I don't wanna F with youuuuu!). Apparently I'm old and just don't like today's hip hop. After 1am the music got a little better again - every 3rd or 4th song was danceable again.   The drink prices are fair and the bartenders were nice enough.   The only thing I'd suggest is to have a coat check! It is NOT fun trying to dance the night away either wearing a heavy winter coat or having it slung over one arm while carrying a drink in the other."}
{"text":"I have had many bad experiences but today was the worst.  Once again inlaws choice.  The only good thing I can say about willoughby brewing company is their soft pretzel was very good.  We got the appetizer platter and it was the only thing good on it.  We did not have napkins or silverware and waited with our appetizer platter for about 10 minutes before getting utensils. Our meal came much much later. Everyone at the table did not like their meal. Two  people got the steak and said it was tough.  I got the sante fe salad which sucked!  My husband got a sandwich and the fries were ice cold.  The service sucked as did the food.  It is a shame."}
{"text":"Came tonight with my peeps for a group happy hour. We met in the side room - facing the parking lot. The bartender was not visible upon arrival but after more ppl showed up, he became more visible?. . Food was good- we just had apps but was better than expected. The drinks were reasonably priced.  Kicker: as we waited for the valet to bring our car,  drunk (or upset guy) came out of the door and flung the door open so HARD, he knocked the valet stand over with all the keys, got in his car and tried to (possibly) run us all over as he drove away. The valet escorted me to a safe location until the the crazy man backed up at 100 mph and finally drove away.   I appreciate the concern of the valet and over all, a good experience. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Best place I've been to in a long time! Every beer they make is fantastic. Great food selection too unlike many breweries. It's a classy place with good taste and high quality food and beer. If you like sports there are big screens everywhere, if you like to dance they even have A dance floor and live bands on weekends ( their website will tell you who is playing and when). Reserve a table and Expect to have a great night out!"}
{"text":"I agree with yelper Jen M--for lunch, WBC is a solid 3.5 stars, but I'll bump them up for their great service!  We didn't imbibe, but I hear their brews are quite tasty. Instead we opted for iced teas, the brewers pretzels and I ordered the chopped cobb salad. My Mom got herself the lunch combo with the turkey avocado sandwich with the house salad for only $6.99.   First, the pretzels were really delicious, fresh and perfectly seasoned with salt and a light, garlicy touch. The beer cheese dip was good, but a little too hoppy/bitter for my taste. I'd tone that down just a tad so you can enjoy the married taste of both the cheese and the beer. The mustard was spicy and tasty. My Mom's turkey avocado sammie looked divine on it's hearty whole grain bread, stacked high with aged cheddar and a basil aioli. She seemed like she was a fan. The house salad was rather plain looking, mostly green leaf lettuce, but it was HUGE. So much so I couldn't believe she got all that for only $6.99--I mean, what a deal! My chopped cobb was pretty good, nothing spectacular, but tasty. I appreciated that it was packed with toppings like egg, bacon, avocado, olives, tomatoes and grilled chicken. Speaking of, the chicken wasn't very seasoned at all and it was a little over-done, but not horrible.   Besides my the lunch deal my Mom got, I thought my salad was a little overpriced at $12 dollars. I always say this, but I wish restaurants would be more realistic about how much green leaf lettuce really costs them. How is it that you can almost always get a sandwich for cheaper than an entree salad? But, again--holy lunch combo deal. I'd come back just for that!   Lastly, our server was super-helpful without being overbearing. He flowed with us as we added another diner on to our table last minute and threw an order in really quickly for her. The food was out just in time for her to arrive. I mean, in the resto-industry that's really important! Well, this gent (I didn't catch his name but he was serving out on the covered patio) had it down pat, with a smile. He even separated our checks without the blink of an eye.   I'm definitely planning on coming back to try out dinner and beers here. It's really a gem in the Downtown Willoughby 'hood and the rest of the menu looks pretty damn good. I hear their burgers are popular and who could pass on the buffalo chicken eggrolls?"}
{"text":"Had a pretty good experience here, but the food wasn't quite 4-star.  We went on a Sunday evening so the atmosphere was very family friendly. I enjoyed the pretzels with the three dips.  My sandwich was ok, nothing specific to complain about it but also nothing that was amazing. Appreciated their flexibility with having a kid in tow.  I was impressed that my side of broccoli was almost three servings of broccoli.   I would return here if I was in the area and craving a hot pretzel, because that was quite yummy, just not sure I'd order anything else."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Some of the beer is good, some is awful. Staff can be overworked it feels. Don't go late on a Friday or Saturday; turns into a club at night with atrocious loud music and everyone is drinking Coors light."}
{"text":"Great place to go for your late night drinking activities. Always has a large group of young men and women looking to drink and relax after a long work week. Drinks are cheap and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Amazing beer, Not so amazing prices  Amazing food Not at all amazing prices   You order Pierogies- I think it's $11 you get like 6 of them only...for $11?!?!!! Are you insane? I could've went to toco local or Frank and Tony's and ordered 2 things for that is triple the amount of food for that price. I understand it's nice in there, but not $11 for a app nice hahaha.  Other wise the place is great!!!  Y"}
{"text":"We come here often for their beer.  It's good pizza tho specials r tuff. Had blacken grouper and wow under cooked and old fish. who knows so if u come here get the beer and pizza ONLY!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very cool setting! I did not have the chance to eat here (this was our first and last stop of a barcrawl), but the beer was tasty and very reasonably priced; a pint ranged from $4-5. I tend to prefer darker beers, but their Porters were heavy on the coffee flavor (not my taste). Instead, I had their spiced winter ale, and I really enjoyed it. The bartenders were accommodating and allowed us to try a couple before we made a decision.  The place is huge and the atmosphere was fun. I can see this being a good place to have a large group celebration, or even a first date if you were looking for something low-key."}
{"text":"Their beer must be amazing because this is a just an ordinary restaurant. I've had to go here several times for special events, and the spinach salad or shrimp pasta is about as daring as they get. The food menu is anonymous and uninspiring, so unless you're a craft beer person, skip this establishment."}
{"text":"My review... Let's see. I had the BBQ beer burger. Not a fan. I ordered it medium but it had a burnt taste to it. It had a hint of bitterness to it that I was able to hide with ketchup.  My wife had the cheddar beer soup. She found it to be bitter with the consistency of curdled cheese.  The risotto crab cake would be really good however it was burnt.   Our server Megan was fabulous though and very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Great brew pub! Family friendly, good beer, great food! Got the pulled pork (good) bacon Mac and cheese (amazing) and Brewco. Burger (fantastic). Left with a Crowler. Good service too."}
{"text":"I'd lean more towards a 3 1/2 stars, but the general friendliness of the staff (our server was great) and atmosphere of the place makes me choose 4  stars since I don't have that option.  I'm from Chicago and visit my bro in Cleveland on occasion, and love checking out local breweries and brewpubs, so this place was a natural choice.  Built in an old brick building, the WBC is nice and spacious, with seperate dining areas as well as a bar area that faces the brewing equipment; I always dig seeing what the brewers are working with. We had just recently eaten lunch, so we kept it to pints, and a little later the appetizer sampler just to see what kind of food they were working with.  The beers were pretty solid, and reasonably priced. I think the Bitter they had on special may have been a bit off, but the IPA was great, and the Pale Ale was tasty. The Blonde was expectedly tasteless (gotta have an option for the Macro crowd, so I don't hold it against 'em).  All in all, our group was satisfied.  The food was pretty good too, I dug the Buffalo Chicken Egg rolls, they were a lot like Hopcat's in Grand Rapids, MI. Again, we didn't get much of a taste of that though.  Plan on hitting this place up again when I'm in Cleveland area again just to see if they can make a decent entree, and enjoy that IPA and some newbies as well."}
{"text":"The general manager did reach out and was very apologetic about the experience we did have. Was very polite and offered to resolve the issue."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill with the new ownership. Many of the pizzas are much smaller for same cost. Service was slow and they never have one of the original beers \" Railway Raz\""}
{"text":"The beer here is good and they should probably just stick to brewing beer. We went on Saturday afternoon for lunch.  It was not crowded and we sat inside in a quiet section.  My son was anxious and antsy so I immediately placed an order for French fries.  The rest of our party arrived, but the French fries never did!  We ordered our meals and they took what seemed to take FOREVER!  The food was fine, but there was no reason it took so long to arrive. We were almost charged for the missing fries.  No idea what was happening in the kitchen and our waitress all but disappeared once we got our food."}
{"text":"The best.  A brewpub with terrific food as well as first class beer.   And I don't know what the history of this old brick building it's in, but it makes for a great setting.  I had the pike sandwich - lightly breaded and not greasy at all.  The spinach cheese appetizer, a staple of pubs, was the best I've ever had.  And I don't have time to talk about how great the beers are.   It's hard to find a good porter anywhere and they usually have at least two killer porters on tap.  I can't get enough of this place.   Treat yourself to this place."}
{"text":"This place is good if you're just looking for your typical bar scene & clubbing scene, and you want to be able to not deal with street parking. The place is huge, it has your typical drinks, and they have live bands performing.  Other than that, there's really not much unique about the Willoughby Brewing Company. Been here three times and all because of needing a large group seating or just in the mood to get some drinks down me and dance the night away. :)"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, kind of small menu my daughters cajun pasta came out and was so spicy she gasped for air and refused to eat it with eyes watering she asked for a bix as to not offend anyone and took it home to toss out, i enjoyed the spinach and pork fat salad amazing flavor."}
{"text":"Found this gem on Yelp and it didn't disappoint. The menu is full of great choices and both food and drink. Appetizers include the wings , salad and large pretzels. On the menu are steaks, burgers and chicken. Drinks include Beer. and Wine and other spirits. The wait staff is very friendly and helpful. Prices are about average. They do have live music on the weekends. They are located off the main street and have Valet parking which cost $5.00, but they will take it off your check after the meal."}
{"text":"I was never a huge fan of their food, but was willing to give them another chance. Then they just didn't show up for a prearranged event with my employer. After the owner confirmed, they didn't show and when contacted, claimed to know nothing about the event."}
{"text":"WBCo has a wide variety of food and beer choices on the menu. I have visited several times and had a great meal on each visit. I would recommend the Mac and cheese, which you can spice up (literally), as well as adding veggies, chicken or different sauces. If you're in the mood for fish, I would recommend the shrimp linguine. The only downside is the service runs a little slow, especially on weekend nights when the bar fills up with the party- goers."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! Our server, Jim, was fantastic!  All of the servers definitely do their best to make sure your happy and taken care of! The turkey burger is outstanding!  It's so hard to get this burger right! But they nailed it! Actually everything we all ordered was good! They could use an upgrade on the AC though! IT was so hot sitting up top! Down below was much cooler! :-)"}
{"text":"Our yearly holiday tradition.  Came in for some beers and lunch.  We started with the Bavarian Pretzels with a flight of beers.  We loved them all.  Lunch we split a burger & fries.  Love coming in at this time of year.  Everyone is happy.  Thankful to live close the downtown Willoughby.  It's a total gem!"}
{"text":"Willloughby Brewing was a pleasant surprise after the other mediocre meals I've had in the Cleveland suburbs. Our business dinner started out with a couple of appetizer platters hat had some very tasty egg rolls and quesadillas (from a brew pub, who knew?). Many of the people in my group enjoyed the walleye. I'm not a big seafood eater, so I went with the pork chop, which was flavorful and well-cooked. One of my co-workers ordered the prime rib sandwich and very much enjoyed it. I only had a bite of the chocolate cake that was ordered for dessert, but it was quite decadent. A nice way to polish off the meal.  The building definitely had some charm, with a brick exterior, some big windows, and a model train running on overhead suspended tracks. Our service was attentive and pleasant. I was the DD for the evening, but the beer list looked fairly extensive.  If I'm ever back in the area, I would definitely keep this place in mind."}
{"text":"If 3.5 stars was an option, that is where I would be.  This rating is more reflective of my opinions of the beer than the food or service and I was coming here for the beer.  If I was rating on food or service, I would give them 4 stars.  The bartender was nice, knowledgeable, and great at his job.  He made great food suggestions and he was right.  Our food did take a little longer than it should have because there was a mix up in the kitchen.  However, it was good and there were no issues otherwise.  We went when they were in transition of beers, so there was not the biggest selection.  I was not super in live with what I had.  They were not bad, however, I would not necessarily make the trip out here again for the beers that I did have.  I will have to try again and try some different beers."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I make a trip to Cleveland. Easy to find and plenty of parking in \"DTW\". While I've been here probably 10 times, I've only eaten once.   I come to sample the delicious beers, especially the venerable Peanut Butter Cup Coffee Porter, which is of course just a variation of the flagship Gutterpup Porter. The Cosmic IPA reminds me of a taste of home in Seattle where most local breweries have a similar hop profile beer.  Highly recommend trying one of their samplers, each is a 3oz pour and only $1 each!"}
{"text":"This is the most tasteless food I think I have ever had. Ordered a BYO burger with swiss, mushrooms & onions and the regular toppings and NOTHING had any flavor. There was no mayo or mustard or ketchup on it and we were given an empty bottle of ketchup just before or waitress disappeared. There were two other people at the table with burgers who had the same \"experience\". The fries were good, but, the rest was a train wreck. Service was non existent. It took almost a half hour to get our food, and equally as long to get our check after we were done eating.. We will never be back."}
{"text":"I've recently become somewhat of a beer lover and have traveled to various places in Ohio and elsewhere to just try new beers and Willoughby's was a pleasant surprise. The place was much bigger than anticipated and I loved the modern yet homey comfort of the entire restaurant/bar. We enjoyed a flight of ALL the beers along with an appetizer at the bar and had a lovely time. The beers were good (although the peanut butter cup is one of my all time faves) and the food was better than okay. The prices were a little high for what it was, but the ambiance was different than most breweries I've visited. Definitely worth a trip in you're in the area or love good beers!"}
{"text":"Whenever I come back to Cleveland, this is always a place that I return to.  The mashed potato pizza WAS fantastic back in the day.  We had a table of 10 this past time and every one of our meals was awful, just pathetic.  Probably will not go back."}
{"text":"Burgers were damn good.  Who knew jean shorts were in style? Loud 80's music!  Welp, that about sums up my review. I don't think I've ever been as brief with a Yelp review, but the Haiku says everything you need to know about WBC. Oh, they also brew their own beer..... To the max! (80's slang)."}
{"text":"Hello,   I am writing to express how I upset and angry I am about our experience at the Ugly Sweater Party tonight 12/23/13. My brother has been looking forward to this event since last year. He put a lot of effort and time into creating his ugly sweater. He was your greatest promoter telling people about the event, posting reminders on Facebook and getting people excited.  We arrived at the event at 9:00 p.m. as was the stated start time of the event. We waited and waited for the contest to begin. We were told this would begin at 11:00 p.m. 11:00 p.m. came and went and still no contest. During this time, we were having drinks and mingling with the crowd. Many people were very very drunk. We were not. Once midnight came around we asked about the contest and the bartender told us it would be at least another 30 minutes? Why would you wait to hold this contest until half if not more of your patrons are good and drunk? We waited some more. At just about 12:30 a.m. a guy and his girlfriend began to fight and plowed into our group. The boyfriend fall back into my brother and his friend. My brother regained his balanced and once again joined out table. The guy and the girl resumed their fight on the dance floor. The next thing we know, Rob, the head of security is escorting my brother away from the table. We thought they were preparing him for the contest. Much to our disbelief they were escorting him out? We couldn't believe it?? What was happening?? We find out that he was being accused of grabbing some guy's behind? We are all confused? That is not what happened at all. If he would have grabbed this guy's behind wouldn't their have been some sort of confrontation? Where was this guy that my brother supposedly grabbed? My brother did not do this. He did not grabbed anyone's behind. It really feels like he was targeted because his sweater was so elaborate and he stood out in the crowd. My brother is an upstanding citizen that has never been in trouble a day in his life. He was wrongly accused. The head of security wouldn't listen to anything. He even go really disrespectful to me when I was trying to explain what happened. Now, my brother did get really upset when he found out what was happening and rightfully so. He was completely innocent and treated very badly. He worked so hard for this event and was so excited. It seems a little suspicious to me that we were kicked out 5 minutes before the contest? This was so upsetting, embarrassing for all of us. If this is the way you treat your customers that is really too bad. I would never feel safe returning to your establishment. Rob was unprofessional and really seemed like he was trying to escalate my brother. For example, my brother said I would like the name of your store manager and Rob replied this isn't a store? Was that really necessary. It is safe to say we will never return to your restaurant and will be sure to tell others of our experience. This is so upsetting I cant even put it into words. I feel bad for people who attend your establishment and fear that this same thing may happen to them. Thanks for putting a dapper on our holiday.  This is an email i sent to the GM. I have heard nothing back. What a lousy company. If i could give negative stars i would"}
{"text":"Been here many times over the years.  Ill keep it short and sweet.  Beer was on a steady decline for last 10 years or so but this new kid knows his stuff and can brew his ass off.  Sadly, he has to brew Bud Lite clones to appease the Midwestern housewife palette.  The food is acutally pretty good.  Those pretzels are great and I would naked wrestle Butterbean is a Turkish bath house for some of those on a steady basis.   The look of the place is unique and that little train up top is fun to watch.  Why three stars ya ask?  The hostesses are always awful.  They dont acknowledge you at all or are too busy talking to Johnny Crepo guy who's 47 and has 3 kids and a wife at home.  The servers are either really good or downright dreadful as well.  Recently, this place made the news....some dude was all drunk and pissing on customers on the patio.  HE knows how to party and the uppity patio people need to loosten up.  If your just having a beer (or seven) go to 1899..if ya want food as well, come here.  Its a crap shoot though!"}
{"text":"Lots of fun here and the beer options are plentiful.  We tried the streak fries and weren't disappointed!  My favorite beer was the Irish stout. I wasn't as fond of the coffee stout...but I'm not a coffee drinker."}
{"text":"We are sooooo glad that we stumbled upon this place today. We are visiting from Florida and we love to find unique foods and atmospheres. This was a great place to hang out, inside or outside (minus the pesky bees) and the food was amazing! We tried 3 different beers and our waiter was awesome. They have a kids menu and lots of different options to choose from. I looooooved my turkey burger, my husband had their specialty burger and my aunt had a burger as well. Come to think of it, so did my daughter, lol! Definitely a great place to stop in!"}
{"text":"Can't believe how downhill this place has gone.  The bar area smells and the place is filthy.  Do they not see the dust?  Been going there since it opened.  No more."}
{"text":"Have been there a few times and was a guest of friends of the owner and we were treated like family.  Good food and love the beer sampler."}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple times and have never been super impressed. Even so, I always hoped that it was just an \"off night\" and have kept it on the table as a local, quick dinner option. I'm coming to the conclusion that I may just have to stick with beer and cocktails here :/    Besides the food, it's always a good option for grabbing drinks with friends on the weekends."}
{"text":"I recently visited this restaurant/brewing company for a friend's bachelorette party dinner and was extremely impressed! I am not a beer fan by any means but I tried the peanut butter cup coffee stout and the raspberry beer and was a fan of both! The food was way better then your average pub food, the pretzel appetizer is awesome! We had a great view of the sports games going on and although they had a mediocre band playing it wasn't so loud that we couldn't have a conversation. If I am ever in the area again I will be back, although seeing as it's in the Cleveland area and I live in Detroit - it's not a town I visit frequently. Great place however!"}
{"text":"This spot is tucked away behind the main shops/bars in downtown Willoughby. The buffalo chicken pizza is probably my favorite thing on this menu, and overall I'd say the food is a lot better than at Great Lakes Brewery. The beer is pretty good, but the few times I've been there they've been out of a few that I've wanted to try. Great atmosphere for kids, especially with the train that runs the length of the restaurant overhead."}
{"text":"You would think with all the new competitors that have come to downtown Willoughby, they would have stepped up their game. The restaurant is showing its age and is in need of a face-lift. The staff is super friendly and helpful, but the food is lacking originality and quality. After 40 minutes, I received my cheeseburger which was a frozen 6 Oz. tasteless patty. The bun was too big, and while I ordered it with mushrooms, there were only 3 or 4 buried under the cheese. As for the beer, more than half of their beers were dark. After looking around the bar, bud light seemed to be the winner. Time to step up the food and decor"}
{"text":"5 stars for their beer. The Cosmic IPA is outstanding. I wish I could add a second rating for the food. As it is about 1 star at best.   Go with the Bavarian Pretzel it is supremely dank. Everything else on the menu sounds like it's going to be great but tastes like something you could make at home.  Great atmosphere for grabbing a beer or two at night! My girlfriend and I are far from the typical crowd that hangs out here but we felt very welcome and had a great time."}
{"text":"A strong three stars. The beer was nice and the full sampler was a bargain. Most were bit hop-obsessed for my liking (yes, I know most cool kids like that nowadays), but the peanut stout was really good and innovative. Nice food with ample portions and very quick and attentive service. The space is huge and about what you'd expect from a brewpub. If it wasn't halfway to Pennsylvania, this Westsider would be a more frequent flyer here."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant last week.  Naturally the beer is great!  The food was OK.  We have found it difficult to go with a larger group because of the seating.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I have heard that this place was turning the corner and becoming a great option for beer and food.  I went with a couple of friends and met the brewmaster (Rick) who was very polite, not snobbish at all and very accommodating of our questions.  We tried a few of their beers and I was impressed with 3 of the 4 with of course the Peanut Butter Cup Porter being the show stealer.  The only beer that didn't seem to resonate with me was the German Alt, which was just average in my opinion.  We went when appetizers were half price, so that was fantastic.  We tried the pizza and the buffalo chicken egg rolls and both were good.  Although I didn't stay for dinner I did notice that the menu prices for the entrees were a bit pricey.  I'm not sure that this place commands these kind of prices, but what do I know.  With all of this being said, I would go back again for a quick bite and a beer any time I am in the area.  Quick side note on the bartender...he was accommodating, just a bit robotic with the overall service...needs to chat a bit, especially when you are not slammed."}
{"text":"I'll start with \"Go to Willoughby Brewing Company for Dinner.\" But it pains me to say that you can't visit a restaurant at any time and have a great experience. I've been here before for a dinner meal and everything was great. We went for Father's Day because my husband loves their beer and food.   We got there at noon and about 7-10 tables were filled. They seat our party of eight promptly. We receive a brunch menu with build-your-own crepes as the highlight with about 10 other options. I asked if they were offering their regular menu and they said no, not until 2pm. We were a little sad since that is part of why we chose WBC. And what an odd time to switch but we made do.  My husband and I split a burger, that was really good, and he ordered a crepe too. He comes back with a crepe that looked, well, manhandled. The girl at the crepe station had no idea what she was doing. She had a table in the middle of the restaurant with buckets of ingredients. The seven tables there must of had a run on the prosciutto because they were \"out of it.\"    I kindly sought out the manager to talk about these things:  Me: If we had known you were only serving brunch items we would thought about going elsewhere or coming later. Him: It's on the website. Me: Oh, I missed it (pulling out phone) can you show me?  Him: Oh, um, my IT guy said he put it up. He may not of.  Me: Ok, whatever but half of your menu is being butchered over there (pointing  to crepe station) Him: It's her first day Me: Maybe some training would be good before you put her out there, just saying.  I think they were trying something new and hopefully if the manager is reading, as a good one would do, you'll see that this new brunch plan is a BIG fail.  It's good to offer a brunch option but a) put it on your website and let people know they can't order anything else, b) let people order off the menu too, c) train your crepe-ist and d) make the crepes in the kitchen like a normal restaurant. No one wants to stand in the middle of a restaurant and wait for their food to cook."}
{"text":"Me and my roommate went here tonight for my bday dinner.   For drinks: I got the blood orange margarita. I highly recommend this drink. It was so so delicious. My friend got a jack and coke and he said it packed a mean punch    We got the platter as an appetizer. I loved this. It was so good; and it came  with a chicken quesadilla, chicken spring rolls, and hot pretzel bites equipped with 5 dipping sauces. So so good especially since you can mix and match the dips    For the entree I got the Mac and cheese with chicken. So good. Not too creamy and not too solid. It was perfect and had a breadcrumb crust. Solid dish.   My friend got the fish and chips and said it was super fresh. We also kept some of the sauces from the app and he dipped his fish in some different sauces. It was really cool to experiment    The service was great and super attentive. All in all it was a great experience.   Their beer selection is unmatched. Seeing as though they brew their own beer in house. I love the railroad razz. To die for    If you are in the area it is a must try!"}
{"text":"I recently gave this place a review of five stars and said such wonderful things about this place recently I have visited them again and unfortunately this time this experience was not as good as it should have been the first problem I had was with the valet company who left my headlights on in my car the entire night and well into the next day because I was too drunk to drive so I left my car there which I will be contacting the company to pay for the new battery my truck needed because they left it on also the first problem I had was with the valet company who left my headlights on in my car the entire night and well into the next day because I was too drunk to drive so I left my car there which I will be contacting the company to pay for the new battery my truck needed because they left it on also the rude and mean and treated everybody in my party like garbage very disappointed"}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Brew Co. for years and the food has never really stood out among the great restaurants in the area but it is very solid bar food. The beer selection is usually very good with some great seasonals. The service has always been excellent and the restaurant itself is very clean with a nice decor. I would definitely give this place a try if you want a good brew and burger."}
{"text":"We had reservations, when we arrived the Host was rude and seemed bothered and annoyed. Service was ok, food was sub par. Our table had ripped seats cushions. We took friends from out of town and were embarrassed ."}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices. Even better beer. I will be visiting again soon! Try the egg rolls. Can't go wrong. Also their award winning peanut butter cup is a delicious beer."}
{"text":"This is a very fun location with lots of live music, events for things such as charities, and it always has a great crowd. They have a huge bar indoors but also a great patio when the weather is nice. It's in the heart of downtown willoughby set back in a parking lot that makes it feel really industrial but in a good way.   The beer is okay, I've definitely had better and most of their food is decent but their build your own Mac n cheese and their burgers are delicious. We usually go more for the entertainment then anything else. The food could be way better but it fills you up and you will always have leftovers to take home (huge portions).   Willoughby brewing company is great for parties or events. I've been there for a birthday party where we reserved high top tables during a live band performance, we were just there for my bridal shower in their private room in the back, and I've seen charity events held there as well. The service is always great and the staff are really nice. Overall, fun place to go to."}
{"text":"We had dinner reservations for 5 people...when we arrived a hostess asked if we had reservations we said yes and gave our names and they asked you still have 5? and we replied yes. And then a gentlemen came by and said this is the booth you requested in the bar (which we did not) he said it in not gentle way and we said it was fine...not like the place was crowded all open tables. Not a great first impression. Then came the menu's we had looked on line before coming to Willoughby brewing the menu was different from the one on several postings so we were disappointed to say the least,. The waitress then asked if we wanted drinks and  we proceeded to ask if there was a happy hour special and she shrugged her shoulder and said only if you are sitting at the bar.  We were sitting in the bar area? Third strike as far as I was concerned...it took us a while to order our food since we had planned on ordering different items that weren't on the menu.  Then when we did decide they were out of pulled pork which is about 1/4 of the menu items. They did say they would replace it with pulled chicken?  My husband just ended up ordering soup he got the tomato basil he only finished 1/2 bowl he did not care for it.  I got the mashed potato pizza, my friends has gotten the mac and cheese and shrimp taco's and quesadillas.  We all agreed we would not be back to eat there only if they had a good band and have  some drinks.  We were really disappointed.  Our waitress must of told the manager about the disappointment of the menu items from online and he came over as were leaving and asked where we found it on line and said he would take it down.  We thought he might give us a coupon to come back at another time but nothing."}
{"text":"This place was a nice gem to find!!! We split a flight of their beers and they were all very flavorful! The pretzels are to die for as well!"}
{"text":"My company recently held their annual kick-off party at the WBC. I'd been here before a few years ago, so I was pretty anxious to see how it changed. My company had the place from 6 until 10 (or so I thought).  The staff was great. I got to go on a mini brewery tour and loved hearing about WBC's brew process. Unfortunately, I wasn't really impressed with the beer I tried. The Peanut Butter, in my opinion, was really overpowered by the coffee flavor. I couldn't find any hints of oatmeal in the Oatmeal Stout. However, the Gutterpup was the clear favorite amongst myself and others I spoke to. I would love to have that one again.  I didn't try any of the appetizers they had prepared, so I can't comment on those. For dinner, we had the choice of Steak, Scallops, or Butternut Squash Ravioli (sit-down dinner, not buffet). I had the scallops and I felt mine were a little underdone and a little too salty. The cheesy rice/risotto/something that came with it was, in my mind, inedible (lukewarm, very bland). But the carrots were great.  For dessert, there were lady fingers with a chocolate mousse dipping sauce, as well as a small tart filled with the mousse. The desserts just had no discernible taste. I likened eating the lady fingers to eating compressed air. Not a fan.  Apparently the open bar ended at 9:30, but the bar didn't make an announcement for my company. Would have been nice to have at least gotten a verbal announcement about it (but hey, this could be on my company too, so I'm not taking this into account when calculating my Yelp score).  When the band started playing and the public was let in at 9:30, I remembered why I don't go to Willoughby. The clientele of the place was this weird mix of really old and really young. Definitely not my type of crowd.  I could have been brutal and gave his place 2 stars, but the staff and the actual venue were really nice, along with the Gutterpup beer I loved. I hope the food from the real menu isn't as bad as the food we were served as part of the event. Might come back and see how the menu dinner is, but I definitely won't go back for nightlife."}
{"text":"One of our regular spots when I lived in OH. I went back in August and everything was just as I remembered. The choco-PB-coffee porter was perfect. And the buffalo egg rolls were awesome as always. We ordered pretzels for the kids as well and they were really good.  I like that the flights were updated. Now you pick any beer you want and get a taste for $1. The only downside was that a couple beers were out (this in the middle of the week).  I highly recommend as a meet-up spot for apps and drinks. They also have a back room for groups. Be forewarned, though... Depending on the band they have at night, the crowd can get a little weird."}
{"text":"I have gotten the pleasure to eat here on 2 of my previous Cleveland trips and had good experiences both times.  The beer options are great!  I really enjoyed the raspberry beer and would love to have it again.  The food was good - I got a salad and some co-workers got burgers that they loved.  We had pretty big meals for a good price.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"There was no hostess to seat us, although the sign said to wait to be seated.  So we were standing around and were ignored.  We finally flagged someone down who was not really interested in customers; she told us only the bar was open.  Not friendly.  The alcohol is good here, but we never had the food as the kitchen closed at 10:00 pm.  (We arrived at 10:02.). They also had live entertainment, but it was so loud we couldn't talk to each other.  We had one drink and got outta there."}
{"text":"I was convinced that WBC was a solid 4 star rating until I stopped in over the weekend for a late lunch.  I knew ahead of time that the restaurant / brewery was under new ownership / management and that they decided to change everything around a little including the beer recipes and did a little menu revamping, but keeping the local favorites such as their pizza's, soups, and a few apps.  Here's my experience in a nut shell.  Upon arriving around 3pm on a Saturday we decided to bypass the hostess and sit at the bar.  The place was obviously in between lunch and dinner services because there was only 10 or so tables full.  Surprisingly, the parking lot was still relatively full, that has always been a problem for WBC and Gavi's.  I ordered the Toehead Blonde Ale and it was comparable to any light beer that you would get out of a bottle but with a little more bite / flavor.  We also wanted to try the Railway Razz to see if the brewers over tweaked the recipe since this has been a favorite of many, including the wife.  All I can say is that they should have left it the way it was, the razz fell short in flavor and was a little overwhelmingly bitter.  My second beer was the Peanut Butter Coffee draft which I really did enjoy but would comment by saying that the Peanut Butter flavor was a little lacking.  I will get again though in replacement of the razz.  Food:  I went with the new chicken chorizo melt with a side of veggies.  The veggies were nicely grilled which was a nice surprise but the highlight was the sandwich itself.  I absolutely loved it!  Messy, but good, only gripe would be the $10.99 price tag.  Wife went with potato cheddar soup which she said was just OK, she wished she would have went with the French Onion because we know we like that soup.  Her other choice was a side Bibb salad and that was good, generous with the Gorgonzola, which is ALWAYS a good thing.  Service: Not a whole lot of excitement behind the bar, seems like everyone was just bracing for the night to come.  We were well taken care of though even through the shift change at 4pm.  Overall: Mad about the Razz situation.  Happy with my food, so so with hers.  We were freezing cold the whole time we were in there but we just chalked that up as being our fault for sitting by the smoking entrance to the patio.  Given the parking situation and all the other food options in Willoughby, we really left WBC with a B- rating and will probably choose otherwise unless we are really craving one of their beers.  But their decor gets an A so stop in if its a first for you and the family."}
{"text":"If there is zero star can be chose, I'll go with that one.   Went there at 10/20/2013 around 6pm with group of 6. Ordered hummus as appetizer. Main entrees are potato pizza, LOBSTER GNOCCHI, ROASTED CHICKEN and burgers. 3 of us ended up having diarrhea in the middle of the night. Some came with the feeling of puking. 1 of us have acid reflex and lots of gas disturbing the whole night. Other 2 have some gas problem. Don't know what's going on with the food that evening but will definitely not going back again."}
{"text":"I like this place if it's a weekday before 10pm. The atmosphere is great and the fermenters behind the bar always make a great conversation piece. It has the same Ballantine/1899 style since owners are close to the same. The beers that are brewed in house are excellent, Toehead is my favorite. The peanut butter coffee is also worth trying. Food is pricey but a bit above average quality but not by much. Nightlife Is a different story, ladies night (Thursday) on into the weekend leaves much to be desired. The crowd is not the establishment's fault but it seems they do promote the cougars/divorcees' of lake county. But If you are looking for quality beers with good food or even a place to watch the game... Brew Co. Could be your spot"}
{"text":"I live in downtown willoughby, and this is a great place for dinner. The prices are normal for the area. The last time my boyfriend, and I went we had the mac n cheese with chorizo and the pulled pork sandwich. Both were really fantastic, and I was a little surprised. We shared the entrees and ate every last bite. With four drinks, the food, and tip our bill was about $65. I think that is very reasonable for the quality of food, and the server we had was very good. I bought a gift certificate from Restaurants.com, and we will be going again very soon."}
{"text":"So happy we happened to stop in here tonight! Every Tuesday kids eat for free! They had a magician, face painting, and balloon animals! It was so much fun for my little one!!   The kids pizza was the size for an adult! It was huge!! Such a great deal!!   They have so many gluten free options available.. it was so nice to see a menu catering to that population."}
{"text":"Just ok. Something for everyone to eat good atmosphere. Drinks are good and good value. Parking is an issue there the whole lot is owned by someone else and it's 5.00 valet. Not that's a big deal but with just ok place I'd rather go elsewhere and park for free."}
{"text":"Had a very fun lunch here!!!!  My boyfriend and I were able to spend a great Saturday afternoon on the patio. Sun was shining, the beer sampler was flowing, and food was delicious. However, there were a few decent hiccups.   We started off with the appetizer sampler which came with the pretzel (which was great!), the quesadilla, and buffalo chicken something with assorted dipping sauces. The pretzel was by far the best of the three and I wish we would have just went with that. Regardless, we enjoyed the sampler and the beautiful day. We then ordered the Turkey Avocado sandwich to split. We didn't even get to it -- eyes were WAY bigger than our stomachs!!! I did enjoy a few fries and they were excellent. Very crunchy and yet pillowey in the middle. They were great for \"french fries\". He enjoyed the sandwich later and said it was delicious.   Now onto why I only gave this place three stars:  1. The bee's - we were swarmed by three bee's for our entire lunch. To the point where we had to get up because they were on the beer and the food. The server's never asked us if we wanted to move or better yet -- told us to move. They didn't even acknowledge that we were jumping away from the table to avoid getting stung.  2. The service in general. Slow. Inattentive. It didn't start that way. I guess the bartender was our server. He got our drinks and took the appetizer order. Then basically never came back. The server was switched in the middle of our meal -- which is fine -- but she didn't come over till we were long finished with the sampler to ask if we wanted anything else.   Overall, it was a fun afternoon. I would go back if I was in the area, I would just sit inside."}
{"text":"great brews cool setting BUT NO perch  FROM RHE LAKE??? that's it i'll go somewhere else-"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was good. Service was adequate. They offer some interesting beers. Would try it again."}
{"text":"While on business in the Cleveland area, we stopped by here on two consecutive nights to try different beers.  This place is huge with tons of indoor and outdoor seating, but there was no one here.  The beer was alright, just not very flavorful for my tastes.  Service was ok, but I think they were understaffed as the bartenders on both days were running around quite a bit to other areas.  They have a large food menu, but we did not eat here.  My biggest problem was with the dust hanging from the rafters.  A couple dust balls floated down on a couple of occasions.  I get the whole \"old building\" vibe, but I don't like dust in my beer.  I also noticed the same dust was hanging over the brewing equipment.  Not sure how good or bad that is, but made me think twice about ordering anything else.  I really wanted this place to be cool.  The venue looks nice.  But I hate dust in my beer."}
{"text":"We loved the  atmosphere and will definitely be back to hear bands and to sit outside during the warmer months. The food was great also!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Willoughby Brewing whether it's to hang out with friends for a beer or for lunch with the family.  On my most recent visit I tried the beer flight (I usually just order a pint) and it was definitely worth the $7. I had a sampling of 6 or 7 beers that were filled to the brim. A bit tipsy after all the good brew.  Great appetizers - the spinach dip or pretzel appetizer is always a treat. I had the chicken with pretzel coating and even though the portion was pretty big I managed to eat almost all of it."}
{"text":"Ok I'm going to give it 5 stars for now, but honestly I was here for about an hour. I was meeting a group of friends and I was seriously just stopping by!  I didn't try the food I had a couple of sample beers that were pretty interesting. So with that said will write something more detailed, when I spend more time here."}
{"text":"So you're on that long drive between Detoit and New York City.  You started off mid afternoon and have endured Cleveland rush hour and now you're hungry.  Pull off at Willoughby and try the Willoughby Brewing Company.  It's a little hard to find but if when you get downtown and look to the left down the alley you can spot in.  The place is pretty big.  Two main rooms and an outside patio.  We grabbed the outside (first come first served) because it was a nice day. I think the beers are hit and miss.  I liked the Third Planet but the porters that I tried were a little too sweet for my taste.  I liked the Mac and Cheese and the burgers were great.  Now that we know how to find it, it will be a regular stop on the path between the East and the Midwest."}
{"text":"Buffalo Chicken Egg Rolls.  If you go there for no other reason, this alone will make it worth it!  I've found their food to always be satisfying and they offer a martini and wine list along with their microbrews.  We've never had the pleasure (?) of hearing any of their bands or sitting in the bar area, but they always seem to be hosting some sort of event.    What I can't wrap my head around is their valet parking offering - it's a relatively small parking lot! Why would I pay you to park my car!?"}
{"text":"Beer - Definitely recommend for the beer. I tried three different options in a flight for $2 per small glass. My favorite was the Railway Razz, super good fruit beer. I also tried the IPA and pale ale - they tasted fairly similar, IPA wasn't that hoppy, but it was still good.   Food - I haven't been here in years, menu has changed a bit. I ordered tacos, they were not good. The chicken was dry, the braised beef had too much sauce on them. Definitely would not get the tacos again. Probably safer to get burger or pretzel, I'm guessing.   Restaurant - I like the interior of this place, it's very open with lots of seating options. Waitress was friendly, service was quick.   I will be back I'm sure, but will order something different next visit or just go for drinks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and music. Lots of sports on tvs.  The soft pretzel appetizers were amazing!   Comes with 3 different sauces for dipping.  They are huge!   Dinner was great.  Fish tacos, a chopped salad with chicken and grilled salmon.  Would def come back."}
{"text":"Last stop( no pun dude) on our Willoughby Yelp outing. We met up with yelper D and my father in law for a quick one at the brewery. Usual story- crowd was old losers, beer was really good, band was laughable. But the star count goes up, because we were on the patio taking in the freshly rained Lake County evening air, and having conversations about pot and food poisoning. I really had a ball all night. I could not have asked for better company. I'm thinking of reviewing individual yelpers.  The bier was a Rapier Wit which i think is sort of clever."}
{"text":"I had looked it up online so knew what it looked like. Therefore when my GPS announced \"you have arrived\" I worriedly looked around. Not to fear. It's behind the street front shops. Follow the signs for public parking and just before you get there turn left and you'll see it. They have a big private lot plus complimentary valet.   The waitress was really nice. As we were finishing up a table of 12 was sitting down and with a smile she offered them all separate checks and still was attentive to us.   The food was just good. I got what I thought to be the healthiest thing on the menu - the Airline Chicken with Sweet Potato succotash (which is basically sweet potatoes plus corn) and broccoli. The chicken was a good portion - 2 pieces and a lot of white meat, but perhaps cooked a bit too long.   Cool area though - next time, and preferably not in the winter, I'd save some time to walk around."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lunch to celebrate a graduation, we had reserved a table for eleven and no issues upon arrival. You don't leave here hungry that is for sure. I had chicken wings and potatoes and it was good. Service was really good also. Everyone in party enjoyed their food. My wife had the onion soup and raved about it. Closer to a 4.5."}
{"text":"Attended The Wedding Walk this weekend that started at the Brewing Company.  Obviously it wasn't its typical scene, but I have been there so many times, I can still give an overall review.  I love their 2 patios, and because the weather was so nice, we were able to take great advantage of these today.  It was even better because it wasn't as crowded as usual, so we could sit down and enjoy some of the great appetizers provided by the restaurant.  I loved the spinach and artichoke dip and chips, as well as some of the other passed apps.  Other times I have eaten here, I have ordered the French Onion soup, the hot pretzels, the chicken salad and the chocolate peanut butter dessert.  The onion soup is always good (ask for the cheese well done!), the pretzels come with several sauces - they are also part of the appetizer sampler, which is a great idea if you want a bit of everything.  The salads are HUGE!!  And although I am not a dessert person, the fresh whipped cream stole me heart.  For my visit yesterday, I got to see some rooms I didn't know existed and walk around freely.  And, luckily for me, I didn't get peed on by the guy who got arrested there over the weekend (read it on Cleveland.com!)"}
{"text":"This is downtown Willoughby's gem for dining and socializing and my favorite place to show off when friends come in from out of town. This has been my hometown since the 1960s, so I remember it as a sleepy, peaceful place growing up. Now, as an adult, I appreciate how vibrant it has become and the Willoughby Brewing Company can take pride in being the place that pretty much helped the town become a favorite hotspot in northeast Ohio.  Each time I've been here the service and the food have been excellent. I'm not a real beer aficionado, but I guarantee this place has a brew for everyone, even me. I thought I liked only wheat ales until I came to WBC and tried a sampler flight of about five different beers with my girlfriend. That's when I discovered their Creme Bulee porter, which has a great coffee tone that isn't overbearing.  The bar servers are quite knowledgeable about their brews as well as their food and the service at the bar and at their tables have been friendly and exceptionally attentive.  The food menu is enjoyable--something for every palate. Burgers are hearty and juicy, and the pizza was absolutely perfect for me. I recently got to try their Poutine, a plate full of French fries topped with smoked pulled pork, brown gravy, and cheese with an over easy egg at the very top. That was a tasty heap of decadence, especially the smoked pork.  This place can get really packed when bands play, making it difficult to navigate the bar area. It's a popular nighttime hotspot, so if you're thinking of coming on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared.  I couldn't give a full five star rating because I get frustrated with parking there. It becomes valet only at a certain time and the lot is just a sea of cars. You're better off parking one street over by the old City Hall where parking is free and you can walk around a bit to become acquainted with the town (now affectionately and fashionably referred to as \"DTW\")."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that you are a FOOL if  you order Miller Lite or Bud light at this establishment. Phew. That felt good.  I came here on a Friday night and decided to get a flight of all the beers they had on tap that night. I was not disappointed! My favorites were the Peanut Butter Cup Coffee Stout and the Railway Razz. The stout had the perfect mix of chocolate and peanut butter and made me really wish they bottled the stuff. SO GOOD. The other offerings were good, but I'm not big into hops so they weren't my thing.  I also ordered a pork quesadilla from the appetizer menu and it was really good! It came in three pieces, but it was big enough for dinner. I'm not sure of the cheese they used in it, but man, I want that all the time. I would highly recommend ordering it.   The staff were all really friendly and knowledgeable and made my experience all the much better. I will definitely be back and you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you don't stop by!"}
{"text":"Good beers. Good food. First tried the beer at a brew fest in Columbus, OH. On our way to Toronto, we stopped in for lunch. The China Town hoagie with Korean BBQ meatballs was excellent. Our server suggested the chicken spring rolls which were good as well. Looking forward to the time when we can get their beer in Columbus."}
{"text":"Went to Cleveland to see college friend get married.   We stopped here to kill some time for the long weekend.  I really did enjoy this place.  The scenery inside was rather cute and different.  The beers are all brewed there and the food is nothing short of delicious.   They are really known for their different pizzas. (Mash Potato Pizza)  They have outdoor seating which is also great."}
{"text":"Although it was a hike, the beer and food did not disappoint. We've gone a couple times now and have been very happy with our selections.   I'm not a beer drinker, but the Peanut Butter Cup Porter is something you definitely need to try. Even if you don't drink beer so dark that it's like getting an oil change, you could still enjoy this particular one.  The food was great too. We started with an app of the egg rolls, followed by burgers. On our second trip I had a chop salad. Everything was pretty tasty and came out in a decent amount of time even though they were pretty busy.  There are two negatives though- 1. If you go at night, expect to pay for parking. In their own lot. I get there isn't much parking in downtown Willoughby, but come on. I'm not sure, but I believe you have to start paying around 5pm, and if you don't valet the car expect to walk a fair distance. Not bad in the summer, but terrible in the cold and snow.  2. Even though the food came out in a timely fashion, the service is overall slow. I get it's a huge place and when it's busy there is a lot to tend to, but both times we were there we waited FOREVER to get our check. And both times we saw our waitress just standing behind the bar socializing.  The above two aren't enough to keep us away if we're in the area, but the restaurant may want to address that second one."}
{"text":"Service is pretty consistently decent.  Beer is always fabulous.  NOT a fan of not being able to park anywhere close due to it all reserved for valet for the local bars/eateries.  Valet person was an ass when letting us know that we couldn't park in the parking lot of the place we wanted to eat.  This may be a deal breaker go forward."}
{"text":"My guest and I were in town on business and this place was highly recommended.  We ordered 2 burgers well done.  Burgers came out in a timely manner but were not well done.  I went ahead and ate mine while she sent hers back.  The 2nd burger came out and was cooked properly but had a hair sticking out of the burger patty.  After finally getting the waitresses attention she asked her \"are you still hungry\"?  She replied \"no\"!  Seriously? Then to add to it she informed me she would take her burger and beverage off the bill.  Not impressed Willoughby Brewing Company.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Family book club. They put us in a good section where we didn't bother anyone and likewise  cousins hubby ordered the mac n cheese with bacon  and started off with French onion soup   cousin ordered turkey burger and she loved it.  Sis ordered Mac n cheese with mushrooms  and brother n law got chicken tenders and fries. Dad ordered plain Mac n cheese. We ordered plate of different appetizers  pretzel was nice and soft and not too salty *braised short rib quesedia which he said was pretty @$! good  and chicken spring rolls  I shared that and French onion soup  cheesy . Of course we all had Willoughby brewing Co beer  wenceslas* ad I had pale German ale  sister and her hubby had sampler  over all nice evening"}
{"text":"To be fair, I'm not a huge beer fan.. so take this review with a grain of salt.  Came here to meet up with friends to discuss the details an upcoming trip - Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Service was decent, our waiter was very cool and casual, and pretty attentive.  They were all out of the beer that one of my fellow diners wanted. But, they had plenty of water (which is what I drank) and they kept my glass full! I ordered a shrimp avocado salad, it was one of the specials. It was pretty good, however, for the $12 price-tag, I would have like to have a bit more lettuce on the plate, however the flavors were decent, but nothing super special. The shrimp was cooked pretty well.  For dessert we ordered a large fried ice-cream for the table. It had a nice strawberry sauce on top and the \"fry\" coating was ok, but I thought it could have used some more cinnamon. Does not even compare to ChiChi's fried ice-cream but since that place is gone, and there aren't that many places that even serve fried ice-cream, they get points for even having it on the menu. It was good (really how can ice-cream be bad?), but again, nothing exciting.   Overall, this is a good place to meet up with friends and chat, but don't expect anything too fancy when it comes to the food."}
{"text":"Their build your own macaroni and cheese is fantastic, and it's big enough to share. Also, the buffalo chicken egg rolls are great. Their beers are good, not great. I love the raspberry one.  I have yet to experience this place on a busy weekend night; we usually go there for dinner on off nights. The servers are always attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Went here to grab a bite to eat after the rock and roll hall of fame. The Peanut Butter Cup porter beer is one of my favorites. The appetizers are huge. The spring rolls and quesadilla were delicious. The pizzas are also great and can be easily shared among 3 or more people."}
{"text":"Fabulous food!  Phenomenal beer!  Must try the Peanut Butter Cup Coffee Porter and the Nut Smasher!  Their chicken is Henny Penny deep fried and worth the wait!  Build your own Mac and Cheese!  Completely satisfied!!  Please make this a stop on your food journey!!"}
{"text":"Went there in the late afternoon for lunch & had a GREAT waiter, Nick. At the table was a Walleye Po Boy sandwich & a chicken salad. Both pretty good.  Nick was the best: bottomless coffee & very attentive. The dessert was not so great, new vendor, Costco has better stuff.  The green beans were marvelous, a certain surprise.  Went back the next night & others had ordered the green beans, based on my recommendation: I could tell at a glance that they wouldn't be as good as the previous afternoon, and they weren't.  Shared pretzels & had the Mac & Cheese with Shrimp.  The Mac & Cheese needs work, still better than most, yet not as good as Martha Stewart's: http://www.marthastewart.com/271998/perfect-macaroni-and-cheese  To sum it up: the first day they weren't busy & we got lots of attention, good food and a great waiter., The second time was at night, they were v. busy & the food wasn't as good as the first lunch, but still, much better than many of the local places.  Willoughby Brewing, we'll come back, but please work on your evening game!"}
