{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants in Brampton.  Everything always tastes super fresh and super tasty.  Quality is seriously lacking in a lot of Bramton Indian restaurants but that's not an issue here everything is high-quality.  I've tried almost all the vegetarian dishes as well as the fish tikka and fish pakora which are great.  The notable mentions are Achari paneer, chili paneer, fish tikka, gajar halwa, chat papri and Channa bhatura.   I've been going here for years - highly recommended :)

 I only wish they had halal chicken... so I could try the chicken dishes too."}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant!! I'm always there and it has the best food. I always get shai paneer and rice or choley patoorey (hope I spelled that right lol) but seriously their service is good, and it's always busy. But it's great"}
{"text":"I started coming here when an Indian friend brought me here for authentic Indian cuisine. The restaurant is busy with both dine in and take out customers. Customers are mostly Indian (you know a restaurant serves authentic and delicious food when it's packed with customers of their own ethnicity l). 

The food is very fragrant and SPICY - just the way I like it! 
Notable mentions: butter chicken - I normally don't like butter chicken because I sometimes find it it a little on the sweeter side. Sweet Palace is one of the few places that I like coming to for butter chicken. 
Chicken karahi - spicy and delicious ... Lotssss of chicken pieces . This is one of my favourites. 
Naan bread - made to order. Very fresh, and fluffy! 

Average cost for a meal would be $15 per person with large portions."}
{"text":"Love this place. Its right down the street from me so I do come here often. Have not yet tried their sweets but the food is amazing. I think we have tried pretty much everything on the menu and have not been disappointed. 
Samosa's are probably one of the best in GTA and staff is very friendly and polite"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurant in GTA based on my experience. I have been there more than 10 times now, mainly I have tried the following items during my visits -chicken tikka, sheek kabob, samosa channa, channa bhatura, Paneer & Chicken tikka masala, Karahi Chicken, Channa masala, Bartha. All of these are great tasting, fresh and consistent in taste. I haven't tried a lot of other items yet on the menu. The gulab jumun is great too. Service is pretty decent, I go there for good food."}
{"text":"My go to Indian food takeout in Brampton. The food, decor, staff are all exquisite. Would definantly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"My co workers and I get take out from this place at least one saturday a month.  Every dish we've ordered has been amazing.  The butter chicken (my fave) is big chunks of all white meat, the naan both plain and garlic are fantastic and the samosas are the best I've ever had.  Absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have to drive all the way to brampton to get their butter chicken. The butter chicken is mildly sweet but with a little bit of heat. Very well balanced. The rest of the food is also always fresh.  The customer service is outstanding. The place is located in a plaza and is not very big but the food quality and service is great. They also do take out. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick bite. Thali gives you good options with a sweet dish. Naans are fresh and parathas are especially good. Food has good flavor but seemed a little bland for my taste. Came here with family and the kids were happy. so that is a plus. In summary, good food and fresh naan is always a good combo."}
{"text":"Great food! Everything is very fresh and tasty. Service is a bit disorganized at times. But food makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"People taking orders are part of the restaurant experience... For Sweet Palace they will cut you up for critiquing they're service level... I watched the owners wife tell a customer not to come back if he didn't like cold somosas...turns out neither do I, so I also left! Never went back."}
{"text":"One of the best resturant if you wish to have Indian food. They do have buffet but we always ordered dishes from their menu. Anytime if we feel like having Indian food this is the place I will always go."}
{"text":"We placed a take out order of shahi paneer and naan which also came with pickles and an onion salad. It was good but the naan was too buttered down for my liking. From the yelp pictures, the butter chicken looks amazing and will definitely try that next."}
{"text":"I walked through the door of Sweet Palace and was instantly transported to India, I was in heaven.  A long presentation case of sweets leads you to the register. Above the case are boards listing all kinds of delicious Indian sides and dishes.  TVs in the dining area are blaring bollywood movies.  Ahhh, the smell of the food and the sweets was intoxicating.    The butter chicken looked amazing.  The saag paneer smelled awesome.  I got the chicken briyani and it blew my mind."}
{"text":"Confusing SCAM restaurant!!!

We usually order take outs from them. Minus the fact they sometimes 'accidently' sold our order to someone who got there quicker (you did not read wrong,it happened more than once), one person would charge us tax one day but not the other, sometimes we'd show up for an order to find out they didn't make it since the order was 'too small to start things up'...we grudgedly go back there for lunch because it's Brampton. There's no food option within the 5 km radius. This town makes me cry.

Today was last straw. Their take out menu for vegetarian dishes start at $3, and rice for $2.99. Their thali (3 tapas,rice, salad, yogurt, naan, desert deal) is $6.99. But when we sit down instead of ordering take out, they did not tell us prices start at $8.99 + tax. We walked out rightfully assuming our bill to be $10 or less, but it ended up being $29.50!!!!! How on earth did they design this menu?!?

I say, regardless of the quality of their food, these people should not be in business because service and business model this inept and scammy don't belong in Canada. Back to canned soup lunches for me!!!"}
{"text":"Curry was ok, nothing spectacular. Over priced for what you get. And they charge extra to dine in. I'm from the states and I've never heard of this practice. Sounds like they don't like cleaning up after paying customers. They don't ever have to complain about cleaning up after me ever again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here regularly for years for their Dine in. My go-to's are the Chole Bhature as well as their Thali with a mango lassi. The food is consistent in quality and always tastes great. Their naan are nice and soft and their bhature are huge, you definitively get your money's worth with both of those. The servers have changed over the years but they're almost always nice and polite and I've never had an issue with them at all. Great people. Great food. Great price."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Clean and roomy for a regular Indian restaurant. Delicious food all around. It's always busy so you know they have good turn around.  Their Tikka chicken and butter chicken are awesome.  Price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Veg thali & samosas are good. Can get busy during weekends. Decent restaurant in the area for north ind"}
{"text":"I don't usually like North Indian food but this place pretty good! Had the Channa Bhatura and grilled chicken. ( forgot the actual name). Both are very good."}
{"text":"Great family-style Indian restaurant with booths, comfortable and homey in a corner of a strip mall, packed with parked cars. It has the feel of a family run business. The menu is lush and colourful well laid out with all the favourites from India. Prices are decent too! Their naan came in quite a variety with the garlic naan tasty and fresh. Another favourite was their chicken wrap made with fresh naan wrapped around moist chunks of chicken with a zesty sauce, wow what a delightful spin on some classic ingredients and absolutely blows Tim Hortons chipotle wrap completely out of the water. No need to add extra sauces or anything like that to our food as it came to us piping hot, seasoned and flavourful. My shrimp Masala was excellent with plump juicy shrimp cooked just right. Our service was fantastic with a quiet guy who showed up exactly when we needed him, filling up our water glasses and bringing us all the good stuff. Kudos to the staff who were inundated with a festival going on nearby and the lineup for takeout and sweets going out the door, yet not missing a beat with the sit down customers. Very impressive! I'd love to visit again and try another dish or two."}
{"text":"*PUBIC HAIR FOUND in food* I'm usually very satisfied with my samosas from here. This is all I've ever ordered. Granted the line up is chaotic and they never have the amount I want, I always leave happy having one even!

Recently I got a dozen which comes with sauce and chutney. The green chutney sauce had a giant PUBIC hair when I got to the bottom of the container. I'll refrain from disparaging comments but you can imagine my disgust and outrage. Never again!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm very picky about Indian food - well cuz I'm Indian. Although I haven't tried everything on their menu but most of what I've had has been fresh and good. 

Their sweet selections is epic! If you're ever there - grab a pound of \"khoya barfi\" and thank me later"}
{"text":"I'm updating my previous review. This place is shit! We went there from Toronto and wanted our food as takeout. They took more than half an hour and guess what... the lady who gave us our package was putting her fingers in her ears and scratching her head and with the same hand she gave us our food. Can you imagine how unhygienic place is this!?!

Later on when we came home one of our Curry's box was broken and of course while eating we got plastic(the box is of plastic and of very low quality) so I took it out and still one of the plastic is in my throat and it's itching. Seriously if something happens to anyone you guys are gone!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Sweet Palace mainly for their butter chicken. I repeat, best butter chicken!  I actually got Sweet Palace to cater for a backyard party and they are amazing... definitely worth it. At the restaurant,  I order myself Chaat papari and Aloo tikki for appetizers and its always on point! I grab the excellent sheh kebobs and sizzling chicken tikka since I love my meat. For my main, obviously butterchicken with garlic naan.. Its too damn good. I usually never have room for dessert but when I do I grab the mango shake with gulab jaman (warm juicy sweet timbit) and rasmalai ( flat timbit in cream) thats the best description I can give ya'll lol. Just check out the butterchicken to make life easier ;)"}
{"text":"I've never seen a staff that was this devoted to ensuring that their customers had a good experience. From beginning to end, we had about 5 staff members ask if the food was good, if everything was to our liking, and if we needed anything else. It was fantastic. On top of that, the food is very VERY good. 

The highlight was the samosas, which were INCREDIBLY CRISPY veggie samosas covered in spicy chickpea curry. It was an explosion of flavour and textures. I could have just eaten that. But nope. We also had a (way too much, oops) naan, potato parantha, rice, lamb saag, chicken karahi and butter chicken (for the dairy folks). Everything was very good, though some of the folks weren't into the butter chicken too much. I loved the lamb saag. There were 6 of us and we took a ton of food home. The damage came out to about $15 per person, an absolute steal considering the quality and quantity.

This was a very delicious and busy spot, and I wouldn't hesitate to visit again next time I'm in Brampton."}
{"text":"This is my regular Indian spot and it's never disappointed. Food is consistently fantastic and service is not bad. Prices are great for the quality and portions provided. Restaurant is clean and modern. Always busy but rarely is there a wait."}
{"text":"Great! Authentic! Make sure you order ahead, only one cash register for some reason makes paying slow and normally a 10 min experience! Must get butter chicken although sometimes you only get 2 pieces of chicken!"}
{"text":"I had passed this place many times but never actually went in. This all changed last night, I was positively surprised to find a nice and clean sitting area. We were seated soon. The food is actually pretty good. You have an option of ordering a \"Thali\" which means a combo of 3 veg/non veg curries, a serving of rice, yogurt, garden salad and a sweet of your choice. Or you can order alakar style which also comes along with a serving of salad ( complementary). Their twist on salad with green spicy chutney and savoury condiments on it was a delight for my tongue. 
The food was well prepared and tasted fresh. Their nans ( flat bread) weren't as good as some other restaurants in the neighbourhood, specifically talking about \"rajdhani\" here which is located just couple of blocks away. The curries were pretty decent sized, well made. The pricing was pretty nominal for the taste. I will come back again. 
The only draw back of my experience was extremely and even more extremely loud music being played by the shop owner next door, but the doors of the restaurant were sound proof so thankfully we didn't have to go through listening to that insanely loud music while eating. 
Overall pretty good experience! Surely worth a visit"}
{"text":"With the sea of Indian restaurants (or wannabe Indian restaurants) in Brampton, I'm so glad to see one's getting it right.

Totally recommend the Butter Chicken, Saag, and also the Mushroom Curry if you want to try something a bit different.  Food is very well balanced.

My rating is only based on take out.  Ordering over the phone is simple and quick.

Decor is.... Well, it's there."}
{"text":"One of the best \"Canadian\" butter chicken I have ever had. Period. Good palak paneer, good non vegetarian items. I won't recommend it for dining in. Great place to take out. Prices are affordable too."}
{"text":"Sweets are good. Prices are okay, place is smelly,
But you should expect that from an Indian place! Service is okay as well, again something you'll expect at an Indian place!"}
{"text":"I visit this awesome place today.  It has one of the best vegetable Thali in GTA, food is spicy in taste in comparison to other restaurants which makes it even better. I was in a fix to give 5 star or 4 star. I settled for 5 star due to their awesome staff and specialy owner. They helped me in deciding what to eat as I was going there for the first time. Must go for veg Thali and Punjabi and Bengali methai."}
{"text":"Garbage establishment with poor customer. Came in to order two pounds of sweets and the horrible server refused to give us the sweets in the proper packaging. Thanks for nothing, waste of money."}
{"text":"This Toronto area (Brampton, actually) Indian food joint is solid.  

The samosas are good, the chicken tikka masala is on point, and the naan bread is outstanding.  

Visited here a week ago and liked it so much I was back a few days later for more."}
{"text":"Best Indian in the city. Top items on the menu: channa samosa, lamb curry, chicken tikka masala! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Thanks to my friend and family for taking my wife and I to this wonderful establishment. The food was just gorgeous whether it be savoury or sweet. Can't get enough of the naan!!!"}
{"text":"The veggies, butter chicken, excellent!
Take out was slower than I hoped, worth the wait.  I felt because the menu was a bit foreign, got me to order/buy more than I wanted.  Busy, lots of families."}
{"text":"Paneer Tikka!!!! One of the best I've ever had. I've said this before that this is one thing that tells if there is a Chef or cook in the kitchen. Service was great. We were looking for good food and good time. We got to experience both. Also, do try their falooda kulfi. It is really good. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"We were here in Brampton to visit a friend we haven't seen for ages. His whole family took us to Sweet Palace for lunch! The restaurant itself is really modern, clean and bright. It's a medium size establishment, front left side was the counter where all the sweet pastries and savoury snacks are. In front was also a hot table where you can see what you would like on your thali (plate). You tell the wait staff what you would like and they take your order, when it's ready they bring it over to your table. The other side is the seating area. So it's not a big place, and I heard it can become really busy and packed. 

I can't really remember all the names that was on my thali, so I will just describe them. Salad, Basmati Rice, Yoghurt Sauce, Curry Pea Paneer, Curry Chickpeas, Curry Honey Paneer, & Gulab Jamun. The whole thali was delicious! I couldn't finish it all, so I gave some to my husband. Along that we also had a sizzling plate of assorted meats, Tandoori Fish, Tikki Chicken, & Ground Chicken Kebabs! The meat dish was so moist and tender, it was awesome! They also had fresh naan made in-house, it was so good, nice crisp, super soft and spongy! Also tried the Made In-House Navajo Bread, also super yummy! There was also a Curry Dumpling & some pickled veggies & onions.

At the end I finished my meal off with a Masala Tea.
I was extremely overly content! Would highly recommend this place if you are in Brampton!

They also make Fresh Jalebi next door! Super crispy and delicious! Even when we brought it back home it was still crispy!!!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch one day after finding this place on yelp. It was a bit confusing since the register is right there when you walk in. We found that you can sit down with menus and order that way. The staff didnt seem to fully understand everything we were saying but enough to take our order.

The seats were really comfortable booths. They bring dishes out one at a time so i watched my wife eat before i got mine, if it wasn't for this my review would be a 5 star.

I ordered the Vegi Thali and my wife ordered the Samosa with Channa. It was all worth the wait as both dishes were amazing and full of flavour. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Good quality, good prices.  To be fair I was really hungry, but I think those were the best samosas I've had in my life.  I think it was the fresh-tasting mint and tamarind sauces which put them over the top.  The meat dishes and naan were pretty good too."}
{"text":"Delivery was a bit slow. But the quality of the food definitely compensated?! Ordered 1/2 tandoori chicken and it came on a sizzling plate (didn't expect) ... With all fresh onions on the top. Delicious! Mango shake was good too. Paneer was very good too. Worth a try and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I usually order saag as my go to indian dish. But I wanted it with shrimp, as I am a pescatarian, and they only had it with chicken and lamb. So I kindly asked the waiter if they could accommodate and make the dish with shrimp instead. He said sure, but we don't know how it would taste. I was amazed when they brought it and so thankful. My taste buds were overjoyed. Absolutely amazing! With my garlic Naan,  I was a happy camper. This place can get busy around dinner time, but you can opt for take out. They also offer all sorts of Indian sweets. The prices are inexpensive and I felt some of the dishes could be shared with 2 people. Love this place, not for the atmosphere but for the food and customer service."}
{"text":"Basically everything you would dream about in an Indian restaurant! The samosas were $1 for 3, and they were, as other readers have said, so so crispy outside and yet so fluffy inside. Their butter chicken curry that my friend had was delicious. I had a medium portion of the eggplant curry and it was very filling. The flavours are bountiful and there is so much that is jam-packed in their dishes, I LOOOOOOVE it.

Also, there are a lot of people and when you know its popping, youve gone to the right place"}
{"text":"I am really picky when it comes to Indian restaurants only because a lot of Indian restaurants tend to make the food quite oily and use a lot of artificial food colouring. Also, the food flavour is not usually authentic Indian. However, this is one of my favourite Indian restaurants. Delicious Indian food. They don't use artificial food colouring which is what I really liked. Strongly recommend this place if you are craving some authentic Indian food."}
{"text":"This place is very confusing. There are 2 locations separated by a store in between them. The one on the left is where they make jalebi fresh inside where you can watch them make it. The one on the right has a sit down restaurant with a variety of Punjabi food, snacks to go, and sweets. We went to both sides. 

The samosas are 3/$1 which is quite reasonable. Average priced, perhaps on the pricier side than what I am used to. They were not bad. The vegetarian thali was quite good for $7.99. Not a bad price either. They also give you raita which most thalis do not include. Everything I tried was really good. I really loved the gajar halva for dessert. Best I've had outside of the home. The naan was also very large and tasty. Nothing special. 

The jalebi was definitely the star of the visit. It was $4/lb. They were hot and sweet and crispy. Not overly large or soft, which I hate in a jalebi. The service was a little slow and you basically have to wait until orders before yours are filled before you even tell them how many pounds you want. It's confusing of you've never been before. 

The jalebi is why I will be coming back here several times. The food overall was not bad either. Service was mainly why I rated it 4/5 instead of 5/5."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've tried. Get the butter chicken it's AMAZING. I wanted to eat the samosas and make a  review but unfortunately they didn't have any. I said I would wait. The cashier said its 30 minutes I said that was fine. She laughed at my face and said \" really? You're going to wait 30 minutes ?\" I felt rather uncomfortable.

40 minutes passed and I asked if they were ready. She said no an extra 15 minutes. And the lady beside her said under her breath. \" we told you 30 minutes and we told you you couldn't wait that long\" little did she know I understand her language as I am of Asian decent 

Service could be better and in my opinion I bet they  even  make the samosas. But because the butte chicken and naan was so good I'll give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is my go to Indian restaurant. The food is always good and the prices are decent. There isn't much of an ordering system when times are busy so you just have to kind of make your way to the front. If i'm doing take out I usually call ahead to avoid a long wait. Only complaint is sometimes the samosas have been burnt on the edges or way too greasy."}
{"text":"i was looking for authentic spicy Indian food. I like that there's a spice rack table where you add the spice yourself. However, the variety is not much. I can't eat any Dairy, so. dishes already had the cream based sauce... so that was one of some dishes I couldn't bother to try out. For my first time being there I did need a little help for direction as to what and where elements were. The staff was friendly enough but slow when it came to ordering drinks... actually it took about 10min before a waiter came to the table. The entire restaurant is a buffet- a cool concept. I also didn't see much rice available. the restaurant was neat and clean, as were the restrooms. Alot of tables had people just keeping seats warm, just chatting/ gossiping for about an hour & didn't have a single thing to eat. It makes me wonder if hosting a gathering there would be beneficial or not as it appears they're willing to allow loiterers. Parking was ok. I'm not sure of public transportation. I'd go again but not as frequently as I was hoping for, as I heart spicy foods!"}
{"text":"I usually don't like butter chicken but the butter chicken here is really good. I've had their thali a few times and it's a good portion size and no complaints. I like the relaxed environment too."}
{"text":"As others have written, these are the BEST samosas in town. Fluffy yet crispy, not too spicy, generous potato-veg filling, and they give you two dipping sauces complimentary [mint and tamarind based] which is just alright - I prefer them with spicy mustard or a hot chutney. The pricing is really good, something like 3 samosas for a dollar which for the quality can't be beat anywhere in Brampton [or possibly the GTA]. There are a couple of different options for fresh fried pakoras which are ok but not as good as the samosas, although it's nice to have variety if you're looking to grab quick/delicious sides for a BBQ or dinner party. 

Of course they also have a great selection of traditional Indian sweets onsite, perfect for grab and go for any type of event. Their sister shop nearby offers fresh Jalebi by the pound which seems to be very popular on weekends and ethnic holidays. I know they have a decent lunch Thali special but personally I'm not really a fan of their curries as they are a bit bland and I prefer spicy Indian food. I mainly come for the samosas and sweets, but the restaurant is usually pretty busy round dinner time and on weekends."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Their butter chicken is AMAZING and they have a large variety of sweets"}
