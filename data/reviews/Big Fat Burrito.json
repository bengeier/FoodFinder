{"text":"I loved the decor but my burrito was underwhelming. The chicken was nice but the refried beans and rice were just boring. Nothing to help it stand apart from other burritos. My husband ordered the spicy and said that maybe it had once rubbed up against a jalapeno. No spice at all. I've had better burritos at Quesada!"}
{"text":"I have had the yam veggie burrito here several times and enjoyed it every time! The small size is filling enough and the large is recommended when you are famished!  The deep fried yam is a cool and tasty innovation!"}
{"text":"Von einem Local wurde mir dieser Platz empfohlen, die anscheinend besten Burritos der ganzen Stadt. Da ich in meinem Leben vorher noch nie ein Burrito gegessen habe, fehlt mir leider der Vergleich.    Der Laden liegt mittem im berühmten Kensington Market und sieht von aussen und innen ein wenig unscheinbar aus. Man kann allerdings die Schärfe der Burritos auf einer Skala von 1-5 auswählen. Die Burritos selbst sich sehr mächtig. Ich hatte einen Beef-Burrito den ich trotz riesigen Hunger nicht ganz geschafft habe.    Sehr zu empfehlen wenn man Hunger auf einen Burrito bekommt."}
{"text":"When the best thing you can say about a restaurant is that the people watching outside the window is good you know there is a problem.   I had the vegetarian burrito, which according to the menu should have included both guacamole and sour cream, although I would have challenged any forensic investigator to find either. When I asked for more I was told I could buy a side - and asking me to buy something that should have been included and was not? I did manage to find a small sprinkling of cheese in the burrito, but it took careful investigation to do that.  Back to the burrito. There was certainly rice in the and also lots of iceburg lettuce, and both in such quantities there was little room for anything else. I had asked for spicy, which appeared to mean that they let the burrito look at a garlic clove from a distance. Certainly no chili peppers had been harmed in the making of this burrito and no other spices either. Bland bland bland bland.  So, if you hate flavour, abhore spice and generally think things with taste or protein are bad, come on it. The pedestrian traffic out the window may help distract you from the sad lack-luster imposter of a burrito, but there is little else to recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place simply rules. For me, the three greatest burritos in town are the large pulled pork at BIG FAT BURRITO, in a very close second, the large halibut at BURRITO BOYS/BURRITO BANDITOS and the grilled shrimp at UTOPIA.  If there's any others in their league, I wanna know about them!"}
{"text":"I noticed big fat burrito about 2 weeks ago, but I was a little reluctant to go in because it almost looks like a hole in the wall kinda place. I did a little research yesterday and decided to give it a try for lunch today. Inside looks like a basic takeout place, there was a couple tables, and the place was clean.  I placed my order and went to the back and washed my hands. Order was ready in a couple of minutes. I decided to have the small chicken burrito and a ice tea (fountain drink) which was plenty for me for lunch (and probably dinner). I thoroughly enjoyed my food, I'm not really a fan of burritos in general but I will defiantly be frequenting this place often, because it was just so darn good :) .     Here is the menu & prices (which includes taxes)  BURRITOS  Veggie                      S $6  L $7.50 Yam                           S $7  L $8.50 Ground Beef            S $7  L $8.50 Breakfast                  S $7  L $8.50 Pulled Pork              S $7.50  L $9.50 Chicken                    S $7.50  L $9.50 Steak                         S $7.50  L $9.50  TOPPINGS (included)  Vegetarian Refried Beans  Mexican Rice Lettuce Tomato Cheese Salsa Guacamole (YES I said Guacamole, they don't charge to extra like every other place)  Green Pepper  Jalapenos Hot Sauce - your choice of 5  Sour Cream  Burrito Sauce (Garkicky Mayo)   HARD TACOS  Ground Beef $2.50 Veggie $2  DRINKS   Water $1 Fountain pop $1.50   There are more items on them menu, like side dishes and more drinks but I didn't write them down."}
{"text":"We always eat at Burrito Boys, but my friend suggested we be adventurous and try this place.  I ordered a steak burrito and the steak was rather dry and in the end not as good as Burrito Boys. It's true that it was less greasy than Burrito Boys, but the flavor was much better at BB at hot too (I hate cold or lukewarm food unless of course the dish is meant to be eaten cold or unheated). I was surprised that they did not offer halibut burritos either.  Now, my friend tried the yam burrito and as a vegetarian, she said that this was the best vegetarian burrito she has ever tasted."}
{"text":"I just moved to Toronto from the states, where I've had my fill of local joints, Chipotles, Moe's, and Qdobas. I was actually on the way to another restaurant when we passed Big Fat Burrito. I was very excited to try out another burrito joint, so in we went!  The atmosphere is really neat, the guy taking my order was really nice and I got my food quickly. When i got to eating it, the chicken was really overcooked and that kind of ruined the rest of it for me. Plenty of lettuce, though, and I enjoyed the crunch of raw green peppers instead of stir fried peppers, which I'm used to.  Also, for $9 (I was hungry, so I got the large), I feel like I could find a better burrito in this town. I'll probably go again to try a different meat, maybe a different variety of toppings, but the first time definitely wasn't what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"Typical non-California burrito...bland/supermarket flavors, wrong textures, lack of fresh ingredients, funky yellow cheese, etc. (i.e. \"Mexican\" like my Pennsylvania mother used to make). Only decent hot sauce and fairly pleasant fast-food atmosphere saved it from one star, though the surly service didn't help.  It's probably a fine burrito for most Torontonians, but not for those who have known better...and if you don't, you should know better."}
{"text":"Had the ground beef soft taco and it was fabulous!!  Corn tortillas are a big plus. Seriously best taco I've ever had."}
{"text":"Excellent burritos!  I ordered a large yam burrito.  It came out with lots of fresh vegetables, just the right seasoning, and not oversalted.  The sweet yam amount was just right."}
{"text":"It took me a couple of tries before I decided I liked Big Fat Burrito.  My mistake was that I asked for all the fixin's on a pulled pork burrito. Too juicy! Sauce dripping from everywhere, soppy, textureless, awful.  Chicken or ground beef and easy on the sauce is the way to go.  Lineups can get a little hairy at peak times"}
{"text":"you can never go wrong with the yam burrito, it will change your life. many extremely filling options for vegan and vegetarians. great price for a burrito that is bigger than your head, and the staff are always well trained and super chill. eat here! especially if you are from out of town. the wait times kinda double during warmer months because of the tourists, but the food is always worth the wait. make sure to request what level of sauce you want, from mild to medium or spicy."}
{"text":"We tried the chicken and the ground beef with all the fixins and 1 hot spice. Overall fantastic on both but the ground beef was more flavourful of the two. Very filling and not messy. Everything you want in a burrito. My one complaint is that the chicken burrito could have been warmer."}
{"text":"Oh, Big Fat Burrito... how I love you!  I love how you smell inside the shop.  I love the layout of the place.  I like how I can read NOW magazine and other weekly papers while I wait.  I love that you have two sizes of burritos.  I love that you are in my neighborhood when I come to visit town.  In fact, I want to go and get a burrito right now.  Just be forewarned:  If you're looking to drop $10 on a burrito and can of soda, then you've come to the right place.  It's not exactly cheap for a burrito, but then again they charge what the market will bear for a burrito.  (How has at least $8 become a socially acceptable price for a burrito, me wonders....?)  Anyway... the shells are wrapped up quite nicely and tight.  The outer skin is pressed ever so warmly.  The inside is made per your specifications.  I like to get---  half pork and half yam, with everything (including sour cream, essential) except no beans, and yes to hot sauce.  Food orgasm!  Also, I really like the letter magnets on the menu sign.  And I love that you get to take a number, just like at the butcher shop!  Sadly, no wet burritos available to my knowledge."}
{"text":"Really quick, cheap and what's more important, good & tasty! Probably the best burrito I ever had. Lots of options and toppings. A must if you like Mexican."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the sweet, tangy variant of burrito, which is why I immediately gravitate toward the yam/pulled pork combo at Big Fat.  Even after moving to Northern California, I've yet to find a burrito place that can pull this flavour off.    Yes, the lines can be long, and yes there's minimal indoor seating.  However, I'd say that walking around Kensington Market with burrito in hand is half of the experience anyway."}
{"text":"I love big fat burrito. SO much. My main criteria for a burrito is how filling, and how great the hot sauce is. big fat burrito offers a scale of 1-5 (1 being not spicy at all, 5 being for people like me who use hot sauce as ketchup).   the kensington location is conveniently located a block south of college in a corner location which is great for people watching. the staff are always friendly and they accept debit (rare in kensington market). the high-top seating and table are a bit flimsy but allow you to people-watch over the garage doors which surround the place.    the ONLY thing, keeping me from giving this place 5 stars, is the price. I lived in florida for a time and enjoyed big, fat burritos for 5$ from street vendors. Big Fat Burrito has great taste and the Large size is very filling, however you're looking at 11$ for a big one with a drink.the ground beef is my go-to filling. lots of 5 sauce!"}
{"text":"One of the only burrito places I like. I'm not huge on burritos mainly because I don't like overwhelming bean taste. They use a paste so its more to my taste. Also they allow for duo toppings. Many places don't allow for that anymore."}
{"text":"Fresh, quick and decently priced. Big Fat Burrito has come to  be one of my favourites in the city. I love the Yam Burrito so much I never deviate and still have yet to try their other ones or tacos.  Open late, this location is a godsend when you're in the mood for after gig food that isn't gross. The crowd of boozy folk can be a deterrent at times, but staff are fantastic and handle them well.  There are a couple of seats by the window at this location, but it's generally a take out joint. I like that their small is pretty substantial yet you're still able to walk home while eating it without it going everywhere. All in all, burrito yay!"}
{"text":"When it first opened in Kensington I was NOT into it at all. It seemed all big and chain restaurant like in the middle of boutique and community-driven Kensington Market. Also, there isn't really such thing as a vegetarian burrito here either, cause the refried beans are made in beef bouillon, as most refried beans are. BUT, when I was willing to get over it and see that the people who work there are 100% market, and that they have the right touch in the service, I mean, it's not like it's a McDonalds, then I started to love the convinience.  It's semi-covered with good people-watching sightlines, and a relatively well-oiled ordering system. They can take a while sometimes though, so it's not the grab and run time spot either. All in all, a great addition to the market."}
{"text":"I love Big Fat Burrito!! After an experience with the burrito place in the new Eaton Centre Urban Eatery (I can't recall the name), I really came to appreciate how good BFB is!! For the following reasons:  - BFB doesn't put (or maybe they do, and it's so miniscule or overpowered and I can't taste it) cilantro/corriander in thier burritos! I HATE that stuff, it overpowers everything that it's in with a taste that I can't even bare to smell let alone eat. Alot of the mexican places I've been to have this added as a traditional ingredient in thier food. The burrito place at the Urban Eatery asks if you'd like cilantro on your burrito. However, my server, when she was asking me, stuck her gloved hand in the bin and its some sticky stuff. So even though I said no... it was inevitable.  - They include guacamole in thier burritos without an extra charge! For some reason, everywhere I go, guacamole is like a prized commodity... costs aroudn 2$ extra to add it to something. I LOVE guac, so I usually dish out the cash. But at BFB it's included! And its delicious and appreciated!  - The burritos are large and filling, I always get a small chicken one, and I am certainly full! Not like the 10$ one I paid for at the Urban Eatery that was so tiny.  - The staff is always really friendly. I am posting about this location, in particular, because it's the one I've been to the most frequently as it's right beside my work. They're nice and friendly, always willing to chat, making jokes. Plus, my working at Sick Kids usually counts for something off the bill..!  So anyways... Try big fat burrito some time! I doubt you'll be disappointed! (PS you can choose the spicyness, you can choose what stuff you want inside your burrito). And besides this location, the one in Kensington is always amazing too!"}
{"text":"Worst burrito of life. I just got back (a block away, and I rode my bike) with a cold burrito, wrapped horizontally (so you get beans then rice then veggies with a touch of cheese at the bottom but never anything together) that is cold and dry. Asked for refried beans, got the other beans. Got giant chunks of unripe tomatoes. No sour cream or burrito sauce even though I asked for both and it's utterly flavourless. I can see the guacamole but it tastes like nothing. So little cheese it's insulting.   Leaving work super late and just needed to eat something and this is so gross I'm eating raw carrots from my fridge instead of the tasty burrito I was hoping for.   On top of that, two staff members were in the shop when I walked in, no customers. A guy took my order, than two orders behind me and the other girl just walked to the back while he took my order. So I waited for ages while he took everyone's orders and then started making burrito's solo. Lame."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Big Fat Burrito several times over the years, but last nights large veggie burrito was the last straw, never again. I've had yam, chicken, and pulled pork too. It's not that there was too much sauce, it's not that it was too small, it's not even that there was some unacceptable ingredients imbalance: it was just not as delicious as a Burrito can be. It's a fools errand to sit down on Yelp and try to diagnose the problem, burritos are complex, and I am not qualified to know how they should fix it. Just save yourself the trouble and get Burrito Bandidos down the street (which aren't perfect either)."}
{"text":"The burritos here are alright, they don't taste as \"dirty\" as some other burrito places (does that make sense? It makes sense to me haha, i think it's the bean sauce)  I like how the prices already include tax and they are cheaper than Chipotle. Service here was alright, the people who work here are nice and do make small talk while your waiting. I usually come at around 8-9pm and it's almost always dead which kinda makes it feel weird.. but that's ok!  So overall, pretty normal place, nothing to snazzy about it but it's yummy, satisfying and cheap-ish =)"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  I had the yam burrito, but the yam itself was cold, like it had been added straight from the fridge at the last minute, while the rest of the burrito was lukewarm.  With all the great burrito places nearby, I don't think I'll ever go back to this one."}
{"text":"I may not be as experienced as some other burrito aficionados, but I loved all 3 times I have been to this place. They are big, messy and delicious. I love the atmosphere at the place, and there always seems to be a long line, which to me is a sign of future stomach fulfillment.   I think it's great that the kitchen is so open, and you can see exactly what the staff do. Some other places feel a little more closed off to the customers, and I have the image in my head of burritos being dirty. Well not here, they seem to treat each burrito with the utmost care.  The result.... delicious big fat burritos!"}
{"text":"Walked by and tried it. Had the small pulled pork burrito and paid about $10 with a drink. It was really good, but I found it a bit pricy. Might go back though when i am in the area ... Overall good middle of the road burrito place."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best burritos in all of toronto, amazingly priced, well proportioned and with just the right amount of hot sauce and jalapeños. The pulled pork burrito is mouth watering, slightly sweet, tender and yet very spicy if you want. I fully recommend this restaurant and hope it stays open for a very long time."}
{"text":"Pulled pork burrito with yams = BEST THING I EVER ATE!"}
{"text":"Tidbits from a conversation I had whilst gorging a chicken burrito sums up the gut's experience I think.  \"If you could choose between sex and eating this burrito, which would you choose?  I can say that, right now, I'd rather eat this burrito.\"  Chew.  Think.  Swallow.  Nod.  \"Burrito.\"  Rapture.  Seriously.  Every time I think I'm not in the mood for a burrito from Big Fat (chicken, medium hot with all the fixins), I'm dead wrong.  Yall know what I'm talking about.  When your order is called, and that hot little thing is in your hands, thou shalt hold it more covetously than a kitten that grants wishes.  Well maybe not.  cuz than I'd wish for more burritos."}
{"text":"Not as good as Burrito Boyz.  Their Burritos are not really worth the trip. I'd stick with Burrito boyz as the Burritos here are pretty bland and not worth a 2nd try.  However, the service is pretty friendly."}
{"text":"It was truly a big fat burrito. The meat tasted very sloppy joeish, but the rice and beans which I had inside were great. They cooked the outside which made it crispy. Overall it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I have to say I was pretty disappointed with Big Fat Burrito.    I'll agree that the service was friendly and quick enough, but the burrito itself wasn't much to get excited about.  Contents were OK I suppose, but the salsa had a strange ketchupy/BBQ flavour that didn't go with anything else and it put the rest of the burrito off.  None of the flavours seemed to mix together, and the chicken was a little dry too.  This was the first time I remember getting a \"small\" and thinking that it was actually small, too.  If it was tasty, I would have been sad that I didn't get large.  I didn't try the yam option, because I usually try a new place with a standard chicken burrito to even the playing field.  this might be a good one for vegetarians, but I'd recommend skipping the salsa.  I've heard that they make a good breakfast burrito, which I might try, but I won't be back for lunch when there are so many better, and bigger, burritos in the city."}
{"text":"Anyday is a good day to go to Big Fat Burrito...and Today was On of them :) Ever since I got the YAM and Chicken...I haven't gotten another kind here. No where else I have gone has has this AWESOME combination of choices. Turns out this is the first store of 3, I believe...opening 6 years ago. The staff are always great and the OPEN SIDE WINDOW is a great feature...especially in the Summer to feel as if you are in some resort eating your FAT burrito :P I made a Video of this GEM and it will be posted soon :)"}
{"text":"This is one of the places that I would walk by once a week and always say, \"I'm gonna eat there when I'm back in this neighbourhood,\" but on my next visit I would always pick a different place.  Well, I finally went to Big Fat Burrito, and it wasn't worth the wait. As the star rating suggests, it was A-OK.  I had a small ground beef burrito with everything on it, and it tasted like the average burritos that I have eaten at other restaurants. I would argue that I make a better burrito at home.  The ordering process was very quick and it took only eight minutes to get my food.  The burrito was not messy and it held together pretty good.  But next time I'll try a different place."}
{"text":"Had the chicken burrito bowl. Not much in terms of flavour... seemed to taste mostly just the refried beans. Would be nice if they had some cilantro, maybe in a pico de gallo or something"}
{"text":"Pulled Pork.... burrito?  I had to try it... and a day later I'm craving another.  It's a lot closer to a California-style burrito than most places in Toronto I've tried, less \"trying to do a burrito-pita fusion\" or whatever the \"Toronto-style\" burrito is trying for."}
{"text":"These guys make an amazing yam burrito.  I'm not vegetarian but I get it almost every time because it's so good.  Their other burritos are good too and if you're vehemently against something that, goodness no, doesn't have meat then by all means choose them.  Otherwise try the amazing yam burrito.  I've been to two of their locations, Kensington and Dundas near the bus terminal, and the food has been great every time.  The portions are big; the small burrito is usually enough to fill me up."}
{"text":"Went to Kensington Market after Buskerfest in hopes of going to another restaurant, but most were closed so I ended up going here.   What to Expect -It's at the corner of a semi busy intersection with an open layout and no windows so it is perfect for just chilling and eating. -You order first, then you are given a number and then called up to get your food. -Friendly staff with eclectic customers, well it is Kensington Market so don't be surprised!  What I Ate -I wasn't too hungry and it was my first time so I opted for the $5 petite ground beef burrito with sour cream, cheese and salsa.  -It was NOT petite, the burrito was really heavy and did make me fat after...LOL -There was barely any salsa or sour cream in my burrito :/  -Burrito was tightly packed and the tortilla was good quality and didn't unravel while in the process of eating.  It's a great place if you're broke and hungry. I think other places have better burritos."}
{"text":"This place makes THE BEST burritos I have ever had. It is the place to stop in Kensington market if you are hungry."}
{"text":"This burrito place is average. After visiting California, nothing will ever beat the ones I tried there But, for Toronto, they all taste pretty similar to me.   The atmosphere of this restaurant gives a home-kind of feel to it, since it's pretty much like a sun room. In the summer, they usually have all the windows open, which sort of creates an outdoor patio feeling. I just love sitting here and enjoying my burrito while I watch the streets of Kensington Market.   The workers never rush you when you order (and I'm a very indecisive person), which is always a thing I look out for....even when there was a growing line behind me.  This place is nothing to die for, since it's like all the other burrito place out there. But, if you have time to relax and eat (and if you are around the area), this is where you should be!"}
{"text":"This was probably the least satisfying burrito I've ever purchased.  I don't think I finished it and I got a small yam burrito bowl.  The bowl just lacked flavour overall.  Super stingy on the sauce (sour cream and the burrito sauce), tasteless beans. Hardly any sweet potatoes and they also did not taste like anything.  The only reason I'm rating it 2 stars (as opposed to 1) is that the burrito was uber cheap so even though I tossed it out, I only lost out on 6 dollars."}
{"text":"Delightful yumminess is all I can say and after a night of drinking even better"}
{"text":"I read the yelp reviews before I headed to Big Fat Burrito, knowing that it is not the best place for burritos. But I said, hey! how bad could it be? The burrito imo was pretty bad for a store that specializes in burritos. I ordered the veggie which was $6. It comes with everything on the board and you can tell the cashier if you want to omit anything, I suggest getting rid of the lettuce and the tomatoes, and here's why. The lettuce got all soggy in my burrito because it was grilled and the tomatoes were not fresh at all! The rest of the ingredients did not scream fresh to me either, the salsa was nothing special, the beans were bland and the cheese tasted like generic brand cheese. However, I may add that the guacamole was decent but there are much better guac options at other burrito joints! I would have been much more satisfied grabbing a slice of pizza!   The pluses of this joint are that it is quite charming and authentic looking. The place was filled to the brim and people were standing around waiting for their burritos. The experience with the staff was good as well, and the service was well organized for being so crowded and in such a closeted space. I love the Kensington Market neighborhood but I was sadly disappointed with this joint!   Maybe the meat options are better?"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito ever. Five bucks and done to perfection. Kudos to the tattooed guy who rocks out to Sade as he does his stuff."}
{"text":"Not great. For reference: Chipotle is much better and cheaper. That being said it's  edible mexican food and if I was to find my self hungry in kensington market, I'd consider it at least."}
{"text":"This is probably my least favourite burrito chain in the city.  And within this chain, this is my least favourite location.   So that's a double-whammy.  Something about this place = just a little too much of one thing or the other. Too much salt (chicken). Too much sweet (pulled pork). Too much fluorescent (lighting).  At least at the Kensington and Annex locations you at least feel kind of cool eating there (though honestly, it's worth the extra trek out to nearby Burrito Bandidos if you're in the Annex), but this Bay/Dundas location feels like any other bland chain joint.  That being said, it 's worth popping in here if you happen to be craving a glass-bottled Coke."}
{"text":"I had found this place a few years ago and thought it was awesome. Went again tonight and had a huge steak burrito. I thought it was much fresher and much tastier than burrito boyz. I find the meat at burrito boyz is starting to be a little plain. This had some nice flavour.  oh and the girl behind the counter had the same ironic hipster glasses from clearlycontacts.ca. I bet she payed 20 dollars for them too."}
{"text":"Probably been here north of 30 times. Breakfast burrito with everything, hot-spicy with burrito sauce is my go to hangover cure. The location is really cool looking and especially cool during the summer. The service is quick and typically pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Large pulled pork after a night of drinking is a very good thing. Unfortunately I tried the same burrito sober and it was average.  I do like the customizable options that the store offers, as well as a variety of hot sauce options that are pretty good. Sauce 2 and 4 are both stellar.   The staff are friendly and laid back, especially when dealing with the crowd of young people strolling in from lee's palace next door.   Good place for a quick bite and a large is more than enough to satisfy even large appetites."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times to grab a quick taco, and they're amazing. The tacos are inexpensive, tasty, and big! Sure is a lot better than taco bell. At $2.50 each, the beef taco costs less than a hotdog from a street vendor, and it's much more satisfying."}
{"text":"This is the first place I have found that actually rivals, or maybe even surpasses, Burrito Boyz. I thoroughly enjoyed my yam burrito."}
{"text":"Great place if your after something quick and filling, the decor is indicative of Kensington market. We shared a large pulled pork burrito with all the toppings and spicy sauce (no 4) and in the world of burritos it was good, not the best but most certainly not the worst .The staff were pretty chilled and the place has a relaxed atmosphere, so overall a good experience."}
{"text":"got a chicklen burrito (which i made my choice since it they told me it was grill and had a bbq taste) got  big burrito at first i was happy with the size since it was hell expensive but not as big as other places for the same money. when i ate it i found out it was to much of the fillers and only the salsa was contributing to taste the rest of the things were rather bland and i had many bites with out chicken the chicken didnt taste anything like a grill or bbq meat. the sauce the chicken was in was not tasty at all :( drink selection was rather poor compare to other burrito places.  burrito tasted like something you would put together fast with left overs, nothing making me want to come back."}
{"text":"I could've sworn I've reviewed this place and I just wanted to add an update...oh well, here goes...  Ok, I had the chicken burrito here awhile back and found it very 3-starish. However, a few weeks ago I wanted a burrito, was on my way in this general direction anyway, so I decided to stop in for the yam version, which had been meaning to try anyway. I'm so glad that I did! The yam was perfect for this understated burrito. I'd go back for this, and only this, in the future!"}
{"text":"quick, filling and tasty. If you are around Kensington market, you should try this place."}
{"text":"I love their burrito's. I actually go to this one when I'm in the area and prefer it over their Kensington Market location. The guy's that work here are so much more chill and friendly. They always stuff my burrito with a ton of meat. The only semi-bad experience I've had here was when they gave me a number 4 hotsauce instead of number 3 but it was all good. They gave me a free drink, and I really didn't care. I ended up liking it actually."}
{"text":"This place has big juicy fat burrito's which I can't get enough of. I actually prefer the Bay and Dundas location over this one because of atmosphere and service, but stop by here more often because there is parking. There is always this one chubby girl who is rude to me cause I don't say \"spicy\" and just ask for jalapenos. Really? Do you have some Starbucks-esque lingo going on here. Other than that, place is much better than other burrito joints in the city."}
{"text":"Cheap burrito. Not particularly memorable, and I wouldn't seek it out again, but it was good and I might stop there again."}
{"text":"Good, but not great. I have had better and I have also had worse. I had the small veggie burrito and it wasn't bad. I was craving a burrito and this place hit the spot. I really like the way they grilled the burrito -- just right.   Would I go back? Sure, why not.  Would it be my first choice? Probably not, but it's not a bad option either."}
{"text":"It's come to my attention that I review a lot of burrito places. I've even reviewed another location of Big Fat Burrito; I can't help myself! I'm a fan. This was oh so disappointing though.   Got a steak burrito and the meat was tough. The \"burrito sauce\" was salty, runny and coated everything. It was like there was a cold vs. hot battle going on in there with the two refusing to mix leaving me with stagnant bites. When eating a burrito each bite should be a bit different in a good way! The Boyfriend liked his pulled pork burrito but made a mess of himself with that burrito sauce he didn't ask for. Where's the sour cream?   All of this and the room was cold! In winter, getting food is my escape, a nice little break from the bitterness of winter. Not so much. Something I did like was the old school coke bottles. It just tastes better from a glass bottle."}
{"text":"I had a good time with my burrito, but not a GREAT time. If this were a romantic relationship, I would ask it out on a second date for sure but with some small reservations.   The service was friendly, really friendly! Like to the point of faking me out several times before actually handing me my burrito. But honestly, they explained what was going down and asked all the right questions with a smile.   But something got lost in translation because I asked for everything and everything was not there. There was no spiciness! No jalapeños or heat in the sauces whatsoever. A bit less sauce might also be appreciated- there was a lot of dippin' and a droppin'.   All and all was it tasty? Yes. And will I return? Yes!  The ingredients were fresh and a steak burrito is delicious while I still have plenty more options to try."}
{"text":"So I asked them for a veggie burger and they didn't even flinch.  As well as being accustomed to all types of customers in various altered states, they make a mean  burrito.  Likeaphenomena and I split a large.  While you're there pick up a Boylan's Rootbeer, the perfect mix of spice and creaminess."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for a burrito,  The portions are large but I found that the fillers were bland and not at their freshest. The flavor of the ingredient didn't punch like other places. I wouldn't avoid this place but if i wouldn't come back if I had a favorite burrito place to go."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, very disappointing particularly in comparison to Burrito Boyz, it's not even a comparison !   The burrito here was dry, too much beans and not enough meat, and didn't feel like fresh ingredients. Not impressive food, going to stick to Burrito Boyz & Chipotle"}
{"text":"Big Fat Burrito put a big smile on my face! =)  A busy spot for lunch, limited seating and lineups as expected. The service was friendly and prompt.  I'm not sure I'd consider a burrito a healthier option... But it sure is tasty. The small is the perfect size and filling!  I had the popular yam/chicken with all the toppings. I found my burrito quite saucy!  And the sweetness from the yam made an average burrito super yummy.  I'd come here again for yamburrito goodness! =)"}
{"text":"This place is interesting because it has a yam burrito!  Which just means mashed up sweet potato in your burrito, so I suggest if you're not veggie, you combine it with meat, like chicken, which actually tasted pretty good.  Other than that unusual twist, it was also the healthiest tasting burrito I've ever had.  I think because it wasn't smothered in sauce, but it was still pretty good - just not as good as burrito boyz.  I wish they had at least a fish burrito on their menu too.  The decor inside is cheap, but the service is fast and the price was reasonable, at least compared to all the other burrito chains that have sprung up recently."}
{"text":"I passed by this place with a craving for burritos so I dropped in and was pleasantly surprised.   I had a large burrito which was super filling and delicious.   I'm dying to try out the sweet potato burrito which sounds delicious.   It's definitely a nice change from Chipotle but also a bit costly.    Adding a combo to a large burrito can set u back over 12 bucks just for one person."}
{"text":"I used to visit this place every so often for a big burrito. But today I noticed that overall prices went up. Also they seem to use a lot less meat than before and more rice and other fillers. This time I actually didn't have enough money to get 2 large burritos, so I had to get 2 \"small\" burritos (the only other size) for $17. Well, one burrito didn't fill me at all, and I still felt hungry, which is disappointing for a $8.50 burrito. The service was good, and the burrito itself still tasted pretty good. I just wish they had it bigger. I'd say you need over $10 to get a \"large\" burrito for a filling meal."}
{"text":"I ordered a large burrito and I wasn't sure whether to eat it or call my friends and have a baby shower."}
{"text":"While on vacation we came to Kensington Market....we were hungry and decided to check this place out. Service was fast and friendly. Food was mediocre at best. I had the steak tacos...nothing to write home about. But still decent."}
{"text":"We went to Big Fat Burrito on a warm summer day, so we were able to take advantage of seats right by the large open windows.  The entire ordering process was a little intimidating, but we were able to figure it out after a couple of minutes.  I was afraid the 'big fat' burrito would be too much food for me, but it turned out to be the perfect portion.  The burrito wasn't overly greasy and the ingredients seemed fresh.  The restaurant is conveniently located on a busy corner, so it's great for people watching."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday. It's just a short walk from my workplace. The service is always quick. I ordered a burrito bowl with half chicken and half sweet potato. The sweet potato is awesome. I like that they roast it with the skin on. The bowls are filled to the top. The best part is they don't charge for guacamole. Definitely my favourite spot to grab lunch and get some fresh air during my lunch break."}
{"text":"Veggie or Steak burrito with some fizzing drink makes for a pleasant and fulfilling stay here.  A small veggie burrito \"with extra guac\", better than any fast food intake (in size and nutrients) is about $6.    The indoor patio has open windows in the warmer seasons and is right on the street with the Market dwellers and pedestrian posers.  The first reviewer said this is expensive! - Obviously they did not notice the MF! KM5T."}
{"text":"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!   My usual go-to is the steak burrito. I don't know why, I don't normally order beef but one day I had a craving and now I'm hooked. It is by the most filling fast food, and if you consider one burrito at lunch might mean you don't need dinner, $8 is a pretty good deal! Add in a Boylan's grape soda for the full experience.   I've had other burritos around town but nothing beats this place."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this place. From the moment I found it, I have been here tons of times.  Though it is not the cheapest way to dine, it certainly fulfills an appetite. I never learn my lesson and keep ordering the large burrito when I perfectly know that a regular one is more than enough.   The layout is interesting and can be difficult to find a seat during peak hours but overall, this place is awesome!  Thanks Big Fat Burrito for existing!"}
{"text":"Most medicore burrito for the most ridiculous price. $12 for a burrito isn't that high, it's mid-high but the burritos here are really weak. They barely had cheese int hem and the meat is non-existant. It's really disappointing. They mostly fill your burrito with rice and beans. Do you like lots of rice and beans? Place is a perfect match for you.  So yeah I wouldn't go back here. Ever. Burrito Boyz is so much more worth it at almost all of their locations. Burrito Boyz started charging extra for guac but they actually give you guac. This location claimed they added guac but I never even once tasted it."}
{"text":"Like that they have yam as an option. The highest 'spice' level was a little disappointingly mild; next time I'll request one of the extra hot sauces they have on display. Good size burrito and well-stuffed."}
{"text":"Just okay. For 5$, I got the smaller burrito. The meat was bland but in combination with the rice and other toppings, it was fine.   I was more disappointed that there wasn't a soft-shell tortilla option for tacos and that the cook making the tacos was miserable. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt; Maybe she was having a bad day but when I happily asked for some extra hot sauce (like the sign on the counter tells customers to do), she huffed and puffed and was obviously disgruntled.   I don't know if I'd go back. Nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"DH and I love their burritos. They really do load up the burritos and doesn't feel like they skimp on the meat or fill the burrito up with rice. They are always cheerful and make you feel valued as a customer. Love this place - its our go-to for Tex-Mex cravings :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the burritos here! For $7 you can get a small, and it's so filling! I never leave this place without feeling satisfied!   Service is good, takes about 5-10mins depending on how busy it is. This is def, a good spot to check out if you are just wandering around and want something filling and affordable. Ideally, it's a good place to bring one or two friends with, but not really a group.. since there are only a limit of seats.   I always enjoy the veggie burrito!"}
{"text":"On first appearances I'll admit I wanted to run away from this spot. It looked sketchy, the staff looked kinda tough and the people walking in and out were kinda scary. But that was just my suburban jitters acting up again as I quickly acclimated to the fact that I was in Kensington Market and I was here on a Burrito mission and heck that's just how they roll in this part of the city.  No longer judging this book by its cover I entered Big Fat Burrito with a Big FAT..... appetite. What a pleasant surprise! The staff was super cool and efficient to booth operating this place like a Big Fat well oiled machine. Order up! Number given, wait, Calling number ## and voila presto change-o your choice of small, or large burrito was made fresh, hot and to taste.   This day I opted of the chicken (on the recommendation of two staff members.  \"what do you recommend?\" I asked.  \"The chicken...hands down!\".  \"Really?\" \"Oh ya...you can't go wrong\" - all this said with a stone face...  Well friends that is a stone cold recommendation if I have ever heard one.  Verdict = SCORE!  This big fat burrito of choice (a small...because I need to watch my girlish yelp figure, was packed with a big fat assortment of toppings and a big fat unmistakable taste.   One of my most favorite points about this spots burritos is...no leaks!! yes that's right like a pampers or a really inaccurate maxi pad commercial these burritos had NO LEAKS!! The filling and juices stayed inside and not ONE drip was spilled on my paper...unheard of in the burrito world.  A Big Fat apology to you guys for the initial prejudice, you have quality goods and a heart of gold. Thanks for filling my big fat (wait a second.....) thanks for filling my tummy with your burrito goodness :)"}
{"text":"Well, all good things and that, right?  Management has changed their pricing structure after the Ont. min wage hike, going from ~$12 for a large, to $15, then $14, and removed/reduced the tomatoes and green pepper in place of much cheaper corn.  I'm all about supporting local small businesses, but not when it makes it seem like they're profiting off of a situation like this. If they wanna show me their books and can actually justify this kind of pricing increase, I'm all for revising my opinions, but as it sits I'm stuck drawing back, unfortunately.  Sorry guys, I won't be able to frequent you as much as I've enjoyed in the past decade :("}
{"text":"We were disappointed in our burritos after revisiting the popular spot specializing in large extra value portions with a nice choice of toppings. The atmosphere reminded me of a greasy food stand at the Ex with no one in charge. After looking over the menu of toppings and wondering what was a good choice, they said, 'what do you NOT want on it?' Not a very appetizing prospect. The burrito was a mushy mess and the yams were stringy and not pleasant. There are better places to eat in the Market, like recently opened Doner Mania."}
{"text":"My opinion of the food at this location goes along with my review of the Kensington Market location. I just wanted to make a special note about the staff at this takeaway-only BFB. I've dropped in here late night to grab a post-drink burrito and each one of the staff there is on fire, dealing with the multitude of drunken orders with grace and ease. It's a small place, and gets crowded with college kids full of too much beer, yet BFB still do okay.   Thanks for the late night snack and the smiles guys!  [Side note: I know it's awesome that the Annex now has a BFB, but I do look at it wistfully and wish it had some seating like the market location. Ah well!]"}
{"text":"If you like your burritos big, fat and now, you've come to the right place. Despite their constant stream of customers, the staff at Big Fat Burrito still churn out quality product in pretty good time - although the lineup can get a little crazy, especially if all the seating is full too.  I love the ease with which I can order a veggie burrito made vegan - no hassle, no fuss, I get my dairy-free burrito with ease. Chock full of beans and rice and a nice level of spice, it's simple and filling and one of the best no-frills burritos in town. All that and I can wash it down with a Boylans pop? Heaven!  What I am puzzling about is how I haven't yet managed to try the yam burrito! Next time, BFB.. next time."}
{"text":"Bland and boring.  Ordered the large chicken burrito and regretted it almost immediately. They were out of black beans... I would think this is pretty basic for a Mexican spot? No spices or really any flavour to speak of. Pass."}
{"text":"The vegan burrito I use to eat here is HUGE super good and tasty. One of my favourite places in Kensington Market!"}
{"text":"I've originally tried the kensington market location, loved the food but found the restaurant too small and kinda dirty (though some ppl enjoy that rustic feel). Personally I really enjoy the big fat burrito at this location. It is convenient to get to, being near yonge and dundas, and is very roomy and clean. My go-to burrito is the pulled pork burrito. This is perhaps the only burrito place I've been to where the burrito was wrapped well enough that I didn't have sauce falling out of the bottom. Overall one of my fave hangout places when I'm in the area, and I've recommended it to many people."}
{"text":"I'm done. The service here is horrendous. Rude is putting it mildly. They got a key location in a tourist district so I guess they can afford to be rude. With minimum wage going up and people will have less money to eat out, this place is going to suffer."}
{"text":"With Kensington Market being my backyard and today being Pedestrian Sunday, I conveniently strolled through my backyard to find people on stilts, a leprechaun making animal balloons, puppets and breakdancers and oh.. Big Fat Burrito!   It was a happening place today but that didn't seem to discourage the people working there. They are like a well oiled machine.. I placed my order (ground beef, no tomatoes, medium spice with burrito sauce AND sour cream) and waited for the magic to happen... and boy did it ever.. First of all.. it seemed like a short time to wait for something that was made fresh on the spot. Everyone who works there is so in sync. My order was taken and my burrito was made and in my hand within 10 minutes... That to me is solid service...  The Burrito itself... probably the best I've ever had. I have a feeling they will be seeing alot more of me."}
{"text":"Love the walls and the graffitii style wall art all over outside - the food was okay.. We ordered an extra spicy burrito and it barely even had a kick.  ..Meh"}
{"text":"After my visit to the burroto boyz, I had to check if I'd forgotten burritos were bland. Big Fat Burrito is a reassuring reminder this is not the case. Burritos can be flavourful. And I've been to three different BFB locations that all featured friendly staff, good food and no nauseous after effects (like some boyz do).  The selection of toppings is thorough, several options for upping the spicy level, an exceptionally good veggie option (sweet potato) to go along with the usual burrito choices and some interesting soft drink options in the fridge. This location could use some more seating space but its perfect for grabbing something satisfying on the way home."}
{"text":"Love the burritos here, had better but nothing else is available in Kensington market that satisfies my burrito cravings."}
{"text":"Best Burrito I and my friend have ever had. Not flashy, there is limited seating, usually a line up...  BUT, I understand why there is a lineup.  I enjoyed the beef with all but green peppers...  Here is all goes on except what you DO NOT WANT.  Enjoy, I will again soon!"}
{"text":"The yam burrito is worth trying and good if you're a veg.  This place was very busy when I was there on \"pedestrian Sunday\", so expect a slight wait for food.  I'd go back!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the vegetarian burrito but I find this place depends on who is assembling the burrito how much guoc and sour cream you get. I always leave here full, and I enjoy how attractive the staff are.  Yes I am that shallow. extra star for hotties."}
{"text":"The burrito was both big and fat, but what they don't tell you is that it is awful! My main complaint about my burrito was the sauce - some sort of sweet BBQ sauce, which is about the least Mexican thing I can think of. After checking in here, I was awarded the \"Mexi-Can\" badge, but really it should be taken back. The BBQ does not mesh at all with the flavour of the burrito. I didn't even eat the whole thing it was so bad, which is no small feat considering the large costs $10.75.  Chipotle is only 1/2 a block away. You have no reason to go here. In fact, I think I'll go to Chipotle tomorrow to wash the taste of bad burrito out of my mouth."}
{"text":"It may not be the most consistent burrito joint in town but I live across the street so when the burrito cravings kick in I will always come here.   Sometimes the burritos are great and leave you feeling awesome. Sometimes they are average and you take a bite and get a mouthful of just lettuce, or just beans, or just meat. This should never happen with a burrito! Everythings meant to be mixed man! If i take a bite and get just lettuce I'm not gonna feel awesome afterwards.   In saying that, sometimes I order the burrito bowl (the burrito without the tortilla, essentially making it a burrito salad) and I actually kinda love it. You have to do a bit of mixing as they like to compartmentalise the toppings but once you do, oh man its good!  The meat here is always tasty and the service is okay and as long as I remain across the street I will be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Thank God.  I just got home from Big Fat Burrito, and I was thinking I hadn't wrote a review.  Whew!  I am pleased that this is just an update, not a spanking newbie.  I finished my 3.5 hour NPPA HR exam at UofT today, and I was starved.  Big Fat Burrito's ground beef with all the fixins is what I craved.  I love the marriage of flavours and texture that Big Fat Burrito's bundles of joy offer.  I am also a fan of the seared burrito's as well.  It just holds all the bits together, adds that extra bit of hot temperature and makes them portable.  Nothing worse than wearing your burrito.  If you haven't been to Big Fat Burrito yet, give them a try - you will love em!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! This place has really good tasting burritos. The food is fantastic.   The lady at the front was very friendly and helpful. We didn't know where to go and what to do and she helped us and gave suggestions.   I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing people rave about Big Fat Burrito for years.  I'm not too into Kensington Market to begin with, but I found Big Fat Burrito underwhelming.  I had a chicken burrito and it was good, but I think people over-hyped it.  There was nothing wrong with it but I wasn't having the best food time of my life.  I found them bland and not really flavourful.  Very unfortunate!"}
{"text":"What happened to the fully loaded burritos I used to tell people about? Hardly fat or big anymore. It's actually quite disappointing and annoying recommending this place since they used to be good. The staff are also incompetent on several occasions we didn't even ask for jalapeños and low and behold burritos is jam packed with them. The only thing this place has going for it is Grape Boylans since they are so scarce around the city. Burrito?, walk to queen street west, save your tummy and money!"}
{"text":"An insult to burritos anywhere. Ordered by phone for pick up and none of the specifics of the order were fulfilled. Even with the wrong order, (black instead of pinto, no veggies when specifically asked for extra veggies, white instead of whole wheat, the spice levels for all orders were wrong) the burrito wasn't wrapped properly, the meat lacked any spice or flavour. Never again!"}
{"text":"A forearm of burito with high quality ingredients between $10- $15. I can simply not complain. Go there at least once."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of burrito's in my day from several different burrito places. I really only expect two things from a burrito. The ingredients I ask for and for it to be cooked properly.   I went to Big Fat Burrito and ordered a veggie burrito (what I get at every burrito place) when I got my burrito fairly quickly I was excited, only to realize when I took a bite that it wasn't cooked through. The sides were completely cold and the cheese wasn't melted at all. I would have gladly waited longer if they would cooked it properly.   I walked up to the cash (there was no line at the time) and kindly asked the girl if she could heat it up a bit more, because it was cold and the cheese wasn't melted. She quickly snapped - \"did you already take a bite\"? I wanted to say \"Of course I did, how else would I know it's not cooked properly?\", but I just said \"yes I did\". Then she said. \"No, we can't. next time you have to order it well done if you want it cooked like that.\"  WELL DONE? Are you kidding me? I have to specially order my burrito to be well done so that it's warm and the cheese is melted? No - I won't order it well done next time and I wont come back.   Like seriously? Because I bit into it they can't heat it up on some tin foil or something? It's not rocket science. I've re-heated burrito's in my oven before. Like, you actually can't figure it out? I would have even been happy with it being put in the microwave at this point. I'm not even looking for proper customer service where they actually apologize and re-make it for you.   I just chucked it in the garbage and left. I wish I could give zero stars.  FAIL."}
{"text":"BFB is definitely worth the price of admission.  Grab the fully loaded pulled pork and experience the ultimate in Swine decadence.  The burritos are MASSIVE and they can quite literally feed the average carnivore for two meals.  If you are extra hungry you will inevitably gnaw through it in one go, but don't plan on operating any heavy machinery.  BFB is conveniently located within stumbling distance of several Annex hot spots and is almost unparallelled when it comes to late night eating debauchery."}
{"text":"Came here because Burrito Boyz was closed (which I wanted to try). A lot of different burrito flavours to choose from. I tried the chicken and pulled pork burrito bowls. It was alright, kind of disappointing because I'm a huge fan of burrito bowls with all the fixin's but it lacked flavour  (blandish taste) and I wish they put more guacamole and sour cream in it. :( The prices are okay, but I prefer Chipotle or Wilbur Mexicana (my all time fav!) over this place. Stop by if you're in the area but I wouldn't recommend making the trip here if it's not convenient."}
{"text":"Big Fat Burrito isn't misleading anyone. It's just that... It's a burrito, it's big and it's likely to make you feel fat after you inhale one.  This corner hugging, Mexicana styled burrito joint has been a staple to the Kennsignton community for years. Whether you're a local, a weekend dweller or a tourist just passing through, you're sure to hit that hunger pang in the sweet spot, with one of these loaded torpedo's.   Big Fat Burrito has many options on their board: Pork, Chicken, Beef, Yam, Veggie or Steak. Best part about it...you can combine the yam with any of them. I usually get the chicken and yam. Surprisingly the chicken is moist. They also load it with all of the good toppings and you have a choice of sour cream or their special burrito sauce. Go for the special sauce.  BFB, can be hit and miss. Some days the flavors are out of this world, and other days, it's just a sloppy bland mess.   It's not the best burrito in the city, but if you're starving and in the neighbourhood, it's worth the indigestion."}
{"text":"No,no,NO!...this is not a \"steak burrito\"!... it is an overpriced wrap with too much beans,rice and guacamole and some braised beef in it!.... And the tacos are just simply boring!.... Never again!"}
{"text":"While  hanging out with two of my guy friends, I complained that I was hungry but for something different. One friend suggested Big Fat Burrito but warned me, \"you won't be able to finish just one\". My other friend and I looked at each other, and without speaking, we both knew: we were up to the challenge!  The board with the coloured magnet letters made me smile when I first walked in. I got \"little kid\" giddy. Then the smell of the different meats sizzling on the grill hit me and made my mouth water. Now, as far as ingredients go, I'm not fussy. But I am big on sauces. I like them spicy but with flavour. So we each ordered a burrito--mine was chicken, my friend chose beef--and sat down at the tables to eat. My point of is mostly for the seating atmosphere. There's not much selection for dining in.  Their burritos are great! I loved the ingredients. The veggies were fresh and the rice was delicious. I loved that the chicken was seasoned and not just plain grilled chicken. But the sauce is what sold me. It was perfect for me, hot and tasty. I always know the food is good when my friend and I barely talk to each other. My friend loved it so much that he bought another one \"for the road\" even before he had finished the one he originally ordered.  I'm not sure how this place would weather in the fall/winter months because it really is like eating inside of a tent. But I would definitely get a burrito to go and savour the flavour at home.  As for the challenge? I missed it by the last 7 bites...but the challenger never needed to know ;)"}
{"text":"Have you ever desired poop between dried up nasty old tortilla shells... And paying 7 bucks for it? If so, look no further... Big Fat Burrito will serve you a big fat steaming pile of old crap on a tortilla for you...   By far the most disgusting, cold, awful, dirty taco/burrito in a city saturated with great burrito joints.  Don't waste your time, cash or years left alive.   The only positive... There's a great alley to throw this crap up afterwards right behind it."}
{"text":"um. gross.  i'm going to be fair and preface this with the fact that i live in san diego, like 40 minutes from the mexican border, so i have eaten my fair share of burritos. but that also means i know a good burrito when i eat one, and big fat burritos are, well...terrible. my friends that live in toronto are all in love with it, so when i visited it was the first place they wanted to take me. i have an open mind and love burritos, so i agreed. (and before you think i'm an american snobby snob, please note my dual citizenship and love of all things canadian. except, well, these burritos).   i ordered the veggie burrito, spicy. they told me i'd need a fork. a fork? why on earth would i need a fork with a burrito? i found out later it's cause the sauce they put in it makes the bottom of the rubbery tortilla fall apart. the beans taste worse than canned, non-fat Rosarita refried beans, really bland. The spice, it turns out, was supposed to come from jalapenos which were raw and definitely not spicy at all. The worst surprise were the chunks of raw green bell peppers. Those should never be in a burrito! And if they are, they should be sauteed with onions so they're soft and flavorful. Not the case here. The contents of a burrito are supposed to mingle inside the tortilla, each bite a delicious mixture of rice, meat/veggies, salsa, sour cream, guacamole...everything was separate chunks inside, if that makes sense, so one bite you get gross bland rice and some sauce, the next bite gross raw peppers and some sauce....it's just not right. And what is up with what looked like panini grill marks on my burrito?? The only place that that makes sense at is the grilled stuffed burrito at Taco Bell, and if that's where the inspiration for this came from, that's just sad.   i dont mean to sound like a burrito snob at all, and i understand that palates vary regionally and i'm spoiled with wonderful mexican food everywhere around me, but yeah...would definitely never care to eat here again. also, whoever labeled this place as \"tex-mex\" has never, ever, EVER had tex-mex.   some positives--the staff was really nice, and the restaurant set up was kinda cool."}
{"text":"Love this place! I go to UofT and it's my go to place when I have a burrito craving. The staff is really nice and the prices are pretty average for a burrito in the city now a days.  I always get the pulled pork, the meat is always super tender and juicy. My only criticism is that the spice level is lacking. The first time I ordered the spicy it tasted mild to me, so I always ask for extra jalapeños now. While they may not be life changing burritos they're consistently good and they induce crazy burrito cravings!"}
{"text":"I have been a few times, the burritos were good, they have a great selection too (I love the breakfast burrito, and the squash burrito) Went yesterday though, ordered a burrito, and the cook made it really well, but when I asked for a bag, the cook just pointed at the bags. He didn't know that my right hand doesn't work, but would it have been so hard to put my burrito in a bag himself when I asked? Bad customer service, I wont be back, there are so many other places to get food in the market."}
{"text":"The staff need to get their act together, getting a burrito from this place is like a blind date.You never know what to expect, either you will get a horrible burrito and snide service. Or a great burrito and tolerable service."}
{"text":"A few nights ago, I decided to check out the places app on my phone and stumbled upon bfb! I love burritos and thought let's give it a chance! The staff was so friendly and the burritos delicious. I got the #1 sauce but I'd recommend a different number sauce for others who want a really spicy burrito, ,mine wasn't too hot at all, but still good. I got the small and was stuffed! I loved how all the veggies in my burrito were in huge chunks, crunchy and fresh! One thing about them though, kinda hard to find! Although the building is painted in this wacky mural, there is one little sign that says big fat burrito on it! So just look for the crazy building face with crazy colors! Overall great and can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent burrito! I had the Veggie Breakfast burrito and t was honestly the BEST burrito I've had, and I'm a pretty big burrito person. The tortilla was crispy and well made, good proportions and the sauce was delicious and very spicy! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First time here and it did not disappoint! Ordered the small pulled pork without rice, with jalapeños and #2 hot sauce and the level of heat was perfect. Tender, tasty pork, fresh vegetables and crispy shell. The small is huge! Options are available for whole wheat tortilla and also burrito in a bowl. Will try out the yam one next time.   TIP: $1 off your order if you are a hospital employee and show your badge. Friendly service and clean seating area to enjoy your food.  Update : discount for sick kids employees only! So sad..."}
{"text":"Came here because El Trompo was full and the sky was threatening rain, so we wanted to eat indoors. After eating at Big Fat Burrito, I would have rather gotten drenched eating on the porch at El Trompo than have another burrito here. My Big Fat steak Burrito didn't offer much by way of interesting flavor (very bland and yet exceedingly salty at the same time) or texture (too mushy, not enough lettuce/vegetation to give any contrast against the gummy beans and rice). It makes my heart cry to say this, but I had a better burrito at Chipotle. Sigh."}
{"text":"I love big fat burrito. Not this one though! I've been in several big fat burrito  locations and always had a good burrito and good experience but this time around, not sure why, my wife and I got real sick from the burrito we had. 2 separate burritos, one veggie and one pulled pork yet both of us had a violent reaction to them and spent the next couple of days going to the bathroom a dozen times."}
{"text":"If you like Burritos and you are in the area you should check this Big Fat Burrito branch as it never disappointed me. Always consistent, always good. The atmosphere is great and the only drawback is the parking. it's in the kensington market so parking is always hard to come by. Worth the hassle though."}
{"text":"A cool, kinda dingy (in a good way) spot to grab big, fat, tasty burritos that aren't the best in the world, but definitely hit the spot.  I'm particularly fond of the pulled pork burrito.  Yum!  There are so many excellent places to eat in Kensington Market, however, that BFB might soon be lost to me in favour of the cult of the new.  Agave here I come!"}
{"text":"Big fat burrito is my fave burrito place in Toronto but this one wasn't as good as I've had at other locations!! Too much rice :(. Maybe it was just the day though. I'll still be going back."}
{"text":"Yes best burrito in town and this location is my fave. The staff are friendly and the food is great, what more could you ask for??"}
{"text":"The first few times I tired this place, I thought it was the Best Burrito in town. Since I've been there a few more times, I've found their burritos inconsistent. I'll still eat here. They are, A-OK. But consistency is key."}
{"text":"M' first time eating a burrito, m'thinks. Wasn't too bad.   The place was casual so it's great for just a drop-by, no pressure eat and go kinda thing :D   Tried the small yam burrito with medium hot sauce one Friday afternoon--it was enough to have me satisfied (and not bloated). Hmm, and the wait wasn't too long (5-10minutes ish?).  Couple bites in m' burrito started falling apart on me and the dripping commenced -.- My buddy wasn't any better off so just a precaution to y'alls: get a tray or something with your burrito for less of a mess on you/the table.  Maybe I'll come back to try their other burritos."}
{"text":"burritos are not as good as burrito boyz but still pretty decent. cute location, but very expensive. i love that they let you pick your hot sauce brand."}
{"text":"Not the worst, bust also far from the best.   BFB is in a great location, in a great neighbourhood. Two things let it down, the staff and the construction of the burritos.   On my last visit the guy with tattoos behind the counter was too busy chatting up the chick with the tattoos in front of the counter to take any orders from the people without tattoos waiting in line.   Dude, you're not a rock musician, you're working in a burrito shack, so stop the attitude and get me food, ok? Because, you know, when my blood sugar drops, I get gnarly, tattoo or no tattoo.   The burritos, when they arrived, fell to pieces on bite two. Which was a shame, because the ingredients were not bad at all, just sloppily assembled.   For the money there's better food available on the market. Try El Trompo for example. Fresh tacos and super friendly service, no attitude of any kind."}
{"text":"Big Fat Burrito serves a big, fat burrito!   The service is always friendly and cheerful. I seems like the staff really loves the product. I order the veggie burrito ($7), which is fresh, full of veggies and always hits the spot. I think something is missing for the ZING! factor. I have never craved a Big Fat Burrito, but I have had cravings for some of their competition. I won't name them, but you can figure it out.  I'll be back, I know it.   Lessons Learned: 1. This Zing! factor is probably the guac. 2. There is a fine line between not enough rice and the motherload. 3. Burritos make a perfect lunch - no mess and no need for cutlery. 4. Free guac makes me really happy.  5. Getting my lunch without being made to feel like cattle comes as a shock."}
{"text":"I have to agree it's expensive. $7 for the small burrito and not very fat and $9 for the large and very fat one. Unfortunately I wasn't too hungry so I settled for the small and while very tasty, I kept thinking it would've been worth it to double the size for $2 more.  The place is interesting and they let you choose your brand of hot sauce. Choice of vegi, steak, chicken, ground beef and others. Only thing that disappointed me was that while the outside of the burrito was warm, most of the toppings inside were cold! It would've been muccchh better if everything was piping hot but maybe that's just the way I like my burrito."}
{"text":"Obviously came here at like 2.30AM after Clinton's. It was pretty busy, the service is fast and the burrito was fresh. There was way too much bean in my chicken burrito for my liking, I already have trouble coming to terms with the fact that a burrito is essentially carbs inside carbs...  Pretty average, I got mild and it wasn't spicy at all for me so definitely will go for half and half next time!  Very small place but looks clean and the servers were nice...even though I was slurring. Sorry \"chicken\" probably sounded like \"sheeekaaahhh\""}
{"text":"Do you like burritos? They sell them here.  They are pretty tasty and reasonably priced.  Nothing mind blowing."}
{"text":"Food is God. God is great. Therefore it stands to reason that Food is Great. That, of course becomes completely untrue if you are eating at Big Fat Lazy Greedy Burrito.  Why all the negative energy dude? ( I know, I agree).  Well, when you start off with an overpriced small burrito at $7.25, you start to get irked. When you bite into that burrito and it cracks in two, you get blindsided. And when you take the one of four bites it's gonna take to put this experience to rest and it's filled with dry, cold chicken, you are down right offended and hence NEGATIVE.   I've never done this, the review update that takes a business down another notch.   But I think one has to watch out for taking things for granted. Just because you are in a hot neighbourhood doesn't mean that you are entitled to rip off your customers. I'm sure the food they use is of the cheapest  quality. If it was anything more upscale or organic, they'd say so to draw in business.  its time for an upgrade. boo hiss hiss boo."}
{"text":"I've been lunching here consistently for several months and I have never been disappointed. The variety of sauces is both savory and spicy, the veg fresh and it's consistent. The ground beef is my favorite and the staff is always friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite before going to Hot Docs Cinema.   Yum!  Had a veggie burrito Level 4 spicy.  WOW.  They take their spice seriously.  The burrito was good.  So good I came back the next night.  Would definitely try the Yam if I am ever back here!"}
{"text":"A quite acceptable burrito. Prices on the menu INCLUDE tax so don't be put off if it seems their burritos run a few cents higher than, say, Chipotle. All 'n' all I was quite satisfied with the price, portion, and taste."}
{"text":"I've search long and hard (well maybe not that hard..) to find Toronto's best burrito spot, and i think this is it! Even if you take away the friendly order taker who calls me \"hon\", the fast and very proficient service, and the fact they throw in a free side of sour cream if you ask, their burritos would still be super yummy! A combination of Marinated meat, perfect mix of toppings that include fresh tomatoes, lettuce, rice, guac, green peppers and their own personal tasty burrito sauce combine to make the best stuffed, toasted, and perfectly hydrated (not too dry or gooy) burrito money can buy!"}
{"text":"Love it! You can customize your burrito and they have a lot of really great options!!! THe burritos are warm, but not soggy, and the ingredients taste and feel fresh! The service here is amazing and the staff are always happy to give us advice on whats good and whats something we might like to try. =) Definitely a big thumbs up!!  And the seating is ample with great lighting, and the bathroom has always been clean on ever visit. They also have a great drinks variety in their refrigerator if you're not into pop/ ice tea.   Always friendly, always good. =) Even on those rainy days!"}
{"text":"Burritos taste great and the service is fast and efficient. The staff were very friendly. I'm not much of a burrito person, but I actually quite enjoyed their burritos! They aren't as far as I thought they would be, but as a person who doesn't eat much anyway, that's okay.   The place is clean and I love the paintings and decor on the outside of the building. But there really needs to be more seating and their washroom was horrible designed. The toilet paper is placed right in front of the toilet....so when you sit, your knees are hitting the toilet paper dispenser.... Rather uncomfortable design when the washroom is so large and you could hang the toilet paper on the side instead..."}
{"text":"I'm a big burrito fan and always like to try different places.  I have been meaning to try Big Fat Burrito for awhile now.  I stopped by last night and tried the small steak burrito.  I had everything on it except jalapenos, hot sauce and guacamole.  The burrito was the perfect size, but a bit pricey.  I was not impressed with the taste of the burrito at all.  It was quite bland and the steak was pretty dry.  The staff seemed like they were trying to rush everyone out of there, which is probably why the burrito wasn't pressed enough, leaving it kind of soggy.  That was my first and last experience at Big Fat Burrito."}
{"text":"Meh. I love a good burrito, and nothing about the pork burrito I tried here blew me away. Sadly, this is why reading Yelp reviews is supposed to exist... I failed to see in advance the lovely advice of trying the yams. However, it was just not flavourful enough. Filling, yes. But it really fell short in the tasty department. I will go back for the yams, but I don't have high hopes."}
{"text":"I used to loooove this place, but my last two experiences were underwhelming. The burrito fillings are not very interesting, and both the burritos we ordered were lukewarm. Service was extremely indifferent.   Good if you're in a hurry and want something filling! I was full for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Big Fat Burrito. And I liked it. I just didn't love it, and I probably wouldn't go back. (Though I do love that they have a \"petite\" size for smaller appetites.   I got a small veggie, with everything but green peppers and it was alright, but it just wasn't great. I know you're supposed to like the little guys more than the chains, but I'd have rather had Chipotle, honestly. There was supposed to be sour cream, cheese, and guacamole and while I saw a tiny (I really mean tiny) bit of cheese and guacamole, I saw and tasted no sour cream, which reading other reviews seems pretty common. My burrito traveled about 20 min home, so I expected it wouldn't be HOT, but maybe luke warm, but it was flat out cold when I got home. So that was a little weird.   On the upside, it's a cool location, the servers were super friendly, and the service was fast."}
{"text":"Don't not notice the student special! I missed a free drink :'(  Delicious veggie burrito though!"}
{"text":"It's a good burrito. I like the yam burrito. I won't go ahead and say it's the best burrito I've ever eaten, but it sure hits the spot."}
{"text":"Big Fat Burrito is pretty damn good. The small burrito and pop combo for lunch (10$ tax included) is very good. The burritos feature generous toppings and come in beef, chicken and pork on the special.  You can also opt for a veggie, veggie vegan, yam, breakfast or steak burrito.  The restaurant opens to the outside on warm days. The staff are generally friendly. Nice also that they have ample seating for guests. The same can't be said for other area KM spots."}
{"text":"There's nothing quite so sad as a middle-of-the-road burrito. It's not bad enough to be offensive, nor is it good enough to elicit enthusiasm. It's just...there.  I was walking through Kensington when it occurred to me that it'd been years since I'd sampled Big Fat Burrito's wares, so I popped in and ordered a small steak burrito (which comes packed with refried beans, Mexican rice, lettuce, tomato, cheese, salsa, guacamole, green pepper, and burrito sauce/sour cream).  It's a pretty long wait for the final product, but then again, I did show up right at lunch. I finally got the burrito about 15 minutes after ordering it and enthusiastically took my first bite. This tastes mostly liked canned refried beans, I thought to myself. Subsequent bites fared slightly better, as the rest of the ingredients began to make themselves known. But the problem is that nothing here really stands out as an above-average component.  The \"steak\" is dry and tough, the guacamole is so sparingly applied that it might as well not be in there, the salsa tastes like a generic store-bought brand, and the burrito sauce resembles a zestier version of Thousand Island dressing. (It doesn't help that the burrito was absolutely soaked with the latter.)  It seems unlikely that Big Fat Burrito would still be around were there any burrito competition in Kensington, and I really can't see myself ever going back - especially given the massive number of other, better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Huge burritos but I think the veg ones kinda lack taste. The beef is good though."}
{"text":"Very glad they have a ramp from Stopgap.ca to make the space relatively wheelchair accessible.  If they're able to modify a cooler case near the counter, which takes up enough space that a motorized chair can't pass by to fully come up to the counter, it will be able to directly accommodate all customers.   Food was also very decent, service friendly.  Thanks for working on accessibility, guys!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey compared to other burrito places in Toronto. But the worst of it is that they use pickled jalepenos. That's not right."}
{"text":"I remember that I used to love this place. It's OK, I guess, but not quite as good as I remember it being.   The location itself has maybe 3 or 4 tables and bar seating around the wall facing outward. The tables are a little slanted and wobbly, but then again, the actual location is (look at the ground when you walk in). Funny that the location has been like this for at least the 10 years I've gone to it and not only have the floor not been fixed but neither have the tables =)   Alas, people go into a restaurant for food, not the floor, so how was the food?  It's interesting that the burritos actually are not that big and not that fat. I think it's OK size wise...not that different from any other burrito place though. The filling is OK as well. I would have preferred more lettuce and tomato/salsa..but it was very loaded on beans and rice. I also would've appreciated more heat as well."}
{"text":"This used to be better than an average burrito place a long time ago. Now not so much. When I have a great burrito I can always taste everything but nothing should be overpowering. Ok maybe the meat can be highlighted a bit. That's a good burrito. I got the pulled pork here and I tasted the salsa more than any other ingredient in it. It might have needed more time on the grill too. The pulled pork was on the drier side. I think there are better food options in the area."}
{"text":"Was in the area waiting for my sister's Greyhound bus to arrive. I forgot my lunch at home today and thought that I could be strong enough to skip lunch - needless to say, it was an EPIC FAIL. I was starving, but didn't want to get something from the bus terminal so I walked around and found Big Fat Burrito.  In spite of all the hustle and bustle outside, the inside is very quiet. There is a small eating area so you can have your food here. I ordered the chicken burrito; for a small it cost me 8 something dollars. The burrito was good; is it worth 8 dollars? Not for me.  Good for: quick bite, lunch"}
{"text":"Love it, simple, fast, healthy, cheap, friendly, hippie, multicultural, cool, lovely, interesting, delicious, fresh, colourful, eclectic, unique yet simple!"}
{"text":"I looove the veggie and yam burritos (I'm a vegetarian). They are really filling and as cheap as it gets."}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles, I've certainly had my fair share of burritos. Kensington Market has a very good variety of Latin American food, probably the best in the downtown core. Compared to the other hole in the wall taquerias further down the street, Big Fat Burrito is pretty much a Kensington Chipotle. Their prices were fairly similar (8.50 for a small, 12/11ish for a large) but I would stay the portions are a little smaller.  Got a medium-spicy pulled pork burrito with all of the toppings (and the burrito sauce and sour cream, which comes without charge but are listed separately on the toppings menu). A friend got a chicken and pulled pork mix - the chicken and pulled pork burritos are the same price, so you can ask for half of each meat with no extra charge.   The burrito came tightly wrapped and grilled so there was a nice crunch on the flour tortilla. It was kind of ehhh in terms of taste: it wasn't bad, and I definitely enjoyed myself, but it was not a stellar burrito. They did something I don't really like though - the tortilla was too big for the fillings (or maybe there just wasn't enough fillings in the tortilla) but there was an annoying, dense core of rolled tortilla in the middle of the burrito where the extra tortilla ended up. Either add more fillings to fill up the tortilla, or use smaller tortillas! The medium had a good kick to it.  Solid burrito, but I think I would still prefer to support the smaller locations down Augusta! They're a little more grungy and probably a lot dirtier, but those tacos are quite worth it."}
{"text":"I probably go here more than is really appropriate.  The flavours aren't mind blowing, but they are reliable and the staff are usually pretty friendly."}
{"text":"I've only made one visit here and I wasn't particularly impressed with what I got for the price.  My vegetable burrito was not particularly tasty and I felt that the option of choosing your hot sauce was great, but may have been a gimmick to cover up the fact that the food was bland.  The service is fast and the wait is reasonable.   I would agree with Dardana's review that I strongly prefer Chipotle and would only come here if looking for a dependable option for lunch in the area."}
{"text":"This place was my first real burrito experience. After moving to Toronto my husband had been stopping here for lunch on several occasions and kept speaking highly of his burritos. Having never really tried a burrito before (yes I know, sad) we made our way over to Kensington Market one Saturday afternoon and I had my first ever Big Fat Burrito! And that it was! I obviously opted for the large, because if I'm going to try a burrito for the first time then I figure I may as well go big or go home. While it was a lot to stomach I managed to finish the whole thing!   I got the pulled pork burrito! Pulled pork has become my go-to burrito choice. Of course I got everything on it. I made it spicy. It was delicious. I keep going back to the Kensington location because I like it so much. While there are many other burrito locations around town I think I just have a special place in my heart for this place because it was my first!   I find the prices here to be pretty average compared to the competition around town. The staff is generally quite friendly. My only complaint is that because of the location (in a garage) it is very hard to regulate the temperature. On cold days its super cold in there and likewise on hot days its pretty steamy!  Oh, and I'm a pretty big fan of the magnetic letters used on their menu board. Classy? No. But it sure is unique (I think...)!"}
{"text":"burrito brothers is what fast food would be like in a perfect world."}
{"text":"I was craving a burrito so Gord and I had a late lunch today at Big Fat Burrito since we were in Kensington Market.  It was a busy spot but was quiet when we stopped in and we were able to get a table.  Gord and I both got large chicken burritos ... I got mine without lettuce and guacamole.  It was big and heavy ... and delicious!  The fella who took our order was friendly.  I'd stop in again if I was in the Market and craving a burrito."}
{"text":"Kensington Market burrito institution Big Fat Burrito recently opened a new outpost out front of Lee's Palace. It's an absolutely brilliant location that will, I'm sure, bring in tons of business for Big Fat Burrito and it has also improved the look of Lee's Palace. Personally, I wish this was a Burrito Boyz/Bandidos, but I settle for any decent burrito place to break up the monotony of sushi and falafel places on Bloor.  The space is small and it's more of a takeout joint, although they do have a counter with 3 seats. Prices are high, but on par with other burrito places in the city.  I had the large Yam Burrito ($8.50), which was a decent size and left me full but not stuffed. The yam is a really nice touch and, I believe, unique to Big Fat Burrito. The other toppings are all decent, but I feel the burritos are a little bland. They just don't have the same great flavour as Burrito Boyz.  I'd like to see an improvement in rolling technique because my burrito started leaking half way through. Also, I asked for my burrito spicy and didn't taste any heat at all.  A great addition of an above average burrito joint to Bloor. I'd like to see Big Fat Burrito up their game a little, though, and really break out of the pack of average burritos purveyors."}
{"text":"Big Fat Burrito makes one of the better burritos I've had in the city. I've never been blown away by a burrito here but they're consistently good.  I usually go for a large yam burrito which, at $8.50, is a little expensive. Despite the name of the place, the burritos here aren't massive; I'm comfortably full but not stuffed after eating one. On my most recent visit I was also impressed by how well my burrito stayed together.  The yam is delicious and really makes these burritos stand out. The other toppings (rice, beans, guac, veg, etc.) are above average by Toronto burrito standards but just seemed to be missing a little something. Perhaps a better burrito sauce or salsa would help with this. Also, I ordered mine spicy and didn't taste any heat.  Four stars for the delicious yam and I'd up it to 5 if they perfected the rest of the toppings.  Pro Tip: On my most recent visit my friend ordered a pulled pork AND yam burrito. I didn't know you could combine fillings like this but it sounded like an amazing combo. With 7 possible fillings this means there are a total of 7 + 7*6 = 49 possible unique burritos. So get out there are start experimenting."}
{"text":"The only redeeming quality about this place was the cashier was nice and sweet and entirely accommodating. The guy who actually made the burrito was a dingus and basically threw my burrito on the tray, mumbled my number and ran away like a dork. Where's the love pal? Where is the customer service? I don't want to eat a burrito that was haphazardly thrown away like poor orphan by a line cook that doesn't care about the food he makes. This whole charade was a precursor to how much my burrito FUCKING SUCKED ASS.  As for their name sake...THEY ARE BIG FAT LIARS. Your burritos are gross and you should all be ashamed of yourselves.  This review is more of a comparative study between all the Mexican eats on offer around Kensington. The burritos here are neither big, nor fat, nor all that tasty. I got a large chicken, and it was sad AND little. Not much chicken in there or anything else for that matter. So really, all I got was a mediocre \"large\" burrito (that was actually a rip off) for $11.25. I can walk down the street to Mexican Salsa's and get a friggin 2 pound authentic burrito for around 7 bucks. If you feel like taking a longer trip to Burrito Boyz (The actual promised land), well you god damn should, because their burritos are also BIGGER, FATTER, GOOIER, and generally also a better bang for your buck since you get a proper large chicken for 8 bucks (go ahead, get that can of coke too, you deserve it).   Big Fat Burritos are also dry as hell. Where the hell is my burrito sauce? Where did you put the sour cream? I know I asked for it, I know you said I could get both, so I did. COME ON GUYS. GET WITH THE PROGRAM. Everything ever needs sauce. Lots of sauce. Saucy Sauce Saucerton.  Lastly and most depressingly, my burrito sorely lacked the umami flavor profile. I bit into my burrito and I was just like \"WHAT IN THE HECK IS THIS, WHY IS MY BURRITO SWEET. IF I WANTED A SWEET BURRITO I WOULD HAVE ORDERED A FRIKKIN YAM ONE.\" When I think of a perfect burrito, I think of a complex flavour profile; a little tanginess from lime or lemons in the gauc, some nicely salted and seasoned protein, a touch of bitterness from the cilantro and herbs, and a hint of sweetness from corn. But the burritos at big fat are just a anti-climactic one note SWEET. There is none of that magical savouriness you'd expect from the perfect food (burritos, durr).  From all the amazing Mexican on offer a hop and a skip away, please seriously consider giving Big Fat Burrito a BIG FAT PASS."}
{"text":"When ever I crave the goodness of a burrito, Big Fat is always my first choice.  You see, i like chicken burritos and this is the ONLY place that doesn't use \"mystery\" ground-chicken bits in their food.  Big Fat always uses nice chunks of all-white meat.  The blend and mixture of ingredients is always perfect, and they do not over-use rice as a filler (I'm looking at you Z-Teca burritos!)  They have various sizes, but you will never need anything bigger than a small burrito.  I swear it weighs 1 to 2lbs, and should fill even the hungriest of bellies.    I can't speak for the Dundas St location, but the Kensington one (the original spot) is pretty amazing.  Cheap, filling, nutritious eats.  Need I say more?  *Bonus Points for frequent Ryan Gosling sightings in this eatery, if you're into that sort of thing :P"}
{"text":"Decent food and a very casual atmosphere. Clean area and good staff. No complaints but nothing to really differentiate it from the plethora of burrito places populating the core."}
{"text":"Terrible veg burrito! I couldn't even finish it I was so displeased.  The sweet potato burrito is very bland and not worth the time it took to wait for it or the money it cost to buy it. Service was indifferent and made me feel like I was a burden.  I think Burrito Boys is also terrible, but would still recommend it over Big Fat Burrito. If you're looking for a good veg burrito, Fresh has just added a good one to it's menu, or just walk around the corner and hit up the veg burrito gods at Hot Beans."}
{"text":"Two words: Yam burrito. Or three, depending on whether they say 'sweet potato' or 'yam.' Whatever it is, get it."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest burrito connoisseur, but my dinner date for the early evening was and he says that albeit big and fat, that BFB's burritos are \"allllllright\". I opted for tacos (one \"vegetarian\" filled with rice and beans and the other seasoned ground beef) and was satisfied.   The street-facing seats are prime people watching spots and great for those warm (or just sunny winter) days when Kensington is abuzz with energy. I found it a little chilly on the windy night that we ate there, but the Ramones playing overhead kept my leg tapping."}
{"text":"Affordable and Kensington Market-esque branch. It may not be the most formal-looking restaurant but it is definitely unique in the way it looks. I got their Large Ground Beef Burrito and it tasted pretty good. The proportion is bigger than I imagined. Service had absolutely no problems and was pretty fast. Great place to just chill with a friend. Nice bonus that it's facing beautiful graffiti art."}
{"text":"Prett good buritos. Fairly large and satisfying. They are friendly. And they get your burito out pretty quick."}
{"text":"Average.   That word resonated inside my head while I was biting through my beef burrito. A burrito that had a few bites of glory, but not enough to stop such an ugly word from popping up in my head.   The size of the burrito (I ordered a large) was quite big so the name of the restaurant certainly fits. The toppings like the rice, guacamole and the veggies tasted alright but nothing popped in my mouth. The beef did taste really good. It was not greasy at all. My biggest disappointment was the poor construction of the burrito. I am not a messy eater but after a few bites my burrito was already breaking up. It would have been better to put it in a bowl, eat it with a spoon and call it something else. A good burrito is a burrito that holds it shape and this did not do that.   To be honest, I don't consider myself a burrito connoisseur since I have only eaten at a few burrito joints in Toronto. Yet, it doesn't help that Burrito Boyz and New York Subway were a couple of places I did go to before my stomach brought me to Big Fat Burrito."}
{"text":"My colleague recommended this place so I tried the small ground beef burrito today and it was really good.  I ordered the small size with everything but rice and medium spicy and I finished every last bite.  I like spicy food so I would order it hot next time.  It was very filling.  The large was huge!  It could easily feed two people.  I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love burritos.   Big Fat Burrito sells burritos.   So there's a pretty low bar for a decent review here.   They happen to be generally tasty burritos; well stuffed when ordered with everything (which is really the only way to eat a burrito), and toasted to a golden crisp.   Amazing what a good toasting does to a burrito-melting the cheese and melding the ingredients together into a harmonious whole.   Somehow, even the toppings you'd think should be kept cool-the sour cream, the lettuce, the avocado...all benefit from the application of griddled heat.   I usually alternate between the ground beef and pulled pork options; the latter not too sweet, the former pleasantly downmarket and damn filling.   Competing chains trumpet shredded brisket or cubed steak. They're great, too, but sometimes there's just something to be said for good ol' ground round. It makes for a tasty working man's burrito. Bonus, unlike the steaky options, no gross fatty or cartilaginous bits.   Big Fat Burrito used to have other locations-one near the Atrium on Bay, close to the Eaton Centre...and the other a kiosk by Lee's Palace. Sadly, both locations are lost to history.   The world needs more burritos."}
{"text":"Order: Veggie Burrito  Atmoshphere: Clean and empty.  Verdict: Man, this burrito didn't have a good balance. There are so many toppings listed, but what I tasted was mostly the mushy beans. I'd like it if it had more lettuce, peppers and other toppings, but the chipotle sauce (2) was good. Just the right amount of spiciness for me. (Btw, they rate the spicy sauce by numbers 1-5 with 1 being least spiciest). It was $6 with tax already included. I don't think I'll be returning. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"It's a fine place for a fast bite. Employees give off the too cool for school vibe but are nice and friendly. It must come naturally after dealing with hordes of drunk people who let out from the clubs and bars.  If you want a burrito and you're close by stop by. Don't go out of your way (especially since they have other locations). Price point is decent."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a quick grab and go lunch, give or take a few minutes depending on the line up. The cashier is ALWAYS friendly no matter who it is!  $9.50 for a steak burrito with all the fixings and NO jalapenos por favor! My friends think it's expensive, until they realise how much food they get. You can always save half for later. Other places it's $10 for ONE meal, at Big Fat you can easily get two out of one burrito (if you're an average eater). Now they have tacos too, gotta try them out.  Friendly, reliable, delicious and cost effective."}
{"text":"Great urban design style and service, burrito is flavourful but not as fat as advertised and hyped.  Worth trying if you're in the Kensington market area!"}
{"text":"2.5/5  Well, the burritos are certainly big and fat. The 'large' weighs as much as a newborn baby. They need to reassess their portions and perhaps heat scale. If the medium was this bland, I can't imagine what the mild is like. They stuff the darn things with way too much lettuce and tomato. This makes the burritos taste bland and too homemade-like. It also takes away from the warmth and texture of the rice and meat. In my case, the cheese wasn't even melted. This place doesn't stack up to Burrito Boyz at all. One thing you can do is to limit your toppings (especially the fillers) and ask them to grill it for a bit longer. If you like spice, go for the spicy and ask for even more hot sauce."}
{"text":"It's pretty hard to introduce me to a burrito that I don't like. I used to think that Big Fat Burrito was pretty much the bees knees, and I still very much enjoy it. I know I risk getting my ass kicked in saying this, but I do prefer, to this staple of beloved Kensington Market (\"for which I have the utmost respect...\") the...ahem...(braces self) *American chain*, Chipotle. Sacrilegious, I know, but my food is not about politics, ~sorry~.  Anyway, glad I got that off my chest.  I do eat here pretty frequently, and like it a lot. They are generously filled, and I do greatly appreciate not having to pay extra for guacamole (which seems to be the case at most places, especially...well, you-know-who...), but on occasion, I feel distressed by the cold sections of filling that I often bite into. They also once accidentally gave me half-sweet potato (like my friend had ordered), and I don't even know why they have that stuff in the first place (I kid). I ate it anyway, and it was alright, if just a little too squishy. An adequate metaphor for my thoughts as a whole, I'd say."}
{"text":"I hit up this place while on the cupcake crawl.  This wasn't the best and definitely not the worst burrito I've had.  I wish there was a sign or something at burrito places that grill your burrito so that I could be warned that they're going to turn the nice crisp lettuce, tomato, and cool sour cream into a warm heap of mush.  The prices are comparable to other places in the city.  You're going to pay $6-9 depending on the meat you want and the size (small or large).  For me this burrito lacked individual flavour and was overly sauced (it was dripping everywhere)."}
{"text":"I am still forever loyal to Burrito Boyz but Big Fat Burrito is closer to home and less busy most of the time.  Their burritos are big and fat, but only if you get the large. I like being able to customize the hotness, so the hotter, the better. Their veggie burrito is great, the beef one I had was a little bit gross due to fatty meat.  The thing I love about this place is the drink selection -- grab an old-fashioned soda pop bottle and sit by the window. Careful, it gets chilly in winter, but is a great place to people-watch."}
{"text":"Having spent all last week eating burritos I feel qualified to offer my $0.02 here. Nothing too stunning about this Kensington burrito hole. The food is tasty, but burrito competition is fierce in Toronto and this isn't one the front runners. Still, you get to choose your hot sauce and the prices aren't worse than other spots. Also, I'm not sure why people are mentioning the numbering system like it's a brilliant piece of organizational technology; Burrito Boyz does it too, but with laminated cards(!). Big deal.  Obligatory Title Pun: BIG FAT nothing special.  Menu Readability: Multicolored letter magnets above the counter! Nostalgic.  Need to mention: If you are the type or person for whom 'peoplewatch' is a verb, then this is a good place to 'peoplewatch'.  What this place teaches me about myself: Peoplewatching is overrrated."}
{"text":"A light 3. The steak is kind of tough, the rice flavour off and the overall portion size kind of small.  Better burrito options exist."}
{"text":"These definitely aren't the best burritos I've ever had, especially for the price, but they're still super tasty and I like the different options available. Great organizational system with numbers and calling out numbers and all that good stuff. They only take cash....for some reason that always bugs me, but there is an atm in the restaurant.   Mostly I like Big Fat Burrito for its location! There's nothing better than snagging a window seat with your packed burrito and people watching, especially if its a pedestrian Sunday. If you can't get a seat, take it to go and wander the market, it won't fall apart on you."}
{"text":"Been staying in the building across street for years..never tried this one..Glad I took the risk. There used to be several burrito places nearby. Tried one which is now gone. That was my first burrito. Kinda break the deal...Hard rice, running sauce...But this one saved the reputation of burrito for me. :)"}
{"text":"I used to eat here often back in the day when I lived in the area. I remember the burritos being bigger and better. Recent visit, burrito was good, but nothing exceptional to rave about; too much rice and not as much meat as I remembered. I got mine with medium heat and couldn't taste any heat at all.  Overall, decent place to get burritos if you're in the area. I believe the posted prices include taxes already which is nice not having to do the math."}
{"text":"MMMM!  Sweet potatoes are my absolute favourite vegetable so I was thrilled to see them as a filling option at Big Fat Burrito. The place is always teeming with people and it has limited seating, but the burrito is so tightly and expertly packed that you can easily take it away to eat in the park or on a bench somewhere.  I'm impressed with their organized ordering system (you get a number and it appears on a callout marquee when it's ready) and it's relatively quick to order and get your food!"}
{"text":"I've been here before but only vaguely remembered details of that order.  Today, I went there again, for lunch.  I needed a grab and go one.  Luckily, there wasn't a line up today, and I felt welcomed right away by one of the attendents working behind the counter.    I ordered a small veggie burrito, $6.00 (tax included).  They asked if I liked Yam, to which I said no (a phase I'm going through). The burrito came with instant? rice, beans, a bit of cheese, lettuce.  The ratings on Yelp are all over, like a rainbow - with every # out of 5 stars, being given.  I asked for Chipotle sauce and he asked if I wanted jalapenos, I said a few.  He also wanted to know if I also wanted Burrito sauce or sour cream.  I went for the sauce.   In the end, it wasn't TOO intense.  Spicy, but still enjoyable.  It took them about 3-6 minutes to prep my burrito.  :)  The taste was ok.   ~~~ It was a good experience.   I'd be open to going again at some point, but I loooove going to Mexican Salsas Grill for my $4.99 veg burritos (found further south on Augusta, just past Nassau St.).  I'd be curious about other ppl's comparisons, too.  Let me know which burrito in Kensington Market, is best."}
{"text":"Good burritos. Good value. Friendly staff. Fast service.  I'm a vegetarian so I've only had the veggie and the yam (prefer the veggie).   They have a good selection of eclectic sodas and iced teas.  I always stop by here if I need a quick and cheap bite to eat in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Awesome, huge, tasty, delicious burritos. All made and cooked to order. My favourite is the beef, but the pulled pork is great too.  The only down side is the size. There is limited seating and so can sometimes find yourself waiting for a seat."}
{"text":"I'll start by mentioning that I love my burritos and am a huge fan of Burrito Boyz and was told by a few people that this burrito was just as good if not better.  Well I was lied to, I was very disappointed with the burrito. The meat tasted like they used a sloppy joe mix pack to flavor the meat and when I bit into it it was all cold.  Needless to say, I'll be sticking with Burrito Boyz for my burrito fix"}
{"text":"The burritos here are good though not the best in the city.  They are quite large though and make for a more than adequate lunch.  Hint: the spicier the better!"}
{"text":"Well I was suppose to meet up with the yelp gang before the Handlebar party but my work kept me soooooooooo late that I arrived at 6:50.... Thinking that the gang is probably already getting the bill, I stopped here instead to eat before the party.  I was hoping for a quick cheap bite, like $5 but their burritos were around $8+ so I opt for a $3 taco with everything on top.   And it was so so delicious!!! Maybe I was hungry. Maybe I just love anything with spicy salsa. Maybe anything with chips too. The taco was crisp and the ground beef was great. Yum!!!!  There is also a vegetarian taco.  The tables are quite dirty.."}
