{"text":"Great coffee! High quality. Each cup prepared individually to order. Same goes for tea."}
{"text":"Passing through the town and stopped in. Great atmosphere!  Aroma is amazing even before you walk in. I ordered chai which they make in-house everyday; DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Outstanding coffee is what you want and Therefore outstanding coffee is what you get when you visit Mugshots Coffee in Belmont NC. Darrin and Rueben take care of each and every customer with a personal touch, making your coffee experience a memorable one."}
{"text":"Every cup is made to order with a Chemex. They now have nitro on tap and their booch is always changing. Cute shop in small town location."}
{"text":"In response to the owner:

Glad you recognized us! At 6PM, convenience wins! As per our visit, I didn't order coffee but wanted to give your chai a try. You were sold out which is understandable. House made syrups, local dairy, and standard barista practices like scaling your espresso dose to ensure consistency are all things that I look for in a 3rd wave shop. We will definitely keep giving Mugshots a chance because we love coffee and we love Belmont. It would be amazing to have a true 3rd wave shop in our town! I know you guys are working on improving things and we will stay tuned. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Mugshots is my favorite coffee shop. These people are passionate about what they do and it shows. 
Lavender vanilla latte and home brewed kombucha are amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. From the moment you walk in the door to receiving your carefully crafted coffee drink, the experience is nothing short of excellent. Darren, Reuben and Amanda are experts when it comes to the quality of their products and services - they are always striking friendly conversation with their patrons while simultaneously concocting a delicious drink. If you like fresh coffee and friendly conversation, you must check this spot out."}
{"text":"Best coffee in our area, hands down!!  Friendly and knowledgeable owners/staff, great selection of quality coffees, great patio area.  This is NOT your usual coffee experience.  These guys are the real deal and my absolute favorite!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee.  Love this independent shop. Super nice folks. I highly recommend the house blend drip in addition to the single origins.  


I love a great blend and this one fosho."}
{"text":"Found this little coffee shop on our drive to Asheville from Charlotte.  What an amazing find!  Not only are they doing delicious things with coffee beans, they also make their own nitro cold brew AND kombucha!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best cold brew I've ever had!  Also they make their kombucha and chai in house... Pretty awesome. This kind of quality and passion is what I've been looking for in coffee shops around Gaston county. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent cold nitro brew.  Great service and great guys running a small business.  Don't miss this spot in downtown Belmont."}
{"text":"Happen to stop by this cute place. Homemade chai tea! the kombucha is so flavorable! The espresso was perfect.
Friendly and very knowledgeable staff.
Great prices 
Will be back to try the breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great selection of specialty coffee drinks and delicious kombucha on tap as well! Went here a couple Saturdays ago with some friends, and our barista was super sweet, friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great coffee at a slow pace. 

We stopped by on an afternoon for a quick drink. The coffee itself was very flavorful and at a fair price. The interior is cute but very small. The patio has some nice seating options and since Main Street doesn't usually have much traffic the proximity to the road is just fine. I would say the wait for coffee is a little unexpected and could be improved. I'm a fan of waiting for great things but coffee is a tough wait. I will totally be back but make time for it."}
{"text":"Happened to stop in to Mugshots Coffee & Tea when searching for a nice local coffee shop to do some afternoon work. Darren was super helpful to describe the different options and share about what was in each one. 

I eventually chose the S'mores latte ... YES, they do toast the giant marshmallow with a mini flame torch for that delicious caramelized taste to enjoy through the whole cup. So glad to have found this place! :) they make a great cup of coffee! 

Support your local businesses! This place just achieved their 1 year anniversary and I hope they'll be here and successful for many many years beyond this."}
{"text":"Great spot, Belmont's newest and coolest gem.  The owner is friendly, knowledgeable and passionate about his craft.  Don't expect the big coffee chain mass production line.  He takes thought with each handcrafted drink, from his Chemex pour over coffees (wow!) to his specialty Lattes he posts regularly (decadent, delicious!).  Can't wait for warmer weather so we can enjoy the expansive patio area."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Super nice staff and delicious coffee, tea and latte.. yum!  Hope they get more merchandise. Love the logo and what they do have. We got a cool mug."}
{"text":"Went with friend, it wasn't bad at all
Got cup of coffee little bit different then these franchise Starbucks and other coffee shops. Was good for most of the part. Thanks"}
{"text":"It's average coffee, I wouldn't say it is anything super special. The space is small and cozy and welcome and the outdoor space is cute. It's very very standard."}
{"text":"This is a great place..  Always friendly and welcoming.. Today I had a chilled Lemon Bar for a mid-day snack that was out of this world.  Their Chai Latte (made fresh daily) was a welcome departure from my usual morning latte 
(Ristretto Latte with 1 Sugar-in-the-Raw and a touch of cinnamon)

I probably shouldn't be saying this publically, but one day I asked Darren to slice a homemade blueberry muffin,  and fry it in butter.. It was really good.. Always good to try new things.."}
{"text":"Easily the best coffee in Gaston County, maybe the best I've had in North or South Carolina. The beans are extraordinarily high quality and these guys have perfected the art of steaming milk. No hissing and screaming from their milk steamers. Also, they have nitrobrew coffee! Redbull doesn't give you wings; nitrobrew does. 

If you love coffee, give Mugshots a try. You'll never go back to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Chill vibe with unique and creative coffee drinks, kombucha, and more"}
{"text":"Out of towners trying out a quick coffee joint. The pastries are INCREDIBLE, breakfast sandwiches are good and the atmosphere is perfect. If I ever have the opportunity to come back, I definitely will!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I think I came one of the first weekends they were open.  I've been back once or twice more.  Basically, whenever I'm in Belmont visiting my parents, I find an excuse to go.  Chai was good.  Tea was good.  Coffee was good.  When you find a place that makes good pour over coffee, you just keep going back.
Reminds me of a super, small scale Onyx (Northwest Arkansas) when they started out.  Would love to see this place grow like they did."}
{"text":"Great coffee & food selection, and couldn't be run by nicer people! Stopped in here while on a ride through Belmont and was pleasantly surprised. The full assortment of any coffee you might like (espresso, drip, pour-overs, cold brew, nitro, and I'm sure some others I'm forgetting), and a solid selection of food from doughnuts and cookies to muffins and breakfast sandwiches. Owners couldn't be friendlier, would recommend this place to anyone -- especially cyclists rolling through town!"}
{"text":"Small coffee shop ran by police. Has a small selection of snacks. I got the iced mocha and it is delicious! I will definitely be back and will for sure recommend to all my friends. Word is they'll be getting a patio and start serving alcohol (including absinthe!). Just make sure you bring a designated driver"}
{"text":"Oh Mugshots, how I love thee. From chai to Mexican mocha and seasonal faves like PSL and Peppermint I just can't get enough. When you add in tasty breakfast sandwiches and sweet treats, you're unstoppable. Best coffee shop in the surrounding counties."}
{"text":"Mugshots is a recent edition to the greater Charlotte area, and boy was it an excellent one! Darren (from the Bay Area, CA) is super nice, friendly, and inviting to all who come into the shop.

Today alone, I've had one Brazilian Pour over (which was freaking incredible, BTW) and one chai [house-made, and with almond milk of course. Excellent in quality and taste.

If you're looking for great coffee (or other related drinks) AND a nice shop - look no further.

Grateful to have Mugshots in the area! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee and food AND great service! We came here on recommendation from friends and as a self-proclaimed coffee snob I can be a bit choosy. This place is a gem! Small space but lots of outdoor seating. The coffee is really good and you can tell they very much care about the quality. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Belmont, NC. Cozy atmosphere to relax in. Great guys run the shop, and they're fun to talk to."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm lactose intolerant so I have to do almond milk coffee drinks.  If you have had an almond milk latte before, then you know that they can be watery and lack flavor if not prepared correctly.  Not the case here.  For a minute, I almost forgot it wasn't cow's milk.  Nice and rich with a good creamy texture, and the coffee was smooth and strong, while not overpowering.  

I think these guys are onto something.  I, like the other reviewer, appreciate the conversation.  Too many businesses treat customers like it's a cattle herd.  I like that the owners are willing to take a moment to chat and exchange pleasantries.  That's how you build a loyal customer base.   

Also love that the beans and teas are fresh enough that you can smell them when you walk in the door.  Don't change that!  And I look forward to trying the chai.  

Good start, now keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place is just what Belmont needed. At first, you may think... \"well this is just another coffee shop... its all going to taste the same\" NOT THE CASE!! The first time I visited this cute quaint little coffee shop,I was greeted with a friendly smile and warm welcome.  I was unsure of what to order, so I went with a latte! I told them that I liked my lattes with a little flavor but not too sweet (in which case I would normally say I only want one pump of vanilla). WELL, this adorable coffee shop only uses natural sweeteners!! HOW AWESOME IS THAT?? They whipped up a maple cinnamon latte and it was literally one of the best lattes I have EVER had! It was just the right amount of sweet with a cinnamon finish! Because of that ONE latte, I now have an addiction to this place! I have started stopping EVERY morning before work...it is the one part of starting my day that I get overly excited about :) 
They also make breakfast sandwiches (which I'm sure are DELICIOUS) however, I had the HOMEMADE blueberry scone.. THAT'S RIGHT... I said HOMEMADE! I typically do not go for sweets but I literally inhaled the scone and didn't feel guilty about any of those calories!
I do know that they offer so much more than the latte and the good news is, if you are unsure of what to order the owners will always help you out and give you suggestions!!

If you are in Belmont, PLEASE take a moment to visit Mugshots Coffee and Tea!! It is well worth the stop!!

** BONUS** They also make HOMEMADE WHIPPED CREAM! YUM YUM"}
{"text":"Very original teeny, tiny coffee shop. From the name to the coffee blends on display, the owners make an effort to put their personal stamp on the typical hometown corner cafe. The coffees they serve are from all over the world and they pull off comfy without being too kitschy. The coffee was roasted to perfection and sweet without sugar!"}
{"text":"It's rare that I get a coffee drink and after every sip have to tell my husband \"this is sooo good!\"  Stopped in today and got the salted caramel latte by recommendation of the barista. Fabulous."}
{"text":"Hands down the best coffee I've ever had and the guys who work here are always in a great mood. Awesome place for your morning coffee, always leave with a smile. I wish I could give it six stars!"}
{"text":"Best place around! Amazing coffee and lattes and superb owners! Everyone is so friendly they even know you by name. Their coffee is the real deal! Starbucks has nothing on Mugshots!"}
{"text":"Awesome new coffee house in Belmont, NC.
Coffee varieties are tasty and great. Great, friendly folks that own and started this place!!
Congrats to you both!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is great and the coffee is worth the wait. It's small and quaint but they have plenty of outdoor seating when the weather is nice. Try the lavender vanilla latte, you won't be disappointed! The regular pour over coffee is great too!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST MOCHA I'VE EVER TASTED!!!!  The skim latte was also great! We'd topped here while traveling from Davidson to Greenville on a Sunday morning. I would avoid this time again just because the church across the street shares their parking lot and it was mayhem!! Definitely worth the stop though!"}
{"text":"I loved it!  It's quite small, yet cozy.  Awesome customer service!  Coffee was REALLY great!  Very nice, safe neighborhood to walk about."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It may be small but it is mighty.  The Mexican Mocha is divine.  And the baked goods are delicious.  This is the only place around where you can get Nitro Cold Brew.  
Go, go, go!"}
{"text":"YOU GUYS. I almost left this place the first time I tried it out because the line was long and pour over coffee takes time. Luckily my boyfriend made me stay. I was kind of irritated until I drank that first sip of coffee!!!! Then I literally came back 6 days in a row because the coffee was beyond phenomenal. It was so smooth and not bitter in the slightest. I am not a coffee expert by a long shot but this place is a freaking GAME CHANGER. Now I literally cannot imagine getting fresh coffee anywhere else. I had never had pour over coffee until I came here, and Darren the owner is so awesome and you can tell there is a lot of thought and pride that goes into this place. Do not even think about going to another \"coffee\" place in Belmont. This is the real deal and it will completely change your coffee drinking experience! I cannot wait to try that housemate chai but I'm too addicted to the pour over coffee right now. So happy this place is in Belmont!!! Go right now and thank me later!!"}
{"text":"This coffee is the best i've ever had and their kombucha and lattes are the bomb.com, I highly recommend this coffee."}
{"text":"Get some of the best coffee you'll ever have in your life. Not only that but you'll probably learn something while you're there thanks to the incredibly friendly and knowledgeable owners Darren and Rufus. This place is a great asset to our wonderful and growing downtown"}
{"text":"Went today for the first time. Very welcoming and cozy. I had the lavender vanilla latté. It was fantastic! I can't wait to go back. They know their coffee!"}
{"text":"Finally. FINALLY. A coffee shop worth its salt in Belmont. Quality beans, expert crafting, and friendly owners. I wish there was more room to chill out inside, but I'll deal with that if it means thy I can have quality coffee without having to drive into Charlotte.  Can't wait to see how they do!"}
{"text":"What's not to like?
It's close by (convenient), owners are very personable, and the coffee is good!

You can text ahead w your order and just dash in to pick up. 

Best wishes for success"}
{"text":"This hole in the wall coffee shop has become my new guilty pleasure in Belmont after a long day teaching high school. The owners Reuben and Darren brew incredible coffee. Their pour over brewing method requires some patience on the part of the customer, but the end result is an exceptional tasting cup of coffee. Additionally, their mochas and lattes are excellent my particular favorite is the Mexican mocha with an extra shot of espresso. They are still trying to get me to try their house-made Kombucha but I have to draw the line somewhere. Right now the line is caffeine."}
{"text":"Darren and Rueben are masters of their craft. The atmosphere, location and product is just what Belmont needs... the best part is that this place is good even in comparison to the big city coffee places that people rave about. Their iced pour overs are amazing, their iced caps are amazing, their cold brew is amazing.. even their scones and baked goods are excellent.

Go here."}
{"text":"Very good artisan coffee, hand brewed.  Tea, chai and espresso drinks available.
If you wish to hang out, they serve in a REAL mug."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything I'm looking for in a small town coffee shop. Darren was super knowledgeable about coffee. He seems to be a really nice guy and loves what he does. It's so cool to see amazing coffee being done in such a small town. I got to buy coffee from an 80 year old lady who owns the farm and the beans were roasted just two weeks ago. These guys are the real deal! I hope they have tons of success here in Belmont. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Relaxed atmosphere~Serious coffee. 

An exceptional balance that proves that the two best friends and who opened and run this coffee shop, along with their staff, are not just here to grind beans and press buttons. They truly are breathing lifeblood into the community through their hot drinks and warm smiles. Every customer is greeted with care, with a relentless pursuit of quality and happiness, all culminating into a very unique yet welcoming experience. 

I assume if you're still reading this that you're a new customer. So as a regular I'd like to provide some pointers to help get the best out of your experience. 

1. Be prepared to wait for your order. 
This is a coffee bar. A social experience. You won't find a maze of Point of Sale merchandise that you're herded through, or a ton employees whizzing around to the sound of giant coffee machines doing their job for them. Come in, hang out, enjoy the atmosphere, and appreciate the coffee bar for what it is, an immersive and unique experience.

2. Don't be overwhelmed by the names and styles of coffee.
If you come in and you're not sure where to start, don't hesitate to ask. Much like a good bartender, they'll be happy to steer you in the right direction. If it's busy and crowded, let someone ahead of you and take your time. By all means, if you know what you like, they'll be happy to make it for you, but also consider stepping out of your coffee box and experience coffee the way it was meant to be.

3. More than just the daily grind.
Things to try outside of coffee and espresso.
Kombucha~ A delicious fermented tea that's slightly effervescent, and carries a bevy of health benefit that have been touted for years. Made in house, the flavor and quality is unprecedented.
Cold Brew~ Brewed in house, and made from their single origin beans, this delicious use of coffee opens up a completely different level of flavor and is served on nitro just like you'd find at your local microbrewery. The process extracts a different profile from the bean and is definitely worth giving a \"shot\".
Loose Leaf Tea~ Brewed by the cup from selectively sourced options like Earl Grey, Dragonwell Green Tea and Red Scare Rooibos, if coffee isn't for you, this just may be your cup of tea.
Food~ Need a snack to pair with your beverage? Breakfast sandwiches, paninis, and an assortment of seasonal pastries are at your disposal.

Whether you're new to the area, a seasoned local, or just passing through, if you're looking for a one of a kind experience that masters all the senses,  stop being a criminal to your taste buds and head to Mugshots."}
{"text":"I love this place. I can't believe I don't have to drive for 20+ minutes to get great coffee and great atmosphere anymore. Their coffee is awesome, Darren and Rueben are great and the shop is very cozy. Oh, and I finally tried their kombucha, it is so good."}
{"text":"This place is legit. When you order an iced coffee, they don't pull out a jug of coffee that has been sitting in the cooler for hours (maybe days even)...no....they brew the coffee over ice RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. So fresh. So tasty. Their drinks are completely made to order so make sure you have a good 5-10 mins if you want something that requires brewing and/or cooling down. They have really delicious donuts from a local CLT bakery on Sundays (but get there early!) and other sweets that satisfy my craving for chocolate during the week. Great atmosphere and fellas that work there too!"}
