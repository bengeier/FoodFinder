{"text":"Gus is really friendly and gives you a better price if you call the store rather than order online.  The pepperoni pizza we ordered was good:
- right amount of cheese
- tasty mozzarella
- crust crisp on the outside, soft in the middle
- just enough pepperoni
- sweet sauce with a basil flavour 
- not greasy like Dominos or little Caesars
We will definitely order from square boy in Brooklin again (pizza nova too)."}
{"text":"Tastes like Mcain Rising Crust Pizza from the grocery store.  Many other options in town that are way better."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good, soft pillowy doughy slices of goodness.
So why the one star?  A few months ago there was a misunderstanding when the their debit machine stopped working and I'd sent my husband out to pick up an order.
When I called back to cancel it once I'd figured out what the kid on the phone was saying to me (to say he wasn't well spoken was an understatement), the owner yelled at me!!! And when I tried to apologize he hung up on me.  We used to be frequent customers but we will never go back."}
{"text":"Okay...
Heres the thing, I have never had the product from this place but I have ordered from here.

So, I needed to order a pizza to be delivered to a party that I wasn't attending.
I spoke with the owner \"GUS\"  about what I was looking for ...
The pizza had to be delivered by 11 am for the party.
The problem was that he didn't deliver before noon but Gus said not to worry he would close up shop and deliver it personally!
He took my order and told me to just drop by after work to square up with him, wow talk about old school values...
I called the to make sure that the pizza did arrive on time and it did and was devoured!
So... I will definately be ordering a pizza and doing another review on the food but based on the quality of his customer service..it should be fantastic!"}
