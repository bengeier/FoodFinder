{"text":"Food is good but if you order to go the portions are way smaller than if you eat in. Ordered 2 orange chickens and should have gotten 2 small rice but got 1 large rice container instead, they told me it's more than 2 small ones. I know it's not and they wanted over $4 for another rice. I ate in 3 days before and got the amount for 2 to go on the plate when I ate in for half the price. It's a rip off if you take to go BEWARE!"}
{"text":"I was looking for an Asian Restaurant, when I stumbled upon Yin's. The reviews were good and I was only a few blocks away. I went in and ordered chicken fried rice, yuing chicken and mongolian beef. I love chicken but, the beef was the most tender, flavorful meat I have ever eaten. Now I am a regular for life!"}
{"text":"The people are very kind, the food was really good, fats service, and the inside is really nice. I would definitely come back and recommend Yin's"}
{"text":"Not very good. Crab ragoons tasted like store bought cream cheese...with no crab. Chicken and broccoli was eh. Vegtable fried rice barely had vegetables in it..wouldn't go again. Way better places to go for decent Chinese food"}
{"text":"We've been going to Yin's for about 15 years and have to tell you it's one of the few restaurants where the quality has never varied. Everything is always excellent. We've loved everything we've had. Favorites include the Canton Style Fish (with black bean sauce), Orange Beef, Schezwan Pork, Chicken and Snow Peas, and Lemon Chicken (which is out of this world).   We've seriously tried to find a better Chinese restaurant and never could."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food with quality!!

Family owned business and wonderful people there. 
hot and sour soup and vegetable egg fu-young are our favorites"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, service was good. Fed 3 ppl for less then 30$ with extra to take home."}
{"text":"Egg fo young to die for and dumplings that remind me of Chinatown NYC. Don't miss out on this amazing restaurant"}
{"text":"This place has the best Won Ton soup! I've been coming to this place since I was 6 and the food is still good. The plates are pretty big for the price. It's a small quiet place where you can go and eat in peace when you're trying to stay away from crowded noisy restaurants"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, it wasn't exceptional, just an average Chinese joint I won't bother to rush back to. I ordered the eat in combo with egg drop soup (kinda mushy) and kung pao chicken. I'd give a C or C- overall given the ambiance."}
{"text":"First time there, saw good reviews, thought \"Why not? Might be a hidden diamond in the rough of bad Arizona Chinese food.\" Ordered the Pork Lo Mein as it allowed me to try their noodles, as well as fried rice. No flavor. I could only tell i was eating different portions of the meal by feeling the varied shapes of food in my mouth. The service was on point, and nothing tasted bad, but then again, i didn't taste anything at all."}
{"text":"I live less than a mile from this place and only recently became a regular customer. I am sort of a Chinese food snob, and this strip mall is a little shady so was hesitant to go. However, since we discovered this gem, my husband and I have loved all the dishes we have ordered so far, especially sizzling rice soup and house egg foo young. 

Do not be put off by the appearance, or the fact that there are few wait staff. On busy nights you may have to wait for a bit, but it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"food is good and plentiful BUT the service is terrible. the employees seem to hide behind the counter which is hidden from the dining room. they drop the food at the table never to be seen again. so if u want drink refills or sauces or to go boxes or even the check you have to hunt them down."}
{"text":"Just happened to be working on some equipment in the plaza and decided it was time for lunch. Yin's was staring me right in the face and my stomach insisted that we visit.

Inside is painted pink of all colors and has several cheesy pictures of koi and other Chinese items on the walls. There are booths and some table with chairs and you can usually sit where you want.

This is some very Americanized Chinese food and they do a good job of creating some heavy and flavorful sauces. The portions are large and the prices are very reasonable.

So far we have tried a few of the lunch specials. I normally get mine extra spicy and my crew usually orders something on the tamer side. Even got a great suggestion from brother Laz C on my last visit and went with the Curried Chicken. Yum!

Service is kinda tricky and takes some effort to get them to your table. They seem to be in a zombie like state and appear somewhat preoccupied. Nothing like a little \"Psssst or Yoohoo\" to get their attention.

Going to play it safe and go with a A-OK rating for this place. Maybe I just like the authentic versions more than the typical Americanized stuff. But don't be surprised if you see me here again when we are working in the area. ORDER UP!

3.25 STARS"}
{"text":"All I can say is don't judge a book by its cover ...  This is a family owned and run place where the food is inexpensive but every dish is fresh, delishious! & flavorful. 

Their sauces are amazingly scrumptious. Yin's has to be my all-time favorite Chinese restaurants in Phoenix. I mean I know good Chinese food when I have it and considering the options available in Phoenix this is one of the better Chinese restaurants period.

They take standard dishes and add high-end ingredients and interesting flavors. They are very consistent (never had a bad meal). All the dishes are wonderful, you can't go wrong with anything.  Particularly good is their Wor Wonton Soup.

FOOD:  The food is always consistent (never had a bad meal). The food is superb!PRICE: The price was also quite reasonable. SERVICE:  the service has always been great  prompt, polite, and attentive.  AMBIENCE:  Just right for the neighborhood. The interior is rather standard Chinese restaurant fare, so nothing special there. CONCLUSION: I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"first timer here:

the food was quality and at a really good price. 

the location is not 5 star, however the food is well worth the venture for a dine in experience. 

everything we ordered (in pic) was crunchy where it should be, just the right spice, and sweet but not over powering. 

we have tried many chinese take out spots and this will be our new go-to."}
{"text":"I love this place! Been coming here with my family since I was a kid and lived within the neighborhood. Now we live miles away and we like to stop by every once in a while. My favorite dishes are Happy Family, Hose Lo Mein, House Fried Rice and their soups! Let's not forget their delicious and crispy Crab Angels. Yumm! I always recommend this for Chinese!"}
{"text":"I do love the food here.  Yin's is not much to look at from the outside of the building and I am not sure if I want to be in this neighborhood after dark but, oh, the food!  Hot, fresh and just the way I think it shoud taste every time.  The employees are nice and service fast.  A must try is the egg drop soup."}
{"text":"The Mongolian beef and the hot and sour soup are the best! Have been coming here since I was a little girl! Absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill.  The food is expensive and the quality is not what it used to be.  I was coming here for years,  but not what it used to be."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for about 20 years. It is family owned and they serve real authentic Chinese food. They don't have you wait, and the food is CHEAP. will definitely be back. Oh and they have amazing orange chicken too!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious food. The lemon chicken was great as well as the sweet and sour chicken. Nice and crispy with just the right amount of flavor in the sauce. Service is good too! Don't let the sketchy strip mall deter you, it's TOTALLY WORTH THE STOP! Yummmmmm!!!"}
{"text":"So I've ate here twice now... I'm a VERY picky eater when it comes to Chinese food! 

First time I had Kung Pao Chicken. Nothing to brag about.. I tried their egg drop soup.. NOT FOR ME. Big Hengs still has THE BEST EGG DROP SOUP IN TOWN! Like NO JOKE! 

The Second time, I ordered one of their House special items. Orange Chicken!! I usually don't like orange Chicken from the more authentic Chinese spots cuz they use a real tangerine/ orange sauce and the flavor to me on Chicken is not all that great or flavorful..(I guess thanks to Panda Express for my comparison on why I don't  like it) BUT HERE.! At Yins! Their Orange Chicken is THEEE BEST I've EVER TRIED in town (in my opinion)!! I highly suggest it if you eat here. You won't be disappointed. The sucky thing, it's not offered on the lunch special. At least I didn't ask... either way you won't be disappointed.

Definitely come for lunch rather dinner. It gets pricey if you be ballin in a budget like myself."}
{"text":"Best Chinese Restaurant in the valley. If you look meat and rice, this is your place. The Schezwan Pork is amazing as well is the sesame chicken. I used to live far away from this place but still drove there to eat their food. Now I live close and I do not hesitate to stop by. It may not look too pleasing from the outside but what does nowadays. Price Cheap to Moderate"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was decent for a place in a strip mall.  I ordered the Lo Mein off the lunch menu.  Portions were good.  Overall dish had a fishy smell yet there's no fish or shrimp in the dish. Lo Mein was cooked well, good mix of vegetables and Lo Mein.  Lo Mein itself lacked flavor. The order came with Fried Rice which was just terrible, no flavor at all.  Dish was also served with an egg roll, which was actually a vegetable spring roll in a light thin crispy wrapper, probably the best thing on the plate.  

They also charge an upcharge of 50 cents to use credit / debit cards. 

Definitely not the worst place, but if looking for decent Chinese food there's many other places.  If you're in the area of Talking Stick in Scottsdale, I urge you to check out Red House Chinese."}
{"text":"Yins has some of the best Chinese food in town.  This place is not fancy, but it does have decent chinese food for Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had sesame beef and house fried rice and I was not impressed. I try not to be so hard on restaurants because I did not grow up in this culture so I honestly don't know what is right or wrong, but I know what I like and this was tough.

First, I ordered over the phone at 4:58pm and arrived at 5:24pm only to wait until 5:37pm for my food because they want you to pay before they cook it...just say no phone orders!

The food was just okay. The rice had a lot of meat, but I could not differentiate between the types of meat. I didn't know if it was beef, chicken or pork. That's pretty bad. The sesame beef was gross there was so much sauce and it honestly tasted like orange and sweet and sour mixed. And the sauce was red.

Idk, you have to try it for yourself I guess but if you know a place that can deliver good food I would avoid this place altogether and go there."}
{"text":"I can agree with previous reviews asking the question \"What's up?\". Our food was very good on our last visit. Vegetables are cut big enough to taste them and not over powered by sauce. Orange beef flavorful, crispy with that hint of real orange. 
Visiting the bathroom I was applaud yes a bar of soap that was old and cracked. The liquid soap dispenser empty. Really? This so wrong Nancy. Don't you think patrons notice this?"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years. Semi-sketchy area, but delicious food. It's a little bit on the expensive side but the portions are pretty large. I can typically turn one order of the orange chicken into two meals."}
{"text":"I've only been here for take out and my bf always picks it up so I have never been inside. That being said this place is A-OK. Good food, fast service and they always get my order right. 

The Yin's dinner is more than two people should eat in a sitting but we always seem to manage. I love the beef and broccoli and the mongollian beef. The crab puffs are stellar. Just make sure to plan a big work out after to burn off all the calories you are sure to ingest."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb, I love their egg drop and hot and sour soup, egg rolls, pot stickers I can't get enough of it.  I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Chinese food, blah except for the egg too young. The wings are great though. Id only go there to pick up wings, the atmosphere is kinda lacking. The service is ok but the star of the show is definitely the wings."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service, reasonable prices and generous portions.  Traditional Chinese fare.  Difficult to find all the attributes together in most Phoenix restaurants.  Nothing fancy.  Only negative is that they don't deliver but I'll drive.  Worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite go to for Hunan, Szechuan Asian food in Phoenix. I used to live nearby and since I moved will stop by when in the area. Family owned, they've been there 20yrs or longer (I've seen their kids grow up) and always friendly service. Their dishes are authentic. 

Located in a strip mall but don't let that discourage you. Decor is modest but look past that and give their food a try, this is a hidden gem. You won't be disappointed if you love Asian food. They also have a great lunch special menu which includes an egg roll, soup and tea with your entree.

I always get the Scallops and Shrimp and the Family Style Bean Curd (fried tofu w/ veggies). I like lots of veggies in my dishes and Yin's doesn't disappoint. Loaded with broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms, snow peas, carrots and water chestnuts. The sauce in the Bean Curd is especially tantalizing. I have also tried the Happy Family, Garlic Chicken and a few other dishes. Happy Family has pork, beef, chicken and shrimp in it. Great flavor! 

Oooh, can't wait till I end up on that part of town again!"}
{"text":"Run down little chinese place that hadn't been to in almost 15 years but I was really excited to find that their GARLIC CHICKEN LUNCH SPECIAL HASN'T CHANGED.  

If you were part of the hoards that used to try to cram in at Yin's in the late 90's and remember that deliciously spicy garlic sauce, they are still there.  Check it out.  Cheap as all the others, but this dish they corner the market."}
{"text":"May I say wow!!
For the longest time a hesitated about trying food from this place. Sorry for that maybe after trying so many places for the right rice and good Chinese.
I was looking in the wrong places the good stuff it's here 
We had the kung pao chicken, vegetable fried rice, and shrimp noodles everything was really good.
Totally coming back."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday for lunch. Got sweet and sour chicken lunch special. $6.45 after tax. 50 cent charge for using card. Egg roll was good the fried rice was meh... not bad but not great and the chicken was good. Big lightly breaded pieces with some veggies in a nice sauce. Overall decent lunch spot. May be back."}
{"text":"The reason for the 2 stars is this... The food is great! However the costumer service is not. I ordered 3 entreys and it came out to close to $40.00 and people this was a take out order. Yikes! I'm not a cheap skate but come on. I didn't get any crispy chips to put in my egg drop flower soup or fortune cookies in my to go box or even a menu so I can  order in the later future. Ugh this is so frustrating. The inside needs help it feels like I stepped back in time. With how much they charge you would think they would be able to afford to freshen up the place .. 
 This is the reason I go way out of my to go get reasonable Chinese take out. I will never come back to this place I rather go to a nicer place that has better service and better prices. 
 Beware don't use their bathrooms the use bar soap for use to wash your hands yuck! The cleaning of the bathroom is sketchy I felt like I was going to catch some aweful germs."}
{"text":"Yin's is a staple of the neighborhood and beyond. Over the decade I've been eating there the food has been consistent and of consistently high quality. The service is great, friendly and attentive and the decor is neat and uncluttered.

Special favorites are the pan-fried dumplings, Sesame Chicken and Kung-Pao. Also great are the Beef with Snow Peas and the Pork Ribs. 

Dining is casual but they only do dine-in and take-out, so be prepared for a visit, even if you are eating at home."}
{"text":"This is my favorite cheap Chinese place in Phoenix.  The food is very well priced, especially during the lunch hour. The food is on the very high end for cheap Chinese food. I enjoy the king pao chicken.  I have taken work colleagues here, and they all agree that it is the top tier low end Chinese food. The dinner menu has larger portions, so it is still a good deal."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Yin's since they opened at this location in 1994.  Consistently a great place for great Chinese.  Curry chicken, wor won ton soup, dumplings, lo mein, and lemon chicken are tops.  Hard to find quality service and food like this elsewhere."}
{"text":"They charge you extra for eating in only can order a la carte no combos ... Doesn't make sense. We took one look at the menu and walked out. Also additional charge for using credit cards"}
