{"text":"WHAT A JOKE!! Just went to the St. Patricks day party... We have been hanging out  here for the last 6 years and have been to the party before. We haven't been to the party for a couple of years but this was a complete joke. NO IRISH FOOD, NO IRISH MUSIC, and Green Coors or Bud ???? They had food trucks serving hamburgers, and rented booths selling overpriced garbage. We paid $10 each for cover and paid $7 for draft beer?? Then we got ripped off for $40 for three burgers and fries from the food truck?? It used to be THEIR food and it used to be cool.  Now for the music. I have no idea who thought this up? Some guy on stage attempting to be a one man band trying to do mixed up covers of Eminem and other rap/ R&B radio crap... They used to have an excellent band that rocked!    Not sure who put this together, but the only thing Irish about this party was the green clothes.    Next year we will find a pub that is actually an IRISH pub... Good luck"}
{"text":"Didn't have a very good experience.... Ordered some wings and told the bartender how I wanted them and when I got my order it was the exact opposite! No apology , no can I get you a new order! In fact he didn't care, I had to ask if I could get the order I wanted and all Eric said was \"if it's wrong it's wrong!\" Really where did you learn your customer service????? Even after I paid my bill and tipped him he NEVER SAID SORRY OR THANK YOU! I'll never go back! And I'm in the industry !!"}
{"text":"We came during happy hour. Not sure on what all the different beers cost normally but our black and tans were $2.50 and the food was half off. We made the mistake of ordering nachos and chicken fingers, the nachos were pretty grande and would have been enough for two on their own. They come with chili. I like chili on my nachos.   Most of the people in the bar were ravenously feeding the slot machines, I felt a little out of place not slapping the buttons in front of my face.   Staff was polite and attentive. I'll definitely go back as long as happy hour is on."}
{"text":"Me and my husband both work in the service industry him as a bartender and i as a cocktail waitress at a 5star casino.We both played $40 and tipped well and couldnt get a single comped drink!!!what a joke!We dont gamble our whole paycheck away,just a lesiurely night out to play a couple bucks so I understand not comping multiple drinks but one round??We were blown away and will never return bc of that and the HORRIBLE attitude and service by Eric the bartender.We were prepared to tip heavily and instead payed our tab with their tip.Instead of Three Angry Wives you ended up with Two Angry Customers....."}
{"text":"Certain items are good, breakfast for the most part. I've tried to go several times because there close to the house and wanted a regular spot. Whenever I called to order I was treated as though I was a bother and felt very rushed. Each time I went in I was treated with a lot of attitude, and for all the wrong reasons! Word on the street is that there a bit on the racist side........ Don't let the one black bartender fool you, I felt like I was in 1890"}
{"text":"Nice seating specially the couch. The food was okay, I had the veggie platter and chicken wings. I like the fact that it was not too noisy, you can still carry a conversation here."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but the food is overpriced for what you get. I was disappointed to find that the pita pizza I ordered was very small for the price you pay for it. Usually pub food is great for the price but this place falls short. Bartenders are friendly though and keep checking on you. Overall, I would come back to have a drink but not have a meal."}
{"text":"Come see Eric swing shift!!! If your a gamer he takes care of you. Unlike most bars in this yuppie area. Ur good to him and he's good to you! . As far as food...every thing is great. The angry nachos are huge. U can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Fish n chips, crispy, tasty fries not cooked in same oil as fish :) crunchy n tasty. Large sandwich n wrap menu, looks like some big burgers"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews, however, our experience here was so unpleasant that I wanted to share it with potential customers.   My experience on day shifts has been okay, although I agree with Brent V. that the service has been slow, and \"uncaring\". However, the other evening my wife and a family friend went in to get a late night bite on the Graveyard shift. The main area is smoky to the point of causing nausea, and we went into the \"sealed\" dining room. My wife and her friend went up to the Bartender, Dan, to ask if it would be okay if we ate in the dining area; we'd be willing to pick up the food at the bar. I waited in the dining area.   What I overheard was possibly the most insulting bit of customer service that I have ever experienced. After my wife asked if we could eat in the dining area, Dan said, \"You two are in the wrong place, you need to leave!\" After he reiterated his feeling that the women had no business in the establishment (this conversation took less than 30 seconds), I decided I would go see what was going on. I asked Dan, \"What is going on?\", to which he said, \"Are you with those two girls?\". I said, \"Yes\" and Dan said, \"You need to leave, you're 86'd\".   I was flabbergasted! I assured Dan that I would be making my displeasure known, and he said, \"Good luck with that\".  Ordinarily, I would approach the owner about this type of behavior, however, short of terminating Dan, there isn't anything that \"The Wives\" could do to assuage my displeasure. Maybe he feels because he had a decent sized crowd around the video poker bar (I'm sure due to his charming personality) that he is untouchable. I don't know. All I know is that until the day comes that I hear, or receive an email that Dan has been summarily terminated I will not return to that establishment, and I will tell everybody I know about my experience with him."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast... Service was spot on and the food was good.  Tried the corn beef hash which was basic but tasty.  The sample platter was a good potion of fried food and good as well.  Great spot for a quick meal at a decent price.  Enjoyed the TV's and atmosphere.  Will return..."}
{"text":"Pretty standard pub, and kind of expensive.  I didn't go during happy hour (mistake), and I ordered the fish n chips (another mistake). Ended up paying a bit too much for food that was only okay in a place with a decently cool \"pub vibe\". However the beer was cold, and they had smithwick's on tap. (one of my fav's)"}
{"text":"Went here recently and the service was absolutely terrible.  Took them 30-40 minutes to get me my second beer and then anther 30-40 for me to get my check picked up.  It would be one thing if the waitress was clearly apologetic, the bar understaffed, and chaos unfolding for the poor folks staffing the place.  Unfortunately, the waitress didn't say a word as she dropped the beer off after my wait and didn't say a word about the delay in taking my check/card away.  No \"Here's your beer, very sorry about the wait...\" nothing.  What a joke.  Beer is decently priced."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in las Vegas been going here for 5 years. The staff is super friendly and the food portions are awesome. Also the lobby and 5 TV makes this one of the best places to watch sports in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"New to LV and found an Irish Pub just down the street from me. Good Irish fair and although I never tried the mussels, they sure looked good. Drinks are reasonable, their happy hour runs for a bit and the machines at the bar never took all my money. The leather seating area is a nice touch and great for socializing or a casual business meeting over a drink.   If you ever find yourself with an issue, management seems to have an open mind and prefers resolution over sour grapes.  They've lost my business due to a recent experience, but your mileage may vary greatly. I hope it does anyway..."}
{"text":"Slow service, actually felt sorry for the waitress as she was all alone. Sat next to the bar and tried to order food from the bartender \"I'm not your waitress\" was the response I received. Food was decent, service not so much. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Three angry wives has a bar that my husband and I have been to as well as another side where you can bring kids or just be away from the bar atmosphere. The bar is great....there are plenty of TVs to watch the games, sofas to relax on and plenty of regular seating. The food is great and the beer of course is good. We've tried the white mussels, the fish and chips, and the veggie panini, which were all great with the panini probably being the best sandwich I've had. The other side though isn't as great. There are only a couple TVs so it would be hard to watch the game here with our kids. Also it has a weird musty,  sweaty smell. Of course the good and beer are still great, but I wish the other side felt the love like the bar side which was why only the 4 stars.  I'm not 100 percent sure I would bring my kids back which unfortunately means I won't be able to go as much as I'd like."}
{"text":"Food is great but the waitress IQ is lower then a rock. The bar tender had to check on us 3 times while the waitress was messing with her hair! Again Great food!!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved watching the Pats game there. Bartenders were great and the BBQ chicken salad is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Cant say much about this place. Tried twice and was no good. Went during breakfast and the food sucked went again with the wife during the later hours and the food was worse. Plus the place smells like an ash tray. No thank you."}
{"text":"So I discovered you guys at 3-4 am this morning when I got off work(too tired to drive or move) on UberEATS. Your Pretzel bites, muscles, and then WINGSSSSS were SOOO BOMB! I now know where I will be ordering from when I get off work! (Because it's always 4 am approx and your hours work w my schedule which is AMAZING) seriously, keep it up. Love your food."}
{"text":"First off I want to say every time I come here the service is great. The staff is always friendly and the service is quick. The food is absolutely delicious. The Mediterranean sampler is amazing. Best food at a pub I've ever had. The drinks are also very reasonably priced. Good place to fill your belly with food and drink."}
{"text":"Reggie and Shannon are THE best. The service and atmosphere of this bar is great. True Irish hospitality. Gaming, food and great cocktails. If you are in the area and looking for a good time stop by. Lucky to have this bar in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Second visit to this restaurant and impressed with the menu.  For a neighborhood bar and grill, this place has a very extensive menu and the best fish and chips that we have had for a long time.  The kitchen is very accommodating in allowing me to order off the dinner menu for lunch.  Friendly service and one of the best parts. . . . . Notre Dame fans!!  We will be back."}
{"text":"This is a great place!  The food is good, and reasonably priced, and the lounge is very comfortable if you want to just hang out.  I have been going there for years, and will keep going back!"}
{"text":"This is a very unconventional place. You have to play at least a hundred dollars  in the machines  to get a drink comped. After I had already payed my seventy five dollar bill and spent 40 dollars on the machines , they couldn't even comp one drink. When I asked why the self proclaimed owner Danny ( i dont think hes the owner) said it was his right who gets comped and 86'd me.  Very  strange experience. It was like dealing with the soup nazi. Very angry people indeed.   There are some positives despite my bad experience.  The food is  really  good a lil pricey though. The music was pretty good a nice mix a rap and alternative if that is your style. Mostly a conservative crowd here so if you have liberal views your not going to be very welcomed.   The customer service ruined what could have been a promising place.  Id say go with steiners, bootleggers, pt's , instant replay or another irish pub."}
{"text":"Bar side is focused on players only. They have nice big screen TV's, but will Not turn on the sound, as it \"upsets the gamer's\". Yep, that's what we were told. Ok, turn off the Tv's and just stop pretending to be a sports bar! That is all. . ."}
{"text":"About as authentic as a shamrock shake. Ordered the corned beef and cabbage they gave us rubbery shaved deli meat two big quarters of watery unflavored cabbage and bland mashed potatoes from what I imagine came from a box. The beer list was pathetic only offering 3 americanized irish beers on tap including guinness draught not even offered at room temperature. Gross at best."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here one day.  I had the TAW Breakfast Burrito, it was huge and very tasty.  The service was good, and the beer was cold.  I'll have to stop here again some time on my way out to hike the Red Rock Canyon trails."}
{"text":"Trying the breakfast.  Having eggs Benedict and husband having corn beef and hash breakfast.  Food was very good.  Love the 2 for 1 coupons"}
{"text":"Great pub food, nice staff, a lot of British food, clean, haven't gamed there yet but I hear the machines are good, they have a non smoking section."}
{"text":"One of the nicer bars in town. Decent bar food, great drinks, and lots of tvs to watch sports. If you don't mind random waves of rich, 4x4 douche bags, go for it. The bartenders and waitresses are great and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Whether you are a drinker, diner, sports fan, or love to play Golden Tee this is a great place to be. Typically, we will go for dinner, however lately, we have been there to watch sports.   The food is always great. We especially love the Patty Melt and Nachos.  The service has never been bad. Tina, London, Reggie and the rest of the crew remember your names and look out for you. Always checking to make sure that you have everything you need.  The atmosphere is different depending on where you sit and when you come. The lounge area with the comfy couches is a great place to watch the big game.  Make sure you check for the coupons in the Summerlin View for specials and if you are of Irish descent or Irish for a day, you MUST go and enjoy their St. Patty's Day celebration. It is big, bawdy, and full of fun."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It is by far my favorite hang out, and as a local bartender myself I have spent many hours visiting bars all across Vegas. They have the best staff in town along with awesome food and entertainment. Definitely a place to try if your not already a regular!"}
{"text":"I almost hate to write a review because I don't want anyone else to come here :(  I never suggest meeting a guy there because if it doesn't work out, but they like 3AW, it will be RUINED for me -_- It is the best place to go hide after a long day...I try other places but I find I go back here over and over.  Heffeweisen is super cold. Reggie is my favorite bartender in Vegas. I'm surprised that some of the other reviews were not favorable towards the staff, I find them to be mostly awesome, but maybe because they are familiar with me.  However....if there is a party in the couch area, and you don't want to gamble, you can't sit at the bar, so you are pretty much forced to eat at that weird side bar thing and stare at the party that is going on that you werent invited to. It's awkward. Maybe go when there isn't a party.  I only ever get the Cobb salad or steak, hold all sides, double mushrooms. I can't really comment on anything else, as I go to throw them back, not eat."}
{"text":"Played max bet at a decent pace for an hour. Won forty bucks and had two beers and my girlfriend, who was not playing, had one. Got bill expecting to pay for her drinks. My two domestic beers were in the bill too. Didnt comp me for playing."}
{"text":"After being driven out onto the hot mean streets of Boca Park by the outstandingly bad service at Wahoo's Tacos (see previous review) I stumbled into a cool oasis know as Three Angry Wives Pub.  There I met an angel disguised as Debbie the bartender who soothed me with ice cold beer and piping hot pretzel bites.  Once revived and renewed, I was pleasantly surprised by the check -- half price from 2-6pm.  I recommend you go here when you find yourself in a similarly desperate situation."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and ran across this pub. I decided to stop in for a bite to eat. I was really surprised at how reasonable the food was and how good it tasted! The pub has a nice vibe, mostly due to the manager/bartender who is very attentive and genuinely likes his customers.  I would have no problem recommending this pub as I plan on returning myself."}
{"text":"Staff was amazing. Food was ok, lots of options. In the middle of the second quarter of the game we went to watch, the owner wanted to watch something different. We would have spent much more time and money had they not changed the channel. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not to jump to any conclusions, but this is our second time here and the service is still the worse unless you are of a certain skin tone. There were two other tables around us and they were being waited on very attentively while we had to ask for a menu and get ignored while we just sat there.  The table that arrived after us got plate settings, menus, and drinks even though we were there at least 15 minutes before. We paid for our drinks (I had to walk up to the bar to order and pay, while the other tables got served) and went to a real local place that knows service. We gave Three Angry Wives a second chance but unfortunately they failed again."}
{"text":"Great locals pub with bar-top gaming.  The servers and bartenders are the friendliest people in town.  Quick service, GREAT FOOD, and a decent selection of tap beers and spirits.  Seriously, I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews!  I guess the one thing I can say is that their Internet jukebox is a bit wonky..."}
{"text":"This is a regular stop for the Mrs and I in Vegas.  We always go during Happy Hour, with 1/2 priced appetizers and drinks.  We both love the wings - the best in town. If you want a side of fries, I suggest you order them separately (larger amount received that way).  A decent selection of beers.  Can't beat the Happy Hour prices!"}
{"text":"My husband, son, and I went to this place for dinner on 5/23/14.  I ordered the chicken and rib plate ($19) and a hard cider.  I asked for dark meat which shouldn't be a problem since white meat seems to be more popular. The cider and the Caesar side salad were crisp, cold, and delicious. (The reason for upping my review to two stars.)  That's where the positives stop.  After a pretty long wait, the server comes to our table saying, \"I have good news and bad news.  The good news is that your order is ready.  The bad news is that we are out of baked potatoes and it will be over an hour until they're ready.\"  This is an \"Irish\" pub.  I'm thinking that 6:15 on a Friday evening would be a good time to expect a higher demand for baked potatoes.    About ten minutes later, our previously ready and nothing more than warm meal arrived.  The ribs seemed oven-cooked with barbeque sauce poured on just prior to serving.  The vegetables were bland. The chicken was white meat.  When I mentioned this, the server said, \"I asked for dark.\"  No offer to replace it with the correct item.  It was dry and chewy, so I left it unbeaten.    When she brought our check, it had an 18% gratuity already figured into the total.  We are good tippers for good service always figuring it based on the value not the reduced amount when using a coupon. IT is pretty presumptuous to have a tip amount selected and added into the total on the bill.  Based on the nothing special food, less than caring service, and preconceived notion that their customers won't tip without bing required to, Five Angry Wives just lost the business of One Angry Wife."}
{"text":"I met a friend for a quick bite to eat after work.  The service is always so-so in the bar area. We found a high-top table but it took awhile before we were acknowledged for drinks and had to ask for a menu.  We shared the Grilled Greek and chips/salsa.   The chips/salsa came with nacho cheese and home made salsa. The salsa was average and the cheese tasted like a true nacho cheese.  The Grilled Greek came with pita bread, gyro meat, tomatoes, cucumber, artichoke hearts, feta cheese, and tzatziki sauce. The pita bread was soft and warm. The rest of the items were about average in taste.  I'm sure they have better items on the menu but the service needs to improve."}
{"text":"Looked online to contact support regarding my visit. Not available.  Had an issue with my funds available card at atm--asked Derik (on duty  bartender) for assistance-leaving tender assisted me -as derik  did not have interest in my assistance?  I watched him carefully after that-very short with other guests- I then tested him with a question on my gaming question-VERY SHORT with answer-and mind you not busy-as I know what busy is-I was obnoxiously (with intent) looking at him for 'maybe' another question-he did not even look my may?? As a long time bartender- I was quite obviously the next 'in line' to attend to-I then had to wait for the bar back-of which was above and beyond amazing-to ask the bartenders name since he never introduced himself , AS SOON AS HEARD THAT-Derik asked if he could help me with anything? Pahleeez-there are soooo many other applicants that know how attend and proceed with accepted customer relations-this guy DID NOT! I have NEVER posted as such-but this was absolutely unacceptable service in Vegas -in general! I am in hopes that this establishment finds employees with higher standards as there are many out there that would have allowed me the comfort and satisfaction to stay longer and play-he just pissed me off so bad from the start-watch your cameras and see the mood change at his arrival-"}
{"text":"There are plenty of good neighborhood bars in Las Vegas, and this is one of them. My husband and I stopped in for lunch while running errands in the area, and we sure are glad we did.  We sat in the back dining area, and my only complaint is that it was super dark. It was hard to read the menu, and we had no luck at all reading the beer list that was sitting on the table. Good thing Miller Lite is a staple at most bars (like it was here), so we didn't have to ask for a rundown of our choices. (I opted for iced tea, but my husband had a couple of drafts.)  My husband had the fish sandwich, which was really good. Lightly battered cod served with cheese, lettuce, and tomato. I liked my sandwich even better. The corned beef and sub slaw is like a lighter version of a reuben. Although I didn't think I'd like this on a sub roll, the bread was great (nice and chewy), and the corned beef was about the best I've ever had. We both got fries, which were fine, and I had a nice crisp pickle, although they left that off my husband's plate.  Service was good, and the prices were fair. And it looks like they have half-price beers and apps for happy hour, which is a bonus. Although it's a little far from my house, I think I'll be stopping in again when I'm in the area. And maybe next time I'll schedule our errands to coincide with happy hour!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for a little cheat night after a hard week's work.  I'm a huge fan of pretzel bites and these ones did not disappoint.  Pretzel bites tossed with garlic butter and salt, served with cheese sauce ($6.99).  I'm drooling just thinking of these.   I ordered the rodeo burger - onion rings, cheddar cheese, and bbq sauce ($8.99).  Delicious!!  I chose onion rings for my side.  They were soooo good; my boyfriend couldn't keep his paws off of them.  He ordered the \"Get Some\" burger - american cheese, fries, onion straws, jalapenos, and nacho cheese ($9.99) with french fries as his side.  Also good, but not as good as my onion rings.  The bar was packed so we didn't get to sit there, only downside =(  Service was good.  Pretzel bites, two burgers, two beers, and two redbull vodkas came out to around $55, can't remember exactly."}
{"text":"Just stopped by to try this place out and grab a bite and a brew. It was mid afternoon on Saturday so we found a great spot at the bar and jumped into the video poker first.  The bartender suggested we try the cheeseburger chowder and I was glad we did.  It was good, but what's not to like about meat and cheese in a bowl  Next we spilt a salad that was not only large, but delicious.   Some kind of Greek thing with gyro meat, salami, peppercinis, tomatoes.....all good stuff for sure.     Beer were good to, so I figure we will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, good beer, and textbook Americanized Irish pub feel.  If I have to go to Boca Park for happy hour, this is where I usually try to steer the event.  I like the laid back atmosphere and playing a little keno while I sip my Guiness.  Not much else to tell..."}
{"text":"My favorite Happy Hour spot in Summerlin!  Love the staff, the food, the music and the regulars are hilarious to evesdrop on!  Single girls can hang out with bartender backup....no freaks on a leash here!  Did I mention the food?  Happy  hour has half price appetizers!  Greek plate ROCKS!"}
{"text":"We go to T-A-W once a month or so and the food is usually good; wings, burgers and the Irish specialties are very good. However the 'Salmon Special' last Friday was awful. Nice size piece of fish that I ordered grilled. Waaaay over cooked and dried out. It was accompanied with mashed potatoes (instant I'm sure) and frozen broccoli (luke warm). We usually sit at the bar and the bartenders are very efficient and friendly. If we sit in the dining room the servers are friendly and most know the menu. The service in the bar and dining room is good. I guess it depends what time of day you drop in. We'll  go back but i'll not be ordering the fish except for the fish and chips which is outstanding."}
{"text":"They should rename this place 2 Angry Bartenders! We went in on a Friday night, it was so smoky and a quarter full of patrons. Only 2 out of 3 of us were gambling and the bartenders were very upset we had the nerve to sit at their machines. The first big buff blonde man was so rude and walked away before we could even order. The 2nd bartender Briton(?) was more interested in talking about his b'ahi religion than mixing a drink. We put over $60 into the machines, and were going to order food until he started belittling my girlfriend. We asked for the check and were charged for all 3 drinks...when we questioned why we were not comped at least one drink he literally snatched the $20 from my other girlfriends hand and said \" we are done here\" If you like to be treated like crap on a girls night out by rude bartenders in a smoky half empty bar this would be the place for you! So bizarre... as the customer service was a zero. I would give this place zero stars if I could!"}
{"text":"The only reason for four stars rather than five is the smokey atmosphere. The bartenders are all top notch, and I even witnessed probably one of the most classy ways of cutting someone off for having too much to drink (kindly asking if he'd like some water or something else non-alcoholic and its on the house). The reason for the review is the food, huge portions, prepared fast and no problem with asking for extra rolls, butter, etc. Genuinely nice staff and overall atmosphere. I highly recommend if you need food late at night and don't want fast food in the area."}
{"text":"Came to watch Hockey and have a couple drinks....no sound and was told they don't turn it up. It disturbs the gamers. Why bother having the TV's. won't be back"}
{"text":"Excellent! Food is great, drinks are great and it is super affordable! Huge portions of food so don't order too much!"}
{"text":"One in Italian for my fellows  Service is nice. Music is enjoyable.  Nice atmosphere.  Portions are really big and prices are reasonable.  Free wifi is a pleasant surprise especially if you tare on your own"}
{"text":"The entrance has a sign that says the non smoking entrance is on the rear end of the restaurant. So my bf and I walk through this rocky side area with shards of broken glass to get to the \"rear\" side. There are two doors but only one of them has a handle. I opened the door with the handle only to find a surprised and confused kitchen worker telling me that the rear entrance was removed some time ago and that we need to enter through the front....great. So we walk through the rocks and glass again to the entrance. Once we got in, the nonsmoking room was acutally nice and the food itself was decent, we got Mac and cheese bites, shepard's pie, and white wine mussels. They really need to remove that sign at the entrance though. Such an easy fix."}
{"text":"Arrived at 1 on a Friday to avoid the lunch rush. Food was placed in front of me :50 minutes later :( \"Sorry about the wait, all these people (13) had to eat before you.\"  Not true: I was seated before 11 of them.  Ordered the crunchy shrimp wrap (spinach tortilla). Not bad tasting, but the cream cheese (yep) does NOT work. The fat in the cream cheese coats the tongue and blocks the subtle flavors of the shrimp and veggies from coming through. I tasted cream cheese and the green onions. Great mouth feel with the shrimp coating and crispy cuke pieces.  I will go back and try something else.  Low marks for long wait, surliness, and poor recipe development."}
{"text":"This is my \"Cheers.\" Debbie always knows what we order by drink and food! best chicken nachos in town,again,don't miss happy hour,very worthwhile. Never been during St. Pat's cuz it's a nuthouse and I can't deal with that many drunk bastards in one loci. My man loves the wings, the kiddo loves the potato skins, and if I don't get the big ass chicken nachos, it's usually a cold day in hell!!! love this place, we go about every two weeks :)"}
{"text":"Great Happy hour 2-6 M-F 1/2 price beer and apps. Great service from Chad. Found this place while waiting to go to dinner and was so impressed we made a return the next day. Wings are good but pretzel bites even better. Pass on the mac n cheese bites though. Definite stop on the next trip to LV."}
{"text":"Best Bar Food in Vegas.  Draft beers kept perfect. Personal service from guys like Reggie and Eric make this a reliable location for just about anything.  Not a gambler so I can't speak to the play at the bar but the kitchen and bartenders always deliver."}
{"text":"Came here with my roommates for dinner and drinks. Chill spot, good food, and decent prices."}
{"text":"Never eaten there because the place always smells like a bathroom and don't bother playing stuff that you want on the jukebox because the bartender will turn it off until you leave and then once you leave he'll delete all the songs that you put on,sorry for putting in Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson I thought it was a lot better than the rap crap playing. There are so many better bars around to go visit like the Martini down the street or Frank's Tiki Room or the Bar on Durango or......"}
{"text":"Wow! Been sitting here for over an hour waiting for the sandwich I ordered. Still nothing. This is unacceptable! They need more help and new management! Too bad. I will not be back soley due to the food not arriving."}
{"text":"My favorite hang in all Las Vegas.  Stiff drinks, great unpretentious food.  Always have a good time."}
{"text":"Okay here goes. This is very much a dilemma. I love this place. I've been coming here for years, not quite a regular but I go there often. Today it was a shitshow. Don't get me wrong I love the bartenders; I love Debbie I love Reggie today I met the worst bartender ever. Sat at the bar by myself; a woman came and sat next to me to play a machine. She bought me a drink. WHen the bartender brought it over he charged for one because she was playing the machine. A little while later she tried to buy another round of drinks and he charged her for both. She asked why because she was playing machine. He told her that she wasn't playing, that the credits were still the  same as it was. I spoke up and said but she has been playing she hasn't been winning or losing staying pretty much equal his reply this is not a casino. I was kinda shocked, never experienced  that in this establishment before. Then while sitting there a friend of mine showed up so I bought her a drink price $9. A little while later she want another one and purchased it it was only $7. So she question him (same bartender) he said that the bartenders really don't know the prices and a double is $9 in a single a $7. Nobody ordered a double. He may think that we are stupid but we are in the industry.  I would have to say about 80% of the population here in Vegas work in the industry, I know when you punch it in the computer the price is there, so you don't need to be idiot to know the price. Like I said in a dilemma, love this place but extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"We liked it.  The seating is nice. We got a small table along a wall with comfy, deep chairs. Every seat has a great view of the televisions, so if you are there to watch a game you are in luck.  The food selection is pretty standard, but has interesting names and unique names. The beer selection has a lot of room to grow.  We will be back, as I want this place to blow me away. I imagine that a good night here is GREAT!!"}
{"text":"Service kills this place. I love St. Patty's Day here, and the food is typically enjoyable...but they're not very aware of incoming patrons. Myself and a family member sat in the front for 10 minutes with no service, then went to the bar for service and we were immediately scolded by the bartenders - we weren't gambling, so we couldn't sit there...even though there was only 2 or 3 people at the entire damn bar (obviously there's like 20+ seats at the bar). It was the most shocking experience I've ever had at a restaurant/bar...and it's been similar every time I go back. Come to gamble your money away or don't come at all. *To be accurate and fair - this experience was about 6 months ago, just never wrote a review on Yelp until now."}
{"text":"If I can give this place negative stars I would first time ever reviewing a place but this pub is by far the worst place I ever been bartender was extremely rude to us we simply asked to a menu and flat out told us no with no reason why he was say no jus no asked if we can sit at the bar and said no these poker machines are for regulars that supposedly put 1000 into this machine everyday so with all that being said and done we didn't order a drink confronted him and left OWNER OF THIS PUB READ THIS AND TALK TO UR BARTENDER HE WAS A TALL GUY WITH LONG HAIR BIGGEST PIECE OF SHIT IN THW WORLD"}
{"text":"The place is clean and comfortable. The ambiance is casual. However, the service was extremely slow. The bartender was really slow because he was chatting with a lady for a while. The server who later came to our table was also really slow. Lastly, they do not have a drink menu; they only have a beer menu."}
{"text":"At the time of this review no one can deny that the economy is down. People are losing their jobs. No jobs means penny pinching and that means no going out. I can not believe the poor service this 'establishment' offers to customers willing to pay for their overpriced drinks and food.  Service is HORRIBLE  My friend and I intended on going to the bar to get a drink then find a table and order some food. Many of you have done it before, go to the bar, get your drink on, go find some place to lounge.   WE WERE DENIED SERVICE because we weren't playing the video slot machines. We sat for 20 minutes getting stupid looks from the bartenders and rude remarks.  We put money into the machines and were later told that it's not enough to rate service. There's no sign that says there is a minimum amount to be spent to quality as 'playing'. What if that's just my system? What if i put small amounts in at a time because that's my play style? I put a few bucks in and play a few hands and apparently because Jackson didn't go into the machine i'm not really 'playing'. BULL SHIT  How would you like to be corrected? A bartender walks by and rudely says 'cant sit there' or someone coming up and saying, excuse me fellas these seats are reserved for individuals who wish to use the gaming machines, i can get you a drink but we're going to have to relocate you elsewhere.   I flagged down a bartender and three of them came up and said we were being rude. Seriously, is this how you treat PAYING customers? What kind of establishment treats their customers like shit? There are MUCH BETTER ways to address customers.   If it was one person behind the bar giving us a hard time because of a bad day i can understand that. NOT THE WHOLE STAFF.   Another thing. The same individual that said the seats are reserved for game players WAS SITTING EATING HIS LUNCH AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BAR ON A MACHINE SOMEONE COULD HAVE BEEN PLAYING."}
{"text":"Love it here! The food is ALWAYS awesome, beer is cold and staff is amazing! Erin and Kandy are so cute together behind the bar! Laurisa is such a great server, she always knows our drinks and is very attentive! If your in the area you need to check this bar out!"}
{"text":"Nice looking Irish pub in a strip mall. Food was good and the menu has plenty of choices but don't try to sit at the bar unless you're a \"high roller\". The bartender will chase you off. I even told her I was going to put money in the machine but she said it's for regulars.  I just can't bring myself to come back and give them a second chance even though I live a block away.  There are much better choices in the area.  Maybe they should take a look at their average review score and re-evaluate how they run the bar area."}
{"text":"I needed a NE Patriots bar in Vegas, and I found it. Good team spirit and raffles during the game! Go Pats!"}
{"text":"Decent pub for decent food while watching a game. I like how there are multiple areas: a dining room behind glass to avoid gaming noise and smoke, a lounge area with couches to watch the game in comfort, and bar/cocktail table seating for a final option. And of course, the bar has built-in gaming for those who feel so inclined.  Service was okay- our waitress was friendly and checked in on us regularly, seemed to be the only one working a dinner rush on a Thursday which was a bit odd. There was another guy running around clearing tables and greeting people who seemed a little overwhelmed or distracted, and didn't follow up after bringing us our first drinks, but the majority of our service was provided by the waitress- I think her name was Kandi?  Had a BOGO coupon for dinner entrees from a local publication. I went for the grilled chopped and topped greek salad- plentiful portion, surprisingly good pita for a bar, lots of fresh veggies, and  waitress was happy to give me both the greek feta and the bleu cheese dressings on the side to pick and choose which one went best. Only criticism is that there was very little meat on the salad, portion was more similar to bacon topping on a salad rather than a main protein for an entrée. BF opted for the corned beef and cabbage plate, which was also a giant portion, and again, better quality than expected. Sides were a side salad (also fresh), and mashed potatoes, which were super creamy. I kept stealing bites when he wasn't looking (he saw anyway, but the portion was huge so he didn't mind).  Overall this is a place I would return to- but only armed with another BOGO coupon. While quality is better than expected for bar food, prices are considerably higher too. Not a place I expect to drop $50 for dinner for two and two drinks."}
{"text":"Just wanted to have a beer and relax, met at the bar by a bartender with an attitude and no customers service skills, 40 something, white male, bb cap. Immediately relocated to lounge area and met a waitress who helped us. Not returning. ..."}
{"text":"Some friends suggested this spot after our adventure hunt we had all day. We need to chill and have a drink.  Once you walk in its soo cozy, if you don't want to sit at the bar they have some SUPER comfortable couches facing multiple tv's with sports playing. Maybe they felt really comfy cause we just finished a scavenger hunt in the city and we were dead.  I just had one beer a smithwicks ale. I will admit I was babysitting my drink but the whole time we were there my drink stayed COLD! The waitress was very attentive and kept coming to check on us. She kept making fun of my hubby cause he got a water bahaha. I wasn't really hungry so I didn't order any food. I do want to come back cause my friends and hubby said their beer battered fries are the best. What I'm really impressed with is the bathroom. Now once you walk in the Lassie's restroom there's nothing too special. But when I finish washing my hands I also keep my paper towel so I don't touch the handle with clean hands. BUT then I saw this sign and it says to place your foot on a metal plate below and you use your foot to slide the door open! See the pictures I posted! I'm such a germaphob I know but every bathroom should have this!!"}
{"text":"Always excellent service. The bartenders are great and the food is actually really delicious, everything tastes really fresh and they have a lot to chose from on their menu. They also serve food 24/7 which is great also bc not a lot of places in Summerlin do. You can go in or order on Uber eats. Zack is my favorite bartender, so sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a quiet Tuesday afternoon to enoy happy hour.  Excellent service, decent bar food, and great prices!!  Love the comfy couches for lounging!!  See you again soon!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been regulars here for many years. The food and drinks are always consistent. Especially if you're craving bar food. The only down side is that the prices have gone up over the years. Even though it's a little pricey it's our fall back eatery."}
{"text":"I went to this  establishment Monday August 11,2014 for dinner.  I ordered their meat loaf.   I was very sick after eating their food.   I would not eat at this restaurant ever again!"}
{"text":"So, we went to the St. Patrick's Day event at 3 Angry Wives. (For some reason, I keep wanting to call it Fourth of July, I don't know what's up with that).  I don't know what I expected, but I was a bit underwhelmed. $10 entry for what?  For a few outside tables/chairs, some beer vendors (just regular stuff), and a band that would play one song, stop for 20 minutes, play another song, and so on and so forth?  I think I'd rather buy a $10 burger- at least I'd get some satisfaction from that.  It was cool enough seeing all of the people dressed in green, but that's about it.  I don't know that I'm inspired to return for a meal."}
{"text":"Overall, this place is great.  However, every once in awhile, there are some patrons that come there that are screaming and yelling and partying in a bar that is more of a chill place.  They have a great St Patty's Day celebration and know how to throw a party, but they also know how to have the cool, lounge type of bar atmosphere which I like.  I usually go in there on Sundays and its a great place to hang with friends, eat some good grub and have a beer.  I go there to do homework since I need the white noise to make me concentrate and its great.  Lots of TVs, video poker, a few arcade games and the staff is super friendly.  If you're looking for a cool pub to hang with some friends and enjoy a few beers, this is definitely the place for you.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This bar is great... that is, if you're an attractive woman under the age of 30 or you can bench over 350lbs.  Seriously, if you don't fit this criteria, you will be ignored by the steriod infused bartenders.  This is a serious flaw and the owner needs to take a hard look at it.  There are fairly heavy gamblers like myself that will be completely turned off by the non-existent customer service.  There's one more criteria that will get you a drink, if you're a female employee.  For example, I was at the bar, gambling the max amount every hit.  Both wannabe jock bartenders looked at my empty beer at least three times each as they checked in with the female employee three seats down on every pass.  I don't even think she was gambling.  This is outrageous.  I spent a few hundred dollars and had to ask them every time for another beer.    The other issue is there are virtually no comps for gamblers (unless of course you meet the aforementioned criteria).  You have to go out of your way to get a free beer, no free food and I literally only racked up $3 in free machine play after betting the max at a fast rate for over two hours.    To the owner... your team needs to focus less on comparing MMA stories, less on trying to get in the female employees pants, less on trying to appear like a tough guy, and more on basic customer service.  Never walk by a gambling customer, look at his empty beer and ignore it.  Gamblers are your bread and butter, not showing off that you've doubled your dose of steriods."}
{"text":"We visit TAW at least once a week since it's right in our neighborhood.  We always have great service and we have our favorite food too.  My boyfriend loves the Dugan's Skinny appetizer which is fresh veggies and spinich dip.  The nachos are HUGE and very good.  I also recommend the sliders and the rosemary roast beef dip!  So yummy!"}
{"text":"On a quick trip to Vegas, three of us opted to forgo the $11 half-hearted pours of mixed drinks at the Mirage, and drove to The Summerlin area up North to get some local flavor.  Three Angry Wives Irish Pub caught our eye, just on the name alone. We walked in and it took a few minutes for our eyes to adjust to the dim lit room...which was great. The atmosphere was great.  We forgot about Vegas still allowing smoking in their bars, and there were plenty of smokers and cigar smokers drinking and playing games, but the air system made it very comfortable...in fact, it wasn't really noticeable after a while (great job).  The service was great...very friendly, and energetic. Our server told us it was happy hour and appetizers were 1/2 off. We had to try the chicken nachos...$4.99.  Every head in the place turned as the over-sized mountain of melted mexican munchies were delivered to our table. And the three of us weren't sure if we could finish the foothill-sized plate of flavor...so the back up plan would be to climb them and repel down the other side just to work off the calories.  Even a local diner came over and commented on the huge portion...as she snapped off a picture. They were not only plentiful, but delicious. They should come served with a velvet rope and stanchions to keep the onlookers at bay and crowds of gawkers orderly. A must order!  I can't say enough about the frosty cool beverages, the atmosphere and the service. These nachos will soon be a must-see attraction in Vegas, right up there with the Bellagio Fountains."}
{"text":"Two more angry customers.  The cigar-smoking, loud-mouthed and despicable Notre Dame football fan who I presume is the owner of this bar was unbelievably inhospitable to me and Misti Y. in the following ways:  1. Blowing plumes of cigar smoke in our general direction when he saw that we weren't cheering for his team, but instead for Michigan in a concurrent game. 2. Changing the channel on the TV directly in front of us from the Michigan-Nebraska game we were watching to the blowout game between Texas A&M and Auburn without warning, care or apology. 3. Demanding that his server turn up the volume of the Notre Dame game to ear-popping levels - no less than 105-110 decibels. \"I am tired of having this conversation with you - turn up the volume!\" we heard him say impatiently to one of the servers. 4. Constantly screaming at the top of his lungs at the TV screen in reaction to every single tackle or positive play while maintaining a distance of no more than 5 feet away from us.  We were literally smoked out, tuned out, drowned out, and screamed out. Never before have we experienced such persecution at a bar.  For the record, this was our 5th visit to Three Angry Wives for food and drink, but our first encounter with the 'owner'. It was certainly our last visit, as it is clear that customers will always take a backseat to the owner's desires. Avoid this bar (especially on College Football Saturdays) and especially if the owner is present. Your experience will be ruined, yet all stereotypes of obnoxious Notre Dame fans will be confirmed and fully verified.  There are dozens of other bars in the area who deserve your business more."}
{"text":"10:30 pm, Monday ordered online to go...Hawaiian pizza and Rosemary Dip, both cost $11 each;   The Rosemary Dip was very good, served hot with lotsa roast beef and Swiss cheese with carmelized onion on a chibatta roll and Rosemary au jus for dipping.   The pizza, a different reaction...Compare to Taco Bell's 'pizza', this pizza is the same size and is accompanied by a salad; the salad is romaine lettuce, some croutons and a hint of shredded cheese with your choice of dressing (I chose the Caesars salad). The pizza is heavy with cheese, hiding the other ingredients..lotsa marinara sauce with pineapple chunks and cubed, thin sliced breakfast ham.   First experience and a bit surprised, happy with the sandwich but disappointed with the soggy pizza...smh"}
{"text":"It not often come too the Wives but have been here before for St Patricks Day is pretty nuts. I have always been a big fan of Irish Pubs and St Patricks Day become yearly tradition with hockey family. When in Irish Pub nothing better then Guinness or black and tan. I find its hit or miss comes too Guinness if not at Irish Pub. Not many people that drink it so if tap not running lot it really does affect the taste. One of the reasons enjoy my Guinness at Irish Pubs. I meet the hockey family for friends birthday party. So review not about the food. It cool small bar that great place too meet up with friends for some drinking, conversations, and good times. They do have one of those tables that can pour your own draft beers. I never ordered it so not sure the way it works. Sorry. It has lots of televisions all over for sports and one section that mini sports book on football weekends. It Notre Dame bar not that too obvious. Dah! So if fan for sure this is place you want too be. It does have none smoking (think none smoking dining section; only times come here is too drink with friends) or dining area separate from the bar area. I like the Wives and great place go drinking with friends."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend come to this bar a lot, but I just know about the food because I'm not 21 yet. We always sit in a booth in the restaurant section (which are really comfortable BTW) and it's one of my favorite spots. It's never too busy (although I've only gone at night) so I can relax and eat and I really enjoy it. The waitresses are always very friendly and accommodating and I haven't had a bad experience yet. All the food i've had there has always been delicious and filling. My mom makes better beef and cabbage, but I would expect I'd think that about any place because I am biased. Lol. For someone that isn't my mom, their beef and cabbage was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"My wife eat the cod sandwich, with a side of potato salad and the baked potato with mushrooms I asked her the next day what did you think of three Angry wives pub and she said AMAZING!! I had the Braveheart sandwich with au jus and a side of onion rings and side salad, the side salad and was enough for two so that was nice, the sandwich was good I felt that it needed more salt but it was good no question about it I would recommend to others and I will certainly bring eating here again!!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great and the food was good but we went in their with a buy one get one free with my mom who is on a fixed income and my son who is a tbi survivor .. needless to say we took the coupon for a reason..when we got the bull there was a 6.74 charge for using the coupon well the meal was only 8.00 do what exactly did we save? Where's the\"get one free\" it's a coupon scam!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in after a long day of work just for a quick bite to eat and a cold beer. It was Weds night so I am guessing it was a slower night but I loved it! Good ALT music was playing and I got to relax here and not deal with people. The draft beer is tasty and I got the steak sandwich which was super yum.  Will be here again to try other items off the menu!"}
{"text":"Always great food and fun.  Shannon is always helpful and the patrons are friendly. If only I can figure how how to win some money.  Definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely HORRIBLE!!!! Waited 15 minutes before was told the bar are was open seating. Then waited another 15  minutes just to place our food order and then the waitress didn't even listen to what was ordered and had to repeat. Waitress was rude and didn't seem to care. Don't think I'll return regardless of how good the food is."}
{"text":"Three Angry Wives is not only a great name for an Irish Pub, but an all-around solid Irish Pub.  They have plenty of standard Irish fare plus a good selection of normal bar and grill food.  I am a fan of the chicken cobbler ciabatta.    3 Angry has a great happy hour from 2pm - 6pm  And on a personal note this is where I first fell in love with Smithwick's... completing my affinity for the Holy Trinity of Irish beer!  I have since moved on in beer tastes but there is something beautifully nostalgic about pints of Guinness, Harp and Smithwick's for me at 3 Angry.  They have several big screens if you want to watch the game....and a separate restaurant side that is considerably quieter if you want dinner without the bar feel."}
{"text":"I like the couch area and the pub atmosphere but I didn't appreciate the huge additional \"hold\" amount that the establishment added onto my debit card.  We're talking at least $30!   This hits a special nerve with me because on another occasion in a different location I used an account that was practically empty and this caused me to overdraw on that account and get charged numerous overage fees.  I think this practice is complete crap and the restaurant should warn the individual since this kind of thing can end up costing a person a pretty penny.  Luckily I had money in my account this time, but imagine my surprise to see an extra $40 tacked onto my bill when I looked at my debit account online.  When I called I was told to check back in a week and if it's still there to contact them then.  Not cool."}
{"text":"I've been nothing but polite to ANYONE in this establishment. So on my 6th visit in the 2 months since I've moved here, I hear while trying to eat and enjoy my drinks the manager of the Bar gossiping about a new girl who just started. I've tipped this same manager quite well in the previous visit (literally yesterday) and even tolerated an extra $43.00 charge from the pats game last Sunday, which I had to dispute with my bank from this establishment in order to get my money back, on my card. The manager in question gossiped with another co-worker about the girl in training all because she didn't want to go behind the G.M to deposit the silverware.  She literally spoke about her like a dog. I had my headphones in, they probably thought I couldn't hear, but they spoke about the new girl like an animal. I've never seen such unprofessionalism. The dirty silverware deposit wasn't exactly behind him, but it shows how rude they can be here to customers or coworkers. I was told to never come back AFTER i've spent and tipped well. Shows how you treat certain types of folks! Don't bother with this establishment! They clearly don't know customer service!  and are unwilling to accept that their customers don't want to hear employee gossip even st shift change! I could be a professional critic but I guess the GM will never know until the future."}
{"text":"Great food, SHIT service  For a $36 ubereats order you'd think they'd give you everything you pay for instead of what they want to give you anyway. Why give the option for ranch, then take my money for extra on the side and just not include it? Too lazy to look at the ticket? I work in the service industry and I understand that mistakes happen. But for a $30 order you can check it twice."}
{"text":"The happy hour deals here are really good - half off all beers and most appetizers. There were a lot of beers to choose from, draft, bottles and cans. The food was great, and we got good service. The shepherd's pie and mac and cheese bites were amazing.   I liked that the non smoking section was completely separate than the smoking section so we didn't smell any smoke."}
{"text":"We had a going away part here last night, and even if we weren't leaving the state, wouldn't go back. We brought a lot of business and our server refused to split our check, so we were having to go up to the bar to purchase (not cheap) drinks, where the bartender was so busy looking at his cell phone he couldn't pay attention to the fact that we were trying to order, and was rude once we actually got his attention. Service - poor. Food - ok, needless to say we ended up taking the party somewhere else."}
{"text":"The best Irish Pub in town, good service, GREAT food, and fun atmosphere.  Order the Wexford Wings!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my time here. The staff were awesome, always on top of refills and making sure everything was ok. Plenty of beer choices, food was excellent.. The atmosphere was pretty cool, a lot of tv's, seating, and good people laughing. I would definitely come back. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Food was good. We had a coupon. Bill showed the coupon deducted. Because of the coupon, the tip was added. 30% is an excessive tip. Service was good - but not a 30% tip good. Left us with a feeling of being \"taken\" because we are seniors on a fixed income."}
{"text":"Came here for St. Patrick's day festivities. Green BEer was a flowing but not for me. Guinness and Bass for me and homies. For dinner I had the Corned Beef sandwich on rye with extra 1000.  The rye I am sure came from local LV bakers Great Buns and was delicious.  The Corned Beef was perfectly sliced and cooked perfect. Decent portion on the sammie.  The French fries on the side were extremely hot and fresh.  Had to ask for napkins, silverware,  beer refills,  and check.  But the sammie was awesome."}
{"text":"It was whatever...service was whatever...i got the classy pig which is basically a pulled pork sandwich and it was gross and disapointing. My boyfriends chicken fried steak sandwich was better then mine but he says the meat was tough. Happy hour was an okay deal, i doubt ill be back."}
{"text":"I wish I had a bar just like this in my hometown.   Very comfortable couches and tables to kick your feet up on. I didn't get any food, but I was pretty impressed with what was on the menu. I should have come here for dinner.   The beer selection is a little disappointing though, just your general american brews. Bud, Coors, PBR, Wyders, Blue Moon etc. The atmosphere definitely makes up for their lack of selection.  The staff was very friendly, and let you relax. We had taken over one of the couches and a few chairs, and the staff would come around and check on us at just the right times.   We liked it so much, we bought shirts and glasses so we could remember the great time we had.  I will definitely go back here on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"From 8/14/16 Stopped into Three Angry Wives for a bite to eat before going to Targét. Located in Boca Park, Three Angry Wives, is a cool pub with a big selection of food and booze of course, because of whats a pub without alcohol.  I ordered a burger wrap, not bad. Our service was decent and quick, maybe because it was kind of slow that night. I would come back again to try some of the other foods the have on their menu"}
{"text":"Fun pub to watch a game. Staff is super nice. It gets pretty packed during the Pat's games."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a horrid time at this bar. When we sat a server came by and asked what we wanted I ordered a beer my friend was in the restroom and my other friend tried to ask for the wine list but the server said she would be right back. When my friend came back from the restroom she went to the bar to order a drink and was told she could not as she was at a table. After waiting several minutes and no server returning my other female friend went to the bar the bartender was taking shots with a customer at the bar. My friend ordered two drinks and paid for all our drinks. About 30 minutes later the server came back and asked if we needed anything else and brought our check. My female friend took the check to the bartender and told him I believe this bill has already been paid. He gave the bill to another server said this has already been paid, then he looked at my female friend and said now get the f*** out.  We immediately left."}
{"text":"first of all the waitress was soon rude to us when we questioned why we were charged for a SLICE of onion for our sandwich!!!!!!! the cook came out and said they had a right to make a profit!!!!!  there were four of us at 2pm  the only ones there!!!!!Lets you know how great the place is!!!!  food was... ok not great...the cook said there was cheese on our pastrami  sandwich.  not so... we couldn't see or find it!!!!we felt totally disrespected and will not go there again!!!! they r right...  .. angry people work there!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Well.........   I would have to say that the food was pretty good (breakfast), but the service was definitely lacking.  Seems like the bartender has probably be there for years and is burned out. Not friendly or welcoming at all.  She did talk to the 'regulars'.  Not sure if we would come back for breakfast.  I don't really like being locks away in the dining room, I would rather be put in the open area, but I don't want to have to tip here again :(."}
{"text":"This place is called three angry wives and I ran into an angry bartender, I asked where the restroom was and he said look at the signs and then proceeded to badmouth me to my girlfriend about how stupid I was for not seeing the signs, he was completely unfriendly and I just wanted to leave, I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible in the dining area. I can see why they add 18% tip to check. Food was horrific."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Thanks to a wonderful coupon while visiting Las Vegas we made our way over to this great restaurant.  There is also a pub on the other side, but the restaurant part is divided by glass and wood so there are no odors or loud noises coming from the bar.  I really love Chicken fried Chicken so I ordered that, and my husband was tired of fast food and ordered a Cobb Salad.  Both of us spent the next 45 minutes in Heaven!  The Chicken came with mashed potatoes, gravy and my choice of soup of salad.  I enjoyed a vegetable soup while waiting for my chicken, and when it arrived I was so happy to see it was just the right thickness and fried to a crispy brown.  Everything we had that night was absolutely delicious!  We were so glad we tried it because we've found a \"go-to\" restaurant in Vegas.  We had absolutely no complaints about anything."}
{"text":"Three Angry Wives is a fun little neighborhood bar/pub that has some games, decent food & plenty of TV's.  One really cool part of the bar area is a lounge section with couch style seating and darker lighting.  I didn't sit there but it seemed perfect for a couple on a date or even a group to watch a game on one of their many tv's.    As for the food I had only the Buffalo wings which i found to be tasty and meaty, nothing exemplary, but what I expected.  I ordered it with fries and it came to be just under 10 bucks which isnt outrageous either.  They have a decent selection of beer but not what I expected being an \"Irish\" style pub.  Service was cheerful but slow...so Im willing to overlook that.  There are better neighborhood 24 hr gaming pubs in Vegas, but 3 Angry Wives is more than fine if your close and looking for a cold one. Next time I will definitely have to go during their happy hour because they offer half priced appetizers and beer.  How did they know the way to my heart?"}
{"text":"Was there about 6 months ago for lunch with a co-worker who goes there a lot, The food was okay but certainly nothing to write home about,   Went back there last Wednesday, working with the same co-worker and noticed a chicken fried steak sandwich on the menu, so I ordered it. It's served on grilled sourdough, with cheddar cheese, bacon, tomato, lettuce and ranch dressing. It was the bomb, the best sandwich I have had in a long time, and I eat out every work day.  So glad I gave the place a second chance, will go back often, if for no other reason than the chicken fried steak sandwich.   No smoking in restaurant, smoking in the bar."}
{"text":"Thought this was an Irish bar.... Loud obnoxious rap music... Very disappointed! Overpriced and rude people."}
{"text":"The food was tasty but the service was ridiculously bad. I cannot emphasize how poor the service was. I used to like this place. I'll never go there again.  If you enjoy being ignored this is the place for you. If you like and expect good service and are willing to pay for it, go somewhere else. BJs and Yard House have them beat a 100 times over. Don't go to 3 angry."}
{"text":"It's was good bar food I got a wrap ... I thought it was dumb they charged me for ranch lol but the waitress was really great cool place ... Kids can go too there's a dining area"}
{"text":"Kicked me out for wearing a wife beater! I'm glad I don't live on this side of town, fuckin snobs"}
{"text":"Food is so good I day dream about the menu. The pastrami sandwich is delicious and the fish and chips are tasty as well. Make sure to hit up the happy hour. Nachos are killer and the sampler is good too. I don't even want to mention the soups because it makes my mouth WATER just thinking about it. The mushroom bisque is bomb. The service is good...some nights it can take the servers awhile to come back and check on you..but when you have good drinks, food, and company the last thing you want is someone interrupting 24/7."}
{"text":"The food is good, and it was a nice quiet dinner with my mom"}
{"text":"I have visited this bar on several occasions and have never had horrible service. I usually go in to eat so my review is based on the food and the service. Best places to sit for food:  1. Dining Room (when it is open) I am not sure when they close it but it's probably some time after dinner. They have booths and tables and it is usually self seating. Occasionally it is too busy so they will take names down and put you on a wait. I have never had to wait longer than 10-15 minutes.   2. Bar top I only sit here when the dining room is closed and the bar is relatively empty. (Try not to sit here, especially by video poker machines, especially when it is busy.) I feel I get the best service here when the dining room is closed, but I would never sit here and order food on a busy night, unless I am drinking and/or gambling as well. Since the bartender is readily available it is good service.  3. High top I don't usually like high tops since I feel it sometimes isn't enough space. Cocktail servers usually take care of this section. I guess on slow nights when there isn't a cocktail server the bartender will take over.   Food is always good. The best appetizers I have had are the spinach dip and the white mussels. The spinach dip is incredibly smooth and delicious, and comes with a side of garlic bread and chips. I usually skip the chips and order double bread, The mussels also come with some sort of garlic bread, which to me is salty, but ends up pairing well with the mussels. Their fries are amazing. Deliciously crispy without being burned. They charge for sides of ranch, but this isn't a dock, it's just a comment. I only know because I love ranch... especially with my fries.  The only complaint I have is that no matter where I sit I feel like I wait an unnecessary amount of time for refills."}
{"text":"Ugh. I've ordered food from here before on uber eats (twice last year, last time in august) and it was pretty decent. I'm not sure what changed but my dinner tonight was ridiculous. Pitiful shaved deli meat for corned beef, barely any cabbage and microwaved potatoes for 16 dollars?! The pretzel bites that used to be substantial are now a few frozen pretzel bites I could buy at Smiths for 2.99. What a waste of my money."}
{"text":"Went in for some lunch with some friends. We were ordering the weirdest drinks under the sun... sidecar, grasshopper, mexican coffee, mai tai.... the bartender was this nice blonde lady working in the middle of the day and she knew how to make every weird thing we ordered. not only did she know how to make all the drinks but they all tasted amazing!! she really knew her stuff and tolerated us and our odd request. Also the food was great!"}
{"text":"One of our go-to bars in Summerlin. Three Angry Wives is an Irish bar located next to Starbucks in Boca Park. With Guiness on tap and some of the best chicken fingers Ive ever had, its impossible to not love this place.  The atmosphere is a dimmed, intimate gaming bar. The bartenders are always pleasant, and accommodating. Its exactly what you would expect a neighborhood bar to be."}
{"text":"Good ol' Three Angry Wives! Always reliable, rarely disappointing. The Wives has always reminded me of the Winchester in the movie Shaun of the Dead. So in the event of a zombie apocalypse, feel free to meet me at the Wives while we can have a nice cold pint and wait for everything to blow over.  This dimly lit bar/restaurant adorned with numerous TVs is a great spot to go watch a hockey or football game if you don't mind being around a little bit of cigarette smoke. Some of the cool features this bar boasts include a self-service beer tap system built into a couple of the tables, Golden Tee golf video game, separated bar/restaurant/lounge areas, and a TouchTunes music sound system. If you end up doing a little too much day drinking at the Wives, conveniently located next door is a vitamin shop where I am certain you could try to drunkenly stammer out your request for some hangover prevention goodies.  The bar food here is top-notch. I have had the Reuben sandwich served with fries and a pickle, pretzel bites with cheese and mustard, and the nachos. The Reuben was spot on in terms of quality of corned beef and sauerkraut and portion size on the bread. The pretzel bites are one of those appetizer items you order that you simply can't keep your hands off, and before you know it you are reaching for another bite only to discover you had sadly already eaten the last one! The nachos came with the standard fixin's and were rather mediocre.  The beer selection at the Wives isn't bad at all. I believe they have around 12 beers on tap, plenty of bottled beer, and of course a full bar in terms of liquor for any number of various mixed drinks. The bartenders mixing up these drinks are very attentive, fast, and friendly. I wish the same could be said for the waitresses, as this was sadly the only problem I had with the Wives."}
{"text":"Came here last night after work with my sister, I have got to say that I really like it! The space is big! The food is good, the drinks are even better, and the price is not bad! Would definitely come back over and over again!"}
{"text":"Came into watch the nba finals.... Sadly it took everything to get them to turn on the volume.... More people came in to watch the game.... Then when the sound didn't come on 8 customers that were drinking and eating got up and left.... This management teams needs a significant overall.... Know of any good sports bar with sound?.... Clearly not here.... Omg this is crazy"}
{"text":"This is no ordinary pub food. They have a separate dining room                                                              . The food is wholesome. The menu is plentiful. No greasy spoon here. They accommodated me with steamed veggies. All dishes were super delicious and reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm still getting used to these divey bars/joints being in strip malls. What's cool is that it does fell like a cool, divey pub/bar. However, it's next to a nail salon across the parking lot of Target. And you know it hasn't been there more than 20 years TOPS!  Ok, so that's the worst of it.  Service was GREAT! She was fun, funny w/o interfering or interjecting too much. She was on top of getting refills. The Bartender was quick and polite delivering the brews. Overall it was a great experience for sure! We are in the bar area, and we still had a great experience. Now, if you don't want to deal with smoke, I noticed that they had a glass closed off dining area adjacent to the bar and on the other side was the continuation of the dining area that wouldn't be affected by smokers. Definitely a great spot for some pub food, some beers, some sports and some just hanging out."}
{"text":"Slow service, service staff just kept walking by after they brought out water for our party. They didn't even come by to take our order until we had been sitting there for about 15 minutes. The waitress finally took our order and when the food came out we were happy that they didn't screw it up. All of our selections (Cajun Chicken, Meatloaf & Sliders) were delicious. (Even though they charged us extra for a side of freaking ranch) Overall, they get a C from me. Maybe I'll come back during happy hour and sit at the bar."}
{"text":"It understandable to feel a little apprehensive, especially if you are walking into a bar called Three Angry Wives all by your self. My first visit didn't go over so well, but it may have something to do with my fear of actually running into 3 pissed off Irish girls at once. But the place is real close by, so it was hard to stay away from.  I have made many visits to three Angry Wives since then, with each time getting better than the last. I wasn't sure I was ready to review it until last week's breakfast.  I had eaten from their menu before, but this was my first foray into the breakfast side. I ordered the hash and eggs. Mmm, mmm, good! The corned beef hash was delicious - and separated from the hash browns, so I could be allowed to choose my level of mixture.   The eggs were done perfectly and the presentation, with these little wedges of tomato and cucumber were, well, just more than I would have ever expected from a bar.  I have yet to meet anyone here who even sparked of anger, much less the women who provide the bar's namesake - and I'm just fine with that (well, maybe if they come one-at-a-time).   I will keep coming back to this little gem, especially for another morning bite-to-eat."}
{"text":"First time here on the weekend, service was great actually the bartenders where friendly and good prices on a good selection of beers. The bar wasn't very busy so its definitely low key so its nice to just chill and have a drink...don't know why but the hip hop playing was a little weird im just not used to that in Irish pubs but overall a cool place. I've had the food previously and they have a great fish and chips sandwich."}
{"text":"We love this place and have been going for several years. Even with a newborn. My daughter who is now 3, loves it here too. Service is great and the staff is super friendly. The food is also really good. We love going for breakfast with the $10 off coupon they offer. The beer selection is great. Just love it. My husband likes going himself to sit in the bar area as well."}
{"text":"Waitress completely forgot us and we sat several minutes and not one person took our order. This is extremely rude and insulting.   We will not return and will tell other locals of this negative experience.   Oh yeah hardly an Irish item on the menu. Gimme a break!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer while waiting for a friend.  I think the bartender was having a bad day so I'll cut him some slack.  Mid-week and not even 5pm and very smokey with only a handful of customers.  Seniors were coming in to eat the the enclosed dining room.  The few people at the bar all seemed to be regulars except me.  I might go back and see if they can make respectable fish and chips but will probably have to go into the dining area since the ventilation needs some work."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a few beers here while waiting for our reservation at Melting Pot next door. Place was nice, staff was friendly, beers were good. Kind of loud, but thats because it was Saturday, and football games were on. I would probably hang out at a place like this if it wasnt totally on the other side of town for me."}
{"text":"This place is ok but watch out for the wannabe in the fake dreadlocks. He will ruin your night. Make sure you are not winning at the machines or he will not comp your drinks. Maybe it's time for Marley to get a new job."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Exactly what I expect out of a pub.  Good food great prices, fast and friendly service, by people that remember you."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My husband won't usually go more than 2 miles from our house for food but that was before I brought him here!  Great happy hour plus awesome variety on the menu along with some of the best fries in the city!  We haven't been for breakfast so will have to try that soon!  Check the weekly paper for 2 for 1 coupons!!"}
{"text":"came here for some late night grub with a friend. it was pretty crowded at 12am for a thursday night. we shared an order of nachos and a pulled pork sandwich. both were really good. they also serve one of my fav drinks here...black velvets (half guiness, half pear cider). this place deserves 4 stars just for those alone! i also love that its easy to walk to from my place. oh and the bartender was super cute. i'll be back. =)"}
{"text":"This establishment is the only reason I have a nutritional intake.  The Food is so freaking good not to mention the staff are friendly, welcoming and down to earth.  The food always comes out fresh and fast cooked to perfection. Lets not forget the bartenders.  They make the most awesome drinks.  The setting is comfortable wether you want to sit at the bar and play the awesome electronic poker games, or plop down and watch the many flat screen TV's playing all the different sports.  Three Angry Wives is more then a sport bar.  Its a Irish  pub.  Lets not forget about the food.  Wether its breakfast, lunch or dinner or just eating to sober. This place is a hidden jewel of the Boca Park area of Summerlin. The folks at Three Angry Wives always make sure your food comes out hot fresh and delicious and that wouldn't happen if it wasn't for the awesome cooks working their asses off making sure everything taste superb. If you don't feel like eating in the bar or sports lounge you can sit in a quit restaurant sit down eatery.  One last thing make sure you tip you server, bartender very well. They deserve to be tipped for their serves"}
{"text":"We went w/ a 2-fer coupon & had fish & chips. It was expensive (even with the coupon) and nothing special. The service wasn't great either. It's worth the trip cross town to go to the Crown & Anchor!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was pleasent. I think the server was new but she was fine. I had a Harp, a Newcastle and their Cuban. My first beer just tasted...off. I couldn't figure it out. Then I got a second beer and I felt like I was drinking Newcastle light or something. I think they water down their draft beer. Either that or the keg isn't working because it was flat and tasted off.   Their 'cuban' is more like a ham and turkey cold cut sandwich. Not a Cuban. Not pressed, meat isn't seasoned, no sauce or flavor,  they didn't even put mustard on it. Pretty sub-par. Not comin back to this place."}
{"text":"Came here to watch football and drink beer and eat.  Sat at the bar, Service was great and Erin the bar tender was awesome until we asked to put on the Alamo bowl game on the speakers, Said he didn't want to hear it. Guess he would rather listen to 80s music instead. Don't come here if you want to hear any of the games. Otherwise food was great. Needless to say but I left to Goto another bar that I could listen to the Alamo bowl and watch it."}
{"text":"Just don't bother. Went here on a Friday. Place was busy, but isn't every place?  Got seated at 5:40, server took our order at 6:03 and we got our food at 6:25. She never came back to ask if we wanted more beer, never came back to ask how our food was. I had to flag her down to get our check because we had to be out of there at 6:30 to meet some other friends.  Funny how people who got there way later than us came and went. Food was good, but a lot of places have good food and great service."}
{"text":"We walked in two angry wives and left two happy wives.  My girl Jesse is moving away so we have been making the rounds.  Came in late on a weekday and was greeted by a nice bartender.  I don't know how the conversation started but I was feeling nostalgic and asked him if he could make a watermelon shot.  He whipped one up and down the hatch it went and I was feeling like I was back in college on bar row. The best thing?  Courtesy shot!  That's right , it was on the house!    I told my husband later that stuff like this always happens when I'm out with the girls.  Free drinks, free cover, free appetizers.  Las Vegas treats ladies like royalty!  BTW:  Love celeb gossip and learned Nicolas Cage was here a few weeks ago!  So lots of extra stars just for the coolness factor."}
{"text":"While this place has a sectioned off area for the smoking, bar space, and a restaurant area, unlike many of the places in Vegas they do not give you two bills at the end of the night (one for food and one for drinks), which I'm a fan of.  The food is standard bar food, though they do have wrap versions of various burgers. You would think these would be better for you, but they are just as greasy and fattening as a regular burger, only without the bread bun to absorb the grease.  The crowd is always a mix of 21's to 40's and the staff is always nice and helpful with getting you intoxicated."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the service was AWFUL. We weren't even addressed when we walked in, until someone finally (as in 5 minutes later) acknowledged our existence and told us to seat ourselves. We did, and then about ten minutes later the waitress finally came up and very rudely told us that we were supposed to wait to be seated. We explained the situation, to which she just replied \"Oh.\" And walked off and didn't come back to check on us for about another ten minutes. Not only that, but the service was ridiculously slow for the rest of the night. She only came back and checked on us like once. Had a terrible attitude the entire time. Will probably never be coming back."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  If you're gaming they don't comp drinks.  My fiancé put in $100 on her machine and I put in $40.  We both played a lot but neither of us lost money.  The food was so-so but when the bill came they charged us for 2 two beers we ordered even though we were consistently gaming.  That pissed me off, every other place around town comps your beverages if you're playing.  I would not go back nor would I recommend this place to anyone else.  The prices are high for ok quality and they are obviously cheapskates."}
{"text":"Have been coming to Three Angry for a few years now .. and up until recently had only visited in the late night / early morning hours after work. Boy have I been missing out!!!   I didn't realize in my post work, wine-drinking stupor that they have what is probably the best breakfast menus around. First off .. I have to say that I have a HUGE sweet tooth & LOVE french toast! Three Angry Wives offers not one, not two, but FIVE different versions of french toast! My fave is the Reeses French Toast which combines Peanut Butter Captain Crunch, peanut butter, and hot fudge. The toast is nice and thick and the portions are huge! Some other notable items are the Pretzel Bites with Cheese sauce .. so yummy! And the Cajun Chicken which has just the right amount of spice.  Service was great, and the ambiance relaxed and comfortable. There are signs around the bar-top to let guests know that the seats in front of the video poker machines are reserved for gamblers, which, if you like to play .. you'll appreciate :)"}
{"text":"This place is average at best.  The ambience is good for watching games and as a social Hang.  Their prices are too expensive for anything I ordered.  Below average food, under poured drinks.  When your a vegas local in hospitality you don't wan to feel like your getting ripped off for drinks and cheap food."}
{"text":"Excellent little pub off the strip, which means you can get 2 pints, 2 full meals, an appetizer, and tip (as opposed to a couple watered down drinks) for $40.    An excellent stop on your way back from Red Rock Canyon, which is highly recommended and an easy drive from the center of downtown Vegas."}
{"text":"My husband and I are making the rounds through the Irish Pubs here in Las Vegas and we finally got to this spot about 3 weeks ago.  I had seen the sign and loved the name for a long time but we live on the other side of town so it took awhile to actually eat here. It was not, at all, worth the wait and the drive.  We went on a Friday night, got there around 7 p.m..  It was obviously busy, like you'd expect on a Friday night, but it wasn't anything outrageous.  We stood at the Hostess podium for a good 10 minutes without even being acknowledged.  Employees (servers and the woman who eventually seated us) were going all around us, doing things, not one bothered to make eye contact and say they would be right with us.  I've worked as a hostess and I find that really annoying - it only takes a second.  Finally after about 10 minutes, a guy says there's no open tables and there will be a short wait.  That's fine - except there isn't really anywhere to wait that's out of the way.  The bar section was full.  So we had to kind of stand in the doorway and move every time someone wanted/needed to get thru.  The layout of the place is weird.  Also, it was really warm inside. Anyway, after about another 15 minutes or so (felt like forever), we were finally seated.  The menu is very blah - didn't have the traditional Irish Pub charm we were looking for.  The music was super loud and plain old American radio crap (no Irish music!).  It absolutely stunk of cigars.   I don't remember exactly what we ordered but pretty sure I had a burger.  All 3 (friend joined us) of us were unimpressed.  The food was just bland and boring.  Again, it was typical American diner/restaurant food, which isn't what we were hoping for going to an Irish Pub.  And it wasn't even good!  We definitely left food behind on our plates and didn't bother to bring home any left overs. So after all that waiting, the food was crappy.  The service was fine, unremarkable enough that I can't remember even whether we had a man or a woman.  Overall, we definitely won't be coming back any time soon and I won't recommend it to any friends.  There are plenty of other Irish Pubs here that are far better!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I love the Three Angry Wives and frequently stop in for a little pub atmosphere with delish eats and MANY icy cold draft beer choices at reasonable prices!  Even better during Happy Hour!  Breakfast is always great too!  We've never been disappointed with anything on their menu.  The staff is usually pretty friendly, not always quick, but hey - if you holler, they'll be right over!!  Their breakfast burrito is one of the best ever and is huge, so we usually end up sharing it . . . we also love the crispy shrimp wrap, baja chicken wrap, philly chese steak and their potato skins are great too!  My 8 year old daughter loves the sliders and actually asks for them from time to time! :)    We don't usually partake in gaming there, but the few times that we have, we've had no problems with our comps -- we've always been comped while playing.    Nice neighborhood gem -- we love places like this and always try to support the community.  It's not a 5-star only because like I mentioned service can be slow and because you often leave smelling of smoke (but they do have a smoke-free) area too. This one is one of our faves!"}
{"text":"Nice and dark inside as a proper pub should be. Good food, you can smoke, friendly staff, jovial regulars, what more could you want?"}
{"text":"This is just OK. Everything about it is just OK. Food, gaming, people, etc. Same guys are always there at night, not overly friendly, just doing their jobs. I hate when you order sliders and it is 3 separate little buns but one regular hamburger patty cut into 3 sections, after being cooked. Doesn't resteraunts understand a slider is supposed to have the crisp browning all the way around?"}
{"text":"Worst service in the world!  20 minutes at table and still no waitress/waiter! Can't decide which is more sticky - the  table or the menu. Came here for the yelp reviews of food and should of listened to the reviews on service. The reason the service is so bad is because they add 18% tip to all orders regardless of size. Why give good service when tip is automatic?!?  #HorribleManagementDecision."}
{"text":"Bartender wouldn't comp my drinks. When I asked why he said I only played $20 (when I was actually playing for over an hour and lost $60 and lost quite a bit more earlier in the week). Been living in Vegas off and on for about a decade and never experienced such bad service. Hey bartender go check my players card (played last machine - around 3am August 1st ). I've played a lot recently because you are a block from my house, but that is the last time I go there again."}
{"text":"Have a really great time - I've been here before and really enjoyed myself then as well. I totally approved of the staff again, and was more than pleased with the food selections. We had nachos which is a favorite- rectangle chips- so that's cool- she ordered potato skins- he liked the nachos and neither of us finished either plate. Tons of tvs to stare at if you're bored :) perfect music volume for a great conversation. I hope infer to go again soon!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of 3 Angry Wives for the past couple of years. I have introduced my family and friends to the pub and have never had a problem at the Charleston location until of course today. I was at the pub on Friday specifically to ask if one of the football games on Sunday you would be airing was the Raider/Miami game. I was told by both the bar back and server that yes, if I brought my group of people in, we would be able to watch this game. We arrive this morning early and asked that one of the TV's at the bar could be turned to the game and were told that no  - you were only airing four specific games, the Raiders not being one of the four. Then to insult us more, it wasn't good enough that we are paying customers who would be there for well over four hours eating and drinking, we were told that since no one asked the female bartender's permission to watch our game, she could put it on one screen but if someone came in and wanted to play the machine and watch a different game, she would just take it off.   How dare she! REALLY??? Our money isn't good enough to view something we had already been told two days prior that we could watch????   At any rate, I am never coming back to spend money at your pub - nor will my friends or family. You need to have your bartenders get schooled in customer service. I am disgusted by the way we were treated.   We actually found a much more friendly place to watch our game and will continue to spend our money with them as they actually care about their customers."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would do not eat here probably the most horrible customer service I have ever experienced I ordered through uber eats they messed my whole order up literally forgot my chilli gave me a burger I didn't even order so I called the bar cause that's all that was open at this time the man who answered the phone was extremely rude to me told me to call uber eats and deal with it through them he said he didn't have time to sit here and talk on the phone I didn't get his name but I'm guessing he was the bartender I hope nobody eats here you don't deserve to be open treating customers like this"}
{"text":"Last Sunday my husband and I went to Three Angry Wives Irish Pub in Summerlin specifically to get a sandwich that was recommended to us. This was the Chicken Cobbler Ciabatta ($9.99)- breaded chicken breast topped with cobbler baked apple slices, dried cranberries, cheddar cheese, lettuce, and honey Dijon sauce - sounds intriguing, doesn't it? I am a fan of the Bobbie sandwich at Capriotti's, which is basically Thanksgiving on a hoagie, so I was looking forward to trying a similar version here. Well, this was the perfect example of how sometimes something can sound good in theory but in reality, or in the hands of the wrong person, becomes a failure. In this case the sandwich was not totally without merit, but left plenty of room for improvement nonetheless. It seems appropriate to make a compliment sandwich for the Chicken Cobbler by pointing out something positive, followed by its problems, and finishing on another high note.  Dear Sandwich, The ciabatta bread you were served on was fresh and performed it's job well. Unfortunately, you were too sweet and one dimensional. Your apples weren't necessarily a bad choice but the 'cobbler' didn't work for me. Additionally, I would like to see you served with crispy chicken that wasn't fried thirty minutes ago when I placed my order but not delivered until now. I hold this more against the slow kitchen and servers than you, so don't feel too bad. At least your chicken was still juicy. Finally, I'd like to commend you on your choice of plate partner - I very much enjoyed the fries! Sincerely, Frugal Foodie  In addition to the sandwich, we had a bowl of chicken and dumpling soup ($5.99), which was flavorful but a little too thick. I won't quite compare it to gravy but it was moving in that direction. Ian also had a Bloody Mary that was one of the better he's had in town. The award for top Bloody Mary goes to Hash House, and is the only reason to ever step foot in that restaurant (Hash House exemplifies everything that is wrong with dining in America by encouraging people to eat enough food for a week in one sitting).  As I mentioned in my letter to Sandwich, the kitchen was ridiculously slow and the servers were sweet but not entirely competent. It took ten minutes to order our food and another thirty five to get it out, and this was on a Sunday morning in a Pub. I'd be weary of going back during peak times. My soup wasn't hot when it came out and we overheard the kitchen staff gripe, so I wasn't left with the best taste in my mouth (or maybe that was their spit?). Overall, we walked out of Three Angry Wives as Two Semi-Angry Customers, and will not likely be returning for the mediocre pub food."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out since Uber eats was picking up from there. They estimated the food to get to us 30 minutes. The food was being prepared for atleast 45 minutes. We live down the road so my driver was able to get to us in 10 mins, she was great. Onions rings were good with the cajun mayo, however for $7 they were small and didn't give enough. I ordered the \"Braveheart Sandwhich\" for $11. If it wasn't soggy, it would've been good.  While digging through my fries, i found a piece of hair underneath the liner of my container. Gross. My fiance got the \"Get Some Burger\" for $11.The burger was supposed to have jalapeños, cheese sauce and shoestring onions. All that came with it was the cheese sauce. It tasted just like a regular burger. Overall, probably wouldn't try it again especially since there was a hair on my plate."}
{"text":"This is a horrible place to have fun. 2 and a half weeks ago. I went in to play a couple of twenty a on video poker. When I put a twenty in , I ordered a beer, 140 quarters later, I ordered another. The bartender (if that's you want to call him) told me I would have to play every quarter, win or lose. Then put another 20 in before I could have another beer. I still had 55 quarters left at that time, so I checked my e-mails then played it down to 40 quarters. The bartender then told me not only that he could not compt me for the first beer, and that I would have to pay for the second. Even though I declined it, due to the fact that he opened it after informing me about their non VEGAS policy. I had no choice other than to pay for 2 beers or play the remaining 10 dollars on dollar play(5 times 1). Original Vegas locals , stay away from this b"}
{"text":"GREAT HAPPY HOUR 2-6pm Monday-Friday. Half price beers and appetizers. *Another reviewer stated that they had a bad beer selection of ONLY American beers.  This is not true.  They have Bass, Harp, Guiness, and Stella ON TAP.*  They have a smoke-free restaurant with comfortable booths and a large bar where you can smoke.  The food is good.  Excellent french fries and battered fish.  The local newspaper usually has a 2 for 1 coupon, so 2 people can eat and drink for under $20.  I wish I could give this place 5 stars for the value.  The food is 4 stars."}
{"text":"Migle was a conscientious and fabulous server. Very upbeat and positive. Knew the menu inside and out.  She gave wonderful recommendations. Glasses were chilled and the beer ice cold. It's nice when people pay attention to details!  Very refreshing in a day and age where deplorable service is ubiquitous."}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time ever. I wasn't impressed with their breakfast at all. Their Huevos Rancheros SUCK! That was the most awful excuse for huevos rancheros I have ever seen!! I could not eat it, it was gross! Sorry guys, but you need to remove that item from the menu!"}
{"text":"Solid pub food on a menu with a few nice surprises. Not overpriced, about what I'd expect from such a venue. Service was solid, drinks refilled, orders correct. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times. We stop by for a couple of beers and once we ordered food. They have a huge menu and their food is also good. It's near our house and it's an easy bar to relax at."}
{"text":"Food was very decent. Very good tasting burgers! Prices are O.K. but when I went we had a deal of a coupon for buy1 get1 entrees. I enjoyed the dim lite atmosphere. You can certainly relax, enjoy a cold beer, watch a game and enjoy some tasty food.  The bar is divided into two parts, a dinning area and the bar/dinning of course. The dinning area is small and not as cozy. I'd prefer for larger tables in the bar/dinning area because your plates can barely fit.   The only bad thing I could say is that the table was kinda sticky, not very clean but heck! I really enjoyed my Shamrock Burger :)"}
{"text":"If you find yourself getting a flavor of the \"real las vegas\", check out the increasingly trendy Summerlin area just north of the strip and closer to the actual Red Rock Mountains.  Three Angry Wives is one of my staple stops during my twice a year visits to Sin City, aka Las Vegas. Located well off the famous strip and away from the downtown crush of tourists, this Irish themed bar-pub- casino reminds me of typical pubs you would find in any modest sized city across America.    Classic pub grub is surrounded by some unique takes on Irish classic dishes.  3AW releases a steady stream of coupons and discounts that make going here with a friend an ideal and affordable choice.  If you want a good meal, don't want to cook and kinda feel like staying in your sweat pants... This spot is calling you. Your wallet will also smile."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood place geared toward locals in Boca Park Shopping Center. Like all these neighborhood places the bar is closed off from the restaurant which is a relief for non-smokers.    Hubby and I tried this place around 4 p.m. on a weekday and the food was pretty good. We had a couple of sandwiches and fries and two iced teas. Nobody serves water here unless you ask for it. Our bill came to about $25.   We'll probably be back. I prefer if over Bilbo's down the street."}
{"text":"my wife ordered a spinach salad through uber, we get the food and her salad is fuckin small, it is not worth the price and it is a rip off, i ordered better salad from a diffrent place with more portion for the same price, this place is a rip off, theh gave my wife, literally a baby hand scoop of salad with chopped boiled eggs. and baby crumbles of bacon bits and blue cheese, seeiously, i want my dam money back this is a waste of money and now we are going out tonight.this was fuckin billshit!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious food.  The burger I ordered as med rare was cooked perfectly, unusual in today's cook it well society.  All four in our group loved the food we ordered and the waitress was fantastic.  Friendly service without being pushy at all.  Love it and will return again. Be sure to try to Mac and Cheese appetizers they are to die for."}
{"text":"Awful service! Read the reviews but decided to try it anyways.. Walked in, waited close to 5 minutes for anyone to say a word to us though it was NOT busy. Finally got seated, waitress clearly hates her job.. We ask for a beer list and she says \"it's right in front of you\" then we ask about beer prices which are not listed on the menu.. She says \"i don't know, I couldn't tell you\" LOL what a joke! We walked out, never to return"}
{"text":"We've gotten takeout from here a couple times and I have figured out why the 3 wives are angry.. Because pretty much everyone who works here is angry or in a bad mood ... sheeeesh! The food alone is not that bad though.. about 3 star worthy.  We have tried: *Grilled Hot & Chopped Greek Salad: $11.99 I love Greek salad so I enjoyed this dish.. it's topped with grilled Gyro meat and warm pita bread.. *Buffalo Chicken Sliders: $9.99 Comes with 5 sliders.. nothing impressive.. prepare to get messy.. We paid an extra $1.99 for onion rings but they gave us fries.. *BBQ Chicken Grilled Pita Pizza: $11 the pizza is 6\" so it's not that big but it comes with soup or salad.. I guess this is one of their \"healthier\" choices haha   HOT TIP: if you want to avoid the super smoky bar air use the back entrance ...it's smoke-free~"}
{"text":"First time here - ordered the Shepard's Pie.  Now I know that this isn't an authentic Irish Pub and I wasn't expecting that but come on guys - at least make an effort!  My Shepard's Pie consisted of a bland mixture of ordinary ground beef (no seasoning I could detect) mixed with green beans for some ungodly reason covered by a layer of bland potatoes covered by a layer of melted cheese that very well could have been Kraft singles.  It wasn't baked slightly roasty like you'd expect in an actual Shepard's Pie but rather could very well have been microwaved.  It was all less than mediocre.  Additionally the manager/bartender there, Reggie, is visibly stressed and provided less than polite service.  Possibly an OK place to get a Harp or a Guiness (though there are far better) but don't eat there."}
{"text":"After reviewing previous reviews I had to think twice about trying Three Angry Wives because of the service issues.  We had a wonderful experience.. service as well a quality of food.  Do not let the reviews sway you from trying this establishment.  I had the fish and chips, caesars salad (loved it), Husband had the bangers mash (just OK). All sandwitchs look wonderful coming out of the kitchen, I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"We're in the area and it's time for dinner.  Heading into the closed off section for diners, we sat in a booth.  We chose to order from the dinner entree section of the menu, which is only available from 4 pm to 11 pm.  All entrees are served with soup or salad, vegetables, garlic bread; and a choice of a baked potato, mashed potatoes or fries.  * BBQ Pork Ribs \"Slow cooked with our own sweet savory sauce.\" ($18) - The Husband ate up all his pork ribs, along with the sides.    * New York Steak \"14 oz. steak, lightly seasoned, broiled to your liking, topped with mushrooms sauteed in fresh garlic and herbs.\" ($19) - I finished up my steak and mushrooms, along with my string beans and baked potato.  There was nothing special about our meal, it was standard food although a bit expensive.  Service was fine, they had a steady stream of customers coming in to dine as well.  Apparently, they do have a happy hour so it's better to call ahead to check what times they happen."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. I liked the music & the atmosphere but it was too dark to read the menu (the couple that came in as we were leaving had an offer to turn a light on.) There was no official server, which I understand can't be helped if someone calls out, but I was really disappointed with our experience. I ordered a veggie potato add cheese & it was accidentally put into the computer with an \"add ham.\" I told the guy that took our order & picked the ham off & ate it...not a big problem. Except that nothing was done to make it right & he just seemed really annoyed with us. When we got the bill I was charged for the added ham. I asked him about removing it & he told me he did me favor bc the charge for cheese cost more than ham. He said he \"could read body language\" & didn't like that my husband (a restaurant manager) seemed upset. He then offered to make me another potato?? Bc that's what I wanted after we finished our meal. Um...if you make a mistake & admit it was your fault & you inconvenienced a customer you at least try to make it right without a poor attitude. Needless too say I left with nothing but a paid 50$ tab & a frown."}
{"text":"Bartenders were amazingly slow and unfriendly, never came by unless waved down. Bar currently has 7 people and there are 3 people behind the bar and they couldn't look more serious. No personalities. Will never be back."}
{"text":"When you're in the mood for a good beer in a dark bar with yummy comfort food this is the spot. My only wish is that I could enter the non-smoking section without walking through the smoking section."}
{"text":"I thought this place was a good choice to try out and I was right.  My boyfriend and I sat at a little bar table and had a good view of a baseball game.  I wanted to try one of their specialty dishes and asked our server about the Meat Loaf and she sold me on that item.  My boyfriend choose the beef stroganoff dish with egg noodles.  Both dishes were very flavorful and very large in portions.  By the time we left, we were so full!  The service and food was great!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Hoping to get an authentic Irish pub experience with Irish beer and friendly people? Don't come here. No Kilkenny or Smithwicks. Nothing on the food menu is remotely non-American. Unless you count Shepard's Pie, which is actually English so you shouldn't count it. In a pretty much empty bar, I got asked to move by the bartender so some old guy could gamble at the machine I was sitting at. Go gamble at one of the other eight empty machines, Old Yellow Hands!  It's pretty much just a PT's that never take their St. Patrick's Day decorations down."}
{"text":"We were here on a Saturday afternoon and had lunch.  The food was good and the service was awesome. Shannon at the bar is the best!"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant.  They always have coupons.  Food is good, service excellent. I have never had anything I did not like.  A las Vegas bargain. My favorite thing I almost always order is a Patty Melt.  They have a very good menu. Lot of good stuff. Dining room is enclosed, so no smoking there.  there is another room that has the bar,, Tv's etc."}
{"text":"First time here. Others picked the restaurant for lunch. Service was fine, it was the food that was terrible. I had the Ruben that had absolutely no flavor. Someone else had the fish & chips. They said it had a very fishy taste. They didn't finish it.  I can't speak for the others but I'd never go back. Very disappointing. The parking lot is difficult to get into as it's enteabce is next to Starbucks drive-thru."}
{"text":"Okay, so bottomless salads can only go so far before the smoke and hit-or-miss service starts to wear on you. We have returned on several occasions, and sometimes the experience is great. Other times, it is a bit lackluster and reeks of cigar smoke. For optimal eating enjoyment, I recommend sitting in the smoke-free side room or directly at the bar. The middle area receives less than stellar service and the majority of the smoke. Also, if you're a Notre Dame fan, this is definitely a spot for brethren. If you're not, you will want to avoid when the Fighting Irish have a game, as the game definitely takes precedence over anything else that may be happening, including you trying to enjoy dinner. Still, I do think they do bar food well, and they definitely serve an ice cold beer. I appreciate both!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time after a few people had raved about some of the things on the menu.  If you like a cool looking Irish pub, it definitely has that appeal inside.  The downside was I felt a little bit cramped.  I ordered one of the chicken sandwiches and it was cooked just alright.  Five hard pieces of iceberg lettuce was a little bit of a turn off, but it was alright.  I felt that the machines were a little stiff but only played a few hundred.  It was packed for the Michigan Ohio state game.  If you are looking for a place to watch football, this is a pretty cool place in the area, however the food was just average.  I'm told the buffalo chicken dip is good so I will try that next time!"}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and dinner. My friend and I were originally going to hit up Applebee's for burgers but the curbside appeal of this place drew us in. At first glance the crowd is a bit older and mellow for a Friday night. The staff was friendly and not overbearing. We started off with a couple drinks that were nicely poured ;-) I don't consider myself a light weight but 3/4 into my long beach tea I was feeling it! I ordered the southern comfort, which is a heaping pile of deliciously smooth and fluffy mashed potatoes swimming in chicken noodle soup. It was so good! Definitely a comfort food. OH and did I mention the garlic toast!? After my stomach settled and I downed my second Long beach tea I was ready for mashed potato heaven round two.   We sat away from the bar in the dinning section and they let us hang out at our booth well after they closed the section down. The music was good and I'm sure geared more towards the staff than patrons but that worked perfect for us 20 something girls. Everything was very clean, food looked and tasted great, and drinks were reasonable. I  will definitely be back. Only reason I rated it 4/5 is because I didn't get a chance to experience the bar atmosphere. However, that was my fault for sitting in the other section."}
{"text":"Three Angy Wives pub won me over with it's decadent french toast that's more dessert than breakfast. Located in the Boca Park shopping center, Three Angry Wives doesn't immediately come to mind as a breakfast choice, but I had a coupon for a buy one get one free entree in my local Entertainment coupon book handy. My husband and I opted to sit in the quiet smoke-free dining section of the restaurant for this visit.  REESE'S FRENCH TOAST ($9.99): Battered in Captain Crunch peanut butter cereal and topped off with melted peanut butter and hot fudge. Tasted as good as it sounds. I was in fat girl heaven. And yup, I slathered on Ms. Butterworth's syrup to top it all off. Talk about a high-calorie meal! Came with 3 pieces of french toast, but I only finished half. I'll ask for the half-order next time. 4.5/5     MAYDAY MUFFIN ($9.99): Sausage, egg, and cheese inside two english muffins with a side of hashbrowns. Husband approved of the breakfast but hashbrowns could've used more flavor. 4/5  SERVICE: Waitress was quiet but efficient. An 18% auto-gratuity is tacked on when using the Entertainment coupon.   VIBE: A good old-fashioned Irish pub.  Worth a Return Visit? Breakfast is better than lunch here! Trust me, I know from experience (said in Chris Farley's voice from Billy Madison). The Reese's french toast is calling my name.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #233"}
{"text":"If you want bad service make sure you ask for Taylor L. We requested to have our bills split due to being a large party. She refused and stormed off from our table and had the nerve to refuse service to us. The worst part was, was that we weren't able to address it. There was no manager, and the response we got from another staff member was that she was having a bad day! Really....Can I act that way at work? No! They then sent a bus boy to serve us, which not to mentioned, turned our entire service around. He did a great job, Thank you! Anyway, when our food came out, she placed our food on a booth a few feet away and wouldn't even deliver the food to our table. After our meal we asked to have the contact number to someone we can reach out to as we thought her behavior was not acceptable she still had the nerve to laugh it off. I never had anything like this, but if you go there make sure she isn't serving you! Other then this, the food was great!"}
{"text":"My first experience was a Ribeye steak and no complaints, service was ok and I said, I'll come back here again.  However, months later when we visited again...downhill it went...no hostess, so you seat yourself and the waiter came about 15min later...this should've been a sign, however we waited, and waited.  They kept walking pass us until another patron offered us his menu.  We were rather hungry and didn't want to leave to find another place to have dinner, since we had a BOGO Free coupon.  I should've left, is all I know.  It appears they prepare food that is already processed, the plate was not hot...just overall bad business.  It's basically a sports bar, and I'll never visit again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place where everybody knows your name, and they are always glad you came...then The Wives should be your first stop! The food is incredible, the service gets 5 stars, and I never saw so many people hit jackpots! Check out this place for a good time and local-loving."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the happy hour beer pricing. I'm not a huge beer fan but the Angry Orchard beer tasted like a hearty apple cider, it was crisp and refreshing without being the least bit bitter. The mushroom sliders weren't part of the happy hour pricing but they were worth every penny. They were served piping hot with the sauteed mushrooms and onions melding perfectly with the cheese and sweet bun. The burger patty was seasoned perfectly for my taste. The Nachos were HUGE. They were quite tasty as well with so many toppings including chili, and marinated jalapenos. We ordered the white steamed mussels (also not on the happy hour menu) and the portion was also generous with several pieces of garlic bread to sop up the delectable broth. The onion rings were okay, nothing special but the cajun mayo sauce that accompanied it was a surprise treat. Service was excellent, however as it got busier in the bar, the drinks started coming out slower. I was also annoyed that a whole family complete with small kids came in and sat close by with a screaming kid. I realize it's not the fault of the restaurant but it still soured the experience for me a bit.   I like the friendly staff and that Angry Orchard beer, besides happy hour for 3 people came to just under $40 with all that food plus drinks!"}
{"text":"As for Irish pubs go, I prefer going to other places but my roommate at the time swore by this place so I went.  Food is actually decent so that was a gift in itself.  It's hard to find decent bar food and when you get out of work as late as I do, you want something tasty.  The bartenders, it depends on who is on at the time.  Some are personable but most just aren't and when i go to a place like this I expect the staff to be more jovial.  It's a pub.  It seemed too stuffy for me.  Prices are ok.  I only come here to see my old roomie so for the most part I have a beer and then I just bounce."}
{"text":"We used to love this place. The food is very good. What ticked us off the last time we went was the bartender. He was jamming out to rap music and kept turning it up. I could not hear my husband. I was under the impression their was a jukebox? A pub is a place you go to have a pint and some chips (vinegar and salt...yummy) watch some football and have a good time. This is the second time this has happened and we won't be going back. My husband is from the UK and we want a place where we can get that feel. This is not a true Irish pub, so for the people who say it is...you have never been to an actual pub in the UK. I also stunk of smoke and did not finish my drink. From pub to club. Boo!"}
{"text":"We just stopped in for a drink. It's a great Irish Pub, we did not try any food.  But for drinking it's great!"}
{"text":"Bartenders are not personable, and I've been here multiple times. Save your money for a fun bar and leave these douchebags alone. Maybe then they will be more appreciative of new business  Also, i have heard nothing but rotten things about their st pattys day festival of overpriced admission and drinks."}
{"text":"So, I we go to this bar generally 3-4 times a year and normally it was an all around good time. Went Monday December 10th and !*NOT A GOOD! TIME. The Bar tender wearing a Patriots jersey would not even say HI to us after we sat down. We had to ask for  food menus, he threw one of the table.(there was 2 of us) Then we had to ask, after waiting 20 minutes if its ok if we ordered some food? He said sure, (felt like it was a problem that we were ordering food?) Then after getting our two plates $19 a piece, we had to ask for some silverware. Food was good as always, but his (both bar tenders actually) customer service was terrible. MY GIRLFRIEND AND I DID NOT FEEL WELCOMED AT THIS BAR. WE WON\"T BE RETURNING AT ALL NEXT YEAR. NOT WORTH THE DRIVE ACROSS TOWN ANYMORE=("}
{"text":"This has been my go-to spot for years.  The service is fantastic, the prices good, and the food is amazing.  I have yet to find better wings anywhere in Vegas.  I try to stop in at least once a week for wings and a cold beer."}
{"text":"Nice place. They serve what you  might call \"pub food\"- wings, grilled cheese, fries, salads, etc. at reasonable prices.  I've gone there mainly to make use of their wireless internet connection while enjoying lunch or dinner.  The staff leave you alone and don't rush you at all. The food is fine- nothing special. The service is good and the waitstaff have always been super friendly."}
{"text":"This is our #1 spot for a late night breakfast.  A HUGE (very splittable) plate, of awesome breakfast food is around 7 dollars.  Everything on their menu is delicious, and they have an awesome selection.     They have a smoke-free dining area sectioned off from the bar, with large booths, and a few tables.  You can also eat at the bar, or in their little lounge area.  They have some suuuuper cozy, squishy, leather couches there.  The only thing I dislike about 3AW is that it's a sports bar. Everything on their tvs must be sports at all times.  Sometimes they have the hunting channel on (EW!), but the bartender has never refused to change it for me."}
{"text":"For a pub this place is simple, decor is cool, lots of Tv's and music. They have a lounge area for comfy seating and tables.  Food was ok. Pretzel bits app was good because it came with really good cheese dip.  You can never go wrong with draft beer.    Most of all the bartender was very nice and attentive.  Just disappointed there wasn't a big Irish menu."}
{"text":"Cold crisp draft beer!!!! There were 2 Bartenders working that were very friendly and polite... One recommended a Chicken sandwich with Cranberries that was awesome, steak sandwich was ok but not recommended by the staff...  The bar was very laid back inside people kept to themselves more of a real locals hangout.  Clean bathroom with plenty of soap and paper towels :)  For a bar that allows smoking it didn't smell like a astray inside great ventilation... The meals were under $10.00 very inexpensive & the beer was cheap in cost also.."}
{"text":"This place is just a cool pub to hangout. Its a good place to get out, grab a couch, some beer and wings and catch the game!  Definately two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I would have given 4 stars since the food was great,  but service is a real problem here. The Yelpers were right!  First, we waited for 15 minutes to be seated.  Then,  once we sat down and ordered drinks, we waited again.  Our waitress finally showed up to take our food order. Guess what? We waiting probably another 15 minutes just to get our salads. Not cool.   We finally got oir food,  which was delicious- shepherds pie and lemon herb chicken.  After we got our order, our waitress seemed to disappear.  Busboys were checking on us, refilling drinks, getting leftover boxes, AND getting oir check. Our waitress didn't deserve the tip they automatically add to the check. I disagree with that because her tip would have been much less than they add. Unacceptable. It's too bad because the food was great.  Service needs some serious improvement!"}
{"text":"Best Pub in Las Vegas.   Awesome food, great specials, fun crowd.  This place is packed during Patriots games, and has an amazingly lively crowd, they make every game fun. Food is terrific, great wings, awesome fish & chips, and wonderful Shepherd's Pie!"}
{"text":"The music machine is not playing. I ordered food they were throwing out and asked to pay extra for an an extra serving,  they chose to throw it out then give a customer the left overs. WOW!!!"}
{"text":"They have a nice selection of beers available. I had a Summer Shanty which was a bit too lemony for my taste buds ($5) and a loaded baked potato ($7.99) which is very nice with lots of bacon....mmm bacon......bacon.....bacon.  I actually like their chicken fried steak here too.   It's a dark Irish bar, with lots of gaming seats, and also some couch and table sitting with several TV's. A few games like Golden Tee. There's also a dining area thats sectioned off from the smoking bar. A nice place to meet friends, grab a bite to eat with decent and fairly priced food and a huge selection of items."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for a former coworker's going away gathering. The service was quick. However, I was not impressed with the drinks or food. I had a side order of fries with cheese; the fries were dry tasting. When I ordered my first drink, I asked for vodka with a splash of cranberry juice. It came out fine. The second time around, a different server refilled my drink. When I raised my hand to get her attention for my refill, she knew that I previously had vodka and cranberry; she walked away to fill my order so quickly, that I didn't get the chance to tell her \"a splash of cranberry juice.\" My second drink came out tasting and looking like a glass of cranberry juice. I went for something different with my third drink - a lemon drop shot. It tasted watered down, which is odd since it had no ice in it.   I asked about happy hour specials prior to ordering and was told the appetizers were half off before 6:00 p.m. When my bill came, I had a 50% discount for the base price of the $6 side order of fries and was charged $1 extra for the cheese. My two vodka and cranberry drinks were $5.50 each. My lemon drop was $6.50. Overall, the food and drinks were not worth the $23.45 that I paid (not including the tip)."}
{"text":"This place's food was good but the waitress was horrible, she seemed like she was occupied with other things and took forever to take our order, then they used the excuse \"oh we are swamped\" When we entered the place they were not busy at all. Now that is bull, she was unable to handle having our table. This place was recommended by several people as well, might go back to try the food, there were more dishes I wanted to try, but will ask for a different server next time!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here and ordered the Corned Beef and Cabbage at the bar. Most of the bar space was occupied by built-in slot machines giving little room for eating. Bartender acknowledged me as soon as I sat down and took my order down as soon as I was ready. Wait time for my order was minimum. The salad prior to my entree was fresh and of good size. My entree was huge in portion but disappointing because they used corned beef slices that were thin and used for sandwiches instead of the thick sliced corned beef that I was used too when ordering such an entree. I wouldn't recommend the entree to a true Irishman if needed be. Ordered a drink for desert and that was it. Nothing really stand out for me in this establishment that would make me want to come back again on my own."}
{"text":"I went here, Diane and friends in tow, for my St. Patrick's Day Corned Beef & Cabbage fix two days before St. Patrick's Day to avoid the teeming crowds that always occur on that festive day.  After enjoying very good cheesy Tater Skins that were topped with cheese, bacon pieces, and chives; a fine cup of Tomato Florentine Soup; and a Dinner Salad with good Honey Mustard Dressing that was Dijon-like, the eagerly awaited desired entree was set before me.  As hoped for, it featured excellent lean Corned Beef and perfectly buttered and cooked cabbage that just barely covered the vast amount of Corned Beef (1 lb.) that was heaped on the platter.  An abundant supply of boiled Potatoes were al dente and perfectly cooked, as well.   The others at my table enjoyed a full order of Fish & Chips and Shepherd's Pie.  There was a wait of about 13 minutes between being given menus and the return of our server to take orders, and we had a movie to get to.  Otherwise service was good.  5 stars for the Corned Beef & Cabbage, and 4-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"Night bartenders tonight were so rude and uncalled for. I feel disrespected even though I brought half of the bar in tonight just to relax and have fun, and then to be treated badly by a rude bartender is uncalled for. he's lucky im old enough to pay my tab an walk away.. never again."}
{"text":"We seem to go to Three Angry Wives when one of us is returning from McCarran.  I don't know why, since it's nowhere near the airport!  Last night was no exception.  It's a new menu, which usually means higher prices.  I think the entrees are higher, but the sandwiches and wraps don't seem to have gone up much, if at all.  Hubby and I shared a Romaine and Spinach Chopped Salad with BBQ chicken breast, avocado, tomato.  The salad was excellent, with moist, warm chicken.  We also shared a Paslawmi Sandwich - a grilled garlic French roll piled high with flavorful, lean pastrami, cheese, and cole slaw.  The hubster wanted potato salad, so I indulged him; I usually don't like most potato salads, but a taste of this one made me want more.  Service was excellent from Kandi, our server, who's been there since the place opened.  She certainly had plenty of patience, since we took forever to decide what we wanted.  I sure hope business is better earlier in the evening; as usual, after the one other table left, we closed the dining room.  I would hate to see this place leave.  Great food, great service, and regular coupons in the newspaper.  What more could you want??"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! This only for the bar section. My boyfriend decide to give this bar a try since it's down the street from our house.  1st problem at the bar. They had sign on the machine ( if you're not gambling don't sit here ) 2nd normally if you gamble you get your drink comp ( not here ) 3rd bartender who said his the manager ( mixed guy with dreadlock work on April 3rd at night )  the rudest person I have ever encounter. When my boyfriend asked him a simple question aren't drinks comp when gambling? The manager responded that we did not gamble enough  to get a round of drinks. It's mostly his attitude  the way came off.  He's response was what are you going to do about the charge on the drink and to leave. Ok we only ask a question? This place is a rip off and lacks service. Don't go to this bar save your money."}
{"text":"Oh my God I want to die!  I just ate the Shepard's Pie.  It was so good but I could only finish half of it.   The food in this place is good the prices are great!  It's a definite must for anyone that likes a good Irish Pub!"}
{"text":"Came to Three Angry Wives this time to try out the restaurant (smoke free!!!!) side of this lovely establishment. That means, I showed up sober and before 9PM. GO ME! Anyways, this also happen to coincide with my mission to find a new great blue cheeseburger now that Create [RIP] is gone. First of all, they totally love having kids here (not so much on the bar side). The waitress was awesome and super nice. She was attentive all night and made small talk with the small adults (my term for kids). 5 stars for the customer service. The food was alright. When I was inebriated and had taken part in their potato skins, I would've said it was the greatest thing anyone has made anywhere on earth. But the blue cheeseburger was just okay. I think it just didn't have what I think a blue cheeseburger should have: blue cheese, a good all-beef patty, spinach, garlic aioli, raw red onions and bacon. If someone could open a restaurant and make that, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks. Until then, the search continues...."}
{"text":"Would be 5 stars if I didn't have to deal with cigarette smoke...but it is a bar.  First time visitors for happy hour, and the food was good and the price was great! Beware, the nacho appetizer is huge! We will be coming back!"}

{"text":"Irish bar that offers up breakfast, lunch and dinner!  Went on Sunday morning because it is a NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS bar during their games. Tons of tvs throughout the bar to watch the number one football franchise on the planet!  They did throw on two other games, just in case, there were any non-Patriots fans.   Full menu is offered and during the game they offer up \"football specials\" including New England clam chowda and Lobstah Rolls (which were awesome)! In the third quarter they had a raffle where they gave away Patriots paraphernalia.  There is nothing like visiting from Boston and starting my football Sunday with an egg white omelette and sucking it back w a fresh poured Guinness! Patrons are friendly and will even deal with and treat non-Pats fans well.    Service was excellent and Pricing was reasonable. Uber and taxi service readily available.  The only issue I had was walking out of the bar and having to adjust my eyes to the bright sunlight... but adjusted quickly enough after a huge Pats Win!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for most of my life. Good people and great food. I always get their Sheppard's pie or BBQ Chopped salad. Amazing quality for the price. Family owned and a regular spot in Summerlin for many years."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good music. There's a sign as soon as you enter asking you to sit wherever you like, so not sure why the reviewers from 9 days ago stood at the door for 15 minutes. :) Anyhow, we picked our spot and a server came right over. We asked for menus, which she promptly brought over. We ordered chicken-fried pork chop and wings with fries, Blue Moon for drinks. Everything was very good. Music was a good mix of alternative rock. We will definitely be back. PS - The only negative I have is the wood chairs are a little hard on the backside. But the seats were much more comfy at the bar when we moved over after dinner. We were glad our bartender was nice, the other one did look a little pissy. :)"}
