{"text":"The ladies behind the counter are great and very nice. As I was there they greeted regular customers and remembered their regular orders. Feels like a true community hub to break bread. Menu is quite extensive ranging from soups, salads, sushi, sandwiches, and hot or cold drinks. Great place to grab a quick bite for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"The women behind the counter are as sweet as pie, the sandwiches are inexpensive but taste great/homemade and they have lots of other things on the menu to choose from. It's sort of hidden, one of those place you'd walk by without really noticing it was there which is a shame because it's a gem."}
{"text":"I regularly come here a few times a week; the 2 ladies here are just genuinely great people. Always upbeat, friendly and ready to serve. 

It's great for a snack or even for breakfast/lunch. Could nab a cheap sandwich for about $3-4. Plenty of other snacks/treats; very convenient given the location. The sushi is quite cheap too.

I usually get a turkey sandwich with a small tray of veggies. A good alternative to some of the more pricey places in the area."}
{"text":"The two women who run the mini bar in Toronto are two of the most lovely and genuine ladies who ever ran an independent store in Toronto. The always are smiling and asking how you are and in all honesty, they just give a shit about their customers.

The Atmosphere
      This place is literally a hole in the wall, if you sneeze as you walk by, you've missed it. So don't sneeze! You would miss out on a positive piece of Toronto.

The Food
     This is the place to go to if you want a paperbag lunch. Everything is there from the Jello to the cold cut sandwiches to the chocolate milk in the little cartons. For breakfast, make sure to stop by and they will whip up a delicious fried egg, cheese, bacon and tomato sandwich on a bagel. (my mouth is drooling just thinking about it!)

The Location
     You can find a better location for this type of food joint. Its at Spadina and Adelaide. Just look for the tiny space and walk down the three steps and step into the awesomeness that is the Mini Bar"}
{"text":"I have no clue what I would do without the Mini Bar in my life.  My day feels weird if I don't find myself popping in for a drink, or a snack, or a breakfast sandwich, or a banana...the list goes on and on.

It helps that it is run by two of the sweetest women in the world.  They work long hours and always seem busy (so I doubt they have a lot of down-time) and they do it with a smile and a friendly greeting to everyone who walks in.

It may be the size of a matchbook, but Mini Bar has a lot of heart.  And with super cheap prices ($1 for a pop, $3 for a breakfast sandwich), you too will find it hard not to visit every single day."}
{"text":"Love this place and have been coming off and on for years.  As far as lunch prices in Downtown Toronto- you won't beat it and it's all made right there in front of you or the morning of.

The two ladies are lovely as well.  Lots of assorted items, snacks and goodies for such a small space, too."}
{"text":"The tuna and egg sandwich are the best!!! The perfect portion of all ingredients. Beats the store bought ones any day! Plus the ladies that run this store are really nice"}
{"text":"Mini Bar does live up to its name. You have to bow your head down when you enter through five foot high door, and then, you walk down three steps to what is the size of an office cubicle. This place is tiny, it's minute, it's wee. They don't have a kitchen, they have a hot plate. 

But what Mini Bar lack in space or even a place to sit, they make up for it in customer service and in the food they serve. When a customer came in to order a BLT, one of the ladies who works there, advised her that the existing batch of bacon had over cooked and it wasn't good for consumption. How many places offer that? 

Their menu comprises of mainly cold and hot sandwiches, salads, soups, and sushi. Most of the hot sandwiches are really breakfast sandwiches, and they do them right. My Western ($3.71) was a thick egg sandwich with good chunks of onion and ham. They have a good variety of salads to choose from like garden, coleslaw and seaweed. As for their soups, I ordered their miso soup ($1.25).* 

Don't pass up on Mini Bar. It's a good grab-and-go spot that serves up no frills yet satisfying good eats. 



* I didn't ask but their prices seem to include taxes."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars from me because it's a genius of a place. Tiny, you would almost miss it if you walked by too quickly, this welcoming booth run by the Kim sisters is a one-stop shop for a quick breakfast, lunch, or afternoon snack. I'm not an early bird so I'm not sure when they open but they close at 4pm Monday to Friday.

They make sandwiches, sushi, little salads, veggie trays, and other such lunch standards fresh every day. They will also custom make a breakfast sandwich or lunch sandwich in a few minutes flat. I'm not a fan of their coffee but I see lots of people buy it every day and well, I'm a snob with my java anyway so don't my word for it! 

There's a slew of other quick pit stop choices here - an array of gum, candies, chocolate bars, chips, fresh fruit, baked goods (not theirs I'm pretty sure but freshly purchased every day), and drinks are available at a moments notice. Kind of a glorified convenience store with freshly prepared food choices and the Kim sisters are absolutely lovely as well - happy to support them often!

Oh, and did I mention it's cheap?! My favourite breakfast - egg mcmuffin with egg, cheese and tomato and an orange juice for under $5!"}
{"text":"3.7 can't justify giving a full 4 as I haven't tried everything. So far the sandwiches and rice rolls have been pretty good. I just like the sandwiches because I know the ingredients are fresh and you can ask the owner to make it for you on the spot if what's available is not to your liking. The bread is also thick cut bread. The vegetable sandwich comes out to be $4.5 and the turkey avocado at almost $6 are definitely prices that are hard to come by downtown. 

Recommend if you work nearby!"}
