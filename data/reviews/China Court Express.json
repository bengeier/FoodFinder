{"text":"Ate here a few times because it's close by, the food is not too great and the service is terrible. The employees sound aggressive and I've even gotten sick once from the food.  Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Worst place for Chinese Food in the area. Very small portions n the guy running the show is very rude. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"I started this review earlier and am glad I didn't finish it right away. I have eaten here a few times previously as it's close to a friends house and open late. Unfortunately I got REALLY sick after eating here tonight. I know not to expect the world when I go here. I don't even expect something decent. What I do expect is safe. I'm not sure if it was the wonton soup or the beef and vegetables, but somewhere along the way it was not agreeing with me. Definitely not going back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They aren't the cheapest Chinese food place around but they have great service and amazing food. Their general tao's chicken is the best I've had and it's not coated in some non-descript red sauce, either. It's full of chiles and little \"hairs\" from all of the ginger they use - actual ingredients. Their delivery is suspiciously fast for Chinese food, but they use super hot woks and everything is fresh and hot. They also give you a ton of soy sauce, plum sauce, hot sauce, etc... I have a bit of a collection of packets going.  Best of all, they don't use filler vegetables that no one eats like those giant chucks of onion and green peppers you'll find in the general taos from other places. All of their food is tasty, whether you're going for traditional (I mean Canadian Chinese food \"traditional\") chicken balls and fried rice or you experiment with other dishes like their salt and pepper squid.   My *only* dislikes (and these are my own personal dislikes) are that their sweet and sour pork is mostly that crunchy gristly stuff (I've never found anywhere where it isn't) and their egg rolls have an odd flavour I haven't pinpointed - but get their spring rolls instead: heaven!  Don't be discouraged when what appears to be a 10-year-old boy shows up with your order... he's adorable and it's worth it :) Tip him well if you made him walk really far in the dark on these mean streets."}
{"text":"We ordered the crispy beef and Cantonese chow mein on a Friday night. The dishes were good but I enjoyed the crispy beef better."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the other reviewers had but I've never had an issue with the food here. It's consistently exactly what I expect of the neighbourhood Chinese take-out with a little less grease. Dishes could contain at least a little bit of veggie, but it might just be what I ordered. Japanese-style seafood noodles were tasty, although I don't know if crab stick qualifies as seafood, and definitely could have used any vegetable; I usually expect some onion at least. Definitely a take-out/pickup type of place. I've never seen anyone sit and eat here, nor has it been offered when I go in. Tables there are clearly just a place to hang while the food is made, express it is."}
{"text":"This place is no frills, greasy, westernized Chinese food, perfect for late night cravings.  The restaurant is pretty worn down, it can definitely use a makeover. It looks like it's been the same for 30 years which can be a good thing or a bad thing I suppose.   We ordered for takeout and the service was quite curt but quick. The people in front of us ordering wanted to substitute noodles for their rice and it's a $2 charge but she forgot to charge the customer and then demanded he pay the extra in cash. I thought out of courtesy she would just let it go but that wasn't the case. We placed our order, two meals, one with sweet and sour pork, fried rice and beef with broccoli and the second with lemon chicken, fried rice and chicken chop suet. Our total was under $20 which I think is good for the location.   On our way out the lady taking orders was really thankful and wished us a good night which was certainly nicer than when we walked in.   There was about 3lbs of food in our two containers, a huge portion of rice and chicken chop suey and the meat was generously sized as well. The food was all piping hot and had good flavour, standard to other similar Chinese restaurants, nothing mind blowing or different, but still good! Our favourite part was probably the egg rolls that came with our meal, the wrapper was crunchy and fried perfectly.   Overall I'd definitely come back when I'm in the mood for greasy Chinese food. Certainly not gourmet by any means but cheap, cheerful and enough grease to pad your stomach after a night of drinking!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that makes people think Chinese food is trash.  Their chicken is just breading dressed in sauce and their fried rice is soaked with soya sauce. I felt sick after the first bite and much sicker a few hours after I finished.  The service was awful too. I was ordered and got my food an hour before their closing time, but as I was about to sit down and eat they said I had to leave. When I mentioned that it was still an hour from closing, they said \"fine, 2 minutes\" so I got up and left."}
