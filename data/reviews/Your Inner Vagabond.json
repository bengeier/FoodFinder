{"text":"YIV is a new Middle Eastern themed coffee lounge in Lawrenceville.  So new... that they won't be open until October 2007.  They specialize in Middle Eastern and North African coffees and teas as well as desserts from the area.  

Please visit the website above for more details.

UPDATE: As of October 2009, YIV has been sold to new owners who have reopened it under the name Istanbul Grille."}
{"text":"YIV is amazing. If someone gave me a check for a very large sum of money and carte blanche to design my own coffeehouse/cafe, I'm not sure I could have come up with something so wonderful as this.
The drinks are fabulous - I've tried everything from pistachio soda, to Siamese coffee, to sparkling Meyer lemonade, and have yet to be disappointed. I haven't tried a very large selection of foods (and, on a couple occasions, was told the item I wanted was not available) but the pistachio hummus and fül müdammas were darn tasty. Depending on who's working and what's ordered, service can be sprightly fast or wonderingly slow.
For someone who's never been to YIV, the Sunday brunch is an attractive option - there's various items from the regular menu plus an exotic strata or two. Many of the buffet options are vegetarian or vegan,  but there's also a whole pan of BACON for those who worship the pig.
I've yet to find a place with a more relaxing atmosphere - the back lounge is heavenly, with its pillow-lined coziness. There's usually some un-intrusive global-type music playing (60's French pop or Turkish instrumentals come to mind), and it's BYOB and smoke-free (which can be hard to find in Pittsburgh, sometimes).
And that's not even getting into the crazy variety of events - concerts, yoga, drum circles, film screenings, psychics, performance art - this place is Bohemia x 10.
Update 9-11-09: After a harsh year the current owner is looking to sell YIV - hopefully they will find someone with a similar vision. It would be a shame to lose such a neat place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I'm not surprised at all that they closed. I had been there a few times and had a semi-pleasant time -- an interesting concept, but the food/drinks were nothing terribly special.

The last time I was there, the service was APPALLING. The two guys working the counter were incredibly rude and sassy. I actually heard them mocking me.

I've been to a past Istanbul Grille location, and I'm glad to hear they've taken it over! Hopefully they'll have some servers who aren't stuck-up hipster morons, unlike their predecessor..."}
{"text":"A unique hangout with a harem/lounge aesthetic, and an emphasis on Middle Eastern and North African culture.  They host lots of community events (many of which are free), and they are very accommodating to groups looking to book events there.

All of the food I've tried there is creative, light, and tasty.  The drinks have been consistently excellent, and they have quite a wide selection.  I like the fact that it's BYOB.

The staff is all very friendly, though not very efficient.  My biggest complaint is that, both times I went there, they were very slow to serve my orders.  In their defense, they were relatively busy on both occasions.  Hopefully, this will improve."}
{"text":"They had fantastic and affordable brunch service on Sundays, but abysmal service, an odd corking fee structure, and inconvenient hours. 

The concept was beautiful. It was a shame to see them close. Here's hoping that Istanbul, the new business operating in the same space, has a better run with things."}
{"text":"The only reason I go here is because it's so very very close to my house & they have superfast wireless. The staff is sometimes super helpful and , well, sometimes not very helpful. The walls are bright and cheery, the owners seem to be very committed to the community and providing a space for events that probably have a hard time in other venues - weekly belly dancing, weekly political movie nights, speed dating for single vegetarians, etc. The seating is a lot of low tables and pillows, and yes, there are often a lot of hippies here. The space is bright and open, and provides a \"community\" space - I have seen spirited discussions start up among strangers across the room. 

YIV is open late like a bar, but there's no smoking or alcohol, which is a positive thing, honestly. Some of their special brewed iced teas are heavenly - a lot of other menu items are a little \"eh.\" they can make turkish coffee, but they have no espresso machine. a lot of the beverages are not good when you order them with soy milk, so be careful, my vegans. the food is highly variable, but usually at least edible, and there are vegan options. 

it's good for all ages - ive seen lots of happy little kids here. and the older set too - BYOB with a small corking fee. the flavored sodas are pretty fucking delicious - i recommend lavendar vanilla. 

I definitely get the impression that this is a group of people who are pretty new to running a business, but they are working to make it happen, and I think that's a lot of what Butler Street needs."}
