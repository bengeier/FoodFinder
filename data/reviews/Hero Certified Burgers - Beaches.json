{"text":"Went out of my way to go here on my way home, turned out they decided to close an hour and a half early. Workers inside putting away chairs didnt even acknowledge me at the door (which has their hours printed right on it)
Next time I won't bother risking wasting my time, I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"A great place to go if you're looking for a quick meal. Tried the 6 oz blue moon which features real blue cheese. If you love blue cheese, you'll love this burger!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 burgers and a few sides.  One a gluten free, no cheese and a regular one loaded with goodness.  Came home to find both were with cheese and no indication of which one was gluten free.  After a bit of attempting to distinguish which is GF, we decided to call (one was definitely a darker bun).  Spoke to an associate, than the manager, neither of them being helpful.  

Food allergies are a real thing - as is customer service.  Never again for this location.  I paid $30 for 2 burgers and fries and had to make myself a sandwich. Keep it together people"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here after going to the beach late at night looking for something easy and close by where we parked. We got the regular hero burger and I must say that the portions are HUGE! If you've ever eaten at union burger, they are alike in that they are on the pricier side. A regular hero burger is like five bucks. We got one meal to share and a burger each. I was more than satisfied after eating the hefty burger. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I added this location just so I could tell you how much I hate it. I first went with my boyfriend just after it opened on a Sunday afternoon before I had to go to work. We ordered 2 burgers, 2 poutines and 2 drinks. It was like $30, should have been the first sign. We went about 45 min early so that way I wouldn't be late, even though, I just work down the road. It took us 15 min to even get to the cashier to order, she was all alone and tr place was jammed. After waiting 30 min I decided I should probably head to work and get my boyfriend to drop off the food once it was ready. By the time it arrives 15 min later it was all cold. The cheese for the poutine hadn't even melted. We were both really disappointed. I wrote to head office telling them my experience sucked and in true
form they sent me a $20 gift card. One day I forgot my dinner and headed over on my break for something to eat, gift card in hand. There was only one person ahead of me so I figured it would be fairly quick, boy was I wrong!!! The cashier took forever with the people ahead of me, the people who were supposed to be COOKING my dinner were standing there chatting talking about some flyer that had been given to them with - get this - the owners wife instead of doing their job. There was a new guy training that once my food came it took him 5 min to bag it - poor guy I actually felt bad for him. By the time I gr back to work I was 8 minutes past my 30 min break. What the hell people!! I just hate this place, I will never go back."}
{"text":"The same as every other hero burger. Efficient staff. Appeared as though the manager was serving me and just wanted to serve as quickly as possible. Good options as toppings. Fries are good. Veggie gravy available."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance (because everyone deserves a second chance) but let me down horribly both times. The food is WAY overcooked and tasteless, they never seem to get the condiments right, and the place just smells dirty. 

Terrible, terrible place for a bite in the beaches."}
{"text":"Onion rings and fries were ice cold and it seems that the burgers were hurriedly prepared:  outsides were charred, insides almost raw....condiments were so over done that the bun was just a soggy mess.  

I'd expect a lot better quality of food for 28 bucks (that's the cost of 2 six ounce combos including tax). Save your money, this place is unpredictable."}
{"text":"In town for a nice summer beach break, and came across this burger joint. As someone allergic to gluten, the gluten free options were very convenient for me to enjoy a nice juicy burger (got the Signature burger). Service was awesome too, much better than five guys in the states. Overall, delicious food and great atmosphere at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Just visited here for the first time on the wkend with my bf.  We were both kind of excited to try it as it always seems to be busy.  There was nobody in there as it was getting near closing time on a Sat night.  We waited over 30 minutes for our food.  He got the Hero burger meal and I got poutine.  We live pretty much right beside the restaurant but we drove so that the food would be still hot.  

Poutine was as good as jack Astors and them kind of chains and it was only 4.99$ my bf wasn't crazy about the burger but said he didn't realize how many sauces etc they had and rushed his order as we went so close to closing. Gave it another shot and they've stepped their game up. Keep u all posted."}
{"text":"I went to Hero Burger for the first time today.  I stopped in on a whim because I was running errands in the area.  When I came in it was lunchtime, and it seems I had just missed the rush.  The menu had a massive picture of a delicious looking burger, but I found the menu itself was not laid out well, and I had to keep searching around for what I was looking for.  I ordered a 4oz cheeseburger and a med drink.

After I paid I got to use their fancy pop machine which I liked.  It's one of those computerized ones with a ton of different kinds of pop.  I sat down at the table and noticed that the restaurant was very clean.  I waited for a while, and since mine was the only order, the wait time was noticeable.  It wasn't a terribly long time though, so I just figured I'd be patient for a really good burger.  Once I received my burger and unwrapped it I was disappointed.  Right away I could see that the bun wasn't toasted, the cheese wasn't melted, and the burger seemed a little undercooked.  It also didn't have the charring or the look of the burger on the menu.  I ate it but it was a let down.  I don't know if it was just an off day, if it was a bad location, or a bad burger chain.  I may be willing to try it one more time, but only if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The owner was incredibly cheerful and welcoming. The menu has a huge range of customizable selections as well as classic favourites. I got the wild alaskan salmon burger with a side of onion rings, one of my all-time faves! The ciabatta bun was very soft and the salmon was perfectly cooked. All of the Hero burgers have fantastic flavours, no wonder they're the best burger place around! Definitely my go-to place!"}
