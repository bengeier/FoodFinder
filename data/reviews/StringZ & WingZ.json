{"text":"The ribs sucked royal.  They were boiled and tossed on grill.  Topped with some sorry ass sauce.  Too many items on menu to have decent food.  Gave up on food after the ribs and sandwich.

The service was good and beer cheap.  Good local place to have a drink.  Will continue to go for drinks."}
{"text":"I love this place, that's my review, ok, a little more.  The food is great, I haven't had anything bad on the menu.   The ghostly ridiculous sauce is awesomely hot with a great taste.  I especially like the Cajun Chicken Pizza, and then I get a side of sauce and dip the pizza in it, it's great.
The service is always good and quick.  My favorite bartender, Laura, sees us coming in and has our beer waiting by the time we hit the bar, you can't ask for better."}
{"text":"Why oh why did I come back? Probably because my fiance kept raving about their food. So we walk in and proceed to wait about six minutes at our booth before being acknowledged by our server, Keri. Then it was about 12 more minutes until she returned to take an order. Then my calzone came out cold and my fiance, who got fries, wasn't even offered ketchup. Awesome! After waiting about five minutes I complained to the bartender because our server was MIA. The manager responded and I got a hot calzone. The server clearly continued to have an attitude, however.  I was certain they weren't going to charge me for the calzone but I was wrong. She only removed our pop from our bill and we still had to pay everything else.  She wasn't tipped and we won't be back."}
{"text":"At first glance this bar is unflattering, divey in a downtrodden plaza off of St 14.

I have visited here a few times for Sunday football with my in-laws to watch NFL games.  This place has incredible wings at very inexpensive prices.  They also have very good drink prices.

Don't judge a book by it's cover with this place, I have eaten likely thousands of wings in my day, and these may be the best. 

The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"The trivia league I occasionally participate with relocated from Twinsburg to this joint in Streetsboro.  The location is inconspicuously hidden at the end of a run-down plaza.  I had heard of this place having a reputation as being the best bar in Streetsboro too (not that I planned on drinking; I had to drive 30 minutes to get back home).

StringZ & WingZ - they're really big on the letter Z in an annoying way - has a surprisingly spacious interior and a large bar.  I didn't count, by my guess is that they had 15-20 beers on tap.  Their food selection is pretty standard - chicken wings (the \"WingZ\") and French fries (the \"StringZ\") were ingredients in a lot of the products served here.  Speaking of the \"StringZ\", who the hell calls their French fries \"strings\" (I'm done using the letter Z)?  I'd expect them to use onion rings as their \"strings\", but that's another rant for another day.

The fries were extremely greasy the first time I went there and seasoned with some sort of garlic/salt mix.  They weren't the best I've ever had, but they sufficed.  The fries here on my second visit here was much better.  It was like McDonald's fries, except better seasoned.  I also ordered some boneless wings drenched in OMG Hot Sauce - yes, that's its name - as well as a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich where the chicken was fried and drenched in some Chipotle BBQ sauce.  The boneless wings are homemade and quite large, but the blandness of the sauce and the wings set them back quite a bit.  They were decent, but a little bit more work would make them amazing.  The sandwich was much better, although this menu does not have very many items for those who are health-conscious.

The service here was very good.  I had this server named Nichole who ran back and forth between the cash register and serving us surprisingly well, refilling our drinks and taking back our empty dishes as soon as possible.  I saw two or three other servers on the floor, as well as a bartender, but perhaps they were undermanned that day.  Who knows?  For a wing restaurant, service here was about as good as you can get with a place that has 30-40 customers eating there on an \"off night\".  They also have a food challenge for the gastronomically adventurous.  If I somehow ended up in the Streetsboro area again and needed a nice cold one and some wings, I would definitely stop by here again."}
{"text":"Compared to restaurant chains where the wait wad 20-30inutes wewere seated immediately.  Now, my only disappointment is that I no longer eat meat and the menu doesn't have many vegetarian or pescetarian options, but I still love the place. I ordered the grilled veggie wrap w/fries & brown gravy on the side.  I could tell the veggies were fresh not frozen and my wrap was warm. The fries had a bit too much salt for my taste buds. My husband ordered the turkey panini w/fries & BBQ sauce on the side.  I guess he enjoyed it because he ate the entire thing."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about this place I thought I'd give it a try on a Monday Night. First and foremost, the Budweiser is excellent. Especially when it's in a bottle that is on special for $1!

The wingz (spelling everything with a \"Z\" is kinda lame and annoying, but whatever) were probably the best I've ever had. I was starting to think that I did not like chicken wings anymore because it's been so long since I've had any that were decent, but this place knew what they were doing.

My only gripe was the service. I went on a Monday night when they were advertising a \"Corn Hole\" tournament that was supposed to start at 7pm. At 6:30 the place was kinda dead, so I asked the waitress (Brittany) if they still planned on having it, she said that they did....At 7:30 the place was still kinda dead, and I understand that they could probably not have it, but the waitress never bothered to tell me either way. All in all, she was not rude, but not very friendly either. I shouldn't complain too much as I've had worse service, but I can't afford to go out to eat everyday, so when I do go, I like to have my butt kissed, is that too much to ask? I'm there with my wife, smile, flirt with both of us, and have a conversation other than \"what can I get you\" and and you'll probably get a bigger tip, just saying...

Will I be back? For sure! I'm already telling my coworkers about the place. I look forward to trying everything off of their HUGE menu. The food is not \"cheap\" for bar food, but it doesn't taste like typical bar food either. And actually, after looking at some of their food specials online, it's not out of the question to get some unreal deals on the food, especially for as good as it tastes.

Also, just a tip to the owner (if he reads this)........This location has been like a restaurant/bar graveyard, and I hope that you succeed. But, I feel to do so, you gotta bring in better entertainment. The place is huge, don't waste it on \"cover bands\". I feel that the place is big enough to support some national \"small-medium\" sized acts, and I think there's a market for it."}

{"text":"I've heard very mixed reviews about this place, and I have to say my experience was not great. The food is pretty gross, even if it is \"bar food\" it's excessively greasy and little to no flavor. I got boneless wings and their chips. The service was pretty slow as well. It took about an hour to be in and out, and their were only a handful of people there. It seems like the owner is trying to figure out what he really wants the place to to be - a bar, nightclub, concert venue, family restaurant, community center, etc? But, for now they are trying to be all of these things and it's not working. 
I also tried to solicit their help with a fundraiser with Kent State, I thought trying to help a local business in the town I grew up in would be nice, and it would be nothing but beneficial to them as they would gain new business with college students (and we all know college students love bars right?!) I spoke to the bartender and I think she honestly threw my phone number away the minute I walked out. It could've been a really good opportunity and it could be a really nice business in Streetsboro, but it's just not"}
{"text":"From out of town & read reviews on Yelp so I thought I would give place a try.  Big mistake - 1/3 lb burger was awful!  Chili was pretty good but nothing special.  Big place looks like it could be fun with a big nite crowd but very disappointed in food."}
