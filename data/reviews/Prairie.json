{"text":"Food 4/5 stars Service 2/5 stars  My husband and I ate here during Pittsburgh's Winter 2016 Restaurant week.  Overall, I was pleased with the food.  I had a winter salad, which was delicious, as well as the chicken and biscuit.  The chicken was cooked excellently - very juicy.  The biscuit was a little dry for my taste, but the accompanying hash was delicious.  The dessert was solid as well - an ice cream sandwich.  Where Prairie falls short is their service.  It took a while (10-12 minutes) for someone to come to the table to ask us if we wanted water.  Additionally, the waitress didn't introduce herself and seemed almost caught off guard that we had been seated in her section.  Things overall moved very slowly, despite the restaurant being about 1/2-2/3 full.  That said, the food was enjoyable, but I probably won't go out of my way to eat here again due to the slow service."}
{"text":"After eating there a third time, I can say I won't be going back. The first two times I had brunch and the server was incredibly friendly but the food took much too long for a restaurant with only 3 tables to serve. I came away from the third meal there pretty frustrated that a restaurant would sell what was store bought vegan sausage and roll as a 'grilled seitan hoagie' but much worse charge $13 for it. If the chef or restaurant aren't willing to cook a vegetarian dish they should probably not offer a vegetarian option."}
{"text":"Nice dinner. Drinks were great (weekend slush and their version of a moscow mule). Prices reasonable. Service really great. A nice neighborhood destination."}
{"text":"Prior reviews were somewhat mixed, but we found the restaurant to be excellent. Between us we had salad, Mac and cheese appetizer, a fish main 2 desserts and drinks. Everything was excellent. The salad was as fresh as can be. The fish was fresh and perfectly cooked. All the dishes had a unique twist on traditional American cooking. The restaurant is bright and comfortable. The wait staff were very attentive."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for a dinner with some girlfriends. Our waitress was so knowledgable about the food and gave great recommendations. Two of us ordered the prairie burger, and two of us ordered the turkey sandwich. The burger was pretty good, and the turkey sandwich was even better. Don't let the \"rehydrated tomato\" on the turkey sandwich throw you off- it was delicious, kind of like a sun dried tomato spread. We also got the cornbread which was very yummy. Happy hour is 5-7 so get there early for the $6 wine!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for an indoor or outdoor experience.  Lots of food and drink options including vegan and gluten free. But also didn't hold back on amazing delicious carbs, cheese and meat! We really enjoyed the mocktails!"}
{"text":"They don't allow outdoor seating for a group of more than 4. So, if you have more than 4 friends, and you would like to enjoy outdoor dining in Pittsburgh summer, forget about it."}
{"text":"I am pleased with Prairie!  I loved Verde, but Prairie is a nice addition to the neighborhood.  The menu is great - plenty of options without being over the top.  I thought the prices were reasonable - no different than any other new restaurant in the city.  The cocktails were creative and very good.  Our meal was wonderful, and we topped it off with a cookie and milk.  Service was great.  We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Atmosphere is really nice, our waitress was bubbly and friendly. I could eat another serving of the potatoes.. Realllly good."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. I had lunch here today. Sadly, we were the only patrons the entire time but I chalk that up to this area not really being a lunch hotspot. Anyways, I had the seitan hoagie and it was really good. Their fries were good. The staff was nice and (obviously) very available. I hope more people check this place out because it is already many marks above Verde in my opinion. Despite (I think) the same management, this place might be a better fit."}
{"text":"I went to Prairie with my friend after her pal raved about the place. As we walked in, I quickly realized we'd entered a hipster paradise. The servers are wearing flannels and jeans, the dinner menu is called \"supper\" and the decor easily could have been done by the set designer of Girls. Not necessarily my scene but whatever. We had come on a Friday during restaurant week so weren't able to get a table. No big deal, there was tons of room at the bar so we saddled up on two empty stools.   There were 2 bartenders working the area. The one who waited on us was friendly, knowledgeable and aggressively hipster. I ordered a draft IPA which I liked even though at $7 I thought it was kind of on the pricey side. My friend ordered some bourbon cocktail which took several minutes of theatrical preparation to make (fire, smashing rosemary, stir, shake, something I'm sure they'd describing as \"melding\"...a truly eye rolling performance). She was pleased with her drink though. The service from the start was SLOW. We waited a bit for our drinks and even longer to order food. In fact, my friend wouldn't let me talk and made me stare at the bartenders with her until they finally took our order. Kind of an extreme measure to have to take to get service when the bar only seats around 20.  For food, I ordered the grown-up grilled cheese and my friend ordered from the prix fixe menu that was being featured for restaurant week. It was suggested I get my main course with my friend's 2nd course and I agreed. The portions for the prix fixe menu are described as \"generous.\"   So, my friend's 1st course arrives after about 30 mins. She'd ordered brussel sprouts and cheese. She is relatively underwhelmed by the dish but inhales the small portion because we'd been working all day and are getting progressively drunker.   Another 35 mins pass and her 2nd course and FINALLY my meal arrives. I should not have waited until her 2nd course for my food., whatever, I'll take some of the blame for this. Her 2nd course is a paltry serving of a mushroom and rice dish. She is dissatisfied with the dish and of course still starving because she's yet to receive a \"generous\" or even adequate serving of anything. For my part, I will say my grown-up G-Chi was good. It had apples on it, I liked it. At $11, it was one of the few things on the menu that I thought was priced somewhat appropriately. Meal is done. Plates are cleared. We go back to waiting.   My friend orders an irish coffee to help pass the time. This is not a uncommon item to order at a bar and we expect this to be a simple request. We were mistaken. After way too long, the bartender brings over a black coffee, cream and sugar. We ask each other, what do we think is about to happen here. She sits in front of this coffee for about 5 minutes. Then he brings over two shots of liquors to mix into the coffee because he knows \"how specific people are about their coffee so this way she can just mix it to her liking.\" She is charged for two shots and a coffee. She promptly dumps both shots in the coffee and after a mutual huff, she downs it.   My friend had a 3rd course as part of her order that we're waiting on, Seeing all of our fellow bar patrons come in, sit, eat, pay and leave. We've been here for over 2 hours at this point. Eventually we are the only people left at the bar. The bartender comes over, looking to clear us out, and asks if we plan on getting dessert or want to settle up. I say, \"well, she already did order dessert...\" bartender replies \"oh, do you want me to go out back and beat somebody up for not bringing it out yet?\" We kind of laugh and are like no, not necessary and then promptly say to each other what the f*** is going on right now. First of all there is no apology and second of all IT'S YOUR JOB, BARTENDER, likely to prepare the dessert or at least to figure out what's going on...like you should have check on that a full hour ago. So the dessert comes out another 15 minutes after this awful interaction. At the start of this debacle of a meal, the bartender made this whole thing about let us know if you have any allergies or food restrictions, we can totally honor those. My friend mentions she can only have small amounts of milk products. Her dessert arrives with heaping amounts of whipped cream on it. I'm not sure what else we expected at this point. She mentions it to the bartender who is just kind of like \"oh yeah, sucks to suck, I guess.\" We are the last people in the place, finally pay our pricey tabs and leave. There is NO verbal acknowledgement of the horrific service we received, no discount on the check. Had we been more confrontational patrons who'd expected even a minuscule amount of quality service, we would have asked to speak to a manager. In fact even debated it before we decided we just wanted to leave.   It was bad. This restaurant needs to be taken to a Prairie and humanely euthanized. Whatever they're trying to do here...it's just not work."}
{"text":"I Thought this place was great. Ambiance was really cool, with indoor and outdoor seating options. food was great across the board. Went for a Mother's Day brunch and the pecan French toast was killer. Everything we ordered was actually great, which is saying something in and of itself. Menu is a bit limited but at least what they list is actually delicious. Service was good too. Also, exceptionally good coffee for a restaurant. They accommodated our toddler quite well too. We had a reservation and they had the high chair set up when we arrived. They were Chic but also quite family friendly.  Great spot overall."}
{"text":"While I thought the restaurant was somewhat overpriced, I liked Prairie. I got one of the entrees off their Valentine's Day menu, the sausage pasta with kale, and it was good! The dish was a little heavy on the kale, but otherwise it was delicious. Their ice cream trio was fantastic and the chocolate ice cream had a spicy kick to it. While the service was friendly, I thought they were a little on the slow side. Overall, I liked Prairie, but I don't know if the food and drinks were worth it for the price."}
{"text":"Drinks are pretty good, food is pretty much comparable to Verde, pretty bland.  I had a burger which was not anything to write home about.  Probably wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Prairie for our anniversary dinner and we had a great time. We've been longtime fans of Verde and were sad when the restaurant closed. After reviewing Prairie's menu, though, I thought it would be worth trying. Since I'm a huge fan of bourbon, I figured I'd at least enjoy the cocktails. The food is very tasty and fresh. I'm a vegetarian and I was really happy with the available options. I had the mushroom and pea risotto and it was delicious. It is pricey, but there was a lot of it, so I had enough for a second meal. Overall, I'm not upset about the price. My husband went for the $7 burger special. He said it was good but nothing really impressive and that the burger was a tad overcooked. On the plus side, we both loved our cocktails (I had the Bourbon Fire--amazing!--and he had an Old Fashioned). The drinks were tasty and the bourbon is great quality, as you'd expect. Our server was very lovely and checked on us throughout the night. We mentioned that it was our anniversary, and she ended up surprising us with a slice of chocolate cake on the house! That was incredibly sweet and unexpected. Overall, we had a great time at Prairie and would certainly visit again."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not great. Expensive.   We went here during restaurant week and I'm so glad that's when we went, and not for the full-price menu. The restaurant week price was $30.16 per person but I think my selections would have been around $40 at regular price. Between me and my husband, we got the two squash soup, chicken and biscuit, Great Lakes walleye, bourbon bread pudding and the creme brûlée. Soup was thick, like a puree, but it was tasty. $8 is steep for a vegetarian soup though. The chicken dish was prepared well but way too oversalted, but the biscuit was flaky and buttery. The walleye itself was prepared perfectly but paired with the earthy wild rice, cauliflower and beets, I'm not sure if the flavors complimented each other very well. Too many earthy flavors took away from the fresh, flaky fish, which should have been the star of the show. The bread pudding was dry, as if it was a loaf of bread with just a drizzle of honey and cinnamon. The creme brûlée was decent, but a little too much lemon flavor. You can see the granules of vanilla bean but couldn't taste any of it with the overwhelming lemon flavor. Overall, I would come back if the prices dropped. Otherwise, it's just a bit too expensive for what you're getting."}
{"text":"This is a $30 per person restaurant serving food and drinks that are more along the lines of $20 per person. While I had a good meal there, I don't feel the urge to come back. My pork was prepared nicely with just a hint of pink, but there were so many other things on the plate that it got lost. They all tasted fine, however there was so much happening that it felt like a bit of a mess. My house cocktail too wasn't particularly balanced. It was an expensive meal without the level of quality I'd expect from similarly priced restaurants in the city. The interior is nice, service staff are friendly, and the menu treats vegetarians well. My dining companions and I agreed: were it just a bit cheaper, we'd gladly go back. As it stands now, there are too many better options."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for Restaurant week. While I had planned to order something different than him, they changed the menu from what was posted online, so I couldn't order what I had planned. I was a little disappointed about that but ordering the same thing meant we could both get a good idea about the dish and discuss.  We had the campfire mac and cheese to start. It was thick and creamy. I liked that they used cavatappi instead of shells or elbow macaroni. It's just such a fun noodle and really held on to the thick sauce. The bacon was a little crispier than I expected, but it was good. The onions also provided a nice crunch and broke up some of the rich cheese sauce.  The chicken and biscuit entree was really good. I liked the thick gravy and the evenly diced root vegetables. The beets and carrots went really well together. We noticed big differences in the size of our biscuits, and both thought they were a little dry. I reheated half of my food for lunch later and thought that warming up the biscuit actually made it seem better and less dry. The chicken was really moist. It was well seasoned, and we both liked that it was deboned. I expected to cut into it and have to pick meat off the bone but there was only the little wing drumstick at the end, so that made things easier.   Dessert was where we differed. My boyfriend ordered the cookie and ice cream, which was really good. The huge cookie looked a little silly with such a tiny scoop of ice cream, but it tasted good. I ordered the lemon thyme creme brulee, which I loved. The lemon and thyme went really good together and mixed things up a bit from a typical super sweet creme brulee.   I think that the food was good, but with their normal prices, seems a little over priced. Drinks were really the shining point of dinner. We each had one of their happy hour little mules, which defintiely have a spicier ginger flavor than most mules, and I love that. He had the blackberry gin fizz and I had the Prairie fire, which we didn't get to see made but I saw made previously and they actually light the rosemary sprig on fire when making the drink.  Service was good and our waitress was really friendly. The space is really nice, though my boyfriend found their chairs a little uncomfortable. I love the look o the bar and the whiskey posters they have. I'd probably go back for drinks and because I really want to try the beer cheese bread bowl, but I'm not sure I'd be back for a full meal."}
{"text":"I've been to Prairie twice now--once for a Valentines friends date and once for brunch with a friend visiting from NC. Overall, Prairie didn't overwhelm me, but it did have its highlights--namely, the butternut squash soup that I was able to enjoy for my February dinner (I even tried to recreate it at home shortly afterwards, but it just wasn't the same)."}
{"text":"Okay so I just have to say that I was bummed to hear that Verde closed, but it turns out that it actually just turned into Prairie! I visited Prairie last night and although it was generally a place I would recommend, there were a few things that made me miss Verde.  Hits:  -Vegetarian options!  -The flavors of all of the savory dishes were amazing and the lil' mule I had was also delicious (but also seemed smaller than expected.) It was cheaper than the usual mule, but proportionately smaller in size.  I had a vegetarian noodle and sausage dish that resembled a more refined, delicious stroganoff. We also had a beer cheese dip that was devoured.  -Service was really good and the staff seemed to be knowledgable about their new menus. -Restaurant has a cool atmosphere and vibe without feeling too stuffy or inaccessible.    Misses:  -Most importantly- the carrot cake with yogurt icing tasted like carrot cake with butter icing. Massive amounts of butter flavored icing. I was so excited to see this huge piece of cake coming to our table, but boy was I sad and disappointed to taste butter instead of frosting. I think it's supposed to be frosting, but it tastes like what I would imagine a buttercream with almost no sugar would taste like. Everything about that slice was great (the cake itself, the orange glaze, the size, etc) besides the butter that it was slathered in.  -The beer cheese dip was also runny and hard to eat because it's served in a bread bowl that you have to cut or tear apart in order to dip the bread in the cheese.   Overall, the restaurant was comfortable and visually appealing, had great service, generally good food, but I honesty don't know when I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere 4/5 Food 4/5 Cocktails 3/5 Mocktails 2/5 Service 4/5  Pleasantly surprised  by the nice ambiance (lots of windows and hanging lights) of the place. Service was excellent aside from the very end when we had to ask for the check after a long wait.  Drinks: Both our guys ordered the old fashioned. It was good, but not great. Station does it better. Mocktails: Us girls tried one of each (the R&B? and the Not in Kansas anymore). I like the R&B slightly better, however both were very sour, neither of us finished the drink.  Appetizers: We very much enjoyed the cheese board ($14) which easily satisfied the 4 of us sharing it, wish there was slightly more bread/crackers tho. We also loved the corn break which comes with a flavored butter. However, the cornbread at Porch is better if not cheaper.  Veggie perspective: food is generally veggie friendly with at least two sandwiches and two mains that were veggie/vegan friendly. I incredibly enjoyed the seitan hoagie which was HUGE (I took the other half home) with tasty good quality seitan sausage and spread on a generous and buttered bun. If you get a side, ask for the house salad (it is divine!, delicious endive/frisee with the most amazing light dressing, beets, and cheese, my favorite part of the meal).  My husband enjoyed the steak ($26) however said the meat could have been a better cut for the price. It was perfectly cooked to what he asked for.  Dessert: We had the vegan apple crisp which is diced apples with granuola/crumble on top. Not great, probably wouldn't order again.  People complain about the price. It is pricey for what it is, which I would say a fancier version of \"Porch\". Splitting the check for 4 people who had a drink each, 2 appetizers, an entree each, and 1 dessert it was more than $35 a person without tip.   Staff were very attentive during the majority of our meal and were lovely enough to realize it was my husband's birthday and dessert came out with a candle on top. We absolutely appreciated that detail. However, we ended up waiting around for 20 minutes after dessert and having to flag someone down to get the waitress to split our check.   Will probably return again for a date night but this probably won't be  a favorite hang out."}
{"text":"We went for New Years brunch.  I made reservations to pad my Open Table account, but we really didn't need them at 11 am.    True to form, we were the first and only table for only a few minutes.    The brunch menu is limited, but has some great ideas including the steak and eggs, which my friend got.  The steak was cooked to medium rare, although the server never asked, but it was pretty much to perfection.  I had the reuben quiche which was not on the menu, but the New year special.  They had a specialty drink called \"Hangover punch\" which was quite boozy, but I get it.  All of the portions were just enough, not the gluttonous portions that make you feel like you have to eat all of it.   Our service was great and we were out of there in an hour (good turnaround time for brunch)"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian dishes. One of the best cheese boards in Pittsburgh, and one that showcases regional cheeses. Wonderful salads and soups. My risotto was delicious.  I think the the food is great but slightly overpriced.   The wine list is limited, but there's some great choices in whiskey."}
{"text":"I ordered the cheese plate and the salad. The cheeses were very hard, almost like a hunk of parmesan, and came with these quite odd cheese twists that were rather unappealing.   The salad was decent, though hardly notable. It had \"omega cheeses,\" which is a type of cheese that neither google nor wikipedia seems to have heard of (I think it was blue cheese or gorgonzola).   There were also candied pecans in both the salad, the cheese plate and the cookie we got for dessert. It appears that Prairie buys candied pecans from Trader Joe's and then sprinkles it on most of their dishes. Very odd."}
{"text":"Went to Prairie just after it opened, was pleasantly surprised! Plenty of brunch options and good service, comfortable and relaxed atmosphere. There are multiple vegetarian options and everything we ordered came out hot and fresh. There aren't as many brunch options on Penn ave near Bloomfield so Prairie is a great addition"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Prairie.  I need to return on Mondays to see what their Nashville style hot chicken is like.  The cocktail menu is great. They have a nice variety of cocktails for every taste. The pricing seemed in line with the rest of Pittsburgh at $10 or so for a cocktail.  The food was astounding. I really liked the Mac and cheese. The pasta was well prepared and there was a balanced amount of cheese.  I had the steak. The steak was good though the sauce and potatoes on the side were better than the steak.  We had the cookie & ice cream and the bread pudding. The cookie desert was good. The bread pudding was better."}
{"text":"Overall, despite a team of good servers and bartenders, the restaurant was sub par and not worth the rather high prices.  We will not be coming here again.   The Prairie Fire cocktail was heavy on the Green Chartreuse and smelled strongly of something off-putting (per my wife, \"like an old sneaker\").  The old fashioned and sazerac were fine.  The brussels sprouts were under seasoned and bland, though it was a generous portion.  Unlike many brussels sprouts starters, it was not fried or roasted to the point of being blackened, which made it fairly light.  The ribeye was flavorless and chewy, as well as cold and poorly cooked (mostly from being grilled before letting the steak come to room temperature, I would guess).  The chicken similarly lacked in flavor, but was cooked well, though the biscuits contained an overbearing amount of rosemary and tasted strongly of raw flour.   The bourbon bread pudding was good, probably the best thing we had, but of the ice cream trio (rose water, pistachio, and chocolate), only the rose water scoop was enjoyable.  The pistachio flavor was too weak, the chocolate too strong.  The restaurant decor was pleasant and the staff was friendly.  The service was generally quite good."}
{"text":"I went with a friend for restaurant week and enjoyed my meal. The last time I went to a restaurant week dinner, it was at Root 174, and I did not like it at all. I remember feeling that the menu they put together was a complete after thought. A bummer because I heard a lot of great things about the place, but it totally fell short for me.  I did get a chance to view Prairie's menu prior to going and I thought it was more thoughtful and offered a range of different dishes for vegetarians, pescatarians and omnivores alike. The waitstaff was great. I actually was delayed getting there, but called them while en route and they assured me they'd save my table. And true to their word, when we arrived, we were promptly seated.  I ordered the winter salad, the walleye fish and the crème brulée. My friend had the brussel sprouts, the chicken breast, and I believe the rhubarb cake. I really enjoyed the winter salad and the walleye. The walleye was moist and flaky with a nice crisp skin. That was the standout dish for me. The crème brulée was fine, didn't find it stellar. It was more than an ample serving. I remember not being able to finish it.  For cocktails, we both ordered the little mule. Didn't realize it was going to be so little, but it was a solid drink, hands-down.  I'm glad Prairie has taken over its predecessor Verde, another restaurant that I didn't care for and had eaten there more than a handful of times. Prairie is very promising. Felt that I got my money's worth from the restaurant week menu, let's see if it holds up going forward."}
{"text":"Good but not great.  The food was hit or miss. Hits were the burgers (I didn't get one but those at our table who did loved them) and the gingerbread dessert (deep ginger flavor and nice accompaniments).  Misses were the appetizer (brussels sprouts were way too salty), the pasta entree (small portion and not memorable flavors), and a so-so turkey sandwich (great stuff inside but so greasy).  Drinks were similarly hit or miss: cocktails were intriguing and tasty but the prices for 1 oz pours of whiskeys (or mezcals, for that matter) were so high as to be a turn-off.  I really enjoyed Verde and wanted to like Prairie too but was underwhelmed.  Too many flaws to continue being a destination for us..."}
{"text":"I was actually not a huge fan of Verde, but I just had brunch at Prairie, and I really really liked it.  My wife and older child had the 2 squash soup which I sampled, and it was really great.  I don't normally even like squash soup.  I had a salad with fennel and citrus, and it was so well done.  It is rare that I see a properly seasoned salad presented to me.  This one was perfect.  My hot chicken was awesome, I love that they used pickled onion instead of a pickle slice.  My younger son devoured his french toast, and my wife loved her vegetarian biscuits and gravy.  The service was good and attentive.    There are a ton of great restaurants in the East End.  There are however a limited number of really great brunch places.  E2 in Highland Park, Square Cafe, Union Pig and Chicken (surprising but great) etc.  Add this one to the list.  There are to be sure other great places to go for standard diner food--really awesome diner food, Pamelas, even Ritter's.  It is nice to have another place for brunch that offers something other than omelets and pancakes (nothing wrong with either--love em both)."}
{"text":"just like Verde overpriced and slow service. Sorry 15 dollars for a hamburger and 13 dollars for a martini? It's garfield, not Tribecca. Salt was less expensive. My go to place for good food and drink is Plum.  I gave Prairie 2 more tries. Tonight I write it off as a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I usually wouldn't eat at a place like this, just because (in my opinion) there isn't really anything special about American cuisine. I was with a friend that wanted to try it out, so we attended brunch. I had eggs over porkbelly and lentils. It was good, but nothing that makes me so addicted that I wanted to come back. The staff needs some more training. Even though there were only two tables occupied, the staff acted quite unprofessional."}
{"text":"4.5 stars, truly. Chose to check out Prairie for a date night during Restaurant Week since my better half tends to prefer homier food and a relaxed atmosphere and because...whiskey. All these things were promised to me on Prairie's (well-designed) website and delivered in spades.  I really, really enjoyed my meal.  I had the two squash soup to start. Honestly, I don't really love squash but I do love soup so I wasn't sure about my order. Ended up loving it. It's very thick, almost a puree, but I think that adds to the decadent feel. Flavor was spot on and the toppings really enhanced the dish - just the right amount of fried leaks to add texture and olive oil to add a luxurious depth of flavor. And those croutons nestled into the soup were hands-down the best croutons ever. Can those become a menu item? Just kidding...sort of.  For an entree I chose the sprouted rice and mushrooms. I cannot get over how perfect the texture of the sprouted rice was - slightly chewy but still creamy. Yum! There were various types of mushrooms that leant a lovely earthy, meaty flavor to the dish. Sautéed kale was mixed in for the sake of greens. A lightly dressed arugula salad atop the dish offered a light/fresh component to give the palette a break from the rich thickness of the dish, making it so that I could clean my plate! Only thing I didn't care for were the couple thin slices of grapefruit atop the salad, just wasn't necessary and the bitter flavor didn't go with the rest of the dish. That is a nitpick though. I would absolutely order the dish again.   My dining bro chose the Campfire Mac n Cheese to start. I had a bite and loved the smoky flavor. After damn near licking the bowl clean, hubby announced \"Finally, someone understands that Mac n Cheese needs a little spice\" I don't know what the spice was, but apparently it was essential! He had chicken and biscuit for his main course, which he enjoyed. I tasted the biscuit and it was a tad dry but nothing some delicious, thick gravy couldn't fix!   Dessert fell a little flat. I liked that the bourbon bread pudding wasn't too sweet and the whipped cream on top was homemade and really delicious. Unfortunately it was overall a little dry...a small drizzle of caramel sauce or something would have helped. My husband had the cookie and ice cream. Cookie was warm and had chunks of dark chocolate, pretty tasty. He must have liked the ice cream because i didn't get a taste ;) I probably wouldn't order dessert again, but I'm also not a huge dessert person so this really doesn't detract from my experience or likelihood to enjoy another meal here!  Drinks were right up my alley. I had the Penn Pal (more or less a Manhattan) - rye whiskey, good vermouth, and heavy on the Campari. It was just slightly over-bitter and I. LOVE. THAT. I wanted to order something different for my second drink, but I had to have another Penn Pal. Got to sample the Woodford Lil' Mule, which is their take on a Moscow Mule. Made with bourbon (yes, please!) and with a stronger ginger flavor than most mules. You definitely have to like bourbon and ginger to enjoy this one. I think it's a great twist on the classic. Drinks were so on point for our tastes that we would probably come back solely for drinks and a shared appetizer.  Maybe it's odd to mention, but I find their logo to be very calming and inviting. Whoever designed it should be congratulated.   Looking forward to returning in the near future to see what else Prairie has to offer. The gentleman dining next to us said his burger was excellent and that the fries were perfectly seasoned (think I can guess what my hubby will order next time). Oh, and once Pittsburgh thaws for the summer there is some killer patio space to be enjoyed :)"}
{"text":"Prairie, if you can hear me...  embrace that comfort food and let it be comfortable.  I know its only been a few weeks and I hope you can find your groove.  Your cocktails are great and your potential is high, you've proven that you have it in you.  I know you're new and finding your identity beyond the old Verde.  So go find that chicken and that cookie that you left across the street at restaurant week and put it on the menu!"}
{"text":"I loved Verde but Prairie is more my style of food- my friend and I shared the corn bread, the sausage pasta dish, and my FAVE, the Brussel sprout bacon app.  The Prairie Fire cocktail was delicious and a perfect pairing for this style of cuisine.  I don't usually eat dessert but couldn't resist the espresso cake and ice cream.  Our server, Kristina was the best, she and the entire staff were super attentive and helpful.  Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"The food was decent but I agree with the other posters that it's a bit pricey. Drinks were tasty but I think they still have some kinks to work out. For instance we started with the cornbread that was supposed to come with apple butter, but instead it seemed like we got regular butter with a little cinnamon sprinkled in. The two squash was tasty and I had the Seiten hoagie which was good, but not great. The portion sizes of the sandwiches were large so you could easily share.   My friend wanted the turkey sandwich but they refused to substitute  the cheese for the cheddar in the grilled cheese which I thought was odd. If you have both cheeses, what difference does it make which sandwich it goes on?! side of fries was plentiful and well seasoned but could have been a bit warmer and crispier. Out of our four person party we were all satisfied but no one really raved about their meal.   I'd go back to try their main entrees. I was impressed with the options on the menu-- glad to see some changes from the traditional fare."}
{"text":"Meh really sums up our dinner at Prairie. Upon arrival we were offered basically the worst seat in the house, literally crammed behind the hostess station and next to the water service station. We asked to move to one of the two other open two-tops, and the hostess was just plain annoyed with us. We did move and the seat was fine but MAN are those crappy plastic chairs uncomfortable - I had to keep my feet planted because the chair was so slippery I could have slid right out of it. Our server was delightful and really helpful. The cocktails (whiskey sour) weren't more than a few sips, mostly a giant ice cube taking up space. The cheese board was the saddest cheese board I have ever seen - there were three pieces of cheese present, all of which were pretty much the same medium firmness and flavor profile. I'd tell you what they were but the app was dropped without any info about what the cheeses were. We were left to portion the cheeses to serve them with our butter knives.   Entrees - the steak was of middling quality and somewhat overdone. In no way was it an $28 entree. The meatloaf was fine but literally no better than a meatloaf you'd make at home. No jus was present on the plate which made the serving a little dry.   Dessert was far and away the best part of the meal. We almost left without ordering it and went somewhere else for dessert but it was raining so we stayed. The cake and ice cream and chocolate chip cookie were both really yummy.  Service 4/Food 2 (and way overpriced)/Atmosphere 2. All in all a 2.5."}
{"text":"My group of about ten friends visited Prairie for dinner on a Thursday for their $5 Casa Verde Margarita special. The margaritas were super tasty, a generous glass with a great balance of flavors. Our table shared the kettle corn basket and cheese board, which were big hits. I felt like eating light so I ordered the spring salad, which had a really refreshing and original mix of flavors like pickled root vegetables and radishes. Our server was really attentive, but I never felt rushed during the two hours we stayed.  While I really enjoyed my food and drinks at Prairie, I probably won't be back for dinner because nothing else on the menu is beckoning me to come back. Those are just my tastes though, so I would urge others to give Prairie a shot if they haven't already!"}
{"text":"I would define Prairie as good, but not great.  My biggest complaint is that I think they plated the rice before the salmon on my entree.  This meant that the salmon was hot but the rice was only lukewarm.  Otherwise, I thought everything had very good flavor.  The glaze on the salmon was delicious.  The ice cream trio dessert was really good, especially the chocolate, which had an unexpected spiciness to it.    I thought the service was average at best.  The waitress was not particularly attentive and seemed to disappear regularly.  I was thinking about getting a drink after dinner (they have an extensive list of whiskeys that looked appealing) but she brought the check without asking whether I was interested (and there were plenty of open tables so there was no need to rush us out)."}
{"text":"Thank God for Restaurant Week!  We found a true GEM!  Restaurant week has always been amazing for trying something new at an affordable price.  After hearing Prairie won most mouthwatering at the kick off party, I knew we had to try it.  I never heard of them... but they're new to the scene so that makes sense.   Formerly Verde, Prairie is full of comfort and joy in your mouth.  Our reservations allowed us to be seated immediately, which is good because within minutes of us entering, it was packed!  Promptly greeted and drinks were recommended - if you like Bourbon, you'll love Prairie!   Our RW menu selections were Brussel Sprouts, Mac N Cheese (apps); chicken and biscuit, mushroom sprouted rice risotto  (main); bourbon bread pudding, Prairie cookie with vanilla ice cream (dessert).  I cannot accurately describe the deliciousness we received.   I will say this - I want that recipe for the Brussels!  Also, I have dreamed of that cookie...  oh goodness... the warm chocolate pecan cookie was incredible!     When we learned they serve brunch, we KNEW that Prairie was added to our favorites list.  I cannot wait to try their full menu (which we looked at and sounds delicious and reasonably priced).   Most Mouthwatering?  Yes I concur!  Another successful restaurant week in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Hands-down, my favorite brunch in Pittsburgh. And I've eaten a LOT of them. Meat & Potatoes is good. Really good. Bar Marco, good. Lots are good, good, good. None compares to Prairie. Set over in Bloomfield, Prairie comes with no pretense. It's just easy from its atmosphere to its staff. Comfortable. And that's just as breakfast should be. But people. Let's dish about the food. HOLY. CATS. Amazing. On our last visit, I started with an American 75 (a lovely twist on the classic French 75--one of my favorite brunch elixirs), which was Applejack, Campari, ginger, lemon, cinnamon, and Prosecco. DELIGHTFUL. My kids had, respectively, an \"S&B Fizz\": house-made orgeat, lemon, lime, cream soda and the \"Not in Kansas Anymore,\" which was pineapple, vanilla, lemon, lime, and soda. Both seemed most impressed by their \"mocktails.\" One kid had the Farmer's Breakfast, which is the best presentation of the traditional American breakfast I've ever seen--eggs (he got scrambled), thick-cut bacon, fennel-apple sausage, fried potatoes, caramelized onions, and rye toast with cinnamon honey butter; the other had chicken and waffles that crossed her eyes for the rest of the day. I had steak and eggs--Denver Cut steak, beets (which I could have eaten a plate of all on their own), kale, cheddar cheese grits, and sunny side up eggs. Let's talk about how good this steak was. Tender perfection, this cow was clearly raised by angels and then cooked by unicorns who proceeded to bathe it in happiness. There is nothing over the top about Prairie. But everything they do is done to absolute perfection. Amazing food, amazing service, amazing amazingness. And we're going again this weekend. w00t!"}
{"text":"We had a certificate for a glass class and decided to stop by Prairie's HH. Props to the staff for not laughing at me struggling to open the wrong door (go in the one with the screen, away from the bar).  Prairie was pretty quiet at 5:30 on a Tuesday--there were only 3 other sets of customers. We opted to sit at the bar and the bartender was friendly without being overbearing, and she ensured that our every thirst was met (both water and booze).  I agree with the other reviewers--their regular menu is pretty pricy. We ordered two of the appetizers (sprouts and beer cheese) and the chicken and biscuit entree to go with our drinks. The happy hour special on a Moscow Mule (or 'lil mule, as it was called here) is tasty (nice and ginger-y!), affordable, and served in an actual copper cup that didn't require a deposit! Yay for trust! The sprouts were really tasty, although not as gratin-y as I would have expected--no bechamel, just breadcrumbs, cheese, bacon, and a bit of a lemony broth. I liked the lightened up version as a foil to the decadent beer cheese bread bowl. The beer cheese was pretty good, but a little grainy, and the sourdough boule really had excellent flavor that was covered up by the cheese. I'd rather the cheese be served on the side so I can enjoy the tasty bread more!  The chicken and biscuit entree was very large--two generous pieces of chicken, a ginormous biscuit, roasted beets (and possibly potatoes?), and thick brown gravy. We didn't finish this or the beer cheese given their size, so perhaps the higher prices would be good value for heartier eaters. The biscuit was pretty dense, but the beets were phenomenal, and went really well with the roasted chicken. Gravy was well-seasoned, but a little too gloppy for my preference.  Friendly service, tasty food, and excellent drinks--we'll probably come back for RW and happy hour. Food is pretty heavy on the current menu...curious to see what they'll do come spring!"}
{"text":"A very good restaurant. Their burger is incredible and would highly recommend to stop in and try it. The chili is to die for! Good cocktails and absolutely top of the line in service."}
{"text":"Great food. Great space. Great whiskey mules. And great service.   We just went to Prairie for the first time on a Monday night. Our group started with the bbq kettle corn; and I was tempted to just order more and make that my meal. I had the spicy chicken Monday night special (in part, because it came with a cookie) and my husband had the bacon wrapped bison meatloaf. Both were excellent. But the cookie sealed our love of the place. It's the best cookie I've experienced in the 'Burgh so far.   The cookie, plus some certain other baffling negative reviews, and my overall positive experience with the bites and service all prompted this review. It's not your new fancy and somewhat overpriced Lawrenceville spot, but maybe that's why I love it. We will be back with some frequency. This place deserves to have 4.5 stars, so I'm rounding up."}
{"text":"This place is pretty over priced for the small portion sizes.  We expected to at least have some leftovers but we ate everything we ordered and left hungry.  The two squash soup was delicious, the Brussel sprouts with bacon was good but served in a tiny croc, the mac and cheese was just okay.  I actually liked the fennel and apple pasta with sausage but again, it was such a small portion.  The walleye was good, but is oddly paired with a beet coulis and the rice and Cauliflower that was served  along with it was such a tiny amount.  I hope this place figures out that Pittsburghers don't like to pay for meals with very conservative portion sizes.  I doubt I'll go back but wish them luck since this place is located in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Didn't realize they closed from 3-5 to transition from brunch to dinner. Walked in at 2:45, was advised they was closing but would be willing to let us order. Waitress was very friendly and helpful. Ordered off the brunch menu  Food was fantastic and very fresh! Potatoes were thin, crispy and perfectly salted. The thick cut bacon was also super yummy. Def going back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Full Disclosure: we went for bruch, and so i never expect amazing- but this wasn't very good for what it was.  Positive: Service was VERY good, friendly and quick.  However, I had the two squash soup and winter salad.  The soup was super bland and I felt the need to ask for salt, until i tasted my salad- which may have had a 1/2 pound of salt on it.  Really not impressive for selection or taste.  With that said- I was a huge fan of Verde, so I may head back here to try a dinner.  But the chef really has some work to do."}
{"text":"For months, I've been dying to dine at Prairie, and I'm glad I finally made it here. From their menu online, I could see there were good vegetarian options which makes it a must-try. We came late on a Saturday evening, but the atmosphere was calm and relaxing. The waitress was very friendly and checked in on us often.   We ordered the cornbread as a starter. Overall, it tasted great: crispy on the outside, nice and fluffy on the inside. However, the jalapeño taste overpowered the rest of the flavors and made the cornbread spicier than I would have liked it to be. The green onions were an interesting touch. I was not a fan but my boyfriend loved it, so to each his own, I guess.  I chose the Seitan Hoagie as my entree, and it was delicious! The seitan itself could have used more flavor. Most of the favor came from the marinated vegetable topping. I was excited to try the cauliflower \"cheese\" but there was barely any on the sandwich to be able to taste it - disappointing :(   My boyfriend got the Prairie burger which tasted good except for the fact that the patty was unevenly cooked. He ordered it medium rare but the center looked like it was ripped right off the cow while the sides were too well done.   Even though it wasn't a completely smooth ride, I would still recommend trying out this place. It's vegetarian-friendly and the prices aren't too bad for the quality of food you get. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to Prairie opening and went during the first couple of weeks for Sunday brunch. The eggs, sausage and biscuits were delicious. Truly felt old west inspired as well as with the decor. Bloody Mary's had just the right kick."}
{"text":"My dinner at Prairie a few nights ago was a solid 3.5 stars.  The negative first: it's overpriced. In my opinion they should drop the price of every sandwich and entree by 2-3 dollars. I am not someone who has any qualms about a spendy meal, but the prices here seemed a bit excessive.  My boyfriend had a $15 seitan hoagie that was good, but not, you know, Spak-Brothers-Good. Also my fancy grilled cheese could have been fancier, and elevated by addition of another type of cheese or a few more veggies to make it a bit less Basic.  I like the fried sage on it, though, and the salad that came with it was super-yum.    I have to give Prairie huuuge props for their solid vegetarian selection!  When I heard about the concept, I figured it would be another meat-themed Pittsburgh restaurant that would have one vegetarian option and zero vegan options on the menu. How nice to be pleasantly surprised by a number of choices, and I do really want to go back and try some of the dinner entree items.    I am also impressed by the whiskey menu, the quality of the cocktails, and that there are good happy hour specials.  We had both the house mule and the old fashioned, and both were quite tasty and well-prepared.  Our dessert-- vegan apple crisp-- was delicious!!  Seamless service and a relaxing vibe ensures that we will be back soon."}
