{"text":"Lovely (albeit pricy) sushi. Service is quick, and I like that they are happy to let you have it 'to-go'. Free tea while you wait. Great handrolled cones, and the right amount of wasabi per piece."}
{"text":"I must say Tatami has the best Sushi I've ever tasted. I can't believe anybody would think differently. A great restauraunt with an excellent Sushi Chef. This reastaurant is one of a kind!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the mid-star ratings... I live in the area and find it fresh and well made."}
{"text":"Agree food quality is suspect.  Soggy oily tempura, scary fish quality.  Remarkably bad."}
{"text":"We went for Sushi on a weekday night. Place was quiet, staff friendly, atmosphere was nice. The location really can't be beat.  The sushi was excellent. In-line with other great spots around the city. I like that they serve mostly sushi, unlike many of these sushi-fusion-asian hybrids which are all over the place. Everything was fresh, we had two specialities a l'erable and geisha, which were unique.  Pricing is what you would see at any sushi restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if all sushi in Montreal is bad but I can't understand how this place gets 3 stars. This was the worst \"sushi\" I've ever had. I've had better sushi at Shop Rite. We ordered the sushi for 2 which started out with really greasy pumpkin, sweet potato and shrimp tempura. It only got worse from there. The \"sushi\" is mostly a mix of fillers such as imitation crab to cover up the lack of actual fish.  We were not the only ones who shared that opinion since the girl at the next table was arguing with the woman (presumably the owner? ) telling her \"this is not sushi\" and made them bring her something else. I would not recommend this place to anyone who likes sushi. It's simply way overpriced for low quality food."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have every found anywhere, but definitely Montreal.  The sushi is inventive with a great variety of interesting rolls.  One of the best parts of the restaurant experience is the plate presentation.  The restaurant uses a lot of cut flowers, herbs and fruit/vegetables to make each entree special.  I'm always interested in seeing the presentation when I go.    The restaurant is very accessible to Old Montreal and is on Place d'Armes and on the same block as Notre Dame Cathedral so it's hard to miss.    One of the coolest things is the that most of the tables are aquariums with tropical salt water fish in them.... so you are eating directly on a piece of glass on top of the aquarium.    If you're touring Old Montreal and have a sushi craving, you won't be disappointed in this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best hidden gems.  I've traveled in and around Japan a few times and had great food and this restaurant rivals the very best in Japan. if you are a student looking for all you can eat sushi, this isn't the place for you.  On the other hand if you are a discerning pallet with a desire for exceptional exotic gastronomy then,  you will experience nirvana."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Monday with a friend. We decided to try some sushi because there are not many sushi places in Quebec City. We were seated promptly. One thing I found odd were the tables. It was a piece of glass placed on top of an empty aquarium. I do not know how often they clean the aquariums but there was some algae overgrowth. This did not bode well for sanitary eating conditions. Anyway, I ordered the bento box. It contained rice, Asian salad, a few pieces of California rolls, and chicken teriyaki. The food was bland and not very tasty. The only positive was that the food came out relatively quick for lunch time. Also, my little bowl for the soy sauce was very dusty. I don't think they wash the dishes that well. You should order a hot tea to re-wash your dishes."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant valait le détour il y a quelques années, mais ce n'est plus le cas maintenant. Sushis trop chers pour ce que c'est, faible présentation, et le thon rouge etait plutôt brun. pas de Sake en stock bien qu'il y avait 5 choix sur la carte des vins. Sushi shop est meilleur et moins cher."}
{"text":"Nice light sushi. Not overwhelmed with rice. Amazing service. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Sushi are delicious but extremely overpriced. We ordered just 4 rolls and 4 beers and out total bill was 130!!!"}
{"text":"Decent place. Was in town on business travel and went to dinner with some co-workers. I enjoyed all of the rolls (we ordered 8 rolls for the table of 4) and the presentation was delightful."}
{"text":"Good food dragged down by terrible service and high prices.  I had the ninja combo which was good but overpriced for what it turned out to be.  I had to remind the waitress for my drink.  No offer of a refill. Doesn't take Amex and at these prices?   No wonder the place is only 10% full."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bit to eat after my friend and I finished up at the Notre-Dame.   Upon entering, I was super excited to see that there was a large fish tank in the front and fish tanks as the support for every table... COOL. My excitement was soon shattered when I found out that all of the tanks were empty, and had no fish in them, just water.   For actual food, this place was decent. My chicken teriyaki and miso soup was pretty good, and well presented. In addition, this place gets kudos for having a very reasonably priced prix fix lunch menu option.   Service was just OK. We changed waitresses several times and was never entirely sure who was actually helping us. There was a minor mix up with my friends order and she received a salad instead of soup, but it was not a major deal breaker.  Overall, a good place to go after seeing the Notre-Dame and a very good value."}
{"text":"The sushi here is pedestrian. Really basic stuff. Tempura seems to be their gimmick."}
{"text":"Miso soup was good. Some rolls were good. Fish quality was suspect...  Decor needed some work. That could easily be remedied to make this a nice place. Was drafty by the window - needs more heat.   Not very full. Service was polite and punctual. Convenient location for tourist spots like Notre dame."}
{"text":"Regretfully, I haven't eaten in here yet, but due to the proximity of this fab little sushi spot to my office, I often get take-out for latenight work sessions.  First off, the presentation.  I know it's supposed to be function over form, but the extra care the itamae put into the preparation truly shows.      Secondly, and more importantly, the fish is fresh, no one ingredient overpowers the other, and it all comes together well.    I look forward to dinner pickup at least one night of each trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"A friend I was with really wanted some sushi for dinner so we decided to try this place out.  We both ordered a couple of rolls.  The rolls were okay and tasty, but I would have expected more from a place that boasts such inventive flavor combinations.  I think some of this was that when I normally order a specialty roll somewhere its bigger, but the special rolls were still tiny little rolls, just like any other simple standard roll you might order.  The service was decent. This place would be good if you're in the area and you need a quick fix, but I wouldn't seek this place out for a good sushi experience."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst experience I've had in a while.  Not only does Tatami boast inventive sushi with a tropical atmosphere, they have a seemingly reliable location in the Old Port of Montreal. What could go wrong?  First of all, I'm sure that the sushi chef measures his rolls with a toonie. The rolls are small, mushy and they fall apart upon first contact with chop sticks. When you order, be prepared to get half of your meal. Only when I received my 8 out of 16 pieces was I told that they have run out of such things as avocado and scallop. I had to ask to order something else when the waitress looked at me with a blank stare.  This brings me to service. You know that charming man with the squeegee  as you get off the Ville Marie? He beats these people ten fold in the service department. Having to ask for a menu, a glass of water and then to order more sushi because I wasn't told in advance that they have run out of \"fundamentals\" is unacceptable and lazy service. Then, to add insult to injury,  the bill took over 20 minutes to settle.  And you know those \"salt water tanks\" tables? They are fishless and assume all of the legroom leaving diners to sit sideways.  Sometimes, I can forget about terrible service when I'm saturated in a perfect meal- in this case, I'm trying to forget about the whole thing.  Go somewhere else to spend a fortune. This isn't worth it."}
{"text":"We arrived in Montreal tired and hungry and with a kid.  Did not have a lot of patience to look for a restaurant. We saw sushi and everyone agreed that was fine.  We walked in at 6pm and were the only ones in the restaurant, yet it still took 15 minutes to order.  2 more tables came in and we waited for 45 minutes for some sushi and a small appetizer. We were so frustrated because the restaurant was empty. There was really no reason the food should have taken so long.  The vegetable tempura consisted of 3 pieces of sweet potato and a carrot, the Gyoza came from a box.  Both items were saturated with oil and basically unedible.  The sushi was fine yet the fish was sliced paper thin and we had to ask for ginger and soy sauce.  It was not inexpensive either!  When all was said and done we walked out still hungry , frustrated and from the prices felt robbed!  I would stay away!!!!"}
{"text":"An incredibly bad \"Japanese\" rest. that included a meal that was impossible to finish.  It started off with powdered miso shiro soup that included fake crab.  The rolls were definitely pre-made causing the seaweed to stretch like rubber-- this only happens when the seaweed is on rice for a long time.  A lot of mayo in the rice- really bad.  Most of the rolls had a lot of the fake crab in them for volume, had little/no taste, and the fish...something wrong but could not identify the problem.  The most bizarre part of the meal was the fake shoyu sauce.  After mentioned that the sauce wasnt shoyu, we were informed it was \"low sodium\"-- was definitely not the case.  It had absolutely no taste.  They then brought out a very dark liquid that, again, definitely not soy sauce.  Again, we politely pointed this out.  The waitress came back 5 minutes later with yet another try at serving us soy sauce.  We just decided to pack it up and asked for the check.  $80, no drinks, a few roles and soup consisting of the above.   Hate to give such a bad review but well deserved.....   Cant believe the \"hidden gem\" comment--- that it \"rivals the best in Japan\"-- just complete nonsense.  Definitely a company post--   Regards, Resident of Japan since 93'"}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite to eat on a Saturday night. So we stopped here. There was no one in here but us, but we didn't think much about that because we were mesmerized by the fish tank tables. The waitress was a little rude and seemed to judge our food selections. The chicken teriyaki was bland and the chicken didn't taste like chicken. The sushi was average but the gyoza was really good. Bathroom was in the basement and it was very cold and dark.   Maybe someone else will have better luck there, but it seemed like Montreal already made up its mind."}
