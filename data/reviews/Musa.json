{"text":"Everyone seems to know about the brunch, but lunch and dinner at Musa are fantastic as well.  It's the perfect spot for a casual dinner or a group of friends.   They do a different chicken and fish special each week and we have always loved them.  Things like skate or halibut on sauteed greens or roasted vegetables.  Always lots of interesting and tasty vegetables, combinations and preparations I have never managed at home.  Amazing reductions and sauces.  The chicken might be a rolled up breast stuffed with cheese on top of linguine with rose sauce.  The falafel sandwich and fries are fantastic, and I think only about 9 bucks.  The staff is good and on top of things but relaxed.  The house wine is cheap and good.  Interesting beers on tap.  Great patio.  The brunch is really good, but you should check it out  for dinner.  It's kid-friendly if you go early in the evening when it's not too crowded.  They have a high chair and some nooks for parking strollers."}
{"text":"Alright so can someone at Musa tell me the reason behind their power trip??

I mean are your eggs benny really THAT good that you can ignore the people at your front door for 30 minutes and seat 5 parties before them?
Is your fruit really THAT organic that your waitresses feel the need to roll their eyes at prospective customers?

I was warned pre-Musa visit that the service was bad & living in this city my good service expectations are prettttty low anyway but a 30 minute wait, one rude waitresses, two rude waitress, three rude waitress - finally, seated at a table!. oh..no..wait.... fourth rude waitress ousts us because there was a party of 8 before us (of which we were not informed prior to the 30 minute wait).
Really Musa? no.. your brunch just cant be THIS good!

Needless to say, I cant review the food..  I walked out after the 45 minute Musa ordeal.

If there was a zero star on yelp: Musa's service would get it."}
{"text":"This past weekend I went to Musa with friends. All of us were very pleased with or food and service. it was a hit! I will definitely go back. The only  small  issue was that the hollandaise sauce was baked onto the eggs and a little dry for one of my friends but I am sure you could ask for extra sause on the side . The potatoes served were a hit and I had the tomato sald in lieu of potatoes yummy !!!!  
definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I had a great time eating dinner at Musa. It felt warm and welcoming. The service was a little slow but they had their hands full with a party of twelve, so I don't blame them. The beer was great and the Ravioli was exceptionally filling. Will definitely call again."}
{"text":"This is a great brunch spot.  The ambience is very relaxed and slightly bohemian.  This is a great local place if you want to go and hang out with friends and eat.  The portions are awesome and the price is good.  I didn't find the service as bad as everyone is claiming but everyone has different experiences.  I would not bring a date there to impress but do go with friends!"}
{"text":"Musa, I hate to lower my star rating for you, especially the day after your restaurant suffered from fire injuries, but it's my Yelping duty. 

Lacklustre and chilly service is what really brought my good opinion of Musa down. It was a hot afternoon and our small party of 4 were looking forward to brunch on their patio. Of course, tables were filled, but apparently, waiting was not an option (?) and they insisted we sit inside. After about 5 minutes of sitting, noticed 2 tables on the patio clear out and we had to specifically request, and move ourselves. What happened to service? The rest of the meal passed rather ho-hummish as well. Food was average, and I think our server smiled once the entire time we were there.

Let's see more of those pearly whites if you wanna keep your customers, because goodness knows this city has a ton of alternatives when it comes to gettin' your brunch on."}
{"text":"Both times I've been to Musa I've found their food pretty lackluster (ew soggy eggs), but what really bugs me about them is the warning on their menu -- if you substitute anything, they charge you extra and your order goes to the end of the line.  It pissed me off so much both times I was there that I'm not going to go back.  

Also the first time I was there, my friend's chair broke when he sat on it (he's not overweight), and the second time his chair creaked and moaned.  Fair warning - only the benches are safe!"}
{"text":"Musa was my first introduction to the Toronto Brunch Scene. It will always hold a special place in my stomach.

The brunch meals are an interesting take on traditional favourites. The plates are definitely full, so there is good value for the money, and it always looks gorgeous! Fave meal: Challa French Toast. Super thick, sweet bread surrounded by fresh fruits. I ask them ever so nicely not to include the fruit I'm allergic to, and they have no problem. I'm also a fan of the lumberjack breakfast (that's the big one) with their rosemary potatoes. Other friends go with the steak and eggs, and the bubble and squeak.

The restaurant itself is rather cramped, but in the summertime they are able to open up the side patio and increase their seating area. The interesting decor (mismatched chairs and tables, seemingly picked up from the local garage sales, and random mugs) gives it a homey feel, not unlike you're eating a super-fantastic meal at your buddy's cottage that you didn't have to cook yourself. 

Some days the service leaves a little to be desired, especially once the lineup forms. Get there before 11:30am and you're golden.

They clean up nice for dinner too! Admittedly, I haven't been in a while, but it's almost a different atmosphere, and definitely a different menu. You may want to call before you go to dinner, as some nights they will have private parties and shut the entire place down.

Definitely think twice about going if you have any mobility problems, as there is no room between the tables and the washroom is inaccessible to all but the thinnest of individuals."}
{"text":"Musa USED TO BE soooooo good.  What happened? :(

This was actually one of my favourite brunch spots up until this summer.  The meals were always done right (especially the tropicana, which came with grilled pineapple and other grilled goodies on the side!! - such a fantastic way to start a Sunday!!).

Something changed in 2008 though.  Musa lost its soul.  It's like when Swiss Chalet switched from awesome buns to baby hamburger buns.  Who does that?

I hope Musa comes back, but for now, she's riding the bench."}
{"text":"The best Eggs Bene I've ever had! Simple as that! This place was great for a Sunday morning hangover, breakfast fix!

My cousin used to live in the Queen West area, and we'd walk up to Dundas and relax inside or on the patio! Brought a few friends and they also loved the environment and food! 

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND...
- Traditional Eggs Benedict with homefries"}
{"text":"I'm so sad to hear that Musa was victim to the fire at Dundas and Euclid! 

It was such a beautiful location, I'd heard such great things about it, and was planning on going there for my first time next week! :(

{"text":"There will definitely be a wait, but most good things are worth waiting for.. Ohhhh and you must be in a good mood, because the service sucks.. 

Brunch is fabo at Musa.. All breakfast sandwiches are worth another trip to this establishment. While I don't recommend topping off your breakfast with banana cake, because you'll most likely be stuffed.. you may want to take it to go.. Rich, buttery, yummmmm"}
{"text":"I came here with high hopes, excited as I was reading the mouthwatering menu, but left feeling rather disappointed.  

My scrambled eggs were soggy, served in a puddle and altogether pretty disgusting (and it's been a long time since I've even used that adjective to describe food).  Also, I wasn't pleased that I was paying $12 for the cooks to leave out the cheese in my eggs.  The chunks of mixed, fresh fruit would be sufficient for a hamster to feast on, but the portions were laughable. Good thing they weren't able to mess up the toast.

Having read review from Yelp and other sites, it seems that Musa used to be hopping.  Used to. The managers are going to have to change strategies if they want their clientel to stick around."}
{"text":"I went for brunch at Musa for the first time, a few weeks back. I met some co-workers on a Sunday and got there super early (before they even opened!) We obviously missed any rush. I was a fan of the food there and am looking to get back and try some other items on the menu. The patio is nice and cozy. Price is fair."}
{"text":"This place is good.  I had the eggs benedict and I really liked it.  The portions are large, the french toast was perfection.  There are some fruits on the side to nibble on.  I just wish this place was closer to my home so I wouldn't have to settle for the Sunset Grill."}
{"text":"Even I find it hard to believe that before this weekend, I'd never been to Musa! At noon on Sunday the place was teeming with trendy locals and I had to wait about 10 minutes to get a seat - thankfully I was able to sip a latte at the bar while doing so.

I was a bit overwhelmed by all of the amazing choices on the menu. I had finally narrowed down my choices when I realized there was another page of options to contend with. Urgh. I finally settled on \"Tropicana\" - a plate of mixed fruit, both fresh and grilled, scrambled eggs and avocado. 

The presentation was lovely! The scrambled eggs were served in half of a hollowed out avocado skin while the other half was filled with zesty guacamole. The fruits were tropical and tasty - kiwi, plantains, papaya, passionfruit and mango. I also had cajun spiced roasted potatoes on the side with my meal and they were amazingly crispy and tender!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this spot for breakfast.  The food always amazes me - fantastic breakfast menu selection.  Eggs are always cooked right, served with fruit and delicious potatoes.

It can get busy, especially when the weather is nicer, so be prepared to wait for a table, especially if you arrive after 11:30 on a weekend.  

Service is very spotty - staff are generally friendly, however sometimes you have to wait to get their attention or to get served.  Kinda goes with the territory.

I always look forward to brunch at Musa."}
