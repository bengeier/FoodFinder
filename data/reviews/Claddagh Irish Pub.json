{"text":"Stopped at Claddagh tonight.  We had not been there in over a year so we decided to give it a try.  The good...boddingtons on tap is good as were the pub chips.  On the bad, very bad,  side were the fish from the fish and chips and the \"legendary\" monte cristo  The fish was bone dry.  I know the fish was probably frozen and thawed,  but this seemed like it was frozen during the last ice age.  Really bad.  The monte cristo was quite odd as it was in a dome of dough and covered with powdered sugar.   Certainly only a legend in the mind of the menu's author.  Do not order it.  So, skip the food st Claddagh and just have a boddingtons."}
{"text":"Good eats, good atmosphere. A bit pricey on the drinks. Nice friendly staff. The fish and chips is my main meal. Add a spotted cow or capital amber and you have a great meal."}
{"text":"I like coming here when I want some peace and quiet after Hofbrauhaus.  It's very spacious with plenty of seating so we are always able to grab our favorite table in the back room.  Once the place was crowded (probably because the wait to get into Hofbrauhaus was ridiculous) but last weekend it was relatively empty with groups of people scattered about.  Nice selection of beers though nothing that's super hard to find at another bar with a decent selection (had Harp, Strongbow, etc).  As a bitch, I get excited about their bitch drinks.  Great chocolate martini and buttercup,... of course pricey for the quantity that you get ($6 ish).  Buttercup was more worth its price though.  Had their spinach dip with pitas.  Tasty.  When you seat yourself on a Saturday night, sometimes the wait staff will notice you and come over.  Sometimes they don't.  Either way it's fine since we're ok with walking to the bar to order drinks.  This place tries hard to be Irish, with the Irish-style roadsigns and Guinness things on the walls.  After spending some solid hours at this place, I began to think that their music collection consists solely of Rock Band soundtracks, not that this is a bad thing but... some Irish songs once in a while would be interesting.  It also goes without being said that American sports are shown on the TVs but whatever.  The atmosphere is not as loud as that of a real Irish pub and is more like an American sports bar with an Irish theme.  This is actually a good place for drinking in peace rather than getting your Irish on."}
{"text":"Be incredibly careful with the bartenders there!! A blonde bartender is known for stealing money from the establishment. I went there, ordered one drink and when asked if I wanted to keep it open I said no. I had to ask her three times to give me a receipt! When complaining a friend who DJS there informed me she does that a lot as a way to receive larger tips.   DONT GO!!!"}
{"text":"Visit was Friday, July 3rd around 5pm.  Tables were very sticky. All of them. Wanted inside and stuck us in an irritating spot next to a white cloth covering crates beneath a TV. Sangria was sour and not fruity. Paper towel dispenser was broken in restroom and area was very dirty.  Didn't have the corned beef and cabbage for \"signature\" soup! NO Corned beef and cabbage in an Irish restaurant!!!  The tomatoes on the bruschetta tasted moldy.  The clam chowder soup was too salty.  The soda bread  was tasteless and dry.  Shepherd's pie was too hot (definitely microwaved) and kind of bland although the meat was like chef boyardee.  Also, the decor was bad, everything they had hung was wrinkled. You can tell they don't really care. Waitress was ok. This place needs new management or someone from corporate to come here and see how terrible this place really is.  Will never return again, ever."}
{"text":"Food was delish. Service was excellent. I had the mushroom ravioli and the spouse had the fish and chips and cabbage/corned beef appetizer. Drinks were water and a soda. Bill with tip was just under $50. Very loud so that couples need to sit on the same side of the table to hear each other without yelling. That's okay. We'll be back."}
{"text":"True pub! Fantastic atmosphere, the bartenders laugh and joke around with you and each other (Liz was awesome and Eddie...hilarious). The manager came over and checked on us and joked around too. Great personalities. Awesome time."}
{"text":"Terrible all I ordered was a cheese burger cooked medium but they could not even make that correctly.  First it was so well done it was gross they happily took it back and gave me a raw burger instead.  I finally got it a third time properly cooked and only could eat half because of how bad it was."}
{"text":"Having been to the Claddagh many times now, I can confirm I'm a fan. I've noticed some reviews complaining about the fact it's a chain, but as far as I can see it doesn't pretend to be otherwise. It actually seems to draw more Irish people in than other so-called 'authentic' Irish pubs in Pittsburgh, but I'm likely to think that because I go in to watch the GAA, which always gets 'em in! (It's extremely difficult to find places in Pittsburgh that shows the GAA).  The staff are friendly for the most part (some are great, some are only OK), and the atmosphere is usually good. If you can get a seat at the bar, that's my favourite place to drink. The beer is actually a reasonable price too - I haven't been too shocked by price of anything I've had to drink there.  If you were in the area and in the mood for a drink, you could do a lot worse than this place."}
{"text":"Everything I tasted at this restaurant was absolutely delicious! We were a party of 10 and we all got different things. The Guinness macaroni and cheese was creamy and flavorful and the dish came with a side salad with baby greens and two slices of Irish soda bread. I also tasted the Gaelic chicken, which was a piece of moist chicken breast, and the meatloaf, which was seasoned to perfection. For dessert I ordered the rich and creamy Guinness cheesecake and my 2.5 year old daughter enjoyed a decent sized chocolate brownie topped with whipped cream.   We just so happened to have dined on Father's Day and the restaurant offered a free meal to fathers in celebration. My husband and father-in-law left full and happy!   The service was friendly, decor traditional and appealing and prices reasonable for the generous portion sizes. And they offer a full bar! Too bad we were visiting from out of town because I would most definitely make this a staple in my restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Had a large group here, 30+ people.  So easy to set up with the restaurant.  Very accommodating.  Food was delicious.  Not too crowded.  Very pleased."}
{"text":"Went there with friends for my birthday. Checked in using No Wait, wait time said 15 to 20 mins, that turned into an hour at 10 minute intervals because they stopped seating temporarily \"because of the kitchen\", we were told. Finally got seated, drinks were served in plastic cups, one of which was cracked which poured water over my friend's phone as the waitress handed it across the table. Myself and another guest switched beer brands twice because they were arriving flat. My food came out at room temperature yet everyone else in our party came out hot. I sent it back to be reheated and it came back a few minutes later the exact same way and temperature that it went in. Needless to say I asked to have it taken off the bill and returned to the kitchen, now not wanting anything. They removed it from the bill yet no visit from the manager to apologize or check on other meals. It was such a huge disappointment since we've eaten there in the past and enjoyed it. Claddagh Irish Pub has gone downhill since, with them unable to handle a Saturday night crowd and unable to deliver on a pleasant experience. It was amateur at best and would not recommend from this point on."}
{"text":"My brother band sister were booked to perform a three hour set tonight. I flew in from Florida with my fiancé and we were excited to support them as a pre celebration for our bridal shower. We invited about 40 people to attend the show and about 25 of us were in attendance at around 8:30pm. The show started at 9 and was going well. In he middle of my sister's song, the manager came over and told my brother not to continue. He handed him a check and asked him to leave immediately. I went back to speak with the manager and he said \"this is not the type of music we want for an Irish pub\". They were booked specifically by a manager who he said was fired the day before. At this point, we had spent over $100 and had plans to stay the remainder of the evening. This was the most unprofessional and tacky thing I have ever experienced. Not to mention, it took 30 minutes for a server to come to us, and the food was completely sub-par for the price. We were still willing to stay and spend our money to support our family. This experience has put a damper on our weekend in Pittsburgh. It's not about the money. When someone is passionate about their craft, and good at their craft, it is crushing to be asked to stop in the middle of something you love. Again, unprofessional and tacky. We are all disappointed and the weekend that was supposed to be a celebration has to be salvaged because of this horrible experience."}
{"text":"I've been twice and would definitely go again. The food is good and it's a nice atmosphere. They are usually pretty packed, but the servers aren't grumpy about it and are friendly."}
{"text":"So, I just read some of the other reviews and YIKES!  I mean, I know we Madisonians LOVE all things local but since when did \"chain restaurant\" automatically come to equal \"terrible, horrible crap\"? Being from Madison, I'm a huge supporter of local restaurants but why look down on a small company just because they're growing? I did a little research and Claddagh only has 15 pubs & they're all in the Midwest. And unlike most \"Irish\" pubs in the states, they're are actually owned and operated by Irish people.    As for the food, it's great.  They have hands down THE BEST Fish & Chips in town and their burgers are great!  They also have some fusion dishes on the menu that are pretty tasty.  I tried a bit of the Chicken Curry dish my sister got last time we were there and loving Indian food, I was a little skeptical of an Irish curry but it was delicious.  I got the BBQ Chicken Burger which was awesome.  I'd say that more than anything though, the best thing about Claddagh is their Happy Hour!  My Bud Light was $1 if that tells you anything.  And they DO have Spotted Cow so I'm not sure if the keg was just tapped when \"Aaron B.\" went but they had it when we were there:)  Oh, and their patio is dog-friendly which is nice too."}
{"text":"Our 2nd time visiting in a month. First time was for dinner on a Friday. Food was extremely slow...we ended up being there nearly two hours for 3 people. Today, we went for lunch and sat outside. There were three other tables seated outside with us. The food for the 4 of us took over 45 minutes, and the Monte Cristo we ordered was drenched in grease. It was pooling on the plate.   We sent it back and replaced it with a Signature Burger. It took 20 minutes to get the replacement meal (to go).  We walked inside to find our server and get our  to-go burger and check. There were NO tables seated inside the restaurant! The other 3 tables that were seated outside were all finished eating, and it took 20 minutes for 1 burger?  An hour and a half for lunch on a weekday, with one meal having to be replaced and taken to go, is unacceptable. Claddagh has had good food in the past, but the kitchen staff needs serious improvement and more consistency with the food. Very disappointing and we will not return."}
{"text":"Five stars for consistantly being the best Guinness poured in the USA.....and I travel plenty looking for it.  Fish and chips is my favorite on the menu."}
{"text":"The service was great and the place was nice.  A nice place to watch a sports game on television.  Food was fair.  The chocolate cake was not particularly good.  It appeared to be old and passed it's shelf life.  Probably would not return."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. First my boyfriend and I waited at the front for 5 minutes before the host came. The place was dead. Then after she seated us she proceeded to sit in the back of the bar which led to another couple waiting in the front. Next it took our waitress 10 min to get to our table... Again the place was dead. Then we ordered the STUFFED pork chop which ended up being a dried out piece of pork with stuffing thrown on top of it. We clearly did not like the meal as it sat there and the waitress said nothing. I would never go back here again. I cannot imagine what this place is like when it is busy."}
{"text":"We are new to The Burgh - spent St Paddy's Day here and the corned beef and cabbage was excellent.  Decided to try their Easter Buffet with the family.  Again, no disappointment here!  The buffet choices were delish!  The Bloody Mary bar was super.  From our server Tony,  bartenders  Stephen and Darah,  everything was was perfect. Manager Tom set the tone of Irish hospitality.  They even had candy filled eggs hidden every where for the kids.  Until we can travel to Ireland again this is our new favorite pub and restaurant.   Cant wait to experience what they have planned for Mother's Day.  Love this place!   The Kenney family"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink alone whilst waiting on the ladies to finish a pedicure appointment.  Thought it would be a nice place to enjoy a drink and get some work done on my laptop.  However, the wifi wasn't working.  What irritated me was when I asked a server if they could reset their system she said \"we don't have wifi\".  I said \"but you have a network name that shows up and I just can't connect. Maybe it needs reset?\".  She then said \"oh yeah that hasn't been working for a while\".   So this isn't just bad luck on my part it is a concerted effort on their part to avoid fixing it.  Zero star for lack of wifi and a bonus star because my Irish coffee was very good."}
{"text":"All around bad experience. The waitress took our drink order then came out a while later and asked us if we wanted to order drinks. Got an appetizer that sounded interesting. Pear and blue cheese flatbread with tomato jelly and arugula. The tomato jelly tasted like super sweet spaghetti sauce and was laid on thick. A few crumbs of blue cheese, a couple pieces of walnuts, three little slices of old pear slices topped with dried out greens couldn't compete with the sweet spaghetti sauce. I would've spit it into my napkin but those didn't arrive till awhile later. It was just such a lazy concoction there was no way we were gonna order anything else. Not even the bread pudding. Good thing you can't fuck up a Guinness."}
{"text":"A few years ago, I loved Claddagh's. But about two years ago, things seemed to turn. The service turned extremely slow -- this is based on multiple visits (and neighbors saying the same thing). The last time I was there, my family and I were waiting at our table for minutes while servers were congregated around the bar talking to each other. The manager didn't seem to care. When service finally arrived during past visits, they didn't seem to know the menu that well and were not attentive during the visit.  As for the food -- not very good. Some of the meals seem like frozen entrées reheated - dry and flavorless. The meat (I had both prime rib and lamb) might be OK if you were at a low cost bbq picnic.  My wife found dirty plates and had to wait forever to get a cup of coffee at the morning brunch.  I think others must concur as the place seemed pretty empty during the times I was there.  Like I said -- really good a few years ago, not very good now, and definitely not worth the price. If you're looking for an Irish pub atmosphere, go to Brocach's -- the service and food are both very good  (note: I'm just a customer and don't have any ties to Brocach's)."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Claddagh's. I don't remember my first time being too memorable, but I had a gift card so I decided to give it another shot and treat my fiance.  Our server was friendly and very helpful with the questions we had about the food. I appreciated her honesty; she didn't say anything negative about any of the dishes Claddagh's offers but she definitely directed us to choices that she thought were more ideal.  We ended up getting the Pork Belly Tacos as our appetizer as well as the Gaelic Chicken, a Jameson Burger, and a Guinness Onion Soup.  Food was a little of a mixed bag. The onion soup lacked a lot of flavor. The pork belly tacos were DELICIOUS, it's a shame there's only three. My fiance loved his burger and although I didn't taste it it looked great. I did get a sample of the fries(chips) that come with it, scrumptious. My chicken, while I did enjoy it, did not come as described on the menu. The menu states \"pan seared chicken breasts on a bed of mashed potatoes with a rosemary whiskey-mushroom sauce, glazed carrots & parsnips.\" What I received was the chicken with the sauce, the mashed potatoes and carrots as scoops on the side, and no parsnips. The chicken/sauce was tasty. The mashed potatoes were standard but edible (it would have made a difference for them to be used as a bed as described where they could soak in that sauce). The carrots were the worst feature, under-cooked, basically raw.  We, however, found another big hit with the Fireside Cider (whiskey, hot cider, brown sugar, cinnamon). These. are. AMAZING.  Overall, we enjoyed the experience and will visit again."}
{"text":"We went to Claddagh only because I had a $10 coupon. We walked in early on a Friday night, we were seated in an empty section. Got menus, decided what we wanted to order and waited, and waited. It took too long for the waitress to get to us. Why? there were only people in the bar, hardly any diners yet. We each ordered the fish sandwich. I ordered a vodka tonic, my husband ordered scotch, neat. The glass the scotch came in had a big booger-like thing stuck to the side of the glass and the tonic in my drink was completely flat.  We sent both drinks back. The fish sandwich came on a huge ciabatta bun, too much bun, too much non-fresh, hard bun. Is a ciabatta bun Irish? Me thinks not. The fish tasted like it had been deep fried the night before and then microwaved when I ordered it. It was mushy! Before we were done eating the hostess came by with people to be seated at another table, she asked if she could have one of our chairs. We said yes. (Why couldn't she have grabbed a chair from one of the myriad empty tables??) Then, she sat these people at a table right next to us. She put the chair she took from our table at the end of their table. The poor guy sitting in that chair couldn't even sit back all the way because he'd be touching our table. I had to skooch in all the way in order for one of the other people to get to the table, and none of us were fat people. The place was still empty, why seat these people in our laps?  Never going back again, unless I get a coupon for 2 free meals and a puppy."}
{"text":"I try my darndest to not wind up both hungry and on the west side of Madison  simultaneously.  But sometimes it just happens.  We were close enough to Middleton (and we had a coupon) so we decided to try Claddagh--about which had heard good things.  Besides it was rainy--seemed about the right kind of weather for Irish food.  Okay, so one of the best things about Irish restaurants is that you can have beer and breakfast for supper--delightful!  Irish breakfasts are the best--a bunch of terrifying sounding (but delicious) meats, eggs, beans, chewy toast and that questionable tomato.  I ordered a Harp to go with my heart-stopper and my husband got the fish and chips and a Boddington.  While we waited for our food, we rested our arms on the questionably sticky table and watched American football on the ginormous tvs that surrounded us.  About 5 mins after ordering the waitress came back out to apologize that the kitchen had run out of the blood puddings (the very best part of Irish breakfast because it's the part that I'm only going to get when I go out to eat--I don't make blood pudding at home)--and I consented to getting extra bangers instead (mostly because \"substitute extra bangers\" is just too hilarious a phrase to say no to).  Our food came out after a reasonable period of time and I realized that their breakfast somehow doesn't include the beans--so now, no puddings, no beans--just a bunch of bangers, some ham, eggs, questionable slice of tomato and chewy toast without butter.  It was all edible, but nothing I'd ever go back for--the bangers were sweet, salty and soft, with a really flaccid skin--no spice or bite to them at all.  But  it was essentially a Perkins quality breakfast, without hash browns (although, on the plus side, I did have that beer).  My husband thought the fish was fantastic--flakey and well cooked.  But his chips were huge wedges of under-cooked potatoes--ick.  And to add insult to injury, in his hunger he had been add-on sold by the waitress to get some sort of sauce to go with the chips--the sauce came to the table with a thick congealed skin on it; when I finally managed to get a chip to break through the skin we realized that it was essentially a $1.50 ramekin of cheese whiz.  ew.  um, so, yeah.  maybe it was a fluke of a meal, but we were fairly unimpressed."}
{"text":"Been waiting for a waitress for over an hour now. Asked hostess and they claimed they would send one over but still none have shown. Awful service."}
{"text":"Can I give a negative star? Because that is what they deserve. Came in for lunch at 1 pm with husband, walked in no hostess, decide to go to bar. Waitress walks by tells me where bathroom is, toilet doesn't flush, water all over floor, go back to bar no bartender has helped husband. Sit there for another 17 minutes, waitress is across from us entering an order. Woman comes out goes behind bar and starts complaining to waitress. So we left. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Went for a friends birthday and it was the worst dining experience any of us had had. Our waitress was terrible. She complained to us about other tables, forgot orders, and by the end of the night was slamming our food and refills (once we finally got them) down on the table. Such a shame to have a night out for a birthday ruined because of a terrible waitress. We won't be back again.  As for the food - it was cold and most of us lost our appetite after waiting so long."}
{"text":"Claddagh Irish Pub is a good restaurant located in Legacy Village. The place is meant to represent an Irish pub, and they do a decent job when considering that this a building built only a few years ago in a shopping center. I mean, there's no way to totally recreate a pub atmosphere, but they do a good job trying. There is a good amount of seating, but you're bound to wait for a while if you go during a busy time such as Saturday night. The servers we encountered were all very nice. One thing you'll notice about the food is that most of it isn't even Irish. There are some Irish specialties on the menu, but most of it has nothing to do with Ireland. But take it for what it is, the food is pretty good. I had the Filet of Sole Mcdermott, which was on a limited time menu. I found it to be okay, but not great. The fish was kind of bland. There was cheese and crabmeat on the inside of the filet. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. It came with mashed potatoes, which were great. They had bits of potato skin in them and were nice and buttery. I also had the clam chowder with it, which I highly recommend. This wasn't the first time I've been here and while I couldn't tell you what I had in the past, I remember it being very good. Overall, if you're heading over to Legacy Village, consider going into Claddagh's for dinner."}
{"text":"It has a comfortable, relaxed, yet stylish ambience making it perfect for a night out with friends, a relaxed business meeting, a date night, or the family dinner. The food is more sophisticated than the usual bar food, it is also delicious and well presented, likewise the service is fast, professional and friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I really enjoy nearly every restaurant meal because I cook for a living, so it's a treat to eat out! I've been to the Claddagh several times and never much liked it but a friend wanted \"Irish food\", so off we went.  Wow, they hit a new low tonite. Yuck chowder tasted like raw flour plus a certain dirty taste, yuck gritty salad with bland goo dressing, tiny shrimp in lots of breading, tiny portion of corned beef and cabbage, tasteless shroom app, etc. I ended up eating the fries for dinner. Our server was lovely so I hope she gets another job bc we'll never be back to the Claddagh.  The star is for her."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour.  $3 shandies were good!! Their loaded chips are super tasty, but not worth $10.  Overall, good experience and would go back for more."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday afternoon. Many empty tables but a waiter didn't show up for 10 minutes. Placed entire order and drinks came after 30 more min. When food finally came it was very bland and boring. Everything took forever but the place was not crowded. Not going back"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The manager, \"Emily\", is one of the rudest people I have ever come across. I specifically will not be returning because of her."}
{"text":"This was the second time I was here and the first time the service was really good this time when we got there we had a reservation for a small group they put us in this back room by the kitchen and it was very hot and uncomfortable in this room we asked our server if we could move to other table he came back after talking to the manager and set us up a table outside and we moved there and then when we were outside of our service got even worse it took us a little over 45 mins to get our food and there wasn't  that many people there and there were  tables outside getting there stuff before us and I don't know if I ever heard of this  but you have a bar and you run out of a drink and then the food wasn't Cooked to what we wanted the manger was very nice I don't think I will going back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Can be loud and crowded at night, but I love to visit on weekend afternoons or mornings and have the full Irish breakfast. The fireside tables are great on cold days. They serve up some of the best bloody Mary's in town. Add a Draft Harp chaser and a shot of Jameson's and you have the best brunch this side of heaven. Lots of  draft beer options. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Claddagh's is closed permanently. The space is being remodeled and Biaggi's will be moving in."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago - it was OK.   Had a good time, but was there in the afternoon on a weekday (yep, I'm classy) so it was pretty dead. I'm pretty sure we were the only people in there.   The bartenders were really friendly and cute - I think that was the most significant part of my experience to be honest.   Will go back and try it again at a non-alcoholic person's time of day!"}
{"text":"Terrible bartenders. Neglectful even when empty bar and they ignore the customers. The drinks are extra sweet so come if you want to drink juice instead of alcohol"}
{"text":"I recently read a review about the bar staff that was pure slander. They wouldn't!  My husband and I sit at the bar all of the time and enjoy their company. We are always greeted with a smile, fast drinks and good food. Only complaint- if you sit too close to the kitchen, it can get loud."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff.   Live music during dinner is a nice touch."}
{"text":"I  recently visited Claddagh Irish Pub in Middleton's Greenway Station for a happy hour-munchies thing after work with a pal. We had beer, shared an order of the corned beef and cabbage rolls, and split a \"Paddy Mac\" sandwich, which is essentially a Reuben. The food was quite good. I especially enjoyed the corned beef and cabbage rolls, which when I went, were similar to a fried wonton that had the fixings of St. Patrick's Day dinner inside. Sort of like an Irish egg roll. Yum. The Reuben was average, but the fries were pretty tasty as well. Service was unremarkable in either a good or a bad way. All said and done, I would usually rank that sort of experience as four stars. Normally, I would definitely return to a restaurant that showed me a good time and had good food.   Why then, you ask, is this a one star review? Let me explain.  I take major (MAJOR) issue with Claddagh's use of the words \"gluten friendly\" to describe certain menu items. (Menu items that are often served with bread.)  I presume this was done in an effort to appeal to the now-popular dietary trend of avoiding gluten. The problem with this, Claddagh, is that \"gluten friendly\" is not a thing. If someone can't eat gluten, then they can't eat gluten. Period. Full stop.   Claddagh's use of the term \"gluten friendly\"  to describe foods that still contain gluten, would be like if JIF Peanut Butter made a new type of peanut butter that was 50% peanuts and 50% almonds...and then tried to market the new product as \"Peanut Allergy Friendly\". Does that make sense?   Although I personally find  vague claims of \"gluten intolerance\" dubious, especially when the person has never had a problem eating gluten before, there are definitely people with a **medical diagnosis** of Celiac's disease who absolutely, under no circumstances, can consume gluten. I feel that Claddagh's attempt at marketing its menu to appeal to the \"gluten-free\" dietary trend could harm people who actually need to avoid gluten for important medical reasons. Even if it's not a life or death situation, people who wish to avoid gluten should be allowed to do so without having to jump through hoops and worry about being tricked by menus.   It's majorly unethical to twist words to imply that a thing is something that it's not. This is especially true when the item in question (food) has the potential to directly impact a person's health.   Claddagh: fix your menu. If you want to offer gluten-free options, then please do so. However, referring to a spinach-artichoke dip appetizer served with crostini or to a hamburger served on a wheat bun , or even to your fish fry, which is battered in flour as \"gluten friendly\", is unethical. People have a right to know what's in their food, and this feels like a deliberate attempt to mislead people in the name of making more money."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times.  I've always had a good time and good service here.  I appreciate the traditional Irish cuisine with an American twist on it. Every meal I had there was of good portion and delicious.  The service has never been half bad either!  It is a little pricey but it should be expected seeing as it is located on the South Side of Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Nice, casual atmosphere. Tasty corned beef egg rolls, delicious Irish beef stew and really good fish and chips. Lunch portions are generous. We would have had the suggested bread pudding for dessert, but we were so full we couldn't do it."}
{"text":"I flew in from out of town, and they were walking distance from my hotel. It was 10:20PM and, according to Yelp, they were supposed to be open, so I walked there. They weren't open. I tried a phone call, and the guy who replied simply said there was nobody there, so they decided to close. In my humble opinion, publishing business hours it's a bonding promise to any possible customer. Apparently, they don't share my opinion, and consider business hours just a suggestion."}
{"text":"Great service with a smile and genuine warmth, and good food too. I ordered a burger, and my wife ordered fish.  The burger came rare, per my request -- and because they make their own patties I was not worried about the health effects that rare ground beef comes with in many restaurants. Fresh bun, nice slice of tomato, so-so lettuce.  My wife was not so wild about her fish. It was a single *huge* piece that nade her comment \"it looks like half of an entire fish\". Maybe a bit of hyperbole on her part, but it was large. Bit too much breading, though.  Beer selection was good, and we were there on a Sunday when they have an all-day (and night) happy hour. I had Capital IPA (good!) and my wife had a porter.  One thing that this restaurant did not seem to focus on is traditional Irish food. It's on the menu; however based on what I was reading it didn't seem to be a focus. That's fine with me, because Irish food is too heavy for my taste (and besides, I have enough of it when I go to Ireland).  I visit here on average 1-2 times per year, which is how often I am in town from Seattle. In other words, it's kind of a go-to joint for me. No, it's not outstanding. But certainly serviceable when in need of food and a good beer. Which is fine by me."}
{"text":"Nice place. Super slow service..  Almost felt like customers annoyed the bartenders. Was it busy yeah..but not super busy..u dont criss cross a bar when bartending..u start in the same spot check the customers and work your way around. The bar had about 30 seats..and sure they are making table drinks but still..I've been in places with crowds 3x this and service was better. Sorry that's the stone cold truth"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on Wednesday night. Group of 13. The place does have the ambience if a pub.....soccer ads, flags. Antique looking flooring .....it felt good in there. They have a very good selection of beer on tap.  Of course, Irish whiskey too. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable.  Quality of food was very good. Fried appetizers tasted great and did not have the stale oil taste. I had the eggs (coated and fried, with crispy shell). Also had their shamrock wings and fries.  All good. For entree I had their home made veggie burger. It was very tasty. It came with lettuce, tomatoes onions and a pesto style sauce. Also comes with a side of fries.  Overall a good experience. Good company, good food, good service, good ambience means good times!!"}
{"text":"Nice place in the South Side works area, they have happy hour specials and good food. They also have a really nice outdoor seating area. Employees are friendly but sometimes the service could be faster. But overall a nice place to go!"}
{"text":"I really have no complaints about Claddagh. My experiences here have been normal and not disappointing, though not the BEST in the world. But I don't ask for too much of chain restaurants anyways...  You have to come here without high expectations. It's a pub themed chain, which means it's not going to be authentic in any way and certainly not impressive if you've been to a real pub or something closer to authentic before. It's about the flash and novelty of the Irish theme and if you sit at the bar with a Harp or a Guinness and eat some fried food, then you've gotten to the core of it. Which is exactly what I choose to do here.  The most recent time I was here was pretty typical of what to expect, though I can't say I've ever actually sat at a table, so this is a bar seating only review. Which, if you ask me, is the only way to go at a place like this. Looking for a nice sit-down dinner is not what you should be doing here. When we came in, the hostess was a little...dazed and not helpful, but the bartender was on his game and seemed happy to do his job and help us out. We had no unusual wait times and the beer was crisp and delicious. I had the Jameson burger, which was perfect for what it was. It wasn't cooked to perfection, but it was a greasy delicious mess that was completely satisfying. Honestly, if I were in the area and craving a greasy burger, this is where I'd go. The flavors were rich and I feel like I really got the \"novelty\" experience.  The best concise way to describe Claddagh: Irish Applebee's."}
{"text":"I don't usually find myself regularly going to \"mall restaurants\" because Madison has more local places than I have time to visit and I usually figure I can try a chain restaurant anywhere.  That being said Claddagh has become a bit of a favorite family tradition for my father, grandmother and I.  The Greenway Station area falls about halfway between my father's shop in Paoli and my work.  We started meeting up for late lunches on Fridays and dinners on other nights, and I've always been impressed with the food.  I wasn't quite sure of the place before my first time there but over the last few years I've grown to really enjoy the atmosphere.  My father, despite never being able to pronounce the name, considers it one of his favorites in Middleton.  My 92-year old grandmother tagged along with him once and ordered the corned beef and cabbage, which is the largest single serving meal I have ever seen.  She's come along a few more times since because of it.  My grandmother absolutely loves corned beef and cabbage and she can tuck in pretty well on it.  Then she takes the rest home and has dinner for the next three days.  I personally like the fish and chips.  I don't eat much fried fish (never been one for the vaunted WI Friday Fish Fry) but I do enjoy the way Claddagh uses a large cod filet and doesn't make the fish too greasy.  The \"chips\" are pretty delicious thick pub fries and I actually really like them with the tartar sauce that comes with the fish.  I also learned that I like malt vinegar.  I wash it all down with an Imperial pint of Smithwick's or two.  The sandwiches that I've tried have all been quite good.  The version of the Rueben comes with coleslaw instead of kraut but this actually comes off really well.  The meatloaf sandwich is perfect comfort food in the winter.  Unfortunately my favorite sandwich was taken off the menu about a year or so ago but despite that there's plenty of options to go with.  My father and I have gotten the lunch specials of the shepherd's pie and the beef stew, which was perfectly sized, filling but not coma-inducing.  Of course I have no idea how \"authentic\" this all might be since this was the first Irish-themed restaurant I've been to.  I would compare it favorably to the food at Brocach downtown or Erin's on the east side.    For a chain restaurant in a new shopping center on the outskirts of Middleton I would rate Claddagh a solid 3.5 to 4 stars.  My expectations have always been met or exceeded and the staff have always been friendly.  The names are all pretty hokey - Brian Boru steak salad! - but that's kind of part of the charm.  I've got friends that get a bit worn out by the Irish music in the background but I've always kind of enjoyed it.  There are bands every so often at the restaurant and bar service goes pretty late.  There is an outdoor patio that is OK during the warm months, though it does just look out on the parking lot expanses of Greenway Station.  I've stopped in a time or two for drinks and the bartenders have always been exemplary (much like Brocach), but the main reason I keep coming back is for dining and the friendly convenience.  It's a bit of fake mall culture to an extent, but it's well done fake mall culture."}
{"text":"An Irish pub that plays Snoop Dogg's Gin & Juice?  A bit confused by this but I liked it. It was quite dead for a Friday night but that just means faster drink service for me. Just to be different, I was the girl drinking a Corona."}
{"text":"Ok, this deserves an update because theres apparently been an upswing in food quality.  The fries are back to normal, and my favorite Shamrock Sandwich is back, but with one chicken breast instead of two. Completely understandable in the current economy, particularly considering the one in Crocker Park went belly up  Service is still good, and apparently the other food items are back up to par too, but... once bitten twice shy."}
{"text":"Had a couple wonderful experiences here. Tried the fish and chips, pretty good, but the steak was absolutely amazing! Service has been wonderful and the atmosphere is comfortable. I would come here with friends anytime."}
{"text":"I don't know what sucks worse...the food or the service.  It wasn't even busy the Saturday night we went (bad sign).  The fried pickles were all batter, no pickle.  And they arrived stone cold.  Our server took them back and brought us hot ones.  The stew came highly recommended from the server and the beef was like chewing shoe leather.  Many people at the table grabbed the salt shaker...it didn't have much taste.  The chicken was just okay.  The highlight on the table was the sweet chili wings.  They were pretty damn good.  The service was terrible.  We had to ask our server for water twice.  We had to get our own silverware from the bar.  And the table next to us had all the same issues with the server.  It took forever to get our drinks, too.  The manager finally came by and said she took the fried pickles off our bill.  Skip this place.  There are many, many other places to go for way better food and service."}
{"text":"The food was great- the corned beef sandwich was done perfectly and the Irish Beef stew was awesome.  The corned beef wraps were pretty good, but could have used a bit more corned beef. Our server, India, was awesome as well."}
{"text":"My friends and I cannot get enough of this place! This is another of our go-to spots for good drinks, chill atmosphere, and dancing!  Claddagh's is located in the South Side Works and is separated from the crazy that can be Carson Street. It sits across from Hofbrauhaus and makes for a great place to be in the summer. They have a large bar with a good selection of liquors and beers. The food menu is also great if you enjoy Irish pub food. We have had meals and apps here before, but frequent more for the laid back bar scene in the evenings. On most weekends, they have a DJ that plays a variety of music. The dance floor is small but we are usually the only ones on it anyway ;)  They also host various artists and events, specifically on St. Patrick's Day. They set up tents outside for live bands and have a plethora of beer to drink. In the warmer months, they have an outdoor patio and firepit you can sit around and enjoy the company of friends. What more could you ask for??"}
{"text":"An authentic Irish Pub on Pittsburgh's South Side. And International Soccer on a big screen."}
{"text":"I should preface this with saying that I'm super Irish it would be impossible for me to give Claddagh a bad review (even if it's not all that authentic). I've Irish danced here and had too much fun here in the past.  As for my last visit, we went here because it was pretty much the only kitchen in the area that was still open (we went after 11 p.m.). They were only serving appetizers still but that was just fine because they had some ballin appetizers. The red pepper dip was da bomb, the cheese plate was phenom, and really good french fries too (it's hard to mess up french fries, but they were really good).  Our waitress was awesome and so attentive. We were realllyyyyyy starving and asked her to bring everything out as soon as it was ready instead of all at once and she was happy to oblige.  I'll probably be back here late night, especially if I can't find any other late night spots."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for dinner on a Thursday night - Thursday night is Trivia night and it is pretty loud, but the noise wasn't the issue.  It was the service and food.  The waitress was nice and offered to answer menu questions which I took her up on asking a couple of items on the menu like the corned beef and cabbage rolls - I specifically asked if it was corned beef inside cabbage - she said yes so I ordered them.  I was debating weather to order some soup and the waitress said, that soup doesn't take long and I could order it later if I wanted.  My husband ordered the bangers and mash.  We didn't have to wait too long for the food to arrive, but instead of the corned beef and cabbage rolls, I got the corned beef sliders - the waitress that delivered the food was nice enough to leave them since I was hungry and also placed another order for the corned beef and cabbage rolls.  I ate one of the sliders and it was decent.  My husband's dish was just so so, the gravy looked good until I tried it, bland and didn't taste home made like they used onion soup to make it.  When the corned beef and cabbage rolls arrived, I was surprised to see that they were actually egg rolls stuffed with mostly potatoes and a little corned beef and cabbage.  Obviously this was not as described on the menu or by the waitress and the worst part is they were super bland and not good.  The original waitress did come by to say it was her fault the order got screwed.  Prior to receiving the bill we gave the waitress a $10 certificate purchased through Community Change to support a charity.   When the bill arrived I was surprised to see that we were charged for the wrong appetizer in addition to the one I actually ordered.  When I pointed that out to the waitress she said she could take it off but then we couldn't use the certificate because we had to order 2 entrees in order to use it and went on and on how people don't read the fine print.  I didn't recall seeing the 2 entree requirement on the certificate, but let it go.  I happen to have another certificate at home and so checked it - here is what the certificate said \"Valid for parties of 2 or more.  Savings Certificates may NOT be combined.  One certificate allowed per visit per table. Not valid daily specials, coupons or other offers.\"  The certificate did NOT state we had to order 2 entrees so be careful when using these as it seems that Claddah likes to make up the rules, rather than follow what's stated."}
{"text":"Was seated at 9:38. Waited for waitress who never showed. Flagged down the hostess to ask about our server. She apologized and said that someone new would be right over. That never happened. At 9:55 we moved to the bar when two seats opened up and were not spoken to until 10:02. Not a nod or a be right with you. Nothing. Shameful. I will be avoiding this place in the future"}
{"text":"Went to this pub last night. There was an awesome DJ that played requests with seamless transitions. We didn't try the food since we had already eaten but the service was prompt and friendly. The bartender Amber was such a sweetheart and so patient with our huge group of already inebriated friends. I have been to many pubs in Ireland and this was a pretty close reminder of home. Great setup, decor, staff, and drink selection. I highly reccomend."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for our 2nd trivia night at Claddaugh's. I had called that afternoon and made reservations for 4 of us at 7:30, however, when we got there, my name wasn't on the list at all. It was a little disappointing because we were sat in the corner and couldn't really hear that well. It was pretty muffled. My friends and I had ordered various foods. Someone had a chicken sandwich - that was sent back because it wasn't cooked all the way but the next one was good, someone else had chicken fingers and then my friend and I had ordered appetizers - potato skins and spinach and artichoke dip. I really liked the dip. It came with bite size pieces of bread. We did better at Disney trivia than we did last time at FRIENDS and look forward to the next theme! I"}
{"text":"Since I started working in South Side Works, I've been to Claddagh's many times.  Within the last year or two I've become a regular, showing up at least once a week.  First it was just a convenient place to go, but then I discovered that they have $2.50 drafts all day on Tuesday.  I don't know of a single place around that can beat that deal.  The food and service were hit and miss for a while, unless you sat at the bar, then it was usually top notch.  Recently they have fallen under new management, and he is doing great things with the place.    There are new items on the menu, I recommend the duck, cob salad, and the fried pickles.  Lunch service is drastically improving with some very good flat breads and much faster service for those of us who have to get back to work.  They offer many more craft beers on tap now, keeping more taps on rotation and replacing some more dated beers with much more trendy and in my opinion much better beers in general.  This is a great place to come to watch just about any sports game with TVs everywhere.  When its warm enough you can sit outside and they even have a very nice fire pit.  They have also recently started a pint club, with some awesome perks that I enjoy immensely and recommend asking about.  At first I wasn't sure about this place, but it is quickly becoming one of my favorite places on the South Side."}
{"text":"Slightly pricey drinks and apps. I got a Guinness which was as expected. Wife got a Magners Cider. We got the cheese curds and beer cheese and pretzels. Curds were a little soggy, but still tasty, the beer cheese and pretzels we're really good. Wanted a whiskey but they were super proud of it."}
{"text":"Was thinking about not writing a review and then read the reviewer from 8/2 talking about a quality in food upswing? Upswing my Aunt Fanny. I met a friend here tonight after her workout at Urban Active, and to be honest the only reason we met here was because I was in the mood for a Strongbow and I knew they had it on tap. Thank goodness Strongbow is always good...... we both finally settled on a veggie burger as it was the only thing on the menu that seemed somewhat health conscious. When they arrived we both looked at each other baffled as they looked more life patties of vomit on buns. Once we got past the look of them and then the blandness, I was able to eat half and after she coated hers in ketchup she polished it off as she was starved after a workout. Service was so/so....... not too bad, not too great. If I'm in the mood for a Strongbow again I'll know to pick up a 4-pack and make dinner at home!"}
{"text":"Worst service of my life. The time between visits from our server was a minimum of 20 minutes every time."}
{"text":"Do not recommend. Table was sticky when we sat down. Server greeted us promptly and took a drink order. Only one drink needed to come from the bar and it took 10 minutes (the place was empty) and tasted weak. Food arrived in stages because my husband's dish was delivered to another table by mistake. My friend's side did not arrive because the server had forgotten to ring it in. My husband loves fish and chips but reported theirs were \"meh.\" After delivering his meal late, the server did not come back and check on it until he'd finished. Even my kids didn't like the chicken tenders, which is unheard of. I ordered deviled eggs that looked like they'd been sitting out and a tossed salad that I asked to be removed from the bill since it had produce that was clearly past prime. Wrinkled tomatoes, one with a blue vein, and cucumbers that were limp. They did so without argument, which I appreciated. I am a former server so I am generally quite patient and understand things happen. But all of this in one visit really stunk."}
{"text":"I gave this 4-stars because they not only offer the full irish breakfast, but they nailed it.  Took me right back to my trip to Ireland."}
{"text":"4 Stars for amazing bloody Marys!! Friendly service, consistently good fish sandwiches and a wide selection of beers on draft will keep me coming back for more! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This seems to be the trend at Claddagh. I  enjoyed  this Pub in the past, but service and quality has gone downhill. This is from my 29 y/o daughter:  Claddagh kind of sucks and here's why... (in order of appearance) 1. Refused to serve me even though I had ID... a lot of kids use fake IDs when out to lunch with their mother, right? 2. Served me rotten salad greens 3. Manager came over to argue rottenness of salad greens... um, no honey. I eat lots of salad. They don't \"always look like that\" unless they've gone bad. Booooooooooo. Boo!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. I do admit, the food was tolerable. However, the service was terrible, it took over half an hour for our waitress to bring our check (we went for dinner on a Tuesday night...not crowded at all)   Despite the bad service the first time around, we really liked the Irish Coffee and thought \"heck, why not give it another go and just sit at the bar?\" So, we went back a few days later after we had dinner elsewhere to get Irish Coffee. When we arrived there were no open seats at the bar, so we sat at a table in the bar area. We sat at the table for about 10 minutes wondering whether a waitress would help us or if we needed to approach the bar to order drinks. Judging by our previous experience, (BAD service) we went up to the bar to order. The bartender barked at us saying that someone would be around to take our order, and that it wasn't his job to take orders from people sitting at tables in the bar area. So, we returned to our table. A waitress never approached us.   Eventually, two seats opened at the bar. We moved there since apparently you need to be sitting at the bar to order from the bartender. After about 5 more minutes of waiting, the bartender approached us. I ordered Irish Coffee and his response was \"See, that's why I didn't want to come over here, I knew you were going to order something like that. You've never been a bartender before, have you?\" People that don't want to make complicated cocktails should not work at a bar that serves them. Also, people that act like that towards customers probably shouldn't be working in the service industry.   In conclusion, the food is mediocre and the staff is rude. Skip this place and go next door to Cheeseburger in Paradise. The happy hour deals are good and the staff doesn't complain when you order a complicated drink."}
{"text":"The food here is great! I came here years ago, but had the privilege of visiting again recently. Atmosphere is great, staff is attentive and laid back. Parking absolutely sucks but it's Pittsburgh. French onion soup was wonderful and the Monte Cristo was the BEST I've had. Very greasy an non-heart healthy but damn it was awesome! Kettle chips were a nice change from fries or potato chips. They have an extensive selection of beer but I was driving and afraid I would want to try them all."}
{"text":"Been several times and the service is excellent. The menu is a bit thin but you can drink your way through the Isles in beer & whiskey.  The food I had was good, just uninspired. This is a smaller chain that goes big on style and beverages."}
{"text":"Food was so so- I got their Jameson burger. It was a strange texture And I don't even know why they ask how you want the burgers cooked I got mine medium rate and it looked the same as everyone else's. Cool ambiance great draft selection, live music- all good things, but what really really turned me off was the service and the fact that you are not served on a plate. You get your food in a bucket and on a paddle. Maybe for some folks that's ok, not my style it was totally awkward to eat off of."}
{"text":"Arggh.  Tables were sticky.  The poor waiter explained that the tables had been refinished improperly.  But ick. Good was adequate but not well done or memorable. I had the Shepherds Pie.  - acceptable.  Friend had the full Irish breakfast-- bad."}
{"text":"Great drinks and I always love their food.  It is awesome.  Service is bar none and always on point. The Clam Chowder is the best ever.  Go here and have a drink and a smile."}
{"text":"Gangster rap at an Irish pub?  The food, beer and service was great but after the live band left a DJ (a friend of the manager) started blasting music which was totally inappropriate and unexpected for an Irish-themed establishment"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped into Claddaugh at about 1:30 on Saturday November 8, 2014. We ordered Scotch eggs for an appetizer. My wife ordered their signature corned beef soup. I ordered fried bangers for my meal. The scotch eggs came out immediately and were very good. Most places offering this dish overcook the eggs -- they're supposed to be soft in the middle (these were).  Then, the wait began. About twenty minutes later, our waiter came up and said our food was on its way. I asked him if he could at least bring out my wife's soup, because, well, it's soup (it's not like you have to bake it or anything). After another 12 minutes, the soup and my fried bangers arrived. The waiter said there was a wedding going on. I replied, \"but you have weddings in here all the time, you'd think you'd be able to manage that.\" so it goes. The signature soup was very tasty.  It was however very skimpy on the corned beef (and I mean like a couple of really small bites). And, to my taste, it was overloaded with potatoes. All that said, it tasted great. The fried bangers were delicious. I'm guessing the wurst is home made -- if not, kudos to whomever they get it from.  The second long wait was for the check. I'm guessing we waited for about 15 minutes after we were done eating before it arrived. It took an hour and fifteen minutes to eat lunch (at least I had good company -- my wife).  The food was good. The long wait due to a wedding was a poor excuse I thought.  I'll definitely eat at Claddaugh again.   PS -- If you haven't already, sign up for their rewards card. It gives you $5.00 off the meal and another %15 I believe (they process the card on the spot)."}
{"text":"Nice place right across from my hotel in the South side . Had dinner there food was good and beer prices were reasonable and bartender was efficient. Would definitely go back next time in the area."}
{"text":"My wife and I finally got a night out without the kids. It was St. Patricks day so we were going to do it up like we were 21 again!  We both dressed up in our green attire and was ready to have a good time!  we walked straight to the crowded bar and the bartender made eye contact with my wife and I. She came over to us and we order our first round.  After first round, i went back, again she noticed us right away and asked if we wanted the same drinks. She introduced her self as LIZ, and her and my wife chit-chatted for a few. Liz the rest of the night while waiting on numerous customers always had a smile on her face and was patient with everybody. Next time my wife and I get another date night, we will definitely choose cladda and hope Liz is working!"}
{"text":"Went with the girlfriend one night for drinks. Sticky table. Like \"I can scrape off the gooey crud lining the top of this table with my fingernail\" kind of crud. Did not order food. Seems like I'm not missing much based on past reviews."}
{"text":"Monday Lunch Special: Buy one get one free Fish and Chips. Fish piece was the size of my arm. French fries were thick cut. Malt Vinegar placed at just the right time before I opened my mouth to request it. Wash it all down with a cider or a Guinness on tap. BOOM. Delish."}
{"text":"Their Jameson burger is amazing - I'd highly recommend it. Great and friendly service, as well"}
{"text":"Last night we came in to celebrates our boy getting married. All the groomsmen came out to discuss the bachelor party while having drinks and food. Our server could care less about us. We timed it at 9 mins per order for drinks, half our food came out and then 11 mins later the rest of the tables food came out. My pasta was missing a main ingredient, the chorizo, but my server said it was in there and that it was minced finely. NO CHORIZO!!! Honestly the food and service was extremely disappointing. I'm visiting from Baltimore where we have a claddaghs pub..no relation to this one...what a disaster tonight!!! Stephen..aka Skittles..was our server and he needs to be retrained. Poor service and bad food."}
{"text":"Beer was good, decor was typical Irishy-pubby. Food was alright. How was you mess up a pour of Guinness?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. Only 2 guys at the bar. The bartender/server/manager was poorly trained. While he seemed to be running the place he wasn't very pleasant. They should close for lunch if that is all the staff they are going to operate with. We had salads and the lettuce was old and mostly inedible. The Irish clam chowder was mostly potatoes. I asked for a draft list and he told me they are all around the bar and I could go up and look at them.  It's a shame this place had gone downhill so much."}
{"text":"great irish pub.  huge bar.  every liquior and beer you could want.  great food.  excellent tomato bisque.  been there several times and it's always good.  always crowded too.  what recession?"}
{"text":"I ordered three sides Brussels,fries,and kale. The kale was supposed to have bacon on it but it did not taste good so after a few bites I stopped eating. I had an upset stomach for the rest of the day looking back at the picture it seems that it was undercooked. (Loaded onto pictures) The Brussels however were delicious and the fries were typical.  Our server and ambience saved the rating. We sat outside and it was comfortable and fun with the 70 degree weather. Our server was attentive, even though we sat outside we still did not have to wait for anything.  I will go back again but just to have drinks I don't feel like being sick for days after eating."}
{"text":"Their food and atmosphere is amazing. You've to try their beer cheese and/or Guineas mac and cheese.  The presentation of their dishes is artisan, while still feeling old school Irish. As for taste, it's very rich. Be ready to take some home if you don't eat a lot. It's not huge portions, but not small either. Medium portions of rich food. Exactly what I want from a good Irish Pub that's more than just a pub. If nothing else, come here to check out the building and decoration. It looks like a castle inside and out, and not in a kitchy way. Hardwood floors, regal yet reserved chairs, and Corinthian pillar pull together a sort of Irish-European mix of royalty and boys down at the town pub. Love this place. I think my fiancé and I will go here for our wedding rehersal."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner one night when we were apartment searching in the Middleton area. Had the friendliest server, who gave honest recommendations on what's best to try on the menu. The beer was excellent and the prices are pretty good. If you can, try the corned beef & cabbage rolls (appetizer). We loved them. Also worth noting they do have outside seating.  I've been here before for the live music, which is also great, but never for the food. I'll certainly be coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped by there for a few drinks before work dinner; Tuesdays are $2.50 pnts, which was a great deal! We went back on Wednesday and the prices were a lot higher. So if it was a Tuesday, I'd definitely go. Any other day? Probably not.   We were there early and there weren't that many people there, but we went back later (yes, we hot the bar twice in one night!) and there were a LOT more people there. The bartender on Tuesday was great. He was friendly and kept us refilled. Most of the stars are for Tuesday and the great bartender, although the food was good!  Wednesday we went back for dinner; no beer specials, but instead the special was whiskey and wine; I like wine okay but wasn't impressed with what was on special, and I don't like whiskey. The food was pretty good. I had fried cheese curds, which didn't squeak to my disappointment. I though cheese curds were the squeaky ones? Maybe they fried the squeak out of them? My friend had corned beef and cabbage egg rolls . Both were good! The waitress was just meh.  She wasn't  as helpful or as quick to keep us refilled as the bartender the night before.  They had a fire in the fire pit outside which felt fantastic to this cold Texan. I was not ready for the cold up there!!  I would go here here again, and probably will be back next year when the next work meeting happens! Although only if it's a Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Sunday, 11/3/2013 around 4:30 pm. Place was very slow. Place was clean but worn. Drinks took 10 minutes (no other patrons were waiting). Hostess seemed disinterested. Waitress was inexperienced. Food was well prepared and good quality for uninspiring menu. No paper towels in bathroom. On the South Side, there are so many options for food & drink, I'd steer away from this place and opt for another establishment that seems better prepared and better versed in customer service. $35 for 2 drinks and 2 \"starters\" wasn't unreasonable, but nothing about the place was equal to the price."}
{"text":"They no longer have the Monahan Meatloaf. The new version is good, but not the same. The clam chowder recipe is also diferent, and not as good. The shepards pie is awful. It is just potatoes and a lot of ground beef. It has little flavor. I like a shepards pie with some root veggies showing, and some taste. If you just like a lot of ground beef and mashed potatoes, this is the dish for you. I would never order it again. I think the place has gone down hill. Too bad they had to ruin their menu. It is also over priced."}
{"text":"Yeesh. Where to even begin.   My husband and I came here with four friends last night for Disney trivia night, and we will probably never go back. We got there early, our friends had gotten menus and waters for themselves, and we figured our waitress would be by in a moment once she saw we had arrived. After about fifteen minutes, she quickly walked past us saying she'd be with us shortly. Fifteen minutes after that, so a full half hour after we had sat down, she had still not even taken drink orders for us. I approached her as she was finishing up another table and very patiently and very kindly said, \"I'm really sorry, but we have been waiting for about a half hour to order.\" She interrupted me to say she'd be right there, and she followed me back to our table and just stood there. She did not say hello or \"what can I get for you?\" or \"sorry for the wait\".... Nothing. Just stood there staring at us with her pen on her paper waiting. So we ordered and asked for two more chairs for our two friends who had arrived. She said there were no more, so we asked neighboring tables ourselves and got them. After another 30 minutes, we got our cocktails and beers. My margarita had a bug in it. Of course our waitress never checked on us so I figured I'd never get a new drink if I waited for her to come back. I approached the bar and waited for a moment the bartender wasn't too busy. He was filling up two beers at the tap, which requires no concentration, so I again patiently and kindly asked for a new beverage whenever he had a free moment. He rolled his eyes at me, ignored me, and when I said again there was a bug in it and explained that my waitress never came back to our table so I couldn't ask her to bring it back, he simply yelled at me for approaching him while he was busy and walked away angrily. The two customers at the bar who I was standing between agreed that he had been extremely disrespectful. I walked away and just awkwardly stood beside my waitress at another table because that was the only way to get her attention. She was apologetic and got me a new drink. The new drink that came out was a totally different color and either a different drink entirely from what I ordered or he just spooned out the bug and dumped more colored flavor into the drink so I wouldn't expect anything. He was an ass to me, so I wouldn't be surprised if he just hadn't even made a new drink.   We each ordered one appetizer, and one friend ordered a burger. Chicken tenders, pretzels and beer cheese, and wings. That's all. I think it was around 9 before we got our food, and we ordered around 7:15. It was busy, but for that garbage food and not even real entrees? It should have been faster. Our pretzels were hard and way over-kneaded. The beer cheese did not have any of the promised Guinness flavor, and it had peppers in it, and really it tasted like Tostitos jarred queso from the grocery store, except slightly worse. Waiting two hours for that was extremely disappointing.   We never got water refills. She did check on us once after we got our food to see how it was, but that's it. Our empty plates and cups sat in front of us until 10:30 when we finally we able to leave. It took so long for her to bring us our checks, and even longer to run our cards through. One of my friends had to go up and ask another worker to help us out. After we finally found her to ask for our checks, during the ten minutes she took to print them, we were one of three tables left in the whole restaurant, her only table left, and she was laughing and talking to another worker the whole time. She got a $5 tip between the six of us for a bill around $75, and we all felt like we were being generous. I never tip that low because I respect servers and know it's their living, but I could give even the bare minimum 10% this time because she did not even do the bare minimum for us.   Now I know it was busy. I totally understand that. But I have been to busy restaurants before that were even more understaffed and our wait staff was always apologetic, kind, respectful, and able to do the bare minimum to get their job done. This was an absolute joke."}
{"text":"I will never come back here if I don't have to.  I dined at Claddagh on a weeknight with a small group of friends to participate in one of their trivia nights - Disney Trivia. I found the event via Facebook. We were excited for the disney-themed drinks and to play trivia.  We were seated and our waitress came over. We asked about the disney-themed drinks and she told us they would start at 7:00 when trivia started. So we had about 20 minutes until then but then she walked away and didn't let me order a water for the meantime. What a sign of things to come.  Our waitress finally came back forty minutes later. We quickly ordered food (sensing she wouldn't be back for a while). We asked about the disney-themed drinks again (which were advertised on the facebook event page) and she said they aren't doing them anymore because it was too busy. It wasn't too busy- the restaurant wasn't even full. It wasn't like people were clammoring at the bar. The issue was that the restaurant was severely understaffed. I believe there were two waitresses, one bartender and the manager serving the entire restaurant that night. Still... how hard is it to just rename some of your regular drinks after disney things. Whatever. So we ordered regular drinks.  We got our food. Well, some of it. My friend didn't get his burger. My other friend and I both ordered the boneless wings which turned out to definitely be Tysons chicken poppers tossed in bbq sauce and were cold. We sat there nibbling at our pretty inedible food wishing we had a drink to chase it down with. Finally one of my friends got up to go to the bar to ask for some waters and a manager saw him standing and said he would bring drinks. He brought two waters for four of us.   We never saw the waitress again until we signaled to her that we wanted our checks. My friends all had drinks they'd gotten from the bar and she brought my \"that blue drink\" into our section on a tray. She wandered around to all the tables, got distracted, put the tray down and I stared at my drink for a good 15 minutes before I decided to just assume it was mine and get up, walk across the room and grab the drink.  Worst service I have ever had at a restaurant. Oh and tables were blatantly cheating the entire time at trivia so that added another layer of absolute disappointment to our night."}
{"text":"No that I've had a chance to hit Brennan's, I'm dropping my review by one star... this representing about a 3.5.  Going to continue searching for my 5 star favourite in Cleveland..."}
{"text":"A must for St Patty's day, although I recommend not going for the straight corned beef and potatoes.  Good flavor for the corned beef but the cabbage nor the potatoes had seasoning nor butter.  Was just...ok.  I also went on St Patty's day during lunch.  I was served at the bar and it seemed as though I was always trying to capture one bartender's attention or another.  No one came to check on me unless I looked at them with longing eyes.  I know it was busy, in fact, THE busiest day for them (or one of them).  I will choose another day to try another menu item."}
{"text":"THis is just a solid Irish bar with good food. I only had several appetizers and some beers but I was impressed by the selection on the menu. From the other review I should have just went with one of them so I could have tried it. Alyways next time I guess."}
{"text":"This was a nice, pleasant place on Tuesday during happy hour to have some beers and a burger.   I saw in other reviews that there are $2.50 drafts on Tuesday at happy hour. This is a great bargain and I decided to come here to see if they still have this offer. As of November 2017, the drafts are still $2.50 on Tuesdays during happy hour. They have a fairly decent draft list, not a lot of unusual craft beers, but they did have Bell's Two Hearted Ale, which is one of my all time favorites.    I also liked the decor. It's a nicely done with a lot of dark wood to make it feel like an Irish pub. On Tuesday in late November it was a little quiet in the bar. Service was fine.   I had the Jameson burger. The burger itself was fine with a decent Jameson sauce and the beef tasted char broiled. The steak fries that came with it, though, tasted a little stale. The burger was probably a third pound--it didn't look big enough for a half pound.   I would come here again if I'm in the area, especially on a Tuesday. The Yelp cash back is an added bonus."}
{"text":"As a bar, Claddagh is fine.  If there is a special going on, then I'm sold.  Otherwise, it's a bit overpriced and a bit annoying when the music starts blasting.  On a nice afternoon, I can dig their fried food offerings on the small patio...pretzels, spinach and artichoke dip, corned beef and cabbage rolls...all of the fried faux-Irish food your heart desires."}
{"text":"The Wife and I went to Claddagh with friends on a Saturday night in mid-December 2012, and were sorely disappointed with the experience. We did not have any food, so this review is based solely on our experience while having a few drinks at the place.  Once we were seated, the server came over to take our drink orders. Curious, I asked how the hot apple cider (\"spiced rum & hot apple cider served with a cinnamon stick\") was, and our server told me that she didn't know because she doesn't drink and doesn't know anything about alcohol. OK, fine, it's totally fair to not drink (I didn't for a long time), but shouldn't the answer automatically be, \"It's great,\" when a customer asks how something you sell tastes?  Anyway, we proceeded to place our order, and she brought them out. Everything was fine, although The Wife's Claddagh Coffee Martini (vanilla vodka, baileys irish cream, kahlua, tia maria & coffee; garnished with coffee beans) was very sweet and, seriously, not very strong. We had our first round, and then it was time for round #2.  The server came back over to again take our order, and we had some questions. I asked, \"Your menu says 'We like to mix things up[, so] ask your server for more draft & bottle selections & our rotating & seasonal taps! Ask your server for additional choices due to limited supply.' So, what additional beers do you have on draft?\"  She replied with \"I, um, I don't know. I don't drink, so I don't know. I think it's, like, the usual ... Coors, Miller ...\" That annoyed me - the menu says to ask my server about additional drafts not listed on the menu, and my server doesn't know the answer to that really simple question.  Our friend then asked, \"OK, well, what seasonal brews do you have.\" She gave the same answer, \"I'm sorry, I don't know because I don't drink.\" At this point, I just gave up, and it has nothing to do with the fact that she doesn't drink. If you work as a server at a restaurant or bar, your job is to know the menu and the answers to customers' questions. If that means you need to know all the ingredients in a sandwich, you memorize 'em. If it means that, even as a nondrinker, you have to memorize the drinks menu, ESPECIALLY when you work at an Irish bar/restaurant that makes a majority of its money from alcohol sales. I mean, COME ON.  So, she lost out on what certainly would have been a higher-margin sale (I was interested in the Warsteiner seasonal, which is undoubtedly more expensive than the local New Belgium Fat Tire), and also indicated to me that the staff at Claddagh aren't well-trained.  Finally, for the 2nd round, The Wife ordered another Claddagh Coffee Martini, but directly asked the waitress to \"Please make it stronger than the last one.\" When the martini came out, it was all wrong. First, it was brought out in a snifter (according to the waitress, they had run out of martini glasses. What bar runs out of martini glasses?!). Second, there was a head on the martini (yes, that's right, the martini was frothy). Third, this one was as weak, if not weaker, than the first martini. But hey, at least it was only $7.50 per martini ... If you're interested, I posted a picture of the frothy martini in a snifter in Claddagh's photos (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yIWXPPGbePgPup6gz6ttNA?select=nHT8ay6gENgMwnPrIT-dtA#YVXoiIB4ZeKsexBWtGQLwA).  Needless to say, I won't ever suggest going to Claddagh, and will try to convince friends to go elsewhere if they invite me there."}
{"text":"Finding a restaurant with a fantastic shepherd's pie?  Priceless.  It's hard to find a solid Irish place in the midwest.  This place fits the bill very nicely.  Yes, you can get Jameson and Guinness.  Plus fish and chips, and all things Irish.   The menu is pretty solid.    Claddagh is a great choice for an authentic Irish dinner and a good pint to wash it down with."}
{"text":"I came to the claddagh when my parents came to town to visit. We were originally on our way to Hofbräuhaus when my dad, who loves anything and everything Irish, spotted the claddagh and wanted to go inside. We sat at the bar and ordered some drinks. The bartender who helped us was very nice and answered all of our questions. We also put in an order for scotch eggs. Not long after we ordered them, they came out and were excellent. If you are going to the claddagh, I highly recommend ordering the scotch eggs.   However, about a week later I returned to the claddagh with a few friends to watch the women's World Cup game, and did not have that same great experience. My boyfriend and I ordered two different draft beers, but when they came out we were given two of the exact same, watered down beer. The waiter did offer to switch the beers when we were dissatisfied with them, which I appreciated. We decided to order some food. I ordered the Irish beef stew. I do not recommend that to anyone. It was very plain and did not have any carrots in it that the menu said it would, and I spent the whole night curled up in my bed with the worst stomachache. I will probably go back to the claddagh because it had a great atmosphere and the staff was friendly, but I will make sure to order bottled drinks and stick to the scotch eggs."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food, atmosphere, patio, staff, drinks, soccer on screen (yippee). It would be a perfect 5 star place for me if they would stop allowing the staff to play their HORRIBLE music. and so loud.  I love it when they just play some Irish tunes and Britt-pop or just something from the mother land but it hurts to sit there listening to bad pop cheesy sexist new country super loud. It wasn't like this before. Me and my friends used to go there a lot for book club or to watch the games but we have severely cut down because of the terrible loud country music (and we are a big group). That's an Irish pub, not a dive bar in Dodgeville.  Stick with the traditional Irish tunes, guys, or play your distasteful country music a little quieter so we don't have to speak so loud to talk."}
{"text":"Not a very good place to visit for good food. Check in is lousy at its best and food is tasteless. Ordered Irish Beef Stew. Cold and mostly liquid. Mashed Potatoes were lumpy with very little of anything that resembled beef. Also ordered goat cheese and beets. Was like eating Elmer's glue. Sorry Elmer. Because of its location in an up and coming tourist trap, pricing is ridiculous. I am sure there are better choices for food somewhere in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"So tonight, my parents took me, and the girlfriend out for a late birthday (mine) celebration.   It was our first visit there, and boy was I impressed.  Let's point out a few key things!  The Seating.  The five of us got placed in this big booth that gave us plenty of leg room, and table space!  A plus on the seating arrangements!    The authentic Irish music:  David Bowie, Men Without Hats, Lou Reed.   When I hear these names I immediately think of Ireland!     The scenery:  It looks like an Irish pub, if you didn't realize the ceiling was painted to look like wood grain, you would have sworn it was an old Irish pub built inside a fairly new building!   Old books, paintings, photos and stained glass galore, and not to mention a fancy bar.  It's a pity I don't drink!    We picked two appetizers.  Cheese curds, and the loaded \"pub chips.\"    I myself tried the Veggie Burger.  It was hand made, and tasted quite good.  Like any authentic Irish Veggie Burger, it falls right out of the bun.   It comes with a side of pub chips (fries), which once again, they're spot on.  Ireland has a lot of potatoes.    My girlfriend had the authentic Irish Monte Cristo that came with the authentic chips as well.  I think everyone at the table was quite pleased with what they picked, and I would say I would come back again, plus the Cheeseburger in Paradise next door is out of business, so we wouldn't have deal with those parrot head wanna be beach bums!"}
{"text":"I stop here occasionally, but the menu keeps getting better and better!  Had the beef stew today and it is DELICIOUS. It's not really stew in the sense that you would think. It's more of a rich beef sauce with an equal amount of shredded beef. Included mashed potatoes in the middle with bread on the side to sop up the remaining sauce. Brie appetizer was totally worth it.  Service was quick and very pleasant,  but it's a quiet Sunday afternoon.   Check this place out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I hosted a bridal shower in their small back room this past weekend and it was a wonderful experience! The waitress Ali was incredibly attentive and helpful- from setting up and decorating to serving the guests to helping clean up and bring gifts out to the car. The food was great and all of our guests seems very pleased. Thank you all for providing a beautiful venue and great service for the bride! I absolutely will recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Food here is great and the portions are generous.  I particularly recommend the fish and chips as well as any of the fancy Mac and cheese,  be advised the mac n cheese side dish. Is very generous."}
{"text":"Claddagh's needs to do something here. They have a great location in the south side works, and really that's about it.   I came here to watch the UEFA Championship final and wasn't impressed at all. The place was a little packed with soccer hooligans, which is awesome, but it wasn't overwhelmingly busy. Our waiter was AWFUL, almost pathetic. It literally took my friend a half hour to get a single beer. I had enough and went to the bar and started ordering drinks. You snooze, you lose my friend;  (you're not getting any of my dough if you can't bring a beer over for a half hour, no matter how busy you are.)  I ordered a Reuben Patty Melt, which sounded pretty cool. After eating it, I was dumbfounded. The sandwich was miniature and only had corn beef and coleslaw on it? WTFFF!!! Give me something more please! Separate yourselves from the million other restaurants that serve Reuben sandwiches.   I left Claddagh's thinking, \"You call yourselves an Irish Pub??.\" If I was Irish, I would definitely feel bad that all the non-Irish people would come here thinking it of as traditional Irish pub."}
{"text":"The food was very good and it's a cool building, but the service was terrible.  The hostess was not at all friendly and we were seated at a very uncomfortable high top table and got some attitude when we asked to move.  There was hardly anyone in there, so there were plenty of regular tables.  The server didn't even ask if we wanted refills or dessert, just slapped the bill on the table.  I actually was going to get both, but fine I won't spend any more money there."}
{"text":"Gallway clam chowder, Irish shepherd pie, and Kaliber (NA) beer made by Guinness, with good Irish music, great wait staff. Loving this place!"}
{"text":"Cute. Sort of a 1990s developer's take on an old Irish pub. Fireplace, live music, pub food. It was all good, but none of it was great. I'm not sure why people rave about the corned beef appetizer rolls -- deep frying  beef with cheese is just , well, gross."}
{"text":"Claddagh, you fiery lass. You were quick, hot, and sloppy. I just about buried my face in your hot fish and chips not long after I sat down, and on St. Paddys day too! Thank the good Lord for feastdays, amirite!? Not to mention how you slipped me an irish car bomb hassle free, courtesy of one of your many regulars who was all too willing to put it on his tab after being put under the wiles of my beautiful accomplice. You were loud, boisterous, and perfect for the one night stand i was looking for. Xoxo"}
{"text":"The Patio. Literally the only reason this doesn't have 1 star. Total disappointment on all other aspects.  When this place opened and for maybe the year after that I would go after a good workout at the gym with friends and we loved the steak salad....around the time they turned over managers and the menu changed we stopped going. This was maybe 5yrs ago.  Last summer I went maybe once or twice for the patio. The one and only reason I'll go when it's a nice out. Our waitresses were awful. Seemed like they would much rather be somewhere else. Rude and not friendly at all. I get it. Some people have a bad day. But you work in the service industry. As I have work in both retail and the food industry, I can tell you being friendly and/or just a smile will go a long way.  So. FF to last week. The first nice week we may have had, I wanted to go to a patio. Deciding to give it another go, we walked in the front door. No greeter. So we wander past the bar to the patio. Crickets. Where was everyone. There were 4 tables seated all over the patio so we decided to sit down. Of course we would be noticed by a waitress at some point. THERE SHE IS! As she does her rounds to her other tables she doesn't make eye contact and never stops by. What the heck!!!!! At this point it has become comical. We decided jumping the fence for Cheesecake Factory might be a good move. One more chance we decided we had to give if only for entertainment purposes. Out she comes again! Brings checks drops them at the tables and eventually goes back in. At this point 2 other couples have seated themselves. That was our cue. See ya!  This is a long review if you can call it that. It's sad because this venue has so much potential with the beautiful patio, but looses all credibility on service. Awful. The food has always been alright and I'm one to give too many chances but at this point I'm done with this place for awhile."}
{"text":"Pretty great Irish chain restaurant. Have always enjoyed dining here. Fish fry is very good. Very friendly and skilled staff. Nice outdoor seating during the summer too."}
{"text":"Yes if you have ever wanted an entire fish laying across your plate here you go. Massive fish and chips, sort of expensive but not ridiculous. I came on St. Patrick's day weekend and there was a live Irish band and they were drinking beer while they played and it was fun. It was pretty loud. Overall it was a good time and I would come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary and it turned out to be a good choice.  The bar tender was polite and prompt with our meals and drinks.  The restaurant was clean and quiet. I got the traditional shepherd's pie which was excellent because it tasted homemade and wasn't too salty like some shepherds pies tend to be.  My husband got the award winning fish and chips and there was a plentiful amount of fresh flaky fish to eat. The irish soda bread that is served with the meals is nothing to brag about.  We both got the traditional banoffee pie for dessert and regretted it only because we couldve shared one piece between the two of us.  The desserts are definitely shareable in size.  This pie was perfectly delicious. A word of caution.  If you aren't keen on sweets, dont get this. Its as sweet as desserts come.  We will be back.  This restaurant didnt disappoint."}
{"text":"Yeah. Where do I start? This is an Applebee's with Guiness on tap. I suspect the kitchen consists of a deep fryer and a burner to heat up water for their boil in bag cuisine.    The only dish of interest is their fish and chips. I have had it 4 times. The first time it was very good. The last 3 were  soggy. Like they turned on the oil when they got my order.    The service is either rushed or aloof. The manager seems daffy. At least tonight.  I won't be back until...  So what WILL be in this space in 6 months?"}
{"text":"We were looking for a fish fry on a Friday night. This location was recommended however it was Cod. It was good. The Scottish eggs are way over priced.... 2 eggs for $9 is steep.  Service was good be the restaurant is pricey for my taste. This takes some of the joy out of you meal when the price versus value is exceeded. Service was good and quick however it was too professional for me. More act than personal. Mind you it was good service. We were looking for a more authentic local place typical Wisconsin fish fry.

{"text":"Popped in for a beer before a movie. The bartender said I could taste anything I wanted. (Does that include ALL of the beers? Will have to go back to check.) When I ordered a Big Hop he offered up a tasting of another hoppy beer they had on draft for something new. Oh, and all of your beers are $4 for happy hour? Okay, things are going good for you bartender.  Ordered a simple burger. It came out quickly and was delish. Then to top off the night, the bartender comes around with a stack of old school Guinness posters and starts offering them to his customers. I left pretty impressed, hands full."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant with my kids three times. Latest visit was just ok. Although I have to say our server was very good. At the time she had our table and three others, two where groups of 8+. She was very attentive and polite. Now to the reason for my review; I've never had a salad at this place and I ordered the wilted spinach salad with salmon. First off I was VERY disappointed with the portion size, especially when it cost 14.00 dollars. The plate was very flat and held maybe a couple of handfuls of spinach. All of the other toppings were also very scarce (tomatoes, cheese, etc. The biggest disappointment was the portion size of the salmon though. Very small for a salad costing that much. My son ordered a burger with onion rings, which we had had before and as usual that was very good. The bill came out to almost 40 dollars but I left the place very hungry!"}
{"text":"Fish and chips were cooked well and the portion was large.  It's got that chain atmosphere - so don't come here expecting a small pub feel.  It was mostly empty on this Friday night - not sure if that's the norm or not as this was our first visit.  We'd come back again for the big portions of beer battered fish and chips."}
{"text":"I have been going to Cladagh due to my friends always wanting to go there for the pint night ( which isn't even cheap). however, I hate the place, The tables are disguising, you can peel off whatever coating they put on top of them, the beer is always watered down, and the food is something that comes out of a microwave.     I wish I could give a positive comment about this place but I cant. Just go somewhere."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy that there aren't many people at the bar during the game....they have a great beer selection.  The food is not so good, Knowing that,  I ordered a salad.   The hard boiled egg was green, the chicken was burnt, and the dressing was too sweet to add to the salad.  I ate  1/2 of it...sent the rest back."}
{"text":"Always friendly and accommodating, great beer, fun atmosphere... Me thinks yes ;-)"}
{"text":"I travel here from time to time and love this place. Bourbon?  Check. Darts? Check. Fish and Chip?  Absolutely.  Great bar atmosphere in a cool little shopping area. Ever in Madison stop by this place and get a beer. Tell them Glenn sent you and they won't know what the hell you are talking about. Ha. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If I were to rate this place based solely on my first visit, I would probably give it a 4 star. On my first visit (~ 2 years ago), we had a good experience here, both in food and service. I ordered the fish & chips and it was excellent. The fish tasted fresh and had just the right amount of batter. The service was also quick and pleasant. I was here for a second time recently and my experience was not the same. I came here with my gf on a not so busy Saturday afternoon for lunch. Although we were seated quickly and our order was placed, our food took close to half an hour to arrive. I ordered the fish & chips again and my gf had the shepherd's pie. This time, the fish and chips came out saggy and the fish tasted a bit under cooked. My gf's shepard's pie wasn't that great either; I've made better myself... Perhaps this mishap was just a one time thing, but the inconsistency is not tolerable."}
{"text":"Ok so I felt compelled to write and update. We've had two parties here and they've hosted us well. Kept drinks refilled and catered our small parties without any troubles. Fish fry leaves a lot to be desired, however everything else is pretty good. Plus they have Spotted Cow on tap."}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh (I was born & raised here...lived here for 36 years), and 7 of my friends & I decided to try this place.  Our waitress was PHENOMENAL! She went above and beyond her job duties. She was super friendly and very attentive.   I wanted to try a different drink and I had the Blackberry Lemon Drop. It was delicious (and sweet, so if that's not your thing, you may be disappointed). I loved it!  I ordered the meatloaf and it was very good. The veggies that came along with it were also good.   The mashed potatoes were cold. Not lukewarm, but cold. This really was disappointing and if they had been warmer, I probably would have given this place 4 stars instead of 3.  The place was lively and there were a lot of folks hanging out at the bar. It's a very large place; plenty of area for a lot of people.   I did go back & forth on what to give this restaurant overall. 3 or 4. Truthfully, I'd give it 3 1/2, but since I have to choose, I decided on 3 not based on the cold potatoes, but based on how strongly I felt that I would return. When I thought of it that way, I decided a 3 was more appropriate. While nothing was AWFUL, I just think there are better choices in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Staying nearby and hungry so didn't want to wait long.  So I wasn't expecting too much since This was about the only restaurant with immediate seating available.  We had probably one of worst seats in the place -on people's walkway to the bathrooms and next to the kitchen area and to side where we couldn't quite see any of the TVs which were tuned to the Hockey playoffs.  As I said though we were hungry so didn't quibble .  My husband had a draft and I asked for water since I'm a Diet Coke fan and Pepsi just doesn't cut it.  ( strike 2 lol) .  I was happy that they hadn't added lemon to the water without my requesting it.   I ordered a cup of New England clam chowder -- strangely the orangest New England style I've ever seen .  It had far more celery and onions than potatoes or clams .  Worse - it was extremely salty -and I am no stranger to the salt shaker!  The accompanying bread only slightly lessened the tAste and I drank half my water right away despite ingesting less than half the cup - my husband did finish it for me and agreed with my opinion even though he is more of a salt fan than I am.  He pronounced his monte cristo sandwich pretty good ( which is why this gets any stars at all) and it was accompanied by tasty steak fries .  I had fish tacos and I must admit that a friend asked me - what were you thinking getting that at an Irish pub ?- but I figure you shouldn't have something on menu if you can't make it well.  AnywAy - the fish tacos were pretty much tasteless and the fish was slightly undercooked although there was a good amount of cod on the three tacos.  Interestingly considering my soup review -it didn't even taste like there was any salt on them -much less any other seasoning .  I had my fish grilled not fried and there was no sign of a seared edge, they were served with cabbage , salsa (? Just seemed like rAw tomato ) , avocado ( a good amount ) and a \"cilantro cream\" which was pretty tasteless -- I only even took a bite of the second taco to see if it had any flavor at all.  Pretty much I filled up on my hubby's fries .   Our waiter seemed very friendly when he brought the check but otherwise never inquired as to our enjoyment of our meal -- id definitely have shared my opinion and perhaps picked something else if opportunity had been given but he only returned after we were finished so there was no making it right .  Next time I'd wait in line at one of the other places -- or just eat something from the hotel quick shop even .  A bag of chips and a snickers would have been more satisfying and much cheaper ."}
{"text":"I love this place and brought a lot of my friends for the Fish Fry. I am a big fan of Fish and Chips. After living in UK for many years I have been trying to find Fish and Chips to something close to what I used to find in UK. I think that Claddagh so far has the best Fish and Chips I have tried so far. If you get a chance to sit by the fireplace then you are going to have a great evening!"}
{"text":"Not a great experience. No hostess to greet/seat us when we arrived. After waiting 5 minutes we were finally seated. Had the pub fries and they were obviously the frozen variety. Come on...how hard is it to cut & fry a potato? Had the signature burger. It was not seasoned and bland. I suspect it was frozen like the fries. The bun was slightly soggy. The hamburger itself was medium as requested but not cooked properly. The only positive is the decor. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Starving in the southside area of town, my brother and I decided to meet a friend for dinner. I am pleased that we went here! A healthy variety of beers on tap, true Irish fare on the dinner menu and even soccer on the televisions! I had the \"Full Irish Breakfast\" complete with banger sausage, black and white pudding and a fried tomato. It was heavenly and goes excellently with a frosty pint of Guinness. The wait staff was also extremely friendly and happy to bring a fresh beer over before the other was finished. They were quite busy that night but it was refreshing to see them on top of things. If you're in the mood for good food and great beer at a fair price, I recommend this place. I know I'll be back there next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Go here to watch Man City games. Place has always had good service, at least the bar does. I've never actually been there to sit down for dinner. Decent number of good European beers on tap (Stella, Newcastle, Bass, etc.). I don't know why some of those other reviews were so harsh. This place does brisk business, so it can't be that bad. I enjoy myself when I'm here and plan on going back again."}
{"text":"I tend to avoid chain restaurants in favor of more local places, but since moving to the far west side, this has been a bit more difficult. I now rationalize my occasional visits here by only going when there's a draw besides the food and drinks, and that makes it worthwhile. Just don't go on St. Patrick's day, unless a jam-packed anxiety-inducing fiasco is your kind of scene.  The ambiance is your standard Irish pub fare - dark wood, heavy tables and chairs, a fireplace of sorts, and random Celtic symbols and signs all over. There are TVs sprinkles throughout the restaurant, mostly concentrated in the bar area. They're often showing international soccer games, though they'll generally show any popular sport, so I've come here for the occasional NFL or NBA game. They don't have the sound on, but they do use closed-captioning (which, incidentally, makes Joe Buck's observations seem even stupider than usual, but I digress). The restaurant itself seems pretty clean, but that's a bit difficult to discern between all of the dark surfaces and dim lighting.  The staff is usually cheerful and happy to serve. On occasion, I've been in when the host(ess) is nowhere to be found, but that usually rectifies itself when a server notices me standing there waiting to be seated. They are fairly attentive and helpful, although I was a bit alarmed last week. A bat had gotten in through an open window (this would be one of many reasons why screens on windows are a very good idea in a restaurant), and it was obviously in distress, trying to get out. Bats happen to be my favorite animal, so I was happy when it was able to find its way out by itself and fly off, although not before our server went on a rant to us about how all bats carry rabies and she wanted a tennis racket to \"finish it off.\" Yikes. Occasionally a company will be doing a promo event, so it's a little bracing when the reps come up to your table to bray a commercial for their product. On the other hand, I've gotten free beer samples and swag (like key chains), so there is an upside. They also have Team Trivia of WI every Thursday night, and the host is fantastic.  Most of the food is good, but not great. One standout dish, which is especially fantastic during a hot summer evening, is the duck salad. The duck isn't overcooked or greasy, though there isn't too much of it on the salad. The tomatoes, sun-dried cranberries, and oranges complement it well, adding a nice combination of sweet and tart flavors. I recommend the cran-raspberry vinaigrette for a dressing. The Galway and Fruits on the Green salads are also recommended for summer eating. The loaded pub chips are good for sharing, but not as good as the ones at the Brocach (although you can make them better by asking for BBQ sauce and ranch dressing instead of just ketchup). The fried pickles are pretty good, largely because the pickles are in chip form instead of spear form. That equals more crispy goodness and less \"sweet Christ on a cracker, that's a torpedo of boiling pickle juice that just burnt my entire mouth.\" The spinach and artichoke dip is tasty but VERY heavy; I'd save it for cold, rainy fall evenings. Other go-to dishes of mine include the Shepherd's Pie and Chicken Curry. The French Onion Soup isn't bad, but it's quite salty. The Corned Beef & Cabbage is a fairly bland snooze-fest. If you want a burger, go Jameson Burger or go home. The beer selection isn't fantastic, but there's some local stuff on tap. One surprise I found on their generally-overpriced menu is a reasonably-priced flight of whiskeys that were fairly tasty.  Overall, this isn't a place I dream about, but it's worth the occasional visit with friends when you're looking to watch a game or play some trivia."}
{"text":"Customer Service: 1 Value: 3 Food Quality: 3  This review is based off of two different visits about 3 weeks apart from each other.   The first time I visited I sat at the bar on a weeknight at about 830pm.  I found the bartender to be very inattentive and spent more time on her cell phone, and watching a reality show that was on the TV at the bar, rather than paying attention to customers at the Bar.   The second time I visited there were two ladies working the bar area and this was on a Friday at 2pm. There were two people at the bar including myself and both of these ladies were also having to seat people as they came into the restaurant, as well as run to the back to get food and bring it back to the front. Both ladies spent time laughing amongst each other rather than do simple things such as BRING a menu to the people at the bar, ask if you would like anything to drink... The basics!   For this being an \"Irish Bar w/real Irish Food\" it was very bland. I tried multiple \"Irish Dishes\" across my two visits here and each of them were very bland. The only thing that had any flavor was their \"Traditional Banoffee Pie\".   This would be an OK restaurant to sit down at enjoy some drinks, however due to the Customer Service I received on both visits, I can't recommend this establishment or return any further patronage to it."}
{"text":"Authentic Irish restaurant serving traditional foods and also delicious American classics! Great atmosphere and good entertainment most nights. Service is great and with such a huge range of tap beers to choose from you're bound to have a good time!"}
{"text":"It's feast or famine in terms of aweomeness.  A few years ago we had my grandfathers 80th bday in their back room and they could not have been better to deal with.  Last weekend I tried to get a drink at the bar here, and they wouldn't serve me.  Could NOT get their attention.  I was holding a $20 and I have a 36DDD bra size.  Not that it helps, but come on that helps.  The food is standard bar swill, but usually the service is good and the food can be expected to be pretty alright.  I do enjoy their outdoor seating, and its a lot less crowded than the Hofbrau Haus."}
{"text":"Good spot for late drinks and beers, but the food wasn't that great.   Initially when we saw the menu, we got excited because it all sounded pretty good. But when our food came, it didn't live up to the hype of the menu. The bread on my sandwich was stale, and his Reuben was extra greasy.  Granted, we are pretty late at night and had already imbibed enough that any food was ok in the moment. But the next morning we both agreed we had been disappointed."}
{"text":"I occasionally come here ONLY for $2.50 pint Tuesdays. And if im lucky, there will be a few exceptional crafts on draft. Thats as good of a deal as I've found in this city. The food on the other hand is downright disappointing. Iv had a few different meals here and all subpar. I ordered (soggy) fries once and i swear my frozen ones at home turn out better. And i had been drinking! That goes to show how bad they are.   Moral of the story: Come on a Tuesday and throw back a few pints. Oh, and eat somewhere else before you go."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. I've been here several times and will continue to go back. I recently had a surprise dinner for my husband's birthday here as well. My only complaint was that the room we reserved was very small. It said it seated 20 people but it was pretty tight. However, I didn't have to pay for the room itself so I really can't be mad. And we had such a good time that it didn't matter after a while."}
{"text":"After experiencing what non-chain real Irish pubs are like (Pipers, Harp and Fiddle, Flannery's and PJ McIntyre's in Cleveland), I cannot support a \"chain\"... kind of how I was never a fan of Fado in the past.   My most recent experience here was for a party for a Christening.  The food was bland in general, and their chips just are missing something.  If you are an Irish Pub, you would think Fish and Chips was something that would be gotten \"right\"... not here.  The menu changes like people change their underwear too.  I think every time I have been here it has been very different.     The only thing I think that is a plus about this place is Tuesday pint night... cannot go wrong at 2.50 (but I do not drink beer much so this is hardly a draw), and the patio in the warmer months."}
{"text":"The fish and chips taste pretty good.  But the service is the pits and I don't think they turn on the heat in there. It's always freezing. Save your money and skip this place."}
{"text":"Came here after work with some coworkers.  The service was great.  We ordered some appetizers and everyone else got some drinks.  I can't really review a place by a few appetizers and water!  This wouldn't be my place of choice for dinner, so I am not sure if I would go back to try their food- not really my scene.    By service alone, this place is a solid 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Last Thanksgiving brunch for us. Reservation for 11. They sat us down thirty minutes late. No silverware. Broken window blind and sunshine made half the table useless. Way understaffed. Had to ask for water three times. Really disappointed"}
{"text":"The Jameson burger. Buy it. Eat it. Fall in love."}
{"text":"we stopped in last night for a later dinner. despite living a block away, this was our first time.   for an app, we ordered the Corn Beef & Cabbage Eggrolls. In may sound odd but it was delicious. It was served with thousand island which also sounds odd but trust me, the flavors work well together. I absolutely loved it. I can easily see myself here grabbing that app and a beer.  For dinner, I ordered the Shepard's Pie Mac----  ground beef, lamb, peas with their delicious, creamy homemade mac on top (made with Wisconsin cheddar omg!!) I loved the entree.  My bf ordered the Award Winning Fish & chips. The piece of fish was huge and the fries were battered great.  Suprisingly our meals were so big & filling we each became over it quickly and switched halfway thru. I enjoyed the fish option. The Shepard's pie mac was good, but very filling due to the Wisconsin cheddar. I enjoyed the fish dinner.. Although the Cole slaw was dry.  Sam was our server. She did an amazing job at first but disappeared after our order was in. Hostess delivered our food and we didn't see our server until after our plates were cleared (after the plate switch of course Lol)   Def would have been a 4 star review if service was consistent the entire visit.  Resturaunt is roomy and played fun alternative music"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Jameson Burger and friendly staff. The atmosphere is not bad and pricing is in line with similar establishments."}
{"text":"Had a craving for fish and chips, so I stopped in for lunch today. The food was right on. Great lunch portion, and didn't take overly long. The service wasn't amazing, but nothing I would complain about. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"If this restaurant only sold their corned beef and/or fish & chips, I'd give it a 5-star.  I've been here about 4 times now, and all I've realized the only dishes my friends and I have liked are their corned beef (it's realllllllllyyy good, but a super small portion) & fish and chips (my friend digs this dish!).   My first time here, my friend kept raving about their fish & chips, so I came and ordered some beef clay pot. Not that good. Then the second time, I decided on something more..authentic, the corned beef & cabbage. it was SOOO good. But I felt like I paid $20 to eat an appetizer size dish.  PROs: corned beef & cabbage, fish & chips  CONs: slow service, no other good food yet, weird room layout  I might come back here another time to see if I can change my mind about it, but this is a place I wouldn't highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad. They do a good pour on Guinness at the very least. Service was good, attentive wait staff and someone was always coming around to clear plates or check on us. Menu is kind of weird, for an \"Irish pub\" they have more burgers and pasta dishes than Irish food. The food is decent, not awesome, not terrible, just decent. But it's in a nice area and their outdoor seating is nice for this time of year (June)."}
{"text":"Came in here after a subpar dinner at another establishment.  The place looked great.  Nice Irish pub feel to it.  We got a bar table and enjoyed a few drinks.  Good beer selection.  We looked at the menu but the recent memory of our dinner turned us off.  The menu seemed to have good pub fare.  The people were in great spirits which made our stay even better."}
{"text":"Alright, I am rusty at reviewing but this visit compelled me to share. My family chose Claddagh for a birthday party and we were a large group, but the restaurant seems set up for such events with open spaces to connect long tables. The atmosphere was friendly and eclectic, what one would seek in an Irish theme pub. And our server was truly sweet and accommodating. The stars are for the food.  Never have I met a meatloaf I have not liked.(My father's do not cout.) Bob Evan's take out is better meatloaf! Tasteless, a sad color and dry with gravey gelled by a heat lamp, I was confused. Shouldn't a pub put more love into their comfort food? The choice of vegetables may have been my fault. They had a funky smell and a sour taste that made me, and my test subject brother, make faces. The mashed potatoes were a boring consolation. I pilfered fries for a meal.  When my uncle's steak was mostly gristle, my grandmother did not even finish her fish, and my brother asked for food on the way home I knew I was not the only one wondering what's up?"}
{"text":"Well I still pretty much wish IRA would Car Bomb  Legacy Village back to the Stone Age. The parking is a Cluster FCUK,  unless you park at Claddagh.  I have to raise this place 2 stars. I have been here 4x since and not with dates!  The Yelp event here was fantastic!  This is one of the few places here where the crowd is not super annoying! Yeah its a chain, but it is best one in this soccer mom infested playground! Sorry sis I still love ya!   But let me start with Fridays. 1/2 price bottles of wine. You start out at the Whole Foods 5x5 Fridays for all you Loooooooosers it's  5 wine samples for 5$ and a wine glass (but wait there is more)  all the Soccer Moms you handle. After this head over here for 1/2 price bottles of wine. What can be better than that?  Maybe I should bring a date here. Maybe I should not advertise this in my review so she does not think I'm a total cheap ass : ) However I'm willing to buy the 1st 2 bottles!  Yeah the food. You already know the fish and chips are great.  The meat loaf dinner is pretty fantastic as well.  They stick it on the grill so it has a nice flavor. Or at least they did it the last couple of times I visited.  The service has been really great as well. Most of the  servers I have had the pleasure to help me, will pretty much steer you away from the food that have Areas of Opportunity."}
{"text":"This place has a fun atmosphere and made a good location for a rehearsal dinner.  The side room where the party was set up was services by two waitresses that were very friendly and attentive.  When the meals started coming out the two waitresses were quite busy but seemed to stay on top of everything .  We were offered a menu with four choices and I chose a chicken dish that had cheese and broccoli with it.  The dish was a decent size but lacked some flavor.  It came with mashed potatoes that seemed to have a lot of garlic so if you do not like garlic be aware.  My husband got the shepherds pie which he seemed to really enjoy and a few others at our table had the fish and chips which was a large piece of fish that seemed to steal the show on that plate and I heard good things about it so maybe another time I would try that!"}
{"text":"Had to listen to table behind us scream, swear, sing and yell the entire meal causing a scene. Our server said there was nothing she could do. Terrible food didnt help. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"at first I was a little worried. I don't like traditional Irish food and There was also some confusion about whose table we were at. After that was finally figured out the service was pretty good. The server was friendly. We got the bruschetta as an appetizer. It was good. Nothing to special and the bread could have been a little crispier. I got the hummus platter as my entree. Wow this was amazing. It was so good! Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"A mediocre restaurant, one of a number of chain places, which exist only because the landlords are anxious to fill space.  The selection of items is ordinary and consists of several unhealthy choices.  Service is good, but is far better than the food served.  It is not impossible to have a chain restaurant which serves good food.  Panera, Cheesecake Factory and Chili's are examples."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here so can't comment on the food, but I was here for the $2.50 Tuesday beer special to watch a game and had a great time.  Easy angles to see the TVs, friendly staff, and $2.50 beers!"}
{"text":"As a regular here for about 6 years, I recognize that Claddagh is very much a mixed bag.  On one hand, they have one of the absolute best beer specials in the city. On Tuesdays, they have $2.50 pints all day and post a great selection of local craft beer, and imported Irish ales, stouts, and ciders. I have taken the utmost advantage of this special for years, and even during the rest of the week, drink prices are reasonable. The indoor seating is plentiful and the decor allows the ambience to remain comfortable despite the number of tables. The bar is huge and has TVs regularly playing sports, including soccer, whenever they can. They have ample outdoor seating around two sides of the building and frequently have a fire pit glowing in the evenings. The bathrooms are regularly cleaned. On the other hand, pretty much everything else that makes a restaurant good, Claddagh does poorly. The food is mediocre at best, mostly sub-par, and always overpriced. The mac and cheese is basically a thick soup with generic flavor and the potato skins are bland, leathery and clearly frozen. The pub chips are decent, but \"loading\" them does little to justify their existence. I only recommend their Paddy Mac sandwich, only because it's basically impossible to screw up a Reuben.  The level of service is also inconsistent. Unfortunately, the servers don't stand much of a chance. The restaurant is often understaffed and the turnover rate seems to be high (even for a restaurant), so service can be slow and the staff is occasionally harried. On a few occasions, I have been forced to physically track down a staff member in order to be seated at a table or pay a bill. When servers were not rushed, however, my service has been quality.  So if you're in the mood for some Irish fare, dine elsewhere, but be sure to come for drinks afterwards and sit around the fire with friends!  TLDR: come for the great beer, leave for better food"}
{"text":"Had my moms retirement party here and the service and food was outstanding! We go back for every celebration! Can't go wrong with a burger....delicious!"}
{"text":"How anybody has ever given this place a 5 is beyond me!  Dirty silverware, HORRIBLE drinks (my \"Irish coffee\"  tasted of water and ... perhaps a hint of old coffee, not to mention cold) and inedible food.  Can't really say much for the service, my waiter was obviously new and one can't blame him for that."}
{"text":"I enjoy the general atmosphere at Claddagh. Feels like you are really in an authentic pub in Ireland. The music is great and the outside patio has great scenery. I came with a friend for the first time after driving past it for a number of years.   Aside from the positives of Clauddagh I must say that I have never received worse service at a bar and I have been to many bars all over the country. We tipped the bartender with pig tails and a Chinese tattoo on the back of her neck several times for our beers. Soon after we were not being served despite being seated directly at the bar. Soon after it became apparent that we were being blatantly ignored. We had several friends join us who were also being ignored and the wait time for a drink became 20+ minutes.   When she was finally forced to address us she told us we were being ignored due to \"not tipping\" which was both incorrect and even if it was, it should not have affected the service of our friends who had yet to order their first drink. This lovely bartender also made the note to alert the other bartenders not to serve us because of this fact. Being a bartender does not give you the right to exude a complete lack of disregard for a customer, ESPECIALLY if it's dependent on what YOU think YOU deserve as a tip. I definitely will not be returning after this experience, would've been a slam dunk if it wasn't for this obviously immature and greedy excuse for a bartender."}
{"text":"I must say that it is quite a coincidence that when we were seated in the dining area that the televisions were showcasing the Florida VS Pittsburgh hockey game.  I had no idea the game was going to be on and it was definitely interesting -- a state against a city and the city winning!  This Irish Pub is located in Southside Works and is very new.  I had been wanting to stop by for some time and found -- after several failed, late night attempts -- the dining room was still serving.  The interior was rusticated (an engineered rustic feeling) and had several dining/gathering areas organized around the central, large bar with a private dining area in the rear.  Never having been to Ireland, I shan't vouch for its authenticity.  While there is exterior seating, I would not recommend in the winter -- it's frickin' cold!  Having seen the menu many times on previous attempts to eat here, I already knew what I wanted and ordered accordingly:  Boneless Wings (Hot/Piquant) Onion soup Bangers and mash Black Velveteen (1/2 cider and 1/2 beer) Coke  The wings and the soup came out rather quickly.  The French Onion soup was typical of what you might find at any other restaurant; but it tasted good and the onions were nice and tender.  The Boneless wings were a bit odd.  While they were slightly piquant, they were far from being buffalo.  It tasted more like a spicy honey-mustard-garlic sauce; with that being said, I really did enjoy the flavor of the boneless wings even though they were not what I was expecting.  While eating the wings and soup, my Black Velveteen arrived.  I have never had a cider mixed with a dark beer.  It was a tad odd at first, but I did find that I did like it.  As I nursed the large container of cider-beer, our bangers and mash arrived.  This was a large plate of food and I was happy that the plate was being split between two people.  Even splitting the dish, it was too much food.  The bangers are not the best I have ever tried, but they were still fairly decent and better than others I have had in Southside.    I cannot attest to the authenticity of the \"Irish-ness\" of this restaurant as I have never been to Ireland; what I do know is that I enjoyed what I ordered."}
{"text":"Your standard Irish Pub, this place will not disappoint.  It's got the ambiance and atmosphere of a good Old Irish Pub.  A decent bar menu and beer selection add to this place.    The location is a bit out of the way and the service can be wanting.  If you want a better Irish pub, hit the capital and head to the Brocach."}
{"text":"Pretty cool Irish restaurant. We got stuck in the very back corner by the waiter station, which wasn't ideal, but instead of hearing the Irish music they were playing we got to hear the wait staff discuss Pokemon go.  The food was good but not great. The wife had the shepherds pie, it was a tad bit too salty. I had the generals meatloaf and I really liked it, especially the gravy. My daughter had the beef stew. It was basically a pot roast with no stew. It was good and she liked it, just not what she expected. The Irish mules are pretty good if you are interested. For dessert it was bread pudding. My wife liked it, my daughter not so much.  It's a fun place, with good drinks and a great atmosphere, just not in the corner. Will definitely try this again."}
{"text":"Luve Irish music on the weekend.  Great place to sit back and have some nice drinks with friends to end your evening."}
{"text":"When it comes to Legacy Village tripe, this is my #1 choice.  Damning by faint praise?  Yes.  But, unfortunately, in my line of work, there are a lot of occasions for lunch or dinner at a restaurant that is on the \"better\" end of junk chains.  I choose Claddagh over Cheesecake Factory any time I am faced with that terrible decision.  There is a lot of truly bad food on the menu, but there are some decent things, as well, earning Claddagh an \"A-OK\" rating.  I've never had bad service here, but never been overly impressed by anything.  In the absence of a legitimate Irish Pub in the 5-10 mile radius surrounding my home (South Euclid), if I want a plate of fish & chips and a Smithwicks or a Black & Tan, this place will do.  I had a business lunch here the week between Christmas and New Year's, and had a nice plate of fish & chips.  It was fine.  Maybe even good.  Not great.  One thing that I like here that I can't get anywhere else are the wings.  They're smallish, but I love the flavor of the \"Shamrock\" (gag) sauce.  It's greenish... ish.  Not appetizing to look at.  But delicious.  Certainly a personal taste thing, they're not much like your typical hot wing.  But then again, hot wings aren't really all that Irish, are they?  The Shepherd's pie pretty well sucks, the Guinness Stew pretty well sucks, the Bangers pretty well suck, and someone at my table once ordered the grilled chicken breast and it looked completely pathetic.  It was reported to be completely pathetic.  I did not try it.  But, as a purpose-destination for me (beer, wings, fish/chips), I kind of like it.  I can say, unequivocally, that if there was a legitimate Irish Pub nearby, I'd never set foot in here again.  For what that's worth..."}
{"text":"Dined here recently with a group of folks celebrating a graduation. The place was so noisy it was almost impossible to conduct a conversation with even the person next to you. I had the fish and chips. The fish was good but the \"chips\" were tasteless and mushy. My husband had the ribs which did not taste fresh to me--tasted like they were cooked a day or two or more prior then slopped with a ton of sauce to \"cover up\". Service just OK--we had to keep asking for refills for water,tea,etc. Thankfully, we did not have to pay for this!! Wont be back!"}
{"text":"We're not from the area and wanted to try a non-chain place, or at least a new to us place. The food was excellent, we started off with some Loaded Pub Chips and they were delicious, we had to force ourselves to stop eating them because we were filling up on them.  I had the Beef Stew and it was amazing, it had some really great flavors. He had the Harvest Salad and loved it as well.  We were glad we tried this place out and would definitely not hesitate to return."}
{"text":"So the bar here is just fine, and the atmosphere is not bad.  If you want anything even close to traditional Irish food, go to Piper's Pub down the street.  The food here is gross, and let's be honest, bars in Ireland do NOT have Irish Car bombs.  It's actually pretty offensive if you think about it.  My metric for a good Irish pub is that when somebody orders one, the bartender grimaces and grudgingly makes one up then hands it to you with a hint of a scowl.  It's too bad that they are pretty delicious.  But yeah, seriously, this place can go eat its own ass."}
{"text":"OMG the Monte Cristo!  I'll be lucky to finish the day without having a heart attack, but it will have been worth it.  The fries were great too.  I could easily just split that with someone and be quite satisfied.  We got the duck salad too and that was also quite nice.  When it comes to deep-frying things, this place knows what they're doing.    An though it's quite a contrived \"pub\" atmosphere, I do like the ambiance here."}
{"text":"Since the wait at the Cheesecake Factory was so long, we thought we would try a new restaurant.  The server was quick and friendly.   I ordered the signature soup of corned beef and cabbage.   There were only 2 tiny pieces of corned beef and the soup was bland.    I also had the Mac and cheese which was hot and creamy.   My mother, who is on a gluten free diet was thrilled with the number of choices she had.   She ordered the Gaelic chicken and was pleased."}
{"text":"This place was conveniently located to our hotel (Marriott West). They were very accommodating to our party of 8 and did better with splitting our checks than any other restaurant I've been to in the Madison area. The Chicken Kildare was good, nothing spectacular,  but definitely not bad. I got the Bread Pudding dessert, don't be fooled by the picture this thing is HUGE! Three of us got the same dessert because we thought it would be too small, but no one was able to finish even a third it. It was pretty good too. I also tried the Pumpkin Spice martini, very tasty."}
{"text":"I was new to Pittsburgh and stumbled upon this great Irish Pub. I sat at the bar and caught a great HD Red Sox and Yankee fame and had a fantastic burger with the perfect fried egg on it. Live music was great and so was the beer"}
{"text":"Look, I had a gift certificate I needed to use. This isn't a place I'd normally come with better options readily available. I was in the neighborhood and a meal here would be free. Even still, I knew it would be a letdown just like the previous times I've been here and it was....  Like every other mammoth eatery in Legacy Village, Claddagh resides in an impressive looking building. Deep wood trim, Gaelic font on the menus and old-world European decor. Like the corny name hints at, this place is a parody of itself.   The menu is typical of other chains. I'm convinced that chain restaurants must have some kind of formula they follow on what it is they offer to the general public. The menu is so predictable and boring. A handful of starters, soups/salads, main courses and of course burgers and sandwiches. A few Irish buzz words sprinkled throughout the menu to trick the diners into thinking what it is they are eating will be authentic. Words such as \"bangers\", \"Guinness\" and \"Irish rasher\" are used throughout.   After much debate, neither one of us wanted to commit to a full meal, so we decided to split an appetizer of Spinach and Artichoke Dip (usually safe), a bowl of Guinness Onion Soup (whatever the F* that is) and a Monte Cristo Sammy. You see, we aren't one of the drones who were bamboozled and hoodwinked into resolving to succumb to a New Years diet. If I want to diet, I don't need January 1st and an overwhelming amount of media advertisements as a motivator. With that said... the non-diet food was terrible.   The spinach artichoke dip was ok, but it came with white Wonderbread-like toast to dip. Blech! The soup? I get it. \"Guinness Onion\". Haha. Oh, how creative! It's supposed to be an Irish take on French Onion, right? Well, the French must've really pissed off the Irish at some point in their history, because they butchered the hell out of this classic. The soup appeared to be topped with two slices of provolone cheese that was melted under a heat lamp. A traditional French method is to bake shredded Gruyère until it melts over the entire bowl. The mess I was given looked like it was assembled by a one armed, toothless, tongueless blind guy. The consistency of the broth was gelatinous. I had three spoonfuls before deciding it wasn't worth it. The Monte Cristo? It's a turkey sandwich with bread that was dipped in egg batter and grilled. How hard could it be? I was making sandwiches before I was potty trained. Passable, yes. Knot in your stomach hours after digestion? Yes. Will I eat it again? Nope.   Why 2 stars and not 1? I still pay taxes in Lyndhurst. If this and the other stores of Legacy Village go out of business, I'd pay even more. Oh, they also had a dessert called \"The Galway Hooker\".  That provided a few seconds of amusement.   After the meal I pondered; why is it that this city is lacking in two specific cuisines? BBQ and separately, truly authentic Irish? Those two cuisines are dominated by chains throughout NE Ohio. But true, family run soulfully authentic? I think this city could benefit with more options. Diners who think the Claddagh's and Mavis Winkles of the world are authentic could use a wake-up call."}
{"text":"Really cool Irish/old timey themed pub and decor and a great place to watch a game.  Food is A-okay.  What I tried: Loaded pub chips- This was a great appetizer to share. The chips are what American's call steak fries, but lets not split hairs. Good beer cheese sauce and lots of  toppings. Loaded is an accurate descriptor.  Shepard's Pie- Reminded me a lot of Dinty Moore's beef stew, but dressed up a little (mashed potatoes on top). Good, but not special. It's salty like the ocean, so make sure you have some water near by :)  Overall, I would recommend this place because it's really cool on the inside, but with a major caveat that the food is underwhelming.   I went with a small group on a Saturday evening (6pm), and it was not busy at all. There was even a badger football gaming going on. Not sure if this is typical, but I liked that the noise level was pretty low."}
{"text":"While the waiter was excellent - the service was poor.  Both mine and another person at my table's dinners came out freezing cold.  Not to mention, we waited an exorbitant amount of time for our food - and it was not busy at all.  They were also out of several of the beers on their menu.     The manager came out and didn't seem to be very with it.  When I said my food was cold, but the chicken was ok, he almost took my chicken off the plate and set it on the table to take the rest of the dinner to heat up.  As he was doing it he realized what a dumb move that was and stopped.  Really?  Wake up!  This is a great location and has so much potential!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly but slow considering how empty this place was and the food was bad. I had a veggie burger which didn't taste like anything while my girlfriend had the Mac n Cheese which was very disgusting. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"My husband enjoys drinking here every Tuesday night, so sometimes I join him. The $2.50 pints are an amazing deal. We've both had several drinks here plus an appetizer for under $25. The on tap beer selection is relatively good. Service at the bar is pretty fast, even when ordering a meal.  I've only eaten lunch here several times, and the service time has been descent. However, I have heard terrible stories from co-workers about how long it can take to eat, so I tend to steer clear for lunch.  Between lunch and dinner, I've ordered the Loaded Pub Chips, Goat Cheese Salad, Fish 'N Chips, and side of Mac & Cheese. The Goat Cheese Salad is delicious, and the Fish 'N Chips are very good. The Loaded Pub Chips are your average fare, and the Mac & Cheese is actually disappointingly tasteless.  I recommend going to Claddagh on Tuesday nights and for a good (but potentially long) lunch break during the week."}

{"text":"I've been here once before, and though I remember it being overpriced, it was pretty good with okay service - a typical chain/usually near a mall restaurant. Today, however, was pretty awful.  A group of six of us found ourselves at Claddagh for a trivia championship game. Service was TERRIBLE. Our waitress would take one or two people's orders at the table, then just walk away. She forgot several drinks, and seemed skeptical when one of the people at our table said he never got his. She also made no effort to go above and beyond. My friend ordered hummus & pita, but she failed to mention that if he ordered a margarita, he'd get the hummus free. Not a big deal, but the marg is a bigger sale, so it's more beneficial for her to do so.   The consensus on their burgers seemed to be \"meh,\" and the hummus and pita was gross. They fry their pita triangles, and they were soaked in grease and left the taste of stale fried nastiness in your mouth. I made it through half a pita chip before I wanted to vom.   Also, as mentioned, they're on the pricey side. With all the restaurants in Madison, you can get much more for you money elsewhere."}
{"text":"What's better than soaking in sun on a patio and downing a few glasses of Guinness?  Delicious items on the menu: onion rings, fish and chips and of course, beer!"}
{"text":"I was in charge of an event for 50 people at the Marriott West and we went to Claddagh's for one of our evening dinners. They did an excellent job with our large group - both with the pre-planning and the night of the event. They called to confirm everything beforehand. When we arrived they made sure the general manager, Michael, came over to greet me and make sure we had everything we needed. The servers, Tara and Veronica, were excellent. They were efficient, friendly, and handled the dynamics of a large group really well.   We gave our group 3 choices for dinner: 1) Mac & cheese 2) balsamic chicken and 3) fish & chips. General consensus from the group was that the balsamic chicken was excellent, the fish & chips was good, and the mac & cheese was good but very rich (a lot of cheese and bread crumb topping) We were there for their happy hour power hour and couldn't believe that some of the beers were only $1!!  We were there for a trivia night and the group had a great time. Overall, the service was excellent, the food was good, the atmosphere was fun, there was a good selection of inexpensive drinks, and I would definitely go back for a large group event. And as a result, I would also go back on my own just to try something different than the food option I had."}
{"text":"Nice place with great beer and super friendly staff"}
{"text":"If you don't like the people that you are with, avoid sitting at the patio at all costs!   During happy hour - For 2.5 hours, we were asked if we could have our drinks refilled ONCE.  We were forced to talk to each other and hang out with only 1 drink (lol).   Yes, the service is SLOW.  Now, the food:   I ordered the black & blue  steak bites. Steak was a bit tough.  No, make that A LOT tough. If the steak had been cooked a little less, I would have enjoyed this dish more.  3 of my group disliked their drinks enough that they didn't even finish them.  My drink (the Swedish Fish drink) was not bad!    Another friend was served a drink in  a broken glass. A huge piece of the glass was missing from the top. Who knows where the broken off piece had gone.   Overall, though, the patio was nice. And while I expected quicker service - especially during happy hour - it was a nice place to not feel rushed & enjoy our drink."}
{"text":"This is ABSOLUTELY the BEST Irish Pub/Restaurant around. Great ambiance, looks like an Authentic Irish Pub. Had a Great steak, perfect baked potato, and a large fresh salad. Attentive and friendly service, along with a warm cozy fire on a chilly evening.  A Wonderful way to spend St Patrick's Day."}
{"text":"The shepherds pie was great! However the portions here are so tiny. They were out of my favorite drink, which was a bummer. Service could have been faster."}
{"text":"Claddagh fall into that category of a fledgling chain restaurant that simply hovers in average-dom.  I'll give them credit...their $2.50 pints of anything on draft on Tuesdays is unbeatable. You're talking $5 for two pints Guinness or Vanilla Java Porter! Not $5 plus tax, just $5...flat! With their solid selection of draft beers, it's a hard deal to pass up for happy hour (or any time, really, since the special lasts all day!).  My problem with Claddagh has always been the food. The fish & chips are decent, and the pub fries are awesome. I think Claddagh is the only place where I can taste that the fries are frozen, but they're still good somehow (yeah...it doesn't make sense to me, either). They also used to have an excellent balsamic vinaigrette. Seriously excellent. Unfortunately, over the years, I've just given up on the food and rarely eat there anymore, despite stopping in fairly regularly on my walk home from work.  A lot of the menu items that I have found somewhat enjoyable always disappeared, thanks to the ever-changing menu. Just once, I'd love to be able to go in and see the same menu last for a year or so. To me, it's just a sign that they're not confident in their product, and the experimentation isn't helping at all, as the food has never truly improved. It's consistently average, and hardly going to leave you wanting more (aside from the pub fries, that is). I used to like the bread pudding...but they even changed that...then seemingly changed back. I never ordered it again after the first change, though.  Unfortunately, the only consistent thing about Claddagh - aside from the $2.50 draft deal on Tuesdays that's lasted a long time - is the inconsistency of both the menu, quality, and service. I'll raise a pint, though, to the hope that the small chain gets itself together, as I like the idea of having an Irish pub in the neighborhood...I just want it to be a place worth going to for food."}
{"text":"I'd really like to be able to give Claddagh a better review, but right now, I just can't.  I visited Claddagh for a Yelp event last month and had an amazing time and awesome food...but I didn't have the same experience when I came back with a  group last week.  I started off with a house salad.  The tomatoes were well past their prime.  For my meal, I got the mushroom ravioli.  I think they have the potential to be good, but what showed up on my plate was borderline crunchy.  (I like burnt food most of the time, but not in this case)    Maybe I was just there on an off night?  Most of the other people I ate with really loved their food.  I know Irish restaurants aren't known for their vegetarian grub, but...I hope to go back for some drinks and appetizers to give the place another shot."}
{"text":"ugh.   i joined some friends here for a trivia contest on a saturday. it's an \"irish\" pub. i hate \"irish\" pubs... they always attract the worst kind of people, and they're always decorated like some sort of adult, alcoholic epcot center with bad faux painting to make everything look old. claddagh definitely fits that description.  the place was packed, but even so, the service we received was DISMAL. bad, bad, bad. it took 30 minutes for our waitress to bring my beer. when i flagged her down to ask for a menu, it then took another 30 minutes for her to take our order. and then another hour for our food to arrive. there is no excuse for this kind of sub-par service.   my clam chowder was bland. the burger i got, the jameson-something-or-other, was completely slathered in jameson sauce (whatever the hell that is) and some sort of gooey cheese that resembled the nacho cheese you get at a movie theater. too. much. sauce. the burger itself had a weird meat loaf consistency. on top of being not great food, it was pricy.  i will never come back here."}
{"text":"I had been here many times before lats night for MNF but surprisingly, last night was the first time I have consumed any food here. Even though it's a chain, I was surprised  that the food we ordered-which was only a couple of appetizers-was actually not bad for bar food. The bar was pretty crowded last night but we managed to secure two seats. It was irish night so any of the Irish beers,shots,etc. were specially priced. I chose a stella (not on special) and my boyfriend had a Satin Velveteen (I think that's what it is called at least-guiness and cider mixed). We started off with the corned beef and cabbage rolls-it's like a fried reuben in a wonton. I've had these at Dive before and the ones here were better. There was a thousand island like dressing on the plate as well. I also had a cup of the french onion soup. It was nice and hot at 9pm which was surprising a little bit. Not overly cheesy or salty and had nice flavors. My boyfriend had chicken fingers-they are hard to mess up and his plate was bare at the end so I am guessing they were up to his standards. Service was decent at the bar, friendly enough and quick. We will probably return in the future for drinks or apps."}
{"text":"Mediocre, at best.  The original table was dirty.  The menu has changed and many of the better items eliminated.  The portion of salmon in the salad was a disgrace and my sandwich was just fair.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Alright, so we went on a week night when it was pretty empty--not sure if that makes a difference, but we really enjoyed ourselves!   Our food was awesome! I got the pork loin which was delicious and enormous--I had leftovers for another meal the next day. My boyfriend got the meat loaf and he liked it too. Great menu with variety but not too many items. Waitress was very friendly. The atmosphere is cool too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Onion Soup and Fish and Chips were perhaps the best I've ever had.  Perfect atmosphere, great food."}
{"text":"We had some gift cards to Claddagh, and since they don't have this chain in Chi-City, we thought we'd better use it up before we skip town.  We rolled in on a Friday night at 6 pm and were seated right away.  Some live music began around 7 pm - you can check the website, they tell you who's playing.  It can get loud, so definitely check the schedule if noise bothers you (or alternately, if you love live music and what to know what to expect).  Our server was incredibly (possibly overly attentive), checking on us approximately every 5-10 minutes during our hourlong stay.  Taking drink orders, checking on how we liked our drinks, taking food orders, seeing how we liked our food, boxing up my food, checking on my boyfriend's food progress (I eat much more slowly than him), boxing up his food, etc.  She checked in a lot.  It actually got moderately annoying, but at least she didn't ignore us!  It's a hard balance to strike.  Anyhoo, we got beer/hard cider (Strongbow on tap FTW) and then I got the chicken pot pie with a side of green beans, and my boyfriend got the shepherd's pie with a side of mac 'n' cheese.  It should be noted that they do have a \"pie night\" during the week - I forget which night - where pie dinners are buy one get one free (or maybe not free, but only for $2 or something).  One of the many times our server stopped by was exclusively to tell us about this pie night.  So it's fixed in my memory.  If you like dinner pie - that is YOUR night.  The food was pretty \"okay\" across the board.  Generic/average versions of pub favorites.  It's always a bit of a letdown because the menu items sound so DELISH and then it's like \"this food is just pretty okay.\"  The pot pie was savory and hot with big pieces of chicken and veg, but it didn't have a crust - it had like...a crumbly topping.  Like a dessert.  Only it was a bread crumb/cheese topping.  Which was not my fave - I prefer a true crust on my pot pie.  Is it really a pie without a crust?  Deep thoughts.  Side of green beans was well cooked, but of course served in butter.  Definitely not worth $3, but all restaurant sides are overpriced.    My boyfriend's shepherd's pie was okay as well - it seemed to have ground beef in it instead of big beefy chunks, but it was savory, served VERY hot, and had the appropriate mashed potato top.  Both portions were a good amount of food for the price.  The mac 'n' cheese side came in a little cup.  The texture was rockin' (sooo creamy) but it was missing something in the flava department.  Like - they need to pick better cheese, or add salt, or paprika, or onion/garlic....or anything?  It was lacking.  Ahhhhh I feel so bad giving this 2 stars but I am becoming more cruel on Yelp these days!  What can I say?  I give something three stars when it's fine and I'd be happy to pop in again if I needed a meal.  2 stars is for places where I don't really feel the need to go back again...and Claddagh really is one of them.   The food is fine for a chain, but it's really subpar versions of amazing Irish dishes that should be slammin'.  I'm so mean.  Or am I just so honest?  Hitting you up with the truth, that's how I roll.  Meet me in Chicago and we'll go to a better Irish pub.  BUT for what it's worth, my boyfriend said he'd give it three stars instead of two, AND I think it'd be a fun place to have drinks at the bar and listen to music.  And maybe have an appetizer if you're drunk.  But I'd skip it for dinner!"}
{"text":"So I went to visit my friend for the week and I flew in from Florida on my last day there we went to go have lunch at the pub before my flight. As soon as we got in we waited 10 minutes to be seated there was no one there we were the first to arrive when we sat down. it was a while before he took our orders and I'm very understanding when it comes to restaurants because I work in one but the waiters attitude was ridiculous and unpleasant. Even my friend who is way too nice was upset with our visit. As soon as we sat down he asked us for our drinks without stopping and walked away as we were telling him. Once we got our drinks he walked away and didn't even ask if were ready until another family came in. he came back to serve them and the attitude was completely different with them. After he got their drink order and food order he came back for our order there was only us and that family of 5 in the pub. When I asked which plate would be better the meat platter or cheese platter he answered saying it depends on what you like very smug like and uninterested in attempting to have a pleasant mood. Obviously the decision is based on what I liked but I was asking which one sells more. On that note I do not recommend the meat platter it's just three whole sausages sliced up that you could get from Walmart and dried up cranberries with four slice of green apple and dill pickles with spicy Dijon mustard and a nasty marinara based sauce. Another thing we found annoying is that we had no drink menue we attempted to get the servers attention 4 times before giving up that we just ate and left. We didn't even get a refill until we were ready to leave so we didn't even drink it, we also didn't even get to take our to go orders because we were extremely upset and he never asked or bothered to stay to see if we needed anything. I had to get the hostess to grab him for the check because we waited 20 minutes for it. Their food menu isn't the best either there's not really anything there besides like 5 Irish dishes and the rest burgers. I couldn't tell you what their drinks are because we didn't get the menus for that. If you do decide to go I would suggest maybe happy hour or when they have events because maybe then you might have a nice atmosphere. Also when we walked in we met one of the cooks who was nice and friendly and the lady hostess was also sweet we only saw 3 people when we walked in. We would of preferred to get the others service then that waiter. I'm a straightforward person so I understand if you just want serve and get out because I don't like associating with anyone more than I have to at my job either but at least have the common curtesy to be professional and do the job properly instead of just being straight up rude."}
{"text":"Manager invited me back with friends to show how good they normally. Great service and he picked up the tab. Food was very good."}
{"text":"Shepherd's pie about 25000 calories but sooooo good!!! Very nice staff, but no live music available that night."}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating, and the servers are great, some of them with full Irisish accents! But the food isn't anything special, but is what you would expect from a chain restaurant I suppose. I do like the decor, it has a unique feel and is very welcoming."}
{"text":"My whole family loved it. Service was great the food was delicious.   We got everything that was recommended on the menu. The Jameson burger was awesome and the scotch eggs just blew us away. I will dream about those for the rest of my life. I posted a bunch of photos.  Then the bill came. It should have cost $150 but instead it was $60. What a Great deal."}
{"text":"My family and I met up here for dinner, and it was a great experience. Our server, Becca, was very friendly and helpful. The appetizers were out quickly, and out entrees were all delicious. We had five different sandwiches, and we were all pleased with what we ordered. Some of the dishes on the menu were quite pricey, but the sandwich w/ chips plates were less expensive and great deals."}
{"text":"Fantastic evening to sit outside at Claddagh.  A slight breeze and live, accoustic music made for a delightful visit.  Seating and service were both friendly and prompt.  Drinks and our appetizer showed up faster than we thought they would.  The fried pickles are fantastic.  I am a big fan of the spear and thicker, less greasy breading.   Our entrees came out in perfect time.  Temperature was appropriate on both plates.  The beef stew is a little bland for my taste, but my wife didn't even need to look at the menu to know that she wanted it (huge fan).  I, on the other hand, took quite a while to decide on my order.  I ended up going with the Monte Cristo and am so glad that I did.  Including this one, only three Monte Cristo's stick out in my mind.  This one has made its home in the first place spot and I would be surprised if it were ever bumped out.  It might just be the best Cristo in the city.    Great job Claddagh.  We'll be back.  For sure."}
{"text":"Really spacious, kind service, and delicious bread pudding! Great Irish music playing the whole time we were there. Loads of craic!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere....until they bring out your food. I was served a chicken wrap, full of COMPLETELY half raw chicken. There excuse was that they were rushing to get food out of the cook line, meanwhile the restaurant was not busy whatsoever. Will NEVER eat here again. Possibly may return for a drink....but not likely."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a couple of appetizers.  The  corned beef and cabbage rolls were ok but did not enjoy the sauce served with them at all.  We also tried corned beef and cole slaw on a potato pancake.  These were awesome! My biggest complaint is the air conditioning.  I asked to be seated away from the fans but ended up frozen anyway.  It's August, but I should have worn a long sleeved sweatshirt.  It was hard to enjoy eating while shivering."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place, awesome food, fish sandwich is bigger than my forearm. Delicious! Irish style bar, if your a whiskey person check it out. Tuesday all day they have specials on all drafts. Outdoor seating, live music, fire outside as well."}
{"text":"Nothing to rave about except that they have a lot of out door seating. We didn't eat anything but had a few drinks on a lazy Saturday afternoon and found that it is a good spot for people watching (if you sit outside). We had to go find our waitress twice, which was annoying, but whatever, not a big deal. Pretty basic and typical."}
{"text":"Decent place but I wouldn't make it a destination choice..very convenient to movie theater and that's how I ended up there..decent beer selection..good was ok..server was the only person working the whole floor and I felt really sorry for her when a 20 top of old fanny pack wearers came in..a few people left the bar area waiting to be served. Wasn't her fault..doubt she was doing the scheduling and she was friendly."}
{"text":"Came in during a very cold and snowy night and while the place was empty due to the weather. Everyone inside was very friendly, service was great and the meal was fantastic. The place looked great and i'm looking forward to coming back. My server Dawn was very nice, had some great recommendation on the menu and did a great job."}
{"text":"Great place for Pittsburgh Penguins / Steelers for has a cool, chill vibe.  A Good hybrid place that doesn't feel like another Pittsburgh sports bar but they have a couple of projection Tvs for the game and a relaxing, socially encouraging environment.  Did that make sense?  Lol.    Also very Friendly bartenders.  $3 PBR drafts and incredible desserts comparable to the place across the street!"}
{"text":"I'm not one for negative reviews, but this place is ridiculous. I have eaten there before with mixed feelings, but our meals there yesterday were simply unacceptable. First off this place is slow. VERY SLOW. Our table of 4 was seated promptly and the server was nice, but she too was slow. The restaurant was fairly empty for 5pm on a Sunday, yet it still took 35 minutes for our one order appetizer of soft pretzels to come out. Dinner was another 30 minutes. Not one of us like our meal and we are not food snobs. The girls only ate a few bites and decided to pass when the server asked if we needed a box. I only ate half of mine as well.   We ended up here because the wait at the place next door was over an hour. With the awful food and the slow service, we should have stuck it out like the rest of the people next door decided to do. If it's not St. Patty's day, I would skip this place."}
{"text":"I think I've found my new (er, only?) hangout spot in Southside Works. I had avoided this place for a long time because plenty of people told me the food was bad. Well, they're wrong. At least about the chicken tenders.  I have been to Claddagh twice now and still can't pronounce the name correctly (mispronouncing words is my thing). That doesn't matter since I can still get to the place whenever I feel a want to. The first time I visited was before a movie so we didn't stay long and the second was to celebrate one week straight of exercising. By drinking lots of beer. Also, Irish car bombs.  Both times I have ordered the chicken tenders app to split with my boyfriend. This is going to sound so ridiculous, but they are hands down the best chicken tenders I have ever had. I know - chicken tenders? Um, ok. No, seriously. Go order some from Claddagh. I'll wait. They are amazing. I don't know what they do to the breading, but it is finger-licking delicious!  Their beer selection on tap is pretty awesome as well. They have Killian's! Probably my favorite beer from college and still pretty high on my list. TV set up is great if you're sitting at the bar. Which I always am.  Service: stellar. The bartenders are funny, prompt, and delightful. I have no qualms about recommending this place."}
{"text":"They had what sounded like a good special for Valentine Day turned out to be a joke.  Food was of poor quality, and way over priced.  Food in the past was good here.  The place was always busy.  Recent visits not so.  Disappointing.  Cool place for at least drinks, now I dont even consider it as an option."}
{"text":"I gotta give this place an A-Ok rating because it's...A-OK! Once you are at the bar itself and have had a few pints, it gets better. Stick to the bar area and it's A-OK. Across the street is the Hofbrau house. That's A-OK, too, but this review is about the Claddagh, so let's not get distracted. On the other hand, just outside the Claddagh is Cheese Cake Factory. That's A-OK, too. So in a nutshell, I am A-OK with the Claddagh. The most significant or most positive thing to say about the Claddagh is that they can certainly pour a proper pint of Guinness. Isn't that what it's all about? Cheers!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy The Claddagh when I visit. I was there today and the lunch was a decent portion at a good price. The service was also friendly and fast. It is not the sort of place I go out of my way to go to anymore. I use to go very often but we had bad service one time too many. Today was a good surprise. It may be time to give them another shot."}
{"text":"Having a great time with a live band playing walking Rosie. Good Irish eggs, wings and beer.  Yeah stick with beer.  My wife's martin was pretty bad even with second try.  Otherwise having a good time and I can easily over look martinis made bad at an Irish bar because the Irish whiskey flight was just right"}
{"text":"We wanted to grab a bite before walking along the Mon river, and also wanted to try a whiskey instead of beer so we wound up at Claddaghs.  The décor inside is fantastic.  It alone is worth coming here.  The Irish music playing also added greatly as did the driver's caps the male wait staff were wearing.  (The only detraction were the Steelers jerseys some waitstaff were wearing.  I know it's game day, and I'm a fan too, but what a clash.)  I got a Jameson and my companion got a moscow mule (two, actually) and they were great and mellowed us right out.  So nice   The only disappointment was with the Monte Cristo.  I've had this before numerous times in Southern California and was really looking forward to it. I was expecting a ham & turkey sandwich pan fried the way you prepare French toast.  Not so here.  This thing was deep fried.  It felt and tasted like I was eating a donut.  Not good, and I probably absorbed a lot of oil.   So I give them a four because it's a great place - just don't get the Monte Cristo - unless of course you like donuts for lunch!"}
{"text":"An Irish themed sports bar and restaurant that has good food and beer selection. The fish and chips or steakburgers are great and the staff are very friendly.  Outdoor tables for when the weather is good."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this review is going to be the first of many where I have discovered that listening to \"Yelpers\" is sometimes not the best way to find a restaurant in a strange city. I don't know if people on Yelp have lost their discerning palates or if I have become just really picky, but this restaurant / bar is a perfect example of so much going wrong. First, I didn't realize that this was a chain. The same one exists in Deerfield Commons in Mason, Ohio. Where did I go wrong? I read a review of fish and chips and I ordered them. OMG! The fish was so slimy, the batter just slid right off. That didn't help the situation, as the fish was not truly white, more of a grey colored substitute. The chips were not crispy, just fried in a lot of oil. I am sure there are other places in Madison to go for a beer and something to eat. I would advise finding them. This is not a destination one shoul choose."}
{"text":"I haven't had a real problem with this place so far. I see reviews about the service being terrible, but I haven't had such a terrible experience so far. It's probably because I do not go late on the weekends. For the money I spent there I would much rather go somewhere with outstanding food and drinks. It's just an okay place really."}
{"text":"This place is gross, really just smoke and mirrors. They make you think the food is going to be good because of the ambiance. Food is disgusting. Bartender is slow and rude, way over priced and the bathrooms are gross!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a Monday with my mom while visiting Cleveland. It was bitter cold in January but the fish and chips for lunch were great! Hot and fresh and the service was pretty fast too. The chips had some kind of ranch dressing on them. The server told us that the fish was cod, which I expected. My mom LOVED the small portion of bread pudding. Also,  fabulous on a cold winter's day."}
{"text":"I am going to start by saying that our server, Natalie, was great. She was gracious, apologetic, and did comp my inedible entree. Natalie was the only thing good about this place. We ordered the cheese board, which was disappointing, of I'm being kind. It was to contain 4 cheeses. What it did contain was some blue cheese and 2 tiny scoops of what can best be described as cheese like food spread like one would find in a plastic tub in a Hickory Farms sampler. There was no sun-dried tomato spread. The baguette slices were dry and stale. It wasn't worth $2 let alone $15. The beef stew was atrocious. I have no idea how they managed to serve roast beef that was dry when it was swimming in burgundy sauce, but they did. I think the mashed potatoes were instant. And I don't know what those 2 dry points of bread really were, but they certainly weren't the Irish soda bread that they claimed it to be. If I could give this place zero stars, I would. We will never go back. And if you see this Natalie, you are better than this place. I hope you can find work somewhere else where you can serve real food and make a good living."}
{"text":"The place had wonderful jameson burger I am trying to find out where had they moved. By reading reviews I think the place should have called 'The Profit' before they closed because apart from service everything was fantastic"}
{"text":"Horrible service, girl bartender ignored us , we waited 10 minutes at bar for a drink and nothing, 8-13-17. We ended up leaving and taking our business elsewhere.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"I love this place, but I don't seem to get there often enough.  I love me some corned beef, and they do it well!  When you see that cole slaw comes ON the sandwich, try it!  I was hesitant the first time and ordered it on the side (promising to try a few bites on the sandwich).  Oh wow!  I'd love to try other things on the menu, but I hate to deviate from a winner!  Great food, excellent beer, and super service.  Worth a stop once in a while.  I can't afford to eat at places like this all the time, but it's a helluva treat when I feel I deserve it! :)  While I don't do fish, my folks love their fish fry..."}
{"text":"Claddagh is such a great place for drinks on a weeknight! There are not many people there and you almost feel as though you have the place to yourself! The staff has never been very helpful, but it hasn't deterred me from going back. The food that I ate was not amazing, but I would be open to trying different menu items! The inside is spacious, dimly lit, and comfortable to just unwind and relax in. The patio area lines the restaurant in an L shape and is complete with a fire to keep warm! I really enjoy it outside and find it just as relaxing and spacious as the inside!"}
{"text":"Ate here with some friends on a Saturday night- great waitress! Food was good too. We had a deal offered here from Yelp and the manager wasn't aware of it but he accepted it anyway. Good all around."}
{"text":"It's a pub, but it's faux-Irish.  They had English vinegar on the tables, Jameson sitting next to Bushmills, and turned off the rugby game to watch a hockey interview show.  The fish and chips had half the fish being awful chewy, the beef stew was authentic enough to be incredibly bland, and the darker beers we ordered tasted awful watery.  If you want strip-mall-irish, it might be the best Pittsburgh has to offer; we're thin on chains around here.  Fado does it better, if you've been to one of those.    Try Mullaney's in the Strip if you want more authentic Irish.  Hell, go down to Piper's British Pub and try the boxty."}
{"text":"Nice selection of beer, whiskies and cocktails. Specials are well thought-out (ie PB & J). Great, authentic service. Cool seating nooks. Clean bathrooms. Right across the street from Hyatt House and River walk."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Claddagh for the first time after years of driving past the place.  A co-worker and I were in the mood for fish n chips on a fine Friday.  When we arrived I remarked that Claddaugh looked like a store on the outside.  When we walked in the decor was dark and I liked it.  The place was large and there were plenty of open seats...too many actually.  There were very few people in the place, but I expected it to be full.    We were immediately seated near a warm fireplace.  Within a minute a server was taking our drink orders.  We reviewed the menu and I saw a fish sandwich for $9.99.  Pricey, I thought, so I looked for the fish n chips.  The fish n chips were $14.99!  That's the most expensive fish n chips I've ever heard of.  Still, we both ordered the dish.  Within 7 minutes, I our food arrived.    There was a huge chunk of battered, deep fried fish before us.  The fries were plump and golden cooked.  There was a side of coleslaw included as well.  It all looked delicious!  The fish was piping hot so I let it cool for a moment while I tasted the fries.  They were deliciously seasoned and cooked right.  The fish was delicious too.  It was white, flaky, and very tasty.  It fell apart just as I would expect.  The fish batter was also delicious.  It was crunchy on the outside and had a good flavor.  I ate every bit of the fish, but I couldn't finish my fries.  It was a large portion.  The fish was very satisfying.  With drink, my tab came to $18.99.  With tip, my lunch was $21...double what I normally pay.  I'll keep this place in mind, but not for lunch."}
{"text":"The parentals and I went to this irish pub for a quick lunch on Sunday.  We walked in at noon- the restaurant was completely empty. Minus one person sitting at the bar, the entire restaurant, yes, entire, was empty. I mean, I guess that's expected. An irish pub that's advertising their Morgan cider? It's popular a lot more busier at night.  Anyways, we chose our table and sat down. I was quite surprised at how nice and friendly the waitress was. She was very good logistically- went through the menu, got the food going, etc etc, got us the dessert menu when she picked up our last plate, brought out the water pitcher before our glasses went empty..and just overally friendly and knowledgeable. I don't remember her name, but kudos to her.   The portions are HUGE here. Yes, HUGE. My dad ordered the patty mac- corned beef and cole slaw. Mmm. It was pretty good. I split the chicken spinach melt with my mom- it was okay. I mean, I wasn't too impressed with it, but it was okay. And those pub fries....man, does anyone ever finish their plate? It's definitely good....pub food.  As always, I couldn't deny my sweet tooth, and ordered the sherry trifle at the end- whipped cream, sherry & berry coulis, and pound cake. It came out really cute- all layered in a small cocktail glass- and only 2 bucks (their special for the month of Nov)! The berries were def frozen...and I couldn't find the pound cake amidst all the whipped cream....but it was okay?  Of course, this place, like other places in Beachwood, is a chain. So not super unique....but it's an okay place to just grab a bite to eat and drink. I'll have to try it again at night...."}
{"text":"The truely worst thing here is a bit of slow service. Servers are hit or miss, but the kitchens have consistently been sluggish. However, the portion size, taste, and heartiness of the food is worth the wait. The best part of the PUB is when you go for the PUB part tho. The bar tenders and manager are sooooo nice and the live music and drink specials keep me coming back regularly."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with my girlfriend. At 1:00 in the afternoon there was barely anyone there. Casual atmosphere and good service while we were there. We split Irish egg rolls, Irish beef stew and fish and chips. The lunch portions were more than enough. Food was good. We enjoyed it and would come back if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The IRA should firebomb this place. Claddagh has done more to disgrace the Irish than those Brits ever did. (Although, on second thought, it's probably less disgraceful than the work of Michael Flatley. So, nevermind...get that prancing idiot first. Let thy Legacy Villagers keep thy bogus pub!) Is this a chain? It feels awfully chain-like. Right down to the identical unfunny sloganed T-shirts worn by the entire staff...some tired old joke about alcoholism. (I don't care how funny a phrase might be...the very moment you print it on a T-shirt, it ceases to be funny.) Did I unwittingly walk into a chain? Damn it....I think I did. My first instinct was to bolt for the door, but I decided to suffer through a round of drinks and appetizers first. It's like TGI Fridays with an \"Irish Theme\". The food was pretty bad, and the music was worse (nothing says pub atmosphere like.....Madonna?) I was sitting there.....hoping desperately that some Arsenal football hooligans would show up and start headbutting people and spit blood and teeth everywhere, just to lend some element of authenticity to my experience....but alas, no such luck. Just perky servers with standard-issue smiles serving recently-unfrozen food to happy, mildly-intoxicated Americans. No hooligans detected. They have no idea how to pour beer here, either. My black & tan was an abomination. (How does one combine Guinness and Bass and produce something that tastes like Budweiser? There's some weird reverse-alchemy happening behind that bar. )   In fairness, I stopped in here because I had a vision and thirst for a rich, creamy ale in a gloomy pub on the Emerald Isle. What I got instead was a reminder of cheap, franchised America. Claddagh has the right \"look\" inside...all the right details are there in the decor...but the food, beer, and music made it impossible to project myself anywhere besides where I actually was: a mall parking lot, next to the Cheesecake Factory.   A PERSONAL NOTE: An old Irish-Am. girlfriend used to torment me with one of those Claddagh rings, with the two hands and the heart and whatever symbolic, sentimental garbage was associated with it. She'd talk about committment, and I'd stare off into space like some post-Hollywood Joaquin Phoenix, praying for deliverance from the whole uncomfortable topic. Are you trying to infuse our relationship with meaning and romance via some $9.99 piece of crap jewelry? Yeah. Nice try. Ask me about my new rap album."}
{"text":"Went there for a family reunion of sorts, watched the notre dame game , listened to a great band. Had wonderful service thanks to shelley, great drinks, food and loved the jameson cheezecake, we will be back next time we visit madison"}
{"text":"Good service, authentic appetizers and great beer selection. Definitely worth stopping in for at least a pint."}
{"text":"Service is slow, even when it's not crowded. Food is bland. I've been here a few times, and I always leave wondering how I spent so much money with such little satisfaction."}
{"text":"Typical generic Irish Pub and in the middle of a psuedo suburban downtown/city center development.  It is right next to a cheeseburger in paradise so it can only be as good as expected.    They have the typical fare: fish and chips, shepards pie, bangers and also with plenty of Guinness on tap.  I had a few black and tans and the rest of my work group had a great time :)  The staff was awesome and the only thing I'd of wish we had was some tvs in our private room - hard to watch the Tigers game when you have to squint 30 yds to the bar tv.  Good for groups if ever entertaining corporate types in Middleton WI.  Oh and FYI - NO SPOTTED COW!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a salad and soup...the salad was bland and not very good at all ( I don't remember what kand of salad it was...that's how uninspiring it was). However the clam chowder was some of the best I've ever had, if not the very best!!! Decent atmosphere and the service was good."}
{"text":"This place gets a solid 3 stars.  Walkable from our hotel and wanting something with a more local hangout type of vibe, the hotel front desk recommended this place.  Our group shared food, and the fish & chips was definitely the strongest dish.  I'm already in trouble with my cholesterol, however, so I had the balsamic chicken but it was just average.  Some people had the same comment about their shepherd's pie and left nearly half of it uneaten.  I guess the takeaway is go with the house specialties and don't deviate too far from them.  I mean, asking an Irish place to make balsamic chicken is like asking me (Chinese) to make you an authentic carne asada burrito.  That's a Yelp no-no.  Travis took excellent care of us, though.  He checked on us frequently, refilled drinks, cleared the empty soup bowls and salad plates promptly, and was very understanding about our need for separate checks.  Lesson learned: next time, corned beef & cabbage!  We'll be back for 1 more trip."}
{"text":"Part of the chain gang.    Never an amazing experience.  Usually always lots o' fried stuff.  Best part of the place?  You guessed it kids...the patio!    This place is usually the go to spot for a couple friends of mine, so how am I to argue?  If there's a Happy Hour special, I'm there!  $4.00 20 oz beers in tap?  Oh, you have Yeungling?  Let's get this party started!   I've had a plethora of the fried offerings.  One being a corn beef and cabbage roll.  It's like a fried Reuben sammie.  Throw some thousand island dressing on the side and I'm in!  I also tried the baked mac n' cheese.  It's ok.  Not really baked as much as just thrown together with garlic and bread crumbs dumped on the top.  If you would have been a little cheesier mac n' cheese I would have liked you MUCH better!  One of the special menu items I noticed tonight?  A Claddaugh ring that can be ALL yours for the small price of $19.99.  Enterprising?  Not so much.  Cheesy?  Most definitely!  Too bad the Mac n' cheese wasn't!"}
{"text":"I went there during restaurant week.. I got their brochette - it was amazing! I also got the Shepard's pie, which was also delicious... But I ordered a pecan pie for dessert... it was more of a chocolate pie! It was a cookie crust, with chocolate chips, and Hersey soup basically!! With maybe 3 pieces of chopped pecans! SOO DISAPPOINTING."}
{"text":"This place is one of the worst places I've eaten in Pittsburgh. I ordered the fish tacos and they came out with rotten guacamole on top and fried fish (the menu doesn't specify the fish is fried and I've never had fried fish tacos so my bad for not asking if the fish was fresher).  They also took a really long time to bring out our food (we were basically the only ones in the place) and they messed up my order (they gave me their French fries even though my fish tacos comes with kettle chips).  My friend's father ordered a side of coleslaw and it came out practically frozen and not edible.  Pittsburgh has a lot of amazing food places, so don't waste your money here!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the casual pub. Nice ambiance. Good noise level. Had the Irish Stew and Shepard's Pie which were good. The Jameson hamburger with the whiskey sauce, beer cheese and fried onion straws, was excellent.  Attentive service.  Will visit this pub again."}
{"text":"Visited with a large group on a Friday night and was surprised at how quickly we were seated and served.   Great server and decent pub food.  Our group enjoyed a variety of appetizers (fried pickles, pub chips, corned beef & cabbage rolls) and dishes from salads to fish specials (Friday during lent) and Irish favorites; bangars and mash, fish and chips, Irish breakfast...  I had the Baked Mac n' Cheese with Shrimp. The shrimp were fantastic and the mac n cheese was good, but had too much breading on top for my taste.  Portion size was good, quality was good and prices are fair."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how much I like the food, but the venue is pretty fun and there is some nice outdoor seating with heat lamps and a fireplace. They have $4 drafts for happy hour during the week, which is nice. I ordered the Goat Cheese Salad with a side of Mac n' Cheese. I did not like the macaroni by my was quite good. All in all, it is a nice place in a convenient location, and the service is good."}
{"text":"I typically try not to review chains, but we had such a silly experience here on Sunday.  We stopped by prior to seeing a movie.  I'm sure most of their business is due to the convenience of the location.  I've probably been here a dozen times and it's what you'd expect from a chain \"faux\" Irish pub.  The restaurant itself is actually quite attractive.  There are high ceilings, plenty of seating (tables, hi-tops and booths) and a good looking dark wood bar with plenty of brass scattered about.  The food is again what you'd expect...think whatever TG McFunsters comes to mind and then add a cabbage dish or too.  So, why the reason for me to review this chain?  We grab a seat at the bar and are greeted by a very nice young bartender.  I think her name is McKenzie.  I order a Guinness, since the place literally is like one big commercial for this storied brew.  I mean literally there is no where you can look including the ceiling without seeing some type of Guinness paraphernalia.  She sheepishly tells me they are out of Guinness.  It's clear she's embarrassed, however as shocking as this is I most likely wouldn't have taken the time to document this if for just that problem.  They are also out of Bass and Harp??  Okay, fine let's just order something to eat.  I get the fish sandwich (which was pretty good actually, especially the fries). Annie orders the \"loaded\" fries, but with only cheese and bacon on it.  She specifically asks for no tomatoes.  The first order comes up and McKenzie notices the tomatoes and doesn't even bring it to us.  Then they make the same mistake again and put tomatoes on the darn thing, this time McKenzie brings it over and basically says they can't seem to do this difficult task, so we skip the fries.  Finally, we are about to leave and I'm paying the bill when I notice they put someone else's' drinks' on my tab.  Okay, let's recap.  Irish pub out of Guinness, harp and bass.  They mess up a food order not once, but twice.  Finally, they overcharge me for someone else's drinks.  I still tipped the bartender 20%+, because clearly she was embarrassed and most of these mistakes were not her fault.  However, I think this place must be severely mismanaged.  Almost every experience that the back of the house was in charge of was poorly executed.  Hopefully, they'll get their act together."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal!!  I loved every bite through and through.  They had a wide selection of authentic Irish cuisine which complimented well with the atmosphere.  Every time I go in there however, they are super slow which usually I don't mind, but when I'm out with my girlfriend, it doesn't make for a memorable time.  More folks need to check this place out!  I know I will again in the future."}
{"text":"A great eating establishment.  I read some of the Yelp reviews before stopping in here with friends and found that I was pleasantly surprised that they exceeded some of the reviews.  It seems that there are many VERY hard to please people in the world  First, the food was excellent.  I had the Mac and Cheese Shepherds Pie and it was both tasty and filling!  We were there on 2.50 beer night and that was excellent too.  My friends both had different dishes and each reported that theirs was great.  Second, the waiter was friendly and super helpful!  He answered all our questions and was, as he put it, \"brutally honest\" when it came to helping pick out an entre!  He kept us filled up and was always close by when we needed anything.  Third, the restuarant itself was very nice.  The whole \"Irish pub\" motif can be either over done or just not well done, not so here!  Even the music was very much Irish and I thought it was just right.    I was surprised at how empty the pub was on 2.50 pint night!  If you live in the area or are staying in the area, you should stop by here, on a Tuesday and enjoy yourself and the Shepherd's Pie!"}
{"text":"First thing to be said is that the decor of the restaurant is great. They have a few different rooms that all have a different theme and look amazing. We have tried to dine here on a few visits to the south side but they are always packed so we we chose a Monday after a Steelers game for lunch. On to the food, the scotch eggs were on point and the mustard was good. We also ordered the corned beef and cabbage rolls which were delicious and we both devoured. She had the shepherds pie and said it was above average. I went all in with the Irish breakfast and a Guinness. We both loved the soda bread which is sweet and filling. The eggs I ordered (over easy) were spot on, the ham was good along with bangers. The mushrooms were simply amazing. I've never had white or black pudding (which as an Irish American is almost blasphemy) but always wanted to try it and found that I love it. The bartender who waited on us (we were the only table) was professional and really knew his beer and liquor. The only bad thing I can say is that they are missing a ceiling tile in the main area. Can't wait till we stay in the south works again and this time I'll wait to be seated."}
{"text":"My friends brought me here on St. Patrick's Day. We had a really good time. The staff and customers were definitely in the spirit of their holiday!  We started off with a humungous Irish beer (I suppose it would be helpful if I remembered the brand name of the delicious beer but I don't recall) and for lunch I was tempted to try the highly recommended Fish and Chips--they looked good--but I did not. I tried:   chicken spinach melt--chicken breast with spinach & artichoke dip on toasted sourdough; served with pub chips. 8.99  I REALLY liked this sandwich. It really hit the spot! It was a regular chicken breast sandwich with the spinach and artichoke dip you would get as an appetizer spread on the bread. I thought it was a really unique combination for a sandwich and it was really good. The pub chips are thick cut fries--my favorite.   I would highly recommend Claddagh Irish Pub and I would HIGHLY recommend the sandwich i ate....  Oh, there was an Irish rock band playing with a female vocalist that played the violin. The band was out of this world. I really enjoyed them!"}
{"text":"Claddagh made me think of Dubliner, McFaddens, and Raglan Road as the stereotype of what an Irish pub should be...loud and dark. I swear if I ever went into a supposed Irish pub that I could see my menu I would faint. The food was standard fair. Spinach artichoke dip a bit gloppy, not easy to eat with dry Melba toast. The cabbage egg roles were an strangely tasty fusion dish. I did order the fish and chips, but something about the breading was tough and uninviting. And cod is a plain fish to start. The desserts were the crushing element of the dinner. The chocolate pecan pie was too much chocolate. And the bread pudding was dry and nothing like bread pudding should be made. Overall, the food was typical Irish chain food."}
{"text":"I typically make my dining decisions based on Yelp, and the low number of stars almost scared me away, but we had a coupon from the Bucky Book, so we decided to try this place.  Honestly, this place is underrated on Yelp.  Some of the reviews are pretty old, so maybe the restaurant stepped up their game?  The atmosphere/decor is really cool.  The service was fine.  They had a huge projector screen and TVs everywhere, so we could watch the game.  I went with a group of five, and everyone enjoyed their food.  The specialty cocktails were also very good.  Our group said they would give Claddagh 5 stars; however, my husband and I are kind of food snobs, and we both agreed that is was more of a 3.75, so I opted for 4 stars."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place has gone downhill over the years. We've been here a number of times and get less and less satisfied each time. We ordered the fish and chips and black n tans this time. The beer had a metallic taste. We could taste that the oil used to cook our meals was very old. It's too bad. This once used to be a destination restaurant for us."}
{"text":"I came here a while ago to watch a sporting event. The food was pretty good, and the service was good as well. It did a bit crowded once the event started, but that is pretty expected, especially considering the area that it is in."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Claddagh Irish Pub.  I was here the first time in 2010  for a work lunch, but I rarely go to the South Side Works, so I didn't consider this a destination location, but my brother wanted to eat here, so we met him for a late lunch on a Saturday.    It was relatively quiet when we got there, but this was a snowy weekend, so not many people were out and about.  We sat in the side and it was bright and sunny and the paintings of the two snakes on the ceiling and the other Celtic symbols painted on the walls, along with the eclectic knicknacks and books made the decor interesting and the atmosphere fun. It was a really great place to relax on a snowy Saturday afternoon and they had some drink specials on bloody marys and beer, so we enjoyed a few drinks along with our meal.  At our server's suggestion, we ordered the Guinness Beer Cheese & Pretzels as an appetizer, which were good, and my brother suggested that we share an order of the Scotch Eggs which were absolutely delicious!  I've never had them, but wow they were warm and crusty on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside!  We really enjoyed them.  Our server was really friendly and went out of his way to take good care of us.  For an entree, my boyfriend and I each ordered a different burger and split them - we got the Claddagh Burger which had fried egg, bacon and cheddar cheese and the Jameson Burger which had a Jameson Whiskey glaze, Guinness Beer cheese, and onion straws.  They were both juicy and delicious and so big that we were actually able to take some home even though we shared them.  My brother got the Shepherd's Pie and said that it was delicious as well.  The food was good, and I would definitely go back again to try some of their other signature menu items.  I was also really pleased by how much I enjoyed the atmosphere because when I was there the first time I remembered being in a very dark room with our work group and that was part of why I haven't been back because it just seemed \"gloomy\" at the time.  I was really happy with ourexperience and look forward to going to Claddagh again."}
{"text":"Awful food and bad service. Only went here because Hofbrau and Cheesecake were slammed. Food undercooked, wrong drinks, no silverware or napkins. We felt bad for our waitress because it was only her third day but overall not a good experience."}
{"text":"Update: popped in for the rugby, World Cup 2015 coverage that is, and currently the TV signal is out with what looks like 0 hustle from the staff to get it sorted for the past 20 minutes. Not good Claddah!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to like Claddagh since it opened. The inside is so quaint!   Unfortunately, that's where it ends. Today though, the bad service and bad food really was the last straw. We were on the East Side to take the dog to the groomer. Don't judge... she is rather high maintenance and it's the only place I know can *really* groom a scottie dog.   Moving on... The boy and I were wandering aimlessly trying to kill a few hours waiting for the dog, and decided to get lunch. As we were driving past Claddagh, he said \"I've never tried Claddagh\". I kind of shifted uncomfortably... having previously lived on the East Side, and given the place a shot a couple times, I knew that the only thing they were good for was a drink... maybe a fried appetizer.   We were seated at 12:30. Knowing we had about 1.5 hours before we had to pick up said Scottish Terrier, we decided on some simple dishes: I ordered the caesar salad and french onion soup. The boy ordered the Irish Stew (it IS an Irish Pub, afterall...).   SO... we waited. And waited..... and waited some more. If you will notice, these are both dishes that would have been made that morning. Neither of these were being made upon order. Our waitress stopped by - only once - to say that she put the order in and she didn't know what was going on.   Finally, an hour later our food came out: COLD. Wth.   We spoke with the manager, who was a very sweet, apologetic man. I could tell that he was very disappointed in the service we received. He didn't charge us for lunch... and gave us a $30 gift card to try again. He tried to make it right. It was just sooo wrong.   We left hungry though..."}
{"text":"I'm like the only native-born Clevelander who's not Irish, so whether or not this place is authentic or not is sort of a non-issue for me because I have nothing to which I can compare the Claddagh.   I will say, though, that even if this place is the Disneyland of Irish pubs, it still serves up a mean corned beef sandwich and pours a great glass of Irish beer. I've never been disappointed with anything I've ever had here, though, but I usually try to stick to the Irish selections on the menu. Portion sizes are pretty nice too...I usually leave with leftovers.  One of my personal favorite dishes are the Irish Spring Rolls...they're like Chinese spring rolls but with corned beef and cabbage inside the spring roll wrapper, and they provide dipping sauce on the side too. Give 'em a try--they're quite good! I'd stay away from the Brie, though, if you're looking for appetizers.  I read that the Claddagh at Crocker Park closed, making this the only one in the Cleveland area. However, the same article had a quote from Claddagh's upper level management saying that this location is one of their best performing stores...so I guess they're doing something right here!"}
{"text":"It's IRISH!!! You can't go IRISH and not do Carbombs and Guiness!!!  Haha, I chose not to partake in the Guiness--traded that in for a Blue Moon sans the Orange. I did, however, throw back a few (READ : 4) carbombs.  YUMMY--Jameson you are my vice.  Anyways, I didn't just go here to drink--I went here because I couldn't get a ticket into Melts down the street...    Iwas totally looking forward to hammer down on some steak since I wasn't going to be grubbin' on any Grilled Cheeses.  I ordered the Steak & Fries... the steaks were advertised to be topped w/ onion rings so I was suckered in--who doesn't love Onion RINGS, eh?!  Anyways... the onion rings were great... but the steak was CRAP... ughhh so dry... seriousy--I made better steak by the time I was 5 years old.    Luckily the onion rings were as good as they were because the steak was super-duper yuck and the fries were forgettable.  I did get a chance to order a side of MAC & CHEESE with this thing called RASHERS--I guess it's like bacon or something... but BETTER!! You hear that California... like bacon, BUT BETTER!!!!!!!  It definitely was good... the Rashers were extremely savory and the cut was crispy and tender... lovely.  What wasn't lovely was 3 spoonfulls ran a cool, $7.50... picture this as a small side from KFC for a scope comparison.  Service was definitely acceptable... our server took care of the 11 of us valiantly and although she was late on a few beers and forgot a few others, we understood--I mean, 11 people w/o reservations--pretty damn good job.  Ambiance is fair, nothing memorable... but nothing trashy either.  THAT STEAK THOUGH... BEWARE, it dragged everything downhill... and it wasn't like a budget joint either you know? My meal had a face value of approximately 65 dollars--I was very fortunate to have had my bud Cody around to pay for 3 out of the 4 carbombs... I would've expected a better quality cut for the money they made that night."}

{"text":"I recently won a Facebook contest that won me a Appetizer Buffet for 25 of my friends and I have to say that it was a lot of fun. The Food was delicious and everyone eat and drank their hearts out.   The buffet consisted of many of their delicious Appetizers, including the loaded Pub chips, Corned Beef & Cabbage Rolls, Pierogies,Yuengling Battered Shrimp , Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Chicken Wings, a sandwiches plate and cheese plate. There was so much food we had it coming out of our ears.  It was a great time and everyone really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Went in around 5:30pm and it was not busy. It was confusion at first on where to seat us. The place was empty. It took 3 people to try to make a decision. After telling two people I didn't want to sit outside they asked me again! No, I don't want to sit outside. Finally, the hostess tried to sit us(2)on a table for two crammed up against the wall. I voiced my displeasure and she put us at a table for 4. The music coming over the speakers was loud. I ordered the Sheperds pie. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"As a rule I don't go to an Irish Pub for the food. I expect a good bar with friendly folk and some good music. On these points Claddagh's is alright. They were very obviously short-staffed but I had a cold, local beer and a decent burger in my hands within 25 minutes or so.   Jason was bar tending solo on a Monday night and he was stretched thin but was really nice and attentive. He gave me a quick education on some local microbrews and got my food order in pretty well.   Overall this is a decent stop if you're looking for some music, beer and bar food in the area."}
