{"text":"We stopped in here for a light lunch but ended up with three courses.  The appetizer and entree were so good we decided we had to try the dessert!  The servings were quite large and good enough to share, so the price was actually quite reasonable even though this is a fine dining restaurant.

The appetizer was just an egg plant spread served with naan but the spread itself has some delicate flavours and no mere spread.  The chicken entree was soft and tender, served with israeli couscous and beluga lentils, with nicely contrasting textures.  The chick peas salad that came with it was quite complex - a refreshing mix of chick peas, peppers, onions and radishes.  

But the crowning glory was the warm Egyptian coconut pudding - Um Ali.  It was the best ever bread pudding we've tasted - soft and moist but crunchy on top, perfectly complemented by the cinnamon ice cream and mint leaves.

This is a gem within a gem.  For more photos and details, please visit my blog at foodsparks.blogspot.ca"}
{"text":"What should have been a lovely lunch with friends was seriously tainted when we EACH had to pay $10 flat rate parking fee for a 1.5 hour lunch.  We did not tour the Aga Khan museum.  We only met there for lunch to try a new restaurant experience during Winterlicious.  

Had we known there was such an additional fee then we might have carpooled or made other lunch plans.  But there was no indication that there would be this additional fee, not even when they personally called me the day before to confirm my reservation.

Who would expect to pay $10 for parking in the middle of nowhere (DVP and Wynford Drive with nothing else in walking distance)?  I asked the restaurant if they validate or subsidize the parking for their guests.  They do NOT.  Whereas many restaurants do offer that.

Food was good.  Service was upscale.  Ambience is elegant. But I'd only recommend the restaurant if you happen to also be touring the museum.  Otherwise, there are other great restaurants just up the street at the Shops on Don Mills where the parking is free (including another one of Mark McEwen's restaurants Fabbrica)."}
{"text":"We went to try Diwan for their Winterlicious Lunch deal. Set in a beautiful location, the food is great, well presentable and absolutely delicious! I had ordered Onion bhaji from starters, Chicken Jalfrezi from the mains and Orange Semolina Pudding for Dessert. One of my friends ordered Lentil Soup instead and that even looked very filling! For $28 Winterlicious Lunch deal, it is on a pricey side but you get what you pay for! Good ambiance and great food ! Its a must go - infact, I am planning to drive again during summer just to enjoy the food in their outdoor setup!"}
{"text":"Had the delicious Ali Nazik for appetizer and I wouldn't mind one bit if they gave me a bigger portion of the same for the main! They also had special drink options for $6.50 that aren't on the menu. i tried the one with Cactus Pear (which I heard as cactus, pear, instead of realising it was one ingredient ) and had to stop myself from devouring it immediately. The food here is halal which is a big plus for me and the only reason this gets a 4 star is because the chicken biriyani main I had was uninteresting.

It's a good idea to reserve ahead of time as they're only open between 11.30-2.30 6 days of the week"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my parents' birthdays and it was a great experience. The service was impeccable from start to finish and even though our reservation was for 2pm, at the tail end of their lunch service, we never felt rushed. 

The highlights for me were the lamb meatballs, the sumac fries, the chicken jalfrezi and the salmon. Although, all the dishes were perfectly and distinctly seasoned. I find that restaurants serving middle eastern/south Asian cuisine often over-cook their meats, but that was not the case here. The whole menu here is an elevated version of dishes I've experienced before, but with better ingredients and more finesse. 

The dessert that stood out was the carrot cake and we also ordered the turkish/Moroccan coffee, which were good. 

Great ambience, service, and food."}
{"text":"It's decent.

Went for lunch.  The Berber steak and the tandoori fries were stand out excellent.  Pricing was okay.  The location and decor as has been mentioned is spectacular.

The real failings are, in spite of the walls they make the place feel generic, that's a difficult task to do, but they somehow did it. 

Secondly, the plating is terrible.  It really looked like I was serving guests in a casual dinner party.  They really need to work on playing.  Portion sizes are a little too small and they look worse with the poor playing.  Meat is casually on the side with couscous the focal point of attention.  No fine dining restaurant plates like this. 

Lastly, the chicken thighs were really bad. Lack of flavour, and I have a Mediterranean background, I know what it's supposed to taste like.

I'd go back, but I really hope they fixe these things."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch as I work right across the street. I didn't realize how nice the interior was and was greeted by very friendly workers. 

When we were seated, the waiter gave us a little explanation of what the name of the restaurant meant and what some of the decorations were. He was very friendly and nice 

For food, I got the chicken jalfrenzi and the fries. The fries were a little mushy for me, but the chicken dish was really good. It's supposed to be a curry dish, and it comes with some rice, salad, and naan. I was so full after."}
{"text":"The food is good, albeit portions are on the skimpy side. The ambience is really beautiful. The reason I give this place 2 stars is because the waitstaff made a big deal about giving us a nicer seat by the window, even though they knew we were celebrating an anniversary. Further, when it came to paying the bill, the waiter automatically put an 18% tip without checking with us! We were a party of 4!!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to this place. This is after two failed attempts to dine here (location doesn't help as getting here during peak hours is a chore, come to think of it can anyone explain is there a non peak hour left on DVP!)
Reservation was easy and done via open table though the place wasn't very busy for a Friday night. First the space, I found it very nice. Nice intricate setup to go with the theme of the museum. The space is huge with high high ceiling, lots of installations that represent the region along with the cutlery to go with the ambiance as well. Only comment I would make is about the dinning tables they just don't seem right for this kind of setup. Maybe white table cloth for the evening session. Ah well what do I know about interior design.
I had checked out the menu online several times already so kind of knew what they had to offer. 
Here is what we went with
Mezze platter, Turkish pastry platter and Kebab Platter (wait a sec that's a lot of platters:) 
I ordered a glass of Cabernet which was decent.
For starters they brought out a variety of breads along with couple of dips, good olive oil. Good start here as the bread variety was decent. 
Mezze and pastry platter were brought in together. 
Mezze platter was good. Various pickled vegetables. I liked the zucchini mezze. quail eggs (meh) satay chicken (completely out of place IMO) and bastrama beef (excellent as they didn't hold back on the spices here)
Mixed turkish pastries in filo dough. This was a weak offering. The fellow diner commented more like frozen version bought from the store level as nothing stood out here. 
Kebab platter. This was decent with the spicy lamb being the stand out. Chicken was OK. The Sturgeon and normal lamb were over cooked IMO. The rice one side was OK. The standout was the side of Shirazi salad. The falafel crisps were just right. Not the crisp on the out and soggy in the middle kind, makes me wonder why others don't do falafel at the this size.
Service was very good though I think they still have a bit of learning curve ahead of them. 
Overall for the price point they are hitting for dinner I would say this place is 3 stars. I might revisit this place for lunch/brunch if I am in the area or visiting this museum."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting and decor. Coffee was excellent. Food was tasty but not out of this world. The carrot upside-down cake was incredible

Unfortunately our server was not very good at reading our needs - she was overbearing when we first sat down, checking an absurd number of times if we were ready to order when we clearly hadn't even looked at our menus yet. We ordered appetizers and were enjoying them for a few minutes, but then our mains arrived and our side plates were taken away while we were still using them - we were literally about to eat off them. This is basic serving know-how. It's not our fault it was fired in the kitchen too early - the server should have held off until we were finished our appetizers. The way it all happened was so abrupt and intrusive. There honestly isn't any excuse.

Luckily she was able to continue with more adept service from that point onwards."}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients.  The curry of the day was delicious.  Service was quick and attentive."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful restaurant with a lovely view of the garden / prayer hall! Have been there for lunch three times and love the food + ambiance. 

A few things to consider ordering = bread & spreads, lamb pasta, tuna loin and milk pudding desert. The staff are lovely and knowledgeable (ask them for recommendations). Will definitely be back for dinner and to try more of the menu. 

One of the best restaurants in the area! And the museum is a must see."}
{"text":"Consistently good food in a classy ambiance. It's like a bistro in an area without many classy restaurants.

It's also pretty expensive for the area, but it seems in keeping with the quality."}
{"text":"Exemplary food and service. Highly recommended. The mix of eastern and western cuisine is amazing!!! This is fine dining at affordable prices."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best museum restaurants I have ever experienced. The decor is a pretty mix of contemporary and antique paneling. The staff is accommodating and patient (my large party had 2 rambunctious kids).

The dishes were all fantastic. The flavors were a mix of traditional spices from the cultures represented in the Aga Khan Museum, but presented in a modern fusion dish. My favorite is an excellent manti dish of lamb dumpling/ravioli with a spicy sweet tomato sauce, garlic pan fried in brown butter.  The mixed mezze was fresh and the breads are terrific.  

Even simple dishes like an omelette or a side of rice is incredibly flavorful with unexpected flavors. Lunch is a bargain and worth going to on a regular basis whether you include a museum visit or not."}
{"text":"I've been to this museum a few times and didn't even know of this restaurant -- it's tucked in at the side when you first walk in. 

The place is really cute and the patio is gorgeous. We came for lunch for summerlicious.

The place was apparently really busy previously because they were out of a lot of items. 

I had the roasted eggplant for an app, which I loved. The beef kabob for my entree - the kabob has really good flavor but I thought the meat was a bit tough. Rice seemed a bit over cooked but the hummus was lovely as well. And you can't go wrong with vanilla ice cream for dessert. 

Their juices are phenomenal! We had the watermelon and mixed it with prosecco for our own twist of mimosas. Yummmmmm!!

The service was a bit slow as well, but they were also prepping for a wedding after our reservation ended. So, I'll let that slide. Overall, it's a great place to relax for a nice meal after exploring the glorious museum."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Winterlicious here, what a beautiful restaurant! Gorgeous decor and friendly staff. The food was good, but my choices weren't completely up my street. Salad was nice, rice pilaf pastry with egg on top had an interesting herbal flavour. Fried pancake dessert stuffed with cherries and garnished with nuts was way too oily. The fried appetizer was also over done, too crunchy and powdery. Very unique cuisine if you're in the area. Won't make a trip again due to expensive parking fee."}
{"text":"Today was my dad's birthday. I've decided to come back again. We've ordered the salmon, it was a little saltier than before. But still pretty good.

My mom had the speciality of the day, these lamb kofta. My mom enjoyed it and she loved the naan. She took my brother's portion of the naan aswell!

My brother had the other speciality of the day, which is the chicken. He said it tasted good!

There are interesting freshly squeezed drinks such as lychee and cactus, which my mom ordered. Then she had the mango lassi, she liked it. The only comment she had was a bit sour. My dad ordered the mango and guava. 

One important point to mention is our waiter. He has an amazing friendly smile. Very friendly and helpful. His name was Angelo and made our dining experience very different!"}
{"text":"Had the lamb samosas, onion bhaji and biryani here today along with two of their fruit juice cocktails. I have to say the food was great. Portions are just right and the interesting take on traditional cuisine is worth trying. The ambience and service are great. A good experience overall and certainly worth trying."}
{"text":"I had high expectation but turns out it is just normal standard. Chicken is dry and the price is a bit over."}
{"text":"I finally managed to come here with some family, and apparently the menu had changed quite a bit compared to previous months. 

The decor, and view of the crystal dome of the Ismaili Centre Toronto definitely makes this restaurant experience worth while and adds to the experience. This was also on a gloomy, overcast day, so I'm excited to come back when it's sunnier and when the park will be open. 

We started with the bread with zatar butter and hummus, as well as the cucumber salad. Both were unique and delicious, although I would  think the cucumber salad is more of a warm weather item. 

For the mains, we shared the sandwich and lamb kebabs. I didn't try the sandwich, but it didn't look like anything out of the ordinary, and my family confirmed the same. 

The kebabs, however were out of this world! They were extremely tasty and well spiced and the accompanying coleslaw and long grain rice matched it well. 

We also had the saffron ice cream dessert which I would not recommend as it has a very cheese-like taste and texture.  their coffee was not bad, though. 

The service was great, the music in the background was hit or miss depending on the track (no one wants to hear an old man sing in a high-pitched tone) , and overall the experience left me wanting to return for a visit!"}
{"text":"We got accommodated at Diwan Saturday night after a trip through the Aga Khan proper and without a reservation.  

The atmosphere is impressive.  The antique paneling and ceiling fixtures are positively beautiful.  The music was present but quiet enough that it didn't interfere with our meal.  This meant other diners weren't ALSO trying to talk over it which leads to this one-upping of volume that drowns many restaurants.  I don't know why this simple thing is so hard but frankly, if you're there during prime time, you're there to see and smell and eat and talk, not listen to music anyway.

The food was beyond delicious.  My partner and I had the kebabs for two.  The bread plate that prefaced it was impressive and delightful with three different kinds of tasty flatbreads and a few spreads and oil to accompany.  

The main was awesome.  Great accompaniments, really good 'falafel crisp' salad,  nice rice.  The main reason I don't rate the place a 5 is because the sturgeon and chicken kebabs were cold by the time we reached them when neither of the lambs were which made for a disappointing finish.

We both had the saffron fried dough with figs to finish.  Again, super delicious, great accompaniments, really satisfying.  Topped off with a good coffee, great service and the space itself, we were thoroughly satisfied with this experience."}
{"text":"Visited the museum and decided to stop by the restaurant for food. Very upscale and artsy. Getting seated was odd, but the service was quick and the scene is great. Food is good and very ethnic. Mango lassi was very fresh. It is very pricey for the portions but it's a must when visiting the museum."}
{"text":"Diwan never disappoints. My husband and I have dined there 3 times and today marked our 4th visit and this time with family including a 6-year old and a 3-year old. The Service is outstanding and consistently accommodating.  The food is divine! We sampled the onion bhaji, masala fries and I had the beetroot curry which was delicately spiced with the perfect balance of flavours and the crispy onions on top were amazing.  My hubby's lamb burger was cooked perfectly and my sister's chicken salad was one of a kind especially the saffron chicken breast topped with sweet potato crisps. Are we returning? You bet!"}
{"text":"Excellent tasting food. Great service and extraordinary ambiance!

The server provided a really nice overview of the artifacts in the restaurant. The view of the Ismaili Centre is beautiful from the west side."}
{"text":"First of all, what a gorgeous space -- high ceilings, big windows letting in lots of light and offering a view of the beautiful Ismaili Centre, and exquisite hand carved wooden panels. The service is good, and adequately attentive. The food was the star of the show, however:

-Starters: The Lentil Soup was delicious and had some nice heat to it; I LOVED the rich, flavourful melange that was the Ali Nazik, with the warm flatbread accompaniment. Really kicked things off nicely!
-Mains: The cod was quite delicious, especially the perfectly done crispy skin; the Chicken Biryani just made my day though. Tasty chunks of chicken melded well together with the well-spiced rice, nuts and other bits in there.
-Desserts: I'm not a huge fan of carrot desserts but the Carrot Halwa Upside Down Cake is pretty solid. Pretty heavy for a dessert though. This was also a problem shared by the Chocolate Mousse. Things just got too heavy as I worked through the dish. The meringue and pistachio crumble on top is a fantastic garnish though!"}
{"text":"Quite quite good. The first thing that strikes you is the interior. The museum outside continues in here. The server gave us a Coles notes ver of the architecture inside and gave us a run down of the specials. We had the Ali Naik?  Absolutely delicious. The octopus salad with chickpeas. That meat was cooked so so well. Was told they boil first, then broil and lastly grill. Star of the show? 

For me at least was the kofta burger. Bejesus. I had asked for no bun or fries (Keto) he more than happily obliged and got some flafel salad on the side for me. That burger was done so well. So juicy, tender and full of flavour it was unreal. The gave some spicy mustard and yogurt on the side. Brilliant. Simple and effective. Must visit esp if you are already here."}
{"text":"Diwan (and Aga Khan) are gorgeous. Not only that, they had delicious vegan options, are wheelchair accessible (during museum hours, accessible stall one level down, not sure about when the museum is closed), and the staff were very friendly and accomodating.

The food was delicious and beautifully presented. A modern take on familiar favourites.

We will definitely try and make it out there again."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to check out this restaurant out of convenience since we were also going to look around the museum. It was easy to make an online reservation using OpenTable on the day of as well.

I really liked the Middle Eastern themed decor in this restaurant from the patterned ceiling to the lazer cut like details on some mirrors, to the antique looking frames on one of the walls. It wasn't overdone but complimented the overall ambience of the restaurant. Other girlfriends that joined us later also commented that it looked so cute with all of the subtle themed details.

In terms of food, my friend and I shared a few appetizers. We had the lamb meatballs in a curry sauce, sweet onion spinach fritters and eggplant yogurt dip. All were really good! The meatballs were a good portion (3 medium sized meatballs) and delicious with the mildly spiced curry sauce. The fritters were perfectly fried, lightly seasoned and paired well with the tamarind sauce. The taste of the eggplant yogurt dip surprised us - we didn't expect it to taste refreshing (reminded me of notes of mint but not quite that either) and it was delicious with the naan. 

The bigger than tapas style portions were filling enough for two hungry girls - there was especially a lot of dip leftover! Not bad at all for around $20 each, though I know my husband would say that $45 could have been spent on more filling mains and apps elsewhere for the same price. We definitely enjoyed our experience there though - something different and recommend others try it if you're planning to go around the museum or in the area!"}
{"text":"the location is hard to get to, but the restaurant and the surrounding area are fantastic. 

service is professional and courteous. it's a bit pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Went for winterliscious, was not disappointed.  Excellent Indian food with a slight twist.  Everything was very high quality and cooked perfectly.  The only complaint I would have is that the portions were a bit too small.  Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"2.5 actually

The restaurant was jumping and I was glad I'd made reservations or it was clear we weren't getting a seat. The place looks cool, but perhaps a little cramped. If it hadn't been so damn hot, I think I would have preferred the patio. Our server took our order quickly, but it took forever to get our food! 50 minutes to be exact. And when it showed up, I was really underwhelmed. I ordered the beef kabob sandwich. The lavash was dry and the toppings were so minimal, they did nothing to help the situation. The kabob itself was well cooked, but virtually flavourless. The sumach fries were okay but arrived without the aoli they were supposed to come with. This plate cost $18 too which is completely not worth it.

I'm not saying I wouldn't give this place a second chance, but after hearing such good things about it, I can't say I wasn't really disappointed."}
{"text":"I ate at Diwan during Winterlicious, so my experience with the restaurant itself is limited to their set menu options. I came in not knowing what to expect from a Mark McEwan restaurant, but at the same time I know he's actually not in the back cooking for us :(.

It took us a little while to get seated - perhaps OpenTable had something to do with the confused looks from the Front of House staff. Regardless, they were really welcoming. The restaurant is bright and spacious and the decor really sets the tone for the food.

The food itself was good, but I didn't find myself dying to come back every day. Writing this review several months later, I can only vaguely remember the dishes I had. A blended soup which I thought was just okay, a Chicken Biryani which was good, and the carrot cake (or at least I think it was a carrot cake) which I think was left out a little too long.

Granted, this was a Winterlicious setting, so it does warrant another try on regular day. I enjoyed the experience overall though and would try again."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Whether you've come for the Aga Khan (or not), it's worth dining at.

There's no way this won't come across as a backhanded compliment, but Diwan was much better than expected. Call me cynical, but my expectations were super low going in - I mean, how could you not for a museum-associated resto in the boonies of Eglinton and the DVP?! 

The space is beautiful with floor to ceiling windows interspersed with antique wooden panels of yore. The staff are thoughtful and polite. And the prices aren't outrageous. I came here for lunch after touring the Aga Khan (unfortunately parking is not comped for lunches, but is for dinner) and was pleasantly surprised. I'm also looking forward to their summer season when they open up their 100-seat patio and move their grilling outdoors. 

I would highly recommend starting with their seasonal MEZZE PLATTER, which for us, came with marinated olives, amazingly spiced pastirma beef, fresh slaw and some chicken skewers.

Their PERSIAN OMELETTE was decent, but I couldn't really figure what was so \"Persian\" about it. Unless you really want an omelette, you might want to try something else.

Which comes to the MIXED KEBAB GRILL, served with your choice of chicken, lamb, beef or sturgeon. I would definitely recommend the sturgeon - not only is it not frequently served in restos, but it has a very nice meaty texture that does well to survive on the grill. The accompanying rice was also fragrant and delicious.

All in all, my DC and I came away impressed with the quality and value of Diwan. I would definitely like to come back for their dinner offerings and provide an updated review then."}
{"text":"I'm a member of the museum and always try to leave time for a visit to the restaurant while there.

My first time, my dad and I had what were easily the *best* burgers - these made of lamb - that either of us had ever had. And since my mom makes one hell of a burger, that is a high compliment. 

The second, my mom ordered an eggplant dish and I suggested the sumac fries. A 78-year-old lady tossed aside her eggplant and happily ate only the fries for lunch - then went out to order some sumac only to discover it really is more than just the spices. It's the way they do it at Diwan. 

Yesterday my friends ordered the sizzling tikka chicken. We were influenced by the smell of it wafting from across the restaurant when someone else got it - yes, we were sheep. But for this quality and taste, it's worth it!

I've never had a meal there that wasn't to the highest quality, seasoned beautifully, impeccably prepared, with exemplary customer service and absolutely memorable.

If I had one request, it would be more vegetarian options. It's one of the few places I stray from my usual being Kosher and thus not eating meat (I like to tell myself that being in a Muslim museum, the meat is Halal. My head knows it's not. But I do try to fool myself...)"}
{"text":"Rating: 4.5*

Diwan is a beautifully designed restaurant inside the architecturally stunning Aga Khan Museum at Don Mills. The restaurant is accessible by TTC or vehicle (there is a flat parking fee of $10), and is located to the right of the entrance of the museum. Since late last year, the kitchen has been headed by celebrity chef, Mark McEwan, who is known for his culinary skills and established restaurants such as North 44, ByMark, One, and more. McEwan's culinary background isn't Middle Eastern food, but he does a great job of executing a menu that highlights the bold flavors that this type of cuisine is known for. They don't claim to be authentic, but the food is put together with precision and great care that complements the museum. Diwan is open for lunch from Tuesday to Sunday from 11:30 am to 2:30 pm.

Diwan's decor evokes the luxury of a 19th century private Syrian home, and its menu draws inspiration from Middle Eastern, North African, and Indian cuisine. Additionally, the 65-seat restaurant is filled with natural lighting, giving it a bright, contemporary and modern ambiance allowing guests a great view of the adjacent Ismaili Centre. Chef McEwan and his team has created a menu with their take on Pan-Islamic cuisine that includes starters like goat kafta, roasted beet salad, lamb kibbeh, and entrees like grilled beef shish kebab, and chicken jalfrezi. The dishes are said to offer traditional flavors while adding a more modern flare to them in terms of ingredients, and presentation.

The Goat Kafta ($12) - braised goat meatballs, curry sauce, warm naan, was a manageable size for a starter, and a great introduction to what is to come. Four plump goat meatballs surrounded by an overflow of delicious curry sauce, and served with warm naan.

The starters menu offers an array of tantalizing choices, but I opted for the Grilled Octopus ($17) - green chickpea salad, Moroccan olives, sweet stewed peppers, sujuk, and Aleppo pepper aioli. The octopus was perfectly cooked, and had a nice tender texture to it. Aleppo pepper is a spice that is commonly used in Middle Eastern cuisine, and has a moderate heat level. I could definitely taste a hint of spice in the octopus, and it was just the right amount.

My choice of main was the Chermoula-Marinated Prawns ($24) - with roasted heirloom carrots, avocado, labneh, orange-cumin vinaigrette, and fresh coriander. The dish was well presented with a bed of salad topped off with six pieces of prawns, and lightly glazed with orange-cumin vinaigrette and labneh. The portion was a little small for an entree compared to my fiancé's dish. However, I loved the addition of the orange-cumin vinaigrette as it added a nice citrus flavoring to the prawns. I don't regret ordering this dish.

The Carrot Halva Upside Down Cake ($10) - all spice, brown sugar reduction, cream cheese icing contained a healthy chunk of real carrots, and was delicious. This dessert is the Diwan team's modern interpretation of the popular dessert using grated carrots and halva. This was my first time trying halva, and I learned that it's a dense and sweet confection of Arabic origin that is popular across the Middle East, and South/North Africa. 

Overall, we had an enjoyable lunch in a lovely atmosphere. Diwan at the Aga Khan Museum was a little far for us, but we made it count as we also shopped for a few things at McEwan's nearby grocery store after lunch."}
{"text":"So I wanted to check this place out since it's by mark mcewan and the prices were pretty reasonable considering it's in a museum and it's by mark mcewan.

I really love the Moroccan coffee.  It's totally different from having a cup of coffee from timmies.  They give a stick of candy and at first I had no clue what to do with it.  I was about to eat it ok it's own u too my friend said it was for my coffee. Yes I can be that clueless.  I usually drink my coffee black.

I got the marsala fries which I loved and the eggplant dip which was also yummy.  

The decor in the restaurant is beautiful.  Great for taking IG photos.  I would only go back if they change the menu since they change it up every 6 months."}
{"text":"We came for the summerlicious, the patio was quite nice even the day we went was a bit hot. The parking was $10 flat, it is very expensive consider it is not at the prime downtown location on a weekend. And we were not going to be there long enough to make the $10 worth it. 

Overall the meal was not bad, for $28 per person, we had the deep fried onion/grilled eggplant for appetizer, salmon as main course and panna cotta for dessert. The portion was big for appetizer and dessert. 

Consider the expensive parking, even the meal was nice I am not sure if I would go back.."}
{"text":"We all had a lovely lunch yesterday. With fine service. And a happy view. Lovely architecture. Mild curry, or interesting salads. Only accessible by car. In the Aga Khan museum, but you don't have to pay admission to dine. They do charge $10 for parking, which is surprising."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The decor is amazing, staff is very friendly and food is perfect. A bit pricy but hey, you get quality food. You also get a nice view of the Ismaili centre (pyramid style) from inside the restaurant. 

The restaurant is always packed but didn't have to wait too long. The concierge took our cell number and got automated message in few mins. 

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Location:
It's located in the Aga Khan Museum on Wynford drive. I think you basically have to drive, it's in the middle of nowhere. i'm not even sure if a bus goes by, if it does it's limited.  Also, no one says this, but you are forced to pay $10 to park there, so make sure to factor that into your budget if you are coming. Carpool.

Decor:
The place is real nice! It's clean and simple. There are floor to ceiling windows so it's nice and bright.  The walls and ceilings are  decorated with 19th century carved wooden panels from Damascus.  There's a poem in arabic written across the panels. Nice

Menu:
I like when a restaurant puts items from their regular menu on their 'licious offerings. I use them to try out new places.  Diwan did that.  The food is a combination of the Middle East, North Africa, and India.  The three dishes I picked were  the Imam Bayildi (Smoked Eggplant), Aloo Gobi, and the melon salad for dessert.

Food:
Imam Bayildi was my entre.  This dish was delicious. Honestly, if they would have put this dish in front of me for all three courses I would have been fine with it, that's how much I loved it.  The only problem with it was I wished it came on a full platter so I could eat it for days! The dish was  smoked eggplant with Tahini Yogurt, Pine Nuts, Pomegranate &  seated on an amazing minted Chickpea Couscous Salad. Yum and Drool.

Next I had the \"Aloo Gobi\" with Roasted Cauliflower Steak Ragda Pattice, Sweet Peas, Green Chutney, Raita and Fried Onions.  I'm not sure why it's in quotation marks.

This one cause a problem for me.As soon as they placed the dish in front of me i knew I couldn't eat it. The smell from the red sauce was so off putting.  It smelled like concentrated spaghetti o's sauce. *shudder*.  I thought that maybe I could  hold my nose but when i tasted it - nope.  I felt weird asking the waitress to take it away. I normally eat anything Put it in front of me and I'll try it.  Nope not this. They were nice enough to make me another one with out the sauce , It was delicious, so delicious.  I'd like to note that there was a woman at the next table who got the same thing and she didn't like the red sauce either.

My final course was the Minted Melon Salad with Sweetened Labneh, Great way to end the meal. One thing, you can tell they cut the melons probably the day before, they had that fermented softish edge on them.

My friend got the Sweet Onion Bhaji with Tamarind Chutney. I tried it and didn't really like it very much. She didn't finish it. but thought it was okay.  Her main was Beef Kofta Kebab with Shirazi Salsa, Hummus, Toum, Rice and Naan. She really liked it. She hoovered it up. It smell and looked delicious..  She ended with mango sorbet.  it had a cookie. Okay, call it the 12 year old boy inside but they looked liked a penis with testicles.  presentation is everything people.

Thoughts:
So what do I think?  Food was great. Wait staff amazing, Want to try out their weekend patio specials. Miffed off that I had to pay for parking in the middle of nowhere.  Food was good. would only go back if someone else drove and paid for parking.  ( not sure why this is bothering me so much)"}
