{"text":"Food here is some of the best I'm town. Service is always great and the happy hour is the best. I've seen Don Smith eat here several times, so that should tell you right there that its high quality."}
{"text":"The lobster in the quesadilla was fishy. The calamari was COVERED in breading. The firecrackers were the only thing we kind of enjoyed. The margarita only tasted like to the mix. 3 apps and 1margaritaand our bill was $40. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Finding a restaurant that can satisfy both the kids and the parents is not easy.  Cabana's did it!
The patio was very pleasant.  Our waitress was attentive and prompt.  
Much better experience than any of the chains in Mentor. 
Jamaican Me Crazy - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ok, Cabana's is exactly what it looks like.

Cheesy \"tropical\" food in a family friendly setting. Essentially Margaritaville with better food. 

Went here with a large party (in laws were in town) as a sort of a last minute decision, and they were accomodating. The waitress was excellent and timely and good to banter with. My uncle loves razzing service for kicks, and she was able to dish it out, so kudos.

Service was good for the size of our party, decor was well... what are you going to expect at a place named Cabana's? The food was actually fairly good. The Lobster mac 'n' cheese was extremely rich with a good amount of lobster, burgers were good, nice selection of tropical mix drinks and such, the fish tacos went over well with everyone.

Its good food, but this IS the kind of place that uses McDonalds-y fries and velveeta nacho cheese and call a bacon cheeseburger an \"island burger\" (not making that up), if you catch my drift."}
{"text":"Food not bad. Customer service sucks!  Never been to a place where they hold your credit card 'cause they're afraid you'll run away. Must be attracting a great clientele"}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurant that brings out the entree first, salads second, and the margaritas and appetizer last!?!? The food was average and the service was terrible and extremely slow. My husband is a big tipper and he had a hard time leaving anything. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived at 6pm on a Friday night. The place was not busy.  I asked to be seated on the patio (the large patio very visible in the front of the restaurant) and there were literally 4 servers standing there looking at me and each other like I was insane.  So I go the message that they did not want to seat anyone outside.  Why I do not know as it was a beautiful evening.  Anyway we sat inside and I kept getting a faint wiff of a smell like an old mop or something.  The food was ok but nothing extraordinary.  I would really just prefer to go to one of the usual national chain restaurants than go back."}
{"text":"Closed.  It's for the best."}
{"text":"I've given this place a shoot and overall I wasn't impressed. There was noting great about this place. The crab cakes were over cooked and lacked crab. The chicken sandwich was on par with any fast food grilled chicken sandwich. The service was fine but again nothing super. This is just your average bar food nothing to get excited over. I may give them another chance if I'm in a pinch for lunch one day."}
