{"text":"Cookie has the best latin food in the city- Hands Down. She even delivers!
Definitely worth checking out, if you are looking for something unique, organic, gluten free and delicious."}
{"text":"Best Colombian in town!! 

Natalia \"cookie\" Martinez baked goods have made me look good in three different continents, and were super appreciated gifts: her guava jam, the amazing Alfajores, and the vegan and coffee cookies were loved by everyone that tried them.Her empanadas, and the sauce with them are just amazing. All is delicious!! I used Natalia's services for Catering, Office events, and to treat friends to lunch on Fridays. Nothing but RAVING reviews!! If you are near the Kensington Market, stop for some yummy Colombian food. You won't be sorry. She has a few vegan and several vegetarian choices also!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Colombian food!!! Fair prices, owner managed and delicious.  Have been there several times!"}
{"text":"Cookie is hanging in a shipping container doing her thing, oblivious to the clanging of the street car going along Dundas and drunkenly lurching around the bend where is snakes by Scadding Court Community Centre and the lovely Alexandra Park Swimming Pool. Gotta respect her for doing that.
I saw the sign, 'Get ur Coffee Here' and realizing that it was a Columbian kiosk and Columbians know a thing or two about coffee, I thought I'd give it a whirl and so glad I did. I was served a delicious Americano and sat down in front of the container watching life go by that balmy December afternoon as if it were Springtime. The 'crickets for a limited time' sign caught my eye too. This little haven of culinary delights never fails to impress. Wow, insects as a snack,? very cool. Sometime I'll go back to try some, mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Drawn by the \"Get your coffee here\" sign, I love this little joint. Great service, delicious  Chicken Arepas, and a perfectly brewed cup of coffee. Too bad I was in the rush so didn't get a chance to try other food and Columbian drinks. Definitely will return,"}
{"text":"The food and desserts are delicious. The chef is funny and informative of the food. The price is right for the quality and quantity. Support a local entrepreneur. I'm not in the area often but when I am I always pop by for a visit and food."}
{"text":"I love this little corner mini restaurant. Natalia makes delicious arepas and desserts (cookies with ice cream).
There is also a while variety of Columbian drinks on sale as well as coffee. 
The coconut ice cream with chocolate cookies (these cookies have so many cool ingredients!!!) Is absolute amazing dessert and the trip to this place is absolutely required when you crave for something delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here to try some Columbian food. Had the following:
-Beef arepa - sandwich with buns made from cornmeal (soft and delicate) ground beef cooked with pickled veggies. Tasted much better after adding the flavorful sauce provided.
-Patacon Pisao with chicken - think tostada made with a fried plantain as the base. Nice textures and flavors.

I was disappointed because she no longer serves her ice cream sandwiches nor alfajores and she wasn't serving any insect dishes today. For dessert she is now selling ice pops by Angie. Grateful to have tried Columbian fast food, on to the next adventure!"}
{"text":"Cookie is fabulous! I've been to her container at Market 707 a few times last summer and it's always been a pleasure. Her Arepas are very good and filling and she carries some tasty soda drinks from Colombia. She's also wonderful to chat with and knows how to put a lovely smile on your face. Anybody wanting a taste of Colombian street-food will enjoy their experience here."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place one afternoon on our way through the neighborhood, made note, and returned the next day for dinner. I was glad to see she is on Yelp so I could give it my rave review. We had four different things off the menu, both the Colombian food and the ice cream sammies. The Colombian food was fresh, delicious, and inexpensive - we got a lot for the $$. The sammies topped off the meal perfectly. Cookie is friendly and personable. If we lived in Toronto, we'd be back and back and back. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I was very excited when Cookie's container opened. The quality of the food and the tastes are worth the trip. The empanadas, ceviche and cookies  are my favourites. Colombian food lends itself to being street food, and this is my favourite location and chef to buy from. When the weather warms up her ice cream sandwiches, are again worth the trip. a secret tip: if you are in the hospital row area of Toronto (University /Gerrard). Take the free shuttle from TGH to Toronto Western, cross the street and indulge in some South American treats. Hop back on the shuttle (every 15 minutes) and your lunch break done in an hour, is a true break:-)"}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick lunch. The empanadas were delicious. Hot and fresh! I also had a coffee and it was great. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I was very impressed to see a place for Colombian food while visiting Toronto for Caribana. We ordered beef arepa, chicken empanada, and beef patacon. I gotta give props for serving these items to an audience that probably has never seen an arepa or a patacon before. But then again,Torontonians are a group of sophisticated foodies.  

I did ask for aguapanela to which Cookie promptly showed me the sign, only available certain months. Opps.

Our order came out quickly and this is when I have to say, I was not as impressed with the food itself. It was not bad, but it was not what I was accustomed to eating or cooking in Colombia. 

C'est la vie! I came, I ate, and I left."}
{"text":"Mmmm Colombian food! How can I say no to a Colombian food stand with a friendly lady selling Colombian coffee?

Got Iced Colombian Coffee and two Empanadas. Beef Empanadas was defintely much better than the chicken one. Coffee was amazing..I would go out of my way for their coffee again if I'm ever in that area."}
{"text":"Cookies, arepas and empanadas what more could you want? honestly, if you haven't heard of cookie yet you have now, she's amazing. granted cookies are on the pricey side especially those yummy alfajores but everything else is pretty reasonable. Now that winter has finally come, there's limited seating and the Scadding Court market so it's best to grab and go until spring time.

What a great place for Colombian street food that doesn't break the bank, or your stomach"}
{"text":"Any cookie monster will love Cookie Martinez! The Super Mega Vegan Cookie ($2.50) consists of Flaxseeds, Organic Flour, Organic Oats, Mango, Ginger, Coconut, Natural Whole Almonds, Organic Goji Berries and 65% Chocolate from Chocosol! Nom nom nom! Happy belly food is a perfect way to start your morning! Can't wait till they start selling ice cream sandwiches towards the end of April!"}
{"text":"This place is a regular go to for myself and my friends. It has opened up our eyes to a world of Colombian eats outside of empanadas. Everything we have had has not disappointed. Cookie, the owner, is also sociable, caring, and so funny! Her sauce is to die for especially with her fresh made arepas (if you're not sure, do add queso to your order!) with the cold setting in, the hot sugar cane is  a very comforting and soothing finish. The best is to check on Facebook to see if there are any changes to her hours as she also caters."}
{"text":"The menu may be small but the taste is large and the portions size only compounds the deliciousness. Unique but somehow familiar food is Cookie's specialty and it works perfectly. You can take it home, eat at one of the picnic tables along the very wide sidewalk or take it to the park. Long time regular customer; I highly recommend Cookie's food."}
