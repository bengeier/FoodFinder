{"text":"Can't wait til this place opens!!!!! I already know it's going to be amazing with the crew and owners they have starting it up!!! I was lucky enough to get a sample of one of the speciality pies and it was the best pizza I've had! (And I'm from Jersey so that's saying alot!!) After all, the Chef is from NEW YORK. he can Jay walk AND make a damn good pizza ...man of many talents  make sure you come give it a try next week!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza! The crust, sauce and toppings are amazing. Great staff, very knowledgeable and friendly. We will be regulars."}
{"text":"Ok guys, I don't leave reviews unless they are 5 star. Chef Bill has created a unique pizza bistro! You will not regret trusting his flavor combos(with which they do  not allow substitutions) on purpose!!! Eva and I already adore Flat Iron Grill, his newest creation Mandolino's is such an awesome experience, if you can appreciate a true artistic representation of flawless pizza, then this is your place. Leah was our waitress, nothing but stellar!!! If you want an authentic experience enjoying absolutely fantastic food that is designed and prepared by a true culinary expert then this is your place if not at Flat Iron Grill!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I was looking forward to a good pizza, since that and salads are all that is on the menu.  Pizza was ok, but I really like a good pizza sauce, and this pie had none...... not too little, none.  Toppings, I ordered the Pigs on the wing speciality pie, but I could not see very much sweet sausage or taste it.  Good atmosphere, good service, but the pizza is not.  Also, order wine by the bottle, because the pour was extremely slim.  Won't be back too soon.  Alinos is a much better bet.  Walked over to Flat Iron for a full glass of wine after we finished."}
{"text":"Amazingly tastey pizza. Best I've ever had since I lived in New York! Have been there twice with friends and everyone loved the Pizza as much as I did. The service was fantastic. Expect to go there again soon. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Great food, however, like many restaurants in Davidson, a bit overpriced and may have some folks coming in sparingly.  That said, enjoyable atmosphere, unique and fresh ingredient pizza is really really good.  Absolutely worth stopping in for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"One of our new favorite places. This is how pizza should taste!!! Service great! Food phenomenal."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. Nice wine and beer selection. Pizzas are unique. New York, New York pizza is wonderful. Tupelo Honey is sweet with a touch of spice. Pinwheels are a great appetizer. Staff is attentive and owner/management works the tables and takes care of you."}
{"text":"The crust is perfectly crispy and the ingredients are obviously of high quality.  The speciality pizzas have complementary flavors and are well thought out. We visited with a group of three families with 7 kids and all were very happy. Especially the kiddos.  Oh and the green goddess dressing is fantastic."}
{"text":"Best of the best ingredients, Sicilian shape but NY thin.  The perfect pizza and wonderful owners!"}
{"text":"I'll give it a second star because the staff was very friendly and accommodating. But when the only items on your very limited and overpriced menu are pizza and salads, they had better be phenomenal. I wasn't impressed with either. We ordered a caprese salad that had three slices of dry rubbery mozzarella and four charred yet flavorless cherry tomatoes along with some bland EVO, a decent balsamic, a little pesto, and some microgreens. Not worth $9 in my opinion. Also ordered a pizza with sausage and pepperoni. About half of the pepperonis were burnt. Not crispy, burnt. Most of the pizza had no sausage on the slices, and at least one piece didn't have any cheese on it either. The pizza here is cooked and served on half-sized sheet pans, and while the corners had some color, the sides and bottoms had no char or color. While technically it was cooked through, I would still consider it underdone. The middle six slices were also soaked in grease on the botttom. At a $20 price point ($14 for the base pie, $3 each for the burnt pepperoni and nonexistent sausage) I expected much more in terms of quality."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! The crust is light and crisp, but not thin-- perfection. Sauce is delicious and toppings of very high quality. The staff is friendly, service fast but not rushed. We will be regulars for sure. Davidson is lucky to have Mandolino's!"}
{"text":"We had a delightful afternoon pizza on their front patio.   We enjoyed a pizza with mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes. Nice thin crust with a northeastern style sauce. We had carry-out from here once before and this dine-in experience produced much better pizza.   The service was first rate, and the location (outside at the intersection) was ideal for people-watching.   Our family felt that two $$ is a little low for the price range we experienced - building your own pizza from a menu with limited toppings (good quality but limited) is prohibitively expensive for our little family; for example $5 to add mushrooms.  We will be back for sure, but will order smarter next time."}
{"text":"Ventured out in the rain for a girls night to Mandilino's. For pizzas, WOW, it is pricey. Yes, they use high quality ingredients, but wow. I was surprised.  They serve half sheet pan style artisan pizzas. The Tupelo Honey is very good, but it could use some chicken on it. It would've been much better with a protein. The arugula salad was a good size and the dressing was very good, but I was expecting more protein.   The draft beer menu was small which was a little surprising given the menu is predominantly pizza. I decided to save my calories for a second slice and skipped on a beer.  For a Thursday night this place was PACKED. We had to wait 25 minutes to dine and unfortunately because of the rain, we were waiting cramped behind the hostess stand. Busy nights happen, but space is limited.   An ok, just not amazing experience."}
{"text":"Best pizza that I have had in a long time!  This is a thicker style buttery pan pizza crust with high end ingredients.  The arugula salad was amazing and had just the right balance of goat cheese, onions, and honey. Bottles of wine or Prosecco are available and my only complaint is that they only have a few beers on tap.   Typically it is hard to get in as seating is limited, so go on a week night to give it a shot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed.  Staff was good and great location.   But as for the pizza -  nothing to write home about.  No taste very little toppings.  Leaving very dissatisfied.  Alinos in Mooresville is a much better bet."}
{"text":"Our new favorite restaurant in Davidson! Nice, inviting atmosphere with great music playing and cool art on the walls. Excellent service and friendly staff. Great wine selection and local beers. Our children don't usually love pizza (weird, right?!) but the pie here always gets two thumbs up from both. The crust is perfect - not too thin and not too thick. Mandalino's is an awesome new addition for downtown Davidson!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place even though I tend to go more for thin crust pizza. It was very trendy and had a great vibe. The pizza was very good as well as the salad. I would totally recommend going here and I think it's a great spot for families as well. You can't beat downtown Davidson."}
{"text":"Would I eat here again?   No!  The space was nice.  The pizza was bland.   The portion size was ok.   We had a cheese pizza  and a pepperoni/sausage pizza. My wife had a salad.  They offered feta, but it was actually goat cheese.  I don't know the difference, but she can tell.  She also made a comment that the glass of wine was not  a normal pour.  She thought it was more like half a pour.  We also were given dirty plates for our pizza. The pizza itself was was kind of a hand tossed thickness.  It wasn't very cheesy and didn't have much sauce.  It was more like breadsticks to me than pizza.   I would go to Alinos or vinyl PI instead.  I would even recommend brick house or fuel for pizza in Davidson.  Sorry but we won't be back."}
{"text":"They apparently are not opened according to the hours displayed on their yelp page, the hours need to be updated. It currently says 11pm on Sunday. The door was opened and when we walked in they said they were closing at 9."}
{"text":"Having now eaten here a few times, it is definitely a different style of pizza than you can get anywhere in the area.  Large rectangular pizza could feed four people.  They have gluten-free crust and vegan cheese.  I have not tried it but have heard it is good.  It is a larger pizza also, so it could be enough for three people.    I recently had a meeting for lunch and enjoyed their $10 lunch special of a very large slice and salad with a beverage.  It was a lot of food and very good.    I have had the Pigs on the Wings and another one I can't recall at the moment.  Both were very good.  They have wine and beer downstairs and more seating and full bar upstairs.  The entire town seems to go home around 11pm (really 9pm - seriously, just drive through the town after 9pm...sign), so Mandalino's followed suit with their closing schedule.  We've been right before 11pm and it was just us...sigh!  GET OUT PEOPLE!  Enjoy the pizza and check out their personal brunch pizzas on Sunday & other specials throughout the week.  Well done, Mandalino's!"}
{"text":"Lovely new place for Davidson.  Stopped by for lunch on Sunday with my hubby and two little kids.  Everyone (including other patrons!) were so friendly and welcoming.  I just loved the atmosphere there.  Hannah was our server and she was great.  She walked us they the menu options and we ended up sharing the arugula salad and the loveit pizza.  So delicious!  My 3 year old wanted ice cream, so we topped off our meal with gelato which was also delicious.  I will admit, I miss the old Millstone bakery that used to be in this location, but I am happy to know I can still get some yummy carbs here! The pizza is top notch :)  We will be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in a long time!! Perfect crust and ratio of ingredients. Ate past the point of being full because I couldn't stop!"}
{"text":"Yay for awesome pizza in downtown Davidson! The pizza here was delicious and if you are looking for a typical cliche pie, this is not what you will find here.  It's artisan pizza, so every pie is going to be beautifully different. The ingredients are way above average and when it came out, you could tell that it was hand-crafted. I love sauce and cheese, so if you want a heavier hand, ask for extra and you will not be disappointed. It was all super fresh and the crust was perfection. It even reheated perfectly in the oven, which NEVER happens, so that was a bonus because we couldn't finish it all while there.  The wine selection is wonderful and the service was great for a brand new place that literally just opened its doors.  We will be making it a staple!"}
{"text":"I attended a private event upstairs last night. What an amazing experience! The space held about 40 people. And we were all comfortable.  An intimate setting, with beautiful window views of downtown Davidson. The food, as expected, was fantastic. Everyone was commenting on how great everything tasted. This is a wonderful space if you need a location for any event.... Celebrations, receptions, business meetings. And parking was not an issue, even though there was an event nearby."}
{"text":"First time trying Mandilino's and it did not disappoint! The Caprese Seasonal appetizer was delicious. The pizza is big and fed our family of three with a piece leftover. Ingredients are high quality and very yummy while the crust is deliciously crisp on each piece. The service was excellent with a very attentive waiter. Would most definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Had very high hopes for this place as we patiently waited for it to finally open. Interior is very nice and inviting. The menu is very limited, with no appetizers? More wine/beer selection than food, which is odd. Did not get straws with our water. We ordered a red pizza with different toppings on each side. Watched several tables get seated and order well after us but our food came out much later. Apparently they cooked it wrong the first time, but the pizza they finally brought out was burnt so bad on the sides that 1/3 of the pizza wasn't really edible unless you like the flavor of burnt crust. Surprised management didn't bring the pizza and apologize that it took so long, he spent plenty of time talking to other patrons he knew. The toppings were very generous and the pizza was okay, nothing to write home about. I liked the topping selection that's available. Will wait a few months until kinks are worked out and give it one more shot."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pizza! It is rectangular and not just your run of the mill menu. I thought the sauce, crust and toppings were great. It was not greasy. My super picky 9 year old thought i was great! Server was fantastic and attentive even while they were busy on a Friday night. Nice open floor plan and you get a glimpse of where the cooking happens. I absolutely had to find anything wrong...I would say the draft beer I ordered was not that cold. It was great tasting but they might need to keep it at a colder temp or serve in a cold glass. But we will absolutely be back! I recommend going with the \"red\" pie and choosing your own toppings."}
