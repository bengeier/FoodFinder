{"text":"A good example of picking something and doing it well. In this case, bagel sandwiches.for breakfast and lunch. The bagels are fresh and the deli meats/cheeses are good quality. Tucked within a nondescript strip mall on south boulevard, you've driven past it a thousand times, but it's worth a stop."}
{"text":"Long time to wait to get a mediocre bacon egg and cheese on a bagel different from what I requested"}
{"text":"Love this place! Yummy bagels and an endless variety of sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This is not a place I probably would have stopped at had I not bought a living social voucher. So glad I did, love the casual atmosphere and the food was great. The giant peanut butter cup cookie I bought was to die for!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Charlotte for 2 years. The opening of Owen's within walking distance of our house changed my world, and made me a much happier Charlottean. 
Ambling over on Saturday and/or Sunday mornings to read the paper and munch on a Hangover Helper was the best part of my week. The fact that they included a fountain soda along with an egg, cheddar and sausage (that's what I got on it, anyway) onion bagel sandwich immediately impressed me regarding how well they knew what cured my hangovers.
Oh, and the Chia Bagel, Hot Tuna Meltdown, and Banana Surprise are other favorite menu items.  
I'm no longer a resident, but Owen's is always one of my first stops back in town. Last week we were in Charlotte for four days - four days made great by three lunches at Owen's!"}
{"text":"Great little shop in South End.  Excellent selection of bagel sandwiches.  Line can take awhile if early weekend morning - suggest calling order in ahead of time if possible.  Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Definitely a delicious bagel. The bagels come steamed so they're nice and soft and make for a great sandwich. 

The atmosphere inside the restaurant is great, there is interesting writing up and down all the walls and plenty to look at while you're waiting for your food to be prepared. It was a nice day so we ate outside at one of the picnic tables they had there.

The staff was friendly and helpful and made it a pleasant experience.

It's a little hard to find off the road so keep your eyes open and to get inside you have to go into the \"Pavilion\" entrance and walk by a nail salon (...ugh to all the smells that entails).

I'll certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"Ordered an everything bagel with cream cheese and was disgusted to find egg, peanut butter AND a sunflower seed in the aluminum foil. NOT how I wanted my Saturday morning to start. No bagel in Charlotte compares to Poppy's Bagels."}
{"text":"So delish! The food was amazing and the place is super cool. The owner is so sweet, which is an awesome plus!"}
{"text":"Owen's Bagel & Deli has committed war crimes against my taste buds.  These are the worst bagels I've ever had that weren't purchased from a supermarket or a dirty food truck.  I took two bites and threw out my very expensive breakfast.

Ignore the other reviews for Owen's.  It's clear that these people have no idea what a bagel is supposed to taste like.  This place is a joke.  Let's get specific:

#1)  Flavor:  there isn't any.  These things have all the excitement of wonder bread.

#2)  Texture:  Mush.   Bagel's are supposed to be soft, dense and chewy on the inside with a crispy but yielding skin on the outside.   At Owen's you get a steamed pile of mushy goo.  Yes, STEAMED... more on that in a moment.

#3)  Toppings:  As any true New Yorker would do, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese a lox (that's smoked salmon for you North Carolina natives).  The fish they served me smelled really bad- not fresh at all... but what can you expect from an establishment that prides itself on Boar's Head meats?  Sidenote: Boar's Head is the Hunt's ketchup of deli meats- an inferior product that somehow maintains astonishing market share, despite offending anyone with taste buds.

Okay, so back to the part where they STEAMED my bagel:  I had asked for a TOASTED onion bagel, because that's the proper way to warm a bagel.  The moron behind the counter nodded dumbly and didn't mention that apparently Owen's doesn't OWN A TOASTER!   Instead, without informing me, she STEAMS my bagel, turning it instantly into soft, gooey mess, without even a hint of the crispy crust that the bagel may have started with.  If any heating method is the exact opposite of toasting a bagel, it's STEAMING a bagel.  It's like steaming a pizza or a hamburger... you just don't do it. 

If I could give Owen's Bagel's a rating with negative stars, that's what I'd be doing right now. 

After throwing out the worst bagel ever from Owen's, I drove a few minutes away to Bruegger's.   Sure, Bruegger's in a boring chain, but they at least know how to make a bagel that doesn't suck, and they understand how to work a toaster.  Also their smoked salmon was fresh.  I never thought I'd recommend them over an independently owned Bagel shop, but in this case, I have to."}
{"text":"Years ago, my friend Jen raved about the steamed bagel sandwiches that she'd eaten while attending school in Ohio.  She couldn't contain her excitement about Bagel & Deli coming to Charlotte, and right down the road from her house no less!  I'll admit that I was somewhat dubious about the idea of something tasty coming from Ohio, and the idea of steaming a bagel just seemed strange and inappropriate, like eating chili on spaghetti noodles.  Steamed bread?  I cringed at the thought of the microwave sandwiches I ate in elementary school.  Boy, was I wrong.  Steamed bagels ARE good.  I like them, I like them, Sam I Am.  

If you're heading to Owens for the first time, prepare yourself for being overwhelmed by the menu options.  You're going to go all deer-in-the-headlights and stuff.  Not only is the printed menu extensive, but there are construction paper signs hanging on a line displaying some of their more creatively titled menu items; hung there to distract you and cause you to inexplicably stare for minutes on end.   There is a seemingly endless list of fantastic sandwiches for you to choose from, or you can create and name your very own bagel sandwich creation.  

I've only had one sub-par experience here but it was during a weird time of day when I'd imagine the third stringers were in the game.  I think that the vast majority of people are like me and enjoy eating at Owens after a long night out with friends, but this is a great place for breakfast or lunch any old day."}
{"text":"Great service and food. All of the employees are so nice. My bagel was toasted just right."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Cool, eclectic, local vibe. Great food! Very friendly staff. I had the Paul Reuben for lunch, and it was the bomb! Price is right too! Highly recommend a visit. Right across from Mr. K's but its tucked back so you could almost miss it, but don't!"}
{"text":"It was just ok. Clearly workers didn't want to be there at 9am on Sunday. Very funky.  Tons of toys for little kids which would be nice if I had em. Got ET bagel with cream cheese. Not impressed."}
{"text":"OWen's is my go-to place for lunch. For less than $10 you can get a great sandwich, chips and a drink. They have a large selection of sandwich choices, so you are likely to get exactly what you want. I read the other reviews and would like to note that THEY HAVE A TOASTER YES! Their policy is to steam everything, so you have to be clear if you do not want that. 

My fave is their wraps. A bagel all the time is a lot of calories and they have all the veggies i want for a delish wrap. I also recently tried their potato salad and LOVE IT! Compared to the other options in the neighborhood, this is the most affordable, locally owned, healthy option available. And they are always open to making me whatever I am in the mood for that day. Great staff! See you soon :)

My top menu choices:
Their Lox sandwich is AWESOME (they add cucumbers yum)
Dilworth (cream cheese and veggies)
WRAPS!! (they will put anything they have)

They also carry tea CHEERWINE Diet Dr.Pepper and keep hot sauce behind the counter. All this place needs is more business!"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and tasty too.  I get the chicken salad on a bagel and have been pleased.  Service is also upbeat and inviting."}
{"text":"Having a place to go for a real ny bagel is important, but a bagel deli that also offers creative sandwich combinations, friendly staff, and is convenient to my office job is why this place gets 5 stars! Was going to do 4 because they didn't tell me they had run out of sprouts for the Hot Piece of Ash sandwich, but, way worth it!!"}
{"text":"As a admitted bagel-snob, I seriously don't understand the hype about this place. Definitely not a New York-quality bagel if you're looking for that, and not as cheap as it should be. The fillings aren't bad, but the bagels are just plain bad. They're not dense and don't crunch on the bottom like a true bagel should. I actually went twice because I wanted to give them a second chance and see if maybe I just went on a bad day. The second time was just as bad. Not worth the trip or the money."}
{"text":"I LOVE OWEN'S BAGEL! They have the best bagels in town. My favorite lunch bagel is the Tonya Harding. The best thing about their bagels is they are steamed before serving. Make anything a combo at lunch with chips & drink. A very ecclectic dining room with mix matched chairs & tables with customer's graffiti on the wall."}
{"text":"Try your bagel steamed. Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best bagel sandwich EVER! I go to Owen's every weekend for their \"Mark Cuban Lookalike\" sandwich because I am seriously addicted. The avocado is always perfectly ripe on this perfectly hot bagel sandwich. Their cheesy grits are the best in Charlotte. One day they ran out of grits and we were very disappointed because our 14 month old daughter loves them. They quickly made an extra batch just for us! The manager brought it to our table herself. Good food and great people!!!"}
{"text":"They always have the best tasting bagels for a morning pick me up, their staff is always so nice and helpful. I'm slowly making my way through their menu, but really the classic steamed bagel with cream cheese is best in my book."}
{"text":"Owen's Bagel is THE BEST!! What an insanely awesome menu, and everything on it is so tasty. The team there is also out of this world. My day is always better after a visit to Owen's."}
{"text":"I hate that I have to rate this place as 1 star, but it has to be done.  I was so overwhelmingly disappointed with my experience.  I met my husband for lunch and we were both excited to try this place out.  Everywhere we have lived we have found a local bagel place that has had awesome breakfast and lunch sandwiches.  And I love love bagels.  So I was really expecting something great.  

Well we walked in and were slammed by the disgusting smell of the nail salon next door.  The whole little shopping center is indoors but the stores themselves are open-air, if that makes sense.  The place next door to Owen's is a nail salon, who does that?!  The last thing I want to smell is chemicals while I'm eating lunch...well maybe dog poo would be worse.  Anyways, the menu looks great, we place our orders, and they are out of almost every bagel.  It was noon and I thought that lunch would be a major deal there and they would have plenty of bread for the only thing they are serving.  So the sandwiches take forever and we go to pay and I order us each a combo with potato salad and a drink.  This is what the guy at the register says \"We don't have that.\"  And then nothing else and just stares at me.  Umm ok so I ask \"Why is it on your menu?\"  He looks at me with the most dumb and confused look on his face.  He picks up a menu and looks at it.  Then he says that they have new owners now and this menu is from the old owners.  Well make some new menus dummy!  They are obviously homemade and could be done in 10 minutes.  And how can you not know what's on your menu?!?  Then I ask what they have for sides and he looks in the display case and says \"We have hummus, chicken salad, and tuna salad.\"  WHAT?!  Jeez this is weird.  I ask \"Those are your sides??\"  I guess it finally clicks in his head what I'm looking for and says they have chips.  Ok I'll take chips, just get me outta here, I'm getting a headache from the nail polish fumes.  To top it all off, the sandwiches were just ok.  I am not a fan of steaming the bagels.  I like when they are crispy outside and chewy inside, the epitome of a bagel in my opinion.  These were just straight chewy.  And I'm pretty sure the place was not very clean.  The girl making the sandwiches was barehanded and answering the phone in the middle of her sandwich making.  Nasty.  

I'm sorry for the rant but thank you for listening.  I hope this place can turn it around but it's going to take a lot to get me to go back here for lunch.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while but love their bagels! It's definitely something that us Charlotteans are not used to... what a bagel steamed and made into a sandwich? The melty amazing gooeyness of the cheese on their bagels just makes you want to come back for more. We are so used to Einstein and Brueggers bagels down here. Don't get me wrong I'm fine with a bagel and cream cheese but Owens is different! It's in it's own category for bagels. Also, it's not a franchise, yet.  I remember coming here a few years ago when they first opened their doors and saw \"If\" by Rudyard Kipling written from top to bottom on one of the walls it brought back memories of my childhood and having to memorize that poem.  Overall great place for breakfast or lunch and close to uptown Charlotte right in South end."}
{"text":"Best NY bagels down south! They actually ship their bagels from NY and bake them in their restaurant. Besides their delicious bagels, they sell this AMAZING brand of cold brew coffee, called Pure Intensions.  The coffee is locally brewed and packaged, and is only available at a few stores/restaurants besides Owen's Bagels.  Great food, drinks and service!!! This place is the locals favorite:)"}
{"text":"Expect a line out the door on Saturday and Sunday mornings, but well worth the wait!

Awesome coffee and amazing bagels! Great staff

I always get the Phish.

Love this place!"}
{"text":"I popped into Owen's after leaving a \"retro diner\" that had horrible service and I never received my meal (Mattie's, check your staff). This was a setup for Owen's to some degree. If the service was bad, I was already PO'd so I'd probably take it out on them. However, if the service was good, the contrast would make them look like they served manna from heaven. Well, here is how it went... great! First off, the place is sorta weird and unconventional... a big plus for me. The menu was varied and options a plenty.  In addiation, they use Boar's head products, so I know they care. Placed the order after a short wait, and recieved it in about five minutes. Everything was yummy and we were happy campers. Rita's BLT gets a thumbs up and my sesame seed, egg and Colby bagel was a belly pleaser also.  Added bonus, people graffiti the walls with Sharpie pens. I exacted my revenge toward the retro dump . . . killed two birds with one stone ( and two bagels)."}
{"text":"Wish I could echo everyone else's positive experience, but it was just OK for us.  Maybe they were having an off day, but everything seemed kind of bland.  The bagels, the cream cheese, the butter, even the coffee.  We were there in the morning and the bagels didn't taste very fresh.  Also not a huge fan of the way they sell their coffee- $2.50 for a giant cup + free refills.  I drink a small cup of coffee and would prefer to just pay for that.  It's also hard to ignore the strong smell coming from the nail place even when the nail place is closed.  Don't think I've met a bagel (from a bagel shop) that I didn't like, but today threw most of one away."}
{"text":"Best place to get breakfast in South End!"}
{"text":"Owens is a very good spot for bagels. It is: 

A) Local. 
B) Decorated with a hipster kind of vibe with drawings all over the space and random memorabilia all over the place. 
C) A ton of great and creative choices for bagels. You will find something on the menu with a funny name. 

There isn't a lot more to say other than it is very crowded on the weekends and for a good reason, it is delicious. It could definitely use more seating and better parking but whatever it is still worth it."}
{"text":"Sandwich and bagel were good. Annoying, however, to pay nearly $7 for a sandwich and a plain bagel only to see the guy walk out the back carrying three bags of store-bought bagels and dumping them into the bin. At least try to trick us into thinking they're fresh by bringing the bin to the back and dumping the bagels there. Again, the sandwich is good (I got the Wilford). But the bagels aren't fresh and they're just plain generic store bought so save yourself the money and just buy a bag of bagels for the half the price."}
{"text":"I've been to Owen's a handful of times since moving to South End last year. They've always had good bagels, but each time I left wanting a little more in terms of service. But not today.

I don't know what they've changed, but my experience today was top notch. They had at least 10 employees working behind the counter, they've installed a new ticket system with order numbers (much more efficient!), and the coffee was 100% stocked. I was even asked by two different employees how my day was going! They've definitely stepped service up and it shows. Thanks, Owen's!"}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich fail

I was excited to try the local privately owned bagel shop, but this place was was unbelievably unimpressive. They use pre-cooked eggs. Wtf?? Are you kidding me? I would go to dunkin if I wanted to eat a rubbery pre-cooked egg square. Local shops are supposed to be better than chains, right? How hard is it to cook an egg? Also, the coffee is served in styrofoam cups, and the steamed bagels have a cheap hotel breakfast consistency. It looks like I'll just have to go to the chain places as long as I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Does New York City know about Owen's?

Owen's is Charlotte's hidden gem. Seriously, it's almost impossible to find. If you're having trouble, go to Polished in South End. It's right across the hall inside the Pavilion.

Once you're inside, there are a variety of bagels, cream cheeses and sandwich options to choose from and, really, you can't go wrong, although I wish they cooked their eggs to order. If you can't decide, you can always get the \"lottery\" bagel. It's $6.50 for a bagel sandwich of the staff member's choice with chips and a fountain drink. I've never had a bad one yet!

A few insider tips...
First off, get your bagel steamed instead of toasted. I know, it's crazy, but it's AMAZING.
Second, at Owen's a bagel with everything on it isn't called an ET or an everything bagel, but a \"combo\" bagel.

One combo, steamed, with butter, please!"}
{"text":"I used Owen's just this week to bring bagels to my co-workers for a morning meeting.  My planning was not exactly perfect as I called at 8:01am and ordered 40 bagels for an 8:30am pickup.  Again- not my finest hour.    

To give you my backstory- I stop by Owen's any chance I can (time permitting) when I come uptown.  Nothing beats a bagel (\"Jake Deli Home\" personal favorite) and a hot cup of coffee (Snickerdoodle when they have it).  My experience has always been 5 star.  More often than not Pam is behind the counter and is friendly as can be.  But this morning I was ordering for 35 of my friends...and I gave them 29 minutes notice. (#queue the scary music.... dum....dum.....DUMMMMMMM!!!!!)

The lady who took my order (can't remember her name) never once gave me the cliche' answer of \"We need at least an hour's notice for an order of this size.\"  Instead she said \"No problem!  We'll have them ready at 8:30.\"  BOOM!!!

I arrived at 8:34 (traffic ya know) to find my bagels/spreads/flatware/napkins all boxed up and ready to go!  Did I already say BOOM?  Well try this one: #nailedit!

I was in my office and had everything set up before 9:00. The bagels were a big hit.  mAdPrOpS to Owen's!

If you've never been you need to give them a try.  The menu is classic and not something you'd find at a Panera or an Einstein's.  A non-commercial really, really, REALLY good place to eat!"}
{"text":"Awesome bagels. The only place I know that they can steam or toast your bagel. Great food. Last time I used their water machine, it tasted funny, so I never get drinks there, but the bagels are WONDERFUL"}
{"text":"There's a long line but it moves super quickly! Loved the bagel options and the deli is really fresh"}
{"text":"I don't think I have anything to say that hasn't been said about Owen's already, but this place is easily one of, if not my favorite breakfast place in Charlotte.

Great Bagels
Nice people
Free Wi-Fi

Not sure it gets much better.

Recommendation:  Hangover Helper on Sesame."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. Amazing food, good music, great vibes. Go to weekend spot. Great hangover remedy ."}
{"text":"Owen's is awesome.  About a 4.5, but it's local and interesting so it gets a round up!  It's a lot bigger inside than it looks from the outside and there is quite a selection of tasty bagel treats.  They have some really creative combinations that taste good too!  They have an option of toasted or steamed bagel.  My buddy asked what the steamed option meant and the server answered, \"It's steamed and delicious...versus toasted and delicious!\"

Good prices, great vibe, local flavor.  Bagel sandwiches are always better."}
{"text":"Was excited to find a local bagel shop with some personality.  25 minute ticket time for my toasted bagel with veggie cream cheese.  When I finally got it, there was plain cream cheese.  Asked to have if fixed.  The cashier was super nice and asked me if wanted to keep the messed up bagel since they were going to just throw it out anyways to make me a new one.  I declined his offer, and he gave me a new bagel very quickly.  Well I wished I had took him up on that offer because when I got my \"new\" toasted bagel it was very clear that they had just replaced the cream cheese.  The bagel was cold and slight hardened when I went to eat it.  Pretty disappointing overall, I really wanted to like these guys."}
{"text":"Re-writing my review for this place because of three main observations:

1. Owens is still just as awesome when I wrote my original review!! 
2. Ordered the Hangover Helper this past Sunday on the bagel it comes with, Onion. The onion is far superior than the wheat for this breakfast sandwich. Please ignore my last review and don't order it on Wheat. Live a little!
3. They serve Pure Intentions coffee which is locally roasted. It is freaking amazing. Make sure you get a cup!"}
{"text":"Great and creative menu- both in name and recipe. Love the controlled chaos that is the menu board and decor- don't so much love the chaos that is ordering and awkwardly trying to find a place to stand and wait for your food. But believe me- I'd awkwardly squish in with many strangers for Owens."}
{"text":"By far the best bagel place in Charlotte! I drive 35 minutes here just for a bagel. The Mary's Bubby Grubby and Mama C's Lox bagels are my two favorites. I usually get jalapeño cream cheese or the chive cream cheese on the Mama C's Lox bagel and it really adds some delicious extra flavor to it. I add bacon to the Mary's Bubby Grubby bagel. Both are absolutely amazing and do not disappoint! Their menu is extensive for both breakfast bagels and lunch bagel sandwiches, so there truly is something for everyone. I would love to try more in the future, but I always have a hard time straying from my favorites! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a quality bagel with lots of bagel sandwich options. You can also get a rewards card if you go here a lot and earn a free bagel every 10 trips!"}
{"text":"delicious, absolutely delicious.  

i've only had the grubby bubby, twice, but it is damn good (egg, avocado, tomato and a HUGE slice of muenster on a fantasticly tasty bagel). the menu is huge and full of all sorts of delightful combinations to be wedged in between their top notch bagels.  i am going to try as many as i can when i can.  the atmosphere is cool, but the menu on strings behind the counter is very hard to read when it's your first time in there and you're conciousness is \"elevated.\" 

love the place, def recommend it to out of towners that want some unique QC flavor."}
{"text":"Any New Yorker will agree this is the place for an amazing bagel sandwich. You can't go wrong with any of their options.!"}
{"text":"Good bagels and variety. Prices are fair and decor is simple but fun (writing all over walls). My complaint would be the eggs and bacon. Unfortunately the eggs and bacon aren't made fresh and taste the same as fast food eggs and bacon."}
{"text":"I love Owen's. I have been going here for 6 years. The steamed bagels are among the best bagel sandwiches in Charlotte. Perfect for brunch or lunch. The staff are very friendly. Located in the pavilion, parking can be tricky. I usually park on the street behind the pavilion. Drink, chips and sandwich will run you $8 or $9. I usually stick with the Paul Ruben."}
{"text":"The most heavenly bagel in the world - no matter what you put inside to fill it, it'll always taste good here at Owens! I only want to eat steamed bagels from now on."}
{"text":"Excellent bagel sandwich...so many menu items to chose from, and the quality is delicious. Funky space, good service, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that I lived right down the road from Owen's for a year and a half and just discovered this little gem a few weeks ago.  This place is awesome!  The selection of bagel sandwiches is seemingly infinite.  There is truly something for everyone, whether you like veggies, BBQ, breakfast, or good ole lox and cream cheese.  Trying to pick just one can be overwhelming, but just stick to what you like and you will be good to go.  They have an enormous selection of hot teas and various other beverages, and they also have a cold case filled with deli salads and the like.  Super reasonably priced, amazing homemade bagels, totally chill atmosphere, and a friendly staff.  Can't ask for anything more in a neighborhood deli!"}
{"text":"These steamed bagels are where it is at.  Get anything with bacon and I promise you won't be disappointed. Love how the walls are decorated with poems, promises, and manifestos of all sorts. To boot, Jeff Owens is a great guy, the kind you want to give business to... I was only in town for 10 days, and came here twice, so that should tell you something!

Yum. Yum. Yum."}
{"text":"Couldn't be happier.  First time there and they treated me like family.  We had a great time!  delicious one of a kind bagels in a eccentric colorful setting."}
{"text":"Went for the first time, wasn't sure what to get. I honestly don't remember what I got but the amount of turkey and how delicious it was, was great! Will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"It was fine but might go back again. I think I'm just wasn't expecting my sandwich to come out hot. It was roast beef sandwich. I might stop by if in the area but wouldn't go out of my way... basically what all my 3 stars entail."}
{"text":"The dining area was scary and smelled disgusting due to the open walled nail salon nearby.  The sandwich was amazing.  After having a seat I noticed a steady stream of pick-up orders.  This seems like the best way to go."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great. The coffee... meh. It can get super busy on weekend mornings but the staff handles it well. And they play some pretty good tunes."}
{"text":"This was my go-to breakfast / bagel place in Charlotte. The first time one of my friends brought me here, I was pretty skeptical based on the exterior, but once I tried the Grubby Bubby I was hooked. I almost always got the Grubby Bubby with veggie cream cheese and it always hit the spot. I had never had a bagel steamed before Owen's and now I wish I could steam every bagel I eat. Lunch sandwiches are also good here; I always tried to pick a random one from the string of construction-paper sandwiches hung above the counter."}
{"text":"Best bagel place I've ever been to but if I'm being honest, I don't really eat too many bagels. With that being said, if I did I would head to Owen's every single time. It is so delicious. There are lots of options so there's something for everyone and even if you're not into all the creative flavors you can still get a plain bagel with cream cheese. The trick is that they steam their bagels which make them just soft enough. On this particular day we decided to get three bagels, the Phish, Bob-B-Cue and the Lottery. The lottery is where you let the geniuses at Owen's make you up a bagel. I'm not even sure what was all on it but it was amazing. The Phish which is my favorite had bacon, onions, bacon ranch cream cheese, pepper jack cheese, tomato and avocado on a asiago bagel. The BBQ bagel looked good as well but I wasn't looking to see what was on it because the phish and lottery were taking all my attention. My friend said that his BBQ bagel was amazing. In conclusion, venture here and try these amazing concoctions. You won't be disappointed. Oh and try to get there early seeing as how they fill up pretty quickly and it's hard to find seating. Other option is just call ahead and then pick up. Take your bagel sandwich home and devour it because I know you are."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch on Sunday. I had the bagel and lox, which was amazing. He had corned beef, which he says was so good he wants to go back for breakfast tomorrow. I quickly agreed, two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I step into Owen's after driving by twice and parking around back by the greenhouse. I shoulda read Todd's review and I would have had better luck! The interior is funky cool and makes you think local! 
I went with an everything bagel with turkey, egg,sprouts and avocado and a cup of joe. The coffee was average, so I figure the bagel was going to be awesome! My first bite into the bagel was nice but a bite of everything together made me wanting more, a lot more. The sprouts were a bit on the old side and turkey didnt make me think Boars Head. I searched out some hot sauce (packets) and that helped a little. I wish they had a few bottles of Red Hot or something instead of the tiny packets. 

I hope my third visit will be the charm!"}
{"text":"I visited twice during the first weekend of November 2017 after a close friend who lives in the area recommended Owen's Bagel & Deli to me; I was not disappointed! So delicious!! They had such a large variety of bagels and bagel sandwiches available, although I will admit that I got the same Asiago cheese bagel sandwich both times that I went. Service was great, received food in a timely manner, and it was a lively atmosphere.

Only complaints are the fact that there's limited parking since it shares a small lot with other businesses in the building and the strip club next door, and then also that it's located in a building with free-standing and partition walls that don't reach the ceiling so the bagel shop smells strongly of the nail salon next door. Because of this, I fee like it's better for a grab and go kind of thing."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I'm from Massachusetts and they don't quite have bagels figured out down here yet but this place does. It's very hipster-ish but s cool little place, food and coffee is great. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for breakfast in south end."}
{"text":"Hit or miss - Sometimes there bagles are fresh and sometimes not so much!!


If your looking for a good ambiance it's not here. It's usually really packed with people.  Writting on the walls.  Strange Decore !


On my first Visit here..
1) got my order wrong
2) fixed it, but had a little taste of something from the counter.. Yuck. But, I was starving so I ate it.

I purchased a toasted plain bagel with light melted butter and Munster melted on the top, open faced. 

Bagel itself was pretty good."}
{"text":"The Grubby Bubby on everything bagel is great, loaded with avocado, tomato, cheese and egg. I ordered it with jalapeño cream cheese, which definitely would have amped the flavor and made it even better, but it was forgotten. 

Speaking of which, the ordering protocol seemed a bit haphazard. The lady making the sandwiches motioned me over and asked what I wanted while she continued to make other orders. Nothing was written down or entered into a computer, which is likely why the above mentioned jalapeño cream cheese was forgotten. 

I also tried the blueberry bagel with cream cheese and cinnamon sugar so I could get a glimpse of their sweeter offerings. This one I could do without. Nothing special or different than any other bagel shop. 

However, the texture of the grubby bubby \"steamed\" bagel was amazing. I think it must be toasted prior to the steaming, which results in a slight crispy, slightly chewy hot sandwich where even the insides are heated through. Absolutely delicious, and I WILL be back for more."}
{"text":"Certainly a unique experience.  With the helpful staff to guide me on my first adventure into the Owen's bagel way of life, it was a very pleasant experience.  It was some tasty stuff, the onion bagel sandwich I had was amazing, once I got used to it anyway.  The difference in cooking methods made it taste slightly different from other bagels I've had.  But it was all good, I can see why they've been around for so long."}
{"text":"I have heard lots about Owen's bagel and I tried the Mary's Grubby Bubby. Pros was the avocado and egg combo is delightful. The bialy bread was okay, but I'm a former New Yorker so I have high standards. I think the tomato was too chewy and watery, I would leave it off. The overall effects of the sandwich were good but not great like the hype I've heard. The dough was a little tough to chew. I would say my other fave bagel place in CLT-- Manhattan Bagel has better quality dough and more bagels like my foodie experiences in NYC."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places. It's local and it cool. What more do you need? Located next to Leather & Lace and across from Icehouse and Atherton Market, this bagel joint is good for all ages. The \"named\" sandwiches are good for a good laugh and make the entire menu worth reading. Bagels are steamed and made to order on your bagel flavor of choice, though many are set for you for ease with the specific menu item.

When you make your way into the place, make sure you go to the counter away from the cashier and order at the counter by the people making the bagels. There's usually a line and just make sure not to skip. Once you've ordered, move over to the register and get a drink/coffee if you desire. Then you wait...about 3-4 minutes while they prepare your food. They'll call out the bagel, not your name, so be alert :)

My favorite is a unique order....Mr. Turkey, no lettuce, add egg on wheat. It's funny now, since I've been there a few times, the minute I say no lettuce, they finish with \"add egg on wheat\". Guess I come here often...ha. Great weekend morning place to chill with an inexpensive breakfast. They have a nice patio area too, so make sure you check that out too!"}
{"text":"Owens, I love you. I love your delicious bagels. I love all of your options. I love your staff, coffee, and coffee cake. 

Now for the bagel options. Booty bagel, you delicious peanut butter, honey, banana, thing, you - why are you so good? I literally have this bagel (and another for my real order) every single time I go. Do yourself a favor, try it. 

After that I always make so makeshift bagel or choose from their many options. You literally cannot go wrong. Also, try their coffee cake - yum! 

Not only are the bagels delicious but Owens is just fun to walk into. There is writing all over the walls and it just can't help but make you smile. If you're looking for a quick, delicious breakfast, look no further than Owens. Walk on hungry, walk out with a smile."}
{"text":"I have been to this place numerous times with it being right were I get my pedicures and around the corner from work, but last time I was in I had a \"Bad Bagel\"!! 

I had opted for the tuna fish with Pepper-jack cheese....I brought it back to my office and the tuna was just old or something it had a fishy taste to it and was pretty dry. In the past I have had the ham and cheese and that was really good on an Asiago Bagel!! I just love how the bagel sticks to the roof of my mouth like fresh white bread does!! 

The service has always been friendly and prompt guess I had gone in on an off day!!"}
{"text":"Delicious bagels, avoid the fountain machine.   Tastes like they don't clean the lines.  Best bagel place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Super delish bagels and the best thing to eat after a sad Bowl lost. Long lines are always good. Endless options for all and I ended up with the Gwacka Flacka Flame! They are steamed bagels it had turkey, lettuce, tomato, guacamole, and Siracha. I definitely recommend this place as it looked like both locals and visitors alike love it. Staff was awesome! They have ice coffee on tap.  I wish there was a shop in Nashville because I would be there."}
{"text":"Very cool spot.  Went at 11am last Sunday.  They had the music cranked and it was packed.  They move through the line quickly.  Got a ham, egg, and cheese on everything bagel.  This thing was awesome.  I cannot wait to go back and try more items."}
{"text":"My favorite bagel shop in the QC! Unique combos, fun atmosphere, quick service. And the bagels are delish. Definitely make sure you come here!"}
{"text":"Owen's Bagels is the exact right atmosphere for anyone who likes feeling that they're in a hip lesbian coffee shop from the 90s. I consider this a very high compliment. The space is colorful and warm and the bagel sandwiches are AMAZING. You go, Owen's Bagels."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! 

The owner is awesome you can make ur sandwhich anyway u want and even write down ur own sandwhich creation and add it to there floating menu list!! If ur sandwhich is a hit they will print it on the next menu!

I got the dreadlock but swapped the bacon for tuna.. Yum :-)"}
{"text":"Having a neighborhood go-to breakfast/deli is a must and I think this place just be some my go-to.

I have lived in this city for 9 months now and cannot believe it took that long to discover this gem. Owens is tucked away inside the pavilion in south end with somewhat limited parking options. 

The inside is very casually. Writing, scribbles, graffiti, hieroglyphics, and artwork adorns the walls along with stickers, college pendants, and signs with what I imagine to be regular customer's special orders.

The bagels are all fresh daily and the steam the sandwiches. I highly recommend the bialy. They are small but unique, flavorful and delicious.

The menu is humongous...overwhelming really. In addition to that, their are individually created variations mounted above the deli counter. It's usually busy and I always find myself rushing to figure out what I want. My first visit I was hurried into ordering and settled on the Mary's grubby bubbly. It was on the small size because of the bagel, but superb.

On the second visit I had a custom creation of sprouts, bacon, mayo, provolone, lettuce, and avocado on an everything bagel and was equally impressed.

I am so incredibly excited to have found this place and am sure I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Can't believe this was my first time at Owens! It's been on my bucket list for soo long. I opted to stop in here for a road trip for some carb fuel. I went with the Mary's Grubby Bubby - egg, cheese, avocado, tomato on a biali, which is a skinny bagel baked with caramelized onions. It was delicious, you should definitely not skip this one! Everything you'd want in a bagel sandwich, and extra cheesy!"}
{"text":"Friendly & helpful staff. Delicious tasting bagel sandwiches and wraps for meat eaters and non meat eaters alike"}
{"text":"I see why this place is a local favorite! 

I stopped in for an early lunch and had the whole place to myself! Whoop! Whoop! 

My first impression was fantastic. Everyone was so friendly! I guess I had a confused look on my face so they asked if it was my first visit, I said yes and they were very excited and made a few suggestions. I took them up on the special of the day. 

On Wednesday's it's \"A nice piece of Ash\" - love the name...probably because I had fun saying it. 

But I loved the sandwich even more. It has all of my favorites (turkey, cream cheese, veggies and bacon) on an everything bagel. 

My sandwich was ready in no time! And I'll admit that this was my first experience with a steamed bagel. I didn't really know what to expect. Would it be soggy? Would I be able to taste all the flavors I love in my everything bagel? 

Thankfully, it wasn't a soggy mess and I loved how all the flavors blended together! Nice job Owen's...THIS is how you spice up an ordinary turkey bagel sandwich. 

So far it's my favorite. Ok, I know...I haven't tried anything else. I'm a bit bias. But I know if I went again I'd order this without hesitation! So that's always a good thing. I definitely want to try out their breakfast too. 

See you guys very soon!"}
{"text":"what an awesome spot. from the super-big menu to the great atmosphere/environment, I was definitely impressed.

It took me a while to check this place out because, being gluten free, I wasn't really sure if there was any options available to me...BUT THERE ARE!

they offer 2 GF bagels, one plain and one everything.

when my boyfriend brought over my bagel, he had told me that the line had actually changed gloves, cutting board, and knife. I didn't have it toasted due to cross contamination but was definitely impressed by the above-and-beyond steps.

disclaimer: we went on a monday around 9 a.m. after flywheel...you now gotta refuel!...and it wasn't very busy. it has been told to me by the boy, that if you arrive past 9 a.m. on weekends, be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Had to post, obviously, about the best bagels in Charlotte. I have been coming to Owens to enjoy their fresh, steamed delicious bagels since 2004/2005 when they first opened. As bagels are my one food I could eat every day for the rest of my life and never get sick of them, I have high standards. And Owen's has literally never disappointed (except for that time when someone decided to run their car into the building and they were closed for a devastating amount of time. But that's not the bagels' fault). 

ANYWAY I placed my low carb diet on hold yesterday for lunch (to kick off Thanksgiving week, duh) and again- did not disappoint. 

I have been getting Kool Jules as my go-to deli sandwich. For a time, it was off the menu but they would make it for me anyway, and eventually it ended up back on the menu. I like mine with cucumbers instead of sprouts- definitely a good decision. A couple other good ones I've had are the Tonya Harding Club and the BobEQue. My fav breakfast ones are the Sweet Caroline, the Banana Surprise and the traditional Breakfast bagel with sausage egg cheese and cream cheese. 


GO TO OWENS! THEY ARE CHANGING THE WORLD ONE BAGEL AT A TIME!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place. When my wife and I finally decided to head over and try it, I was surprised. The location is in prime south end, the building itself is very weird.  Some of the menu items sounded awesome ... some a little weirdly delicious, despite the pairings. 

We were just plain-jane's and got sausage, egg + cheese bagels. It's kind of hard to mess that up, so it was good. Nothing earth shattering. I will say, I would give a solid 5 stars to the asiago cheese bagel I had. That thing was outofthisworld. We did have about a bit of a wait for them to make it, so I wouldn't stop in here if you're in a rush to get in+out. It's no McDonald's breakfast. Definitely worth the try, especially if you're feeling randy for same variety."}
{"text":"Good food.  Ran out of the loaded grits today :(  place is pretty busy.  Ate here yesterday and was good so decided to come back today"}
{"text":"GREAT place! Bagels are excellent. 

Cool atmosphere but it is too cool...meaning they think it's ok to have you wait for 15 min for a bagel w cream cheese. 

Definitely check this place out though. worth the wait."}
{"text":"I knew I'd be down w Owens from the moment i walked in.. guess u could say the writing was on the wall!

i love their super creative selection of bagel and bialy sandwiches.. their food is very good, but the highly likable atmoshpere and great peeps running the join def sealed the 5th star for me.

I got the 'south end' w turkey, tomato, onion, spinach cream cheese on a bialy. yeah its a good as it sounds."}
{"text":"Had the basic breakfast bagel (sausage, egg and cheese... pepper jack, specifically) and it was ze bomb! Their sausage is an actual one cut thinly into perfection. It doesn't make you question the contents. I will have to keep coming back to try the other gazillion things on the menu- so many options that I had to go basic."}
{"text":"Reading the recent activity on YELP about Owen's, I had to find out for myself.  I went  today and had a bagel and a cup of coffee.  My coffee wasn't hot, it must have been the bottom of the press pot but for some reason, it didn't bother me and they still get 5 stars.  They were really nice, my bagel was served hot and delicious.  Their coffee is Larry's Beans, so Owen's is supporting a NC business, so we should support their NC business!!!  Right?  

Owen's takes pride in their food and it shows, they also serve Boars Head meats and you can go to Leather and Lace and get a lap dance afterwards, now that is full  service..

I will rate Owen's Bagel & Deli four corn dogs."}
{"text":"The original Bagel & Deli is in Oxford, Ohio on the campus of Miami University. The atmosphere isn't quite the same at Owen's as what we had in college, but the sandwiches are just as good. 

I read a few people complaining that the bagels are soft, or that the bagels aren't as good as New York's bagels, or even that it wasn't as good as advertised. But most of the complaints I saw were from people that weren't willing to try any of the signature sandwiches that put Bagel & Deli on the map back at Miami. These bagels aren't supposed to be hard, they are steamed so that everything melts together into a gooey delicious treat. 

For us, this was our late night and hangover food for four (or more) years. I would never have ordered a bacon egg and cheese and think I'm getting McDonald's or even Panera. That's not what it is, so if that's what you're looking for, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick bite to eat. Upon entering we grabbed a menu to decide what to eat. I had the nice piece of ash. I had seen it many times on Yelp so I decided to try it. It really is a great sandwich. The bagel is fresh and chewy. If you are from NYC and know anything about H&H bagels, they kind of remind me of those. 

As we sat there, I was intrigued by the writing on the wall. I just sat and read as many as possible. I'd love to come back and try some of their other sandwiches, or even just get one of those bagels with cream cheese.

The iced coffee is self-serve, WITH A WARNING! They have a camera fixed on you so you don't try to get free refills. The coffee was very good, I just wish the creamers were in a canister as opposed to the small individual creamers. I know...not a dealbreaker, just a personal preference."}
{"text":"What's not to love? Tucked inside the Pavilion in Southend, crazy art on the walls, banners, notes written in sharpie, mismatched chairs, rocking chairs, and an odd layout to boot. Needless to say, it's PERFECT. My kind of spot for a good breakfast or any time, for that matter. It's like a Common Market met a grungy record shop and then decided to focus on bagels. I just love this place. 

Parking can feel a bit odd since there aren't many spaces out front and it's so close to South Blvd. I'd park where ever you can find an open space. 

The menu is extensive with tons of crazy concoctions. There are plenty of more breakfast-style choices but tons that will appeal to the lunch bunch as well. My favorite for an anytime or good breakfast -- Mary's Grubby Bubby. Tomato, avocado, egg, and muenster. I was stoked to see they had some bialy left, too! Tried it on for size and it was amazing. I love making bialy at home and Owen's really hit the spot. 

Though I didn't grab a cup of coffee with my breakfast, the roaster they use out of Raleigh had bottles of cold brew in the cooler. Love trying new cold brews and loved that Owen's had this for sale. Picked up a bottle on the way out. 

The service is great. Homeboy was nice and took care of like 6 people after I ordered mine. That guy had some hustle, too. He then came out and took care of the entire room while everyone was eating. One man teams like that are hard to come by. My hat's off to you, my friend. 

Owen's is numero uno if I'm ever in Southend and craving a bagel. Next up, I'm going for something a little heartier! Can't wait to come back again. It had been too long since my first. Thanks, Owen's!"}
{"text":"Solid spot with really good bagels. I had sausage egg and cheese sandwich which was really good. Not much of a spot for craft coffee but the cold brew was ok. Overall i would go back, it was in a convenient spot in south end and well priced."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! Awesome unique bagel sandwich. Steamed who would of thought of this?? So good ! Go get you some !"}
{"text":"You guys!  This place is a hidden gem. It's never too busy, which is a great thing,  but i hope they're generating enough income to keep in business.  So go!  You can get breakfast for lunch.  It's a good find."}
{"text":"Great bagel sandwiches for great prices.  They have funny names for all of their specials.  The Tanya Harding is yummy."}
{"text":"Owens is the best breakfast sandwich in town. I had been told I needed to check it out but procrastinated for a year. I wish I hadn't. 

The bagels are amazing and there are options for just about anyone. They tend to get busy on a weekend around lunch time but it's worth the wait. 

After a night out, there's nothing better than throwing on some clothes and rolling into Owen's (it's often obvious many others have done the same). 

The bagels and toppings taste fresh with I have found is rare for a bagel/breakfast sandwich place in this area. 

I would recommend possibly going earlier in be morning or later in the afternoon if going on the weekend unless you want to wait. They simply can't handle the amount of people they get at lunch time to make it move any faster (and that is not there fault at all, it's just the sheer number of people ordering)."}
{"text":"The best bagels you can find in Charlotte right next to a strip club...need I say more?"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick breakfast in South End. However, the bagel was too soft and pork roll was so thin it was pretty much just bacon but this is coming from a New Jerseyan used to her bagels a certain way. The sandwich as a whole was delicious. Ooey gooey and cheesy. The jalapeño cream cheese was amazinggg, best part of the sandwich. My boyfriend got the sundried tomato cream cheese and he said it over powered the rest of the sandwich so maybe only get that if you're just getting a regular bagel. I would go back and recommend that others give it a try!"}
{"text":"Just like Pat's steaks... but with bagels... and in Charlotte...

I want to start this out with my favorite part of Owens- their service. I got up here just as they were opening their doors on a Saturday to see a line formed outside. Of course at first I didn't have a good feeling about waiting. Usually when you see a line out the door of any place in the south you better clear your schedule for the rest of the day. But I was told this was pretty normal operation here for a Saturday morning, so I figured I'd stick it out. Thankfully the line moved quick. Once inside and ready to give my order, I was hit with that classic \"quick jab\" ordering convo that had been keeping the line moving. Love it. So similarly to an order at Pat's, I also limited myself to just three responses- \"Mama C. Everything bagel. Regular cc.\" Paid, and stepped aside. Painless. So painless. And the order was out just as quick as waiting in the line. That, my friends, is how it's done.

As for a VERY close second- their food. These bagels are FRESH and the sandwich combo's are fantastic. You cannot leave here without finding one of their menu items to become your new breakfast addiction. My Mama C- which was lox sandwich on an everything bagel with all the trimmings- was about one of about a dozen others I was on the fence with. (Just means I'll have to be back another eleven times I guess!) And don't think they are only limited to breakfast-type sandwiches either, they definitely have all kinds. 

The atmosphere of this place deceives you into thinking you've strolled into the Noda neighborhood temporarily. 

There can definitely be some limited seating on a Saturday."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Owens since before I actually moved to Charlotte, so I figure a review is long overdue. Owens is my go-to spot for breakfast bagels for their creative menu, delicious sandwiches, and unique vibe.

Walking in for the first time can be a bit intimidating for a few reasons including the long line and expansive menu. I have no idea who put together their original menu, but it's worth a short read for entertainment. If you can't find something that grabs you, then you can't go wrong with making your own. I often lean on bacon, egg, cheddar with avacado. Hangover helper is a solid backup (and yes, it does help). 

I do like that they steam their bagels, which seems to meld the flavors together better than toasting. Be careful though, as the bagels are around 1 million degrees when you first get them. Also be sure to check out their strong coffee game that features local roasters and now cold brew on tap."}
{"text":"For my fellow Jews out there who have been hard pressed on finding a good ol' bagel and lox and some Dr. Browns soda in Charlotte, Owens may just do it for you. Having just moved from Boca Raton, FL, where aside from New York is the land of the Jewish Deli, I've been yearning to find the equivalent here in Charlotte. Not realizing that outside of my Jewish Deli bubble it was going to be very hard to satisfy my craving, I finally stumbled upon Owens and I am blissfully satisfied. 

  I wish i would have asked her name but a very sweet woman told me all about the place after I told her that it was my first time there and so I ordered my onion bagel with lox(nova)cream cheese onion and tomato. I was verrrry happy to finally find a place that resembled something like home.

   It's a very unique looking little place. Hand drawn menus hanging up, that are very funny and writings all over the wall which is pretty darn cool. They have some organic options as well as supporting local vendors which is AWESOME! So if you haven't tried it yet, Just do it!! I will be coming back when I have my bagel and lox cravings (which happens often)."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!!

It's located inside a shopping center, and if you blink you just might miss it! I visited today between classes, and the menu made everything sound so great I couldn't decide and ordered two different bagels: the booty bagel and an onion bagel with house-made veggie cream cheese. The shop is an open warehouse type set up; customers are allowed to leave their mark/artwork/name on any wall with space and there is plenty of seating and workspace available.

[The Booty Bagel] Cinnamon raisin bagel with peanut butter, banana and honey; perfection from start to finish. How could this taste bad?
[Onion with Veggie CC] The bagel could have had more onion sprinkled on top, but I say that as a die-hard onion fan. The cream cheese was great! Reminded me of the garden veggie CC at most other bagel shops. 

*I also got a free fountain drink coupon just for checking in on Yelp! so thats always a good deal."}
{"text":"A great little find. Magic bagel sandwiches.

This little deli spot is located inside a space with other businesses and is funky and fresh! They have all these cool bagel sandwiches with names like The Tonya Harding and the Federline!  They do this steaming thing that seems to make the sandwiches magical. I really liked the Southend - yummy little cucumber salad too - lots of seating in a very artsy/picnic style space.

Casual, quick, affordable lunch spot."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good stuff. The bagels were fresh and perfectly chewy, the toppings were plentiful. The cold brew coffee had me buzzing for hours. All wonderful things for a simple brunch. 

The bad - Holy crap, this place is loud! If you want club level music with your brunch, this is the place for you. This was definitely a turn off for me and my husband. Of course, we feel very old for admitting this. 

There was quite a long line when we arrived, but it moves fairly quickly. We definitely waited a long time for our food once the order was in, though."}
{"text":"My original plan was to go to Einstein Bagel.  After circling the parking lot a couple of times and getting a spot snagged from me twice, I remembered seeing a place called Owen's just slightly further down South Blvd.  

There was plenty of parking around back and I was immediately in a better mood.  I absolutely loved the vibe in there (not to mention I was almost lured in to Polished to get my nails and toes DID). 

There was SO much to pick from on the menu and I was borderlining *hangry* so I figured I'd stick to something quick and easy and ordered a ham, egg and cheese and grabbed an OJ.  While waiting for my food (which wasn't long) I walked through the shop reading all of the fun things that customer's have written on the walls. It took me right down memory lane since as a child my Mom allowed my friends and I to use one room in my wall as a drawing board (crazy, right?)

The staff was nice, service quick and once I got home and inhaled my ham, egg and cheese I considered going back for another.  I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years! It's delicious, and you can't find a steamed bagel anywhere else in Charlotte. Love Owen's!!"}
{"text":"My \"new\" husband and I went to Owen's for brunch the day after our wedding. I absolutely loved my bagel and got a few bites of Joe's that were fantastic as well. I love the location, the staff, the funky decorations, and the music they play in the joint. It is definitely worth giving a try... from this point forward I will drive past the major bagel chain on South Blvd. that I've been known to frequent to support this awesomely delicious local restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places in all of Charlotte. Owen's has tons of funky bagel combinations and is a great place for breakfast or lunch. The atmosphere is also funky and unique. The only downfall to this place is the wait time. I have been a few times when it was not crowded yet had to wait 15+ minutes for my food.

Also, try the cold brew coffee it's great!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  I believe what I had was called smack that ash.  It had ash in the name and it was amazing from the bacon ranch to the soft everything bagel.  The flavors were awesome and the bagel was not dry at all.  I will be going back.  Customer service was awesome as well"}
{"text":"If you like bagels, you will LOVE Owen's!  They sell cold brew coffee, too!

Now if only I could remember to make an appointment for a mani/pedi at the nail salon across the hall..."}
{"text":"Happiness is a warm bagel.

Owen's claim to fame is their bagel steaming process.  Before I came here, I had no idea what bagel steaming entailed, but it beats the heck out of toasting.  Bagels (and bagel sandwiches) go in the steamer as regular bagels.  A couple minutes later, they come out warm packets of chewey bagel goodness.  I especially recommend it for bagel sandwiches involving cheese. 

I ordered the Italian bagel sandwich -- a combination of ham, pepperoni, provelone and banana peppers on an onion bagel.  I subbed a plain bagel, since I hate onions, and the server was totally cool with the substitution.  After steaming, the bagel came out a cheesey warm chewey delight.  Think toasted Quiznos, but with better ingredients.

The wide range of menu items can be a little overwhelming if you're looking at the variety of posters suspended from the ceiling.  Your better bet is to grab a printed menu from the counter.

Perhaps the only thing better than a steamed bagel from this shop is a steamed cookie.  The cookies are generously sized and delicious as-is.  But if you can talk your server into popping a cookie into the steamer, it comes out chewey and melty like it was fresh from the oven.

Owen's bagel shop might be a little tough to find, but the bagels make it worth seeking out."}
{"text":"The weekend lines are long (and filled with some serious walk of shame outfits) but it's worth it - the bagel sandwiches are phenomenal. I change my order in my mind about 5 times while in line - all options are great"}
{"text":"Great tucked away bagel place. Huge menu, but well categorized so you can find what you'd like quickly.

Friendly Staff, Fun Atmosphere. 

Highly recommended if you are in the mood for a bagel. 

Hidden parking around back if you can't find a spot upfront."}
{"text":"Owen's bagel is solid.  Great coffee ( pure intentions ), great assortment of bagel sandwiches, and a decent price.  Everything came out quick and awesome.  Be prepared to listen for your number when they call it out or they will remind you what you ordered and that they don't have time for your bs ( i love this ).  What drops this place down is the steamed bagel.  I hate and love it at the same time.  The bagels look amazing and with steaming it makes them softer and a good choice for sandwiches.  The problem is I love bagels and it makes the bagels taste a little meh.  I def will be back as its a good spot to grab breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"First time trying and HOLY SMOKES is it good! I have been dying to try this place after hearing they had gluten free bagels! Got the basic bacon egg and cheese on a GF everything bagel. It was hot and made to order! Wishing I had gotten another (or two). Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really amazing bagels! NICE PIECE OF ASH is SOOOO GOOD!!! ¡Muy delicioso!
The music can be a little overwhelming, but fits the joint. The staff is always very nice and willing to recommend bagels!
Probably my favorite bagel joint in the CLT!!!"}
{"text":"Good eats and good peeps! The Reuben was awesome and the service was great. Better than the big chain bagel places for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice stop, funky interior. Takes a while to get a bagel, but that's the care going into making it that takes so long, right? They have an overwhelming menu, but it's a good thing...it all looks great! I've had a few bagel sandwiches and they've been really good and totally filling. 

They just partnered with Foodie Call so you can get a bagel wherever you are in the Queen City! 

There is free WiFi, a patio that gets direct sunlight (get a tan while you eat!), and plenty of seating indoors. Parking space is limited, so on a busy day plan to park on a neighborhood street and have a nice walk."}
{"text":"This place has some amazing looking and yummy bagel sandwiches. Our group had the Phish bagel, salmon bagel, and a chocolate one. They were all very good and I will definitely be back again for them. The coffee was not good however but they make up for it with the bagels."}
{"text":"Hot damn, this was the best bagel sandwich I've ever had. 

So I used to work at Bruegger's as a teen, and those are some good bagels: boiled up then baked for a crunchy outside and a nice chewy center. (I know it's a regional debate, but this is how bagels should be.)  I've eaten every kind of sandwich there is; my favorite is roast beef with jalapeno cream cheese loaded up with veggies, on a warm Everything bagel. 

I digress. My point is, I now have a new favorite: I got the Hangover (Ham, Egg & Smoked Cheddar) on an Everything bagel. Wow. I wanted everything on the menu (check it out, it's huge) but I had to pick one.

So they steam the bagels after the sandwich is all put together. Or maybe before? Who knows. What I do know is that it makes the bagel slightly soft. Now, I wouldn't think I would be into that, but as it turns out I LOVE IT. A regular bagel, even when freshly baked, has a stiffness to it that when you bite into it, causes all the fillings to smoosh and shoot out the other side (which means you have to eat it like a taco and keep taking bites from different ends). This is not the case with a steamed bagel sandwich! The bagel is just soft enough to give so that everything stays in place resulting in a PERFECT PROPORTION OF BAGEL TO FILLING. Genius.

So I don't live in Charlotte, sh*t!! Wanna franchise in Austin!? For now, I'll have to make a point to stop by every single time I visit. (By marrying my boyfriend I've guaranteed this can occur at least once a year. Yup, that was in the PRO column when I decided to marry him. Granted he did ask me only a few hours after we ate at Owen's. In fact, he later told me, when we were in line, he asked the Magic 8 Ball on the counter if he should pop the question. The answer: \"Without a doubt.\" Thanks, Owen's Magic 8 Ball :-)

My point? Go there. Get your bagel on. 

Oh, the staff is friendly, it's reasonably priced (if not cheap!!) and the  place is super  cute. Bring a Sharpie so you can leave your mark!"}
{"text":"Hey.  You.  Owen's is terrible.  Don't go there.








Not buying it, huh?  Well... I guess we couldn't keep it a secret forever. Owen's is hands down the best specialty bagel sandwich shop in Charlotte.  Listen, that's a big statement from me.  My family has been in the bagel business for over 50 years.  We owned one of the first bagel shops in New York and LA before Brueggar's and Einstein's came in and demolished everyone.  You want a good bagel in Charlotte?  Owen's or Poppy's.  That's it.

All you need to know is if you can dream it, Owen's can do it.

Fan Favorites:
* Grubby Bubby
* Booty Bagel on Blueberry

Personal Favorite:
* Bagel, Egg and Chive Cream Cheese (add salt and pepper) on Everything.

Other Important Notes:
Dogs are welcome, but not preferred inside the actual bagel shop.  You can write on the walls.  If you're going with two people, best to each get your own sandwhich and then share a Booty Bagel for dessert (Yes, I most certainly believe in breakfast dessert).

My only wish is that they had better coffee.  But for how good the bagels are, I'll drink it.

Cheers to the fat kids!"}
{"text":"Mama C's Lox are always a wonderful way to start the day. The staff is pleasant and quick even when there is a line out the door."}
{"text":"Their bagels sandwiches are SO good! A bit pricey though."}
{"text":"3 years ago I would have given Owen's 4, maybe even 5 stars.  These days I can only give it 2.  One reason is the young kids they have working in there who talk and text on their phones and than proceed to make sandwiches without washing their hands. Cell phones are dirtier than toilets.  Another reason is the price.  Most bagels are over $5 and they are not worth the price - with combos costing about $7.  I can get a good sized fresh made sub from Jersey Mike's, with chips and a drink for that price.  Sure the interior is funky and it's local and all of that stuff, but when products are overpriced and service isn't so good, I'd rather go somewhere else and get my moeny's worth."}
{"text":"Nice people, but very disorganized. The layout doesn't make sense. You get coffee, you go to the right, but you get food you go to the left.

They call out long numbers for your order and don't confirm what's it is. I got my sandwich and it was wrong. I had like 3 things and they don't give you a bag, so it was awkward carrying everything out.

It was a very discombobulated experience."}
{"text":"Have been going to Owen's for several years now and it is always a reliable bet. Mary's Grubby Bubby is my personal favorite. They used to have a lot of fun signs for the different bagel sandwiches, but those seem to have been consolidated to a different wall now. 

They've improved their ordering system over the years which makes it a whole lot easier to hear when your order is called (# rather than type of sandwich). The service is a little rough around the edges and seating is a bit sparse with the weekend hordes of 20-somethings coming in looking like they just finished yoga and/or a marathon. 

Will continue to keep coming here on occasion to support local business and decent quality food."}
{"text":"Woo! Best bagels in Charlotte hands down. So soft and delicious. I love the mix of bagel sandwiches they have, especially the vegetarian options. However, the classic egg, sausage and cheese is bomb and always a great pick. I recommend getting the everything or asiago bagel if you're getting a sandwich -Trust me.  

They also have a BYO option so if you don't find anything you like you can always do that. Plus, if you check-in you get a free soda. 

There is usually a line here, especially on the weekends, but they are pretty fast and the bagel is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is home of the steamed bagel.  All the bagels are steamed and wrapped in tin foil like a burrito (which is the easiest way to eat them).  The menu is full of delighful combinations, one of my favorite is the Sweet Thursday- cinnamon raisin bagel, egg, swiss cheese, and tomato, I know it sounds wierd but it's delicious.  The chicken salad is also pretty good.  The sandwiches are large but they aren't cheap- look for the special of the day."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I love this place. I'm vegan and he is a omnivore and we both leave happy... Awesome service every time. For vegans they have a ton of vegetables and vegan cream cheese!

Keywords: vegan breakfast, vegan lunch, vegan bagels, vegan brunch"}
{"text":"I really like Owen's and their food is always good, but the location and line always get me. They have a large selection and you can pretty much build any kind of bagel sandwich you want. The location is in a building where different businesses rent out spaces, but it's across the way from a nail salon so you get whiffs of the chemicals while you're eating. Yum. If you go during prime hours, be prepared for a line out the door and a wait. I don't go out of my way to go here, but I do like it when I'm in the Southend area."}
{"text":"Breakfast in bed bagel? Enough said, go get IT! Sweetness with a mix of southern breakfast taste all-in-one."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Nice to have a local bagel shop. A lotylr expensive but good quality food."}
{"text":"If you're going to get a bagel, seek no further. After being introduced a few months ago to Owen's Bagels, I've been an avid repeat customer. It has a relaxed vibe, with graffiti all over the brightly colored walls, and \"thank you\" notes from locals schools.
I love the menu. It offers a huge variety from vegetarian to crazy bagel breakfast sandwich options. Coming from NYC, I sought out a good bagelry for those Sunday or hangover mornings and I need to seek no further. Try the Lottery Bagel...it's the staff's choice combination of a sandwich. I guarantee you'll never be disappointed."}
{"text":"Most importantly the bagels are great. Shared the Mamas Lox and the Booty Bagel and enjoyed both. The only reason I am giving this place three instead of four stars is because the weekend morning crowd is clearly huge. Please push those tables in the waiting area to the side or remove them until post rush. It would not be difficult, and it would really help with maneuvering space as you are waiting. And mics would help to hear over the (great!) music. Again. Food is great. And that's really the most important part. But space during busy times would help the overall experience."}
{"text":"The bagels are good, however, they're not the best I've ever had. My sister's order came out missing two of the ingredients, the cheese and the avocado. The staff here is honestly the best though, which is a big reason for the four stars. Friendly, helpful, and genuine people who care about their customers!! I walked in and immediately felt welcomed with their hearty greetings and smiles. Great vibes and decor!"}
{"text":"Yesterday before work I ran by Owens to get a bagel. They are one of the few bagel places I know of that carry vegan cream cheese so when I get a craving its nice to have them down the block from where I work. 

Unfortunately yesterday there was a mix up and they put veggie cream cheese (real cream cheese with veggie bits mixed in) on my bagel instead. I didn't notice until I got to work and opened up my bagel. Luckily a co-worker brought some cereal and I traded her my bagel. But still, bummer, plain cereal was far from the toasted bagel I wanted.

So today I went back before work because I was still craving that bagel. It was the same man at the register from yesterday and I politely asked to make sure it was vegan and not veggie. He recognized me and apologized and took care of the cost for my bagel today. As I waited I watched him go over and tell the cook to make sure the correct spread was on my bagel. Everyone was very friendly and eager to correct the mistake from yesterday. 

I wasn't expecting all they did. I work in the hospitality industry and I understand mix ups happen. I wasn't upset with them by any means and they still did everything they could to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"Everyone who works here is super friendly - there are so many options for carnivores, vegetarians, vegans + now even gf bagels! Definitely our go-to quick breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable...it is SO GOOD!!! The bagels are so fresh and can be steamed/toasted. The eggs are always so fresh as well as the meat. The avocado is always GREEN too, that is important. The staff is friendly and the service is quick. I always have a good experience here so matter what I order. Tons of options for every style eater!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this little Deli!!! They have a huge variety of sandwiches and NY Style Bagels...which is the absolute best!! You can mix and match, add, subtract whatever you want and it's all approved with a smile. The staff is great, the decor is so damn artsy you'll love the vibe. My one disappointment is that they close super early (3) but hey they are always busy so I can imagine they need the rest"}
{"text":"This is my fav bagel/weekend stop!! I used to live uptown/dilworth and just moved to Cary, NC. Everytime, I am back in the area---Owen's is a must. I love that they customize the sandwiches and it's just amazing every time. 
I love that they're so spunky and eclectic ...definitely a Charlotte staple."}
{"text":"First time here, and I didn't know what I wanted.  So I went with their Lottery Bagel, where they make one at random for you.  Chips and drink included for $7.50.

Listen, if I can get a random bagel sandwich and it turns out to be the best bagel sandwich I've ever had, that probably means I need to eat more bagel sandwiches.

But hey, you've gotta give credit where it's due.  This place is awesome.  I'll definitely be back for more bagel sandwiches."}
{"text":"Gotta get your bagel double steamed. Trust me. If the pimento cheese grits are still a special they are a must."}
{"text":"Went in today for the first time and I will say, my bagel was awesome. Mary Grubby Bubby: egg, cheese, tomato, avocado. YUM. SO YUM! Great breakfast/quick lunch. Service is whatever but what can can you expect from a cashier and a couple of people behind of a grill. I totally understand that with the vibe of the place it's not expected or necessary to have 100% over the top service. Anyway... I will go again soon and try another bagel and I'm very excited!"}
{"text":"Try number two - I got a message from Ashley, the owner, after my first review asking me to please give them another shot. I came in last week, weekday morning and they were dead. It was probably about 7:30am? When I walked in, the lady behind the desk was on her phone, but she greeted me. It took me a while to figure out what I wanted, but she was patient and kept checking in on me to see if I was ready. I eventually made a build your own - I told you in the last review that I'm a little bit of a bagel and egg snob. I asked for a *toasted* not steamed bagel, with bacon, egg whites, cheese and avocado. She didn't say much until she gave me my bagel - then she told me that it was going to be a good sandwich and called me honey. A glimmer of friendliness! Yay! The sandwich was good, she was right. Unfortunately, with my bagel, bottle of water and coffee the total was over $10. But it was good food. Avocado seemed fresh, egg whites were good. I'll probably be back for a bagel, but I'll have to figure out what I like on the menu. Maybe eventually I'll get into the steamed thing? Yelpers, maybe we could all go and get some bagels. :)"}
{"text":"Well I finally got to try Owen's yesterday and I have to say it was pretty good. I'm usually in this area whenever I go to the dentist or get my hair done and failed to realize how close it was to both of those places for me!! Owen's is tucked away in the same strip as the Polished nail salon - right across the street from Atherton. All this time and I never paid attention!

I got to Owen's around 9:45 on a Saturday morning and was expecting to be met with a long line but thankfully it was not the case. I placed my order for a standard bacon & egg (no cheese please!) on an everything, a plain bagel (not toasted, only sliced), and coffee. For those three items, my total came to $9.36 which I found slightly ridiculous but whatevs. For the price, I didn't like the fact that there's only two coffee choices - decaf or regular. No flavored coffees to choose from but there's a slew of flavored creamers and half and half cups and sugars.

Once you place your order, you move over to the side to wait until your number is called out. Even though there was a good amount of people working behind the counter and not too busy, myself and others still had to wait a bit for our orders to be called. As I waited, I saw that they started to get busier and the line to place an order was getting longer. Once my number was called, I was very hungry and eager to jump right into my sandwich. I could feel the heat from the sandwich through the bag. And that sucker was HOT! like fresh out of the steamer hot. The bagel was nice and chewy but the everything bagel flavor was very underwhelming.

I'm looking forward to going back and trying one of their signature sandwich creations just so I can really get a taste of an authentic Owen's bagel sandwich experience."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for breakfast or lunch in SouthEnd. Their bagel sandwiches are excellent and the bagels themselves are very soft, just the right texture. Lots of different combinations of sandwiches. I get the hangover helper with egg, cheese, and ham with a drink for $6. The place has a funky vibe to it and there are only a handful of tables but it is never packed. Only thing keeping it from 5* is that the bagel sandwiches range from $6-$8 without a side or drink so it is a little pricey for what you get. But the taste is great!"}
{"text":"Cashier was hard of hearing.  Wife asked for egg fried hard twice and got a runny yolk which she cannot eat (texture is a major put off) but she stomached anyway.  Asked if the pimento cheese grits came as a side and the cashier just looked at her.  Perhaps they should turn the music down?  My pizza bagel is listed on the menu on an onion bagel, but came out plain (not requested).  Sauce was plain tomato paste with no seasoning and cold pepperoni.  Overall food was over-priced, particularly given the service and quality.  Would not eat there again."}
{"text":"Very unique variety of food! I got a bagel sandwich that has Doritos on it and it was awesome to be able to try something new and unique that was extremely tasty. This place is so great that there's is often a wait but they move quickly and efficiently. Great value for the price you pay!"}
{"text":"Amazing warm and fresh bagels and fantastic front line service crew! Way to go Owen's Bagel & Deli!!"}
{"text":"Bagels are well steamed and ingredients of the sandwiches tasty, but in the middle of June, what's up with these translucent tomatoes?  Isn't there a farmer's market across the street?"}
{"text":"I love Owens and I'm so pumped that they have reopened! Great for either breakfast or lunch, this place has got delicious bagels that can be prepared by toasting or steaming them and unbelievable coffee. My standard- a steamed blueberry bagel with cream cheese and a coffee = heavenly mornings. Set up your laptop to power through some work or set up a meeting here! It's the perfect meet up place that's centrally located in South End!"}
{"text":"It was crowded. But man, the vibe here is great. Awesome funky bagel styles. Cool little artsy visual menu. Cool interior and great staff."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday and I will definitely be back.  I had the Mary's Grubby Bubby and it was awesome...melty cheese, avocado, egg, yum!  Better than the food is the service.  I had gotten the wrong bagel and got home to realize that I had...I went back and the owner herself (Ashley) refunded my money and got me the correct sandwich in no time!  If you're a sucker for hot bagel sandwiches, you must try it.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast and weekend lunch places in Charlotte.
If you haven't been before, it is is a little hard to find as it is in the interior of a tiny little strip mall.
They have a delicious array of bagels as is. But what they do with those bagels makes this place noteworthy. It is not a unique concept but they seem to be the only place in Charlotte that has really taken bagel sandwiches to the next level.
Offering about 50 bagel sandwich varieties plus the ability to make custom sandwiches or just have a bagel with cream cheese, there is definitely something for everyone here.
You can get everything from a sausage egg and cheese bagel to a post workout peanut butter and banana sandwich to one piled high with turkey, avocado, sprouts, and cheese. They even have one to help with your hangover. ;-)
While prices start at just over $2, plan on spending $4-6 for a bagel sandwich and even more if you want chips and fountain drink or coffee. But, you will always leave content and looking forward to your next visit, ready to try a different delicious combination."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and the bagels are even better. I always get the Grubby Bubby. There are lots of options for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like this place. Super nice staff, kid friendly, but the steamed bagel sandwiches are just so blah. I have been twice for lunch and this week I brought my husband a sandwich. Three different menu items and the same response for each ... eh.  I will come back with my kiddos but I think I will stick with the basic bagels and cream cheese."}
{"text":"Super cool spot in a small, mixed-use facility just outside downtown Charlotte - Uptown, as I've been told. The place has a young, \"college-y\" feel with things hanging and written all over the walls and tasteful rap music thumping - almost like a club. It also reminded me of my CookOut days while back at uni. Once you've put your order in at the fro t counter you kind of stand/sit around until your number is called.

**caveat: this place may be fast-casual in food order/delivery and have a young/college ethos BUT it is extremely tasty and there were a few families with their babies present. Just saying.

The menu is extensive with plenty of bagel types to choose from with several main/meat ingredients: tuna and Chx salad; turkey; pizza; corned and roast beef; bacon; egg; veggie; etc. Add ons like assorted cheeses and cream cheeses; guacamole; basil; peppers; tomato; pizza sauce; etc. 

They offered for a if their own renditions with all kinds of different combinations or you could build your own w $1.75 bagel and $0.50-$1.00/ topping. On top of being beyond reasonably priced it was super tasty!

I was one human being in a party of four and the Owen's Bagels team happens to let one order slip through the cracks.. after she waited ~25 minutes I approached the counter w the issue. At the end of the day they more than took care of us and made it right.

TL;DR. If you are in Charlotte and don't at least brunch here once, you're doing yourself a huge disservice. This spot is AWESOME! Indoor seating only.

Until next time..

CHEERS!!!"}
{"text":"Owens it just so ridiculously good. It's my weekly indulgence , bacon egg & cheddar on wheat. If I don't have it, I can feel the shakes start. Everyone who works there- including the owner- are so friendly and always take a few minutes to say hello and check in. I love owens !!"}
{"text":"Best bagel in Charlotte!! Quirky place good bagels. I'm from Dallas and just moved here looking for a good bagel place. I have finally found it. My family and I got all different types of bagels and everyone loved what they got. They recommend you get them steamed and I agree!"}
{"text":"On mornings when I'm struggling from the night before or when I need to fuel up for a big day ahead, I'm all about Owen's. 

Some people (you know who you are) go for the really inventive sandwiches with crazy names like Nice Piece of Ash. I, however, get a whole wheat bagel with sausage, egg and pepper jack cheese. Simple but just perfect. 

Also, get the cheese grits. Just do it. 

Make sure you listen for your exact order when it's busy. There's nothing worse than getting home and realizing some dude swiped your bagel."}
{"text":"I think Owens is probably my favorite bagel place in Charlotte.  I had read the positive reviews for weeks before I actually tried the place out.  I'm a huge bagel fan, but had only had them toasted.  A steamed bagel sounded gross to me.  But, I finally tried it and instantly became a big fan.  It has now become my go-to breakfast place. With that being said, despite what a previous reviewer said, they do have a toaster and will toast your bagel, but I would challenge you to try it steamed.  Very good and a different atmosphere than your chain bagel shops.  The snicker doodle coffee is also delicious (even though they don't have it all the time)."}
{"text":"Owen's bagels is by far one of my favorite spots in Charlotte. It was the first place I came to when I moved and I still go there about once a week.  It's a favorite spot of my triathlon team and we go there after practices to refuel.  Love the South End Special.  If you like places that feel unique-- that you can't find in every city--then check out Owen's.  Definitely a staple of Charlotte!"}
{"text":"These delicious steamed bagel sandwiches are, for some reason, great post-exhausting-activity food. And by exhausting activity I mean grueling day of sports or night of drinking, pretty much the same thing.

The choices you have in filling your bagel can be overwhelming, just take a breath, close your eyes, and point to somewhere on the menu. Chances are, it'll be delicious. I typically just get my bagel with egg and cheese..hot melted cheese. *drool*

Decor is eclectic and amusing (there's a UCI Anteater flag hanging by the college flags, random!) and staff is friendly.

Parking in front or behind the building, and bathrooms are down the hall to the left. 

Future reference: Honorary last stop of light rail bar crawl, they have great hangover helpers."}
{"text":"Highly recommend riding your bike or walking here so you don't suffer a heart attack on the way home. Amazing, messy, DELICIOUS bagel sammies. 

Make sure you look around the interior before ordering so you can find the special items. Some are on the wall, some are on small table top signs etc."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  This was one of my favorite places to eat.  Owen's Bagels & Deli is known for their \"Steamed\" bagels.  

My manager and I stopped in for breakfast.  I ordered the \"Mary's Grubby Bubby\" - which consist of egg, cheese, avocado, and tomato on a Bialy.  DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Went here today after hearing it was great for kids and I can say I'm a new fan.  I usually prefer my bagels toasted, not steamed, but their selection of sandwiches was huge and extensive, and mine won me over to the steam-team."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great music and the writing everyone makes you feel welcome. Even though they closed at 2 on July 4th they still made a bagel after 2. First visit and definitely not the last."}
{"text":"Owen's is a gem. I've often contemplated moving to South End only to be close to Owen's. 

There are tons of choices, but you can't go wrong with the Tonya Harding Club, the Southend Special or the Grubby Bubby. 

Plus, iced coffee on tap! 

Get your bagel steamed."}
{"text":"We visited Owen's Bagel & Deli for lunch on a Friday and it was quick and hit the spot! We had a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel and a pimento BLT bagel. The sandwich was good, but the bagel was great! Would highly recommend this place as a quick brunch or lunch spot. Plenty of places to sit and enjoy"}
{"text":"It's so delightful to get a real New York bagel in Charlotte. I grew up eating the real thing and these do not dissapoint. The Mama C's Lox is out of this world!  Sunday mornings are busy but the orders come out very quickly.  I am pretty sure I could eat there every day and never tire of it. :)"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and I will definitely go back! Did not give 5/5 because the specialty bagel prices were a bit much in my opinion (~$6-$8) and no visible Charlotte 49ers flag or pennant that I could see. Disappointing since seemingly almost every other NC university had a small piece of real estate in their shop except for the nearly 30,000 students & 80,000 living alumni (in the Charlotte area at that) university less than 15 minutes away."}
{"text":"Hands down, Owen's is my favorite bagel place in Charlotte. I always get sausage, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel. 3 words- TO DIE FOR. However, my friends do get the fun unique bagel sandwiches and love them! SO GOOD."}
{"text":"The wait was long on a Sunday around lunch time, but well worth it! My first time visiting and I'll definitely be back. Prices are reasonable and the bagel was delicious. Their hummus is made in house and was a great compliment to the one with all veggies."}
{"text":"If I could eat the Tonya Harding club everyday of my life I would die a fat happy happy girl. Hidden gem, truly addictive"}
{"text":"Mary's grubby bubby.... Need I say more? It's amazing!!!! 
The bagel is delicious then add some egg, cheese, avocado and tomato oh my it's soooo good. 
My boyfriend adds turkey for extra protein to the grubby and loves it. 
The place is always hopping, so call ahead if you are in a hurry.

It's the only thing We have ever had here, I'm
Boring and when I find something I love I stick to it. So I don't have any other recommendations for ya. But get your heinie over to Owens if you want New York style bagels in the south."}
{"text":"I've been to Owen's Bagels & Deli twice and have really enjoyed both experiences.  The place is no frills, write on the walls and at the end of a small plaza in the South End neighborhood.
 
The bagel sandwiches that I've had were really good.  The staff is friendly and make the sandwiches delivered promptly.  I enjoyed the coffee that is brewed there too.  The sandwiches are larger than the bagels.  I'd like to see the bagels be larger but I'm happy with my experiences.

I'll definitely be back to Owen's."}
{"text":"Bagel lovers looking for a little something old and a little something new wrapped in an original one of a kind shop need to make Owen's a must-try.  

The basic concept here is bagel sammies which have been steamed into submission.  Is it a little messy?  HELLZ YEAH.  But is it tasty?  Ridiculously so.  When the same-ole' won't cut it for my rise and shine, Owen's can awaken my taste buds.

For you purists, if you just want your round dough with just a schemer of something tasty, or if you like your bagel plain or just toasted, they can do that too.  You just have to ask at the time you order and you just have to know that your combo won't have a cool name posted on the hanging menus.  So kids, once and for all, YES they have a toaster and YES they will toast any sandwich or plain bagel.  Huzzah for customization!

Veggie friends, there are many options here.  Vegan friends, there's love for you too: who knew sprouts, avocado, tomato and hummus could get steamed and turned into such a tasty treat?!  Or how about banana, peanut butter, and local honey (assuming you're OK with honey)?  Gooey fun says me.

I also have to give major props to the locally roasted coffee served here.  Larry's Beans makes small batches and they make some pretty wicked flavors and blends.  The Ethiopian blend was nice but the Southern Pecan was so good it really did need any sweetener.  I walked out with a serious case of the jitters, but it was worth it.

Can't decide which to pick?  In my couple trips here the servers called out the \"Grubby Bubby\" at a ration of about 5:1.  Egg, Muenster, Smoked Cheddar, Avocado and Tomato on a Bialy.  Try picking that up at your local chain bagel shop.  Rock on Owen's crew."}
{"text":"Owens saved my life. I had a critical hangover and the Asiago bagel with bacon ranch cream cheese brought me out of the dark. Bagels imported from NY and housemade cream cheese...doesn't get better. Eat local, try Owens!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! This place has never failed me! I picked up an Asiago Bagel with eggs & pepper jack cheese this morning! So flavorful!"}
{"text":"Yep...  A Groupon brought my girlfriend and me to Owens Bagels for the first time and we were bemused to see a funky interior and funny sounding sandwiches... I had the very delicious Pigs 'n' the Mud and she tried the Dilworthian... we thoroughly enjoyed the sandwiches but were dismayed by the lukewarm, weak coffee... yuck!  The interior appears clean but there were lots of crumbs on the table edges and floor... we aren't clean freaks but they need more staffing to assist with keeping things cleaner and the coffee made hotter/better...

All in all, we'll be back but hoping for improvement..."}
{"text":"Easily the best bagels in Charlotte, and I'm from New Jersey, so I don't kid around about that kind of thing. It's not your traditional New York bagel, but it's steamed it tastes amazing. You can do the traditional bagel and cream cheese (wouldn't recommend steaming these unless you like a gooey cream cheese mess), but my recommendation is the sandwiches. My favorite is the grubby bubby. These sandwiches are so good and gone in two seconds.. I finish one and it takes all my willpower not to get back in line. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is funky and creative, and the food is out of this world. Also, they carry pork roll... so Jersey friends, get to it!"}
{"text":"Great bagels, decent price, many options to pick from.  Friendly cashiers.  All around a great place for a fast bike but, loose the fast part.  This place will take no less than 30 minutes to get your food so come on an off time or be ready to wait."}
{"text":"Meh.
Bagels are steamed therefore, mushy...reminded me of eating play-do.  You'd think they would toast for those who want toasting.  However, it fails me how many businesses prefer to not make money.
Won't be back....sorry, and I so wanted to like this place bc of yelpers and it was local.
Cream cheese spread (spinach) lacked adequate amount of spinach...i mean, come on, if it is called spinach...use some spinach, not just bits of it."}
{"text":"Local bagel shop located just off South Blvd, this place really delivers. Fresh steamed bagels with just about every combination of ingredients you could possibly imagine. My favorite is the Mary's grubby bubby (egg, tomato and avocado) but the hangover helper or classic egg, sausage and cheese taste good on anything. Fresh local coffee is also available self-serve style. Decor inside is pretty neat and unique. Bring a sharpie (or borrow one) if you'd like to add your own personal touch.

Can get really packed later in the mornings, especially on weekends. Parking is available behind the building via a gravel lot. Owen's is on the left when you walk in the building from the lot."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bagel sandwich I've ever had! I never knew such a thing as a steamed bagel even existed till I ate one from here. I tend to steer clear of bagels due to how hard and tough they are, but these were amazing! I got the egg, cheese and avocado bagel and it was fantastic! My friend picked it up so I didn't go inside but from what I hear the ambiance is really cool. The menu seems really extensive but I just went with what I would normally get. Can't wait to go back and try different ones!"}
{"text":"Great tasting Bagels In South End. Lots of Variety to choose from. My order was initially mixed up with someone else's but the problem was quickly resolved by the Manager. Will return for future visits!"}
{"text":"Love me some Momma C's Lox on a pumpernickel bagel with Jalepeno cream cheese! Add some cheerwine and loaded potato salad and you have yourself a feast!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a bagel sammie for breakfast and loved it!! So excited to finally have a great bagel place!"}
{"text":"Mary's Grubby Bubby. OMG! Been lusting for it ever since I had it a week or so ago. Nice joint. Pleasant employees. Quick service. Parking's a little tricky. I'm going back to get another Grubby Bubby!!"}
{"text":"I really wish that I could make this my go to bagel shop...but as the saying goes, 3 strikes and you're out. Prior to todays visit I would give Owens a solid 3 stars. They're Bagels are nothing to rave about...but they do have a pretty funky/unique space and they do offer tons of sandwich options. Personally, I don't really care for all these crazy sandwich combinations. I just want a GOOD bagel with some cream cheese...maybe an egg sandwich. I'm pretty sure if you take two pieces of card board, load it up with the grubby bubby or booty bagel options, or add avocado, tomato. etc - it's going to be tasty. If that's what people are into, that's cool. I'm more about the actual bagel, ya know? 

I've been eating Bagels all my life up in NY and I can honestly say that I was spoiled with the amount of great options that I had up there. And yes I get it, this is Charlotte -- Not NY. Now I'm not a professional, but I'm pretty sure this place skips out on one crucial step of the bagel making process - the poaching step. I do understand that boiling equipment is super expensive and also takes up lots of space. I'm pretty sure that they just brush their bagels with some water and a little baking soda (similar to what you would do with a soft pretzel) and then hit them with steam once they're in the oven. It's easy to identify an imposter by looking at the bottom of the bagel since steam wont get to the bottom of the bagel once its on a pan or in the oven.  

LESSON OF THE DAY: If the bottom is much harder and darker than the rest of the bagel, you're eating a roll with a hole, not a bagel my friend! The bagels here almost remind me of one of those Thomas' bagels from the super market. But anyways, enough about the bagels.

Today's experience brought them down to a 2 star rating - I ordered a bacon egg & cheese (with salt, pepper, ketchup) to go and I got a small coffee - My bill was  $8.39. The word \"pricey\" doesn't usually come out of my mouth....but I walked out of the store thinking to myself...\"dear god, did I just pay almost $9 for a bagel & small coffee?\"

I get to my office, sit down and go to enjoy my sandwich, which for that price should have been wrapped in gold foil. Slowly, disappointment began sinking in 
(insert worlds saddest song on worlds smallest violin here**)

1) My sandwich was pretty small - hey, it is what it is. I wouldn't complain about it being small if it at least tasted delicious and the order didn't get screwed up. 2) The eggs reminded me of dunkin donut egg sandwiches - you know, those premade egg patties that get nuked in the microwave. 3) Lastly, they left out the salt, pepper & ketchup!!! The SPP is crucial on my egg sandwiches! 

BEC with salt, pepper, ketchup...doesn't seem like a difficult order. Anyways,I'm happy that most people on here have had a great experiences here... I wish I could feel the same way. 

Long story LONGGGGG, It's safe to say that I won't be coming back to Owens. As I mentioned earlier, I really wish I could make my go to spot since they are around the corner from where I live...but it does look like I'll have to take a 10min drive elsewhere when I'm in the mood for bagels -- (wont name drop other businesses as I don't like to do that)."}
{"text":"Their bagels are the best. Definitely worth the wait on a Saturday or Sunday morning. Parking is a pain though so if you are close enough I recommend walking."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It's actually inside a larger building that had other things in it like a nail salon but it was still super easy to find. Parking was not a hassle which as always is a plus for me. I loved the decor. There was graffiti all over the walls which sort of reminded me of back home in NYC. There were plenty of tables as well. Then again I did go pretty early. The staff was extremely courteous as it was my first time there. I opted for the Sweet Caroline bagel. Basically a blueberry bagel with cinnamon sugar and cream cheese. It was SO GOOD! I wished it was bigger tho. I've never seen coffee on tap but the cold brew was on tap. I tried to get a video of me working the machine but i deleted it by mistake. I'm not the smartest sometimes. Anyway the coffee was self serve so I poured as much creamer and sugar in as I could lol. The price for both was decent. About $7 for both the bagel and the coffee. I'd definitely go back to try some of the other variations just based off of this experience. Good Stuff!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast/brunch/lunch spots to eat and work. I've never been disappointed by the steamed bagel with cream cheese and loaded pimento cheese grits. I mean, yum! The music is perfect, it's a great variety and it's fun to watch the other patrons dance or read the walls when I hit a brain fart. I literally spend at least three hours there working, eating and drinking the locally roasted coffee."}
{"text":"Owen's Bagel & Deli is located in \"The Pavilion @ South End\" shopping center, in the South End district of Charlotte. The retail center is oddly designed, with multiple vacancies at the moment. 

I thought that the bagels were made on the premises, but a sign at the door announced that the bagels served were actually from New York. Curious about the steamed heating method, I did not allow the sign to deter me from entering, although I was a little concerned about another sign taped to the door where the resto apologized for the \"inconsistency\" of the bagels. 

The bagel shop itself looked more like a university dining commons room gone wild, with school banners all about and graffiti over every inch of the walls. As I waited for my order, a simple onion bagel with cream cheese and a breakfast bagel, I spied a poster that read \"War is unsafe for children and living things\".  A rather smart thought, however, on each table was a table tent advertising that they were switching back to styrofoam cups, since patrons did not like the plastic ones. Styrofoam? Does that not hurt living things as well, sitting in landfill, since styrofoam does not decompose? A bit of a contradiction I thought. 

A few moments later my order came out and as others commented, the bagel heating process makes the bread chewy, however, I didn't mind, since I was prepared for that. If I wanted a traditional bagel, I would have stopped by the bagel shop a few blocks down the street, however, since this cooking method appeared to be a local thing, I had to try it out. 

Overall, nice staff, reasonable prices and interesting decor. The heating method itself, well ... interesting."}
{"text":"I had Mary's Grubby bubby and added turkey sausage which was great! Will definitely be back when we are in the area. Only downside the wait is a bit took a decent amount for 2 sandwiches to come out. Food was excellent tho!"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed when I walked into this place: Owen's Bagel & Deli is definitely a popular spot for the hung over kids in Southend.

As long as I'm grabbin' and goin', I'm a fan of this place. When I linger and eat my bagel inside, Owen's neighbor, some nail place, tends to give me a headache due to the fumes.

Minimal vegan options, but these bagels are mighty tasty. I tend to go with the Cinnamon Raisin and PB. Owen's definitely caters more to the omnivores-- there are a lot of bagel sandwich options."}
{"text":"Though it's kinda hard to find Owen's, you'll be glad once you do. We absolutely love this place. It's awesome--especially for a big breakfast or lunch sandwich when you're super hungover. At least that's what I've found. 

Owen's is, when you get down to it, a bagel sandwich place--no more, no less (though they do have some other snacks and sides, like brownies, chips, cookies, and pasta salad). That's why you should come here. Their bagels are fresh and they have an extensive selection, from pumpernickel to Everything. 

Their sandwich combos are super creative and equally extensive. Literally, you can order any thing you think of, or something Owen's has already thought of. My girlfriend loves their Hummus and Veggie Bagel. I go for the Reuben, which comes smothered with great cheese and mustard. Check out their menu--it's amazing (with funny names too). 

Also, they steam their bagels--with the meat, cheese and veggies/sauce they've already put in it. It's interesting, but usually tastes great, so long as you dont select a sandwich best served cold."}
{"text":"My bacon, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel was tasty -- a solid 5-star breakfast sandwich. However, Ted's sausage, egg, and cheese on onion was pretty gross. It was something about the sausage patty. It was flavorless and mushy. Really unappetizing. 

We also attempted to share a plain bagel with the Reese's Peanut Butter cream cheese but could  only get a couple bites down. The bagel was what you'd expect, but the cream cheese was a total let down! I think it was just plain cream cheese with a couple peanut butter cups melted/steamed in there. So, the flavors were kind of sour from the plain cream cheese, sweet from the chocolate, rich from the peanut butter. Not great. 

I'm glad we tried them out. (I love trying new places!) But, unfortunately, we won't be back to Owens. I just can't bring myself to schlep to South End for a hit or miss breakfast when the incomparable Poppy's is just around the corner from our house."}
{"text":"Amazing. A must. I really can't emphasize this enough. YOU MUST GO TO OWEN'S! Your bagel experience will never be the same. Their steamed bagels - breakfast or sandwich style - are made to order however your heart desires, and they are a scientifically proven cure for hangovers. Fact. 
Personal fave: egg, provolone, turkey, and tomato - panini grilled to finish - on wheat bagel. Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Impressed! I'm from NY and it has been so hard trying to find a decent bagel/breakfast sandwich place down here. Whelp, I found one! 

First, the atmosphere is awesome. Calling all hipsters! I felt like I was in a Seattle or a San Francisco coffee shop. They had old magazine covers hung up, things were hand written and drawn. It was very comfy and inviting which makes your experience ten times better! 

Second, REAL EGGS!!!! like they crack them themselves. First place I've found down south that does this. I got the Mary's Grubby Bubby (smoked cheddar, muenster, eggs, tomato, avocado on a bialy)....YUM! This had every flavor you want in a breakfast sandwich, sweet and smoky! Usually I like a breakfast meat on my sandwiches but this sandwich doesn't even need it. The smoky cheddar makes you feel like there is bacon on it and the avocado adds just the right amount of sweet. My boyfriend got a sausage, egg, and cheese which was just as delicious-felt like we were back in NY! 

Third, the service was awesome! The girl at the register was super friendly and seemed genuinely interested in making sure we were happy. She answered our questions and talked with us about being from NY. There was a big open kitchen allowing you to see the cooking happen which is always a plus! The only suggestion I have is instead of calling out people's orders, ask for names and call those out so it's easier for customers to listen for their own name. But other than that, Owens has 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"Prompt and busy. Expect a wait on weekends. Bagels are so yummy and fresh. Good variety, coffee is average. Wish they had more seating space."}
{"text":"Owen's is our go-to spot for bagels on the weekends.  Try Mary's Grubby Bubby or the Phish bagel sandwich.  So good.  Our kids love the chocolate cream cheese.  They have tons of sandwiches to choose from or you can build your own.  The also have coffee and Gatorade for rough mornings.  All around solid spot for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This weekend, we decided to head down to Greenville, SC for the Fall of Greenville Festival. Before we left we made a quick stop at one of Jake and I'd favorite places, Owen's Bagels. This hole in the wall is found in the South End area in a shopping area so you really have to look for it. This quick breakfast place has an in & out atmosphere. Order your food, eat there if you choose too, and head out. Owen's has many different bagel options for you to choose from. Some are very strange compilations but so far I haven't had one I didn't like. The best part has to be the names of the Bagels! For example: A Nice Piece of Ash, Hangover Helper, Sweet Caroline, Donkey Punch, and many more! In the pictures below you will see A Nice Piece of Ash and the Angry Steve. If you're looking for some spice to start your morning, Angry Steve is the one for you. I love that they have sprouts on it. Another one I truly enjoy is the Sweet Caroline; it has a blueberry bagel with cinnamon and cream cheese inside. It's one of their simple ones."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! My husband and I discovered it about two months ago and we have gone at least once a week since! Delicious steamed bagel sandwiches all day long, fast and well priced! Winning!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Charlotte! Owen's is not your average bagel shop. They're sandwiches are packed with lots of fresh ingredients. Personally I'm a fan of the Southend Special. If you live in the area or you're just visiting you have to go to Owen's! It's a fun spot with good atmosphere and music and plenty of seating. I've definitely been in here before and had to wait a long time for my sandwich so that can be frustrating, but still always worth a visit! 

Tip: they have a loyalty card! Buy a certain amount of bagels and get one free"}
{"text":"Great bagel sandwiches that add a fresh take to the idea of a deli sandwich. Lines are always an obstacle but it's generally worth it. Flavors are always good (rarely outstanding) but this is a great asset to the area."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bagel places in Charlotte. New Yorkers- shut up. I know it isn't as good as a NY bagel. But it is delicious. 

The place is quirky. People write silly quotes on the wall. You see a lot of teenagers here (I get it- this would totally be my hangout if I were a teen). You can smell the nail polish for Polished- which is next door to them (that is gross)

The Bialy bagel is SO YUMMY. 

The menu is really overwhelming. There are plenty of vegetarian options. 

This place makes me happy."}
{"text":"Unreal. Most consistently impressive breakfast sandwich joint I've ever been to. The Mary's Grubby Bobby, The Dilworthian and The Fish are personal favorites, but I've never been disappointed here. Waits can be long, but the service is pretty quick and friendly,  the price is great and the coffee is solid. Eat here."}
{"text":"Cute and hipster bagel joint next to downtown Charlotte. We got the Mary's Grubby Hubby with poppyseed bagel and Jalapeño cream cheese and Mama's C Lox with jalapeño bagel. Both were delicious. The Mary's grubby hubby came with a soft bagel, and the mama's C lox's bagel was crunchy. get your free fountain drink when you check- in on yelp. You could also exchange it for coffee. They had ice coffee for the same price and free refills ! 
There were also memorabilia and interesting drawings all over the wall, seemed like a fun spot to hangout ."}
{"text":"Owen's needs to move to a new location.  It is located inside a shabby mini-mall and  there is a nail salon across the hall from this restaurant from which  the odors are quite prevalent. I'm surprised that this is allowed in the health code.  I get a headache from the odors just waiting for my food and will never sit inside the restaurant to eat, which is a shame.  The inside is decorated with all kinds of things that would take an entire day to completely discover.  If the bagel shop had walls that reached up to the ceiling it would help keep the nail salon odors out.  Other than this, the bagels are fresh and there is quite an extensive and creative listing of sandwiches to choose from.  There are plenty of vegetarian and vegan choices.  Service is pretty good.  You can't expect speed when making a bagel so don't be in a hurry when you come here - just plug your nose."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, as I live very close, but I doubt I will go back. I'm a vegetarian, and obviously order only vegetarian bagels. Nearly EVERY time, I find bits of bacon on the bagel, and it smells of meat. Today I got it to go and couldn't return it, so I was just out the money- which is really annoying. They are very sloppy here, and also don't always listen to what you are asking for; like, \"don't put it on the grill/boiler\". The eggs aren't very good either. 
Basically, if you are a vegetarian or have food allergies - or just like to get what you actually order- don't go here. If you'll eat anything, you'll probably like it."}
{"text":"With great bagel sandwich names and wonderful combinations, Owen's Bagels is a solid locale to grab breakfast and/or lunch. The menu can be a bit overwhelming, so they have it narrowed down by the type of meat involved (which is helpful for folks who only eat certain meats). And if you go on the weekend, be prepared for a line and a bit of a wait due to the popularity of this trendy little joint. 

I've tried the following:

1. The Muenster Mash on a whole wheat bagel - Hummus, Muenster, Green Peppers, Onion, Lettuce, and Tomato. Seriously good. My favorite bagel at Owen's. No need for meat when you have all this delicious veggieness on one homemade bagel. And at only $4.00, this is a steal.

2. Sir Purr's Purrfect Bagel on whole wheat - Turkey, Veggie Cream Cheese, Smoked Cheddar, Lettuce, Tomato. I never thought I'd say this, but there was WAY too much cheese on this thing. Not sure if the maker of the sandwich was just heavy-handed with the veggie cream cheese or what, but I had to scrape a bunch of it off before I could even eat the sandwich. After that it was very good. A bit more expensive at $5.65.

3. Cinnamon Raisin Bagel with Maple Nut Cream Cheese - I do not recommend this option. The bagel barely had any raisins in it and wasn't really very cinnamon-y, either. And the maple nut cream cheese was disgusting. Go for one of the sandwiches and you'll be much happier with your experience.

Be sure to bring your appetite as the bagel sammies are quite large. And take some time to read all the funny little quips written on the walls - or write some for yourself - either way you'll be entertained. Owens is located in South End across from the Atherton Mills Market. So swing in for a bagel sammie and then run across the street for some healthy fruits and veggies. A win-win all around!"}
{"text":"Why would you steam a bagel?!? Boiled and baked has worked fine for 400 years. Steaming just makes them soggy.

I hate leaving negative reviews, but people need to know what they're getting into. Do not go here expecting a normal bagel. Most places (including the best delis in the world) boil and then bake them.  A few places like Owens are experimenting with steaming them instead. Problem is, they come out soggy! Especially if you get one to go, that's sat in foil paper. This is why these places aren't catching on. My order was a simple bagel with egg, and it was a soggy mess. It fell apart while I was eating it, like I was eating lumpy oatmeal with my hands.

I think people's opinions of this place are skewed because it's a hip bohemian-ish atmosphere with writing on concrete walls, old furniture, etc. It's a very Charlotte thing to do. We love our gentrified pretend hole in the wall. But I'm sorry, this place wouldn't last a week somewhere like NYC.

If you want a great bagel, do yourself a favor, and go somewhere like Poppy's. Get a real bagel, prepared properly just as they have been for centuries."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but service is truly awful. I came in today for a late lunch (1:30) and immediately noticed two ladies smoking right outside the door. At a bar? fine. At a dining establishment? Not acceptable. I walked in and realized that the two women smoking were the employees. One should be at least inside waiting for customers and the smoking should be done away from the front entrance. 

Anyway I went with one of their turkey sandwiches and asked to add tomato and veggie cream cheese and that my bagel be toasted. I realize this was a special order however, considering I was the only customer  it shouldn't have been that difficult to get right.

I also tried to be friendly and chat - and in response received not a smile, nothing. Not sure if it was just a bad day for them, but I couldn't help but feel as though they were irritated that I interrupted their smoke break.  

I got all the way to work only to realize my bagel wasn't toasted...which as a New York native is a big no-no . It still tasted good, but I always toast my bagels even at home so I was really disappointed. 

Considering they have gotten my order wrong more times than not, I may have to try poppy's in order to get my bagel fix. This makes me sad since Owen's has such a cool vibe and pretty darn good bagels."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The vibe is cool with music blasting, writing on the walls and friendly staff. 

While the wait was longer than I anticipated (15+ minutes) it was well worth it. I ordered the Angry Steve and it did not disappoint. It was a hearty breakfast sandwich. My boyfriend ordered Ya Boi which is similar to the Crunch and Munch at Bagel and Deli at Miami University in Oxford, OH. He gave it a 5 star rating.

I will definitely be back. I plan to print off a menu and cross off the ones I've tried. There are so many it's hard to choose!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely off my reuben experience - this rating could vary significantly with something more common from Owen's.

A bagel place offering a reuben is certainly an interesting option, and I was excited to continue my reuben adventure with this unique take on the classic sandwich. I wish I had tried something more common (although that wouldn't have worked well to continue my journey around Charlotte to try all of the reubens the city has to offer).

The reubagel, as I decided to call it, just didn't have a setup for success. A bagel is significantly thicker than any rye bread you're going to find, so I think it has to be overstuffed (NYC style) to really get the proper proportions. Sadly, this one was not. Each bite tasted like bagel with a little bit of meat and cheese mixed in. The middle ingredients were fairly common, with average corned beef, very little kraut, good swiss but lacking in quantity, and a russain dressing that was a little sweeter than what works for a reuben. The pumpernickel rye bagel was tasty, but that was too be expected from a bagel place. I don't recommend trying the reubagel as there are far better options on the menu."}
{"text":"i walk here constantly and love owens.  they have very creative bagel sammy combos and good coffee.  i like going for bfast or lunch, mandy's mayhem or mark cuban look-a-like are both my jams.  they're in a neat space and if you would like a lap dance with your bagel and coffee you just have to walk across the street to leather and lace"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never been here. It's been a sound end staple for a while.

Piece of advice... on Sunday early morning there is loud rap music playing.  This is perfect for getting ready for a Sunday funday or really loud if you had a long night before .  When I walked it I felt like I was in a different city.  The graffiti and decor is eclectic and fun. 

The line was really long but moved fast.  I found that a lot of people were calling in their orders and taking them outside to enjoy the amazing weather.

You order at the counter, grab a number, and there are water cups while you wait. 

I got the everything bagel with veggie cream cheese and my husband got the everything BEC.  

I really liked my bagel a lot!  I have never had a steamed bagel and it was a nice surprise.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Forget your chains like Bruegger's or Einsteins.  Take advantage of Owen's Bagel & Deli.  Their bagels are far more NY authentic and less commercial quality.  They toast, they steam, and they have a menu that can't be beat.  I tend to drop in once a week at breakfast.  Not a great coffee selection but it's also not a coffeehouse so I can't base the review on that.  

I tend to grab an Everything w Cream Cheese, a Breakfast Bagel, the Hangover Helper, or Mary's Grubby Bubby (pictured : Egg, Muenster, Smoked Cheddar, Avacado, Tomato on a Bialy).  Grubby Bubby is so so good and fresh.  All fantastic.  Best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"These people were working so hard to get breakfast to hungry Charlotteans on Sunday! I was very impressed with the staff while they were absolutely slammed! Ive seen this place a thousand times but didn't actually know how big it is inside or how busy they get. 

The menu has about 10,000 choices so it was really hard to make a decision. Went with one of the specials, which was a cubano bagel. My only complaint is that the pulled pork on my bagel was really dry. I would just get something else next time!"}
{"text":"I love bagels.  Whenever I go to New York, I have to get a bagel from one of the carts on the street, and at least one from a deli with a breakfast sandwich on it.  I love bagels so much that it's almost worth going to New York City just for the bagels.  I'm sorry, but places like Brueggers and Einstein Brothers just aren't the same (as decent as they are).

The bagels at Owen's, however, are different.  I don't know if they are the match of New York bagels, but they are awfully close.  The one thing you have to know - as has been mentioned - is that the bagels are steamed, rather than toasted.  It's a little different, but not entirely bad.  Just go in expecting it and you'll probably be okay.

Once you get past that, you'll find that the ingredients definitely set the place apart.  It's worth the trip.  You do have to have a bit of funk in you, as the walls are covered with quasi-graffiti, but it's not bad."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall place; reminds me of breakfast spots by college campuses. Good for a quick bagel to go, line moves fast and menu is overwhelming so I just go with my usual poppy toasted regular cream cheese. Take your sandwich across the street to Not Just Coffee for seating and better drinks."}
{"text":"Decided to try Owens bagels again and rating it a 4! Friendly service and their sweet Caroline was delicious! Bagel was warm, soft, sweet, everything I expected it to be. Had the right amount of sweetness to it. Also tried their Mary's grubby a good hangover bagel. Def worth trying all three!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The menu is creative and the quality is consistent. I would recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"A laid back and fun atmosphere. As I sit here writing this, Nikki Minaj is blasting through the speakers and it makes for the perfect place to follow up my Saturday night. They offer lots of creative options and gluten-free and vegan as well! Which is great because I have several friends who fall into this category and it's always tough to find a place for breakfast when they visit. 

Parking can be tricky and the line does get long but their steamed bagels and sandwich creations are worth the visit. They don't try to hard and that's what I like about it. From the handcrafted menus, wiring on the walls and delicious food, you're sure to be glad you came."}
{"text":"I was finally able to try Owen's for the first time today, and the visit was a mix of good and bad.
The good: the quality of the food was solid. I ordered Mary's gubby bubby, and the bagel was excellent. It was perfectly steamed and still somewhat soft despite being a denser type of bread. The other ingredients were fresh too, but the bagel really shined. 
The bad: it took almost 15 minutes to get my bagel. It wasn't unusually busy and the workers seemed to be going pretty quickly but it was a bit slower than I expected. The taste of the bagel was good but nothing really stood out as outstanding, either. The eggs seemed microwaved or re-warmed and other than the bagel, nothing impressed me. My biggest complaint: the size/price. The bagel sandwich I got was tiny - much smaller than bagels from other bakeries or even what you would get from the supermarket. It was fairly tasty, but for $6+ and a 15 minute wait, I would expect a much larger bagel.
Overall, the bagel impressed me, so I might be willing to come back, but everything else left me pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"I love me some bagels. Large doughy goodness and covered with schmear, please. And Owen's Bagel & Deli certainly delivers - in a big, creative, steamy way. 

I've frequented Owen's many a time and I always appreciate the local, hippy vibe that rocks through the scrawled upon walls. It's a very casual haunt, where you can grab some morning breakfast or a quick lunch. You'll see all sorts of customers here - from the church crowd to the hungover college kids. The bagel connoisseurs who work at Owen's are very laid back and friendly. Be prepared to chuckle while reading their menu - they have incredibly creative sandwich names like The Mark Cuban and The Tonya Harding Club. 

While I've tried many delicious bagel sammies here, but I always go back to my old standby - the Banana Surprise. It's a cinnamon raisin bagel, slathered with cream cheese, covered in bananas and a dusting of cinnamon sugar. It's incredible. Husband always orders a Mr. Turkey with egg, also a delicious choice. All the bagels and bagel sandwiches are steamed and that makes them super tasty and chewy. Oh, and their coffee is local, which just makes me love them even more. 

Head on over to Owen's for a monstrous steamed bagel sandwich, and if you're not full enough, make sure you grab a cookie on the way out - they are the size of your face and a sugary dream."}
{"text":"I like supporting a local business and this is a good one. My go to here is a bacon egg and cheese on a plain. It takes a few minutes to prepare it which is fine. It is extremely soft and gooey and tasty after steeping it. It's really good but also over $5 just for the sandwich which pulled the rating down a star."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever actually written a love letter, so I guess it's time to change that. 

Dear Owen's, I love you. I don't care how long the line is, you are always worth the wait. You make me happy when skies are gray and are the perfect remedy for my worst hangover. I would totally be in a committed Facebook relationship with you. Translation: that's a huge deal. When you had to temporarily close because a car ran through the wall, I felt like a family member had died. 

I discovered Owen's about ten years or so ago when they first opened. I selfishly wanted to keep it a secret. It's tucked on the end of the little shopping center on South Blvd next to Polished. Leather and Lace is on the other side of it. Don't stare directly at it during daylight hours.

So what do you need to know?
*There's a line on the weekends. It moves quickly. Be patient. 
*Home of the steamed bagel! Ton of options (including veggie) on the menu. You can even build your own. If you can't find something you like here, then maybe you should talk to yourself in the mirror. The problem may be you.
*There's graffiti all over the walls
*Don't see a spot in front? There's a parking lot behind it

I don't have a go-to order here because I like too many things here. My new current-crush and go-to is the Nice Piece of Ash. Great name. It's like a Kool Jules or South End Special on steroids. Who's Ash? She's the owner and a local Johnson & Wales Alum. That's right. Locally owned. 

Owen's also does catering and you can call in your pick-up order ahead of time. They also have giant pickles. I ask for it cut in four pieces and then I don't share them with anyone. Hours alert: they close at 2pm on Mondays and 3pm all the other days."}
{"text":"Very good.  The owner/workers clearly have a passion for food.  Parking and finding the doorway are slightly confusing, but no biggie.  Had a lox bagel w/ capers.  Prices were just a little high for what it was, but I'll go back and support this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and one of Charlotte's best kept secrets! Really laid back ambiance and the perfect spot to grab your favorite bagel sandwich. The manager and staff are super friendly and actually care about their patrons, which is why this place continue to grow. Highly recommend for a delicious, quick breakfast!"}
{"text":"I wish I lived in CLT solely so I could start every Saturday morning off with a bagel from here. The \"Nice Piece of Ash\" is HUGE and has so many ingredients but is so delicious. Get here early - the line will be out the door, but they do a good job keeping the line moving. I also appreciate the music they play - it gets pretty hype at 8:30am!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast bagel and amazing atomosphere will be back to to try again soon."}
{"text":"Would easily be 5 stars but if you like horrible loud rap and a shitty atmosphere ...best bagels and service, worst building ever! Between the horrible smelling nail place that is open air to Owens and the rotten always broken and not serviced bathroom it's a real detractor from a place that has much more potential."}
{"text":"Parking is a little tricky, but it's totally worth it for this local gem! I'm a traditional sesame and cream cheese kind of girl, but the friendly guy at the counter suggested the pimento BLT on asiago, and I went for it. Hot and melty and crispy and quite possibly this BEST bagel sandwich I have ever had. I want it again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Delicious - reminds me of bodo's bagels in Charlottesville, VA.  The only genuine home grown bagel place I know of in Charlotte.  Customers have written all over the wall - fun to read while you are waiting for your scrumptious bagel sandwich!"}
{"text":"Best bagel place in Charlotte - you can tell because it is always packed on the weekends and it also has a prime location in Southend. Their bagels are steamed and delicious, you can't go wrong with any of their speciality sandwiches. My go to is either a classic bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel or the Angry Steve (egg, sausage, cheese, peppers, onions and spicy ranch). I will say they are small so get 2 if you are used to huge NYC bagels!"}
{"text":"This is what I call a bagel shop! I got a turkey sausage egg and cheese with chive cream cheese.. The food is awesome, ambiance is awesome, staff is awesome, service is awesome and I love how they value their employees.. they look happy! I will be back."}
{"text":"Breakfast bagel on toasted asiago cheese bagel sausage egg and cheese with Swiss. This is absolutely awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The first time I went (a few years ago) I was weary about getting a steamed bagel ( I love my toasted NY bagels) but it was delish!  I started out with 'safer' bagel options, the Sweet Caroline (blueberry bagel, cream cheese and cinnamon & sugar) delish and a good 1st timer bagel- but I still get it all the time!  I have since tried various sandwich bagels and have never been disappointed, they will let you add or remove items to your liking with no problem.
When my husband found out that there was an Owen's in Charlotte he was excited, being a Miami of Ohio alum he ate there all the time in college-
I can't say anything about the coffee, because I don't drink it- but I'm sure if you aren't happy with the temp, you can ask them for some fresh coffee and they would be happy to accommodate

We frequent Owen's a lot and love it every time!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start with these guys..It always takes FOREVER for your food, even when you're the only one in there..bagels..well, they're flippin' steamed..who the F*CK does that..no toaster? seriously? why the hell do I want a chewy mutha f*ckin' bagel?..Cream cheese, bland...the people that work there are complete morons.. 

the decor and the deserts are the ONLY positive thing about this place...oh yeah..the chips..those are good b/c well...they already come made"}
{"text":"This place is really good. I had order a Mama's Lox bagel, and my boyfriend ordered an Angry Steve. I was so excited to eat my bagel and to my surprise I ate my boyfriends bagel by mistake. It was so good. Really spicy but worth it. I'll have to go back to try the Mama lox one now since I ate the other one."}
{"text":"Awesome and creative bagels! Not your ordinary deli place. There is a large selection of menu items to pick from. The staff is very friendly and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I've never had a steamed bagel before, but after hearing so many good things about Owen's Bagel, my husband and I (finally!) had to give them a try.  They are a bit tricky to find, located in The Pavilion, a small strip shopping center across from Atherton Mill.  

Once we found parking, we headed inside.  Owen's is located inside The Pavilion, and they have a fun and quirky vibe.  You stand in line and order at the counter, then wait for your number to be called to pick up your food.  There are a few seats inside, as well as seats in The Pavilion and outside the back door.  

The first time, I ordered a plain bagel with egg, cheddar, and avocado, and my husband got a sesame bagel with bacon, egg, and American cheese.  After waiting about 10-15 minutes on a busy Saturday, we picked up our order.  The bagels were hot (from the steaming!), and were absolutely delicious.  My avocado bagel was loaded with scrambled eggs, avocado, and cheddar.  It was soft, cheesy, and just wonderful.  My husband's bacon bagel was similarly good, and he preferred the American cheese.  

The second visit I ordered Mary's Grubby Bubby, another vegetarian option with a tomato, avocado, Muenster and cheddar cheese, and scrambled egg on a bialy.  I've had bialys before and this one seemed fatter, like the usual bagel, but it was absolutely delicious.  It's my new favorite!  My husband got the standard bacon, egg, and cheese again, but he also got a steamed cream cheese bagel.  I had some of that the cream cheese bagel, and it was so good!  

Coffee is served one size, and they have two flavors - bold and light.  The bold satisfied our desire for strong coffee!

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in the nation!  Since visiting NC, this was by far the tastiest food I've had.  If you're into the spices, you gotta try the Mateo Ranchero"}
{"text":"No toaster. NO TOASTER. WHY must the best bagels in CLT be forced into a sauna to steam away all their crusty, crunchy potential?

Toppings are diverse, coffee is good. Staff is cute and stoned. Decor is rad, and I feel totally comfy, until EVERYTHING IN MY 6 DOLLAR BREKKIE SAMMICH comes pouring out, onto my lap, onto my dry-clean-only Interview Shirt, and then that's it - I'm throwing a tantrum (in my head at least) and tossing the wet mess into the bin. Give us the option, kids. Don't be Steamer Fascists."}
{"text":"March 11 2016 , second visit Tried chia sandwhich was great , tried veggie cheese was great . a should try place . best time to go mornings"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you have small kids and time. The wait for getting your food can be a little long so if you're in a hurry to get back to work then maybe this isn't the right place for you.

If you have some time and want a great bagel sandwich with a laid back atmosphere then you don't want to miss stopping by here. The walls are covered with graffiti (don't be afraid to add your own) and the music is an ecclectic mix. There is even a play area for smaller children with toys and books.

The sandwiches are made on real NY bagels and are steamed. I prefer mine toasted and they can do that too. I've had a few of their cleverly named sandwiches and you can even invent your own for them if you'd like. The breakfast sandwiches are great and filling. They even off free trade coffee along with a great mix of teas. During the winter months they offer a new soup each day which is delicious and satisfying. I love this place."}
{"text":"This is a fun spot to grab a quick(ish) lunch. The people there are always nice. I mix up my order but most recently got \"a nice piece of ash\" and they were more than patient with all of my modifications. It was made fresh and the steamed bagel was perfect. I got the bagel and a homemade rice crispy treat and it was about $10, which (to me) is a little steep but I like supporting a local spot so it's cool. The few times I've had a fountain drink, it's been flat but I haven't had it enough to say it's always that way. 

Overall, a good spot."}
{"text":"The bagels here are fantastic. I have always enjoyed the variety as well as the service. HOWEVER, the iced coffee here was the worst coffee I have ever had in my entire life. It was absolutely disgusting. DO NOT EVER GET THE ICED COFFEE."}
{"text":"I have become a huge Owen's fan. This funky little spot hidden from the street inside the Pavilion in the South End is worth finding. It has amazing character, with its off beat decor and sharpie decorated tables. 

But the real reason I visit Owen's is for the bagels. We transplanted New Yorkers are at a loss for real bagels - most of CLT is dominated by bagel chains that serve soft, doughy round rolls and call them bagels. Owen's has the real deal - dense, chewy, with real bite. 

I have become addicted to a cream cheese I'd never have tasted prior to my CLT move. Bacon, ranch, scallion cream cheese - salty, tangy, tasty, perfect on a toasted sesame bagel. Owen's also offers sandwiches and fun, creative options for bagel based food. Try it. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Today I went for lunch and got a customized bagel. Everything bagel with bacon, pepper jack cheese, and cream cheese. I also got a coffee and cheese grits. The coffee was amazing and brewed to perfection. They accidentally added egg to my bagel so they instantly remade it and even gave me the egg one to give away. The bagel was hot and delicious. I definitely will be going back and recommending this place to everyone. The staff is always so nice and friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Get the Mary's grubby bubby. I think I ate one every weekend for two years. Oops. You can bring in your pup too."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I love how deconstructed the décor is, form the unfinished wall, to the endless graffiti, the clothesline menu, etc. I love the laid back concept where anyone can just go hangout and write on pretty much anything.

The bagels were excellent. I had the Nova Lox with capers and onions. Delicious. When we went it was pretty empty but it was like a Tuesday around 11 or something like that.

The staff were very helpful and friendly. They explained about their bagels and preparation methods, etc.

I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Love the bagels here - einsteinium could learn a thing or two from this local down to earth place. There's no frills and that's why I like it - come in get a bagel and a coffee, eat it and go. That's what it's all about. Very we'll done"}
{"text":"Hands down the best bagel place in Charlotte. We've been here several times and had Mary's Grubby Bubby, Nice Piece of Ash, South End Special, Ya Boi, and Phillipa's Phetish. Every single one was amazing. The steamed bagels are great. We'll definitely be coming back to sample more of the menu"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Owens bagels!!! Being a northern girl in the south I have to have a go-to bagel place and this little gem in South End is my place ! Love the laid back ambience and the funny/quirky names of their bagel sandwiches. You can order the sandwiches \"as-is\" or build your own. I also love all the amazing flavored cream cheeses; they always have their creative constants like bacon ranch and jalapeño but they also will sometimes throw in another wacky seasonal to see how it's liked. My stand-by recipe is the Mama Cs lox with jalapeño on everything I definitely recommend it if you want something filling, with a good balance of breakfast and lunch. My boyfriends go-to is the Grubby Bubby or the pimento BLT - both are AWESOME and I always have to steal a bite .. Or two. Great place, great bagels -- efficient service whether busy or slow , check this spot out if you haven't !!!"}
{"text":"Bacon, egg, and pimento cheese bagel- ie the perfect cure for a hungry weekend morning. Bagels are steamed unless you ask otherwise, which isn't a bad thing. Long line, but definitely a must visit establishment in Charlotte."}
{"text":"After all the years I've lived in Charlotte, I had never been to Owen's. I mean, how different could THESE bagels be? Bagel sandwiches, done before --or so I thought. I wasn't aware of the whole steamed bagel concept. 

On my maiden voyage I ordered the chicken salad special and my lunch date had the Tonya Harding. His was much better than mine  but I have to say, the bagels were just soooo good. I have definitely been missing out. Will be trying the egg sandwich and other options in the near future. I am sort of obsessing about trying more and more steamed bagel options and sort of wish I kept myself in the dark.

If you haven't gone to Owen's - go!"}
{"text":"It's baaaaaccckkkk *In the style of Carol Anne*

A car smashing through your wall is not a thing to take lightly, but you would never know it happened. Kudos to the construction team. 
Owens is just wonderful. These are steamed bagels, so no, NY and NJ, they're not your typical type of bagels. I don't think they're trying to be. They have a big menu, I truly haven't had anything I dislike. They always provide fresh ingredients and really quick service. My only dislike is that they don't have a second location!

They're awesome about substitutions with their sandwiches, so don't be afraid to ask if you don't like something, or you want another flavor bagel. 

I'll admit, one of my favorite things to do here is play \"where's the quote\" with other people I'm with. 

Can you find: \"DEEZ NUTS! Ha.... GOT EM!\" ? Good luck, yelpers."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 of the nice piece of Ash, great sandwich bagel, wife is hooked on Owens bagels now. Very friendly staff. On my list to go too for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Bagels are a staple of American culture. Owen's is a staple of Charlotte culture. Everything about it screams classic bagel joint. For a morning bagel breakfast in the QC, this is the place to go. And if you are looking for a twist on the classic egg sandwich, the Mary's grubby bubby is phenomenal"}
{"text":"Owens is so delicious! Immediately became my go to bagel stop. Obsessed with their spinach cream cheese. It is literally spinach infused cream cheese and it's a must try. I've never seen anything like it before! I recommend trying your bagel steamed. I have never heard of that before and It's amazing. Such a fun atmosphere with up beat staff and music. Enjoy sitting outside as well with your pup!"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best place to stop in Charlotte for a quick breakfast or lunch bagel. The staff is always super friendly, always a clean atmosphere and great vibe. The menu is huge and has so much great stuff to choose from, so I recommend picking the \"Lottery Bagel\" option where the staff picks their favorite to make for you. Never disappointed when leaving here. Not to mention the owner/manager is the BOMB!

If you're visiting the city or haven't tried this place yet, DO IT!"}
{"text":"Although there is always a line, it is well worth it! And, it just shows how great Owen's is. The bagels are awesome and Ashley, the owner, and the staff are on top of everything and always have a great attitude. 

Love that Owen's will only be a block away after I move this weekend."}
{"text":"Owens is great. The food is always fresh and if you get there early enough you can avoid the long line. I prefer the Angry Steve for a little spice. The service is also always good but expect to wait for your bagels because they usually are busy!"}
{"text":"Bagel bacon egg and cheese with a large cup of fresh brewed coffee is the only reason I'm up before 9am on a Saturday morning! Got to beat the long line that forms quickly at Owen's Bagel & Deli.

The walls are covered in \"local artist\" hand work, staff is friendly and the food literally will cure any hangover. Parking can be a little dicey but it's so worth it. Upon entering is a board to the left that lists all the types of bagels and spreads then grab a menu and wait in line.

Places like this are rare now that Southend is bringing in the new and pushing out the old. We need to support places like Owen's, Common Market, Phat Burrito that not only remind us of what makes charlotte so awesome, but what keeps up coming back for more."}
{"text":"I love Owen's bagels. Interesting and creative bagel sandwiches on top of really yummy bagels. Sure, they have \"plain\" but who wants a plain bagel when you can have onion or garlic or everything?

It was a late start on Sunday for us, landing at Owen's at 1:30 in the afternoon. A little sad to see that they had already run out of coffee, but we were satisfied to find a Dr. Brown's cream soda in the fridge.

Excellent salmon on a bagel with capers for Mrs. K. A lovely bagel with egg and cheese and ham for me. Delish. Just sad about the coffee."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place- im from out of town. I had the psychadeli bagel and it was delicious! I wish we had this spot where I live. Everyone's so friendly and it's hard to be anything but happy in this atmosphere- great choice of music too. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love Owen's Bagels.
Have only been here a limited number of times, why? How dare I deprive myself of deliciousness?

This time I got the Reuben bagel, pretty good but I was overcome with jealousy when my fiance asked for the workers to surprise him..

Ashley (Owen's employee) made what she calls \"A nice piece of Ash\" her signature bagel, IT WAS AMAZING!

Thick slices of meat and bacon, sprouts and some other ingredients that made me super jelly!


I will be back and hope Ashley will be there so I can get a piece of that!"}
{"text":"This is a convenient spot for me, whenever I finished getting my nails done, I will hop over to get a blueberry bagel.  I've also tried their breakfast bagel, they are super delicious as well.  Highly recommended!

I also show them my phone one time for qualifying the FREE soft drink for frequent check-ins and I don't know any other shop owner will make that exception, they usually ask you to print out what you have on your phone or give them some coupon in print, but I like it when they are flexible and I would definitely come back for more whenever I crave for breakfast or bagels!!!"}
{"text":"We had to check out all the hype a couple of days ago. I wish I would have known you can call your order in for pick up, the line was gnarly. Luckily, Owen's is pretty festive with plenty of things to look and read. I ordered the Grubby Bubby on an Everything Bagel and added jalapeno CC (per yelper's suggestion) while the boyfriend got the Mayberry Captain Midnight. I paid about $13 altogether. It took a little to come out since it was crowded, but I appreciate the fact that they call out the orders exactly how they are placed to avoid mix-ups. The Grubby Bubby came out huge compared to the MCM, the bialy bagel is pretty slim. The chicken salad on the MCM had good flavor but the chicken was overcooked and dry. The Grubby Bubby came out amazing as expected. The added jalapeno cream cheese is so worth it. 

I will be back to try out more bagel sandwiches but I'll be placing my order via phone for easy pick up. Cheers!"}
{"text":"A good bagel sandwich starts with a good bagel. I love Owens because they sell a quality product. I used to get their signature recipes every time but I have started just making up my own recipes of combos that I like for breakfast or lunch. The great think about Owens is the have lots of vegan and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich in Charlotte by far. Good service, great atmosphere and the Phish sandwich will have you back again and again."}
{"text":"Best bagel sandwich ever! The selection is great. The line tells it all, but it moves fast. The staff is very friendly.  If you are in Charlotte, have a bite here. You won't leave hungry, but you will leave happy!"}
{"text":"The steamed bagel sandwiches and coffee are great.  There is a ton of menu variety, but just avoid the bacon, as it is always chewy and never crisp."}
{"text":"So Scrumptious, but whoooooa busy!!

The food is amazing, but there is always so many people there! Their staff has it down for getting orders in, but with how many orders they take - it does take time. 

Best tip about this place: there is outdoor seating"}
{"text":"I popped in here for the first time with my boyfriend this weekend - we went to school at Miami University so we had to check out the place that was based off the original we loved!

I got the Gwacka Flocka Flame, which I loved - it was meaty and creamy and spicy and just perfect. My boyfriend got the Nice Piece of Ash, and while he liked it he said he'd had much better. Hands down the best bagels I have found since moving to Charlotte though!

The restaurant space itself is like 4x the size of the one in Oxford which is nice, but it was also SO much slower than we were used to (but equally as busy). Chances are we will be back, but it's hard to give them an over-the-top review when comparing to the original."}
{"text":"Solid spot where they steam their bagels / sandwiches. Crowds and line can be a pain, but that's a testament to their food. Parking needs to be improved to make this spot a daily go to."}
{"text":"Food is great. Place is way too hipster for the angry curmudgeon I have become. Go and enjoy the bright-eyed youth until life drains the color from their fresh, happy faces."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. The staff is always friendly, the atmosphere is always like a party.
Some tips get there early and know what you want to order to help keep the line moving...I haven't had a bad sandwich from here yet...Hangover Helper for the win!!!!"}
{"text":"The best bagel sandwiches in town. I LOVE steamed bagels and Owens does not disappoint. A ton of different options on the menu and you can modify anything. I was born in Wheeling, WV so when I saw the Dicarlo's pizza bagel I had to get it. Delicious."}
{"text":"You will wait (if you don't call ahead), but it will be worth it. With that being said.. call your order in before you go. They usually have a separate line where you can pickup call ahead orders too. If they don't pick up the first time you try calling, call again.

While there are plenty of options, I tend to go the traditional bacon, egg and cheese route. With pimento cheese, of course.

Check in on Yelp for a free fountain beverage! They do also have a frequent buyer card that you after you buy 10, you get one free. 

Seating is fairly limited, and with how many people are usually waiting, I prefer to just order to go. However, there are about 10-15 tables if you can snag one and don't mind people standing around you while you eat. You will be too enthralled by your sandwich to really even notice.

Was a little confusing the first time figuring out how to get inside. They are located in a multi-tenant building, so you will need to walk into the establishment's main doors, and will then see the entrance to Owen's on your right."}
{"text":"So glad Owen's is back up and running after being closed for some time (kitchen fire? - Now I'm just spreading gossip).  What is NOT gossip are how good their steamed bagel sandwiches are here.

Located in an unassuming end of a shopping center right off of South Blvd, you can easily miss this place if you are zooming down the road.  Once you find parking (usually in the back) you can go in, get your bearings.  They share space in the Pavilion in South End, so once you navigate to their side of the Pavillion, grab a menu (that's rather large and in charge) and calmly wait in line.  They have a bunch of stuff to look at while you are in line.  Their menu offerings - I call it artwork, but I am thinking the artwork is contributed by the tireless and hardworking staff at Owens.

The Hangover Helper has worked miracles for me, but really everything on their menu is amazing.  They have something for everyone too - breakfast person, non-meat eating person, bacon person, it's a smorgasbord of deliciousness when you come here.

Definitely a great GEM in the South End Community.... Owens is changing the world \"one bagel at a time\" like their motto suggests."}
{"text":"Since I pledged to support local for a whole month I took a detour from my usual stops at those chain bagel places to check out Owen's.

Owen's sits inside the Pavillion which is across South Blvd from Atherton Mill.  It's a funly place with eclectic decor from sports pennants to chalkboard signs.  Their menu is quite extensive of breakfast and deli sandwiches and they feature Boar's Head deli meats.

I ordered the Hangover Helper bagel sandwich which consisted of ham, egg and smoked gouda cheese.  Just the smell of the smoked gouda told me I was about to have a Foodgasm.  The bagel itself was soft, the ham was stuffed on it and the gouda...mmmmmmmmmm.  One of my favorite cheeses.  

The staff is very friendly here.  There's plenty of tables in the space and fountain drinks are help yourself.  

You definite get your money's worth here."}
{"text":"Delicious bagel, but soft on the outside because they steam them.  I enjoyed an egg, turkey sausage, and cheddar cheese sandwich on an everything bagel.  The cheddar cheese was perfectly melted.  While I love the sandwich, I prefer my bagels to be crunchy on the outside and soft inside. But, I will go back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of this place, although I was only here once for lunch.

Parking here can be a bit tight, but the interior of this bagel shop is fairly spacious.  Somehow, the atmosphere on the particular afternoon I visited stressed me out.  A family with two screaming kids, spilling things on the floor.  The employees appeared to be squabbling over something or other and loudly calling out ingredients that they needed.  The layout is also a bit confusing with menus on one end, payment on the other that was opposite to guest traffic.  The staff on this day was a bit surly.

I did like the open, industrial vibe with writing on the walls and a variety of news magazine covers on the walls.

The lunch bagels have fun names and neat meat and veggie combinations.  I had a turkey, avocado, bacon and cheese bagel.  Steamed bagels are a strange concept for me.  I'm not a fan.  Bagels packed To Go will steam on their own in the wrapper, so why steam them to start?  All in all, I guess I like my bagels toasted and to eat them in a relaxing environment.  It's a matter of preference."}
{"text":"So happy I found this little gem. If you are the least bit hungover, these bagel sandwiches will literally save you. Very casual atmoshere- one thing to note, they steam their bagels (no toasting)...When I first learned this I was weary but they are delicious! Oh and the bagels come straight from NY. Try and get there on the early side because they run out of the good bagels (everything) quick on weekends. This has shattered my world on many occasions."}
{"text":"Awesome local bagel shop with a massive menu. I had a basic bacon, egg and cheese and it was much better than anything you'd get at Brueggers. Even the simple bagel/cream cheese was awesome. I can't believe I've never been here but I can't wait to go back."}
