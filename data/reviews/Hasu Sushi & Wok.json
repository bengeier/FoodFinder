{"text":"I am a big ayce sushi fan, basically tried most on town and i have to say i was pleasantly surprised by this place!   We went on a thursday night, when they have their promo of 50% on women (for each pair) and made a reservation for 7 oclock. We were running late so i called back to advise them so, and they were really nice about it, said to take our time and the table would be ready when we get there. I thought, oh it must be quiet then, i got there and the place was packed! And as promised, table was ready when we got there.   The fact that its a BYOW is definitely a win, most AYCE don't have this option, and the SAQ is literally across the street.   Service was quick, again, surprising for a AYCE and the sushi were good! My favorite was definitely the beef tataki, thick slices and so tasty - not frozen like other AYCE. Sashimi were also thick slices and tasted so fresh! I also really loved their soups. We didn't get much of wok plates and stir fries, but i saw a lot of tables around ordering and re-ordering, therefore im guessing its good!   I will definetly go back and bring along friends and family :)"}
{"text":"Hasu is basically Sato & Chan being rehashed into an Asian fusion themed resto that now caters to its patrons with Sushi & Wok plates instead of the AYCE Asian variety.   I came here for lunch and here are my notes.  - A lot of options are typical Quebec stir-fry (ex: General Tao).   - Lunch menu consists of a small soup and your main dish for about $12.  - Very aesthetic pleasing place which contrasts sharply with the nasty menus we received. For a new resto the menus we got certainly were filthy and left us a bad impression. Our table wasn't very clean as well. This left us apprehensive about the condition of the kitchen. If they couldn't be honest with us at the table with these issues we could see, who knows what's going on back there,  - Service was mediocre Food was served after maybe 15 minutes. It would have been nice to get a refill and if they let is finish our soups...  - I went with the orange beef, veggies and rice. It came with a tiny spring roll with no sauce? Everything was forgettable except the orange beef. It was quite good, at least for me.  - They gave no real utensils to eat with beyond plastic chop sticks. Seriously.... slippery plastic chopsticks. The rice didn't even stick to it. They were useless.  I guess I might come back to give them another change, time will tell."}
{"text":"I had my doubts about this place after taking one look at this building. It is a typical suburban all-you-can-eat sushi and basically has all other Asian dishes you can think of on a separate menu, with over-the-top decor.   This is strictly for their dinner time AYCE sushi. I was actually pretty impressed by how fresh the sashimi/sushi were, by the ratio of fish to rice (it's still a lot of rice, but this is AYCE, so I have lower expectations), and how quick and efficient the service was. I actually prefer this place for AYCE sushi than the ones in downtown Montreal.  If you're ever in Laval and you want sushi... I suggest this place. Every other sushi place I suspect will be of similar quality but for a higher price point. At least here you can pick and choose."}
