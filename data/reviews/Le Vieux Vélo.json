{"text":"Perfect simple breakfast. I had the classic eggs Benedict with home fries. The hollandaise was excellent, the ham was thick cut and tasty. The poached eggs were near perfect - slightly over done.   Friendly staff and casual diner atmosphere with a French Canadian edge."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious BAB Benny. Are you kidding me? Brie/Avo/Bacon Eggs Benedict? Great atmosphere, great music, gently attentive staff, yassss coffeeeeeeeee. I was inspired by the shelf of preserves next to my table. The only issue is that the wait is crazy long unless you go on a weekday!"}
{"text":"Plat simple mais qui fait très bien l'affaire.  Beaucoup de bruit mais on aime ça.  Service très efficace et abordable.  Un must pour ceux et celles qui aiment les ufs bénédictines."}
{"text":"Packed out on a Saturday, but we managed to grab a couple of spots at the bar to eat. Fiancé ordered l'Atlantique while I had le Standard. Both great, but the stand out item which funnily enough no one mentions was the bread that comes with le Standard. Gorgeous! Perfectly toasted with just the right amount of butter too. I devoured my plate and recommend it even above the famous eggs benedict!"}
{"text":"This is the ultimate in a contemporary diner. It's the kind of place you want to go and spend your morning. The coffee is quite delicious (no more weak diner coffee!) and the atmosphere is awesome with lots of painted reclaimed school chairs and old school pyrex mugs.   The food is delicious, carefully presented, and the perfect amount. The toast is exquisite.   I wish there was a place like this where I live... I would go here all the time."}
{"text":"Beau, bon, pas cher.. Petit resto sans prétention au décor très simple. Menu très simple et court. Les meilleurs oeufs bénédictine à montréal! Le café au lait est dans les meilleurs que j'ai bu également. Les patates qui accompagne les plats sont malheureusement décevante une fois sur deux.. Mais pour le prix des oeufs béné qui est super bas.. On ne s'en plaint pas!"}
{"text":"A very simple diner type breakfast joint with great food. Walked right in on a Saturday morning and were seated right away. Their menu features a variety of delicious Eggs Benedict dishes. Staff were super friendly and our meal was very affordable. I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Le Vieux Vélo is a great breakfast spot. Be prepared to wait a good half hour for a table on the weekend, but it's worth it. It's cosy and cute inside and the Brie avocado bacon sandwich is great! The prices are reasonable and it's one of those places that you can tell care about the dishes they are putting out. That's important to me. They won't rip you off. Delicious choose-what-you-want-inside smoothies are available but sadly their juice selection is but tropicana. The Benedicts are also yummy and the hollandaise is rich and citusy. Will keep on coming back!"}
{"text":"Food: A very small menu but a variety of items that can easily satisfy everyone. The food came to the table hot, it was tasty and the potato wedges are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside which was perfect.    Service: The staff was nice and attentive despite the place being busy.  Value: Inexpensive  Ambiance: Located in a lovely neighborhood, always a line-up on weekends! Cozy inside, feels like walking into someone's home. The downside that it's fairly small so you may feel cramped up."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast place.    Food is good and made with love. The service is friendly and prompt.  The place is small and hipster as hell but its pretty much the best breakfast place in the area."}
{"text":"Holy cow!  Best eggs benedict ive ever had in my life! We ordered the B.A.B. (Bacon avocado brie) as well as the spinach and ham eggs benedict.   Both were perfect made and the portions were just right. Best meal i have had so far in montreal!  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Mon restaurant déjeuner favori dans le coin! Les oeufs bénédictines sont savoureux. Par contre, l'endroit est plutôt petit et le menu plutôt limité."}
{"text":"I must preface this that I have never had eggs benny before. I know, right?! I love brunching, but for some reason never thought to have it. I always assumed I would hate the heaviness of Hollandaise sauce. It's also totally outside my taste palate and Eastern European up bringing. Well, this was the place to go to try it for the first time: HELLO EGGS BENNY! I think I know why people love you. My friend who brought me has had them many times, and has lived in England, etc etc, said they were delicious too.  I'm gluten free and our polite waiter said that even though they come on an English muffin they make potato pancakes that they can sit the eggs on top of. Perfect! The poached egg was the right consistency, the smoked salmon wasn't stale tasting, the cream cheese texture and flavour was just right.  The potatoes on the side were crispy on the outside and warm and mushy on the inside. The few slices of tomato was also a perfect addition, and they didn't taste like water (and it's early Feb!) like most resto tomatoes do, especially in the winter.  The green tea was weak but at least it had free refills.  The staff was nice and attentive, and after weekend brunch rush settled, we were able to do work on our laptops using their free wifi.  I am going back, for sure! It's also a quick 7-8 minute walk from Baubien metro."}
{"text":"I am continuing my running series on brunch, which I've recently embraced, with fork and knife! I reallllly liked this place! That really nice combo of good prices + great atmosphere. I had the eggs benny with smoked salmon and it made my heart sing. All the plates were well-sized and the wait staff were v pleasant :). We went on that first Saturday on the year when one might actually freeze their balls off. The waiter suggested us to have a coffee at the cafe next door until our table was ready (about 30-40 min wait at 11am). Take them up on this suggestion!! - I think that is prob a win win (win), for you, your appendages, and the cafe next door, especially in the coming season!"}
{"text":"Le Vieux Vélo is my favourite brunch spot in Little Italy, serving up the best eggs benedict in the city! The BAB (bacon, avocado, brie) MUST be tried.They tend to be packed on the weekend after 11am but the wait times have improved since they expanded. There are also benches outside and the same owners (who are adorable) recently opened an amazing coffee joint right next door-- Odessa. By the time you finish your latte your table will be ready. If you're eating gluten-free, like me, you can ask for your benedict to be served on a potato patty instead of the english muffin. A total Montreal gem! :)"}
{"text":"My all-time favourite eggs benedict place!! They also have delicious coffee!  Non-pretentious, very down to earth atmosphere. It's a little small which is great for the atmosphere but you might end up waiting a while for a table. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés bruncher hier au vieu vélo, très très déçus La serveuse très désagréable, la nourriture pas bonne du tout.les patates étaient durs et trop sales Les french toast dégueulasse, mon tchum a été malade toute la journée Bref on y retournera jamais et je le déconseille"}
{"text":"We got BAB and latte. BAB was delicious especially w hot sauce. My husband was very impressed by their latte that he ended drinking two cups. Will return in future"}
{"text":"The BAB is delicious! Also had the champagne cocktail, highly recommend it. Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"This place is DANGEROUSLY AWESOME! The best Eggs Benedict in town, the real Benedict sauce and not the crappy fake one often restaurant serve you.   The BAB is my best (bacon, avocado, brie), but the smoked salmon or the pesto taste as good. And.... not expensive at all, it can go up to $9.50 which is a pretty good price for Montreal. And the coffee is also very good, very tasty :)  It's a small and cozy place, no reservation so you might wait a little but it's worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Un endroit qui fait pauvre dans la deco mais les oeufs benedictines sont delicieux. Il me semble que cela demandrait un petit effort de decoration et de mobilier et ca pourrait rendre ca plus chaleureux"}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is a must try!   Excellent food and great service ... just visiting Montreal from Toronto ... but I'd take the drive to have this experience again ... order the BAB ... we need more restaurants like this"}
{"text":"Agree that these are some of the best eggs benedict ever in the whole world. Great service, lovely atmosphere, and wonderful food. Our server was so kind and attentive, and even very thoughtful of our 2-year old son. Please go here. It is a great place!"}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp and OMG EVERYONE SHOULD COME HERE. Or at least, everyone who likes a lovely environment with incredibly, fresh-tasting, well-seasoned, thoughtful-but-not-pretentious food, and friendly, attentive-but-not-pushy service.   I ordered the Brie, Avocado, and Bacon eggs benedict without bacon (I'm veg) and no muffin (gluten-sensitive) and the server helpfully suggested that I order something else instead -- I can't remember the name of it now -- it's two eggs any style + salad + beans + potatoes, and just add avocado. I got the eggs poached, with hollandaise on the side. The meal was perfect. The eggs were poached how I like them (firm, still runny inside, but beginning to set, and and no runniness on the whites), the potatoes were the best I've had in years (most restaurants undercook their breakfast potatoes; these were crisp or chewy on the outside, and melty soft on the inside, and tasted like they'd been cooked in high quality butter), the beans were a nice small addition, the salad was not underdressed (most are, in my opinion), the hollandaise sauce was light and fresh ... I had fresh-squeezed OJ, also yummy.   The servers were polite and helpful and just NICE. Hope this place continues to thrive."}
{"text":"A lovely neighbourhood brunch place for weekdays. The lineup is way too long over the weekends!  Had the vegetarian chilli which was filling and delicious! Glorious lattes as well. Unfortunately, the curtains around the door Don't really block the crazy wind so we did end up getting a little cold but I can't really blame them for the weather now can I?"}
{"text":"It took a little time before we were sitting but once we did everything was perfect. We ordered the BAB eggs Benedict and it was so good. A perfect blend of taste from the bacon cheese and finally the crispness of the English muffin. Service was very good friendly and prompt. Would definitely recommend and will come back again."}
{"text":"Bel endroit pour un brunch. Bonnes assiettes, belles portions. Hipster mais on aime !! ;)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I'm not a huge fan of eggs Benedict....until I tried them Le Vieux Velo on fellow yelper Risa D.'s recommendation.   The place is tiny and we were prepared to wait but were pleasantly surprised when an expected 45minute wait turned out to be a 25minute wait.   The place is tiny and no frills with very chill staff, cute vintage coffee cups and a solid and affordable menu.  I ordered the eggs Benedict Florentine and was not disappointed. They were delicious and the portion size was perfect; enough to feel full but not stuffed.  I will definitely be back to work my way through the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"This review is not only reflective of the amazing food and experience at this wonderful, little, cozy restaurant, but it is also a gift back to the Yelp community. The result of arriving at the restaurant and having a good experience was because of my typical Yelp search and the great reviews shared by my fellow Yelpers...so thank you Yelp community! :)  Onto the restaurant. Amazing food! And Amazing food! I had the L'Atlantique (pictured), and the sauce, eggs, capers, smoked salmon, homemade potatoes... everything was perfect. My brother had a chicken sandwich with a curry-type sauce that was wow! My sister-in-law had a similar dish to mine but with really good jambon (ham). They shared some \"brunch\" cocktails (why not, right?) that were also good. Great and attentive service, very informal and enjoyable space and patrons.   Oh, I will be back!"}
{"text":"After a night of partying, there is no other Place you want to go to for your bunch, between food, drinks and service you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this breakfast joint. Great basic bacon and eggs breakfast (bacon and sausage are from the butcher across the street, but I'm not a raving about their quality - just alright) BUT, I dream about their BAB eggs benedict. Its a combo of brie, avocado and bacon with 2 perfectly poached eggs. I haven't had one better. Sweet service and cute decor. One of my faves."}
{"text":"Friendly, calm & delicious. Great hollandaise sauce & perfect poached eggs for 6 types of Eggs Benny. French toast was served with a sprinkling of granola. Bright, airy space, crowded on a Saturday morning, but we got in without waiting and the folks who came after us looked happy waiting on the sidewalk. Service was attentive without being pushy or hovering."}
{"text":"Outstanding Breakfast. Eggs Benedict is there specialty. I had le BAB. Bacon, Avocado and Brie. My parter had le Florentine.  Both were amazing. Service was excellent, waters and coffees refill without asking.   Small detail. They are not licensed to sell alcohol so no ceasers with breakfast for you!    Highly Recommend"}
{"text":"Bon petit brunch dont la spécialité est le bénédictine.. Très bon, mais quantité un peu faible pour un brunch... Choix peu diversifié! On aime quand même"}
{"text":"Best eggs benedict in Montreal! Came here and waited in in just to see what all the hype was about the eggs benedict they serve here. I was pleasantly surprised to see it was just 9$ as usually it's more like 14$ here in Montreal. I ordered the classic one with ham and cheese and my girlfriend opted to try the bacon, avacodo and swiss cheese one. It came with potatoes and a small side of salad. The eggs benedict was out of this f*cking world!!! The hollandaise sauce was slightly bitter yet buttery and lemony and tasted so fresh, the eggs were poached to perfection as well as every other ingredient. The potatoes tasted like no potatoes I've ever had before. My girlfriend asked me \"are we in heaven?\" and I told her I wasn't sure but it feels like it. Even the salad tasted amazing, and I usually don't even like salad!"}
{"text":"J'aurais voulu mettre 3,5 étoiles : parce que le temps d'attente est vraiment long entre le temps d'être placé puis celui d'être servi.  Par contre le personnel est très sympa, la nourriture est très bonne, pas très chère. Pas très chère mais logique je trouve, dans le sens où la quantité n'est pas très importante à mon goût..."}
{"text":"Best place for eggs Benedict. Plate is the perfect size and everything is good. Homemade Hollandaise sauce, service is fast. The only problem is the wait to get inside during the weekends. You have to get up early if you don't want to wait. But also worth the wait."}
{"text":"Such an amazing experience, the atmosphere was so chill, the music in was great and the food was even better!! Plus the prices were really great too, if I ever come back to Montreal I will definitely be stopping by for breakfast :)"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Its less than a block from my place (dAnGeRoUS!) and I have been many many times. Great eggs benedict of course. I often switch the potatoes for salad (I prefer a lighter meal, unless I'm hungover, in which case bring on the potatoes!), and they have always been super chill about it. Good coffee!   I always go here when I have guests in town. The longest I've waited was maybe 20 minutes at the height of brunch time on a Sunday (I think it was noon or 1pm). It's always packed (I've walked by on a Tuesday at 11am and the place was still at least half full), and sure as hell beats many places in the Mile End in terms of quality, price, and service. Plus great artwork on the walls. If you are in Rosemont/Little Italy, and want some eggs, go here for breakfast. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Over the last few months I've been searching for the \"perfect\" place that prepares the \"perfect\" eggs Benedict. Look no further, Le Vieux Velo is perfection in every single bite.  The place it's self may not say much from the inside or outside, don't let that turn you away from trying their nine different varieties of eggs Benedict.   They do everything eggstremely well, and delicious. For those that do not desire to have eggs benedict, there are a few other choices on the menu to choose from. For myself, I chose the granola french toast. Oh my! Three lovely generous slices of bread, lightly dipped in a eggy batter. Finally sprinkled with a generous amount of granola, fresh berries, bananas, and a wonderful creamy yogurt. Outstanding!   As for the eggs benedict, we chose the one with salmon. Great English muffins(2), with a delicious and generous slice of smoked salmon, followed by two perfectly poached eggs and a silky, homemade hollandaise sauce.   With such wonderful words, why only four stars? Unforunately our meal was served in very cold plates, and the food it's self was not too hot. It was simply warm. Quite disappointing when French toast and eggs benedict cannot be warmed up without ruining their texture and flavour.   As for the ambiance.. Simple and lovely. Nothing fancy about it. Very casual with a touch of hipster. A few decorations here, and there. Tables and chairs look the same as the ones we had in school back in time. Ok, not that long ago! C'mon now. I'm not that old. No, I won't reveal my age.   Overall, I was pleased with everything. I would certainly come back again, and again. Hopefully the food would be serve at a much warmer temperature than my first time.   A little side note for those that will be driving. Parking quite challenging as many spots are reserved for the residential areas. The few spots that are available, are quickly taken during the weekend after 9:00am. I strongly suggest you arrive at Le Vieux Velo before 9:30am(They open at 9:00am)"}
{"text":"Les meilleurs ufs bénédictines en ville. Mes favoris sont brie, bacon et avocats mais les ayant tous essayés je vous garantis qu'ils sont tous bons. Le décor assez simple mais charmant avec des expositions qui changent au fil du temps pourrait avoir l'air hipster pour certains, moi j'aime! Le cafe latté est savoureux et crémeux à souhait, je sais que plusieurs bons cafés sont à proximité mais le Vieux vélo est even better. Et le prix! On adore. Des déjeuners a 10-12$ et cafés à 2$, on s'en sort en bas de 20$. Évidemment l'endroit est populaire le weekend mais habituellement le roulement est bon. On y retourne encore et encore!"}
{"text":"Cute, simple, good food, inexpensive.   Had the BAB Benedict and asked to replace the bacon for salmon. They did it at no hassle no extra charge. Awesome!!! It had such a good feel with the avocado and the salmon. The colors were kinda cool too, yellow, green, orange."}
{"text":"If there is brunch in Heaven (and I hope there is...), they surely serve bacon, avocado, brie eggs Benedict from Le Vieux Vélo. Oh, and Odessa lattés. Yes, yes, I know I'm not supposed to eat dairy. But once in a while I have a dairy splurge, knowing I'll pay the price afterwards. It was worth every bite."}
{"text":"C'est assez facile d'accès sur l'artère Beaubien E. On y mange sur le pouce, mais on y mange très bien. Le sandwich à l'avocat et au bacon est splendide. Si vous avez besoin de wifi pour travailler un peu, vous serez satisfait."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée un jour de semaine avec des amies pour déjeuner. Nous étions pratiquement seules dans le café. Nos oeufs bénédictines ont été servis en moins de 10 minutes! Les plats sont classiques mais bien faits. Le café est également bon.   L'ambiance est décontractée et c'est certainement une place où j'irais plus souvent si j'habitais dans le coin de Beaubien."}
{"text":"What an amazing find! Had one of the best brunch experiences. A simple brunch and espresso place, not pretentious, and unbeatable prices. Love the whole vibe of the place, casual and cozy, with pink tables and pastel walls. The server is really nice and friendly. The egg benedicts here are amazing! I tried the spinach Benedict, the hollandaise sauce was light and fluffy. Comes with a side of potatoes and salad. The proportions are just perfect, doesn't leave you feeling too stuffed. Best part is, the benefits are about $11. They also serve brunch on weekdays: a definite favourite!"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch spot when in Montreal! There was a bit of a wait so we went to the next door coffee shop and were then picked up there when our table was free. The coffee was fantastic and the French toast as well as the salmon bagel were fresh and filling! The atmosphere is lively and bright and the waitstaff is incredibly friendly!"}
{"text":"Came here because another restaurant nearby was closed. Didn't expect much but turned out to be awesome. The bacon avocado benedict egg was so flavorful and the muffin was so crispy. The potatoes are also very good.   Service was quick and waiter was friendly.   Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to have brunch today. The service was good but I think the food could be better. I ordered le Marin. There was a huge amount of butter sitting on one of the bread, which is..... quite surprising. The salad I think has some ginger in it which I don't really like. My friend ordered the classic Benedict eggs. I think he likes it. I tried some of his potatoes. They were too salty, but my friend finished it quite happily. One thing is that they do not have omelettes on the menu.  But I would say I still like it. It's cheap and I like how they decorate the restaurant."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the florentine eggs Benedict served with potatoes and salad. It is served in perfect portions. I was pleasantly surprised with the price. The staff were also very friendly. I will definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"Des saveurs bien marié. Des portions à votre goût sur demande. Bruillant mais pas envaissant. J'ai hate d'y retourner pour gouter autre chose."}
{"text":"A big fan of the BAB. And I love the deal they have with the coffee shop next door. I come here each time I'm in the neighborhood !"}
{"text":"Le Vieux Velo, in Little Italy, is one of my favourite brunch spots in Montreal (and that says a lot, as there are sooo many amazing places). The decor is simple and their menu is small but they do their items just right.  Their eggs benedicts are delicious - and they have pesto hollandais sauce which is a lot tastier and less heavy than usual hollandais sauce in my opinion. I've tried both the BAB (Bacon, Avocado, and Brie) and their Veggie Pesto Benedicts. Their benedicts are priced at ~ 9$-11$ which is probably the best you'll find in Montreal.   This place does get pretty busy on the weekends but their service is fast and I've never had to wait more than ~20 minutes. Next door is Cafe Odessa so I usually just hop over there for coffee while I wait. Vieux Velo serves brunch all day so you can go later to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"When I visited Montreal a friend took us out to this place for brunch one day. It was quiet with no wait, but we were there on a weekday around 9:30am. The decor and tables are basic, nothing fancy, but comfortable.   There is a straight forward menu with lots of variations on brunch classics like eggs benedict. I went with the BAB (bacon, avocado and brie) eggs benedict. It was very good, but lacked seasoning which was easy to fix with some salt and pepper. The hollandaise sauce was perfect which makes or breaks a dish like this. The potatoes were the right mix of crispy outside and soft inside. My coffee was nothing special, and very strong, but they have fancy coffees as well.   Overall, I'd go back a again. Simple, well executed fresh food. The service was good and fast and the price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Petit restaurent décontracter, atmosphère agréable et relax, décore original de récupération, personnels sympathique. Bonne présentation des assiettes, très bon smooties onctueux avec avocat (ont ne s'en aperçoit même pas qu'il y a de l'avocat pour les craintifs ;) ), effectivement, je ne peut que aller vers l'opinion global; les uf pocher sont vraiment bon et bien fait!! c'est très rare de trouver un endroit ou l'ont est satisfaits des ufs pocher je suis agréablement surprise...et  en pour la quantité, c'est équilibrer,  peut nous sembler en manquer mais non, c'est juste parfait a mon étonnement..juste asser de tout."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Highly recommend the B.A.B.! Great spot for breakfast and brunch and it's pretty affordable."}
{"text":"The greatest eggs Benedict, no matter which one you order!  There's several choices between different benedicts plates depending on your preferences.  The potatoes were crispy and completely yummy!"}
{"text":"We came here on arrival to Montreal upon recommendation from a friend, and we were not at all disappointed. Hearty portion sizes and a really great vibe. The eggs benedict was amazing: my husband ordered the original and mine had avocado and tomato. Don't forget to order the fresh-squeezed OJ!  Super delicious, and a great brunch spot to kick off our (self-guided) Montreal foodie tour!"}
{"text":"Le Vieux Velo seriously nailed every expectation I had.   On both occasions I had gone, it was a busy Sunday brunch hour, and of course a little bit of a wait was to be expected. However, that never lasted more than 20-30 minutes. To make that wait pleasant, they send you to Cafe Odessa just next door, where you can order a coffee or tea and keep warm until someone from Le Vieux Velo comes to get you when your table is ready. It's a pretty genius idea actually, and the collaboration between the two establishments most definitely assists in each of their sales.  Once you're in and seated, you'll notice it's a little bit cramped up, but they make due with what they have. The menu is fairly simple to make your way through. As soon as I saw their eggs benedict, it was a no brainer that that's what I was going to order. I stand by the notion that if I can make something equally as good at home, I won't order it at a restaurant. So I'll always go for what I'm incapable of making myself! The B.A.B. had my name all over it, I already knew this before I even got in.   It was mind blowingly phenomenal and tasteful. Until today, I'm still raving about it, and I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Still a solid option, now tried the for lunch rush.  No frills burger, no fancy topping, comes with breakfast potatoes instead of fries.  They don't server Coke here, just Pepsi, so without a real soft drink , could not get the whole burger experience :)  The menu still hasn't changed much in all these years."}
{"text":"Je suis un addict de leur Bacon-Avocat-Brie.   Arrivez juste avant 11h si vous voulez éviter le line-up du brunch le dimanche matin :)"}
{"text":"Charmant petit endroit pour un café( lait d'amande/soya disponibles!)  ou un déjeuner. Les oeufs bénédictines sont bons et un menu végé est offert également!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've ever had in Montreal. I went with the florentine and enjoyed my meal bite after bite. Even the coffee was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was perfect for a late lunch and coffee.  The BBLAT and soup were delicious, and it really helped take the chill off from the snowy weather!  Very friendly barista and server, and just an overall positive experience."}
{"text":"Très réputé pour ses brunchs, le Vieux Vélo a une réputation d'enfer et pour cause! Ses brunchs sont vraiment délicieux et à des prix vraiment très abordables! Les jus aussi sont bons Seul hic: il y a souvent un long line up, même l'hiver... attendez vous à attendre au moins 30mn.. par contre, il y a un petit café juste à côté, dans lequel vous pouvez attendre en prenant un café et les serveurs du Vieux Vélo viennent vous chercher quand votre table est prête! vraiment intéressant :)"}
{"text":"Omgggg... Words cannot describe how freaking amazing the food was!!!!!! I order the Atlantic and let me tell you... I never had eggs Benedict before, I usually get scrambled eggs. But what I ordered was sooooooooooooooo amzinggggg like yummy yum yum!!!! It was soooo creamy and sooooo delicious! I finished it all. Once you had one bite, you don't wanna stop eating! Trust me! And the salmon... Oh myyyyyy Atlanta! Soooo good! You definitely gotta try this place out!!!! You won't regret it! Trust!!!!"}
{"text":"On est allé là à 10 personnes pour le brunch, et tout le monde à bien aimé leurs plats et le service, très sympathique et efficace (pour moi ufs bénédictine au saumon fumé et cappuccino - tout était parfait). Excellent rapport qualité prix - on va revenir c'est sûr !!"}
{"text":"Always excellent, awesome brunch option in that neighbourhood. Best eggs Benedict in mtl, especially the ones with the crispy bacon.  The service is great, prices super reasonable.  There is always a bit of a lineup on weekends but never longer than 15mins. To avoid the rush come around 1:30 or 2pm. Great lunch options as well, salads sandwiches and burgers."}
{"text":"Best Benedict I've ever had and I'm usually a scramble eggs usually!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a breakfast place and fell on reviews of this place so i decided to give it a try. It's a quaint Iittle restaurant that has Eggs Benedict as the star of the menu. Following recommendations of fellow yelpers I had the B.A.B (bacon,avocado,brie) Benedict on potatoes since i can't have bread. It was absolutely delicious, how can it not be?! Highly recommend this place and will surely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great and the service too. My friend and I got Benedict eggs, the fresh orange juice was good and my latte had a cute design. Discovered this place by comments on Yelp, looking for a place close by. Really enjoyed and can go back anytime :)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch in the city. The coffee is amazing, top notch brunch food, the egg benedict are especially delicious. I usually order the filter coffee or an americano and the BAB benedicts, which consist of Bacon, Avocado and brie, topped with a deliciously creamy hollandaise. The potatoes are tasty they have sriracha on every table, which makes ketchup better.  The service is always friendly and efficient and the place looks really cozy. Perfect place to spend a late morning."}
{"text":"What a cute little spot. The locals seem to be lapping this place up. It is among a small number of trendy cafes on the block, and so it was overflowing during the lunch hour. That said, this makes it a less-than-ideal place for spending languid time on your computer, unless you come post lunch rush.  The salads were a bit simple, which is fine if that's what you feel like. The breakfasts were pretty big, but looked amazing. I think this will be my go-to for my next hangover brunch."}
{"text":"I don't really like egg Benedict but this place makes it really good. Very happy we ended up here when the line at L'avenue got so long."}
{"text":"Ce dimanche on brunch au vieux vélo. Quand on arrive devant il y a déjà la ligne mais heureusement ce jour là nous sommes seulement deux!!  Aussitôt arrivés aussitôt installés! Ce petit restaurant de brunch est sans prétentions, la déco discrète et mignonne (petites tables petit endroit) et le rapport qualité prix n'est pas si pire.  J'ai opté pour les oeufs bénédictines B.A.B, un délice, les patates très bonnes aussi mais un peu sèche à mon goût. Mon cheum a pris le standard avec saucisses(très très bonnes les saucisses) il a aimé ça.   Bel endroit à découvrir!"}
{"text":"Nice, no-frills but cute place that's a great option for weekday brunch. We came late on a Monday afternoon, I think, and there was only one other table taken.   I wouldn't say it was the *best* eggs benny I've ever had, but it was very good, and the number of variations they have on the classic is great. There were a few vegetarian options, which is nice. I got the eggs florentine (sans jambon) and my boyfriend got the vege-pesto -- pesto mixed into the hollandaise, over sauteed veggies (peppers? squash? I forget.) It was amazing. My florentine was good, but not amazing.   The home fries were the main area that needed improvement -- they were just not very compelling. Coffee was acceptable. Service was friendly and quick. Art on the walls was excellent!"}
{"text":"The Eggs Benedict dishes of this quaint brunch place are light, in appropriate portion size and delicious all the same. I had the Benedict Veggie Pesto and the hubby had the Benedict Atlantic. The accompanying potatoes are rustic but complement the eggs well.   Try to get to this place before 11 am for weekend brunch because after that, the lineup gets longer!"}
{"text":"Menu modeste mais efficace, on comprend vite que la spécialité ici ce sont les oeufs bénédictines. L'exécution de ce classique, présenté sous d'originales variations, est maîtrisée à la perfection: Une sauce hollandaise jamais trop salée, un moelleux muffin anglais et un oeuf qui cède dès la première pression du couteau, laissant couler une décadente trainée jaune sur notre déjà-appétissante-mais-dorénavant-totalement-indécente assiette.  Servies avec des fruits ou de délicieuses patates déjeuners (elles ne sont pas très assaisonnées, mais grillées à la perfection et puis ça laisse la vedettes aux oeufs!), la portion présentée est parfaite et ça ne goutte pas \"le trop gras\"; on franchit la porte bien satisfait sans regretter d'avoir licher l'assiette jusqu'à la dernière miette. Le café est bien mieux que la plupart des places à déjeuner, un service agréable et une ambiance détendue. Je suis vendue, et vous le serez aussi!"}
{"text":"Plats sans chichi, simples, pas chers. J'adore les oeufs bénédictines au saumon fumé, c'est ce que je prends à presque chaque fois!  L'ambiance est vraiment relaxe, la déco est cute. On sent que le Mile End est en train de s'étendre vers le nord, c'est exactement le genre d'endroit qu'on trouverait sur St-Viateur ou Fairmount.  Seul hic, l'attente (déraisonnable selon moi). Je conseille fortement d'aller attendre au magnifique café Odessa juste à côté, les serveurs de Vieux-Vélo viennent vous chercher lorsqu'une table se libère!"}
{"text":"Endroit avec une belle ambiance, dans un beau quartier! Des portions raisonnables à bons prix; les oeufs bénédictines A.B.A. étaient délicieux!"}
{"text":"Don't dare missing this spot if you like Benedict eggs, they're awesome! Expect a waiting during rush hour."}
{"text":"the food is quite amazing! i had the BAB and it was amazing! must try place.. it is a gem and service was quick. . friendly and  welcoming staff.. location is also a good area. definitely coming back to try the other options in their menu. ."}
{"text":"Mon endroit préféré pour des oeufs bénédictines à Montréal. Prix abordable, service rapide, portions très correctes et option végé, rien à redire si ce n'est qu'il faut venir tôt si l'on ne veut pas faire la file!"}
{"text":"To be exact, I'm giving this place a 2.5 overall. Last day in Montreal and we were looking for a good breakfast place, but the only reason why I left satisfied was because I was full. The only thing that really deserved a great rating was the fact that most of my meal was pretty good.  I ordered the BAB (brie, avocado, bacon) eggs benedict, and I actually liked it. Eggs weren't anything special because their hollandaise mixture was kind of bland to me, but I especially liked the melted brie and the avocado/bacon-to-muffin ratio that accompanied it. The bacon was crisp and my avocado was super green so I'm glad it wasn't sitting out and browning for awhile. The cheese was melted to perfection on the toasted English muffins too! It was large amount of food for me and it seemed to be fitting for its price. However, the water given was for some reason pretty warm...? I wasn't sure if this is custom in Canada since it was the second restaurant we went to that served warm or room-temperature water. We asked for ice and they gave us only a couple of cubes enough for one cup, but it melted within minutes.  Customer service was alright, our waitress seemed unenthusiastic about serving us, but at least she wasn't totally rude. Kind of wish we went to a different place, since it was our last restaurant before heading back home to the States, but at least we met our goal at getting full before the drive!"}
{"text":"As a breakfast/brunch food aficionado, I can say that Le Vieux Vélo takes the cake when it comes to a perfect Eggs Benedict. They offer a variety of different types that are all fairly priced; I want to say that each plate is about $10.50? Also, the staff are very quick on the service aspect and in terms of getting you your food, something that's a bit of a rarity in the easygoing cafe/sometimes restaurant scene of Montréal.  Because I love avocado when it's used properly, I decided to order the Bacon, Avocado and Brie (B.A.B.) Eggs Benedict. I probably didn't wait for more than 10 minutes before everything arrived. Each plate comes with a side of salad and some breakfast potatoes. For a side salad, it was extremely tasty and the vinaigrette/dressing that it was served with was surprisingly light and didn't the fresh taste of the greens away from them. I was also surprised at how well the avocado went with the other ingredients in the main dish - I would've expected them to make the English muffin soggy but instead, it created a layer of creamy goodness. Combined with the salty bacon, soft brie, and the runny yolk, it was a brunch dream made in heaven. The breakfast potatoes carried the perfect balance between crunchiness and a soft center, and they weren't overseasoned or overcooked, which is just how I like them. Overall, it was a divine experience, and I'm looking forward to coming back for more."}
{"text":"small, intimate brunch location near the little Italy area of Montreal.  They have a small menu, but are good at what they do cook. I'm not a fan of eggs Benedict, so they eliminated 75% of the breakfast plates.  My fiance loved his eggs Benedict.  He got the La Florentine version, which included sautéed spinach and chipotle in the sauce.  I had the standard breakfast with sausage.  The potatoes could have used a lot of seasoning.  The toast was good.  Our chai and cappuccinos were served lukewarm - meh."}
{"text":"Nothing special, basic brunch place. I came because of the reviews and it didn't live up to expectations.  Wish they had more potatoes per plate. The one thing that was really good was the ginger dressing in the few pieces of lettuce."}
{"text":"Awesome eggs benedict! The B.A.B. is soooooo good. Definitely go here and have some filtre coffee and eggs. you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Seriously, best eggs benedict EVER! I did a week-long roadtrip from Boston to Montreal, and this place ruined eggs benedict for me for the rest of the trip. It was that good.  They took my favorite brunch food to another level with six different versions of the classic E.B. I had the one with avocado, brie, and bacon. The eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was no joke, the best I have ever tasted. Plus, a good cappuccino and cute atmosphere. Totally would come here all the time if I lived in Montreal."}
{"text":"When I visit a restaurant for the first time, I always order Eggs Benedict for breakfast. If I don't like your Eggs Benedict, I'm probably not going to like much of anything else you make. I've been to lots of restaurants and eaten lots of Eggs Benedict and Le Vieux Vélo is the best I've eaten. No gimmicks, just the classic recipe. Indeed, the menu item is named \"Le Classique\". Order it, savor it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great small place for breakfast or lunch. The lunch menu is smaller than breakfast, but you can should find something without an issue. Nora was friendly and helpful with us, guiding us through the menu.  I got the grilled veggie sandwich with a side salad. This is the first place I have been to where the veggie sandwich actually tastes good. My friends enjoyed their meals of eggs, french toast, and a burger. They had the mimosas and while small, were strong.  Food, service, and presentation were all perfect. It's well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Eggs Benny lovers, happy brunching! Eggs Benny haters, you're at the wrong spot. Simple fare, nothing fancy, good food for a solid price. Baddabingbaddaboom."}
{"text":"Best eggs benedicts ever!!! I had the B.A.B. (brie, avocado, bacon), and it really was cooked to perfection, with the best potatoes on the side. Friendly service with great music. Gonna come here everyday for breakfast! A must try in Montreal."}
{"text":"Ok coffee, retro mug and the benedicts were good, but the potatoes were banal. Staff was cool, service was on point and the window needs some cleaning."}
{"text":"Ce midi brunch au Vieux Vélo !  On avait envie de manger des oeufs bénédictines et nous n'avons pas été déçu ! J'ai pris le BAB (brie-avocat-bacon) qui était vraiment bon. La sauce bien assaisoné, les muffins nickel et tout le reste parfait. Un vrai plaisir avec les patates rissolés qui sont cuites comme il faut, un régale de racler la sauce bénédictine avec :) La portion est correcte et le prix tout doux (moins de 10$). J'ai aussi goûté celui \"végétarien\" avec sauce hollandaise au pesto poivron/oignons. Très bonne sauce et le reste très bien aussi.  Voilà pour la partie salé.  Au niveau de la partie sucré nous avons partagé à 2 l'assiette \"le pain doré\" (en photo) et nous avons finis donc sur une bonne note en dessert. L'assiette est copieuse et le granolat ainsi que le yahourt rajoute un plus à un plat classique mais bien exécuté. J'ai aussi pris un smoothie mais j'ai été un peu décu car je le trouvais light en gout, pas à la hauteur des autres plats mais le niveau étant bon ca n'a en aucun cas gâché mon repas :)  Je recommande donc fortement pour un brunch tranquille avec des plats simples mais bien exécutés et avec en plus une addition light au vue des prix des différents plats !"}
{"text":"Dans le cadre de ma résolution d'essayer des nouveaux endroits pour bruncher, j'ai décidé de commencer par le Vieux Vélo.    Le décor est simple, mignon avec un personnel très sympathique. Ils n'offrent pas pour emporter la fin de semaine, mais ils m'ont quand même accommoder car ce n'était pas trop occupé.    J'ai bien sûr essayé le fameux B\"A \"B, ( brie, avocat, bacon) . L'assiette est belle, les patates excellentes. J'ai trouvé que la portion était parfaite pour moi, mais certains auraient aimer en avoir plus dans l'assiette.   Le thé Earl grey était excellent. J'adore leur présentation: petite tasse vintage, théière et pot de lait.   Mon amie a adoré son plat également , le BAB, mais a trouvé que payer presque 3$ pour un café filtre est un peu cher sachant que c'est souvent inclus dans les déjeuners."}
{"text":"Vraiment charmant comme petit Resto! Ma collègue et moi sommes entrées au Vieux vélo pour un dîner sur le pouce et le service était très rapide et courtois. Nous nous sommes toutes les deux laissées tenter par le BBLAT (Bacon, brie, laitue, avocat, tomates) servi avec une petite salade verte et croyez moi, nous ne l'avons pas regretté.  Mon sandwich était tout simplement délicieux. Le bacon était bien croustillant à souhait et le pain aussi. Je serai de retour pour essayer autre chose sur le menu très bientôt!!"}
{"text":"Les sandwichs comme les oeufs bénédictines sont délicieux!!"}
{"text":"Best eggs Benedict in the entire city Montreal It's hipster it's cozy it's also a guaranteed wait for so worth it. Service is wonderful and to be honest prices are wonderful too ."}
{"text":"I ordered the BAB Benny - Brie, avocado, bacon. Genius. Perfect hollandaise and potatoes too. My boyfriend ordered the French toast, which he described as just the right amount of sweet with a nice combination of fruit.   Service was fast, attentive. Would go again and get that BAB. Uh, so tasty."}
{"text":"Best brunch restaurant in Montréal. Their salmon Eggs Benedict is the best of its kind I've ever had."}
{"text":"So overdue for an update! Over the years I have eaten here a lot and the owners have become friends. The food here is still so tasty and solid and affordable and I love the colour of the new dark grey paint job out front, and the cool light blue on the inside. Important facts: you can do half salad half potatoes, you can do your eggs benny on potatoes instead of bread, and there is sriracha on every table. The basic breakfast is big and if you add sausage they are sooo good. They do not take reservations and there is a line by 10 on the weekends pretty consistently. The staff are all calm, cool and nice. The coffee is pretty great, and you can get excellent coffee at their sister cafe next door and bring it over with you."}
{"text":"All of the options for benedicts is what got me in the door -- the amazing coffee convinced me to stay. LVV is a really unpretentious cozy place to have a bite to eat. It's one of the only restaurants in Montreal that I've been to twice. My only complaint is that I think the food could be better. It's solid but it also feels like if they tried only a little bit harder (or used just slightly higher quality ingredients) they could easily take it to the next level."}
{"text":"Le Vieux Vélo est l'un de ces endroits sans prétention avec un menu beau, bon, pas cher. Le genre d'endroit idéal pour un brunch relax quand t'as une gueule de bois.   Les ufs bénédictine sont excellents - surtout le fameux BAB (brie, avocat, bacon). Il y a habituellement une ligne durant le week-end, mais ce n'est jamais bien long avant d'avoir une table."}
{"text":"We went to this place for brunch because of the excellent reviews on yelp. The Benedict tasted good but not as good as I expected. The BAB one was very special, try it! And good price, and good service. The bus boy advised me that we could order half of a plate when I tried to order French toast and the salmon Benedict. Price was good also."}
{"text":"Had the B.A.B. (bacon avocado brie) eggs benedict. The taste was great and the portion was just enough to finish and not feel stuffed. Coffee here tastes decent. The only disappointment was their OJ. At $4 a glass I was expecting it to at least be 100% pure and not from concentrate, instead it looked more like an orange flavoured drink."}
{"text":"Très bon déjeuner de base pas cher... Mais le café n'est pas inclus. Décor minimaliste. Supplément de fruits frais à 2,50 $ tout petit. La prochaine fois nous essaierons les ufs bénédictines."}
{"text":"The eggs benedict with brie and avocado was delicious!  And was easily adapted to gluten free by serving it on potatoes.  It got crowded by 10 but when we arrived around 9am we could get in right away."}
{"text":"I didn't know eggs benedict could actually be good. Stopped by here on a Saturday morning with my sister and were told it would be a half hour wait. No biggie, wanted to try Odessa anyway. I liked that they let us go next door and would fetch us when our table was ready. Suh-weet.  The wait was actually much shorter-- I'd say 10 minutes.   The place is really tiny. Like a bedroom with a couple of tables and narrow paths. It's small. Some might find this charming, but I like being able to sit comfortably and not have my shoulders bumped every time someone passes by. If we were all 5 years old and having a tea party--cool--maybe then there'd be enough space.   Just like the space, the menu itself is quite small. But I like this, because it means that they make a few things and they should make it damn good. The eggs benedict were a no-brainer to choose since most of the breakfast menu consisted of that. I went with the Florentine Benedict, which was an English muffin topped with ham, spinach, onions (?), and poached eggs. The eggs were covered in this rich, velvety hollandaise chipotle sauce. In an eggs benny, it's always the gross amount of sauce that kills it for me. Vieux Velo's hollandaise wasn't smothering the eggs and it actually had a pleasant taste. Way to go, VV, your hollandaise didn't make me want to barf.   Solid breakfast."}
{"text":"Le vieux Vélo est à côté de chez moi donc c'est un peu la facilité de venir ici. Je dois avouer que c'est souvent bien rempli et vous pouvez patienter au café Odessa à coté et ils viennent vous chercher quand une table est dispo.  J'ai bien aimé les mon plat ainsi que le café filtre mais je ne suis pas un grand fan du lieu au final. Je trouve qu'il y a d'autres endroits bien plus accueillants et on vous presse un peu pour manger car d'autres personnes attendent dehors"}
{"text":"Went with a couple friends to have a brunch. We arrived and had to wait, but it really didn't take longer than 15min. So quick! Food is delicious, everyone was satisfied!!! Drinks took a bit longer to come but it was a sunday morning, so it's kinda crowded! But we didn't even notice, because the staff was soo friendly!!! Loved it! Would sure recommend it!! And I rated it 4 stars only because I wish the tables were a bit bigger, considering plates are very well served, but I understand it's part of the \"homely minimalist\" atmosphere they have there! OH, that BAB!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! In Montreal for a few days with not much info about the places around the area. The place we found in the internet for brunch was full so one of the waitresses recommandés this one. Great breakfast, good coffee, nice and fast service. Really kids friendly, with the kids menu on a colouring page that my daughter got to keep. Tasty food and generous portions."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp while visiting Montreal.   Liked what I saw as menu options.   Three of use went and ordered different items and thoroughly enjoyed our brunch, my favorite was the eggs benedict (forgot the actual name on the menu though).    Was very pleased with the service and atmosphere of the restaurant as well.  In addition to this it is in a nice neighborhood with many shops so had a good time walking around after brunch.   Easy to get to if traveling without a car by metro and bus."}
{"text":"Awesome cozy spot where Brunch is a art form! The choices are short however it took some thinking since I could have had all the items on the menu! I eventually decided on a Poulet sandwich with an flavorful curry/pesto  sauce that was delightful while my wife ordered one of the many great choices of the Benedict eggs with rich tasting ham! Highly recommended this place which is within distance to downtown Montreal!"}
{"text":"THE BEST PRICED BRUNCH IN MONTREAL! This review is LONG over-due! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Le Vieux Vélo! This is my family's go-to brunch place! Although you will find me here more often on a week-day, the wait is not too bad if you decide to come on the week-end. And, if by chance the wait happens to be a bit long, then head over to Café Odessa directly next door for a delicious cup of third-way coffee and the host/hostess at Le Vieux Vélo will come over and let you know when your table is ready. The wait staff is attentive and courteous and our five year-old has always been treated sweetly. The best part of Le Vieux Vélo are the prices. I promise you, there is no better priced brunch in all of Montreal. For $9 or $10 you will eat a heavenly and filling breakfast platter. Whereas, other brunch places in the neighborhood are charging 25-50% more for something not nearly as good."}
{"text":"Oui!!! On aime! On ne réinvente pas la roue mais tout y est honnête et bon.  Endroit décontracté et digne du quartier.   Clientèle locale sans prétention."}
{"text":"Super adresse bonne et bon marché. La déco est sympa, le brunch bon et simple - mention particulière pour les oeufs bénédicte au brie. Petite déception sur le chai latte qui manquait de crémeux."}
{"text":"This place fucking rocks. Friendly service, good coffee, and everything I've has to eat has been great (yeah, OK, sometimes the potatoes are kinda tough). Great Benedictines, French toast, fruit, it's all wicked.  Additionally, their bathrooms are very clean. I'm often hungover as fuck when I'm here (but not today!) and one day it was a close thing that I even made it in (good thing it was unoccupied). I had a close view of the can for a few minutes and it was spotless."}
{"text":"\"The old bike\" has a pretty immense reputation. A friend and I went to check it out on a Wednesday morning, and were delighted to find no queue! The service was prompt, maybe even too prompt, so this might not be the place to chill and chat. I'm a bit surprised that everyone loved the service: the waitress was..just there. Not particularly enthusiastic about..anything at all really.   My friend ordered the Standard, without meat, she loved it! The plates are actually big, which was a lovely surprise - they look fairly small in pictures! I got the french toast, which was also huge, and sprinkled with cinnamon, some fruits and granola. It comes with a side of plain yogurt and a little tin of actual maple syrup. I would have enjoyed more if it had been warm and freshly made. For a $14 plate of bread, I was disappointed.  My friend loved (loved! loved!) her coffee. Neither of us expected it since she got a simple filtered coffee and not a fancy latte/expresso..She loved it so much that she asked our aloof waitress to give her the specifics. She pointed us to café Odessa next door. Bad surprise next door: the barista let out an annoyed groan: \"I don't understand why they keep on directing people here, we don't carry that coffee they use!\". Well that sucks."}
{"text":"Great eggs Benedict at this tiny neighborhood spot. Perfect potatoes. I love the French tradition of a small salade with breakfast.   Expect a short wait before 10 am on weekends. Grab an espresso at Odessa, their even smaller coffee shop next door.  It's a 15 minute UBER from Old City, but worth it if you want to escape the tourist traffic on the weekend."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict is the most difficult breakfast dish to pull off in my experience.  It requires a delicate balance of flavors to be truly good, in addition to the skill needed to make good hollandaise sauce.  During my stay in Montreal, I went to a couple places for eggs benny. Le Vieux Vélo had the best that I tried, by far.    I had the BAB (bacon, avocado, and brie), which aside from sounding the most appetizing also comes highly recommended.  I was not disappointed!  Everything from the side salad to the potatoes was delicious and perfectly executed.  The hollandaise especially was light and perfectly portioned.  Would definitely recommend, and I definitely plan on returning for more one day."}
{"text":"Le Bab- bacon, avocado, brie. This is heaven on a plate. Street parking available along with a wait time. Go early if you can."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Eggs Benedict I've had in Montreal.   Skeptically ordered the BAB. At first I was like: \"Lemon in the bechamel?\" But after my first bite, it was all: \"Lemon in the bechamel!\" Seriously, you'd think it wouldn't make a huge difference, but oh my god, Yelp Reader... oh my god.   And did I mention that it's really well priced? Most expensive Benedict was maybe $9.50, which is a steal in Montreal.   Anywho, it's amazing. You should probably go there."}
{"text":"We visited here for breakfast because of the great reviews on Yelp and we weren't disappointed.  My son and I had the eggs benedict with bacon and asked for the English muffins to be replaced with potatoes. The hollandaise sauce was wonderful and the potatoes were so crisp and delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly and were lovely and runny when we cut into them.  The side salad was delicious, with a ginger vinaigrette.   My husband had the B.A.B., which is eggs benedict with brie, avocado and bacon. He really enjoyed it, but said it was a little salty.   The service was very efficient and the restaurant was clean. The prices were very reasonable.  All in all, it was very good and we'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Un brunch dans une ambiance relax: check! Le menu est limité mais les plats sont assez bon. Le prix est raisonnable pour ce qui a dans notre assiette. ufs bénédictine et croque-monsieur à l'honneur."}
{"text":"When we first came to the place, it look pretty small but turns out there was two rooms! the place was packed so we had to wait in line for about 5 minutes, it got busy later on during the day (we came there around 7-8 in the morning) Staff were really friendly! I ordered their lemonade and their eggs benedict and both were amazing and filling! Their prices are decent, not too expensive around 5-15$! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Après en avoir été entendu parler sur les différents blogs et vu quelques photos, je suis donc allé déjeuner au Vieux Vélo. Petit resto sympa à l'entrée de la Petite Italie,  bon service, déco simpliste avec cadres aux murs, pour ce qui est de la nourriture, les oeufs bénédictines avec bacon + patates étaient délicieux & croustillants. Mon café latté était bon. Pas de prétentions pour ce petit resto à déjeuner et prix abordables, on aime ça !"}
{"text":"Incredible eggs benedict (get the B.A.B).  Go early - gets super busy after 9am.  Yep, just like everyone said... incredible eggs benedict.  Probably the best I've ever had. The Brie Avocado Bacon was incredible - perfectly poached eggs atop crispy english muffins and smothered with a rich, buttery hollandaise.  My gf had the one with pesto hollandaise, which was nearly as good. The place was packed on a sunday morning, as to be expected... and the service was as to be expected in a busy brunch place."}
{"text":"First brunch on our trip to Montréal, and it hit the spot!  We were on our way to Jean-Talon and thought we'd give Yelp a try, despite its limited presence outside of the US. \"Le Vieux Vélo\" popped right up and had too many starts (and too cute a name) to pass up.  Really friendly service, cozy set up and good food. We had as normal a brunch as one can get: coffee, eggs, fruit, toast & salad.  All were good, inexpensive and served with a smile. Not sure I'd go so far as to say \"I'll be back if I'm in Montréal again\" but I'd be back if I were in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why they call this place Le vieux vélo - my husband hypothesized that that it used to be a bike repair shop - but the name truly suits it. I liked it the moment I stepped in. It's casual and unpretentious, with interesting artwork for sale by local artists hung on the walls. The food's good too. The classic bacon and eggs were served in a generous portion, while the benedicts (i had the one with brie and avocado) were tasty and satisfying. My husband LOVED the benedicts with saumon, I swear he finished it in less than 5 minutes. Probably one of the best value for money brunch places in Montreal."}
{"text":"Mon envie de brunch hebdomadaire m'a poussée à faire des recherches et les avis sur Le Vieux Vélo semblaient très positifs, je devais voir ça de mes propres yeux (et de mes propres papilles!)...   Du coup après 2 essais, je ne comprends toujours pas l'engouement pour cet endroit ; oui c'est pas mal, mais ni le lieu ni les plats n'en font un modèle d'originalité. Il n'y a rien de surprenant et lorsqu'on voit le monde patienter pour venir ici on en est que plus étonné !  Ce que j'ai aimé : - Les oeufs bénédictines ; plusieurs choix, le mien s'est porté sur le B.A.B (Bacon, avocat et Brie, miam !) et je me suis régalée !  - Latté et smoothies délicieux  Ce que j'ai moins aimé : - L'attente... interminable. J'ai de la difficulté à attendre pour pouvoir manger, et encore plus pour les brunchs à Montréal !! - J'ai demandé des fèves en extra... et j'ai eu une demi poignée. Plus sérieusement on m'a apporté une portion ridiculement petite. Pour 1 $ je ne m'attendais pas à un bol mais quand même... - Nous avons senti la friture toute la journée (trop proches de la cuisine ?) - Le rapport quantité / prix. À côté de mes ufs se trouvait une ridicule tomate coupée en lamelle et une poignée de patates rôties (juste de quoi me mettre en appétit)"}
{"text":"Au vieux vélo, on y va pour une chose: les oeufs Bénédicte! La carte comprend quelques autres choix, mais on ne regarde même pas. Pour ma part, j'ai pris ceux aux épinards, et bien quelle surprise de voir dans mon assiettes des épinards frais sautés, encore croustillants! Les oeufs étaient parfaitement réalisés, accompagnés de pommes de terres sautées fondants et bien assaisonnées. L'hiver vous pouvez accompagner votre assiette d'un chai latte maison. Petit regret: les assiettes ne sont pas très copieuses, et on a donc envie de finir sur une touche sucrée, qui est malheureusement inexistante à la carte... Ça permet aussi de rester raisonnable! Le service est très agréable."}
{"text":"The place has a hipster feeling to it... We had the BAB with a side of sausage... the food was very good. However, the latte was AMAZING... I was surprised... did not expect it to be one of the best in the city. Staff is nice. Quality is good... good job! (will be back for those amazing potatoes too)"}
{"text":"Dans un décor digne d'une ancienne salle de classe, je fond littéralement pour leurs ufs  bénédictines et surtout pour leur délicieuse sauce hollandaise.  Accompagné d'un  smoothie maison du jour, rien de mieux pour vous remettre sur vos deux pieds !  Ils m'ont inspiré ma philosophie du brunchislife !"}
{"text":"Delicious! Good food, good service, good coffee. An excellent stop in Mile End."}
{"text":"Une place bien belle. Pour le temps d'attente, il nous est proposé d'aller au chaud dans le café d'à coté puis le serveur vient nous chercher. Cependant, le service n'était pas de très haute qualité. De plus, les assiettes des plats principaux n'étaient pas très pleines. Un petit dessert était bien nécessaire."}
{"text":"Très tôt dimanche matin, on a profité pour se rendre de Verdun jusqu'au Vieux Vélo vu que la veille on avait laissé notre voiture dans le coin après quelques verres de trop. J'ai suivi la recommandation de Marie-Eve M et j'ai opté pour les oeufs bénédictines sans même jeter un coup d'oeil au reste. Je dois avouer qu'avec l'option en plein milieu de la page du menu, et des choix irrésistibles comme le BAB (brie, avocat, bacon) et l'Atlantique (fromage à la crème, saumon fumé, câpres et oignions rouges), la spécialité de la place est facile à repérer. Nos bols de café au lait (double!) étaient chauds, crémeux et corsés sans être amers. J'aime bien que leur \"bols\" qui sont en fait des grosses tasses avec une belle anse qui permet de ne pas se brûler le bout des doigts. J'ai aussi remarqué qu'au fond il y avait quelques jeux de sociétés qui avaient l'air amusants. Vers 10h environ, alors que nous quittions, ça commençait à se remplir de jeunes familles, de couples et de groupes d'amis, donc allez-y tôt, ou bien attendez vous à attendre un peu. Ça en vaut la peine."}
{"text":"Super rapport qualité/prix pour un brunch. Les ufs bénédictines sont parfait, mon préféré le B.A.B (bacon avocat brie), ensuite le saumon :). Les smoothies/jus sont classique mais accompagne très bien les plats. Et pour finir sur une note sucrée, un pain dorée avec des fruits et du sirop d'érable :). Conseil ne pas venir à plus 4, sinon l'attente sera longue."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch pour un prix très raisonnable! Je recommande fortement les ufs bénédictines avec avocat, bacon et brie :))) certainement les meilleurs ufs bénédictines à Montréal!"}
{"text":"Best eggs benny, friendly staff, yummy coffee & always worth the wait. This is my go to brunch spot and it never disappoints. My Griffintown/NDG people even agree that it's worth the trek! Also, their breakfast cocktails: super yummy!!! Don't be scared if it seems like a long wait, they're super efficient and the food is so good that people seem to wolf their food down fairly fast and then free up space for the hungry masses outside. There's bike parking outside & they take credit cards."}
{"text":"If you like eggs benedict, this place is like Mecca. Went here on a Saturday morning and it does get pretty packed. We got there relatively early and we still were only able to get seating at the counter. And by the time we left there was a sizable crowd waiting outside in the cold.   I had the B.A.B because I'm a sucker for bacon and brie. Finding the two of them together on a Saturday morning is like having God smile and wink at you from the heavens. But they have more eggs benedict options than I've ever seen on a menu together and some of the other ones were almost as tempting.   While we waited for our food, we had lattes. And I don't know what kind of magical beans these guys use, but this was the best latte I've ever had. Got a cup and regretted not getting a larger size, even though they would have had to roll me out of there.   Now onto the main event, the eggs benedict. They came with deliciously seasoned potatoes and tomato. For all my anticipation and high expectations, these eggs were seriously so much better than I could have dreamed. I cannot even. I seriously considered going out of our way the next morning to go back and eat there again but sadly we didn't. If I don't get to go back to Montreal in this lifetime, I will die regretting that."}
{"text":"This place looks 'basic' when you walk in but its pretty good! Found parking just in front. Coffee is ok. Looks like they got a real coffee maker to make espresso. We took cappuccino which was good but not amazing. Note that the coffee place next door serves amazing coffee. Smoothie was good but a bit expensive for the price. We were pleasantly surprised with the food! I tried the BLT sandwich with avocado and brie. Much better than it looks on the picture. Eggs beny with avocado were also apparently delish. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Le vieux vélo est un petit resto/salon de thé dont les spécialités sont les ufs bénédictes. J'ai choisi le BAB: brie-avocat-bacon et je n'ai pas été déçue! La cuisson des ufs pochés est maîtrisée, les ingrédients sont originaux, le tout servi rapidement et avec le sourire! Le lieux est charmant décoré avec du vieux mobilier retapé. Attention ils ne servent pas de dessert..."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious.  The portions are just right.  They have many eggs benny options, and all came with roasted potatoes and fresh tomato.  The coffee was good and the service was great.  Everyone was really friendly to us and gave us great advice on what to do on a weekend in Montreal.  If you're in this neighborhood, definitely go here!"}
{"text":"Worst egg benedict I've eaten.   1-star for the atmosphere and because it's next to Odessa (at least you can drink a decent cup of coffee after)  I order L'atlantique. Quarter of the salmon was brown, so it's been sitting out for some time. The worst part: benedict sauce. It was very diluted and not tasty at all. Why would I pay 10 bucks for something that I doesn't even taste closely good a proper benedict.   Also they serve (regular, not sweet) potatoes which taste weirdly sweet.   Not going back again. If you're around Beaubien and want a decent breakfast, take 10 mins and walk up north and go to le Pick-Up. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Gosh the bennies are deliche here. My first visit I enjoyed the smoked salmon plate. More recently I got the famed BAB (bacon, avocado, brie) and I can safely say both plates were perfect, especially for the price point. Given the location of Vieux Velo, the great service, and the fantastic product they could totally jack their prices, but they don't. The affordability of the cutesy hole-in-the-wall definitely contributes to long wait times on weekends for a table but trust me, it's worth it.  The only hiccup in our recent experience was the vegan plate. I definitely appreciate that they have a tofu scramble, however my partner found it to be pretty dry and on the seriously basic range of scrambles available in Montreal. Apparently the vegan sausages were pretty good though (I think they're gusta brand).  I'll definitely be back but probs with just omnivore buddies."}
{"text":"Very cheap brunch in a simple environment, and but the food is good and impeccable service."}
{"text":"My husband and I snuck into LVV in the nick of time, being the last people in for that given Saturday. This was our one chance at the famed \"Montreal brunch,\" and we chose well!  LVV is a small, simple, and retro joint (in the most affectionate way possible). There were lots of couples and small groups meeting for brunch.  We were allowed in after agreeing to order very quickly. They handed us a menu in French; thankfully, our elementary-level French was good enough to understand what we'd want. (I'm sure there are other awesome options we missed, but that's ok!)  My husband got the legendary B.A.B., a Benedict with brie, bacon, and avocado. It was definitely a winner, a combination where, with every bite, you realize, life just got better with this dish. (I certainly appreciate the difficulty of making poached eggs, but my husband's was slightly overdone.) I got the Florentine - also very good and topped with an awesome chipotle hollandaise.  Very solid experience and thankful they let us in!"}
