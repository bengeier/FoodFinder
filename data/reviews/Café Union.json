{"text":"I was already familiar with Cafe Union's beans, getting beans delivered to me via Lufa, but I never realized they had a brick and mortar shop until my partner started doing research into upgrading our coffee making setup. If you like coffee, and make it at home (or work), this is the place for you!

The shop itself is quite small but packed to the brim with all kinds of goodies. Fancy espresso machines, pour over sets, filters, coffee cups and so much more! If it has to do with some sort of coffee, they've probably got it! The staff are knowledgeable and patient, and don't try to upsell you. At peak times there is a wait to speak with someone, but it's totally worthwhile as they then devote their full attention to you. To those with mobility issues (or with stroller in tow, as was our case), there are a few steps to get in, which may or may not be a problem for some people (weren't for us, but would definitely be for someone in a wheelchair). 

There is also a small coffee bar and a wall of beans, so you can pick up whatever amount of beans you need. No space to really consume the coffee except standing at the bar, it seemed most people took theirs to go. Judging by the steady stream of customers, they seem to have quite the following.

Overall, a great place, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Jupiter Espresso Bar blend here is quite nice, especially at $10 a pound. Coffee served can be excellent, but a bit hit or miss. I like to stop by here and oogle the machines. Nice selection of cleaning agents, accessories, etc. They service machines, too.

Rating Scale:
1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"I live right next to this spot and every morning I wake up to the smell of roasting beans. Pretty delightful. Some say it's smells a bit like burnt toast, i'd say it smells like awesomeness mixed with peppers. 

They are in fact one of the oldest operating coffee roasters in Montreal, with more than 100 years in the making of the perfect bean. They have a pretty wide variety of essences and you can, as always, do your own mixes. If you are a restaurateur, they have everything you need, from machines to delivery.

Price is good, and they sell all that fancy stuff, like the Trudeau collection and some really neat European collections related to the 'art' of making coffee. They also have a service and a repair section.

So next time your are wondering about where to find good coffee beans in Montreal, and an all lot more, Cafe Union is the place to go. Parking is easy too. If you are ending up buying one of those fancy espresso machine :)"}
{"text":"Union is a great shop for coffee and espresso supplies. Their staff isn't always attentive so it helps if you know what you need prior to arriving. I regularly buy Cafiza/Rinza/Dezcal at Union and they also have accessories like tampers, pitchers, etc. I also bought a set of burrs here in an emergency and they were quite accommodating. They have a nice selection of machines as well as glassware including Acme cups. I haven't tried their beans but from what I gather, they are fairly similar to what you'd get from Caffe Italia."}
