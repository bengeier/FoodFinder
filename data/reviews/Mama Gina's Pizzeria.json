{"text":"Average, average, average. Great location near the arena, but food and service were just OK. Our antipasto salad seemed to be made with cold cuts rather fresh meat. The kids spaghetti is something you can make at home. Our Stromboli was good, enough for 2, but not overly impressive. The garlic bread knots were really good though. Thumbs up to the bread and fries appetizers as they looked really good. Pizza just looked OK."}
{"text":"We have been here three times now, experience was different each time.  First two times after Cardinal's game was great.  Food came out quickly and service was attentive.  Went in the other day and they made our pizza wrong two times and also had to get up to ask for service, even though place was empty except one other group.  Only rating three stars because of two positive experience, otherwise would have been 1 star."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, and everything we ordered was fabulous! I can't think of the last time that we went to a restaurant where everyone in our family (7of us) agreed that the food was great. Our service was great as well- our server Megan was very nice and attentive. I can wholeheartedly recommend everything we ordered: the bruschetta, garlic cheese bread, wings (BBQ and spicy), extra cheese-cheese pizza,Chicken Picatta, and even my little ones chicken tenders and fries were above average. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Only giving it 2 stars because the pizza was good. A special was written on the outside board, but when I asked about it they said it was no longer available. Ordered garlic knots and pizza and only pizza was brought out. No plates and no garlic knots. When the pizza was brought out, we were asked if we wanted garlic bread instead, without any explanation. Decided not to get garlic bread. Hubby went next door to get doughnuts to take home with us, while we were waiting for our food. They wouldn't allow us to bring a dozen doughnuts in. The bathrooms were a mess with no soap and the service wasn't good. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Food was disgusting the only reason we went there was that we bought a restaurant s.com voucher where you save like 20.00 dollar s so we decided to try it and we ordered a salad , dozen wings , large pepperoni pizza . The lettuce was old the tomatoes where mushy , the wings tasted like they've been sitting for a while , and finally the pizza was flavor less nothing on the pizza stuck out . But that is not the worst part nasty food aside THE STAFF DECIDED TO ADD THEMSELVES A 30% TIP never going there again"}
{"text":"Great customer service.  Matt, our server, was tops! However, the meat lovers pizza was below par.  It tasted very salty.  Overpriced!  Wouldn't recommend this pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza was soggy and didn't taste that great. The restaurant was also dirty and the servers were not attentive."}
{"text":"Really great pizza! This is the first place I stop if I plan on doing some shopping at Tanger. Normally, I go during the week so my waitresses are always attentive. I find it hilarious people are whining about having to wait during something like a cardinals game. Haha! What did you expect? Everyone was going to go eat somewhere else? Get over yourselves. I have ordered a few different things from their menus, love the wings, bar, and pizza. Also tried the Calzone and that is AMAZING. Yet to try the pasta but I suspect it is just as good. Always my \"Go-to\" place :) My only gripe is the tables wobble. Like, a lot haha. I know its nothing too crazy, but as a personal nudge you should get something a little more sturdy. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Italian food you can tell it's made from scratch....our server Dylan was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"A trip to Cabela's is not for the faint-hearted. After traipsing through the indoor wilderness, my family and I were hungry, and planned to go to Tanger Outlets after grabbing some lunch. Since Westgate was right across the street, we figured we could easily get some food. To top it off, we were craving pizza. Low and behold, Mama Gina's was ready to answer the call when we arrived. We went on a Wednesday morning, shortly after they opened, and easily got seating. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, but considerate too, letting us take off our jackets and get settled in before asking for drink and food orders. Their iced tea was tasty, fresh and cool.   We got some garlic knots for an appetizer, and were all shocked at how large they were. Topped with garlic, melted Parmesan, and butter, my mouth watered at the mere sight of them (and is watering now at the memory, goodness). They were just as delectable when we dug in. The marinara sauce was an amazing plus, delicious and flavorful. To be honest, I'm not usually a fan of marinara by itself, but with this appetizer, I couldn't get enough; we'd eaten almost all of it by the time our pizza arrived. We ordered a 16\", half bacon, half ham. I'm used to fakin' bacon on pizza, but no worries here! This bacon was the real McCoy, smoked and delicious on top of all the melted cheese. According to my folks, the ham was pretty good, too. We ended up leaving one slice of ham pizza uneaten, because we were stuffed. It wasn't too bad on the wallet, either. We left happy and full, and will definitely come back in the near future to satisfy our appetite for pizza.  After coming here to give my review, I am baffled this place doesn't have a higher rating. As far as I'm concerned, this place is great. The food is delectable, the service was spot on, and I'm very happy that such a quality pizzeria is relatively closeby. Five stars for you, Mama Gina's. Never change."}
{"text":"Well although the the food was very good seating wasnt.   We ordered pizza and an app but it was quite expensive even for being at Westgate. We were sat by an opening that servers kept leaving open... it was an issue because it was very cold that night.   I would go back just for the food but will have to scout for the right seats."}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple. We were sat at 5pm and told the server we were ordering by the slice because we were in a hurry. He forgot to put in our order until 5:20, and slices came out at 5:35. The quality was on par with Sbarro. I could understand if the place was packed, but there were 6 employees along with the owner working, and only 4 tables sat the entire time we were there. The only reason this isn't 1 star is that the decor & bar area was pretty awesome.  I also wasn't a huge fan of both TVs being tuned to BlackHawk Down- not really something I want my toddlers watching."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I hope they go out of business and a new place comes in that knows what customer service is. Arrived and the patio was empty but it was cold. We put our name on the list to sit inside and were the only name at the time. Was told it would be 15 minutes. They continued to seat tables of 2 and fill the patio. I gave up a prime spot outside next to a heater that would have been fine thinking we would be seated soon. 1 hour later we were not seated and all the patio was filled and inside there were atleast 8 new tables of 2 and 4. We were wanting a table of 5. The manager did nothing to get us seated after we spoke up and the hostess was a real b!$&@! I will never step foot in that place. Update: owner replied with a totally made up version of the story. She replied in a very condescending manner which further solidified my original assessment of their customer service. Still won't admit when they were wrong. I did say I hoped they went out of business, that was wrong. I should have said their management team needed a full lobotomy. Nice try trying to paint me into the bad guy."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and its always yummy!  Celebrated my daughters 15th birthday with her friends.  The service and food was awesome!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible. The pizza was bland and sparse toppings. Garlic cheese bread had zero garlic and bread was soggy."}
{"text":"Great place!!  Bartender Steven went above and beyond.  Give them a try!  Desserts looked amazing.....we will have to come back for that."}
{"text":"Service was horrible,food over priced, bathrooms were a mess. Over all experience was bad. Wouldn't recommend at all."}
{"text":"Service was good but food was overpriced and undercooked.  It's obvious that they use precooked pizzas and reheat them with the toppings you order.  The toppings were raw and the bottom of the pizza burnt.  Be careful if trying to use an online gift certificate because they are not valid during \"events\".  We found out a hockey game was in progress and they refused to honor the gift certificate.  This place is already out of business, they just don't know it yet."}
{"text":"The chicken Marcela was the best we have ever had. Good portion of chicken penna noodle. The chef was excellent n the price was right"}
{"text":"Before eating there for the first time, I called to ask if their patio was dog-friendly. They told me that it was, so we brought our very well-behaved, certified therapy dog for lunch with us. The servers were nice & brought water for our dog. One of them, as well as other patrons, even took her picture. We went there three more times with our dog & were welcomed. Here's where it goes bad: We went for lunch on a Saturday. That's apparently one of the days that the owner is there, & he absolutely refused to allow our dog on the patio. He told us that there is a state law forbidding non-service dogs from patio dining. We knew this wasn't the truth. He told us if we could prove that, he'd allow dogs there. I found the county laws regarding patio dining & dogs & faxed it to him. Basically all they needed to do was post a sign stating that their patio is dog friendly. He sent us an email, going back on his word & still refusing. We will not spend another dime at a restaurant whose owner has zero integrity."}
{"text":"Worst management team ever. I was just there last week and I fell in love with the food the waiter was very polite and made sure my food was out right away because I had to go back to work. Went back today with my boyfriend because I loved it the first time and it was like a completely different place. The waiter was extremely rude and I waited so long for my food to come that I had to take it to go. As I sat down in my office at work I noticed that my order was incomplete. I was missing the knot and my plate was more water than it was sauce. How is that even possible? So I called back to have Luis answer, I told him my situation and he offered me a piece of bread for my next visit... Really? Even McDonald's offered you a whole meal no questions asked. So I decided to not touch my food and return once I left work. I went back after work and I gave Luis the food back and he didn't even look at it he tossed off to the side and left. He walked in and out of the kitchen walked around the restaurant even started attending other customers as I waited on him to at least remake my food. The older lady who was the waiter kept giving me dirty looks. If looks could kill I would probably be dead. When he finally ran out of excuses to avoid me he gave me a 10% discount card. I'm beyond pissed off. That not only did I pay for it, I also returned it and he couldn't even  give me a new plate or my money back. I was pretty much robbed tonight. I asked if I could speak to his manager and very rudely told me to call tomorrow. As I drove home I remembered he didn't give me a receipt or a letter to prove that I had returned my food. So I called him back and he said to me \"why are you asking for so much when I had supposedly eaten over half the food.\" He even decided to cross the line and literally called me a liar. I asked Luis why he was calling me that when I had returned my food and he said \"well you called me a liar first!\" This is the people you have running your restaurant? I'm more than disappointed, I paid for food that I never ate and was poorly treated."}
{"text":"SO Annoyed!   So come to find out that this place has TWO different Menus. ONE is the normal day to day w  ith decent prices. TWO is a menu that they bust out on GAME DAYS!  Its limited and I understand they want to turn tables and have easy quick meals.   BUT to  RAISE your $$$$ PRICES because of the increased business after the game is RIDICULOUS!!!!!  POOR BUSINESS ETHICS, POOR MANAGEMENT! Not only will I not be back on game day but I won't be back any other day. ALSO,  their website states $10 16-inch pies on Wednesdays and Sundays but when we were there on Sunday after the game they charged 17.50 and they said they no longer have the special even though it's indicated on the website!"}
{"text":"Wanted a relaxing night in an outdoor environment. Had a delicious margarita pizza with great sangria. Would highly recommend a visit and a dine-in experience!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS A REAL JOKE..... Stopped in for the day special on the way to a movie. We got served an under cooked doughy pie, that we sent back to have finished in the oven. It never returned to our table. Our server showed 15 minutes later to tell us that our pie had been burned. We asked to see a manager. He came over with our \"discounted\" check. We told him we weren't paying for the pie. He says you're paying for 4 pieces. We laughed and told him no we weren't. After a short argument we walked out. Bad service, bad attitudes of the mgmt. make for no return trip. My advise is to stay away from Mama Ginas."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Our waitress, Heather, was super nice and attentive to our needs. Pizza is good, slightly greasy though. Wings melt in your mouth. Garlic bread also melts in your mouth. do recommend. Cool atmosphere, just wish there was a better waiting area but they seated us pretty quickly."}
{"text":"I can't give any stars because we couldn't get in. Went to a movie Friday night then after seeing the ad for Mama Gina's in the theatre, we went to give a try. It was around 10 o'clock, and they were closed. Posted hours said midnight. And that's not to mention all the roaches around the area at Westgate. Don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"This must be a new place as we just discover it after seeing a move across the street. Absolutely an amazing pizza and wings. I ordered a six pc of wings mild, very good, my wife had small salad, very fresh and delicious. We ordered the white pizza, was wonderful, first time trying this kind of pizza. We also brought a Calzone and spaghetti home for the kids and they love it.   Price wise very reasonable, clean and FAST service. The owner came to our table couple of times and i would give them an A++ to take interest in their business. We always support family owned business anywhere we go.   To finish our dinner we shared strawberry cheese cake, was a bit small, however very good. overall very good place to eat extremely well prices for what you get."}
{"text":"We couldn't decide where to eat at Westgate and walked by Mama Gina's Pizzeria and the food smelled fabulous so we decided to give it a try.  We started with the bruschetta and a small Greek salad, both were delicious. We shared the chicken marsala with penne and was not disappointed.  Terrific food,  atmosphere and service from Justine.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I hate to give this one star, but zero is not an option. I'll keep it short. We ordered garlic knots, fried zucchini, pepperoni pizza, and baked ziti. Pretty sure everything was taken out of a freezer and then not cooked at the proper temperature or time. I've had better food that was sitting under a gas station heat lamp for two days. On the plus side, they didn't charge us extra for the food floating in the beer!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here once before and the food was very good. This time as we were walking in the door we were stopped by the hostess and told that there was a $20.00 minimum per person. There was no explanation why. Will probably not go back."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Our waitress was Brittini she was so awesome. We were in a rush because, our movie started soon. She got us in & out. The cook gave my 4 year old a garlic knot & he loved it. Thanks guys for the ol school customer service!"}
{"text":"I just wanna say that Mama Ginas is by far one of the best restaurants I have ever been to! They went above and beyond to make sure my wife and I were satisfied. At first our pizza got messed up so they sent us out complimentary garlic knots for the inconvenience. Not only that but the chef himself came out to apologize and also gave us a free canoli. Not only do they have amazing customer service but the food is some of the best pizza I have ever had! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Horrible management, horrible service. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone! Manager was incredibly rude and did not care that we had complaints about service and told us to leave if we didn't like it. He was arrogant and belligerent and I will never try and go there nor recommend this place to anyone I know or don't know."}
{"text":"Headed over Saturday evening... we were seated immediately on the patio (our preference) our server came quickly and got our drink orders in. Ordered our food...a veggie pizza with added meatballs... and an eggplant parm.  All the food was cooked perfect and was really yummy!  I wish I could remember our servers name...she was great!  Great easy atmosphere and good food!"}
{"text":"The new Sriracha Sausage pizza is amazing! Also have to have the new fries! Everything is always perfect!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch one afternoon during a break from a work activity in a nearby hotel.  This area is teeming with good restaurants.  Unfortunately, this is not one of them.  The side salad was terrible (large chunks of stale lettuce, very large uncomfortable chunks of tomato, and a few olives).  The pizza was mediocre (slice of NY style pizza with melted cheese, tough crust, and burned veggies).  The service was pleasant, but slow.  Maybe I caught them on an off afternoon, because I am surprised that a place like this can survive with all of the high quality restaurants in this immediate area."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and BLOWN AWAY by the food and the service. Wings: Delicious. Salads: Fresh and yummy. The best part: The pizza. I travel a lot for work and eat a lot of pizza from around the country. This is among the best! Fresh, crisp dough with a fluffy crust. The sauce is the freshest I've enjoyed. It tasted so fresh--like they made it from fresh tomatoes just for my pizza. And Crystal, our server, was great! Mama Gina's is not your typical grease-fest, heavy pizza. It's fresh, homemade and delicious."}
{"text":"Consistently disappointing.  I love supporting small business and  have been going to this place since it opened.  I am continually overlooking their faults because I LOVE their eggplant sandwich but I now realize it is a place I will not be going to anymore.  Usually my issues are with the service, which is not a surprise since I never consistently see the same faces there.    I have had a problem with the server overtipping themselves on my credit card.  I luckily noticed on a statement.   I did have this issue resolved but it took many calls for this to happen.  If you stay and eat there, the place is often very messy.  I have seen servers walk past a broom that had fallen in the middle of the floor instead of picking it up and putting it away.  I have seen servers pull tables apart, while people were sitting at them on game nights, even though the whole place was empty and the tables were not needed at that point.   My last (and it will be final) experience made me the most disappoint. I had made a to- go order.  I was surprised at how expensive it was this particular time.    I soon learned they are different menus for \"game nights\" (hockey games, etc) and apparently you are charged more even on to-go orders, which I find ridiculous.   My sandwich that I usually get costs almost $2 more and on this particular time the bread was burnt.  It is not that great of a place to go to, to spend that much money and I was frustrated that they price gauge, even on to go order to make a couple extra dollars on game nights.   There are definitely better places to go at Westgate."}
{"text":"I feel horrible giving two negative reviews in a row, but my experience today at mama gina's warrants it. A friend and I came here prior to going to the football game. We ordered a pizza. After about 30 minutes had passed, I asked our server where the food was and he said that it would be right out. Another 20 minutes went by and he kept avoiding us. I asked another server for the manager. She was very nice and tried to deflect us from speaking with the owner by getting our server. After about another 10 minutes of investigating he discovered that in fact they gave our pizza to another table. He said they already started a new one and our bill would be discounted. We got our pizza, which wasn't even that good. When we got our bill, they took a measley 10% off of the bill. Any self respecting customer oriented business would have comped the pizza. Not only did we wait a ridiculous amount of time to eat a mediocre meal, but we were late for the game because of it. I will never go here again and I will never recommend it to friends or family or foe for that matter. Long story short, of I were Mama Gina, I would be highly disappointed that my name was associated with this establishment."}
{"text":"We came and Will was insanely accommodating amd went sbove and beyond to take care of us. Pizza was good, Sangria was better."}
{"text":"Outstanding ! as someone else said, service is  great, you can tell they have a regular staff and not part timers like the other venues in the area.  Food is is unique and varied and oh so good.... and man are the portions huge.  Great  job to the staff, you have something good going here. was there 7/21/13"}
{"text":"This past Saturday my girl and i went to dinner at Westgate and we stopped at Mama Ginas. First off I ordered a plate of ziti for me and it was fucking enough for 2 people. HUGE! I ordered meatballs with my meal (so I can make my girl laugh) and the serving was plenty. The salad was fresh, the bread was soft. The pasta had a spicy kick. And the host Gavin was awesome, he gave awesome service with a sense of humor.  Oh yeah, the bathroom is located in a weird area near the kitchen were I'm pretty sure both aromas   can be smelled by both kitchens cooking up a hot  one if you know what I mean  I LOVE YOU MAN!!!"}
{"text":"Went here today... We got spaghetti and their meatball sandwiches. The bread had a very stale flavor to it and the meatballs were pretty blan. The sauce was okay but nothing to brag about. Honestly would have rather had Olive Garden lol . They are way overpriced here & there was some hoodrat that they let just sit on the patio and curse the n word  and all sorts of profanity loud on his phone. It was upsetting , other diners out there didn't seem pleased with it either and staff apparently saw nothing wrong with him cursing on the top of his lungs . Take in mind we had a 4 year old child with us as well. You also get the occasional kid walking by the patio cursing or saying obscene things to women. I didn't know west gate was the hood but apparently it's close enough for them to congregate here. If I wanted to pay that much for a crappy meal in the ghetto I would have.... Wait I think I just did. Very upset ... Waste of money .... Waste of time."}
{"text":"Disappointing....I have a visitor from out of state and wanted to give them the most out of their trip so their last day my family brought them here but our beverages (bought from another restaurant) was taken away and placed to the register. Rude!!! This is the first time this ever happened to us for so many years we've been doing this in many restaurants! The weather's cold! They don't have any hot beverages so what do they expect from us to freeze? Our visitors were seniors. Old people they didn't respect and took away hot beverages from them! Disprespectful! I'll never go back here again! And definitely share this to all of my friends. The food the was bland!!!!We should have just left but since the pizza was already baked we just figured to stay to show respect. The management needs to take care of these issues. We came to eat not to have headaches. I was so upset and so is my family! Find other place to eat at westgate but not here!"}
{"text":"This pizzeria place is terrible. The service was rude and they refused to let us eat our food at the table due to \"health code rules\". We were told that we could eat outside! We were able to order drinks but were told rudely several times that we could not have our pizza until we left the premises. Very unacceptable IMHO"}
{"text":"Cardinals opening day (8.25.2015) was BUSY!   My date and I grabbed a seat at the bar and were greeted by a man in the sell-line (an individual calling the shots and assists food coming out of the kitchen by passing the food into the servers hands to be taken out to their tables. All of that done correctly by the way). This man was energetic, funny, and really owning it. Well, that's because to our surprise, it was the owner!  Sami - a HUGE personal thanks to you and your great team at Gina's. The service that you expect and show when you are present really made our first experience one to remember.   Servers were busting their asses, so there was lots of movement. That, coupled along with the loud talk of tables in the room, and they exemplary teamwork seen really makes this review an easy 5-Stars. Did I mention not one-plate crashed while we were there? Always a plus in a intimate room with many people and quick service.  Service, easy 5-Stars.   Then the food came out: A big issue with other restaurants these days have is that many places are afraid to season. ****Not Gina's.***** For me, service can be impeccable, but if the food is 'safe' then what's the point of going to eat there? Anyone can make bland-gruel. Again, you won't find that at Gina's...  We got wings (mild), and the stromboli. Holy hell, it was seasoned! Our items were cooked perfectly (impressive as it was 1 hour before the game time and a lot of other places might have rushed the food, causing under-cooking) but not here. Wings were piping hot, and not greasy, The stromboli was perfectly crispy on the outside and gooey-in the middle with a helping of herbs, and garlic+ parmesan.   Lets talk about Marinara - no, not a 50-gallon barrel of Ragu that was trucked in from god knows where, but home made, herb-infused, you can see the garlic in the blend kind of - marinara. That is the kind you will find at Gina's. My marinara is top (Duh) - but a close second is Gina's, haha.  Chefs were very professional and their cooking skills were top-notch.  If you want to feel like you've been adopted by a family in Chicago and get fed some great Italian food, then I would recommend this to you.   Salute !"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of going to Mama Gina's twice. The first time was so good I had to go again in the same week.   03/11/2015 The first time I went I had the Chicken Marsala. It was amazing. Came with my choice of pasta, side salad, and a garlic knot. The dressing for my salad was their house dressing, balsamic. AMAZING.  The service was better than good. Staff was very courteous and knowledgeable.  03/13/2015 The second time, was ever better. I had the Chicken Parmesan Dinner. And the Mama's Sampler. WOW. The sampler came with EVERYTHING. Food came out surprisingly quickly for how busy they were. We watched the game on the patio and there was live music. It was a great atmosphere. Our waitress Heather was very efficient and pleasant.  Only downside to the evening was there was only one size pizza offered the 16\".  It's a great place for a date or to take your family. ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza great ambiance.  Friendly staff.  The owner came over to ask if he could do anything else for us.  Good overall experience."}
{"text":"we came to this restaurant celebrating my birthday. customer service was absolutely terrible! we ordered 4 meals and only revived 2. then we had to physically get up and refill our own drinks and it took them 45 minutes to receive our beers. when we asked to speak to the manager he was absolutely disrespectful! i'd never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Chose restaurant based on location.  Atmosphere was good and service was great.  Food was what I anticipated, not a fine dining place more of a Pizza and Pasta, great for kids place.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"We choose this place over the many other pizza options in the area and boy that was a mistake....  I ordered a calzone to share and it was a large portion but the dough was raw and soggy! I asked if it at ricotta cheese and was told yes, and when I got it home I found out there was none. This was upsetting to me because I would have paid the extra for the ricotta had I just been told correctly.  I did order the garlic knots as well and they were okay, a little bland but not the worst I have had. All in all I will not return to this establishment not when  there is so many choices in the area."}
{"text":"Service was awesome and the garlic knots and pizza were amazing as well. Dylan was our server, super cool dude. We will definitely come back for the hospitality and full stomachs!"}
{"text":"Lunch time food great on a Saturday.....wish the service was half as good. Only 3 tables at opening and server couldn't get a drink order for 15 minutes. It's been an hour and the margarita that my wife ordered is still NOT here. Asked for ketchup and after 5 minutes had to go to the bar to get our own. Never seen such poor service here...hope this is just a fluke."}
{"text":"Love the food, they have the best wings around by far! Every time we go in the service always exceeds expectations! We have never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"This is a great local mom and pop shop that everyone needs to support. The portions are large, the food is great and the staff is amazing. Stephan the manager is helpful, fun and engaging."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times and it's one of our favorite places to have a beer and some great wings. Their pizza is good and baked ziti is wonderful. The prices are reasonable and service has always been a plus."}
{"text":"Thought we would try the place out since we never had been there.  The service was great at the drink order time, then went down hill from there.  Started out with a house salad and blue cheese dressing, they brought out ranch.  Drinks took forever to be refilled.  Food came out all but the cal zone, they said it takes a little longer,  Never came out.  They said, after flagging them down again, they forgot to turn that order in.  Really?  They offered a dessert, we just wanted the cal zone.  They offered dessert again, said no just box up the cal zone, we're going.  Paid and left."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is always accommodating and I always can expect to have a great meal! The wait staff is super friendly and I look forward to every visit! One of my favorite restaurants at Westgate!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!! The wings are really good and the pizza crust is awesome!! This would be a 5 star review if I were more into supreme pizzas, but it was still great! Our server was awesome, didn't hover not neglect us. The prices are fairly priced; you're paying for what you get. Everything's fresh here!"}
{"text":"Came here after Buffalo Wild Wings was a 45min. wait. Wanted some good food and watch the Suns game. Ate outside, nice and toasty with the heater, very friendly staff. *****Ordered a 10\" pizza for two came with 8 slices the next size up still 8 slices just bigger slices, thin crust."}
{"text":"I just had dinner last night with my girlfriend and I have to say the service and food was extremely amazing!!!!! Thanks to the owner Sam for such great hospitality ill for sure be coming back!!! And I will refer people there also!!!"}
{"text":"We found this place several years ago and had some family with us. We ordered pizza, salad and garlic knots. Everything was so delicious. We visted a few more times over the next few years and everything was so very good. Last night proved it will be the last time. A 16' pizza is now $20 or more. All the prices went up and we were told it is because of the minimum wage hike. They only have one size pizza. We ordered garlic knots they were not hot at all and sent them back. We asked for our pizza to be a little crispy and half of it ended up being burnt. We have always asked to be a little crispy and it always came out so good, not this time.  Ordered 6 wings $6.50 for 6 wings  They were very good. We asked for 1 ranch dressing to dip our pizza crust in. We got charged .60c for a souffle cup. Nope that was it. So very dissatisfied overall. Service was mediocre. Guess all customers will have to pay for the minimum wage hike, tipping no longer needed."}
{"text":"While the pizza was very good, the service and appetizers left something to be desired.  The bruschetta we ordered was quite the surprise when it showed up doused in balsamic vinegar... not a big deal to some, but we dislike balsamic and when the menu actually lists all of the ingredients for the bruschetta and balsamic vinegar was not included one would think that balsamic would not be on it.  Our waiter was clearly overwhelmed (he let us know on several occasions that it was a bad day and he had a bad table on the other side of the restaurant) and we went almost the whole meal without a refill to our drinks.  Also, tonight we ordered garlic knots for carryout and the bottoms on all six were significantly burnt and the tops were more than browned.  They were dry with out the yummy buttery garlic salt knots typically come with.  Hopefully Mama Gina's will grow into its own as it matures in its time here at the Westgate."}
{"text":"Mama Gina's is underrated and definitely not given enough respect here on yelp. We were pleasantly surprised by our meal even though we only went because of a deal we got at the movie theater. We enjoyed the appetizers, the pizza and even the dessert. The pizza isn't the best you have had, but it's good and better than we expected so we were pleased! The service was good too, so that was much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Just another overpriced pizza place taking advantage of people at Westgate when it's busy during the weekend because they do sell slices when they said they didn't. $19.99 for a 16 inch large pizza that's only cheese and doesn't even taste that great it's ridiculous. Just because it's expensive doesn't mean that it taste better. At least I can say this place is a lot cleaner, nicer, bigger than La Piazza Al Forno. Plus the staff at mama Gina's was friendlier I just don't like that they lied about only selling large pizzas. They are all about selling to you at the pricy rate."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but service was really bad. We waited and waited for drink refills and we felt as if we were being rushed out so that they could seat more people as fast as possible.   Not sure if we will ever come back here."}
{"text":"Like I told the waitress's as I left it was total crap pizza! They had nerve to charge me for thAt poor excuse for a pizza! I couldn't even eat it, it was a mess of cheese. I hate places that specialize in something like Pizza or call themselves a pizzeria when you can get the same crap at Circle K! Nough said!!"}
{"text":"Really?  60¢ for a side of ranch?  Well that's a first.   I don't use ketchup, so I sually ask for something else to dip my fries.  We had ordered the fried zucchini and it came with ranch, so I was using that on my fries too.  When we asked for more, I had no idea they'd charge me for it.  They didn't charge us for ketchup.  And our server definitely didn't!mention there was a charge for extra.  The food and service were just ok.  I was expecting better and felt that the place was kinda divey.  We don't think we'll be dining there again especially when there are so !any better options at Westgate"}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad at all.... had pizza before the concert. Thin & crunchy, yummy. Couldn't even finish"}
{"text":"From the minute I walked in the door I felt right at home. The staff was very accommodating and our waiter was friendly. We had the sampler which was excellent and the pizza was delicious. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We came here tonight with a party of 16+ after the Dodger game. Excellent service, great vibe, delicious food. We'll be back again next year!"}
{"text":"We returned because we very much enjoyed our first experience here. Unfortunately, second time wasn't as great. I got the eggplant Parmesan in which the breading made up 95% and the eggplant made up about 5% so essentially, it was just breading and cheese. Secondly, the noodles and sauce tasted like they were dumped out from a stale can. My boyfriend got a chicken wrap and only are half as he wasn't impressed. The only thing we did enjoy was the garlic knot that came with my dish, very good! The nice atmosphere, customer service, and garlic knot make up the two stars for our experience this time around. Not sure what we ordered last time around but it was a 5."}
{"text":"used to love this place. the wings are great, made the way i enjoy. the pizza is good, but while eating my second slice i just got sick of all the cheese for some reason. My favorite was the crust so soft and yummy. still a good place to eat before going to movies."}
{"text":"My daughter brought me here for the first time and i loved it! The service is great! The margaritas are very flavorful and the prices are nice. I will definitely returning"}
{"text":"I'll start with the positives.  .... oh wait, there weren't any.  I can't even do a good analysis of the food because the wrong pizza was brought out and to boot it was a pizza we didn't particularly care for.  (Had an ingredient on it that my dining partner had a slight allergy to.) In short, completely horrible service, rude attitudes when trying to get our order straightened out, and owner/manager was unwilling to give a decent conciliation for our trouble.   Will never return.  Being treated like we were is unacceptable, especially when we acted civil and to the point.    Here is a list of follies that occured during our \"experience\" at Mama Gina's.   1.  Ordered an appetizer.  Was convinced by our waitress to try the garlic knots instead, only to find out when our food arrived 35 minutes later that they didn't even have any to bring out.  Sidenote:  After about 20 minutes we inquired on the whereabouts of this item to our waitress (20 minutes for some garlic bread is a little much) and she said she would go check...apparently that didn't happen. 2.  Wrong Pizza delivered to the table.  After inquiring about the order since it was taking quite awhile to arrive and we had a movie to catch.  The wrong pizza was brought out.  We had ordered a 16 inch BBQ Chicken pizza and a 20 inch Supreme was delivered to our table.  Honestly, it wasn't till 15 seconds after it was dropped off that we went... uh.. wait a minute... this isn't what we ordered.  Immediately went to find our waitress to let her know.  She went to her manager and they said they could make us the right one but we'd have to wait.  Pending our time issue with the movie, this wasn't an option.  Since we couldn't wait for another pizza to come out the manager said we could either take a 20% discount on the pizza or just leave and not pay.  At this point, we were starving and the movie was starting in 10 minutes.  Didn't really have a choice at this point.  I agreed to the 20% discount so we could at least have something to eat before we sat for another 2 hours without food.  (Side note:  couldn't eat much considering one of the items on the supreme includes an item that my date has a slight allergy to.) 3.  Wrong discount.  Once the bill came, we were charged for the pizza that came to our table.  Which was $9 more than what we originally ordered.  Making even the 20% discount they were offering a total more than what we were expecting to pay in the first place.  Waitress ended up paying for our beverages to help offset the cost.  Also, when speaking to the manager, he said we should have let him know sooner that there was an issue.  How were we to know???  The only thing we knew prior to the food coming out was that it was taking FOREVER to get to the table.  ... and that we did bring to their attention.    I truly dislike writing reviews that are this scathing but I just couldn't believe how we were treated by the management.  If you are in the service industry, and the mistakes are with your establishment, then do not make the customers feel as if they are the ones at fault.  I just don't believe they tried to make this better for us."}
{"text":"Stopped by this local pizza/Italian restaurant on a Tuesday before a Coyotes game. The service was excellent and the food was grand! If your meal doesn't come with a garlic knot be sure to order one, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was our second meetup at Mama Gina's. Around 10 people showing up. No problem with reservations (only 3 hours prior), and the exact seating (outside patio) was ready for us.  Just 5 hours earlier, they sent out a special over twitter: \"Today only: If you purchase 1 sandwich & a drink you can get a second sandwich free\" ( https://twitter.com/mamaginasaz/status/112260246013087744 )  All of us were planning our orders accordingly, so as to make use of the special. Instead of ordering 1 item, I was going to order more, so I could bring some home to my family. DENIED. We were told by the server, and then by management (through the server) that special was only 11a-1pm, and not available. The odd part was the original post was time-stamped around 1:30pm, after, they said, the special ended.   So what did they do to fix the situation? Absolutely nothing. In fact, one member of our party was charged extra for another side of marinera sauce for his garlic knots.  Don't get me wrong, the food and overall service was pretty good, and the food was the main reason this review was not a \"1\". However, had the special not been \"advertised\" over social media, we might have chosen a different venue. It almost seemed like a \"bait & switch\". The worst part was the complete failure to do anything to \"remedy\" the situation. Had this experience been fixed, or better yet, never occurred, this rating would have been at least a 3, and probably a 4. But for now, I can not overlook the absolute failure of communication between marketing company, restaurant management, and staff.   Here's to hoping they get everything figured out..."}
{"text":"We love coming here for casual dinner and lunch. It is also kid friendly unlike other Westgate restaurants.  I wish they had pizzas in smaller sizes bc after a salad and appetizers,  the pizza was always too big for a group of 4. But we have always had good service here."}
{"text":"We wandered in after seeing other customers delicious looking food. The hostess sat us right away. No one came to greet us or take our drink order for 20 mins so I went and asked the hostess if we had a server. She pointed to an older women next to her Lisa and said she would be there in a minute. Lisa proceeded to come over and help the table next to us that had just been sat. The hostess saw what a horrible employee this Lisa was and asked if we wanted to move to the bar. We moved to the bar and this place only regained us by Sami helping us and that the food was fabulous! Sami please fire Lisa!!! Bringing down your business. She Has a chip on her shoulder and an attitude. Almost lost us as customers."}
{"text":"We were really excited about this place.  We went in on a Saturday night after a movie.  The place was not busy.  We were seated for 25 minutes.  No one came to take our order.  The waitress was cleaning tables and walked right by us several times.  We finally had enough and got up and left.  On the way out the hostess, who sat us 25 minutes earlier told us to have a good night.  I will never go back to the place.  The service was horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.. this place was amazing!! I will definitely be going back!! The service was outstanding and the food was delicious. I was starving and they had my side salad on the table less than 5 mins from ordering.. apps in about 10 mins (wings are excellent) and then the entree which by that time I was getting full so just ate the super fresh garlic knot and side dish of spaghetti. Very satisfied!! :)"}
{"text":"We ate here before Christmas so I am a little late posting ! We had wings to start I they must have been re cooked from a pervious order because they were tuff and no meat. I had the pasta dish as an entree and it was cold, not Luke warm but cold. I think the steam well where they served from was not working properly or they forgot to microwave it before it was served! When I asked server to heat up entree it took so long my Husband had finished his meal which wasnt to hit either and I decided not to wait any longer paid check and left! Never will be back ! Server very slow and it wasn't a game night This place will only survive for the beer and no other pizza place in westgate Owners take note Your operation needs help"}
{"text":"Awesome place. I will order wings and pizza from here rather than Native. Yumm! Meat lovers pizza was the bomb.  Honey hot wings were delicious."}
{"text":"Wanted to have dinner here one night and I was greeted at the door to two (very polite) waitresses informing me that there was a $20 minimum per person. I'm sure there is an explanation for this but if there is, they didn't make it clear why. All in all it left a bad taste in my mouth which is a shame because their food is pretty good. Fix this policy and they would be a solid 4 stars"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I were trying to find a good place to eat after seeing a movie and we decided on Mama Ginas. It was the best decision we could have made. Our server, Stephanie, was amazing. She sat us to our table and not 5 minutes later, she was taking our drink orders. She Was very polite and nice. Our food came out very fast and was delicious. All 3 of the staff members were amazing and polite and made sure our food tasted good and if our service was good. We will most definitely be going there again. I highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Fabulous! The bruschetta is the best I've ever had. The garlic knots are delicious and the margarita pizza is yummy! Excellent service! I'm Italian and very picky about Italian food and it's great here!"}
{"text":"Got the garlic Parmesan wings at the request of my girlfriend but wasn't disappointed. Had the pizza for the main course. Pretty plain Jane with the pepperoni but it was delicious. The crust is flaky yet full and I'm not typically a crust guy. Great overall meal and was happy they had some Four Peaks on draft to wash it all down."}
{"text":"Had baked ziti....huge portions low prices. The garlic knots are heaven. Waitress was friendly & efficient. A nice find!"}
{"text":"Our first visit here. The service was great. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. The location is priceless. Westgate  is a super fun place to hang out. Too bad the pizza wasn't so great. It tasted like a frozen pizza I could have cooked at home! Bland. Sauce was gross. Crust was thin and too soft. Its too bad. Given the location and competition... the pizza shod be much better! Too many other choices!"}
{"text":"Foodwise, this place has good pizza, the negative review is for the way the manager treated my son and I.  It was forth of July weekend and my son had to use the potty really bad (he is 3) and i went to go take my son into Mama Gina's and this blonde manager stopped me and said \"you have to buy something before your son can use the restroom,\" I looked at the huge line out of the door and said to her, \"I have to stand in line and wait to buy something for my 3 year old son to go to the bathroom?,\" the manager was like \"yes!\" In the rudest coldest voice.     I couldn't believe what I was hearing, my son was going to have an accident and she wouldn't let my little boy use the restroom because I hadn't paid for anything? That is just the rudest thing I've ever seen, and such mean customer service.  I responded to her and said \"wow! You are so sweet!\" And then I left confused and in disbelief... FYI if your son or daughter are playing at the splash pad and the bathrooms are full, Fresh Healthy Cafe has considerate and understanding management that will let your children use the restroom."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hot and Spicy BBQ traditional wings twelve each and the Veggie pizza (Mushrooms, onions, green peppers, black olives) and a Sprite drink.   It was my first time eating at this place, the waiters were friendly and respectful, a friendly environment to relax and chat with family and friends.   Overall, the Hot and Spicy BBQ wings were ok, could've had more sauce on the wings to give it more flavor, but it was good overall. The Veggie pizza, in the other hand nothing to complain about perfect and delicious."}
{"text":"My first time but probably won't return. We had a party of five and didn't get drinks or a waiter for about 20 minutes... then once we did order they gave us our drinks in plastic cups you get at Walmart... Our beer also was served in a plastic cup then we noticed people around us had glasses. So it was hit or miss, but once we did ask for a glass the server gave us attitude about it. We ordered a lot of food so the time in getting it was understandable. The prices we mild but I didn't feel like we got what we paid for. The pizza wasn't bad but the service and cheap plates, cups etc. wasn't a positive vibe."}
{"text":"I have been to Mama Gina's probably 5 times since it has opened and the food has been good, but every time the customer service is lacking. My waitress this time was fine, however, the manager, or whoever was in charge was turning away diners 45 minutes before the 9pm closing. I understand that restaurants have a closing time, however 45 minutes prior is ridiculous and I am sure they lose at least a couple hundred dollars each night that it happens. It is also terrible customer service to start turning away people who want to dine in starting at 8:15 pm. That is hardly late. If that were myself I would have not returned. Prior experiences have made me not return for 2 years. Service has been slow in the past and wait staff has not been very attentive to refill drinks or be quick for those going to movies. I really do like the food but the overall service every time I have been in has been terrible. I hope you don't close, but I feel like you will if you don't get it together."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great big portions. The staff was really nice. I found the prices to be fair with all other restaurants in this category. Great game day place! I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"The waiter was great, he brought us garlic knots at no cost for the kids! The pizza was really good an I'm from NY!"}
{"text":"This was the first time my family and I visited this pizza joint. The host was extremely friendly in his pizza costume, as he takes us to our table. It's cute inside and had tv's around to watch the game. We waited a few minutes and the server (he never said his name) asks us what to drink and tried to scurry away and I had to call him back in order fries for an appetizer. He seemed rushed. He drops our drinks and takes our order and twenty minutes later we are still waiting on our fries. We were there before other tables and they received fries, as well as, other menu items before us. While our server passes us four times, I had to ask how long fries take to come from the kitchen. He quickly goes to the computer and says he will check on it. Then, no less than a minute later our pizza arrives and five minutes minutes later my appetizer for my kid. The pizza was great, light crust and sauce with just the right amount of cheese and toppings. Can't complain about that. Our sever passes us seven times throughout our meal and never asks us if we needed refills or if we needed anything else. He was at the bar chatting or checking on a bigger party. We sit there waiting for him to come back to let him know we are ready for a box, then he asks, \"how is everything and I took the fries off your tab. It's a gift from the kitchen.\" A gift from the kitchen more than half way through our meal, thanks!!!!  Being in customer service/wait staff/bar industry and retail my entire life, I have never treated my customers like this. If you're going to be in this line of work, then work on your customer service skills, if you can't handle the stress of the job then find another one!   Not happy with the service."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza and the outside patio! Pizza was thin and not too much sauce, salad was a big portion with great flavor and my daughters chicken fingers were tasty too! Overall the service was adequate and food came out quickly. I would recommend it anytime."}
{"text":"Came on 1/1/16. Busy because just got out the Fiesta Bowl game.  Customer Service - Took 10 mins for waitress to acknowledge us, but again it was busy. Once she got to us, she took good care.  Salad - Just a regular chop up your local grocery store lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, onions, etc :/  Wings - Pretty good. We got the hot ones.  Spaghetti & meatballs - pretty good as well  I would come back to it if I was in the area."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and like to \"eat local\". There were only 4 other tables when we arrived and 5 or 6 staff standing around we waited 15-20 minutes after being seated before anyone came by. I was brought the wrong beverage the large Cesar salad came with 1 garlic knot for two of us and the pizza was just ok. I would not normally leave a yelp but the service was really shameful we won't be back this trip or any other."}
{"text":"Not bad for casual and quick. Had calzone  kinda pricy and small portions. But not bad"}
{"text":"Fun, friendly atmosphere! Servers were quick and attentive! Food was pretty good; Pizza was delicious. The only thing I would want more of, are bigger tables and a larger beer selection. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"THEY OVERCHARGE!!!!  Wow! What a bad bad first and last experience at Mama Gina's! We had a group of 4 adults and 3 children so not THAT confusing to handle and we didn't even ask for separate bills but still got overcharged. The waitress looked annoyed right from the start. Not sure why, they were almost empty. We got 2 pizzas, an order of wings and an order of chicken nuggets. Only one adult ordered a Sprite (the rest drank water) and 3 kids got apple juice. Guess what the bill was? $88!!!! Turned out their apple juice is $4.50 a piece and after I asked the waitress if it came with refills and she assured me that it did she still charged us for refills!  The service was bad, we had to wait forever and she stopped at our table maybe 4 times at the most, including the times she was taking drink and food orders.    It also turned out that they tuck in 18% automatic gratuity on the bill which is really hard to see so we ended up tipping her ON TOP of the 18% she didn't deserve to begin with.   As far as the food goes, the wings were ok, the pizza was blah. So definitely won't go back."}
{"text":"Mama Gina might know best, but isn't giving her BEST these days.  It was Valentine's Day afternoon and we opted to divert our stomachs to Mama Gina's Pizzeria to avoid the 30-45 minute wait at another popular restaurant in the same center.  This restaurant has so much potential to bring in lots of business with its high visibility and prime corner location at Westgate Entertainment District.    Mama Gina's advertises itself as 'specializing in hospitality and pizza'.  I agree with their latter claim, as their pizza was actually the one thing that saved this place from my giving them a lower rating.  Upon checking in on Yelp, I noticed the \"$1 for 20oz Fountain Drink\" offer and asked our server if I could redeem it.  She appeared bothered and said she'd HAVE to ask.  Seriously?!!  $1 won't even put a dent in our bill for a table of 7.  We had the New York style Mama's Supreme with sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, onions, mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese, which was quite good.  Loved the crust.   The Side House Salad, on the other hand, tasted like cafeteria salad with Blue Cheese dressing, mixed with watered down mayo(?).  I prefer pungent chunks of real blue cheese in my blue cheese dressing.  We shared a few dishes amongst our group of 7.   - Meat stuffed Ravioli with extra meatballs:  The pasta texture was a little on the doughy side, the meatballs not beefy enough in taste, and marinara sauce was mediocre at best. - Baked Ziti: Similar taste to their Ravioli, except the pasta itself was better prepared. - Mama's Antipasto Salad:  Mixed greens topped with sun-dried tomatoes, roasted peppers, artichoke hearts, red onion, olives with balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  It was good, but not as fresh as I'd expected.  Drinks were served in flimsy 20 oz plastic cups, left empty too long at times.  Our server seemed perturbed again, when we asked for refills.  She must have forgotten about us.  So, we asked another server for refills, who must have whispered to our server that our cups had been empty for some time now. Our server's demeanor changed for the better, but seemed forced.  She returned to our table with the scripted 'How is everything?' and 'Can I get anyone anything else?'   At the end of our meal, I was handed our bill.  I stared down at our $100+ receipt for a little bit and read below the total:  ***Review us on \"Yelp\" and get 50% off your next visit!!! (excluding alcohol)***    Three questions for the the owners or the Management.  1) Why would you risk including such a great offer on your receipt and not ensure that your staff puts out their BEST?  2) Will I still get 50% off our next visit, even if I give you a 2-star review?  3) Lastly, when is it appropriate to automatically add 18% gratuity?  We had a group of 7 people and the place was not busy, probably 3/4 empty.  I usually tip 20% everywhere, but your service was not even deserving of 18%.  We're only in town once a year, but even so, it's doubtful that we'll return to this restaurant to redeem our 50% off.  Advice:  Try to be your BEST at all times."}
{"text":"Seriously the most expensive pathetic pizza I've ever tasted.  Do not waste your time or money.  The crust had no flavor - the garlic knots tasted like dough.  The $25 Margherita pizza had grape tomatoes cut in half and a single leaf of basil on each slice.  Not even salt could add enough flavor to this tasteless meal."}
{"text":"We went for a quick lunch and so the kids could play in the water court.   We had pizza, ceasar salad and the garlic knots.  Wow everything was great.   The service, the food, and the atmosphere.   We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Don't want to sound rude but the food there is no good  worst chicken wings I ever try sorry I won't came back again"}
{"text":"Visiting Arizona with our travel ball team. In between games we go to Mama Gina's to eat. We ask the manager to change to channel to basketball and he tells us \"only if you move all the kids from the table so we can sit other customers\". Very rude and we spent $500!"}
{"text":"I like the Bruschetta. It is sooo good. The philly salad is really tasty. The chicken marsala is yummy."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I always recognize a great place to eat and I am on YELP to let people know when that happens.  Sad to say, this isn't one of those cases.  This is quite possibly the WORST dining experience I have ever had in my life.  My sister and I stopped in here to get something to eat before a concert this evening.  I ordered a meatball sub and my sister ordered boneless wings and a side salad.  The meatballs on this sandwich were clearly frozen, then thrown into a microwave oven, then some sad tomato sauce was thrown on top.  It was awful, tasteless and cold.  I WOULDN'T FEED THIS SANDWICH TO MY DOG.  Save your money, go to Subway for a meatball sub.  The meatball sub at Subway is twice as big, 12 inches and it has flavor, (for half the price of the 6 inch here with literally no flavor).  My sister advised her wings were mostly breading and absolutely disgusting.  We were hoping to stop in here and get a few slices before the show.  We were advised that between certain hours, this establishment doesn't offer slices.  BIG MISTAKE.  You are in a perfect position here \"Mama\", to serve slices to people who are on their way to concerts, sporting events, and the movie theater that sits adjacent to your location.  YOU ARE LOSING MONEY.  Terrible dining experience overall.  And they charged me $12.00 for a frozen, disgusting meatball sub.  Still reeling over that, seriously.  DO NOT EAT HERE EVER.  Get an education \"Mama\".  Your bartenders clearly need one too.  You don't serve a Blue Moon beer without a fresh slice of orange.  Do you have fresh produce?  I know your meat isn't fresh.  I had to post this immediately to stop people from getting lured into what they think might be a good meal.  You will thank me for passing it up.  There are several other establishments in the area that are better than this.  I have to say at least our server was nice and she was as accommodating as she could be under the circumstances.  The food here is GROSS!  As if this wasn't bad enough, the service was incredibly slow, we had to ask a young man who was cleaning a table next to us where our food was after soooo long.  If I could give this place less than zero stars, I WOULD.  You should be ashamed \"Mama\".  Close your doors and call Bar Rescue.  Your food is terrible and your bartenders don't have a clue."}
{"text":"I can't tell you about the food because we got up and left but let me tell you about the service. We got there after a coyotes game just to listen to \" Steve\" been condescending, telling us that the coupon I have was not valid on event night when actually it was. He was confrontational so we got up and left. Good luck in your life \" Steve \" you are going to need it."}
{"text":"The service from Megan was amazing she was the best server that we have had in a long time..the food was just OK, meatballs tasted like they were frozen and the garlic knots tasted like they may have been from the prior day... Penne was cooked perfectly but the sauce was just alright! This restaurant is very loud, but it was with the last one too so that has not changed...the owner stopped by our table to check on the service we were getting...not really asking about the food...our server on the other hand was very interested in what we thought of the food...we told her exactly! Hope that she relays the message to owner!"}
{"text":"Ok round two for this place and of course they did not disappoint. The food was just as good and the service was awesome. Hidie and the staff were all amazing and so sweet sending us over a cookie and ice cream treat \"yum\" and thank you. The place was pretty full and we still got great service I still highly recommend this place (ask for Hidie) because the pizza and wings are the bomb. With that said breakfast pizza and wings are waiting for me so tootles :)"}
{"text":"Depending on the day, the food can be good, it is not consistent at all.  Customer Service is absolutely terrible, they will not even let you sit a party, even as small as 3, until the entire party has arrived, even when the place is empty! Warm beer and slow service, dont waist your time here!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast and excellent service HEATHER was an additional pleasure making sure everything was satisfactory. Will certainly come back and explore the menu!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to go and have a good time with friends!! Dylan the manager made our night!! We planned on going to a movie but had such a great time at Mama Gina's we stayed for more. I suggest this to anyone looking for fun with friends and the staff. They are interested in current situations and making sure the customers are first and have a good time. The drinks are great and the appetizers work well. Thank you Mama Gina's for making our night!"}
{"text":"If you want good customer service, such wonderful waitresses. The food not so pleased. I was hoping to a slice or two but you have to purchase the whole pizza. And the portions are too large there is no small, medium, large; only large. One other good thing is that you can half the salad instead of getting a full large one. I ordered wings and they were not bad. Not as good as Wingstop but I could eat them again. I will not be returning but wanted to write this review for others deciding to go here."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Good environment. Speedy service. Great if you enjoy New York style pizza. The classic pizza was great, the Hawaiian pizza was very good. The best selection could be improved upon, but it was decent."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone to this place twice now. First time we went was with a group of 10-12 people. Which regardless if it was just us 2 or all 12 of us we had great customer service!!   They made sure we had everything we needed, which we did. Its great when you can see everyone gets along as if they were family and when they can laugh with the owner, which he came by and made sure everything was going well.   This place is definitely a place where I will be returning the food was excellent and the customer service is always great and I would gladly recommend this place to any friend or family member!"}
{"text":"The food was decent,  but,  it was really dirty in there!  The bathrooms are dirty,  the floors everywhere are dirty.  We sat outside and there was old food outside on the floor,  dirty utensils in the ground.  Yuck.  Makes it uncomfortable to relax and eat."}
{"text":"As an employee of one of the nearby arenas, I chose Mama Gina's on a night where I was stuck at work late and needed to pick up a quick bite. I went in with a friend and we both ordered to go. Both of us got hot sandwiches- I got the chicken parm. After ordering and paying, we were told that we could have a seat in the dining area while we wait. What was supposed to be a quick dinner-run ended up being about a 30 minute wait to get our food. I ordered a drink to go and had to wait the whole thirty minutes before even getting my cup to fill up. Very annoying. The food really even wasn't that good, and the chicken tasted similar to that of Lean Cuisine chicken parm. Overall, pretty disappointed with Mama Gina's. I've heard the pizza is pretty good here, but I wouldn't have any experience to vouch for it."}
{"text":"We had a late lunch, so it wasn't too crowded, we were seated quickly and our server was great. Food was just ok... Garlic knots were inconsistent (some good, some too hard), the Cheesesteak was small compared to the other entrees that we ordered."}
{"text":"This review is for Friday July 1st.  We tried them for the second time we got there pizzas 2 both were to have extra cheese and light sauce. The pizzas both had a lot of sauce o. Them when we finally got out waters attention and told him he said \"Well you did NOT tell me you wanted light sauce so that's how it comes our sauce is the best what would you like me to do have remade now?\" I told him well I told you twice light sauce maybe if you wrote it down you would remembered. I asked how long it would be to have them remake it and he said they are busy so probably 20 min or more. We told him for get it because we had plans we tried taking the sauce off with a knife but it was making a mess and felt dumb so we just did not eat there and left. He asked if we wanted to take it with us. No we did not want a ton of sauce we dud not like them. We left 2 almost whole pizzas and hungry will not be back no discount sorry nothing at all."}
{"text":"My family came for a conference and their hotel was near Mall .. we all decided pizza sounded good so we stopped by Mama Gina's .. service was quick and friendly and waitress was attentive to our needs ... pizza was good and the atmosphere was as friendly and nice as could be .. no complaints at all ... The manager came out before we left and checked in with us to see how everything was .. Worth a stop if you are craving a nice slice of pie .. would recommend sitting outdoors .. it was very comfortable!!"}
{"text":"Food was 10/10. Our server Pao was amazing. Our pizza was crispy like we asked .   Wings were extra wet"}
{"text":"So glad we stopped here!  We were actually impressed with how they handled an event crowd.  We came in for a few beers and food prior to a concert and enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  Mike the bartender was very nice and attentive, he nor anyone were annoyed that people were there prior to the concert which is refreshing.  They appreciated the business!  We had the appetizer sampler because we didn't want to get to full but we can't wait to return to try there massive sandwiches and fresh looking pasta!  Give it a try...."}
{"text":"We've dined here 2 times.  Honestly the food is good-no complaints there.  But it's also nothing special.  The place itself is a casual pizza joint, nice patio. I recently dined at lunchtime.  I saw 'pizza by the slice' and asked which kinds were available to be told about the special, which was a slice, side salad and drink for a whopping $7.50.  Then my antipasto salad was delivered without dressing (miscommunication on the server's part) but I let it slide as it tasted good without it and I didn't want to bother them.  The thing that chaps my hide was when I asked for a side of ranch they charged me 60 cents.  You think they would have let that slide since THEY forgot the dressing for my salad.  Their kids meals are way overpriced.  Now, I am not cheap but places like this make me feel like I am because I get irritated when they charge too much or for things that should be included!  There's  a place down the street whose lunch 'special' is 3 bucks cheaper.  Guess I'll stick with that"}
{"text":"We stopped by after ice skating. We got the pizza and wings special. Great food for a good price!"}
{"text":"What's up to all you Yelpers out there? I recently came across this place yesterday as me, my girlfriend, and her daughter came out of the AMC theater at Westgate. This place must have just opened up this week as it was still closed last week when I was at Westgate. Now I want you to keep in mind that this place just opened when u go in. There isn't really anything about the look of the place that makes it stand out from any other place. The people genuinely seemed excited for us when we came in the place so that's good. Our waiter I didn't catch his name but he didn't seem to comfortable, he seemed kind of nervous. I had the Stromboli which I thought was pretty good. My girl had the greek salad, it was ok. The chicken that came on it seemed a bit dry. Her daughter had chicken tenders with french fries. She kept yelling saying how delicious it was so if u got a 4yr old go with the chicken tenders. I had a word with the person who brought our food because a couple of the chicken tenders look like as if they were bitten. They manager came out and offered to replace the meal but we didn't because she wasn't going to eat all of her meal anyways so what's one less chicken tender. We also ordered some garlic knots but we never got them. But I probably would have had I remembered then myself instead of hours later once I got home. But I guess that sums up r meal there at Mama Gina's. It was ok, but nothing really that makes it a \"must eat\" place. But I would recommend it if u happen to be at Westgate despite how my review comes across. Its just not a place that I would go out of my way to eat at. But I will give them the benefit of the doubt since they just opened this week and might need a bit of time to get situated and hit their stride. So I will probably wait and check it out again in a few months. The building its in has already been about 3 other places since Westgate open. So hopefully this place can stick around for awhile."}
{"text":"Had lunch on a Sunday afternoon with a group of four.  Pizza was good not great.  We also ordered the garlic knots, again good not great.  The service was good/fast/professional.  All in all it was good."}
{"text":"This place is located within the Westgate shopping complex. My wife and I went a few weeks ago because we were given a gift certificate to go. It was our first time, and we probably won't be going back.  To start our waitress was clueless about almost everything. She seemed flustered by our drink order, and when she asked what kind of dressing I'd like for my salad I told her oil and vinegar (a staple for any Italian restaurant). That threw her for a loop, and I had to actually explain to her what I wanted. She went away and came back twice trying to figure it out before finally bringing it. Secondly my wife and I both ordered eggplant Parmesan. Now they have too eggplant Parmesan dishes, one with pasta, one a sandwich. She assumed we meant the sandwich and brought that out. When we informed her it was incorrect she began arguing with us about how that is the only eggplant Parmesan dish they had. I told her she was incorrect and she disappeared again, came back and said she put the new order in. When it came out the marinara sauce was ok, nothing special, but the eggplant was a little overly breaded. To top it off, usually, when a dish gets sent back (let alone 2), at most places a manager comes over and apologizes. That would have gone a long way. Instead I noticed who I could only assume was the manager, or possibly owner, usher a young couple in and try to bend over backwards to please them. All the while ignoring us. Now it's possible our clueless waitress didn't inform him about our predicament, in which case that is sad, and he needs to pay closer attention to what is going on around him. Oh, and the bread knots many people rave about, I wasn't impressed. They tasted like they had been left out at least a day, were stale, and warmed up. If other places are busy and this place isn't give it a shot, your experience may be different than ours, but we probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"The service was terrible! When I asked for ranch dressing for my calzone as I waited for the calzone to arrive. The waitress grabbed the ranch from my coworkers appetizer and gave it to me.  I guess he didn't want it according to the waitress, cause he was not asked. Then my calzone that I ordered came and it was the wrong calzone. I didn't have time during my lunch break to wait while they cooked another.   When she picked up my other coworkers empty plate of buffalo wings she asked if I wanted the rest of his ranch dressing (streaks of buffalo sauce in it) .  Then at bill time I have her a $20 for a $13.21 lunch and waited for my change. She gave me back only $6- no change, so I included the missing change in the tip amount I left to make a %15 tip even though service was terrible. And got cursed at while leaving.  The food is good but they need to make a serious change in wait staff. If I remembered her name I would have added it to this review."}
{"text":"Had a group of 14 people planning on going to Monster Jam at U of Phoenix stadium. Called Mama Gina's two weeks ahead of time to see if we could get a reservation. They told us they don't take reservations when there are events at the stadium but it would not be a problem as we were coming in at 5:30. I got there at 4:30 to secure a table, told the that there were 14 of us.  She said no problem, and when i asked if she needed my name, she said no. I sat at the bar for a while and noticed her taking names down for other parties.  Went to check, and my name was not on the list. So, I was told it would be 45-60 minutes. My party had arrived by that time, there was no place to wait and everyone was ahead of us.  Meanwhile, tables were not being bused and the managers were running around looking like they had no idea what to do.  Finally decided to go elsewhere.  No idea what the food was like..."}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick bite and I ordered a chicken parmigiana sub and my husband ordered a Philly cheesesteak sub. My chicken was sooo awful, it had a weird obscure taste....like rotten, dirty water, metallic taste. It tasted nothing like chicken parmigiana should. It was super over fried, i had just pieces of friend skin in my sub. It was awful!!! My husbands Philly cheese steak also had  this weird taste.   The waitress noticed I ate about 1/4 of the meal but just took it away when I said I was done. Didn't ask me if there was something wrong...... Nothing. Well. I will never ever be back there, take it from me, I hate leaving bad reviews but I work hard for my money and hate bad food.   I later woke up at night and got super sick. Sucked."}
{"text":"At Westgate for the USA vs Colombia match and m daughters wanted pizza. We decided to try Mama Gina's were so glad we did! This pizza is awesome!! Get in here and have some today, today!!!"}
{"text":"We ate here tonight and thought it was pretty good.  We tried the garlic bread with cheese and the mozzarella sticks.  Both were good!  We also tried the BBQ chicken pizza.  The bbq sauce was a little heavy.  We liked the pizza but thought it was a bit overpriced.  It would have been nice if there was more than one size to order.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  The sandwiches people around us had ordered looked good!"}
{"text":"Came here one night after a Coyote's game, I was pleasantly surprised. I had a stromboli and it was fantastic. The dough was chewy and crispy (now THAT'S skill) and had been brushed with herbs and butter. The filling was meaty and cheesy. I stuffed the entire thing in my stomach even after I was full because it was THAT good. Service was decent."}
{"text":".bad bad bad and bad!!!! Chicken parmesan was a warm roll fried chicken piece small a little cheese and bland sauce.and and a mound of tasteless fries fries for $10.00. We asked what the prices  of the beers were and she had no idea and the waitress said she had only been there a few months and didn't know the prices. They don't have a ber list or prices available to view as she said they were more of a bar?  Really? Don't go don't go don't go!!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited here on 10-22-16, a busy Saturday night at Westgate.  We were seated almost immediately.  Server was fine.  My disappointment was with the margherita pizza, usually one of our favorites.  I've never had a margherita pizza like this.  Instead of thin, succulent slices of red tomatoes, halves of cherry tomatoes were dropped on the pie!  And not too many of those, either.  Instead of chiffonaded basil, or chopped basil, sprinkled across the pie, one large leaf was placed in the middle of each slice.  I had to tear each leaf into pieces by hand in order to properly distribute them across each piece so I could get that wonderful basil flavor in each bite.  The sauce was bland, more sweet like Oreganos rather than a real Italian taste.  The crust was okay.  Upon a return to Westgate Entertainment Center we'll be looking for another place to spend our food dollars."}
{"text":"Seriously...get rid of the microwaves. I feel like I'm on an episode of kitchen nightmares. My husbands food came out just wrong. Not even what he ordered. Mine....well I bent my fork trying to cut my GARLIC BREAD! And to top it off, I had ice in my salad (all in the photos I am posting) and my little girl had soup for sauce instead of pasta sauce. They didn't drain the pasta. Horrible food. And really, are you a sports bar or a pizza joint or an Italian Restaurant. OMG."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately I won't be returning.  The customer service is STELLAR. I can't stress this enough. They went above and beyond to accommodate and did so with a smile. Fat tip for them!  The outside patio is great, especially during this time of the year. It's spacious and a delight for people who like to look at something other than a wall, as you can see all of Westgate from their patio.  Food and drinks... this is where they lost me. Pizza has absolutely NO flavor. Mozzarella sticks had no cheese on the inside. Wings were decent but nothing special. They don't serve margaritas because there's no blender... I thought that was interesting.   The bill came out to $75 for one pizza, wings and a sampler. It just wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Mama Gina's has the best pizza in Glendale. If you're going to the coyotes game or any events in the Westgate area make sure you pay a visit here. I always get The Hawaiian pizza and 12 honey hot wings and they are always hot and fresh when they come out. The staff is always friendly and they are so quick to get you what you need. The bald guy who is the manager is hilarious and should be on the cover of some magazine headliner \"BEST PIZZA IN TOWN!\"   Overall great experience and a find myself craving their pizza.   If you are a veggie lover, they have an absolutely amazing salad as well as garlic knots."}
{"text":"Mama Gina's is nicely situated near the middle of Westgate.  Their menu mostly consists of pizza, subs, and pasta.  The interior is pretty basic but the patio (when it's cool enough) is roomy and it gives a little hint of Italy.    Out of their entire menu, I can speak to the subs, pizzas, and appetizers.  Their subs are tasty and filling and the appetizers (especially the Bruschetta) are pretty good and have a homemade taste.  The pizzas, however, are not very good.  For instance, the 16'' is dry, ultra thin, and not very filling.  If you are a fan of Papa John's, I'm pretty sure that you'll agree.  There are plenty of discounts too.  I bought a certificate through my work where I pay $5 and get $15, but have to spend at least $22.  So, after the math, $12 for $22 worth of food (excluding the pizzas) isn't bad (except for the first time I tried to use the coupon and they wouldn't let me use it because it was a Football Sunday even though it stated nothing to that affect on the certificate).  You can also get 20% off with your AMC movie ticket.  They also have some decent specials, but I can recall them... so, I'll update this review a bit in the future."}
{"text":"I NEVER give 5 stars. EVER! I am here because it is that good. I'm picky. To the extreme of picky. The only complaint I have is I want to keep eating. I'm miserably full and have to box my leftovers to stop. It is filling, large portions for the price and the food is out of this world. Our server, Joey, is super friendly. He's prompt and attentive without the annoying qualities of some servers. I WILL be back even though I live an hour away. See you all soon!!"}
{"text":"We came for a business trip to Glendale and stayed at the Renaissance Hotel in the West Gate area. My girlfriend was craving pizza and a caesar salad. Yelp helped to find this location within walking distance of our hotel.   Well she was super happy, the pizza was delicious and the cheese was great, we ordered the 16\" Mamas Supreme pizza. We have left overs for tomorrow..!! Love cold left over cold pizza.! Yum.!   The salad was ok, I have had better butthe pizza was definitely worth coming for a return visit...   Service was great, the waiter attentive.   I gave this place 4 stars only because the sale was ok.!! It's ok, I think they can easily improve on the salads."}
{"text":"Great service and casual environment. Daughter loved the kids spaghetti and meatballs. Son liked the Italian sandwich. Delicious pizza.   Came on a Wednesday night and it was busier than expected, but service was ready."}
{"text":"Ok, so I have lived in Westgate for sometime now and finally decided to give this place a try.  Ordered 6 wings to try them out and a pie.   The service was prompt and friendly and the place was clean and well staffed.  The wings were obviously frozen wings with Franks Red Hot poured on them.  Considering Native New Yorker is across the street, it didnt seem like they put any effort into them.  The pizza was one of the worst I have had.  The crust was burned in some places and the dough was raw in the middle.  The pizza had a very weird soapy taste, almost as if the pizza was made on a pan that still had dishwater on it.$32 for 6 sub par wings and 1 nasty pizza was not ok.  So dissapointed as I was hoping ti have a good place I could walk to.  I wouldnt come back."}
{"text":"And the Worst Customer Service Award in Phoenix goes to...  Mama Gina's.  I don't even know where to start. I'm pretty fair in how I rate businesses on Yelp (check out my other reviews), but let me just say that this place belongs on Kitchen Nightmares.   I had purchased a number of restaurant.com certificates to this place, and used a few of them awhile back. The pizza was...okay, but time had passed and we decided to give it another try and use up the remaining certificates I'd purchased. So we entered the restaurant, and first thing, let them know that we would be dining on one of these restaurant.com certificates to which they had no problem. They took down the numbers and sat us at a table. The server asked us what we'd like to order so we went with their white pie, as we remembered that being the better of the pizzas we'd tried last time. He walked away, and returned minutes later to inform us that our certificates were no longer valid and asked what we'd like to do. We told him to give us a moment to think about it, and he left us there to go over our options. We had a Groupon purchase with Opa Life, right across the courtyard, so we decided to go that route instead. We packed up and were about to leave, assuming that he put a hold on the order, when he approaches us with the pizza we told him to hold off on. He realized he'd made a mistake and nervously returned the pizza to the kitcken.   As we were on our way out the door, a woman we can only guess was the on-duty manager yells at us from across the restaurant to stay put. She approaches us and let's us know that she is going to call security on us. We are in a moment of shock, and explained the situation to her, which she should have fully understood as she was the same person we'd given the certificates to in the first place. BUT she continued to cause a scene, and told us that she'll \"let us go\", and that she would normally call security on people who don't pay for their food. Ummm, we hadn't even touched the pizza, nor did we have any intention of ordering it after discovering the certificates I'd purchased online were no longer valid. As for the server, he denied ever coming over to our table and being told to give us a moment.   What a ridiculous scenario this was. I've eaten at many restaurants here in the valley, mostly pleasant experiences, and never in my wildest would have pictured a manager (?) confronting and threatening to call security for deciding not to dine there. It was clearly their mistake, and they turned their mistake into an embarrassing and completely uncalled for situation. I'll never step foot in this business again, and I will make sure anyone I know who may consider dining here thinks twice about it.  ----------------------------UPDATE------------------------------  In response to manager/owner Lisa's reply:  Lisa, you are absolutely right that it was a simple misunderstanding. The problem is that a simple misunderstanding turned into an accusatory and embarrassing situation. We should have been free to exit the restaurant without being pulled into a dramatic scene initiated by a staff member.  When the server approached us minutes after ordering to inform us that the certificates, that we had explained upon entering the restaurant that we'd be dining on, were invalid, and asked us what we'd like to do, we told him verbatim, \"Give us a few minutes to think it over. Thank you.\" That should have put a halt on the order and the awkwardness that followed. Businesses usually practice a \"customer is always right\" type of environment, and I don't always agree with it, but this incident was the polar opposite of that concept; initiated by the staff and escalated when they confronted and threatened us in front of other customers. I've eaten at many restaurants. I've seen good customer service, mediocre, and bad. This was the equivalent of things we'd seen on the Amy's Baking Company episode of Kitchen Nightmares."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good pizza restaurants in Glendale and found Mama Gina's.  We ordered a cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza and a specialty pizza.  They were all awesome!  The atmosphere was great, with a nice patio and the staff was very friendly.  We will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"First time being here for a hockey game. It's nice to see the manager/owner being so helpful with the staff. Great customer service, amazing food! We had the homemade bbq sauce wings-yum! And the Philly cheesesteak! The guy next to us at the bar said it was the best meatball hero he's had in the valley! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The staff are nice and the restaurant is nicely kept. The food is ok nothing out of this world. The prices are to expensive and the menu is limited. I will not be visiting this place again"}
{"text":"Do not go! Only went because everything was 2 hour wait due to a Cardinals game. There was zero wait here, I know why. $24 for a margarita pizza. It was awful! Only ate 1 piece and left the rest there to toss. The crust tastes like flour only. The tomatoes were squishy. Roma tomatoes not sliced on this pizza is a stupid choice. $4 a soda, seriously?? The sampler was very good but mostly French fries for the $17 price. The mild wings were very good. Pricy but good. $77 bill, wasted. Will never return."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight for the first time and really enjoyed it. Great Chicken Picatta, garlic knots and very good Tiramisu!   Staff was very friendly and it was a small, quant place. I will go back for sure! Also enjoyed a $1 soft drink by checking in on Yelp!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre food.  I had a meatball sub which had more cheese than sauce. And the meatballs had no flavor - as if they were frozen and just thawed. It was just not what I expected. Maybe if we had the pizza they would've gotten more stars. It was just too expensive."}
{"text":"Service is friendly but the table are pretty squishy.  The small table for two has condiments and a pizza holder which barely leaves room for two plates.  We ordered the antipasto salad and the meatball sub.  Honestly I can make a better antipasto salad.  The meatball sub was a bland as bland can be.   I would have liked to try the pizza but they only server 16\"."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. Salads were bland! My meal for 2 people was 45.00$ a little overpriced. Go to grimaldis its better all around"}
{"text":"The food was ok. It was very slow when we walked in and only 2 customers showed during our lunch. Very nice staff and the decor was nice. The price of the lunch special would be a better value at $3.99 based on the flavor and quality. The eggplant was decent, quite certain it was frozen and then deep fried. I would not go back but it's worth giving a try. Good amount of food for the price."}
{"text":"This had to be the worst restaurant experience of my life. Took so long for us to get food that we asked them to give it to us to go. Then we were informed that half of the order was not even put in. This would be an additional wait if we wanted it. So we decided to cancel that part of the order and take what was ready. So we get home and what they gave us was not what we ordered. Called the restaurant and they were of no assistance and told my wife to have a nice day and hung up on her. Great customer service. I didn't mention that it took 50 minutes before we decided to get the food to go. Do not even bother going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service !! A must try!! The wings were amazingly good , try the \"hot\" sauce !! Ask for the waitress Justine , she was very helpful!!"}
{"text":"The Burchette  was amazing... TRY IT!! I also had the pizza which was delicious. Everyone had a friendly smile on their face and I enjoyed myself very much. I will definitely be eating there again."}
{"text":"Waiting for more than 10 minutes to be greeted. Then to get bloody wings. Then to sit through a drought for more water. Frozen pizza? Seemed like it. I wish there was a half star rating."}
{"text":"Another Friday happy hour at Mama Ginas. We kept our date every week with Sammy, Dylan, Joey, Brandon and crew. We love our new family and one can't beat Sammys new creations every week. Thanks to each of you. You all make our weekend great. Of course 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced and the food is fantastic!  I took some pizza home and a week later it was still amazing!  The service is all smiles! Truly is a gem! Go there, eat there, love it there!"}
{"text":"Golly, I would tell people not to go here. I simply ask for four pizzas, two with pepperoni, one with olives, and one with pineapple. They gave me only two pizzas, one with pepperoni and olives, the other with pepperoni and pineapple. I can't eat meat. I was with another person, who didn't mind the other topping on his pepperoni. I went back to let them know they made a mistake. I was charged for two more pizzas one with only olives and one with only pineapple. I saw someone tell the cook, how the pizzas should be made. Once I got my two pizzas, they had pepperoni with olives and pepperoni with pineapples. AGAIN! I was on lunch, there was no point for asking to fix this problem again because I had to go back to work. Brought it up to them, ask them if I could just get my money back since I can't eat the pizzas they made me. I was told I could not get my money back only credit. I don't want credit because that was my lunch money to eat. I was told by the employees,\"mistakes happen.\" After I ask for my money back. Which I understand mistakes do happen, I work in customers service too. But when I see an employee tell the cook how the pizzas should be made, one with only olives and one with only pineapple, and both pizzas still end up having pepperoni on it. That's not just a mistake. Which I still have the receipt that's says cheese pizzas with olives and pineapple."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Penne pasta was over peppered. Paid my bill and gratuity by credit card only to discover when the pending charge cleared that someone added an extra $1 to the gratuity. After reading the other reviews, it's not worth my time or drive to dispute it. I hate to think how many other customers were overcharged in that manner. So beware of you are using your debit or credit cards there."}
{"text":"Pizza definitely worth a visit.  However, our waiter was unfriendly. Not sure he wore up on the wrong side of the bed or his girlfriend just dumped him. Whatever the reason or reasons, he needs to understand he is in the service business."}
{"text":"Don't even bother. Very generic, tasteless pizza. If I have to actually use the parmesean and crushed red pepper, you're not doing it right.    Plenty of other options in Westgate."}
{"text":"My youngest son and I ate here. The pizza was cold, flavorless and gross. A frozen Totino's pizza would have out shined this pizza. We also had wings and I couldn't even eat all  of those. There are other choices at Westgate. The cook and whoever is running the kitchen need help and a reality check. Look at, temperature check and taste food before you send it out people! Quality control is everything!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here, our server Steven was really helpful and recommend the special wings and pizza.. my girl is prego so she can't eat spicy wings gave us a recommendation of half and half on the wings! The pizza was good we got a sausage and cheese pizza... they had all the game on and the music from out side made it really cool experience!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. $26.00 for a pizza that only came in one size, and $14.00 for a caesar salad that was clearly old--all the lettuce edges were red. The lady at the counter said the owner jacks up the prices because it's the only pizza place at Westgate!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food! Large portions.  The sampler platter is HUGE. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"I was SO excited to try their pizza! I ordered a personal pizza and they said they were out of  the size of dough for the personal pizza....even though the menu says \"hand tossed\" my only option was to order a large pizza. Since a large pizza was too big for one person i went with the chicken marsala......the sauce was good but the chicken was like rubber, the knife was actually bending while i was trying to cut it. I took one bite and decided I would speak to a manager, all he did was apologize take my food and bring me my check. The chicken marsala was served with a side of pasta drizzled with oil and garnished with a little parmasan cheese, nothing special....not to mention the pasta was wayyyyy overcooked and soggy. Service was terrible, food was worse!"}
{"text":"ok..here's the deal..got the margherita pizza. The curst was good but the sauce was very watery and they could have used more cheese. They saved the day with a free birthday dessert."}
{"text":"This is the real deal folks. I'm picky about my pizza after having been to Manhattan and had the pizza there many times. Mama Gina's does it right. The staff are friendly and quick and Sammy behind the bar is a real gentleman. Oh and the pizza....it's delicious! Five big stars. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Terrible food. Soggy and undercooked, no understanding of the problem.  Took 30 minutes to get an undercooked pizza. Had our money refunded the food was so terrible."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent! The restaurant was clean, the service attentive, the hostess, waitress and the rest of the staff were friendly and fun. We went the Mama Gina's a week ago, ordered four pizzas (meat lover's, hawaiian, margherita and bbq chicken) and an appetizer sampler, and everything was fresh, hot and tasted great. The fries are addictive; crispy-crunchy outside, tender inside. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was totally not busy. The service was totally fine but the food was just okay.  I ordered the bruschetta and it came with at least two cartons of baby tomatoes-it was overloaded. My husband got a meatball sub which was loaded beyond belief with cheese. The chicken tenders meal was okay but a bit greasy for my daughter. We also got wings but had to pay extra for the ranch and blue cheese. Perhaps we will try it again and order something else."}
{"text":"We are in town for our first Spring training visit.  We walked over to the Westgate entertainment district. Italian sounded good so we stopped by to check this place. Everyone here was really nice.  We ordered the sampler appetizer which had a variety of food. Everything tasted good, but I think it's time to change or filter the oil everything was the same color and a little on the overdone side.   Our order of traditional wings had good flavor, but also were overcooked and crispy. The pepperoni pizza.... Average at best. They didn't tell us they ran out of garlic knots until we asked why we were given garlic bread.   This is our 2nd night in Glendale and will probably be back next year...we might give this place another go."}
{"text":"Had a great meal even though we had really rude people next to us. Great drinks as well had a $5 margarita and the bbq chicken pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza taste terrible. Someone needs to go to culinary school. It was a waste of time and money. If you are looking for great service and delicious food don't waste your time or your taste buds here."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and was disappointed. Waited a long time for a small pizza which I believe it was overprice and when we got it , all the bottom pizza was burnt! We did not return it since we waited so long and we were only able to eat at least one slice!"}
{"text":"The food was great. We had pizza and spaghetti, basic Italian food but the flavor was great. I gave 4 stars because our waitress wasn't the best."}
{"text":"The positives: staff was friendly and the beer was cold. That's it.   Two kids spaghetti and meatballs was disappointing. Noodles were cooked fine, the meatballs were small and bland, and the sauce was runny and wasn't nearly enough to coat half the noodles let alone the entire plate. And for $6 each that's ridiculous.    We order the Mama's Supreme pizza. The order took well over 30 min for the pizza. Half the crust was burnt. The toppings were limited and the flavor was blah.    Very disappointed and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Waiter was awesome she was very friendly and on top of her tables, pizza was the best pizza I've had in awhile, I'm not a huge crust fan at all and here I ate the crust, absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here before a concert so it was super busy, yet our service was super fast and efficient. My only complaint is that there was only one size pizza on the menu so we had to throw away over half since you cannot take outside food in to the concert venue. Given that two different stadiums are within walking distance and neither allow outside food having different size pizza options would be better. Otherwise, the food was good and the service was quick!"}
{"text":"They gave me food poisoning?.  Went there mid-evening? around five? on a friday.  There where 10 employees just standing around chatting with one another, while there might have been 6 guests in the whole restaurant.  My drink went empty three times an I had to flag down our waitress each time just to get a refill.  Meanwhile,? the other baker's?? dozen of employees? just stood around watching us.  It was creepy.    For two soft drinks and a pizza it was 40 dollars, would have had better food and a nicer atmosphere? at Costco? for 1/4 the cost.  Plus Costco has never given? me food born illness."}
{"text":"ill keep it simple. pizza doesn't taste fresh. seems like you're eating at an elementary school. the stock cheese just separates and leaves you with nothing but a layer of crust with no flavor. the pepperoni has no flavor. the waiter was very friendly and seemed genuine about giving us the best customer service possible even  when we let him know the pizza was horrible. nonetheless i would never come here again unless they get fresh dough, fresh vegetables, fresh everything. maybe they should call Chef Ramsay to bring in his squad to film Kitchen Nightmares. all joking aside dont waste your money. oh by the way, the manager took care of us and the 3 slices we ate (me my wife and 4 yr old) out of the pizza pie were on the house. i tipped the waiter cuz he did a great job at keepin his cool bein the best. other than that i dont see this place succeeding."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like waiting for an hour at Yardhouse so we ventured on over to Mama Gina's where there was no wait. The service wasn't the greatest, but I think they may have been understaffed that night. Nonetheless, we ordered an order of garlic knots and a large pepperoni pizza for the four of us. Both were quite delicious! I would return if in the area and craving pizza again!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all. There was a hockey game and we were going to see a movie and this place..well was pretty empty so we thought it was our luck, we walked in and first impression: the hostess stand was in the middle after having to enter the building and walk past the tables...than the hostess, was kinda snippy asking us inside and out, we chose inside and than with and wave of her hand she says well than just sit anywhere and walks away from us...our waiter was just as bland and snippy. 3 dollars for a little tiny sprite that comes in a plastic cup, food was bland and WAY to overpriced...and than again with the employees...and gain of them were gathered and in one corner gossiping and very innapropriately grabbing each other andgainllround rolling up towels and hitting each other with them and remarking how one bit the other a few nights ago...I'm all for having fun at work but come on keep it professional people. Please. We won't be back and recommend to others that there are many better places to go for food and service in this area, if it looks empty it's for good reason.."}
{"text":"While reading other reviews, it seemed they either loved or hated it.  Well, we loved it!  We decided to head over here for a late lunch/early dinner.  In Westgate, we try to go during off times, since it gets so crowded during the weekends.  This was the perfect time to show up, around 4ish.  We found a spot out front and it wasn't busy inside.  As we were finishing, more people were starting to file in...good sign.  I'd read about the garlic knots, so we decided to start with them.  Firstly...they're HUGE!  Hubby and I looked at each other and couldn't believe how big they were.  They serve 6 of them, along with a side of marinara.  Secondly...they're really good!  They were hot and garlicky, and the marinara sauce was really tasty and light with them.  For our main courses, I went with the lasagna.  Because, when asking about different entrees, when I mentioned it, Justine's (our very friendly waitress) face lit up.  I could tell she really like it, as well.  Hubby went with the chicken parmesan with a side of spaghetti.  Both the entrees came with a salad, as well as an additional garlic knot.  The salads were cool and crispy, very fresh and big.  That seemed to be a theme here...the portions are really big!  My lasagna was so tasty, hot and melty...just how I like it.  And, the chicken parm was also very good, since hubby allowed me to have a taste.    I ended up only eating half of mine, and taking home the rest, along with 2 garlic knots.  Hubby was able to eat his whole meal, although he seems incredibly full right now...LOL!  The staff seemed very friendly...always smiling.  And, Justine was a very sweet and attentive server.  We will definitely be back...and next time, we'll be expecting a really BIG meal!!"}
{"text":"Wings were good , Caesar was okay. Waited a while to get a server but got one. Will come back. Nothing else was out of place. Was very upset I couldn't get just one slice of pizza on a Sunday. They said they only have that offer for couple of hours Monday through Friday . They just have that all the time to bring more business , nobody want to buy a whole pizza without knowing how good or bad it tastes ."}
{"text":"After having a disastrous time at Saddle Ranch(see my other review), we decided to try another restaurant in Westgate and went to Mama Gina's.    We walked in, asked if they could handle a party of 7, and they said they could.  We were seated almost immediately and our drink order was taken.    When you go to Mama Gina's website, they have a tab for specials.  On Sundays, there are a choice of 2; either a 16\" cheese pizza for $10, or a family feast of pasta, salad, and garlic knots for $20.  When I asked our server(name of Hung) about the specials, he said there were none.  Here's the website if anyone is interested in checking this out:  http://mamaginaspizzeria.com  We ordered a Margherita pizza, a kids chicken tenders, and 3 soft drinks(since there were 2 families, we each placed our own order; hence only 1 pizza and 3 drinks).  The food came from the kitchen disjointedly.  Our son's chicken tenders and fries, and our part of our friends order came out first.  The chicken tenders(2), were the typical Sysco style deep freeze chicken tenders and came with a mountain of fries that looked good.  When our pizza showed up, it was covered in sliced cherry tomatoes.  Nowhere on the menu, does it say that the pizza has sliced tomatoes on it. Here is what the menu states:   Margherita Tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, fresh garlic and olive oil  I have had Margherita pizza either with sliced tomatoes or with tomato sauce.  I prefer it with tomato sauce.  If you're going to put sliced tomatoes on it, please put that on your menu!  Never saw or tasted the garlic; and the basil was not what I'd call fresh.  The crust tasted as if it had been made ahead of time and frozen.  As for the pizza, it was ok.  IMHO, better than Totino's or some other frozen variety; but in no way was it worth almost $20.    So...after some deep freeze chicken tenders, a mediocre pizza, and 3 soft drinks; we got the bill.  $40.22 including the City of Glendale's 10%+ sales tax rate.  At $20.00, I might come back, but at $40.00?  No way!  Too many other good pizza choices for the same or less $$.  Grimaldi's is only about a mile or so away, and their pizza is light years ahead of Mama Gina's, and about the same price.  I'm sure the rent at Westgate is high, so the restaurants have to charge accordingly.  In that case, serve food that is equal to the prices you are charging.  As a side note, when I went to the website for Gina's Pizza; it shows what looks like a Margherita pizza on the home page.  The pizza in the picture looks hot and fresh, and yes, it shows a few sliced tomatoes.  The pizza we received looked nothing like the pizza on their website."}
{"text":"Had great food with my girls and their nieces and my mom. Lisa did a great job and I will come back here often."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, servers were really attentive, but the most important thing about the restaurant was missing: good food. I ordered a white pizza and 2 drinks and the pizza was a little less than mediocre. the ricotta was bland, the whole pizza was bland, and the dough used was just unimpressive. It was lacking spices more basil or garlic would have really made it better, me and my friend had to add ample amounts of salt and pepper to it to get it to develop any flavor. and when I'm paying $17 for a single pizza i definitely expect a lot more from the quality. Sorry."}
{"text":"Great experience! In town for business. Came in twice this week. Our waiter was Steven. Very courteous and knowledgeable. Service was excellent. Pizza ingredients are fresh and the wings aren't frozen. Be careful with the garlic knots, they are addicting."}
{"text":"Terrible food and we will never come here again. Their wings resembled something you would see in an anatomy class or body exhibit (See Pic). The few that were normal lacked all taste. Their pizza was undercooked and chewy. Save yourself and avoid this confused restaurant at all costs. The theme is all over the place... Some contemporary mixed with some traditional mixed with a bar that resembles a frat house and lastly add in big screen TVs and sports paintings on the glass storefront. Wow..."}
{"text":"Service was horrible messing up on many orders never starting some of them. Had a bigger party was told we didn't need to make a reservation. Highly don't recommend going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I liked this place for sitting outside and having a drink. Food wasn't all that special but service was good.  There were some annoying and super loud, drunk people at the bar, which am not sure if that is a regular occurrence, but that was my observation for the day."}
{"text":"Overpriced cardboard pizza. Peter Piper Pizza has  better crust. Their garlic knots were good."}
{"text":"Whave been to Mama Ginas quite a bit, but, tonight will be the last time. We ordered a 16' pie, Chicken strips kids meal, 12 wings, and a stromboli. Our $27 pizza was so soggy, it had to be eaten with a fork and knife. My son's $16 stromboli came out 1/2 cooked. The center was cold and the cheese wasn't even melted. Had to send it back and wait another 20 minutes for it to come back burnt. My other son's $9 kids chicken strip meal was ok, but they actually tried to charge us an additional $4 for a kids milk! Then our little girl of a waitress charged us for drinks we didn't order...had to complain about that too. Her attitude was really bad. Made the whole expierience even worse. It is very clear that she is totally inexperienced & should be working anywhere that doesn't involve paying customers. The manager, if there was one, in this \"family owned and operated\" business, was no where to be found. Needless to say, I was really close to walking out without paying, instead we just didn't tip. That was a 1st for me, ever!"}
{"text":"I don't get out to the far West side very often. In fact, it had been so long that I didn't even know all that Westgate stuff was even there. Imagine my surprise! I have been to a few games at the stadium, but all of the shopping and restaurants were new to me. It's absolutely beautiful here.   It was also nearly deserted when I went today - no games going on. There's not much else out here. Just this giant oasis of awesome in the middle of a corn field.   I've glazed over the other reviews here and I almost didn't get it at first. I mean, such polarized opinions about a pizza place. Walking around Westgate and seeing Mama Gina's, I get it now. Mama Gina's is a nice medium sized restaurant/bar. It's really clean and decorated well. The seating is comfortable and everything is new. Also - it smells like pizza - as a pizza place should.  There's a lovely patio with a giant glass door that I imagine can be opened when weather permits to have an indoor/outdoor atmosphere. There are big flatscreens playing whatever sports is on. They appear to have a full bar as well.   I ate a slice and took a pie home. Their pizza is pretty unique. It's very flavorful and good. I could tell that their dough was made fresh daily - it was soft and airy. They clearly use quality ingredients. It's a huge cut above a cheapie chain. While waiting, I saw some other food pass by on the way to their respective tables... everything looked pretty amazing and delicious.   A group was leaving before me and an older man said \"thanks\" to the manager. Then he added that he hadn't had pizza like that since he was a kid and that it was the best pizza he had eaten in years. It was a sincere compliment.  A slice and a soda set me back less than 5 bucks, and the slice was huge enough to fill me up. The pie I took home was as good as the slice I had. This is the kind of pizza you re-heat in the oven rather than the microwave.   Now the problems - well, there's really only one and all other perceived problems stem from it... it's the location. Because it's next to the stadium and little else, it's either going to be super busy or relatively empty. Because of this, service isn't going to be as consistent - you're just going to have to develop a little patience. Also - most customers coming to this sort of place when busy are the \"I'm drunk and happy my team won\" or \"I'm drunk and pissed my team lost\" types - neither of which are a treat to serve when most of the time you're used to things being fairly calm.   I recommend eating here when there's not a game (or even when there is - just be patient - same with all the restaurants in Westgate) - the food is worth a bit of a drive, and Westgate is a beautiful commerce center."}
{"text":"Mama Gina's - well I will never come back here again ! We'll order honey hot wings ! No honey whatsoever ! Sent back to kitchen all they did was put more sauce on wings ! Pizza was grease as can be - it's not New York pizza ! Service was fine ! Food is very poor !"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing, I promise!  It is totally worth getting out of your car, I swear!  Heather is always great at her job, she makes sure you have fluids and roughage!  She even helps you bag up the extra scraps!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch, the salad was plentiful, but it was just \"ok\".   The parmesan cheese tasted like the way feet smell, like it was SPOILED and not \"aged\", which made me a tad leery. Does this place get busy enough to keep the food rotating and not just sitting around smelling like feet?  The service was friendly, the prices were fine, this is just one of those places that was just \"ok\" and nothing really more.  Located directly across the street from the AMC theaters towards the northeast part of Westgate."}
{"text":"Wonderful service.  Pizza and wing special was on point.  Pizza was big enough for a family of 5.  Wings were good.  Definitely be back"}
{"text":"Good for a pre-game meal. Wings are decent (honey hot) , pizza good, philly cheese also good. Nice patio. Service can be hit and miss but usually works out fine before the game. Good alternative to yard house and bww - definitely preferred to Johnny Rockets which takes forever."}
{"text":"Stopped in after checking out all of the choices at Westgate for a quick lunch!  We were greeted by Steven our waiter.  We each ordered a slice and split the Italian sub based on Stevens recommendations.  I had the sausage and pepperoni it was all so delicious!!!   Steven checked in on us often and was very friendly!  Food, service, and atmosphere were all awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding and the food was very delicious. Definitely some of the best Italian food around!"}
{"text":"Horrible, went there on a Wednesday night when there was no one else but myself there and I ordered a personal pizza that was way over priced. They charged me for a 2 topping when I ordered a 1 topping, it took the guy 30 minutes to bring the tiny pizza. I said black olive only and they gave me black olive and pepperoni, when I told them I don't eat meat they took it back and picked off the pepperoni and added extra cheese to hide it but the cheese was not melted and it still had the grease from the pepperoni.. Oh and not to mention it took the guy ANOTHER 30 minutes to do that to my pizza.. When I saw this I asked for my money back and walked out never to return, awful!"}
{"text":"Since moving up here from Tucson 6 weeks ago, we haven't found a lot of great places to eat or hangout but I've been here twice and both times had GREAT service, food and drinks. EVERONE  should try here , you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"It was pretty good pizza. Nothing fancy. We had a coupon from Google Offers. I wouldn't go back unless I had another one."}
{"text":"We were sadly disappointed with our whole meal, though the garlic knots and fries weren't bad. The meal was worse once we got the check. Our waitress was friendly, though service was super slow and seemed to be a bit unorganized. We wouldn't try this spot again, especially with all of the competition in the area."}
{"text":"We came here before the football.  The patio was very spacious and the staff friendly and inviting.  Our food had excellent flavor and the service was very fast.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good service was not they messed up our order twice but made it right by not charging is for it"}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars then I would. Everything here tastes frozen, canned or microwaved. I found a hair in my food and the staff was nothing but rude and unapologetic. Wish there was an actual italian/pizza place in Westgate because this place is nothing but a waste of space."}
{"text":"Outstanding service; Delora was so efficient and accompanying. Great atmosphere/patio and the pizza was outstanding. Highly recommend for date night OR lunch with friends!"}
{"text":"1st: They tweeted a special 2-for-1 sandwich special. Two from our group ordered, and were then told the special was only during a specific time. Fine, except that the tweet came AFTER that time, and it said COME ON IN.  2nd: The AC uniti or something came one EVERY TIME one of the servers, busboy, manager, etc came out through the door...and it stays on if the door is not closed completely...they on many of the occasion left it just slightly open so the LOUD UNIT stayed on. WE had to close the door.  #3: I was charged EXTRA for the EXTRA SMALL DISH of marinara sauce. No mention that there was a cost.   #4: NO SPECIALS, in fact even though there were 2 kids and 6 adults, three of which were separate, there was an automatic gratuity. 17%+.  AND they leave a spot for another gratuity in case you don't catch it. Good thing someone in the group pointed that out.  #5. The garlic knots were ok.  #6. My server seemed to not care about much, sorry I didn't order a BIG meal, but there was seemed little reason to do so.  #7. We meet once a week on Fridays and are looking for 4 specific place to hang on a regular basis..usually there are 8-12 people that come out...I am not sure I am voting for this place...  #8. Why a I doing this??? You ASKED ME TO.. Yelp it you said.. oh wait. this isn't YELP.. ok then.. guess I will now copy and paste...."}
{"text":"Food is no good! You're better off eating Little Caesar's pizza. Their version of the Pizokkie is awful. The cookie was stale and the ice cream was bland."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!! Me and my daughter love this place, Steve was very friendly and professional!  Beer was so good!!  We are coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza, but I've had just 1 good experience here when the weather was gorgeous in the evening on the patio. The first time patio experience was bad because fruit flys (I think) were pretty bad. I had a fine in experience 2 weeks ago. It was cold so we decided to eat inside. The smell inside is like a dirty drain and flys again, but not as bad. The pizza was good, but I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I have been here several times with my family. Love the food and generally the service is good. Tonight I decided to take my family and my sister's family out for pizza. We had a party of 8 and they told us that the wait would be 20-25 minutes to sit outside. We waited over a hr and I kept watching them fill table after open tables. I went and asked the owner what's going on here. He says I don't want to turn away business...but you want to turn away mine. On top of it he told my wife that we had not been there a hr.  Instead he said we have only been here 15 minutes. He called my wife a lier. I told him I would write a nice review on yelp for him describing my experience. He said go right ahead. My wife is devastated that we will no longer be patrons of mamma Gina's. I will not give my money to some that is just that rude. Then again that's why he has a 2 star rating!!!"}
{"text":"I like Westgate. Who knows if it'll last as a Glendale/Arizona destination for outdoor excitement for bored Phoenicians, but I hope it does. Unfortunately, the new Mama Gina's Pizzeria isn't helping.  Is there a better time to test a restaurant than when they're dead at 4:30PM on a Wednesday? They should be both: at their best and thankful they have paying customers to pay their salaries. And at this time, there were three times the number of cooks than customers...so, that means, it was JUST me and my mother in the (INCREDIBLY SMALL) dinning room and six of them. Surely, six employees behind the counter couldn't screw up a simple pizza, right?  What is that old phrase about too many cooks in the kitchen? They spoil the soup? Fine, switch that to pizza (AT A PIZZERIA, no less) and you'll have this generic place.  Don't be fooled by the \"New York Style,\" 'cuz it ain't thin. Don't be fooled by the high prices, 'cuz it ain't chic. They use stock cheese, pepperoni and ham and they burn the bottom crust. So, why did I pay $22 for a 16\" + just two drinks? Because the place looked good when I attended a movie at AMC Westgate?  Looks are deceiving. Trust me: this place is mediocre at best. The service is good, though the waitress sat in the dining room eating a salad while I waited patiently for her to refill my iced tea.  I'm not into gourmet pizza - GIVE ME the GREASE, GRANNY! - so I was a little hesitant entering this restaurant, which, by the way, stated they're CLOSED on one side of their establishment, yet OPEN at another entrance...that should've been an indication of their insecurities. Luckily, the absolutely mediocre food swayed me from eating epicure pizza.  Though it was not the worst I've eaten - I have ordered that $5 Little Caesar's (counterfeit) pizza deal, after all - it was sooo \"okay\" that I simply cannot recommend this place to anyone. Even \"New York\" pizza lovers. Don't go. You can do so much more with $22 and your time."}
{"text":"We were out on the west side and wanted to grab some dinner before the Florida Georgia Line concert. Ended up at Westgate and didn't realize there was a Coyotes game, so it was packed.  After realizing there was a 55 minute wait for our first choice, we settled here as the wait was much shorter.  When we were seated, they did not give us menus so we had to ask for them. Also had to ask for silverware and water.  When the server came to get our drink order we told her that we were ready to order as well. We asked for a couple of specific beers and she wasn't sure if she had them (she had to go check). We ordered the hummus appetizer and a cheesesteak sandwich. All of our food came out at the same time, which was really irritating to me. I told the runner that I hate paying for an appetizer when it comes out at the same time as my food. He said \"oh sorry\". Then I told our server that I was disappointed the appetizer and food came out at the same time and asked if she could talk to the manager. After she came back she said nothing could be done for me because the food comes out of the kitchen when it's ready. Then we asked to speak with the manager, who proceeded to argue with us. Really??? He also was sure to tell us they had been in business for 5 years. Not sure why he needed to tell us that. All I was asking for was the hummus to be comped because it came out late (with my meal). I wouldn't have ordered an appetizer if I knew it would come out at the same time as the meal. He finally took it off the bill.  Bottom line, the experience was horrible because of the lack of basic customer service. The food was ok, nothing special. Wine and beer were pricey and beer was served in plastic cups. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Geez. Not sure where to start.  The pizza was mediocre at best. And overpriced.  Then to sit there and watch/listen to the staff berate some customers in front of everyone.   There are many food options around the Westgate area. This would be the last one I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Went to Mama Gina's with a friend on a Wednesday I believe. Never been to this restaurant before, so decided to give it a try because I love Italian food! We sat outside, it was perfect weather and very nice interior décor as well as outside seating. The issue I had was when we placed the order all the food came at once, meaning we ordered the appetizer and entrée and it all came at once!!! I was eating my salad and then my appetizer and meal came at the same time. I would have never ordered the appetizer if I knew my meal would come at the same time. Here is the worst part, as an Italian restaurant they didn't have alfredo sauce. What Italian restaurant doesn't have alfredo?? It's not hard to make either... The meat balls that I got weren't the best, it disintegrated in my mouth. No flavor at all, tasted like cardboard. The salad I got was a decent sized salad on a tiny little plate, so everything kept falling off and got messy quickly. I ordered a beer and it came in a plastic cup.... P.L.A.S.T.I.C...... :O C'mon! I get that I was sitting outside, but that seems like a cheap move. Overall the people were friendly here, but I won't be back because of the sauce."}
{"text":"I'm glad I didn't read all of these negative reviews before we went here on Friday night.  Our family of four wanted some pizza, and there's not a lot to choose from on the West side of town.  My husband suggested Mama Gina's and since I'd been wanting to try it for a while, we decided to go.  I'm glad that we did.  We ordered two appetizers, mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini.  Both arrived quickly and were hot and delicious.  We also ordered a 16 inch half cheese, half pepperoni for my husband and daughter to share and a small Supreme for my mom and I to share.  The waitress was very attentive and refilled drinks quickly.  She also took the dirty plates from our appetizers away while we were waiting for our pizza.  Many servers fail to do that.  When our pizzas came out, I noticed that our Supreme had mushrooms on it, which we had asked them to leave off.  They quickly offered to remake the pizza, but we declined as we did not want to wait for it.  We just picked the mushrooms off and it was fine.  The waitress apologized profusely and told us she would take a portion of it off of our check.  We all enjoyed the pizza and the atmosphere.  The service was really great, too.  We will definitely go back, and I hope all of the negative reviews don't stop people from giving it a try."}
{"text":"Consider that a negative star  Stopped by to get a slice of pizza and a drink. We had our little Yorkie poo dog with us. So we decided to sit in the patio. Keep in mind he is hypoallergenic and does not shed.  Unfortunately, the Manager said he was not allowed in the patio area. We were 15 feet away from any other patrons.   Never going back here again, ever!!! Good thing Bar Louie is dog friendly in the patio area. Plus they have great margaritas and appetizers.  Tough loss for Mama Mia.  Manager must be a cat person."}
{"text":"On October 24 2015, my wife and I went to Mama Ginas for the third time. This time we had mild wing's and a meat lover's pizza. As usual, the food and service was top notch."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with a group of 5 friends during bike night. First the positives: The pizza was actually pretty good. We also had wings that were decent. Another in our group ordered a philly cheesesteak sandwich that looked yummy. Our service was good. We were actually enjoying our evening and food then came the bad: the check  My husband and I ordered the special which was $22 and change plus he had a soda to drink. Our bill was $35. Why you ask? Because the tip 18% was automatically added to the bill. I asked the manager why the tip was automatically added thinking it may be because we asked for the check to be split. She informed me that they automatically add the tip to groups of 6 or more. Our server then said \"Oh, I thought it was 5 or more\". Well her loss because I would have tipped more than their automatic tip but I hate being forced to tip especially without any advanced warning (like something printed on the menu). \  Bottom line-there are other choices in this area and we will definitely be going to those before I come back here. If you visit with 6 or more people either go somewhere else or don't sit together!"}
{"text":"MY NEW PLACE TO WATCH UFC FIGHTS! I've always liked this place but I was informed by my fantastic waitresses (Heather and Rebecca) that now they have fights on UFC Saturday's my group of friends will be going here for sure to watch the fights and enjoy their great food!"}
{"text":"The place does look nice but if you don't have good food what's the point of having the restaurant. I am not saying the food was terrible it was just ok. Patio has a good view of Westgate. Friendly staff was definitely a plus to the experience."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! Management does not support their staff, We ordered an appetizer, four drinks and four dinners. It took over 20 minutes to get the waitress to come to our table. We waited another 20 minutes to have her drop off two of the drinks we ordered, the appetizer showed up about 20 minutes after that and then the waitress asks, did we not bring you the other two drinks? 10 minutes later two dinners show up and two people begin eating and finished their plates.  The waitress shows up to ask how it's going and we ask for the other two plates of food. She is completely surprised and told us the meals had to come to our table. We told her two times that they did not make it to our table. We asked that she please take the meals off of our bill. My wife asked who the main manager was and she approached the main manager sitting at a table, who seemed annoyed that she was letting him know her experience. He asked her what do you want me to do, sorry your food didn't show up? Sorry, My wife asked him why are you asking me what you want me to do? What are you going to do? He said he would take 10 percent off of the bill. She said don't bother, and she asked if he would come to our table to speak to everyone and he flat out said No! Wow great customer service!  Another person came by our table and stated we took 20% off the bill. We were not looking for a discount, we were just simply wanting to let them know that they failed at giving us a great experience at their restaurant, that was it.  Here's one: how about you get your lazy rear up off your seat and make our experience better than telling us sorry you didn't get to eat the dinner you ordered? Not one time did anyone offer to go make us our meals. They were more concerned telling us that they knew the food came out of the kitchen. My guess is they don't need customers like me that get upset when a group of four people go out to eat and only two dinners show up at the table. We won't be going back! What kind of manager is ok with four people ordering food and only two of the meals make it to the table?"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Went with 7 people night of Trans Siberian Orch show.   1. Waited 10 min for drinks which did not come at once 2 Friend ordered Pinot grigio. After above 10 minutes was told by waitress it was not chilled (excuse me it's an Italian Restaurant) and that owner says it's too much trouble to put in the shaker to cool  3 after getting drinks we ordered.  However,  pizza and salad order was not put in  for two people.  They got no food at all.  After we had all finished waitress says she  put order in for them.  20 minutes too late. 4 Overheard they ran out of salad .  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"We went here as a group of 10-12 people for West Valley Friday Night meetup. Was greeted nicely and they had table setup for us ahead of time. We ordered the appetizer sample and cheese garlic bread to start. The Garlic Bread was good and cheese melted nicely without being burnt. The various items in the sampler were all good tasting. my wife and I ordered a supreme pizza for her and I and it was tasty. the crust was a little under cooked and flimsy/soggy. The supreme also came with black olives (which I don't like but just picked them off), which were not listed on the menu. We let the waiter know and he mentioned the menus were being updated already due to other issues and he'd let the manger know about that error. They took 10% off of our bill, without prompting, for the mistake.  Overall was pleased with the place and service. Will probably go back there sometime."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now. I ordered the two slice with a drink special mainly because a whole pizza was at least $25. The two slices come and I immediately think this could be microwave pizza that you would get from a vending machine at your local ER waiting room. I digress, I taste it and it all changed!  It wasn't vending machine pizza at all, but expired Totinos from the local Frys!   Honestly, don't even bother with this place. I rarely write reviews but this one couldn't be passed up. Save your money."}
{"text":"Lousy pizza, way over priced, even the drink didn't taste right. Not a good choice. The pizza had no flavor, it was just not very good. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The hidden gem of of Westgate! Sammie, Heather and the crew come through with food and service 2nd to none. Do yourself a favor and stop by pre game, post game or date night. Solid choice every time!"}
{"text":"Worse place ever serves sucked and no matter what if there is a party of six they still charge tip even if the serves suck the manager is a ass my wife went in there to talk to him about it he got to really close to her face she thought he was going kiss her very uncomfortable to her I went in there to him to never do that again he kicks me out and says f u to me had to go get security and I had to pay for the sorry ass manager the money this company is a joke stay away far away or he might try to sexually harras one of your family members"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was flavorless food. I don't mean this to be mean or over sell it. The food had no flavor. Best thing was fries. We had a cheese steak and chicken parm sandwich. My wife got 4 bites in and put it down. Just sad as we needed to get to a game - no time to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here with my daughters for pizza, of course all they wanted was cheese but it was a delicious!  I love that there was not a ton of sauce and the crust was crispy on the bottom.  We will definitely be coming back to try more.  I saw and smelled the garlic knots and they looked/smelled so good.  The service was awesome, our servers name is heather and she was friendly and made sure to check on us a couple of times."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I were at Westgate for *cough* the britney *cough* spears concert.  Yea yea, you can question my taste if you want to because of that fact but I think we all secretly love her! Plus I got tickets on Groupon for half price (I claimed that was the only reason I went)  I digress. We were trying to find a place to eat and everywhere had a huge wait time.  We ended up wandering and finding Mama Gina's, we walked in and were seated immediately (good timing a huge crowd came right after) The server was very helpful in making suggestions.  Not wanting anything too heavy my friend and I decided to split the appetizer platter based on the server's rec, we each also had side salads and blue moons (on tap with an orange slice just the way I like it)  The bruschetta was to die for.  Some of the best bruschetta I've had. Fresh beautifully ripe juicy cherry tomatoes.  Cheese sticks tasted fresh, not dumped from a frozen box into a vat of oil, and the zucchini was delicious.  I wasn't a fan of the fried mushrooms, I have definitely had better.   I think this is a great addition to Westgate.  Their pricing is reasonable and the food and drink is good.  Nothing special about the ambiance, it is a small cafe type setting. We'll see how long the prices stay where they are but for now I give it a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Slow service...pizza was soggy .....I used a restaurant.com gift certificate and didn't encounter any problems.  For dessert we had the fresh baked chocolate chip cookie which was divine.  The waiter always apologized for the wait but after the first time I didn't think it was genuine because there was hardly anyone in the restaurant.  Overall, I'd probably recommend coming here if your not too picky on food and you don't mind getting slow service."}
{"text":"I found their pizza to be pretty bad. It was ice cold and flavorless. Why was it cold? It did not sit that long from what we saw since we were sitting at the bar right next to the serving window. We dived in right away Hmmmmmmmmm.   The man behind the bar was pretty cool and nice though. The hostess was not friendly and ignored us at first. The place gets busy at Westgate so maybe it was an off night.   Why the heck is a pizza 20 bucks? Chris Bianco does not even charge that much."}
{"text":"This pizza here is way overpriced and even worse is that the flavor is just average.  The pizza has okay sauce but is just average in terms of toppings.  However, it's so expensive relative to what you normally pay any place else so it's really just because of the location that you have to pay more for this pizza - not worth it."}
{"text":"Loved the wings! Our server, Heather, made our first visit the BEST! Thanks for a great experience!!! :-)"}
