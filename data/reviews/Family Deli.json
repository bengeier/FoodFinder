{"text":"Very bad service.  What is wrong with these people?  I go here for the third time, the first two with poor service also, but it is local and I want to be fair, and the people there are surly and unhelpful.  I will not be back.  There are other local businesses where my money is welcome."}
{"text":"Family Deli just catered a family birthday party for 60 people.  The food was excellent, the price extremely reasonable, the service and delivery perfect. I recommend this catering business to any and all in the South Hills.  Hopefully they will deliver to a wider area also."}
{"text":"Great little throwback deli with local breads and condiments. Ordered three fresh sandwiches and some deli slices to go. Food was amazing and the services was great. Will go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE the family deli, but ever since it has been under new management it has gone waaaay down hill. The people are rude and not accommodating! I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"I was visiting Bethel Park to see my brother, when he took me to this local deli for lunch. I had great customer service, the super friendly lady took time to describe the weekly sandwich specials and also let me know I could build my own. They have lots of ready to go items as well. I ended up with a delicious ham and Swiss on a baguette. It was huge! In fact, I made two lunches out of it. I also picked up pierogies, stuffed cabbage and a large bountiful chef salad for dinner. Food was fresh and delicious! By the way, I was only in town for 3 days and ate there twice!"}
{"text":"Family Deli is Bethel Park's hidden gem.  The food is fantastic! I order from there at least once a week, and I don't think I've ever had anything that I didn't love.  Kim has done a wonderful job appealing to every foodie, from meat lovers, to vegetarians, she's even offering some vegan options! They get super busy at lunch (obviously), so if you're in a hurry, call early.  They also have a wonderful selection of grab and go options, if you can't wait for the weekly specials.  I've had family from out of town asking to go back & countless friends who have used Family Deli catering.  I really can't say enough about how delicious their food is."}
{"text":"Like some of the previous reviews indicate, the food here is awesome, but the customer service is absolutely horrendous.  I went to the deli for one of their weekly sandwich specials, and as usual they were busy.  After waiting in line for 15 minutes it was my turn to order, when I told the person behind the counter what I wanted, a second deli worker (who was rather large in stature) with his back to the counter since he was slicing meat started loudly saying \"You've got to be kidding me!\" over and over again!  I couldn't believe it.  I understand they were busy, but I was a paying customer, and as far as I could see there were no signs indicating sandwich orders weren't available when they are busy.  Openly complaining about doing your job in front of me and a line of other customers is absolutely ridiculous and if I was the manager, I would be embarrassed.  I have used them for catering numerous times in the past, and they will no longer receive my business."}
{"text":"Family Deli is a great local shop!  Great food, service, and value!  While Market District may have a wider variety of meats to choose from, the quality at Family Deli has always been better.  It is quick and convenient and all the the prepared foods are super fresh.  They have their own \"in-house\" meats and also a lot of higher-end Boars Head meats.  You can't go wrong at Family Deli."}
{"text":"Growing up nearby, this was our favorite place to go for candy.  For the past few months, I've been working at my parent's house and have been a frequent customer. I've had their coffee, pastries, tons of sandwiches and salads. Everything has been fresh, delicious and very well priced. Thrilled they have Brunton's milk as well. Best of all, it's great to support a local, long established business that provides excellent service."}
{"text":"I've been following them on Facebook and see their tantalizing specials every week, so I finally stopped in to pick up lunch for me and a friend. First of all, the portions are huge. They do not skimp on fresh, top quality ingredients. I ordered one of their cold sandwich specials and it was packed with Boar's Head ham, cheese, veg, and a delicious peppery spread. Half of the sandwich was plenty as the meat was piled a good two inches on the roll. For $9 you get a huge sandwich, a pickle spear, and a side of Mac salad, potato salad, or coleslaw. It fed me for two lunches!   My friend's salad was huge. So big that it actually didn't fit in their take out container so it had to be wrapped in cling wrap because the lid couldn't close.   There were lots of ready made things in their to go fridge, including pierogis, soups, hummus, and desserts, an assortment of breads and baked goods, and you can order cheese and deli meats.   I highly recommend calling ahead if you are in a time crunch. I appreciate that it's all freshly made, but you will have  a 5-15 minute wait depending on your order if you order at the counter.  Service was super friendly!  Parking lot surrounds the business so it's definitely convenient.   Follow them on Facebook so you can keep up with their weekly specials!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this local gem.  For years my sister has purchased fresh rolls for various family functions - always wonderful.    Yesterday, upon the recommendation of my other sister, I purchased a pre-made italian hoagie.  The onion, tomato and lettuce was packaged separately - very nice touch. T he sandwich was delicious, quality meats and cheese.  The person who checked me out was friendly, efficient and personable.  It was very nice to not feel like an outsider.  Really nice place - check it out!"}
{"text":"Awsome food and sandwiches... Great boars head lunch meat. Daily specials are fire great prices. Always stop here for linch when im in the area........."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely fantastic...I just wish I could say the same for the customer service.  I knew it might be a long shot because I was calling only a few days beforehand, but I called to try and place a small, pickup catering order for a party.  I called and asked if it would be too late to place a small order.  The guy who answered scoffed loudly and said, \"No there is no way....well - what do you want, lady?\" I answered a pick-up order of chicken and a pasta salad.  He scoffed again and replied: \"No.  Absolutely not.  We're totally booked for weeks.\"    I was totally taken aback.  I mean, I know I missed the boat on time here, but there was no reason to be so rude.  Luckily Giant Eagle was much nicer..."}
