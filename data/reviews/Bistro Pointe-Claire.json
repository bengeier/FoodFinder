{"text":"Short drive from the airport to the picturesque village of Pointe Claire ... Great spot for a nice brunch. Friendly servers, nice old homestead and excellent hollandaise for the eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"The menu needs to be expanded. No pasta dishes. I found for 26$ the bistro platter was expensive. They should acknowledge it is for only two.
Service was good though."}
{"text":"I went with my wife for brunch on a Sunday morning. Excellent and helpful staff, the food was prepared perfectly and was very tasty.
We had each ordered an omelette with vegetable soup entrée.
The only reason why I gave 3 stars is because of the very limited brunch options.
They have a very vegetarian/vegan friendly menu and look forward to returning. Most likely will end up upgrading to 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is fine dining with a classy rustic-chic experience.

The dishes were true delicacies. Not only in the chef's creative and skillful incorporation of subtleties and blends in both flavor and texture, but as well in the creation of presentations which both matches and augments the classy decor, architecture, and ambiance of the establishment. The building itself is a beautiful piece of historical architecture located in the beautiful Pointe-Claire. 

If you want to try a menu where you'll find an experience of comfort, surprise, and intrigue with every bite, I recommend Bistro Pointe-Claire.

My compliments to the chef."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience for our first time visit. Although the food was very good and the terrace is really a nice setting for a summer night, the lack of service was very frustating. Our server was a lady who obviously had very little experience and was quickly overwhelmed when the terrace got crowded. We got our drinks before our glasses of water, we had to ask for some bread because it was not served before we got our appetizers. We were not told about the specials of the day. My plate was quickly served on the table without any attention on how it was put in front of me and I was never told that it was hot. I was served the rack of lamb without a steak knife, all I had was a butter knife. I had to use the steak knife from my son's plate because it comes with the burger. We had to ask for the servers to pick up our empty plates long after we were done because the flies were bugging us. No one came to ask if we wanted dessert or coffee. My husband went out of his way to wave at the manager and order some donuts. We then had to ask for the bill. Very disapointed because our meals were quite good but the service ruined it all. We will not return."}
{"text":"Atmosphere :
We went on a Friday evening, and the atmosphere was wonderful! The cozy lighting, pleasant music and nice decor all helped the place feel very intimate despite it being a full house.
The staff was incredibly polite, patient and helpful!

Meal :
One of the meals we had ordered was the homemade sausages, which were incredible. They were the most flavourful, delicious sausages ever. We were later told by the chef that the meat will vary depending on the game meat available to them (wapiti, wild boar, etc.). Ours were wapiti sausages. Yum! 
We also had a soup, and fish and chips; our orders were very beautifully presented and were very, very enjoyable. 

Dessert :
The chocolate bourbon cake was warm, rich, and basically melted in the most satisfying way. 
The goat cheesecake maintained a subtle flavour without being overwhelming in the least, pairing fluffiness and creaminess perfectly. 
Both are a must, especially if you enjoy going out for dessert.
Finally,  don't hesitate to ask about their nice selection of wines! Each of us found something to our liking there. 

We will definitely go again, and introduce others to this beautiful gem!"}
{"text":"Intimate casual
Good quality food & attentive service.
I liked all the details. 

Starter fish cakes very nice with touch of jalapeño in the mix served with a dippy chipotle aoili scored well - tasty & not super spicy 
Fresh bread presented on a small slate with unsalted butter & salt chucks to sprinkle.
For Mains
Veal cheeks first rate - not a huge portion but Taste!!!
Mushroom ravioli delicate and delish
some may say undersalted- but taste again subtle and fresh.
Our friend had mussels& fries with  blue cheese sauce - loved them.(Her 3rd time)
Nice Croatian pinot grigio to swish things down - just right
Will have a croatian donut next time."}
{"text":"Ate here last week with friends. Generally speaking the food was good. Appetizers were good  - -  we shared a lakeshore platter - excellent calamari and fish cakes, shrimps were good.

For mains, one of us had the fish and chips, it was very good, not great but very good. One had a flank steak (or flat iron steak), fries were really tasty and the steak was good, cooked perfectly, a little chewy but very tasty, one had the lamb chops (or small lamb roast, not sure what they cal it ) - apparently this was excellent. And one had the fishermans pot, mixed seafood in a bowl, also good, looked a tad skimpy on the seafood though.

All in all the ambiance was nice, the beer was excellent (Beaus lager), however they were out of 2 kinds of beer, and the service was friendly. The waiter did screw up one of the mains though so the fishermans bowl came about 10 minutes after the other meals, not  big deal and he was very apologetic.

We ended off with and order of the little donuts, very tasty.

All in all it was a good experience, a bit pricier than it should have been, from what I am used to in other similar places for similar fare, but i think I would go back and try some of the other menu items. I regret not having the Mussels as they were on special.

This place could be amazing since the atmosphere is really good and location great, feels a bit like they are still learning and the staff is a bit green, but very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"We stopped here during a road trip through Quebec just yesterday. We arrived at 11:30. There were only lunch items offered, no brunch. The vegetarian burger was quite good but my husband's fish and chips were drowned in oil and undercooked/doughy. The hostess was very blasé. We waited inside for her (the place was desolate) for about 5 minutes. When she finally arrived she seemed like we were bothering her. We asked to sit on the porch and she gave us a stupid look and said, \"Then just go outside and sit wherever,\" in a really IDGAF tone. 

They were very understaffed. Once we were ready for the check it took us 10 minutes to flag someone down and another 10 minutes to get 3 boxes and the check. 

For real? Find somewhere else. 
Also, you'd think you'd get a water view being so close to the docks, but no luck."}
{"text":"I looked the place up the night before because it's actually really hard to find a restaurant with a vegan option around here.
I wasn't disappointed !!!  the vegan burger was really nice and not dry!!!
They don't have a kids menu but the fish cakes with some fries made them definitely happy!
The goat milk cheese cake is worth the try but pass on the Croatian donuts 
The staff was nice and helpful.
So why 4 stars and not 5??!!
The price... guys, the food is nice, the location is nice too, but a bit overrated..."}
{"text":"Yummy! Food was good, patio was pleasant. Love the heritage home that the bistro is located in.  

We will be back to check out this bistro in the future"}
