{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Pho,rice dishes and everything is very good and def gives you a happy tummy. I always come to this as it isnt too far away from where I live. I love how they started adding boba,Snoh and macarons to their menu they're also very tasty. They sell macarons only on Saturdays for 1.50 some time 2.00... They're a bit tiny but they are always a guilty pleasure.. the Snoh and boba are top notch as always not bad on the prices neither. The environment is very friendly and welcoming. Im obsessed with their brisket pho and crispy eggrolls. This place isn't too hard to find and is a good place to come and grab a bite to eat. The waiters are very friendly and always have a smile on their face."}
{"text":"Food was great but the credit card machine was down.  Best to bring cash in case. They have a good selection to satisfy any popular vietnamese dish you may be craving."}
{"text":"http://www.sfgate.com/restaurants/article/Taiwanese-dessert-snow-ice-hits-the-Bay-Area-3425457.php#photo-2723544  Snow has come to the valley of the sun!! Food was great, nice also to see a family run business doing so well.  Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I found Pho Avina while driving by it almost every day. I didn't know that there was a Vietnamese cuisine there. I always go to Da Vang or Thao's Sandwiches.   I really like their food and service. They are very nice. Their spring rolls and Bi Coun are good. Delicious! I like their Pho but not as much as the other places. I really like their rice selection. They have tons of choices. What I like about their rice selection is that it comes with the BBQ pork. Shredded Pork Skin, Fried Egg (rare in Phoenix, I think), and crab cake (I think that is what it is called). Other places will only have the meat, shredded pork skin  and rarely the crab cake.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is willing to try food that is not American!"}
{"text":"The food overall was about a 3-star.   This review is for the boba. I order boba smoothie here several times already, hoping that they will get better, giving them the benefit of the doubt. Well, this would be the last chance I would give them for boba.  The smoothie taste diluted,  or in order words, flavor water with ice sloshing around in it. The tapioca balls are soggy, and bland, not firm, chewy nor flavorful.   I would just come back here for the food, but never again would I be foolish enough to give their boba another chance."}
{"text":"The food is good, however they will often close the boba bar due to being short staff. When asked why, they just said \"it is too busy today\""}
{"text":"The price is a little high for me.  They don't give enough bean sprouts without asking for more.  The pho broth is a little too sweet for me also"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The staff is very friendly and attentive and I like the casual atmosphere. The special beef pho is the best in town - very fresh and flavorful broth. Angelina's, Pholicious, and Pho Viet are good but not as good as this place. You get a huge portion, with lots of meat and noodles. Just add some of their chili paste and the plate of add ins and you're good to go! They also have delicious pork egg rolls for an appetizer and boba for dessert!"}
{"text":"We dined there when they first opened and weren't thrilled - mediocre at best. But we did decide to give the place another chance this weekend past, and we're glad we did. A very nice pho, and milady wife enjoyed her noodle dish very much. Service was a bit distracted - they were quite busy, and it was hard to get a refill on my Coke - but not so much that it ever rose to the level of annoyance. I don't think that the place rises to the utter delish-ness of the old Avina's, but it's still pretty good :-) . We'll be back."}
{"text":"Moving from San Diego with one of the best pho places... This place and many other here in Arizona is a complete joke. It's always neither too salty or too sweet. Pho is not suppose to be sweet.   I also tried the rice plate another time and they were super cheap on the meat and veggies!  We were so excited we found a new pho place to try and it was packed with people so we assumed  WE FOUND OUR NEW SPOT ... Boy was I disappointed. We ordered appetizer and it didn't come out til after we got our BILL! So we told the guy we no longer want it and they still made us take the spring rolls. I've never been to a place with such slow service. I'll never be coming back. Sorry avina u disappointed my Vietnamese family."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed in their broth for their pho. You would think with some of their high prices, it would be high quality. Pho Tai tasted like straight up water. Their Bun Bo Hue was good though."}
{"text":"The best spring rolls! Their food tasters fresher and more delicious than ever. I had the deluxe vermicelli salad and I tasted a hint of lemongrass in it today and I loved it. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the fried sweet potato was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle which I love."}
{"text":"Pho is on point! Service was nice and the restaurant is clean! I got to a few places to get my pho fix and this is one of my favorites!! I always get the dinner bowl!"}
{"text":"The food used to be fresh and tasty but ever since the new owners have taken over I've noticed the quality has gone down. The pho lacks flavor and the grilled pork no longer taste fresh as it used to.   There are other places in the area that seem to care about the quality they are serving. This place is no longer one of them."}
{"text":"Really great strawberry boba drink. My roommate suggested we go here for bobas after our horrible dinner at the sushie place near it. Glad she suggested it. Takes the gross tasting sweet shrimp out of our mouths. Will come back."}
{"text":"Simply the best. I'm pretty much in love with this tiny, hole in the wall Vietnamese stop.  In a small strip mall near ASU West, not many other Vietnamese places can compare in my opinion. For those of you who love Cyclo, I'm convinced it's b/c of Cyclo's cute interior vibe. It shocks me they consistently win so many Valley awards. Pho Avina is 100 times better, 50% cheaper, and has about 10 more offerings of pho than Cyclo....among many other things.  Ok enough of comparing...I would highly recommend one of their Banh mi (traditional Vietnamese sandwich). They have the specialty bread delivered daily from a local bakery, so these disappear FAST! The yummy pate is truly what makes this delish. Being from WA, these sandwiches usually aren't hard to find, but I've noticed in AZ it's a lot trickier to locate em.  The best pho ever, consisting of a large portion. Pho Avina also has great appetizers...I haven't had too many of the entrees b/c usually when I go, I'm craving pho. Lastly, they have a good selection of Boba (tapioca) flavors (I personally prefer mango) and desserts....oh and don't forget the Thai Iced Tea...a must here!  Friendly friendly service, everytime we go we are greeted by the owner, who couldn't get any cuter....Please try!   http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/articles/0613phoavina.html"}
{"text":"Went to this pho/boba restaurant last Friday night. Ordered the spring rolls and a #41 (Pho with egg noodles, crab meat, calamari, pork and fish). Spring rolls were brought out right away and were very delicious with a very yummy peanut sauce. Pho was brought out right after and I thought it the broth was very flavorful and vegetables were fresh. Lots of the seafood and pork as well.   They also have a \"Boba Bar\" inside which i can't wait to try.  I was very pleased, thought this one was of the cleanest Pho restaurants I have been to. Boyfriend who is Asian prefers his fave at 17th Ave and Camelback, I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost 8 years off and on. The past 2 or 3 times I've gone the service was so god awful, it was painful. Last time before this we were basically forgotten towards the end of our meal and sat for over 20 minutes and realized our waiter disappeared and we could hardly get anyone else's attention. Finally gave card to pay and waited another 20 minutes for our card back so we could get the hell out of there. Tonight my husband was craving pho so we gave it another chance. Big mistake. Tables around us who got there after us got their food, paid and left way before us. Again we were left sitting there being ignored. It was just awful. They also got our food wrong but decided to overlook that though we were annoyed. It felt like the waiter had no idea what they were doing and the constant waiting makes us never want to come again. Very disappointing since I've recommended this place to a lot of people over the years. Might come by for boba but that's about it"}
{"text":"This place is PHO-real the best! Love everything about it except no beer but who cares with food and service  this incredible!? Highly recommend the build your own pho brisket and eye round steak and also the Chinese sausage spring rolls!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place probably once every other week for lunch with coworkers.  Unassuming and usually quite full during lunch, this place is great for cheap, filling, and delicious eats.  I would highly recommend the Oxtail Pho Soup, it is personally my favorite.  My only complaint is that the service is sometimes spotty and if you need to use the restroom, there may be a wait as to access it, you need to walk through the kitchen, where health code requires that the ladies stop their food preparation before you walk through."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a neighbor today. Loved the Pho. Had the vegetarian spring roll so many soup (pho) selections! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Had to write this review. I had been to Pho Avina quite few times and thought it was good not great in comparison to a few other places in the area.   The convenience in location brought us back, even though it seemed like their portions were getting smaller and smaller.  Today we ordered a takeout and I found a a cut fingernail in my noodle soup.  I can't tell if its a finger or a toenail, but it still makes me sick thinking that I ate some of it.  Its too bad because the mom here seems like such a nice sweet person, but somewhere along the line, whether its the cook or someone by the takeout boxes, someone is cutting their nails where they shouldn't.  I obviously will no longer go there and suggest no one go there either."}
{"text":"So let me start with.. I had never had Pho until I went here on Thursday. With that being said, I have nothing to compare Pho Avina to. But .. reviewing service and food. Service- good. Fast. Helpful. Food - we had spicy beef soup, chicken and shrimp soup and coffee boba. All was really good.  Edit: now that I'm pho-ducated and have tried over 30 pho places around the country, Pho Avinas brisket pho is by far the best. 1/23/17"}
{"text":"This is my first time ever trying Vietnamese food. I was really surprised of the portions and how fast the food came out. My friends made a few suggestions. I went with #5 (pork & shrimp spring rolls). The spring rolls came with peanut sauce that was so good! My main entree was #50 (grilled meat & egg roll). Basically a noodle salad with vegetables meat with an egg roll. It came with a sauce that I poured all over. Mixed it up and it was AWESOME! I am definately coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here again, and I almost upgraded to five stars.  This place is very reliable.  The Pho was great and this time they gave us all the goods to put inside, cilantro, sprouts, mint, etc...  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Bomb bomb bomb pho. Got oxtail and shrimp, was perfect. Definitely the new spot when I'm feeling noodles"}
{"text":"I always just get one thing from Vietnamese places and its their rice dish with grilled pork chop and egg cake. This place does it goooood. You get a reasonable amount for the price and the fish sauce is just right."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!! Great place on the north side of town. Pho is good, subs are yummy, and rice dishes are to die for. The atmosphere is great, nice and comfortable and very clean. Staff is always wonderful, friendly and attentive.   THE BEST PART.... SHAVED SNOW!!!!!  The shaved show is excellent! So much flavor and yummy goodness.  To be honest, its way better than Snoh on Camelback.  Give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"overpriced pho & food portion was like a kids menu......sad"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today, the spring rolls are great with the peanut sauce and Mai Ploy sauce. I also had the the chicken fried rice which has to be the best rice I've had in a long time. They get 1 star off for the chicken in the fried rice and the fact that they are closed on Sunday's. I think they could cook it a little longer as it was a bit chewy, but still on the all time best fried rice list!!! The entree I split with a friend was # 53. Rice noodles with beef and fried egg roll, pour in the fish sauce and enjoy what could be some of the best I've had since being in Vietnam while in the service. Last I had a boba Thai tea to go. Also the best Thai tea I've had in Az hands down. You will see me checking in here quite often and trying other things as I am sure the entire menu is going to be tasty! Great drive by discovery!"}
{"text":"I drive from central downtown Phoenix to come here often. Best Pho in town. I would recommend Eye Round Steak on the side rare to cook in your soup as you eat. Boba is sometimes hit or miss"}
{"text":"Food was great the first couple of times we went. Boba drinks n vermicelli are bomb! But I started noticing that the beef pork chicken and shrimp had pretty  much the same taste maybe is cause they grill them together or same seasoning. Also I notice the food is pretty greasy. You can tell because there's  a buttery taste that stays in your mouth even after drinking water. The ox tail pho was the soup with the most fat n grease. I still like this place but I think that maybe I'll  order something else next few times."}
{"text":"Having moved to Arizona recently, I went looking for some pho for a little bit of comfort food. This place was the first pho restaurant I saw when I searched online, and I'm glad I went! The broth was flavorful so I didn't use any hoisin sauce- just a little chili sauce. The noodles weren't stuck together. The service was nice and quick. I will be going here again for sure!"}
{"text":"I found this looking just at reviews and it is worth the high marks. I stopped for takeout since pizza sounded boring. We got the fried special catfish, chicken curry, egg noodle and spring rolls and it was all delicious. Very nice owners and very authentic Pho. Don't let the strip mall fool you this is a gem."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price. Always fresh, always tasty. Great place to meet up with friends. Try the spicy beef wraps. Delicious."}
{"text":"We found this great Vietnamese restaurant on our way to north away from the Phoenix heat for the weekend. We love their food selections and also the way they prepare the food.  We had their eggrolls, shrimp appetizer, pho, Avina rice platter, and also one of the fried rice dish.  At the end we also order one of the desert shaved ice for all to enjoy.  Great place, great food, and great prices."}
{"text":"The pho here is really good.  Better than most places.  The staff is nice and pretty attentive.  The Ox Tail Pho is awesome!!  When I need more sprouts or green onions, they bring it with no problem."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Avina's since it was located on Bell rd.  The owners are friendly and always remember you.  I love the Bun (Rice Vermicelli with salad and fish sauce), the sweet potato cake and the spring rolls."}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant on Monday and were absolutely delighted with the food.  The spring roll appitizer was fresh, tasty and delicious.  The pho was very good and with the addition of more spices, was also delicious.  The flavor of the pho was right on the mark with rich taste and just the right amount of meat, fresh herbs and noodles.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes authentic Vietnamiese food."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and I was pretty excited to know that they have Shaved Snow and Boba, but just found out that shaved snow is only available on Summer, and didn't get to try their Boba drinks neither, because part of the restaurant was out of electricity due to stolen electric wires, so they are not able to make cold drinks and desserts for few more days.  We were there around 5pm Monday, only a couple of tables occupied. We ordered #24 Eye Round Steak & Shrimp Pho, and #31 Beef Meatball & Shrimp Pho, $7.99 each, both taste OK, not the best but not bad at all.  There are 4 shrimps in each Pho, shrimps tasted FRESH, that's so important!  I ordered more noodles to my Pho for $2 extra and that was really a lot of noodles, satisfied with the quantity.   The price for each item is a dollar or two higher than the two Pho places where we used to go, but acceptable because this place seems clean and neat, friendly customer service, and the quantity of food is ok. Will be back to try other items and desserts for sure!"}
{"text":"The veggie pho was PACKED with veggies and tofu. I couldn't fit my noodles in it lol the tofu is some of the best tofu I've ever eaten anywhere. Perfect texture and seemed very fresh. The veggies were also very well cooked. The only thing is, the broth wasn't very flavorful. I got the chicken broth with my veggie pho. Even adding the basil and cilantro into the broth (and jalepenos because I like a little kick) still didn't give it much life. It was also $10 just for the pho, which was a little more that what I would have liked to pay. Maybe I was spoiled at my other Pho place I regularly visit which was only $7.95 and had amazing broth."}
{"text":"Honeydew boba is so yummy. I've had better pho.  Servers are nice"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place very often. The food was awesome. Probably the best pho on Phoenix. I don't know if they have a new owner but the pho broth tastes like water. I came a month ago and the broth tasted like water. Came for lunch a week later and it was good. Now tonight ordered the pho and it tastes like water. Probably won't come back because of the inconsistency of the pho which is the only thing I eat here."}
{"text":"I have been here a few different times but I have finally learned my lesson. My recent visits have been very disappointing and left me feeling full of regret rather than satisfied. At some point I ordered the Pho Ga and the chicken tasted gamey like it had been cooked a few days prior and reheated. The taro blended drinks are gritty and overpriced. This past week I ordered a build your own pho with shrimp and tofu. The shrimp had discolored, dark tails, and some vein leftover from improper cleaning. The herbs and vegetables had some green mushy leaves mixed in for good measure. After all that, the cashier gave me the wrong change but it wasn't worth it to go claim a buck and some coins. I hope they step up their game and the quality improves in the near future."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 7 people. tried the pho and it was really SWEEEET, to much sugar & skimpy on the thin steak. I've been eating Pho for years & I've never left a place feeling so darn thirsty....MSG anyone!  Spring rolls...Welted lettuce & really oily noodles plus the peanut sauce was NASTY!! So waterd down..EWWW.. But the straw that broke the camels back was when they charged us $2 for chilli oil. We spent over $70 & bought bobas, which those were awesome in the place...WHO CHARGES FOR CHILLI OIL!!!?? With all that said, there are much, MUCH better pho restaurants in the valley....But then again, this is just my opinion."}
{"text":"We've been going to Avina's on and off for over 12 years. This has always been one of my favorite places to get chicken curry and spring rolls.  Unfortunately, I need to echo what others have recently written. The service and flavors were nothing like what they used to be.   Spring rolls had been prepared a long while before and were very dry and unappetizing. Chicken curry had a few bits of chicken, weak curry flavor and lots of soup with little substance. The eggrolls were all crunch with nearly nothing inside.    I would have given it 1-star, but I intend to go back and try again in a few months. I like the people who run the shop and hope they turn this around. If not, then my next trip would be my last."}
{"text":"Good pho, egg rolls n service! Tried the fresh limeade soda and shaved snow for the first time and loved it!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Perfect for a big soup on a cold day or a refreshing boba in the middle of summer.  My favorite is #19 - Bun Rieu - a vermicelli soup with tomato, egg, pork and crab meat.  Requires a little adventure!"}
{"text":"I drove over half an hour so I could eat here, so of course it's delicious. Probably the best Pho in town, and definitely the best variety I've seen. The Ox Tail soup is fantastic, and I've never had a bad experience. The staff is very friendly, and they think it's awesome if you're daring enough to order more traditional menu items like the special beef soup or the durian boba (which is really tasty, despite its stinkyness). The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because of how far it is for me to get there, so I only go maybe twice a year. If I could, I would go there all the time."}
{"text":"I love Asian food, and this is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the west valley. I don't usually get pho however since I don't eat meat. I love the curry dish, vietnamese subs (lunch only), and have enjoyed everything else I've ordered from the menu. The boba is delicious as well. A lovely mom & pop place--which is atypical for the west valley, but I'm thankful that we have it here conveniently located across from ASU West!"}
{"text":"Love their chicken pho and vermicelli salads! They also have amazing boba! On most days, the boba balls are tremendously soft which I loveeee! My sister and I come here often and have gotten to the point where the staff remembers us :)  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"on one plane, there's really no need to update a 5 star review with a 5 star review but then again, when you got it, flaunt it. While I won't review it each time I come here, I skipped reviewing the last 2 or 3 visits. I love this place...it loves me back.  Owner not there today, service spot on and food, well I keep trying something new each time and each time a touchdown. Every table in the place occupied. Every time I have been there, it's been SRO. I don't think that this place is a secret.  Besides the egg rolls (hard to skip this and I just don't love sweet potatoes), today I went for the BÚN RÊU, blue crab meat, eggs, tomato and vermicelli noodles in a chicken broth...and of course a mango boba.  All of my previous forays into Vietnamese have been rice noodles and reading other reviews about pho induced coma's seemed silly to me. Well, this wasn't a pho but 30 minutes later I just wanted to curl up and go to bed - I think the vermicelli had something to do with that.  I love the fact that I could meet Scott W there, the same service, similar food (he had the beef/shrimp pho) and he gives it 3 stars and I give it 5. Different strokes for different folks I guess. I should have told him that he could get wooden disposable chopsticks instead of the nice round plastic chopsticks and perhaps he would have given it 4 stars..."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Avina's for over 30 years.  Back when the original restaurant was at 43rd Ave and Bell Road.  It was the BEST Vietnamese food in the valley.  When Avina sold it to the new owners they changed a lot of the recipe's and it just is not the same anymore.  They are always busy so I am sure they will stay in business but they are so disorganized and the service is horrible.  We keep going there hoping for the old Avina's and keep getting disappointed.  We were just there this weekend and our egg rolls were so cold we had to send them back.  Then we watched people that came in after us, order, eat and leave before our food came.  When our food finally came, it was cold!  Then they kept looking at the checks stacked up at the register and you could tell they were not sure which check belong to which table.  We had to go up to the register to pay, they never brought the check.  They never refill drinks, they leave the dirty dishes on your table until you leave, they don't ask if your food is good or if you would like anything else and as another review noted they don't ask about dessert which they could increase their sales if they did since they have Boba and Snow which is good.  I am so disappointed in the new owners.   They must not have owned a restaurant before and they need some serious help!  We have been trying other Vietnamese restaurants and have not found a new favorite yet.  If I had a choice for my last supper it would be Vietnamese food so I can't express enough the disappointment I have with the way this restaurant has changed.  Avina - Please open another restaurant, we miss you!  Sorry, I wish my review could be better."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken and Shrimp Pho, the shrimp fried rice, and pork egg rolls.   The phone order was a little bit difficult because they have the old menu up still and the lady was confused because I was trying to order the numbers from the old menu (I only had access to the menu on Yelp so hopefully it can be updated to the most recent menu. Although it took us a while, when I got there to pick it up everything was correct.  The shrimp fried rice was the best I've ever had! It had great flavor and there was enough for several meals. The pho was good although I wish there were more jalapeños in the sides and I wish there were onions as well. Next time I will be sure to ask for both. The egg rolls were just okay, but everything else was delicious.   It's a cute place and I will definitely be going back to try out their dessert bar and teas. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Everyone else seems to love this place but me. I had a very strange experience there. First off, the food was average but that wasn't my main problem. It wasn't even that the service was bad just....weird.  I eat at plenty of ethnic places so I'm used to people not understanding English but the gentleman would come to our table, pretend to take our order, leave and then the woman would come back and take it again. This happened over and over- \"Can I get a refill on my soda?\" man nods, woman comes back and asks what we wanted. It wasn't just us. There was a large family eating there and they were really having problems. The biggest issue for me was when I ordered something (crispy pork skin something or other) the woman looked at my date and said \"That is pork skin, she won't like it. She should order something else\" Uh, hello? I'm sitting right here! I think I can figure out that crispy pork skin means just that, crispy pork skin! Then I ordered some spring roll thing (Sorry, its been a couple of months now and I don't remember exactly what everything was) and again, she looks at my date and says \"She'll have to roll those herself. She should order something else\" WTF? Did I just become invisible or what? Trust me, lady, I have rolled plenty of my own, spring rolls and otherwise! It was one of the most bizarre experiences I have ever had in a restaurant in the states. I've been in other countries where I was systematically ignored in favor of speaking to the man I was with but not in my own neighborhood! So, personally, I'll stick w/Little Saigon in a cute little house in Old Town Glendale where I'm dotted on by the flamboyant waiter and the food is better."}
{"text":"Every culture has their comfort soup.  American's have chicken noodle, Mexican's have menudo and Vietnamese have pho.  I must have been Vietnamese in a past life.   Pho is the national dish of Vietnam and a staple at any Vietnamese restaurant and Pho Avina has some of the best pho around.  Let me warn you - this isn't an appetizer, this is a meal.  A big, steaming bowl of soup served with your choice of meat and noodles in a savory, almost sweet, broth.  The pho is served with a large plate of fresh basil, cilantro and bean sprouts; the cilantro complimented the soup nicely.  I chose the chicken and shrimp and was pleasantly surprised with large shrimp and big chunks of all white chicken.   My eyes were bigger than my stomach, so I also ordered the deluxe vermicelli salad.  A salad of noodles, veggies, beef, chicken, shrimp, eggroll, sweet potato cake and fish sauce - toss together and enjoy.  I had it boxed up, but did nibble on a few items and the sweet potato cake is out of this world good.   I had come for the banh mi at the recommendation of a previous yelper.  They only serve the sandwiches Monday-Friday from 11-3; I had just missed them.  Darn.  I will definitely be back to try the banh mi and a boba, there were soooo many delicious flavors to choose from except for the fresh durian - icky, icky, icky."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite place for over a year now. My boyfriend and I have never had any issues with the food or the customer service. The food is always tasty and the service is impeccable; I always feel like coming back here because I love the way they make the customers feel. The Boba smoothies are delicious as well but my favorite food is of course the Round eyed steak pho"}
{"text":"Good restaurant,kind ppl, come here a lot and the p10 is really good chilled sauce is needed"}
{"text":"Such a family friendly place, great prices & excellent service. Have been coming here for over a year now & have never been disappointed. Also their shirts are adorable!!!! :)"}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer to Pho Avina,it's close to work/Home. My experience today was the worst. I have never had issues with the staff or my order. But today I had a younger crowd of females waitresses all glued to their phones when it came to ordering. I had to wave them down just to get their attention. I ordered my meal the waitress didn't bother to write the order down so I assumed she knew what she was doing. As soon as my order came out it was incorrect and again I had to wave the girls down to fix the order. I am sad to say I will not be returning to Pho Avina because of the rudeness of the younger waitresses. Customers come first! Not our phones"}
{"text":"Love, love the coconut shaved ice!  I would have given it a 5 star but they just take sooo long to prepare the shaved ice dessert.  Food is great too!  Food comes out a lot faster than desserts....weird....but am still a fan! =)"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Pho place in Arizona.  It has been difficult finding a great pho place ever since we moved out here and even though this is a bit of a drive for us, we happily make the trip out to Pho Avina!  The fried and non-fried rolls are absolutely delicious- a great start to the meal.  The pho broth has a deep and clean flavor!  The sprouts and side items for the pho are also very clean.  They take the time to cut off the stringy part of the sprouts, which I think shows attention to detail.  We always finish our meal off with snow!  Every flavor that we've tried has been amazing, but our favorite is the taro flavor with condensed milk and strawberries:)  The family who runs this place are also all very nice people!  The staff is great too.  We didn't realize that they stopped serving snow after a certain time, but they were kind enough to make it for us!  Good people and good food-- win win!"}
{"text":"The best vietnamese in the area.. Especially g ood f or the AS U west community.. In Glendale Az. The dishes are more traditional not in that \"Fusion\" style of preparation that caters. Their Phone is great do is their (Bun) vermicelli noodles dish"}
{"text":"I have finally found great PHO in Phoenix. Great prices ($6.5 for \"lunch\" aka small), solid broth, and really great service! We went in as a group of five and the servers immediately offered to split our checks! This place also has a boba/dessert stand inside too. I didn't get a chance to try the desserts but the boba was pretty good. DEFINITELY coming back."}
{"text":"Good but not worth a revisit.  Pho 43 still reigns supreme in my heart and is worth the extra mileage. Back to this place... pros they have boba tea. The Thai tea is good but the milk tea was off (hopefully) otherwise it is extra bitter on a regular basis. They also have shaved snow which I did not try but the table next to us looked like they were enjoying it. I would stop by for a Thai tea if I am in the area but not the pho or sesame chicken."}
{"text":"I used to come here as a hungry college student going to ASU across the street.  Happened to be in the neighborhood and stopped in.  They recently remodeled and changed the menu a bit.  The place is still as amazing as ever.  I only get one thing here, #59.  The beef is amazing and peanut crusting along with fried egg is incredible.  Friendly service and incredible Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Mike L 1/1/11 review is spot on.  Broth is clear, but pho was a bit meager at especially $7.99 bowl prices (or even std cheaper Phoenix pricing).  I don't think a bathroom really exists for customers, so wee or pee boys and girls before you come."}
{"text":"Walked in at 9:14 (they close at 9:30 on Fridays) and they told us they couldn't serve us. Told them flee were just here for Boba to go. The waiter followed us to the counter and asked what we wanted so they could tell us they conveniently \"just ran out\" of the flavor we wanted to order. Terrible and rude service. I will not be back. They cost themselves a $8 snow drink that probably costs $0.50 to make."}
{"text":"It's one of the better pork vermicelli that I have had trying many places.  The waitress was sweet but not as attentive after I received my meal.  She was the only waitress working though and held it down.  Over all I would come back."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Pho, but finding a great one in town has been tricky. I happened upon this place the other day while taking my son out to lunch. WOW! Was I surprised! Absolutely delicious and great prices to boot! My son now is a fan after his first bite :)  Quick service, clean place and lots to choose from..We will certainly be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I had the pho thai and it was good the broth tastes really delish I also had their snow which was SO good! some of the best I've ever had.  If you've never had pho before, you should really try it  ($5-$9) If you've never had snow before, you should really seriously try it (you can get it to go too) ($4-$8)  I really like this place, and am craving it RIGHT NOW."}
{"text":"I had udon noodle soup.  The noodles were perfect, broth rich and flavorful.  The meat, however was of a higher quality and more of it then other Vietnamese Restaurants.   Very little trip and tendon, and the beef was very recognizable.   It was homemade the first time I had this dish, therefor what I have to compare it to.   The meat balls were excellent.   I will be returning again trying other dishes."}
{"text":"***This review is for their Boba Tea only*** Regretfully I never got to try the Pho but when it comes to Boba in the West Valley this place takes the cake and is far superior to much of the nearby alternatives. The boba are good consistency, the flavors are all good (love the taro) and the price is very fair."}
{"text":"Recently came here for my birthday with family. It was the first time we ever went and the staff was super friendly and food was great. I had the #59 \"PHO AVINA SPECIAL RICE PLATTER $12.99\" and it was delicious. Large portions, but just the right amount if you're really hungry. I also ate the shrimp spring rolls as an appetizer, good as well! TVs inside were on and playing the World Cup for guests"}
{"text":"Great Pho!! Had the beef base with Chicken - delicious!"}
{"text":"Dissapointed that the pork chop dish tastes nothing like it did a month ago. The new owner mentioned that the old owner didnt leave the recipes and that is why the food tastes different. We used to travel 30 minutes to eat here,  sad to say our patronage of this place is over."}
{"text":"I've been a customer, for many years, since it was called Pho Pat.  Pat is Avina's father.  Avina and her mother took over and did great things, but it's gone a bit downhill since they sold out.  Today, I got 7 orders of spring rolls to go with extra peanut sauce.  The rolls had less flavor and meat than in the past.  The sauce used to be great.  We dug in to find that it was watered down and just not good.  I called them to let them know that there was an issue, and was told that was the \"new recipe.\"  I expressed my displeasure and hope they go back to the old recipe.  There is no sense to cut corners at the expense of losing loyal customers.  It saddens me to give a less than 5 star review, with my years of history.  I originally was going to give them a 2, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they'll fix it, and restore the quality and guest experience provided by the past owners."}
{"text":"Came in to get a Baba I got taro and  Coconut it was quite delicious didn't really taste much the coconut but perfect  of sweet and just the right amount of ice and sugar Baba was cooked perfectly nothing sticking together no hard pieces good job on that  Definitely one of the better Baba's I've had in a while"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Pho places in town (maybe 8), and this place is at the top tier for sure, if not the best I have had.  Nice looking place, always busy (for good reasons), and the service is still very fast.  I have not tried the non-Pho menu items, and may never.  Soup cures the soul!"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm Vietnamese and born in Vietnam.  If any body knows pho, I know pho.  I've eaten at hundreds of places all across the country, from Orange County, CA to New York, NY including where pho itself was born...in Vietnam.  I've had numerous people tell me to go try this place out so finally I did.  I ordered the pho with just the beef(tai) and meatballs(bo vien), an order of spring rolls(goi cuon) and a boba shake.  The pho was delicious, very tasty and amazingly sweet without having any MSG added to the mix.  Thumbs up for me, the service was great and superfast and friendly.  This is where I shall eat pho this side of the valley from now on.  Only few places beat the dining experience here if you want Pho.  As for any of the other dishes they serve, I cannot comment because I have not yet tried them but will soon."}
{"text":"I had lunch here last week and it was very good. I started with spring rolls and had a bun. Service was good and the food was great. I will be back again when I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"Best pho in Phoenix hands down. Friendly staff that remembers us and never disappoints in offering suggestions"}
{"text":"Great customer service, especially serving my group of 14. Very accommodating. Food came quick and was very good. Can't stop thinking about that snow ice. It's so light and fluffy and delicious. Too bad I don't live in this area. Can't find it anywhere else."}
{"text":"Whatever you guys are doing lately, things are back on track. We love the chicken pho and the deluxe salad. I also highly recommend the spring rolls. The peanut sauce they make is fantastic. We go here once a week. The sno is fantastic too."}
{"text":"This place has the best pho ive had anywhere! I highly recommend the brisket! They have amazing snoh and boba too! We always visit when we are in the west valley. Love it!"}
{"text":"I went here once with a friend. I had never had Vietnamese Cuisine before so I was a bit nervous to tell the truth.  I ordered what my friend ordered because I wasn't sure on what to get. I was so glad I went.(sorry I don't remember the name)  The food was delicious! And I liked trying the food with the different sauces on the table. I haven't been back but I want to.   Worth a try. Very delicious and there were many veggies so it has to be healthy too right? ;)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I've only ordered from here twice, so I'm not sure if they've changed anything since then.  what I know is that the ginger catfish is superdelectable, and with the rice soaked in the sauce from the fish...mmm...so great! and the owner was quite friendly, as well."}
{"text":"I'm giving Pho Avina 5 stars mainly because they make what is probably one of my favorite dishes on my side of town. Their tofu curry is so good! Better than any Japanese, Thai, Hawaiian, Indian, etc. curry and I'm the biggest curry lover in the world. Now I am usually the only one in the whole restaurant who orders anything but pho, but that is because most people haven't discovered it yet. If you come to Pho Avina and have a craving for anything besides pho, do yourself a favor and get the chicken curry. It is amazing!!"}
{"text":"My new cold remedy - Chicken Pho.  I walked in on a Saturday at about 11:30am. The small dining area was packed with a diverse crowd.  I ordered Thai Iced Tea, Spring Rolls and Chicken Pho. The spring rolls were fresh and tasty, but I was not feeling well and looking forward to the Pho.  Within 10 minutes, a large steaming bowl of Chicken Pho was placed in front of me. While there were plenty of noodles, there wasn't much meat. Still, it was delicious and it hit the spot. After a few dashes of Chili Sauce, I was also feeling much better.  The food was good and cheap, the staff was friendly and I have since visited again with my husband."}
{"text":"Came for the vegetable eggrolls, love them! The Pho broth was amazing till the last drop. Clean, friendly, good food"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I've been here.  You know the place is good when you haven't gone in a couple of years and they've expanded!!  This place is just as good now as it was before.  We enjoyed the shredded beef with rice and the noodle dish (that is soup-less).  Boba was nice and fresh.  I hate it when the pearls are not fresh!  Definitely check this place out!  Really great food!"}
{"text":"For all the amazing reviews, this place isn't that great. I've ordered pho a few times here and the beef broth is oddly sweet every time. it tastes so weird...and the beef is really chewy. I ordered fried rice once too and that wasn't great either. honestly, if you're looking for tasty authentic Vietnamese food, don't come here."}
{"text":"Good but not the best pho. Their boba, however, is the best i've had in glendale. Good service and cleaner than most vietnamese restaurants i've been to."}
{"text":"Figured I'd come in and give it another shot. It's been quite a few years since I've been in here.  I tried it a long time ago and I didn't like it much.  Busy as all get-out for the lunch hour crowd which seemd to be a little bit too much to handle for only one server. She was working her tail off! The beef broth was weak.  Not very beefy and lots of clove and anise.  The pho GA is so so.   Asked for Thai tea without boba and got boba.  But like I said...she was runnin' her tail off.  One good thing i guess is the lunch size bowl is pretty big.  So there's that.  Not my cup of tea but I'm sure others will like it."}
{"text":"I've been back a couple of times since my first review, and the results were much more positive.   I found that if you order pho to go, you can ask them to package the meat separately, as long as you swear to cook it right away. I did so, and the pho was much tastier when prepared fresh.  Another time, determined to branch out from pho, I ordered the special catfish. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of bottom feeders. They get that muddy flavor to them.   But not this catfish! It tasted clean and fresh, and it had a light, crispy breading on it. The whole dish was fantastic.   I also still adore their melon boba tea. I tried the taro one time, and it was OK. But melon is where it's at. My only criticism is that the boba pearls have a slightly gritty texture."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's close to my office and I come about once per week. The soup bowls are massive and delicious, and I bring coworkers that probably never would have considered Vietnamese food, and now also share my love of it. I also used to dislike boba, but now I look forward to getting one when I come for my weekly bowl of noodles. My only complaint is the $10 minimum for credit/debit cards. However, by the time I get lunch and a boba, my bill is right around $10. I hate that I am forced to get a drink, but it's nitpicking, I could just as easily carry cash."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try as the reviews have all been very good.  This is a very out of the way place for us, but we travel for great food!  We tried the vegetarian spring roll, good.  The tofu appetizer, just a fried nondescript waste.  My husband had the vegetarian Pho.  Visually excellent, lots of vegetables, tofu and noodles.  Downside, the veggie broth was very bland.  We've had vegan pho before with great broth, and this one lacked umph...I tried the vegetable curry with tofu.  Just ok.  Too many potatoes and not enough vegetables.  All in all, the place was ok, but not worth the long drive to get there.  There are places closer to where we live that are better."}
{"text":"My vietnamese roommate took me here and introduced me to this place.  Amazing.  Awesome pho noodles and.  Also the best egg rolls I have ever had.  The place is hidden and sketchy looking in an old strip mall but man what a find.  They are closed at odd and early times however, which is frustrating when you are craving it.  Totally worth it."}
{"text":"I love their pho ga! Great broth. Their coconut curry is tasty too! Self seating. No booths...which is a bummer. They have this dessert called \"snow\" that is so strange and fun to eat. Plus they have smoothies and boba."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! You get seated right away and you can place your order right away as well. Your food will come out quickly and consistently taste the same, yummy!  The service is where it's lacking, if they just left a pitcher of water at every table they'd bed set. They do not come often and if they do its because you waived them down. Personally, I think it has to do with the culture and not bothering/harassing people while eating.   Clean restaurant and bathrooms another plus!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and am always pleased. This last time, I took a friend to introduce him to Pho and he loved it! I will definitely be going back to this place again. The food is good and the wait staff is very pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying I just moved to the area and I have pretty high expectations as the one near my home in Colorado was the best I've ever had. With that said, I do really enjoy this place.   Pros:   They have jasmine tea and it comes in a pot you can pour yourself with the cutest tea cup!   Comfortable atmosphere. I often come here solo to do some reading or just for a quick lunch in between classes since it's right across the street from ASU west.   Their broth is really tasty. Doesn't have too much anise which I like.   This place is cheap!! Large portion of pho and tea for 10 bucks can't beat it.   Cons:  Their meat isn't the best. The first time I got the brisket and it was really cut too thick and it was fatty. I wouldn't recommend it.   AND the meat to noodle ratio is a little off sometimes. But I prefer more meat to noodle and normally order extra meat but it costs 3 whole dollars extra for meat.   If you are starving and want the larger size bowl, it's also three dollars more.   Overall, a decent and convenient place and one I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Very clean, nice atmosphere, usually quiet. I've been here once for boba and was not disappointed! The service did seem a bit sparse, hence my rating of 4 stars. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"yes.. there is PHO in PHOenix.. (err actually glendale but my play on words wouldn't work here)  i was using yelp as my handy guide to eating my way back to LA.  after seeing mcdonalds and wendys every block of the drive anywhere i decided i needed to see what AZ's opinion was on vietnamese food..   i just happend to be there a couple days after Don V.'s post.. he laid out his credentials on his pho knowledge and then described it to be \"The pho was delicious, very tasty and amazingly sweet without having any MSG added to the mix.\" i was sold the nite before.. and i couldn't wait for lunch to come sooner..   so glendale is huge.. and i had only seen the chain fast food restaurants everywhere and then we head over towards peoria and well.. damn.. it's a whole different scene.. it looks like it hasn't had a makeover like the rest of the town.. and just had a real feeling in that area.  i have to say.. it really didn't knock my socks off but i've had worse pho in LA.. it's flavorful but lacking in someways.. and it was very greasy..  i don't like grease in my pho..   but i wanted to also try their spring rolls and egg rolls.. it's nice they serve in smaller quantities because sometimes you don't want 5..   2 spring rolls - $3 2 egg rolls - $2  the egg rolls took awhile to come out but the spring rolls came out in a flash.. i didn't think too much about it and stuffed my face.. and then i looked at it again.. and there was a twinkle in my eye.. so rather than using regular pork in their spring rolls they use their grilled/bbq pork. so you get a kick in the ass flavor explosion..   then i knew i had to order the bun cha with grilled pork for the friend because.. it was the best grilled pork i've had anywhere.. and i don't even like grilled pork.  they have a different sauce for the bun cha than for the egg rolls..it's got chili paste in it for a stronger kick..   i was tempted to order more spring rolls but didn't and got a thai iced tea.. they don't use as much sugar as the other thai iced teas i like.. and it wasn't as creamy as if they just used a teaspoon of milk in the glass.. it was still quite dark too..   i'm not one to complain especially if i don't know the expectations of the neighborhood.. but i'm pleased with the help i got from yelp to save me from getting #1 combo from McDs..  which means more to me than anything.."}
{"text":"3 stars for the boba. The large is a small cup halfway filled with ice and costing $5 a pop. Not the best boba I've tasted. But the pho looks good. Will come back to try that and those tasting looking shaved ice desserts."}
{"text":"Although I live in Michigan these days, I still spend about 20% of my time in Phoenix.  Every time I visit, I make sure I go to Pho Avina at least once or twice.  This is seriously one of my favorite restaurants anywhere, I can't say a single negative thing about it.  The food never fails to amaze me - every meal I've had here has been nothing short of fantastic.  The portions are also very generous, and the food is incredibly inexpensive considering how good it is.  One other thing I have to point out is how awesome the staff is here.  Everyone has always been so friendly and has taken time to answer any questions I might have.  I absolutely love their Vietnamese coffee (I get it black, without condensed milk), and I've never been able to figure out how they make it so flavorful and amazing.  On my last visit to Pho Avina, I asked one of the servers if he could tell me how they make their coffee, realizing that they might not want to disclose their secrets.  He showed me how to use a Vietnamese coffee maker (different from other kinds of coffee makers), wrote down the brand name of the coffee they use (Trung Nguyen), and told me where in Phoenix I could buy both the maker and the coffee.  I was blown away by how forthcoming he was with information and how helpful he was, as many places probably wouldn't do this.  One thing I can say is to make absolutely sure that you eat at the restaurant.  Take out will not be the same, as pho needs to be made and eaten immediately - even a 10 minute wait can have a really drastic impact on its flavor."}
{"text":"I tried the newly opened boba corner and it's pretty good for West Valley standards. I was about to give up on finding a place to get my boba fix until I found this and the boba at Lee Lee's. The boba balls itself weren't as good as Lee Lee's. I got a mixture of good chewy boba, really soft boba and kinda hard undercooked boba. But they have plenty of flavors to choose from to keep me coming back. The Taro and mango (separately) are good and pretty cheap. Drinks range from only  $2.99 to $3.99 for regular size. But bring cash or lots of friends! They only accept credit card for purchases of $10 or more."}
{"text":"The more I eat here , the more annoyed I get. Usually the service is bad. The order is wrong or someone gets their food long before who ever you are eating with., had that happen twice. Ordered Pho and watched other people walk in after me and get their food 10 minutes quicker.   Or you get someone else's bill. I have placed to go orders and gotten into a borderline argument over extra peanut sauce. I had that happen 3 times. I didn't ask their opinion of how much I should have. I want more and will gladly pay for it.  The spring rolls taste very good but fall apart consistently.  The Pho isn't bad, but I can go many other places and not be annoyed. They do have good desserts that you won't get in most places ."}
{"text":"Finally found a place that has a good avocado boba!! Had it at a few places and they always make it super sweet and usually doesn't taste like avocado but i was impressed! Perfect combination! I watched them make it and use a fresh avocado which I know most places don't do so that was awesome! The restaurant looked nice and the bathroom was nice. Boba was 4.99, other flavors were cheaper but since they used a fresh avocado I thought it was worth it."}
{"text":"Beef short ribs are good. Comes w/ a mini salad, rice & miso soup. I only give 2 stars bc the amount of meat changes every time I go. I wanna try one of their sandwiches next but I never go in the afternoons."}
{"text":"great pho , boba :) and vermicelli .. awesome !"}
{"text":"I am a Vietnamese so I like Vietnamese food. I have visited some Vietnamese restaurants around Glendale, AZ so I can make a comparison among them. IMO this is the best one in term of Pho and Bun Bo Hue (I only ate these two in Pho Avina)."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Vietnamese restaurants, but this place has got it down. I had the beef Pho bowl and my girlfriend had the Crabmeat stew, both were fantastic. The only complaint I have is $3.50 for a smaller sized Thai Iced Tea served in a boba style cup. Otherwise, great location, great food, great prices. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wanted Pho on a cold rainy evening because I knew something warm and flavorful would soothe my soul. That's exactly what it did.  I ordered a small iced Thai tea, shrimp spring rolls, and chicken and shrimp pho in a lunch sized portion. The Thai tea was really sweet. It didn't have much flavor and was just overpowered with sweetness. The shrimp springs rolls were very refreshing and fresh. The peanut sauce that came with it was also too sweet. Now for the pho, I believe the pho was perfectly balanced. It was not overpowering in the spice Star anise. I could taste it but it wasn't super strong like other places have been.   The customer service was amazing. We were never left hanging at any moment. There were multiple people going around asking if you needed anything and making sure it happened.   Besides the overly sweet Thai tea and peanut sauce, I liked Pho Avina and I would totally return!"}
{"text":"Yeah, so, I've eaten a lot of Pho since I had my first bowl ever here. Hands down Pho Avina is definitely my go to place.   Forgive me! I'm sorry I ever doubted you!"}
{"text":"3.5 * The lady who cuts my hair is from Vietnam and she recommended this place when I mentioned my love for pho.  She said she really doesn't eat it very often since it's fattening (mind you I think she probably weighs about 80 lbs. so I think she needs more pho!!). I was feeling a bit under the weather so a big ol' steamin' pho bowl was right up my alley.  I arrived a few minutes before they opened and people were already outside waiting-a good sign I thought.  Upon entering I was surprised as this is probably the cleanest Vietnamese place I've ever been to-another plus! So, I order pho tai and pork egg rolls.  The service was quick, and as more patrons entered the restaurant the staff welcomed everyone as if they were long time friends. My food arrives and everything is good, the pho broth is a little bit sweet than I personally would care for but has a good complex flavor.  Ditto the egg rolls, you can tell they're homemade when they're imperfect.  I thought their prices were a bit high but I certainly left with a full stomach. Though Pho Thanh is still my favorite, I would return to Pho Avina again another bonus it's not too far from the house."}
{"text":"I'm in town on business and picked this place based on Yelp reviews and close location. It definitely didn't disappoint. I ordered pho ga for takeout. The young man who took my phone order and helped me on pickup was extremely pleasant. The food was delicious and being a tree hugger I really liked that the veggies and noodles didn't come in a Styrofoam container like I normally get. Veggies and noodles were bagged separately and then put in the bag with the soup and chicken. Less waste."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Just yum!! Service fantastic! Chili tofu is delicious and spicy. Veggie noodle soup...  Yum! Can't wait to go back and try more!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Pho and fresh spring rolls.Both were ok,nothing better.The rolls were room temperature and the pho was not piping hot.There is better Pho in the valley for sure.The service however was very good."}
{"text":"Ok so Its time to light Pho Avina's facking ass on fire.  I remember going here when just the old lady ran the joint.  She was top notch, the food was good, she cranked out one hell of an avocado boba.  Those were the days party people, those were the days.  Now let me compound things a bit.  I am talking tons of shit to my co workers about how I love vietnamese food and that you just cant get a good nuoc mia ninh kieu in Phoenix (obviously trying to be a food badass, cuz I am) and Pho Avina goes and sucker kicks my shit in the ballz.  For the record I ordered easy.  I went ZERO pho as it was 142 outside.  I went BBQ Pork bahn mi, spring rolls, bobas.  I GOT SOME MOTHERFACKINGSHITTASTICAMERICANIZEDBOOLSHEEET.  I say again, BOOOOOOOLSHEEEEEEET.  Bahn Mi  Rotten brown HALLOPEENOHS, check. Funky ass pork, chiggitty check y'all. MotherFACKINGCHUNKS of veggies, microphone check y'all.    How do you fuck up a bahn mi?  Spring Rolls  rotten lettuce, uhhh huhhhh crispy rice wrapper, you bet your ass  Boba  Got FACKING syrup?  Let me tell you this vietnamese food experience went over like a turd in a punch bowl with my co workers.  Who now have undisputed proof that I am a dip shit and to not listen to me.  Based on this one Pho Avina experience.  My co workers have shunned me.  Pho Avina just got put on notice.  I used to eat there because I thought it was a cool little AUTHENTIC vietnamese joint.  I dont go in for mass consumption shit."}
{"text":"New: I went here with my my brother in law from Tucson last night. He loves pho and this was the only one close by open until 9pm. We ordered pho dac biet dinner portion and a pho gau lunch portion. The dinner portion was like the biggest bowl of pho ever served. My husband and BIL couldn't even finish their bowls....and they usually order pho xe Lua all the time. The soup was good. I am changing my star to a 3 because our dine in experience was better than our to-go order. The expensive price is worth the amount of food served. But only 3 stars because my friend ordered a strawberry banana Boba and it tasted powdery and like pepto bismo, $6 bucks. What a waste, she left more than half on the table when we left. Sad.    Old: I ordered some food to-go a few weeks ago and was super disappointed. I've eaten here many times in the past and really enjoyed their food but maybe since the new owners, they are not into quality assurance as the old owners. All I ordered was two sandwiches thit nguoi combination and a regular dac biet pho. 1) the sandwiches were horrible! I used to think these were the best Vietnamese sandwiches in town, even better than Lee's Sandwiches. The meat, the pate, and mayonnaise really made the sandwich stand out. I was very excited to have the sandwich again but after a few bites it didn't taste good so it definitely didn't taste like it used to. I opened it up and there was a smudge of pate on one side as big as a thumb print and on the other side there was a smudge of mayonnaise as big as a thumb print also. And there was very little meat, none of it overlapped. My husband and I used to fight over who got the last bite of the sandwiches but this time we both said you can have it I don't want it anymore. 2) The pho was nothing great. I thought the regular bowl is way over priced! $9? I asked them if that was the XL bowl when I was ordering and she said no the XL bowl is $11. Pho Avina is overpriced by $3 per a bowl. So basically their Pho better be the best...and it definitely wasn't so...I'm a NO GO!!"}
{"text":"OH MY VIETNAMESE GOD. You have clearly touched down in Glendale...  I've been here twice now, and wow. Its just, amazing. I am a huge fan of Vietnamese cuisine, and have tried some pretty phenomenal places throughout my travels, but hands down, Avina is a gem, although I don't think its that big of a secret considering the amount of patrons that constantly occupy the place.   The perfect combo...  1.) BÌ CUN - shredded pork spring rolls 2.) PH TÔM C BT - Beef & Shrimp  + Sriracha & Hoison hot sauces to top everything off because I love my Pho SPICY!!! 3.) Coffee Boba (amazing amazing flavor)  They also provide you with the necessary sprouts, mint leaves & lime, of course..  I think I'm in love."}
{"text":"My daughter first told me that Pho Avina was one of her Vietnamese friend's favorite places to get Pho.  I would have gotten a bowl except it was mid-day. So, we settled on fried vegetable eggs rolls and a mango boba tea. They were both fantastic. This is the first place in Phoenix that served a whole large leaf of lettuce for me to wrap my egg roll and dipping sauce. This is the way I was taught to eat Vietnamese egg rolls. The rice paper skin was crisp. The filling was flavorful. I did not miss the meat.  Our bubble tea was also very good. The pearls were perfectly prepared with enough chew and still soft. The blended drink had enough sweet and had good flavor. They had a plastic covering just like we enjoy them in Singapore.  Next time, I will definitely have the Pho!"}
{"text":"Very good and very clean. The pho was very flavorful and had tons of meat in it. Lots of nice fresh veggies to accompany it."}
{"text":"Been there more than a handful of times and nothing stands out.  The pho/entrees/boba drinks are all just 'Eh.' Pass this up and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Food was so delicious. Honestly the BEST beef and broccoli I have ever had. 1st time trying Pho and it too was so delicious but can't compare as it was my first time eating it. Will deffently be back as this is my new favorite place to go.  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came in for Boba and was pleasantly surprised they had a Pho menu. Chicken Pho and Taro Boba, savory and sweet, the perfect combination on a cold, winter evening. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of Pho in the Valley and I have to say hands Dow this is THE BEST PHO you can find anywhere! Service is good, prices are good. It is family owned and operated and they are wonderful to their customers. My favorite is the Ox Tail Pho, but all of them are great!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!   Great Vietnamese restaurant.   Started with my favorite crispy shrimp and spring roll.  Delicious!    Had the #38 shrimp, crab meat and steak soup. My new favorite!  Washed it down with a mango boba.  The whole meal was really good.  The service was adequate and its a great place to people watch.  One of my favorites in Phoenix."}
{"text":"There are times - such as at the end of a tough work week - when nothing can be more soothing than a bowl of flavorful pho, steaming hot with an incomparable fragrance after the addition of the herbs offered on the side. And on such occasions one of my favorite places is Pho Avina. They offer a good variety of  soup and noodle dishes as well as a variety of sandwiches (banh mi). Their rice dishes are also great; my favorite is their Pho Avina rice plate with grilled beef, pork, and shrimp. While the range of offerings may not be as extensive as Pho Thanh's, it is definitely more than adequate. Fast service, tasty food, good prices - all in this relatively modest restaurant in a  quiet strip mall across the street from ASU West."}
{"text":"Just got home w my pho w chicken-HOLY COW- that's some good stuff!! Perfect amount of \"you add 'em\" ingredients, and the chicken breast was boxed up separate also-and it was a LOT! Perfect perfect perfect! This great big bowl will last me at least another 2 meals. And the spring rolls are yummy and crispy and fresh - glad I found this place, I WILL be back for more! Thanks Adam for helping me out & showing me the \"snow\", promise to try but only when I'm eating there. BTW: very clean- and pretty crowded....was I the last to know about this place???"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The veggies and herbs the bring are always fresh. The pho is amazing and the staff are always super nice. and OMG the shaved snow...its heaven. This is our go to Pho shop and will continue to be. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to get some pho and was really not pleased with our visit. We had been here a few times but granted it had been awhile. Half the things on their menu they were out of because they \"were going to close for the holidays\". I guess that was suppose to mean they didn't order food since they were going to close?!   We ordered the snoh and had asked for extra toppings. They gave us so much snoh and VERY little toppings (as you can see in pic below). Maybe it was just not the time to go since it was a couple days before Christmas, but if your not going to care about the food you serve before the holidays then you should just don't close for that time, just an opinion.  The service well let's just say it matched the food."}
{"text":"Pho Avina is the place to go for delicious Vietnamese cuisine! The pho has an abundance of meat and the broth is very flavorful. I also like to go in for the boba which is one of the few places that actually serve it on the west side of town. I recently went in and they just started serving shaved snow and macaroons! I don't know of any other place that has these tasty treats. The shaved snow comes in different sizes as well as different flavors and has so many toppings to choose from. I tried the coffee snow with almonds, lychee, and condensed milk and I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Tisk tisk what a shame.. warning don't show up if they're going to close in 40 minutes because they won't serve you!  I have come to Avinas since 2002 when it was on Bell Rd.  It use to be personal service, the food was always great.  This has continued until tonight.  WHO turns away customers 40 mins before you close?  It took a word to flush 16 years of loyalty down the drain.  Won't be back and simply don't understand this mentality.  So when people ask me which Vietnamese restaurant to recommend I'll start by saying don't come to this place... ever! Then I will recommend that they go to a good place like Angelina's Pho & Grill or Phoenix Pho.  My only regret about this post is I couldn't rate it a ZERO, but I guess it one there's always room to go down from here."}
{"text":"The food was good. The broth of the chicken pho was so delicious it was hard to stop and eat other things I ordered. The waiter didn't have any suggestions for what kids would like and I didn't really like that as I have kiddos with me all the time and would have love an in house opinion."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The service is fast (as long as you're ordering pho) and friendly and the vegetable spring rolls are the best I've ever had. Perfect for a quick bite in between classes or really any other occasion."}
{"text":"Stopped in after reading the reviews.  I arrived about 12:50PM.  It was packed. By 1:15 the place had cleared out pretty much. I ordered to-go and waited by the front counter. Their staff was working very hard. They were all running around helping customers. They were all moving VERY fast.  The place was clean and they proudly posted their health rating of A on their front door and counter. I like that!  I ordered the Pho Tai, spring rolls and calamari. The Pho was great. I order the beef raw so it can cook in the hot broth to my liking. Plenty of beef was served.  The spring rolls were good.  The calamari was over-breaded and not cooked all the way through. It was also over-salted. More breading than calamari. I will pass on this item next time."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time the other day even though I have lived by it for a long time. It wasn't until a friend suggested it that I had the guts to just go for it and see if I liked it and I did. I chose the # 62 which was pretty good and I even tried a boba drink which was also very good. I love Little Saigon but Pho Avin will be my new back up place if I don't feel like driving. I really recommend both places for good inexpensive food with enough to fill you up."}
{"text":"I  have been coming to this place for 6 years, and now I have to tell you that I  am  very disappointed.   After the former business owner sold to current owner, the portion of the dishes were so small, and taste of the broth was less tasty yet prices were raised.  Unfortunately, I am not coming back anymore."}
{"text":"Pho Avina is awesome! The service is always good. The restaurant is always busy. I usually have pho, but on occasion I have the BÚN CH GIÒ THT NUONG. The egg roll is crispy and the meat has a good grilled flavor. The mango boba is my favorite. It always amazes me how I can get boba and the drink to alternate to look like stripes! Unfortunately, I just learned last night that the owner is retiring. The new owner will take over on December 1. Stay tuned for a post review with new ownership. This is my brother's favorite pho restaurant. I broke the news to him last night. He's devastated!"}
{"text":"With competition at a bare zero, Pho Avina provides that quick pho fix that is almost as necessary as heroin is to an addict. The soup definitely has some characteristics but ultimately lacks any oomph. The meat portions are on the chintzy side and the spring rolls are a pass. The service is above standard and there definitely is a family feel.   Is it worth visiting? Carbon footprint-wise absolutely. But is it really enough to merely alleviate that craving or does it need to blow you away like it was your first time every time?"}
{"text":"Pho Avina is delicious! I ordered pho dac biet - special beef soup, really good! Also try ordering their shaved ice and boba tea, delectable! Service was so and so. Waiter wasn't informal and hesitated to pick up our bowls and plates."}
{"text":"There's nothing like some hot pho on a rainy night. Last night brought in one of the worst storms in 17 years, but I braved the rain to get out and have a big bowl of noodles at Pho Avina.  Pho Avina is a family-run operation where they greet you cheerfully and remember your order if you are a regular. It's a small restaurant, but it's clean and the service is fast and friendly. I have always felt like it was family serving me when I've dined there.  To date, this is the best place for pho noodles that I've been able to find in Phoenix. I'm pretty stuck on the meatball and shrimp pho, which is my usual order, but I also love the Bún ch giò deluxe. The pho comes out incredibly hot, and after adding a good dose of Sriracha sauce, fresh basil, cilantro, and lime, is ready to eat. But first put your face over the bowl and inhale deeply, as that's the best way to understand why pho is such a wonderfully delicious meal. :)  I highly recommend a visit to Pho Avina if you are in the mood for some great Vietnamese cuisine, especially the pho. The spring roll appetizer is also quite delicious while you wait for your pho as well!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the best Vietnamese food in all of AZ, and I know Vietnamese food.  I travelled through Vietnam for 6 weeks!  I have also tried several other places, and there are a few good competitors hitting AZ, but Avina's is still the best!  The Pho broth is awesome!  I love the roll your own menu.  I am addicted to spicy beef roll your own!  In the past few years, she added boba, snow, and macarones.  ALL DELICIOUS!  If you're a Vietnamese coffee addict like me, and you want a treat, a coffee boba is the best of both worlds!  If you like Asian food, especially Vietnamese, I recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Simply fantastic! The Pho broth is exceptional, and all of the ingredients are fresh and delicious. If you're looking for authentic Pho in the valley, this place is the best. Period."}
{"text":"We have been loyal Avinas customers since the 90's, when it was owned by Avina and her family, they used to recognize our kiddos. We went to High-school with the daughter, they however have recently sold it, before then, 5 stars, consistent taste, quality, and service. Ugh, now that it has been sold it's awful, we ordered what we usually do; and it was greasy and gross, totally lost the taste, called in for take out and literally stood around for 5 minutes waiting for someone to help me once I arrived to pick it up. The prices increased as well, we will not returning and will need to find another Vietnamese restaurant to go to.  Bummer! Also, 2nd the below review, there is now a rehab center and job help place in that complex and it is almost scary to get out of the vehicle, people are always asking for money."}
{"text":"this is my favorite restaurant !!! I like the fired rice and most students are enjoy the foods in avina"}
{"text":"I have been coming to pho avina for a few years now and they have pretty good food so that's why I keep coming back. But this last few times I have dined there the service has been awful. This last time especially. They took forever to come get our order, and it wasn't a busy night for them. Then after we got our food no one came back to check on us or refill our water. We even had to get our own Togo containers. Then the check never came and we had to go up to the front to pay for our meal. It's disappointing because I do enjoy the food, but this will hinder me wanting to come back."}
{"text":"Pho is amazing and staff is vert friendly. Very clean inside and nice variety of dishes."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is amazing and fresh.  Great Price and the plate side is generous.  I always want to try something new  the bobas are the best.  I've never had issues w the service"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for Vietnamese food in Arizona. The broth is well seasoned and their egg rolls are tasty. Service is always fast and attentive. They even offered me water while waiting for my take-out one time! The Boba isn't so bad but I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"I love this place! The prices are good, bowls are huge and the service is very fast & friendly!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is great for the area. It's been hard to find a Pho place in North Phoenix that I really like and I finally did it. I went with the Egg Noodle soup which some would argue isn't true Pho but I say boo to that!  The spring rolls were great as well. They weren't too sticky and had plenty of meat inside them. The service here was great as well, what nice people. The lunch crowd was huge but they still provided very quick service and were attentive on refilling my drink anytime it was empty. I have a feeling I will be a regular here real quick!"}
{"text":"Love the Steak Pho! Tastes great. The Boba and milk tea's are good too! The service could be a little bit better. Overall, good place!"}
{"text":"I give Pho Avina a 4.5 out of 5. I love going to this place. I'm addicted to their boba. The thai tea and soursop boba are my favorite. I always get spring rolls and beef or chicken pho. The service is really fast and very nice. I go to Pho Avina at least once a week to get my boba and pho fix."}
{"text":"Best Pho hands down, Boba bar has a good selection. Very clean too!"}
{"text":"This is a small mom-and-pop place across from the ASU West campus that caters to a mix of students, locals, and the small number of Asians in the Phoenix area.  I've only been there a couple of times during lunch for the popular Vietnamese subs (banh mi).  The combination pork roll is a baguette made up of thinly sliced pickled carrots, daikon, onions, cilantro, and meat or tofu. Popular bánh mì fillings include pork, paté, and chicken.   The subs were pretty good, but you can't complain as they are less than $4.  Also, the pho looked good and I will definitely return to try another time."}
{"text":"Great Pho and great boba! The thai tea one is my favorite."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for a quick boba. Best boba I have had so far. The shaved ice menu looks amazing! Definitely trying that next!   If you guy 2 bobas you get 1 green tea boba FREE!"}
{"text":"This area is just lined with restaurants.  Just about every restaurant you can think of. But the ethnic ones are always a bit off the main strip, so we were excited, well I was, to find one of the few Vietnamese restaurants.   I'm excited to see certain authentic Vietnamese dishes like bun Bo hue. But I needed pho. This girl needed.pho. PHO!!!  Erik on the other hand wanted eggrolls. Not as an appetizer. Well as an appetizer but also as his main course. But I managed to order him something more substantial.    The eggrolls. They're small and that goes for the order size as well. Two, 2. That's all you get. It sucks.   Anyways, Erik wasn't too happy with the order size I've and the flavor. He wasn't thrilled.  He actually praised Viet Kitchen's eggrolls better.   The pho was decent. Erik got a noodle nest with sautéed veggies and beef. Be felt the beef was too chewy but they seemed fine to me.   So would I go again if I'm in the area? Probably, and would try another dish or two. At least I found a vietnamese place....yay!!!"}
{"text":"The elderly woman who works there (pictured in the reviews and photographs along the walls) is very helpful in pointing out veggie friendly items. I had the vermicelli bowl with veggies and spring rolls (no fish sauce). Quite delicious... No leftovers. My bf enjoyed his Pho Ga. For dessert I ordered the sweet potato cake with pineapple sauce which I was told was just sweet potato, flour, and water. Very good. Far too sweet as an appetizer though. Good family restaurant. Wish it was closer to la casa!"}
{"text":"In addition to their DELICIOUS food (I usually get the special beef pho, shredded pork skin spring rolls, and my husband gets the grilled pork vermicelli with egg rolls), Pho Avina has now added snow ice dessert and French Macarons in ASIAN FLAVORS: Taro, Black Sesame, Mango, Lychee, Coconut, Durian, Vietnamese coffee Strawberry, Green Tea and Honeydew! This is the ONLY place I have ever come across some of these flavors in macarons (and I've tried many macarons in Los Angeles area patisseries, where you would think you could find more exotic flavors). Fantastic job, Avina!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Avina's for years with my parents. Their food is home made and delicious. The owner is either out on the floor taking orders or in the back helping with the cooking. My favorite dish is the Avinas special cat fish. They have great egg rolls, both spring and summer. Every trip there makes me feel like I'm in Vietnam."}
{"text":"I truly love the foods in avina, and I always hang out with my friends in this place for eating!!!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer at Pho Avina for years. What initially led me to patronize this restaurant is the affordable entrees and quick service. Food quality was usually above average - good. Service has never been especially friendly, but at least it was expedient. However, I feel the need to echo the voices of several others who have indicated that the quality of food and service at this restaurant has gone downhill dramatically, to the extent that I am no longer a fan of this establishment.  First off, food quality at Pho Avina has been on the decline. Previously delightful entrees are now of mediocre quality. Service has also been on the downward spiral. Pho Avina waiters are definitely still as efficient as ever, but they are not responsive to customer needs. Errors in taking orders are common here, and I cannot count the number of times I have had to remind the waiter to bring an appetizer (usually spring rolls) or drink (boba tea).  To illustrate an example of bad service combined with bad food, take for example my latest foray with my wife and child to Pho Avina...  It seldom rains in Phoenix, but when it does, I love to get a bowl of hot Pho. Imagine my disappointment when, rushing in from the pouring rain, I discover that the restaurant is out of beef broth with which to prepare Pho. The restaurant was pretty busy, so I could understand that everyone else probably had the same idea I did. The waiter suggested I try some Pho with chicken broth instead. I decided to order the Chicken Pho from the menu. Wife ordered chicken friend rice. My wife's order came rather quickly, which is normal at this restaurant. Mine took a long time to come, which is odd considering that they usually deliver Pho at the speed of light. When it came, I was hungry and ready to dig in to a steaming hot bowl of delicious Pho... but when I took the first sip of the broth, I almost spat it out. I do not exaggerate when I say that the \"broth\" tasted like hot water with some oil mixed in. There was no chicken flavor, in fact hardly any flavor of any kind. I had my wife try the broth too and she agreed - the broth lacked any flavor. Even adding hoisin sauce to the broth failed to rescue the insipid soup. Normally, I do not like complaining to the management since I rather avoid drama during mealtime, but my wife convinced me to raise this issue up with the management. I told the waiter the problem with my Pho soup. He promised to bring this up to the attention of the management. My wife and I heard discussion emanating from the back kitchen with some recognizable words (\"chicken\", \"broth\", etc... you get the idea). About five minutes later, the elderly lady who seems to run the place comes up to us and apologizes. This could have ended, if not well, at least better. But here was the real kicker. She asked us if we would like another bowl of soup to replace the one that was \"defective.\" Bear in mind that this was at the end of the meal, after my wife and I had finished most of our food. The Pho bowl was absent meat and noodles (I was hungry as I had mentioned, and swallowed the edible parts, leaving the \"soup\" behind), my wife's fried rice was gone, we were both no longer hungry, and we were being offered another bowl of soup. I am assuming she meant without the noodles/other ingredients but we were at this point no longer interested either way, so we said that we were full, but extremely disappointed that the broth tasted like dishwater. At this point, the elderly lady explained that they had a very busy night, and that \"somebody\" had added water to the stock, diluting it, which was the cause of our tasteless soup.  And that was that! She walked away. No offer of compensation, or maybe a free bowl of Pho on our next visit, nothing. Also, I should mention that the lady had recognized us as repeat, loyal customers (she said that she knows that we patronize the restaurant all the time).  I want to say that I am not here to bring down any establishment unfairly and I am not one of those particularly fussy customers that demands perfection. I seldom like to complain, unless I feel really unfairly treated. But this level of service is deplorable. If the Pho broth had been reasonably tasty or even slightly bland, I would still have let the issue go. But it was completely devoid of any taste, and to have the manager admit the mistake and offer no compensation of any sort - well let's just say there are two other Vietnamese restaurants within 5 miles of Pho Avina, and I will be bringing my business to the competition in the future."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat.  The food is fantastic and the prices are very reasonable.  We have tried quiet a bit of the menu and have not been really disappointed yet.  I always seem to come back to the #23 extra large bowl of soup.  It's enough for dinner that night and lunch tomorrow.  The Bobas are really tasty as well.  This place is certainly worht a look."}
{"text":"I just moved to Glendale from Northern California, where Pho restaurants are accessible within a mile radius of where I used to live and work. I was craving some home cooked goodness, but since my mom wasn't here to make a stew pot of pho that could feed me for weeks, I decided to try this place with a friend who heard it was the best pho in town.   For starters, walking in, it definitely looked like a Vietnamese joint with the cheap looking chairs, hoison sauce and sriracha sitting on a lazy susan on the side of the table with the typical utensils necessary for pho. I'm kind of used to walking into a pho place and coming out smelling like it, and as much as I was happy to come across this place, it was a bit of a bummer that I couldn't smell the soup from the parking lot.   The pho was good, not great or what I'm used to, but it hit the spot. I'm taking off one star for two reasons. Pho shouldn't be served with shrimp ( I don't know who decided to put that in) but it definitely aint tradition. And the second reason was that the Vietnamese Crepes that I dream about eating when I go home for the holidays tasted borderline nasty. I don't know if it was the grease or just the flavor, but I was a bit bummed that this didn't taste better. My friend can attest that I was very excited to order this to go for dinner!  I think that the rest of the food probably tastes good. I think I want to try their spicy beef noodle and chicken pho. It could have been hit or miss with what I ate that day. I definitely like the service that we got. Some places kind of rush you to get in, eat, and get out, but here, they came by and refilled our water, and checked to make sure everything was ok, so two thumbs up for that!  I'm still on the hunt for the best pho place in town, so if anyone knows of one, wanna shoot me a line??"}
{"text":"The food here is great! Try their rice plates and pho bowls, you can't go wrong! Their service is what is lacking unfortunately, I asked for a glass of water twice until I finally recieved it. No servers come up to the customers to see how the food is or if there is anything else needed like refills. Good food and service: the two essential factors of a successful restaurant."}
{"text":"I unfortunately have to update my review to one star. I came in today with a co-worker for lunch. Nothing was wrong with the food but there was an incident.  One of the waiters spilled broth all down my back. The waiter knew what he did and said \"Oh\"...but didn't bother to say a word to me. I only noticed what he had done after I felt the broth soaking into my clothes.  I grabbed napkins and started to clean off my clothes and nothing was still said to me. It was only when I went to ask for my check, a guy by the name of Andy simply said \"sorry about that.\" I asked what I was supposed to do if my clothes ended up with oil stains. He said \"It was only broth. It's not going to stain. It's not like it was red wine or anything...And it was really only a few drops...\" So I told him, \"No, there is oil...so it CAN stain! and NO, It wasn't a few drops. My entire back is wet.\" Again, his response...\"Oh, well sorry.\" I'm beyond furious and it blows my mind that if I hadn't said anything, they wouldn't have even cared!! Rest assured, they will be getting the dry cleaning bill if these spots don't come out!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here they have no boba. Also the last three times I've come here no one has checked on me. I get seated and then about thirty minutes goes by before I go find someone to help me. I came here again tonight to give it one last chance and worst experience ever. No boba again and I also got cold soup and hard noodles. Server NEVER CHECKED ON US. Not once. Also took forty minutes to get our food that wasn't even cooked properly. Forgot our take out orders so we had to wait another fifteen minutes after already waiting thirty assuming they had remembered. We had to go to the counter to ask about it. And also when I gave my soup back the server gave me attitude and muttered \"stupid\" under his breathe. Not a single one of the four of us enjoyed our food. NONE of us will be coming here ever again. New management has destroyed this place."}
{"text":"IT'S SUCH A RIPOFF when they expanded their restaurant.  I use to like coming here until they expanded their restaurant.  They hoarded BIG TIME with the Pho soups by putting less and less ingredients and charging way too much for what BROTH and a couple of noodles and a couple of pieces of chicken or beef.  I found another Pho restaurant which most of you will love, it's called PHOLICIOUS!  There is no other Pho soup in both Glendale and Peoria that make the best soups ever.  I've been going to PHOLICIOUS for two years and they haven't cheated with the ingredients very much like Pho Avina does.  They didn't have a working toilet for the six years I went there, you had to go to Taco Bell or Arby's nearby.  Occasionally you still have to.  The boba was awful, watery and no boba!  Too damn expensive for a bowl of water and a watery drink.  The vegetarian spring rolls were horrendous and amateurishly made."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Great staff and tasty food! Buy a shirt and receive 10% off for life. Speedy service and excellent pho. Spring rolls and egg rolls also very tasty!"}
{"text":"I'd recommend this place highly for two situations:  1.) You are on the west side of town and you want some reasonably priced grub, 2.) You've never had Vietnamese food and you want to try it out in a non-intimidating environment.  For those two things, PA is awesome!     Nice people, decent food, and a very friendly environment. But their food doesn't stack up to the central Phoenix standard bearers.  I suppose that their score is artificially low because of the category they are competing in.  Were they the only game in town, I suspect I would have rated them much higher - just to get my hands on a Bahn Mi every now and again."}
{"text":"I take snacking to a level only attainable by few when I go to Pho Avina. Though I have eaten a full meal here, I am only going to review my favorite snack.   I love getting a boba tea and the veggie spring rolls after I get out of class or when my boytoy and I go tandem-ing. The service here isn't the fastest, but I don't mind waiting for the delicious food.   The peanut sauce really takes the a-ok veggie spring rolls out of this world. If I could find a discreet way to lick the sauce container after my rolls are finished, oh boy I would.   The boba tea compliments the spring rolls well. My personal favorite is the coconut, but all of the other flavors I've tried are good as well.   Just a quick tip: $10 minimum on all credit/debit card purchases."}
{"text":"Just what happened on this place? I have not dine here for 1 year because it was far from my new place. Today I gathered with the family and ate dinner here. A group of 10+ People with kids. The place is still packed like the last time we came here but the people that used to work here are gone. The old lady that greets us everytime is nowhere to be found. There are new servers,younger ones and this new servers are a bit rude. And iam being nice when I said \"bit\". Even the people who were with me noticed the change. This people are not avid yelpers but i knew I have to change my review when the oldest of the group said \" our server don't like us huh? \". . .  Attitude aside, I must also report the change on the food. Most of this people ate here before. I ordered more than I could handle tonight, and there's a reason for that. I needed to make sure that I was only imagining or if my taste buds were off. Yet I was not alone with my assumptions, this place has lost its flavors. I ordered G3, the springroll, a soup(pho), and a even a bobba. The soup alone would have been enough for me. But I really wanted to make sure that I  won't be making accusations with the flavoring. The soup is bland, very bland, my gf even ordered her favorite here: the meatball soup  and she puked :( (sorry for that info). Anyways the other soup I had was so bland that I needed to put alot of soy, sarachi,alone other stuff to get some kind of flavor on it. The springroll came undone and I had to ask them to rewrap it. The G3 was the biggest problem. I know I am no chef, but I know when the food served to me is not fresh. This meat were NOt fresh. U cut to them and their not tender rather they have a rubber band effect. Man I swear I could not t take any more of it.  Anyways as I always say on my reviews, please try them for your own sake. I AM pretty sure some people will still like them. But hey I know for sure I am not going back here. As an option please go to 43rd ave pho if you guys want a better quality pho and  oh and that service.  I brought the food home. My dog will have vietnamese food for supper."}
{"text":"I'm always really hesitant to review places that are literally across the street from ASU West (where I take classes and work) because I worry that my opinion of the business is skewed by its convenience, but to hell with parliamentary procedure, I've got to russle up some FUC's!  At the computer lab at West we have a whole drawer of our office dedicated to take out menus. It is as expansive as it is useless, because the answer is always \"something Asian\". The only times we've ever used one of the many pizza menus we have is when our bosses offer to buy us lunch, because we fear letting them know what food we really like will give them some sort of power over us.   So yesterday John S (who is Clarice's boyfriend but was my +1 for the yelp event, what's with that?) and I were doing our usual lunchtime shuffle, passing around menus for Chen Wok and Fu-Sing Garden. We came across a menu for Pho Avina. We initially saw the word \"pho\" and collectively agreed that Pholicious sounded like a brilliant idea, but we were looking for takeout and the staff at Pholicious is so awesome to me on a regular basis that I'd hate to dis them by walking in, giving them an order, and then loitering outside while they made it for me.   Thankfully, John solved my culinary quandary by mentioning that he really liked the boba at Pho Avina. The last time I had boba I liked was at a Quickly! in the bay almost two years ago. The Lollicup near my house, which was promoting itself as if it's shit didn't stink but had weird, unpredictable hours and always managed to be \"out\" of boba whenever I was really craving it. So Pho Avina it was.  Ordering was only a minor travesty. The restaurant is so tiny and compact that the only place to put their register/takeout counter is right next to the path of the servers, so in the couple of minutes it took us to place our order we managed to obstruct every other employee working there. Thankfully, despite the complaints of my fellow yelper girls, I wear heels about 90 percent of the time, which makes me I'm easy to spot and never surprise someone turning a corner. If they run into me it's because they're jerks and want to see if I'll say \"excuse me\" and give away my gender. Puny non-yelpers. The mighty Jetta is not fooled by your nonsense.  We spent the fifteen minute waiting period out and about the strip mall, reading The New Times and visiting the nearby gaming store which I'm going to yelp anyway despite not buying anything. 15 minutes isn't a bad waiting time for egg noodle soup and boba. I've waited longer for a cheezburger and shake. Oh jesus, did I just spell \"cheeseburger\" with a z? I know I should correct it, but I feel compelled to leave it there. the internet has permanently fucked my cognitive language skills.   I ordered the #41 (egg noodle, shrimp, crab, calamari) and a coconut boba. John ordered the old school \"beef and rice noodle\" pho and a taro boba which he could not describe the flavor of and whenever asked how it was or how it tasted kept thrusting it in my face and telling me to try some. The sense of urgency in his voice didn't compel me to want to take that leap.  The takeout arrangement was both clever, convenient, and troublesome. In our bag were two styrofoam cups of soup, little baggies of warm noodles, and a ziploc of cilantro, sprouts, peppers, and limes. While this made taking our lunch back to the office quick and easy, it did cause some problems in unloading its contents. The noodles, while still warm, were beginning to stick to each other and solidify, which made stuffing it in the cup of broth rather difficult, especially when the noodles didn't separate once submerged. The portions of noodles were relatively small, and I ended up having to put in handfuls of sprouts just to adequately fill the cup, which itself was modest at best. I know I would've gotten more if we had ordered dine-in.   I don't mean to sound like another one of those portion-obsessed Americans, but with work and school and Aramark's price-gouging at our cafeteria, my lunch has to hold me over for the whole day. And this didn't work out for me.  The food (what little of it was there), was actually quite tasty. The squid was chewy, the crab meat tasted real, and the two shrimp that were in there were pretty massive. The broth was hands down the best part. I could drink a whole bowl of that shit. But won't. Because too much sodium is never fun.  I realized waaaaaay after the fact that what we had ordered was not in fact boba milk tea but in fact \"snow bubble milk tea\" (i.e. frozen boba). The pearls were frozen solid and hard to chew and more than one my straw did the \"McDonald's Choke\" where the contents became so cold they would not submit to the vacuum I was creating. Eventually I just let it sit on my desk for a half hour where it melted and was then delicious.  [Joke about how lesbians aren't as good at sucking things as other people has been omitted.

{"text":"This morning I saw a review for Pho Avina in the Republic.. well the Republic isn't always a reliable source but for me Ive been all about the Vietnamese fare. It just so happens this week I'm house sitting on the west side so decided to have an early dinner on my way out.   What's funny is this place is right on the edge of my old stomping grounds. My elementary school is just a few blocks from there.. of course there were memories of my first kiss.. my first girlfriend.. none of which actually took place there but hey memories, cant control 'em.  I decided that I was going to be hungry for a Vietnamese sandwich called Bahn Mi as well as a bowl of soup, pho. Got the sammie, the special with pork roll, cilantro, cucumber, jalapeo, pickled carrots and daikon on crusty French bread. This was very satisfying.. while not as great as Da Vang it held its own.   I also ordered the Vietnamese style beef stew called Bun Bo Ko.. thick tender chunks of beef in a rich and complex broth served with cilantro, lime, bean sprouts and jalapeo along with vermicelli noodles. This was off the hook tasty! The flavors were sweet, savory, slightly spicy and YUM-E!    The service is very friendly and welcoming. The interior won't win any design contests but here, its all about the food!  They take plastic.. this is always an important aspect to me as I rarely carry cash.."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Pho, It was fresh and full of flavor.  My new place to go when I feel a cold coming on.  Waiter was typical of these types of places, ie: just ok."}
{"text":"Chunky mango and taro boba was good. Soft noodle combo dish was descent but luke warm when served. I was disappointed to learn that bahn mi was only offered during lunch."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star eatery.  Spring rolls were delicious.  Vietnamese coffee was killer. I passed on the Pho and went for the sliced pork with egg, meatloaf, and rice with pickled veg.......yummo!!  First visit here, as I heard that this place has killer Vietnamese sandwiches (Banh-mi) but unfortunately for me the sandwiches are only on M-F 11-3:00 pm.  So I will be back to this delightful West-Side Vietnamese joint."}
{"text":"Pho sho! This place was really good! I'm actually not a huge pho fan but I went here on a rare chilly day in the valley and I was pleasantly surprised. Combo #52 bun dac biet and the spring rolls were amazingly good and totally comforting, and holy huge portions!! I also couldn't get away without trying the pork egg rolls, there's something so fun about eating Vietnamese egg rolls! If you've never had them I say, DO IT! But people please do it right! First take that crispy roll and wrap it in the lettuce with the fresh cilantro and herbs then dip and devour!  You can thank me later. Ps the staff was so sweet if you aren't familiar with the cuisine they'll help you out. I'm glad I went and it won't be the last time!"}
{"text":"#31 steak and brisket pho has been haunting my dreams! I seriously can't stop thinking about it and am constantly craving it. I've tried their other pho combinations and have to say this one is by far my favorite.   I used to come here when this restaurant was super tiny and it always felt so cramped and congested since there was usually a lot of people coming and going either trying to get a seat or picking up orders. This is the first time I've come in after their expansion and it has a little bit of a different feel but the additional space is really nice.   #31, I'm coming back for you!!! (drool)"}
{"text":"Green tea shaved ice with fresh mango is so good!! Can't wait to try their pho and other dishes. 5 stars for their service!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pho that phoenix has to offer. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that the portions are not as generous as they used to be. 3 slices of beef in a bowl of pho tai is just playing with my emotions. Also, they are closed on Sundays which is a darn shame. Luckily Nam Sao is open on Sunday."}
{"text":"Great food for an affordable price! Wondering place great food. Fresh and they're fast! Pork spring rolls amazing!"}
{"text":"This was a stop on my Pho Tour of Phoenix when Angelina's was closed on Monday. Very casual, but very good. Very affordable prices with a friendly and attentive staff. For sweet tooths there is a \"shaved ice\" and fruit corner where you can get your Filipino sugar rush on. Glad I found this place on my GPS in a pinch and I would definitely revisit."}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the Valley. Easily.  It's clean, the food portions are huge, the prices are great, service is wonderful. I have no complaints.   Recommendations: Spring Rolls ($3 for 2), #46 Rice Vermicelli with salad and grilled pork ($6.50), and the Pho is good too."}
{"text":"Honestly I just gave 5 stars cuz they give you a large boba drink for the price of a small if you give them a good rating soooo"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating here a few Saturdays ago on a blind date :) I was craving some Pho and my date was like sure, I have never had it before so lets go. We ordered the pork and shrimp spring rolls which by the way were filled with tons of shrimp. I knew that had to have been a mistake because I swear I had a bite of shrimp each time. Not that I am complaining one bit! I ordered the Chicken and Shrimp soup (Do you see a theme? lol) and my friend kept it safe and just ordered the fried rice, which he says was some of the best he has ever had. My soup came out piping hot with tons of chicken and shrimp and herbs. I was one happy campy. So why the four stars if everything was good. The bathroom had a weird smell to it. I know, I know what does that have to do with the rest of the place. Well if you got to go potty and the bathroom stinks, it kinds of throws you off you know. I will go back as the food was really good, I will just remember to avoid the bathroom next time :)"}
{"text":"Somehow we have been hanging out at Imperial Outpost, the nearby game store, for years, without ever eating at this place. Fortunately, we remedied that error and won't make it again in the future. Awesome pho at a good price considering the size of the portion. Don't forget to add the plate of garnish to your soup. I thought it was missing a layer of flavor until I realized that the fresh parsley, cilantro, bean sprouts and lime wedge were intended to go IN the soup. It was perfect after that, and the oxtail version was only $7.99 for a huge bowl of soup that came with three good-sized oxtails. I think in the future I'd try the soup with round steak instead since it is a bit cheaper. We also had a pasta dish I'm sure I couldn't pronounce but it was delicious too. The pho was my favorite though. I'd never tried boba before but the one we had was good and there were tons of flavors available.  I've seen some of the complaints about the service, but it was awesome when we were there. We were greeted at the door and they took our order and brought the food pretty quickly. Restaurant was a bit on the loud/echo-y side but there was a pretty consistent flow of people in and out the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"The pho was excellent.  Probably my second favorite in the valley, next to Viet Kitchen.   However, service was bad.  I was the only one in there, and had to ask for a water refill while the waitresses were gathered around a phone giggling. And the men's bathroom was gross.  I washed my hands, but looking at the door & the light switch, my hands were probably dirty than before I washed them."}
{"text":"Love this spot ! Super close to my house and it never disappoints, if you go you must try the pork egg rolls they are hands down the best that I have tried. I have yet to try their entrees every time I go their pho is too good to pass up! I don't think I've ever left here dissatisfied in the past three years I've been coming here"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 10 years and i will tell you this that i will only eat PHO here!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week as a lunch date with one of my work buddies. Always quick and the food is delicious. It is never disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge review poster. I do it when I feel a company deserves it or not. Positive or negative.  Well. Holy moly. This place is AMAZING. I ordered beef pho, bbq pork fried rice and pork egg rolls. DELICIOUS DELICIOUS DELICIOUS!!!!  They were super friendly and the BBQ fried rice is so colorful and fresh looking and the taste is so yummy!! I'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Found myself on the Westside and of course had to sample some well reviewed and well rated Pho! This is very nice Pho and fortunately for me I have four I ranked slightly higher that are closer to me in the East Valley, as this is very far to go for Pho. VERY nice broth, lots of meat (although a couple of pieces were a little tough) served by the little Vietnamese Lady who obviously is responsible for its delicate flavor. Beats out lots of very well regarded \"Pho Joints,\" quite handily. Nice surprise and very close to my #3 ranked Pho Phind!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I come here about 2-3 times a week during my lunch at work, and no matter what I order the food is always fresh and filling! Very well mannered servers that always treat me with respect. Ngoc is my favorite server here! If you decide to come ask for her!"}
{"text":"I met Craig W here for lunch today.  We both had egg rolls.  I had pho with sliced beef and shrimp.  Craig had a vermicelli stew of some sort and a Boba drink.  I was full but not stuffed, Craig could not finish his.  When it comes to Vietnamese food I am still learning how to pick what I want and add stuff to make it my creation without overwhelming the taste of how it started.  I liked what I had and will most certainly return to try something else.  We arrived towards the end of lunch hour and there was a large party in the center of the restaurant and we got the only free table.  I think they understand lunch hours and did a good job of getting us served quickly."}
{"text":"This review is just for the shaved snow ice.  I saw pics and heard other foodies talk about they have new desserts to try.  So after Tomo, we decided to drive up North for dessert.  Snow that is.  I ordered the coconut flavor with light condense milk and wafers.  The coconut snow ice is cream and had good flavored, but the condense milk was WAY too sweet.  For the small, it was only a few bites it done.  For the price, it was not worth it for the amount you got.    The food looked good, so I will be back to try the noodles and stuff."}
{"text":"Worst place ever I don't think I've ever left a review and you guys are F!&$ING terrible, we sat down for 20 mins waiting and then two ass holes just kicked us out, we asked for a manager he said no one here is in charge then we asked if we can simply talk to a supervisor anyone willing to make a decision and still noting the place is a joke I guess some business don't want to stay in business it will be my goal to shut this place down that's for sure!!!! We drove over 30 mins just to get the and then sat 20 mins and they give us this BULL$#&!, damn this is upsetting just to write this all but THEY DESERVE IT WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! To bad I can't comment on ur comment, You're place is a JOKE, if you or any other manager was their I'd curse you out in person for TERRIBLE establishment. And if you know anything about business and I hope you would since you're claiming you've been serving for 25 years and still don't realize if you say 9 is when u close then 9 is when you close,and please don't blame you're health problems we all have problems today! You might want to go see a doctor tho just incase ur have mental ones to!!!"}
{"text":"Pho Avina excels in beef pho with its very sweet and not too oily broth. Their chicken pho has more of a Chinese wonton soup broth, but it's still very good if you're feeling a cold coming on. They also do a great job with rice dishes, my favorite is #58. The rest of other dishes they offer like spring rolls and Vietnamese sandwiches are good, but nothing to rave about. Although, they do offer very good boba drinks. It's arguably better than Viet Kitchen and Pho Thanh. I go here all the time for the past two years and highly recommend."}
{"text":"3 star without Boba. Boba boosts them up to 4 star.  Pho lacks meat and you will stay hungry unless you get some extra meat in there.  Kinda sparse with the herbs and the spices. Not the best Pho I've had, but hey, they do well.  Service is.. meh. They aren't really service oriented. Take your order and don't bother you style."}
{"text":"The pho here is great (as usual) but when we ordered shaved ice, the red bean topping was completely rancid (as someone who grew up eating red bean paste, it really shouldn't taste sour from the first bite). The owner did not pay us back our money. When they remade the shaved ice it was topped with the worst mochi I have ever tasted.   Beware of spoiled food here!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Pho Avina, but definitely not my first time with Vietnamese food.  I was in a hurry and needed a quick, tasty lunch on my way to class.  First off, this place is in a great location as it is less than one block from campus.  It is also clean and welcoming restaurant.  Secondly, the staff was extremely friendly; the gentleman who took my to-go order even opened my order to show me what was there and how to combine the ingredients for a traditional experience, although I already knew what to do.  Third, I ordered the #51 \"Bun Tom Bi Cha Gio Thit Nuong\" with chicken.  I waited for no more than 15 minutes as I watched the service staff effectively and quickly attend quests as they walked in.  As, I mentioned above the server who helped me showed me what I was getting and I immediately wanted to sit down and dig in.  Instead I drove to campus and hurried to sit down so I could and combine the cup of fish sauce seasoned dressing with the heaping traditional salad accompaniment and the noodles and meat.  Along with perfectly grilled and seasoned chicken there was a crunchy, delicious egg roll snuggled between shrimp and shredded pork both perfectly seasoned and cooked.  It was enough food for two meals and I will definitely go back for more, maybe some Pho next time."}
{"text":"I came here to eat today, ordered shrimp pho which I usually order, I noticed the change of taste and the temperature of my soup, which is not the ordinary, I found out that there is a new management since couple years ago , no wonder ! I hope they keep everything the same way how the original owner kept it,"}
{"text":"Almost got scammed, be extra careful about your bill.  I came here on a Friday afternoon for a quick bite. I clearly ordered something that's 10 bucks on their menu, but on my way out, they charged me almost 17 bucks. I pointed it out when i received my check, the waiter was pretty nice and apologized, however, the old lady, who i assume is the manager/owner? was extremely rude. She literally told me, and i'm quoting \"you ate it and you have to pay for it, you don't have to come back in the future\". Seriously? This is like the worst customer service i have ever experienced.  Then she kept saying something about a \"price change\" which makes no sense because if there was a price change, why was not shown on the menu?? I insisted on paying just the 10 bucks because that is the price i saw when i ordered my food. I wish i can give this place zero stars, the old lady was not only unprofessional, but straight up rude. Although the waiter was a pretty cool dude, but still, there will be no chance of me returning to this place ever again."}
{"text":"This place is a good place to try out Vietnamese food. Came here twice and their food is still awesome. Drop one star for slow service. Anyway, I will still be back."}
{"text":"What can I say about Avina.. Well, this was the second time I've eatin here. My boyfriend and I ate here on Saturday afternoon, the place was very comfortable, almost all the tables were filled. We started off with an order  of  Spring Rolls and Egg Rolls. They both were just \"OK\" nothing to write home about!!     Then followed up with #34..42...49.. I know sounds like a lot of food, which it was, we took some for left overs. My boyfriend and I shared The Pho (#34) and  with a touch of 'Sriacha\" (my favorite Chili hot sauce) it was delicious, I would definitely come back and order that again in a heart beat!   My dish was the #49 It was good,. It had great proportions of meat and noodles,  yet it was missing something.. I don't know what it was, it  just wasn't satisfying my 'Foodie' palate.. don't get me wrong it was good, I\"m sure others would like it...But......Well,  Lets put it this way,  My \"Foodie\" radar wasn't going into over drive. lol.   My boyfriends # 42, he though was 'OK' he wasnt a huge fan, but enjoyed it.   We  have a little tradition between him and I, the second we get into the car, we  rate the \"OVER ALL\" experiance (Food, Prices, Customer Serivce, Ect).. We both agreed on a 7 out of 10  The great thing about this restaurant is the prices. With ordering half the damn restaurant. lol.. our bill was only $32. so we cant complain, we did get a lot of food, for our buck.  I can tell you I will eat their again, Yet I wont be trying to run anyone over to get their! :)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the past and it was really good until I came back and it turned out that they had a new management and new people working here.  First of all, the new people working here was rude and gives a little of attitude almost everytime they hand our food over to us.  Secondly, we order a roll, seems like that roll was not even fresh. We barely touch the roll and the roll fall apart and had to request a new one Thirdly, I ordered the soup, the soup was a bit blend now not wat it used too. The flavor wasn't there anymore and my bf ordered the pork chop n stuff omg the meet was not fresh and tasted like I was chowing rubber. And also my brother in law ordered a chicken curry and the worse part was there was plenty of curry but not chicken to be found. Like really?!?! And when we complained about it they come out with the new order in less than 2 mins when we waited for almost an hour on our order and constantly asking for our food is ready or not coz they seem to keep  forgetting our food out. Lastly, we order a boba I love boba but for some reason I really hate there boba. One of the worse boba places I've tasted. The boba they use was so tasteless.  I would never recommend this place to anyone anymore. It's not the same anymore  :(  This new management thing was a bad idea."}
{"text":"had the spring roll and grilled pork vermicelli while my friend had pho. it was ok, but not the best I've had. the noodles were too soft for my taste and the spring roll wasn't that great."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! My boyfriend and I go all the time and I recently got my dad and sisters to go with me as well and they also liked it. Even my VERY picky 11 year old sister was asking to go again soon. (she gets the crabmeat soup) I usually get either the build your own pho (with brisket and flank) or the crabmeat soup. Their spring rolls are really good too! Everyone loves the \"snow\" and if you order the XL size to share they bring you this enormous pile of it! The prices are very reasonable and the portions are generous. On top of that the staff is very friendly and accomodating. This only thing I don't like are the boba drinks which are, for me, too sweet and the boba in mine was mushy. Though that may have just been an \"off\" day for that. When I told the waiter I couldn't drink it he graciously took it off the bill. Overall a really great restaurant and I most certainly recommend giving it a try! (:"}
{"text":"As a Vietnamese restaurant in Arizona, this place rocks.  I've lived in San Diego and Los Angeles and have had my share of REALLY GOOD pho, so I think I sorta know what I'm talking about.  Sometimes the meat in the pho is not as good, but overall good quality.  Broken rice dishes and vermicelli are good as well."}
{"text":"I've never had pho before, so i can't compare this place to anywhere else (hence only 4 stars), but i thoroughly enjoyed my food. For the record i ordered the meatball and shrimp pho.  if i had anything to do over, i would have ordered more spring rolls.  they were fantastic!  We went on Saturday for dinner and it was relatively slow.  The service was at a perfect pace and friendly.   it will definitely be a common stop."}
{"text":"Grant that I am even less expert in Viet cuisine than many others, but I know what I like and what's good to me. Based on the limited universe of Vietnamese restaurants I've tried, Pho Avina is the best, and has been so consistently.     Despite an enviably consistent business, the dining area is always clean but for any tables just vacated.  The food has been consistently excellent, the portions adequate or better, the presentation/appearance appealing,  the service always decent or better and the prices remarkable in a totally positive way.  An added bonus is the extensive boba drink menu, and the addition of a remarkable variety of Taiwanese shaved ice dessert combinations, always artfully presented.  These aren't the snow-cones most of us grew up with, and at about $4 and up, they should be something special, and though they may be old news to Taiwanese  and west coast Asian folk, it's a new-to-me delight in beautiful, ultra-light, cold dessert that I highly recommend.   If it's a little less appealing as AZ veers in and out of what passes for cold weather, have a hot pho first, and enjoy.  I don't think you can go wrong with either."}
{"text":"Great selection of vietnamese noodle soups. Especially try the oxtail soup if available.  Rice combo platters are also available if you want although not as tasty. Here you can also buy different bobas and/or snow cones.  Con: Place can be busy during the weekends so seating for larger groups can be hard.  There is only one bathroom for each gender with no baby changer. The bathroom regardless is kept clean everytime I go there."}
{"text":"I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try. also try the Boba I think it is the best I have had but I have had it at only one other place. The staff is friendly and everything is pretty quick to order. no complaints so far."}
{"text":"I like this Vietnamese restaurant. The food is always good and the prices very reasonable. The wait staff is quite nice, nicer than most asian food places. It's close to my work so I come here to eat quite often! I really like their smoothie too! However, they don't let people eat in half hour before closing, which is quite annoying because sometimes I like to sit down and eat after I get off work and I can't!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming and I really enjoyed the Pho. It was great. The soup was good and the chicken was good!"}
{"text":"I love Pho Avina! It's close to where I live, and the prices are great compared to some of the other ones I've been too. The food of course, is great as well!  I usually get the rice noodles with beef meatballs...I love to add all the bean sprouts and sriracha to it! Mmmm so good!!! Their springs rolls are good too! I don't really like the mint leaves in there, but everything else is good enough for me to get it again.   The fried rice is supppper good! I've tried it without meat and with chicken, and something about the spice makes it sooooo delicious!   I've tried the boba there and I would say it's alright. Some other places nearby make better boba in my opinion.   Service isn't great but they are very quick! Perfect to go when I'm ready to eat! I would definitely go more if I knew of another Pho lover.."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and the service was non existent and oblivious. Will have to try a new place - couldn't come back here even for free. I will leave it at that."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. When I lived over here I would go here constantly, like every week. It's very small and the service isn't the fastest, but the people barely speak English, so I'm not complaining too much.  It's definitely a legit Vietnamese place. The menu is huge! My favorite item is the rolls. They bring out a forest of garnishes - mint leaves, bean sprouts, carrots, etc. I always get the spicy pork. It's got nuts and chili flakes on it. Yum! They bring out the moist rice paper and away you go! The absolute best part is their peanut sauce. It's to die for. I asked for the recipe once and the little old lady (the owner) just laughed and shook her head and said, \"haha no no...no.\" She reminded me of Superman's Hispanic maid on Family Guy.  Only con is their awful bathroom set up where you have to wait until the cooks are ready for you to walk back there. Kind of annoying. And they also can't accept credit cards for less than a $10 charge."}
{"text":"I've been to Pho Avina three times already, and each time it's progressively worse.  Especially as I start tasting other Vietnamese restaurants around the valley.  I ordered just a regular pho with beef shanks, and spring rolls.  Both of the dishes were very mediocre.  Lets start with the side vegetable dish they give you; I barely got anything.  Just a small clump of bean sprouts, a small twig of basil, a lime, and that's pretty much it.  It's just not enough for one person.  The beef broth tasted odd to me as well.  It does not taste like 2 year old continuously boiled broth, and there is a strange tang to it.  It might appease some others though.  The spring rolls was also disappointing.  There was two tiny shrimps and barely any peanut sauce!.  Three shrimp minimum is my rule for spring rolls.    Finally ordered a boba for kicks, and all I have to say for that is yuck.  I couldn't even finish it.  It was too sweet, and milky.  It tasted like they just poured a can of condensed milk into the tea and called it a day.  Their Three Colored Drink was equally bad.  The red bean was hard and undercooked.  Furthermore, there was barely any jelly in there!    The worst part?  It's pretty expensive for pho, and isn't worth the price.  They're lucky they have a monopoly there especially with Pho 35 closing down.  Place Pho Avina in a city with tons of Vietnamese restaurants and it'll go the way of the dodo."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food. Very flavorful and a good atmosphere. Andy was very attentive and personable. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for pho in the area!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I usually get Spring rolls hmmm very delicious with the peanut sauce, you gotta try it.!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a pho restaurant i recommend going somewhere else, their pho is a little overpriced compared to others. I mean come on, 8 dollars for a combination entree? Theres more out there you can go to and would serve the same amount for 2 dollars cheaper and for the price here at pho avina, you can get extra noodles or other items. Other than that, the food came fast and the servuce is good. I would honestly go somewhere else though for a better price and dare i say...better quality."}
{"text":"Great service. The Pho was amazing and the Spring Rolls-OMG AWESOME!!!! This is my new Pho place. I love it."}
{"text":"Pho Avina is a lovely casual little place for excellent Vietnamese food.  The food is fresh, and delightful.  The menu is extensive and has all the traditional Vietnamese dishes I expected.   In addition to Pho, they serve other noodle (rice noodle and saigon noodle) and rice dishes as well as appetizers and salads. Under no circumstances would I compare it to Cyclo.  Cyclo is not a traditional Vietnamese restaurant... Pho Avina is.  I would compare the variety and quality to Saigon Pho on Alma school, which is one of my favorite restaurants.  They also have a nice selection of boba drinks.  I had a coconut one this time. I have had Avocado, Coffee, and mango as well.  So far, coconut is my favorite.  I think next time I will try taro.  mmmmm.... so good. I was so enamored with this place that I expect to stop there on the way home from work at least once every week or 2.  I need to add this note now..... since I first reviewed this place, it has become a real favorite of mine.  I stop here at least 1 or 2 times a week, and when I do, I often run into friends who learned about the place from me.  I'm headed there for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"I never liked Pho until my boyfriend had me try Pho Avina's Chicken Soup (#21). I officially fell in love with it!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese in the area, hands down. If you want authentic Vietnamese food this is the place. If you want cool decor and a hip vibe, keep searching."}
{"text":"Their Chicken Pho was Delicious and I love their vegetable spring rolls. Service was great, portions were huge. Place is very clean we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Their pho is excellent but I don't recommend this place. Service is extremely slow and they fail to check up on their customers. I noticed that Asian people are greeted right away here, they are served quickly and the staff is overly friendly with them.. I'm not the only one that feels this way! I took my family and friends here a few times and everyone agreed and noticed that Asian people get better treatment than whites here. This happened to me every time I dined here so it wasn't just a one time thing either."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, bad food, we order pho chicken for the little kids and we got a huge bowl, there is no favor at all. It was straight out of a chicken broth can. I order the crabmeat noodle soup. There wasn't nothing favor it was more topping in it then nothing. And my husband order grill beef; he said it wasn't bad. Never coming here again. I had better places then this."}
{"text":"Sweet baby Joseph, that is what I call Pho...  Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious Pho! . First time I had oxtail Pho ( Vietnamese noodle soup )t was delicious. They also have Vietnamese sandwiches, bubble shakes, shaved snow for dessert with fresh fruit. Very clean and very friendly. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is relatively good but the wait staff makes it not worth it. I've been here quite a few times and they've always been rude, but honestly tonight I got to the point where I just won't eat there anymore. We came when they were busy, which I understand, but it took a ridiculous amount of time to seat us. Then they brought out waters and promptly forgot about us. For 30 minutes. Took making eye contact to get some help, and once we did it was snappy help. The food came out quickly but then once I went to pay (at this point we waited so long we were the last people there and they were mopping the floors... Couldn't that wait until we left so we don't slip and fall?) the woman behind the counter was totaling the receipts for the day in the register and didn't acknowledge me. No \"I'll be right with you\" or \"just one second\" she just straight up did not acknowledge my presence. So I left the exact amount in cash and got the heck out of there. I will never go back. I'm not going to come waste my hard earned money on rude service. I'll find someone with better food and a better attitude."}
{"text":"Ordered a small beef pho...huge! Broth was great, not greasy and very flavorful.  Finally a place that serves avocado boba.  Although food was great, if you use the restroom it will make you lose your appetite, hence the 4-star rating."}
{"text":"I've always liked the food here at Pho Avina, notably the various meats and fried rice. Their Thai tea with boba isn't the best I've had, but still decent. I'm not a pho/soup kind of guy, but am told that it's also good. Their fusion foods, such as the egg rolls and wontons are passable.  Service has a tendency to go downhill when the place gets busy. On our most recent visit, my girlfriend's dinner was brought out, while mine was not. She had two choices: eat her food in front of me or let it get cold. It took them 20 minutes just to bring mine out after we finally said something. I can't figure out if this is just the result of bad service or if it's just some kind of cultural difference, as it's not the first time it's happened at a Vietnamese restaurant.  If you want dessert, 90% of the time, they never ask you, so you either have to go to the snoh bar and pay for it separately (and hope no one steals your seat), or tell them when they bring you the bill that you'd like to add snoh to it. The whole system, or lack thereof, is just very disorganized.  The reason why I often overlook all of these annoyances is because their snoh is some of the best that we've found! Its creamy texture is absolutely perfect, as opposed to most places that end up with too much ice. The coconut flavored snoh with chocolate drizzle and bananas is one of my personal favorites.  Overall, I feel it's a very nice little restaurant that just runs in a highly disorganized manner. Have a little patience and you'll probably enjoy it in the end."}
{"text":"I love their snoh, I've had every flavor and just about all the toppings. I highly recommend the Taro, with banana, strawberry mochi, and condensed milk on top."}
{"text":"Let me start with the best part of the experience. The coconut snow with strawberries and chocolate drizzle was absolutely to die for! I would make the trip to this restaurant just to eat that again!!      In all fairness, they were quite busy and our waitress was brand-new. However, we did have some very long wait times both for dinner and for the dessert.  The food was very tasty, the servers were pleasant and concerned and the prices are very reasonable.  The restaurant was clean and they really acted like they were glad you were there!    We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me, but I don't like the kids serving the food.  I love Avina's. About 5 years ago, my dad and I used to come here two times a week for Vietnamese food.  It was so good! I remember coming to their restaurant before they even moved to this plaza. I know when it was Avina and just her daughter working the place. The food never faltered. I also remember seeing a family who had called ahead for dinner and she had all the dishes they wanted, done and served as soon as they sat down. I mean that was just awesome for this small whole in the wall place.  Now, I'm not so sure anymore. I do know after I have come back I have only had one visit to Avina's. I had Canh Chua with shrimp.  It was delicious as I remember but a tad too sweet. I had a Vietnamese iced coffee. It was a bit watery. It still gets the 5-stars because I love Avina and her daughter. The place serves good food for a good price. I miss the TV only having Vietnamese shows.   Dishes that I remember eating here that are always good:  Pho Tai Canh Chua  with Shrimp Vietnamese pork chops over rice Vietnamese beef stew with slices of baguette Spring Rolls Egg Rolls Vietnamese Pancake Vietnamese Ice Coffee  This is my general list of what has to be good at a Vietnamese restaurant. It's not just a Pho shop and it's definitely not a Banh Mi shop."}
{"text":"A trip to Pho Avina is a trip worth forgetting about. Swung by this joint for a Saturday lunch, the place was packed, with a schmeezly one server for +10 tables.   Questionable spring rolls with peanut sauce uncomfortably light brown and milky..luke warm broth in my bowl of pho (should be piping!)... and flagging down the server to order, to get water, to get a check, to get back a check was NOT cool at all.   Yes, I may be critical because of my Southern California descent, but I know it doesn't take a rocket scientist to make a decent spring roll or hire more servers when clearly needed. X-NAY!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly staff. All choices have lots of info on ingredients and how they are cooked. Food came out quickly (within 5 min). Had the Pho in the lunch portion and it was still too much. Ordered the Sriracha chicken as a backup. Also very tasty. Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is this place could only feed children, the portions are for 5 year olds. I just got so upset when I got my food, I didn't even want to eat it. The taste of the food is okay, but there is really no point in eating at a restaurant that cannot even remotely fill you up."}
{"text":"This is the worst pho restaurant I have been to since a new owners took over, first the waitress gave me the wrong order , got home & called them, waitress was apologetic but instead of saying \" ok we will replace it when can you come by, she said oh bring that back we will give you the correct order, wow she thinks I live across the street then I argued finally she said come by tomorrow & will replace it & then today I came back for the order but wow they put 1 1/2 shrimp & the hard part of the vegetables & the wrapper was all broken & the food just fell apart! Very bad restaurant & would never go back to this one! Rating is 0 Food is horrible"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, and never order take out from here. Pho Avina used to be my \"go-to\" for viet cuisine a few years back. Having left AZ a few years back, i visted recently and decided to place an order there and introduce some friends and family to the traditionally accoladed \"pho.\" At 3:45 on a tuesday afternoon I ordered 4 pho ga (rice noodle soup with chicken) and an order of spring rolls on the side. No problem taking the order, they ask me to pick up in a half hour.  I arrive half an hour later -as directed, pay my bill, and pick up my order. As I'm getting settled in my car, I have the sudden inclination to check my order.  Opening each hermetically sealed container they've provided me, I realize I am short an entire order of pho. I turn off the car, make my way in, and inquire about the missing pho. They say, \"no problem\" and apologize. I wait another ten minutes to procure the missing soup and its  botanical accoutrements.  Ok, \"no problem.\"  I'm a bit perturbed by the situation, but I'm also a realist; this kinda thing happens! So I return home from my half hour drive, eager to present the pho and spring rolls to my viet cuisine newbies.  Low and behold, the noodles for all 4 pho orders are crispy, dry, and unsoaked.  FAIL. Somebody missed a vital step in the prep process.  For $50 I expect my noodles prepped accordingly. No happy ending here...no moist noodle for me."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight for the first time and I'm really happy to report that their vegetarian options are plentiful and excellent.  Had the spring rolls, the vermicelli salad, a curried pho, an excellent fruit dessert, and a simple tofu and noodle pho for my son.    update...I've now been several times, and my only complaint is that the food is a bit inconsistent.  It's never bad, and that's a good thing, but sometimes the curried soup is the best ever, and sometimes it's just okay.  Will I stop going here?  No!  Would I recommend it?  Absolutely.  But I would like to see the dishes be a bit more consistent...that's all."}
{"text":"Pho Avina has some of the best snow in Phoenix! You wouldn't guess since there isn't any advertising but I highly recommend coming to give this place a chance! They have unique flavors and fresh toppings for their snow that other places in the greater phoenix area do not. The staff is bubbly and very sweet. Come here for snow, you won't regret it !!"}
{"text":"Place is great. Never had something that wasn't beyond tasty. Boba is always on point (if you've ever had a bad Boba experience you will appreciate this), snow was awesome and they are super courteous if an error is made."}
{"text":"I love their snow!! it's fluffy, tasty and beautiful! Glad they are in the west side!!"}
{"text":"First time eating Vietnamese food. Tried the Pho Ga, noodle broth with chicken soup. Flavor did not appeal to me, somewhat sweet and different, not salty like a chicken broth. Served with a  plate of basil, cilantro, greens to add to the broth. Slices of chicken in the soup were dry. Vegetarian spring rolls were tasty but heavily deep fried. Best of all was the coconut dessert with kiwi slices, light and refreshing. Service was good.  I do not plan to try this cuisine again. Had a similar experience with Thai cuisine. Just not for me."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Pho Avina since day one of trying their restaurant. I was craving some pho and boba when i came upon their review on yelp. So my sibling and i decided to give it a go.. And we loved it!  The soup was delicious! The garnishes were fresh and superb! Noodles were amazing and not too soft or hard. The place is a good size but is always busy! The restrooms are better than most vietnamese places I've dined at. The atmosphere is clean and customer service is good for the most part.  I love their bobas and popping pearls!! Yay However, lately there has been strange people trying to ask for money in the parking lot. I don't feel threatened, but these days you can never be too cautious."}
{"text":"This place makes good Pho and rice dishes. They offer hugh bowls for noodle soup. Their bun rieu is not so good. It's okay. I don't really like tomatoes cut into big slices. I prefer them really cooked."}
{"text":"Meh, this place is weak. Went here last week for a late lunch with a buddy who works in the area. I have eaten at several Pho stops around town (check my reviews) and this has got to be my least favority of the bunch so far.   Started with the egg rolls which were just deep friend and essentially flavorless. Ordered up our Pho Tai, and there was little meat to speak of. I mean, my homeboy had four gigantic bites and was digging for additional beef to no avail. The broth in the Pho (a much overlooked aspect of Pho) was really not great and the noodles were just OK. We ordered up a limeade to go with our meal and it was super sugary and not that appealing. The only enjoyable part of the meal was the check, but cheap Pho is not hard to come by anyway so.....   I don't plan on coming back to Avina ever, especially when I've got Maxim closer to home...."}
{"text":"I've eaten Vietnamese food all over the valley and this place is by far my favorite. Particularly the BÚN BÒ HUE ~ Spicy Beef Soup.  It is hands-down the best version of this I have ever had. The broth is so flavorful I dream about it. It is incredibly complex and it's hard to pinpoint what flavors are in there, but you won't care, you'll be too busy eating the bathtub sized bowl of heaven.   Also amazing are the grilled meats, especially the shrimp. They have a delicious sauce on them and taste smokey from the grill. Awesome on the rice platter or in the \"roll your own\" spring rolls (a very light and healthy way to enjoy Vietnamese!)  Also of note are the rice flower crepe (allow a few extra minutes for this one if you are in a lunch rush) and the fantastic creamy curry (chicken, beef, shrimp or tofu). The entree comes with rice, BUT if you order it off the \"sandwich\" menu, you'll get a smaller portion (the regular is huge) surrounded by warm crusty french bread. To. Die. For. Not spicy but full of flavor and the creamy taste of coconut milk.  They can get pretty busy at times and occasionally the service is a bit slow, waiting to check out etc, but not always and it's worth the wait. Just ask for your check a little early and don't be afraid to flag down a server. They are all VERY friendly."}
{"text":"my daughter and nephew loved the oxtail soup and eggrolls, place is nice and service is good...they also have a variety of grilled plate than u can choose from and pork chop and grilled chicken are my favorite...taro boba and the shaved ice with varity of flavors and toppings to choose from is pretty awesome"}
{"text":"This place was ok. The pho isn't as great as I had expected from the reviews. They gave me a small plate of veggies and I had asked if I could have a little more. I was unknowingly was charged extra for it and the quantity of the extra dish wasn't worth asking for. Normally pho restaurants don't charge for meaningless side dishes, but I guess I should've tried their boba to make my experience more worthwhile."}
{"text":"This place okay.  Just okay.  Not the best, but far from the worst.  It's nthing fancy, nor even memorable.  Just good food, and good prices.  For a quicl meal, it's average.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"The BEST Pho broth ever! Their pho dac biet is the best with just enough to get you full and not over feed! Other places I may alter the taste with lime and chili paste but their broth allows you to enjoy the flavor they created with little to no alterations!   I LOVE Pho Avina!"}
{"text":"Really tasty Vietnamese food. The place is very clean and the service was great. I really enjoyed my lunch and for eight dollars including tip, the price can't be beat.  I had the pho with eye of round and it was flavorful, hot, and came with all of the expected herbs and toppings.  I can give this place a solid four stars very easily."}
{"text":"My spring rolls were nothing but noodles...super sad. This place really has changed over the years. This was my go-to spot for so long when I lived in CA and came here to Glendale to visit my family. Now I live here, was super excited to go to my crazy busy, super good spring roll place I remembered and when I walked in to what has always been a packed restaurant, I was the only one at dinner time, ordered to go and got spring noodle rolls, no greens, no fresh herbs, chincey on the pork...super bummed. On a trek to find a new Vietnamese place I guess :(  New management maybe???"}
{"text":"Pho Avina is \"OK\" at best. It is hard to give an accurate rating using a five star system. This place would rate a five on a scale from one to ten.   However, I'm not going to be too harsh just based on the principle that there aren't many options with ethnic foods in AZ so they earn a three for that alone.   I can't say the food isn't terrible, because it isn't, but it is definitely sub par from the Vietnamese that I am used to. I tried the rolls, pho and rice dishes from Avina.    Avina's fresh rolls were small, and as mentioned oddly sweet. The hoisin and peanut (that's \"seafood\" or \"from the sea\") sauce was also a strange pastel color rather than the dark purplish brown that it naturally comes in. Probably watered down.    Their fried rolls were also very plain. It was just pork in there. Not very Vietnamese/SE Asian if you ask me. What happened to pork, \"wood mushroom\" (I have no idea what the fuck it's called in English believe it or not), carrots, and \"phun see\"?    Pho is, for lack of a better term, the bread and butter of a Vietnamese place. Avina's pho was scant on meat, and the broth as noted by another commenter was oddly sweet (as a matter of fact, everything there that isn't supposed to be sweet was very sweet).   Another deal is this, every Vietnamese restaurant I've been to gives you size options when ordering pho. Size small for children and those who just want to dip their toes or watch their \"figures\" and size large and extra large for those who crave pho so much where one measly bowl just won't do. The herb plate that accompanied Avina's pho bowl was also on the scant side but I guess since the noodle bowl is small you don't need so many herbs and jalapenos to throw in there do you. Guess not.   The rice dish I tried was also a let down. Not on taste (other than the sweetness) mind you, but again, every rice dish I'm used to comes standard with a slab of egg cake and a small portion of a ground up pork, tripe, and peanut mixture, along with your pickled carrots, turnips, and cucumbers. The rice dish from Avina came with two cucumber slices, and a couple (and I do mean a couple) of other pickled vegetables. The pork chop was also small as hell. Weak.   Asian food (aside from sushi houses) isn't known for serving small portions!   To sum it up, Avina is pricey for the kind of food that it is, has small portions, and everything is oddly sweet when it isn't supposed to be."}
{"text":"This is our go to place after I pick up my wife from ASU West and we're both hungry.  I always order the chicken breast pho while my wife occasionally experiments with fried rice.  Their pho is great and tastes even better with some sriracha sauce (make a full red circle in your bowl) and hoisin sauce (make a smiley face).  If I'm really hungry, I can finish the entire bowl.  Usually I leave some soup and let them take it.  We're interested in trying their macarons since I've only tasted Napoleon Bakery (which is fabulous), but they didn't have any the last few times we've been there.  It probably doesn't help we usually stop in there during the week well after normal dinner time.  Pho always comes out quick if you're hungry and can't wait.  I've noticed their other dishes take more time.  I like how they make their broth from chicken stock since we don't eat beef.  I think one time they ran out and used vegetable broth.  It tasted okay, but chicken broth tastes much better.  It tastes healthy too.  You can't ask for much more when getting \"fast\" vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Was craving pho and pho is what we got! So glad that we went here. The food was delicious and the shrimp and pork rolls was bomb! The prices wasn't bad. We also didn't have to wait too long for our food. We ordered and it came out less than 20 min. My boyfriend didn't like the fact that they only had 1 size for the pho. And so I gave him some of my noodles.  We did arrive around 8ish which they closed at 9, so I expected to feel rushed which is understandable. Only complaint I would have...which didn't bother me much was that they forgot about my Thai tea, but luckily one of the servers went around asking us for any last call orders.   I would go back again just maybe not so late, so I don't feel rushed."}
{"text":"The food here is really yummy and the prices are very fair. If you show up before three I definitely recommend trying the sandwiches. The only reason for not giving five stars is because, like mentioned in other reviews, the wait staff can definitely be a crap shoot. I've had awesome,amazing attentive service and then other times the waiter isn't even listening nor bothers to write down my order then get upset when he brings the food and we tell him that's not what we ordered. No need to be rude to me cause you messed up. Trust me I'm more irritated than you are. Anyways, I'll be back cause the food is pretty good but just be forewarned."}
{"text":"Pho Avina has been one of my favorite restaurants over the last 5 years or so. More recently the service has been horrible. They are not organized when ensuring guests are being helped. I don't know if management has changed but since the staffing has changed they have not been very good. I've been very disappointed lately."}
{"text":"The food here would be rated better if they would take more care in the preparation of the noodles. They are overcooked. I was there with my boyfriend recently asnd specifically asked that they not be soggy and overcooked. STILL the noodles in my Bun were overcooked along with the noodles in my boyfriend's Pho. I realized that they have no intention of going to the trouble of preparing the noodles per order. They want to soak them in bulk to have them readily available for hours of orders. (This happens in fast food Italian restaurants too.)  No matter how good everything else is, the dish is ruined with soggy, overcooked noodles! It's so important that they be \"adente\". I complained to the owner and she shyly said nothing. She knows they are overcooked and has no intention of changing because it will be too inconvenient to cook them to order.   I'll never go back!  The best place in Phoenix is Da Vang on 19th Avenue between Indian School and Campbell."}
{"text":"Great food and fabulous service! Four of us went there for lunch last week and ordered one of the Pho soups. The \"regular\" bowl was so huge that we took the left overs home and had it for two more servings. The Pho was very tasty and hot.  I will be back often."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant in a somewhat boring strip mall.  Service was great and the decor was very fitting.  I liked the food, but didn't fall in love with it.  It could be my taste buds, I'm not sure.  However, during my visit there were many other patrons who appeared to be Vietnamese dining at the same time.  To me this is a good sign so if you're looking to try this place out I'd say give it a shot."}
{"text":"The ORIGINAL OWNERS just SOLD the place 1-2 months ago!!! It's under NEW OWNERSHIP and they are not Vietnamese. New waiters, new staff. You may still see the original owner there from time to time to help the new owners with the transition. You will also see some of the older waiters. They will be helping out for another 6 months to 1 year.  Been going here for over 2 years regularly. Loved getting the 'Bun Bo Hue' dish... I'm actually crazy about 'Bun Bo Hue'. My husband loved getting 'Pho Bo Vien' (Pho with meatballs). And we both loved the rice plates.   Ever since the new ownership, some of the food are not consistent and not as great. For instance, the 'Bun Bo Hue' tastes different.. still decent.. but not great... and just different overall. I used to think no one here in Phoenix can have superior 'Bun Bo Hue'... but I have finally found a place that does (restaurant is called \"PT Noodles\" in Avondale, AZ... rice is great there though... anyway... that's a different review). The Pho here is still good though!!  Some of the rice entrees have changed as well. Sometimes, the meat is prepared differently.  Never liked the Snow or boba here. They are stingy on the toppings. Go elsewhere for those products (I recommend \"Snoh Ice Shavery\" in central Phoenix)  The waiters need more training on how to be good waiters. Otherwise, they are actually really nice people."}
{"text":"My new favorite Vietnamese restaurant. There springs are amazing I like my veggies but they don't put unnecessary veggies. I can eat my spring roll without picking out what I don't like. There desert  is amazing I love the ice cream and it's up the street from me."}
{"text":"It may be busy, it may take a little time getting your food, but if you have a full hour for lunch or in the mood for dinner, it's never a bad choice. They have everything from Vietnamese sandwiches and soups to delicious smoothies and shaved ice with fresh toppings at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Fun desserts & drinks w Boba  (did I write that right?! ) Shaved ice a new try for me & loved it...You will too!"}
{"text":"Low key, casual, tucked away into a strip mall. I ordered the B3 with chicken. Taste wise, the chicken was really good. The pickled vegetables (all 4 slices of carrot) were a nice edge to the noodle salad bowl. They added that much needed crisp.   The fried spring roll my bowl came with was reaaallly tasty. I probably could've eaten a few more of those given the chance. Pretty sure they were pork spring rolls.  The noodles I felt were possibly overcooked. They broke apart completely during the mixing process and it really just ended up being mush, but thats not a huge deal breaker. The \"tangy fish sauce\" that was meant to accompany my bowl either never arrived, or it was the vinegar oil mixture they gave me in a plastic resealable container. Which had next to no taste. And it wasn't very fishy in flavor? So I guessed that wasn't it.  We also had to ask to order drinks. Because our waiter never asked us. Maybe this is typical for this type of place? I found it a tid bit odd. I didn't bother to ask for the fish sauce that was supposed to come with my meal cause I ended up using chili sauce as a substitute.   I cant really knock a place down for me trying something that really isn't their specialty. You know? I should've had pho instead. But I'm an asshole. Ill try that next time for sure.  My better half chose a fried noodle dish with chicken and beef. Noodles were over cooked, and he mentioned there wasn't much flavor. Again, they have pho in their name. Not \"noodle salad\".   We were still peckish, so we talked ourselves into some smoothies. Which...WERE AMAZING. My bearded bear man chose the coffee smoothie sans boba (he hates boba, he thinks its like boogers). I picked the Thai Tea smoothie with boba. I was nervous that they were going to be overly sweet with not much flavor but I was pleasantly surprised. The coffee smoothie tasted like great coffee. And my thai smoothie was perfect.   The main reason for the less than perfect rating (other than what I mentioned about the food and lack of drinks which were never refilled) was I noticed one of the servers sneezing/coughing constantly...while handling food..and cards..and drinks. If you're sick, stay home if you work in the food industry, otherwise you're a hazard.    Ill come back eventually, but next time Ill be a bit more cautious."}
{"text":"Im rating a 4 stars only because I did not have the opportunity to try the food. I had the opportunity to look over the menu and they seemed to have so many great selections. I will be returning! Anyways, I was in the area and noticed that they sold boba drinks and snow! I did not know there was any where else in the valley besides snoh in phoenix that sold it.   Unfortunately, my tummy was already full and I only ordered a mango fruit smoothie with boba. The boba was delicious made. However, the fruit smoothies are suppose to be made out of real fruit, that being said I believe my smoothie contained either mangos that were not rip yet or artificial flavors compared to the banana/strawberry smoothie my boyfriend got.   Overall, the staff was so attentive. We got greeted and had suggestions and our order taken right away.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great for lunch! I had the vegetarian soup. Loaded with lots of delicious vegetables and tofu. Yum!"}
{"text":"We weren't thrilled with this restaurant. The spring rolls were bland and the peanut sauce was watery. I thought the actual pho was decent. My friends remarked that there weren't enough noodles in the bowl, but I thought the portion size was okay. We also tried the Thai tea. It was too sweet, but not bad. Overall, we probably wouldn't come back, but it wasn't awful either."}
{"text":"Awesome Customer Service!!  First time trying pho, for my taste buds it was okay.  BUT what got me hooked and I will for sure be coming back is their shaved ice.  OMG!!!! Fucking Amazing. I expected artificial flavor, but it was so natural tasting, and so refreshing. YUM!!  Yes I'm a little ecstatic. must try.."}
{"text":"I really like this place !!! The taste is good but I like people there. The servers look like they are brothers but all are very quiet but kind and don't bother you with over kindness. And their boba tea is the best in town !!!!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed in this place.  It use to be one of my favorites, but seems like it kinda gone downhill. The service wasn't as friendly as it use to be.  The Pho seems so skimpy.  I order a combination Pho, it's usually packed with meats but it only had 2 small slice of round steak,  2 small slice of brisket,  a tenth of a meatball... what the heck happened? Felt really disappointed.  On a good note,  the dessert was good.  They do really well with that. All in all i do like the place, just disappointed for today."}
{"text":"First time here and it was delicious!! So happy to find a great pho place on the west side of town. The service was great and our food came out insanely fast. The veggie pho was filled to the top with veggies and was in a vegetable broth. Out of all the pho restaurants we've visited, I think we like their rice noodles the best...they were cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Rude and clueless staff. They were out of multiple appetizers one hour after opening. They had three servers running around and all of them were struggling even though the place was 1/3 full. We tried to order snow after and the waitress didn't know what to say and mumbled that they were too busy, then later said we should wait. When we asked for how long, she just laughed and didn't answer us. Other servers were either rude whenever we asked them for something, or just plain clueless."}
{"text":"The only good thing about Pho Avina is the fact that it's clean. Besides that everything falls a bit short; in terms of service and food.  Came in looking for a new Vietnamese spot to try and to curb our Vietnamese cuisine and boba/snow craving.  The restaurant is clean and spacious, not too many people were dining at the time of arrival but quickly filled up. I ordered the Clear Rice Noodles with soup on the side (Hu Tieu Saigon). It's a noodle dish that comes with bean sprouts, onions, clear rice noodles, slices of bbq pork, pieces of imitation crab, shrimp and chives. The noodles are tossed in a sweet soy and comes with a side of broth (chicken). The dish was lacking in flavor and portion. Even with chili sauce and a spritz of lemon, the dish was lackluster and just had a sweetness to it. It was 35% onion and bean sprouts. Totally not a satisfying nor did it taste close to what Hu Tieu Saigon should taste like. We were given a plate of veggies and the cilantro was wilted and the plate looked limp as if sitting out for past it's prime.  The service was a bit spotty, it was good at first and kind of awkward. A few customers ended up leaving because they weren't being helped though there was a good amount of staff available. At this point I didn't order boba/snow dessert because I didn't think the food or service was good.  Price is decent if you're looking for a mediocre bowl of noodles and slow service, but you can get better quality Vietnamese food elsewhere. The only thing going for this place is it's clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am in love! It's been a long time since I have had Vietnamese food. Years ago my favorite, regular spot was the old Avina's at 43rd Ave and Bell Road. Then the owners changed or something and their Pho broth changed and was really pretty gross, and I lost my taste for Pho after so many years of craving it. I read the reviews on Yelp and thought I would give it a try again because I had a cold and was craving the rich, flavorful broth that I remembered.  I went on a Saturday with my boyfriend who had never had Vietnamese food. We walked in and I was immediately impressed with the clean, welcoming atmosphere. They were pretty busy, but we were seated and our drink order was taken right away.   We ordered a Shrimp soup with Won Ton and egg noodles, egg rolls, spring rolls and the fried sweet potato with pineapple, along with a combo noodle dish with beef and chicken. Wow, wow wow!  We got our food quickly and everything looked amazing. The herbs that came with the soup were super fresh, and the broth was complex, so rich and full of flavor, without a hint of greasiness. Everything we ordered was amazing. The Pho broth tasted exactly the same as the original Avina's recipe that I remembered.   I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. The servers were attentive to us right off the bat. We ordered pho. It was so good and so fresh."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. Genuinely kind. Amazing food, and they even have yummy desserts. It's a gem."}
{"text":"Pho with pork and shrimp is delish!! The pork egg rolls were delish as well , my niece is a picky eater but she devoured those egg rolls!!"}
{"text":"The Good: The food is flavorful, fresh, and the menu contains a LOT of options. I've taken several different groups of friends here and no one has come away unhappy thus far.  The Bad: The worst I can say is that a few of the wait staff aren't as on the ball as other members of the staff. I've had both attentive service and so-so service here. Definitely good enough to keep coming back, but occasionally a crap-shoot.  Overall: While not a place for elegant dining, no one comes here looking for that. The food is delicious and the prices are absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and you can end a great meal with some delicious shaved ice. Mango strawberry with condensed milk."}
{"text":"Being Vietnamese, it's not too often I got out for Vietnamese food. It's very hard to find a place that could compare to our homemade dishes. Although after trying Pho Avina, I can say I love this place! I discovered it because it is right across from ASU West campus, and I got out class early one day and had a mad craving for pho! I remembered seeing the sign as I printed off some work at the local FedEx. I decided that I was going to give them a try. NO REGRETS. The food is great and the service is exceptional. Walking in, they greet and seat you immediately and excitedly. It's a very quick and casual setting. They take orders quickly and bring out the orders quite promptly, perfect for tight school schedules. The first time I came I had the chicken pho and spring rolls. YUM. I really like how they added ground garlic to the chicken pho. When  I ordered spring rolls, the waitress asked if I would like the grilled pork, I said \"sure why not\". Traditionally it's usually just a boiled pork, but I must say, I am loving the grilled pork in my spring roll, add so much more flavor! I enjoy how there's a little bit of a personalized chef's touch to their food. Even though different, the chef pairs it so well! Since then, I've also tried their egg rolls and steak and meatball pho, which was also very enjoyable. So far, I'm really liking this place, they've got great food, service, and recommendations. -1 star because the pricing it a bit high for a pho shop, but I don't think I see that stopping my from coming back. I can't wait to try all the other dishes here!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and every time I've received great service. One time my food was served cold, and the friendly folks re-made the plate fresh and hot. The pho is excellent. I've tried pho around the valley and this is definitely one of the better places. The boba here is also pretty good. Family friendly, great service and great food."}
{"text":"Skip the fresh spring rolls. Barely anything inside with 90% noodles. Watery peanut sauce. taro boba flavor good but boba soggy. Black moldy bean sprouts in the pho. Broth flavor was slightly sweet and savory"}
{"text":"I like to have a bite some times at this small place. I m not a big fan of pho, but I do like their noodle dishes. Sizes r huge, a lunch portion is enough for me to have a dinner and some big leftovers for my lunch for next day. They do have few vegetarian options and they do have tofu pho with vegetable broth. Boba is one of the best one. And they did made mine with soy milk ( I m allergic to any milk products- never had any problems after eating at Avina)  People r very nice there. Definitely gonna continue to coming for my noodles and would recommend."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since I came to Arizona 6 years ago. The foods (Pho, rice plates, and almost everything else) are quite good. I learn to go in small groups (3-4 max) and not more than 10. The staff informed me that they can't split the bill individually if there are more than 10 people. Otherwise the foods are great!"}
{"text":"Very nice clean and sparkling.  Waiter was excellent.  Food was amazing.  Nice and spicy seafood pho.  Very authentic.  Quite busy but no wait."}
{"text":"Good Pho. Haven't tried too many other Pho restaurants in the Phoenix area yet, but this is pretty comparable to good Pho I have had elsewhere. The atmosphere is pretty interesting. There was some Vietnamese talent show on TV which was more than entertaining. The service was great. Very nice and attentive. The price was fair. From what I recall, it was about $9 for a bowl of Pho."}
{"text":"This place is my best friend favorite place.. I was kind of ehhhh about it because I know where good vietnamese food is at. Haha. Anyways good vegetarian options for me. Yes. Score. Very helpful and very accommodating.   Their vegetarian vermicelli was wonderful but next time I have to tell them easy on the garlic. Overall everything went smoothly :)"}
{"text":"I love Pho and decided to try this place on the West side (since it is relatively close to my work).  It was clean and the service was quick and painless.  The Pho was good but not great.  I am a huge fan of Noodles Ranch in Old Town Scottsdale and Pho Avina simply does not measure up in terms of their Pho.  However, I very much enjoyed their vegetarian eggrolls which were very hot, not too greasy and had excellent flavor.  I will go back to try other items on the menu as they are very reasonably priced and their service is quick."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant on the west side of town.  I travel frequently to LA, San Fran, Seattle for work, so I appreciate the great Vietnamese places there. But this place has the best pho in Phoenix on this side of town, and for reasonable prices.  I don't go as often any more because of my new focus on healthy clean food, but this place is still my place to go whenever I crave pho."}
{"text":"Not only was the staff fun and friendly but the food was absolutely amazing! I love Pho and have tried many places since I moved to Arizona six years ago. I can honestly say none has compared to this! I will be going back again and again!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good with the old owners now it's just ok. Having lunch and the guy next to me cutting his toe nails and employees saw him and not saying anything to him. Well that killed my appetite. No more coming to this place"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this place but I've been here a few times with my Vietnamese friends... so I don't know, maybe I'm missing something? The flavor of the broth is okay, they give you a lot of meat, but I hate how quickly the noodles get soft. I like my noodles a little more al dente.  I don't like the smoothies and milk teas here either, they taste like the powdered kind, and the boba/tapioca balls are always too squishy like they've been sitting in the water for too long (starting to notice a pattern?) The Banh Xeo was good here though, pretty big serving good for sharing. I would not recommend this place, there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time 11/13/15 for dinner.  I had the pepper chicken dinner, and it was very good.  It was as spicy as it can get, before a plate is uneatable.  Service was prompt, and courteous, and the place was clean.  If there were an issue they can work on is for the servers to talk more.  They are strictly business...not in a rude way, but definitely no small talk, or willingness to give suggestions for food.  But since I was with company this was not much of an issue."}
{"text":"Gonna keep this simple. We went back 2 days in a row and then again. The chicken pho is amazing(I get the level 10 spicy and request the unimaginable level 50 if it existed because I love fire and was told I was the second person they've seen finish it and down the broth completely in under 20 min lol.) this place is worth the try. And grab a coconut boba at the end too."}
{"text":"This is my second time getting carryout from here and both times have been nothing but positive. Food is always hot fresh and delicious when I arrive, the portions are huge, and it's reasonably priced. There are a lot of pho places popping up but this place has a delicious broth that is soul soothing. Family-run place with lots of parking"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since it was  at the old location. It's exactly what a small ethnic eatery should be. Great food, great service, low prices.   The folks who run this place really care about their customers and are always friendly.   Whenever I go to a Vietnamese restaurant I always order the Pho and this is good. The Pho Ga is fresh and tasty. The fragrant broth, cilantro, basil and tangy sauce can really get addictive. It's great for lunch or a quick dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place affordable pho tasty but pricy boba. Now they have a dinner option in the pho. I feel the dinner option is too much when we eat there. However, they only off the dinner option to go and it it more if a regular size."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Love their BUN BO HUE Not many Viet restaurant offer this dish Plenty of choices too They also have sandwiches and boba Been coming here for 7 years!"}
{"text":"A good pho is hard to find... you can get one here! The lunch-time banh mi is spot on as well. Also, give the snow a try. It's like ice cream cotton candy! We come here a lot and it's always good. And get the durian boba! Just do it!"}
{"text":"Pho Avina is good place to get pho, bobas, and banh mi. Came in around 7 pm to get couple of sandwiches Togo for next day, but found out they stop making banh mi at 3 pm. I will have to remember that next time. So we decided on pork chop rice plate and honey dew boba. The rice plate was exactly what I expected. The meat had lots of seasoning and very tender. The boba was really good. Perfect sweetness and chewiness of bobas.  Would love to return to try their banh mi!"}
{"text":"New owner. Avina sold it to relatives.  Menu has so far stayed the same which I like.  They are adding new menu items I think.  Prices went up a week or two ago.  Slushies are delicious.  Food is great. Pho comes out fast. Veggie Pho takes longer because less veggie broth is made and is made fresh I think.  Combination plates take longer."}
{"text":"Love this place compared to Davang's and Little Saigon. My personal fave is the grilled chicken and their pork egg roll. Their oxtail soup is very tasty as well. They also have desserts to choose from...love the taro shave ice with wafer stick and banana. The price is affordable as well. Overall, it is a good place to go to if you are craving for some pho."}
{"text":"Open until 9:30 many nights. This is a plus for us late eaters. But the Snow desert closes at 9:00. So order it before 9:00. It may melt, but you simply do not want to miss it. I will eat desert first next time rather than miss it.   The pork chop is the best I have had anywhere and in any cuisine. The Pho is savory and memorable. They have cilantro. They have a wide variety of such soups. I had the mixed vegetable and meats in the bowl made out of crunchy noodles. It was huge with lots of beef, chicken and shrimp. It is served very vey hot, almost boiling hot. This kind of cooks the crunchy noodles but leaves them still crunchy. Don't burn your lips you will want to chow down on it. I am thinking of getting strawberry everything snow and munching bites of it between bites of the crunchy noodle bowl dish next time.  The noodle bowl combo is 12.00 and the pork chop 8.00. Our waiter recommended these two items as among his favorites. He was so seriously excited about these two items he forgot to give us the heads up on the \"Snow\" closing at 9:00.  You do not want to miss the \"snow\""}
{"text":"I like pho. Don't love it like my kids do. Yet I must admit that this place serves good food. Hearty portions...and more important, they use fresh ingredients. I may consider going back to try some more of their offerings. Huge menu with so many options. I came on a Thursday around 3pm and it was somewhat busy. I ordered the Bò Viên (meatballs) pho. Good choice. My meal was pretty darn good. The only reason I didn't give more stars is because once my server dropped off my food (with bill), I didn't see her again. As a paying customer, there's no excuse for that. Especially when I see her sitting 2 tables away, texting on her phone and eating her own bowl of delicious pho."}
{"text":"Great place for your lunch. Their staff members are so friendly. They show me how to pick up the right type of food that I would want. Their Thai Tea might be one of the best tea that I've tried so far in Phoenix. I'll be back again for sure! Definitely recommend this place to my friends and my family!"}
{"text":"How does a big hot steamy bowl of awesomeness sound?  If it sounds great to you, you need to hit this place up, it is fantastic.  My wife and I have been here more then just a few places and every time it is great.  I don't know how many times a week my wife is craving some of their pho.  This place definitely has a lot more to offer then just pho.  Between my wife and I, we have probably tried all the pho's on the menu.  The chicken and the beef are always are go to soups.  If you are feeling a little adventurous there are some more exotic meats you can try in your soup though, too.  Last time I was there I tried one of their other soups, it was a spicey beef soup.  It normal comes with the tendons, but I went ahead and skipped those this time.  it was fantastic.  It wasn't the usual rice noodles that you get in pho, which was a great change.  It was a giant spicey bowl of deliciousness.  While we haven't got much here other than soup, we have tried some of the appetizers and some of the Bánh mìs.  They were good also.  The Bánh mìs are pretty tasty.  Some are better than others, for my taste. If you go you'll just have to try a couple and see which ones you like best.  Don't worry, it will be enjoyable.    With all these praises, you may be asking why I'm only giving it four stars.  That would be a good question indeed.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is the quality of the meat.  From time to time, some of the meat is little bit fattier and a little bit more grisly then I would like.  I understand that this meat selection is a huge part of what makes the broth taste so amazing, but It's my only real complaint about this place."}
{"text":"This is the best place for Vietnamese food hands down,I get happy just walking in the place..I love it!!! I have to give it five stars. Durian bob a is breathtaking(once you get over the smell) Lol!!"}
{"text":"I come here at least a few times a month. If you enjoy Pho, you don't want to miss this place. If you've never had Pho, you don't want to miss this place. Eat here."}
{"text":"Their Boba is bomb! Always great quality Boba which has been surprisingly hard to find in AZ. But theirs is good. I used to think their Pho was super great but after trying out other restaurants I've realized their Pho is ok. Not great not bad. It's the quality of their noodle that bothers me. Aside from that I appreciate their ability to serve you quickly."}
