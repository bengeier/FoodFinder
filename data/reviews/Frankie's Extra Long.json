{"text":"This place was awesome, cranky old man bar definitely. The staff was friendly and to the point. If you want a cocktail and talk to your fiends, go to franktuary, if you want to eat a good hotdog and drink a cheap beer, come here.   Only downside is the hours, I could totally see myself eating a hotdog of shame here at 1 AM"}
{"text":"You know Frankie's has been around for over 70 years! It is what it is!!! The hot sausage is great as is he meatball and kielbasa! It is part of Pittsburgh and Lawrenceville's fabric! If the dang hipsters are expecting more or a bigger menu don't go in!!! Frankie's has survived without you for quite a long time!"}
{"text":"The chili sauce has a little bit of a sweet hint to it.  I would prefer it to be a bit spicier, but all in all the foot longs are pretty good.  I got mine with ketchup,mustard,chili and cheese.  All \"sandwiches\" as they call them are $2.75 Meatball,footlongs (hotdogs),sausages.  Its 50 cents extra each for chili and for cheese.  Wish they had french fries too :(  They do have a space to eat in there, but I got mine to go.  I believe they are cash and carry only...no debit or credit cards."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints, it's dirty grungy and tasty. All sandwiches are $3.50. I love the hot sausage, got it today but they also had stuffed peppers today for $1 that was also really good. If u want comfort food cheap in a family owned establishment this is the place.  Would so a dinner here but great for lunch."}
{"text":"TLDR: cash only. Good local, homely establishment with great service. Great value. Recommend hot sausage or kielbasa   My girlfriend and I stumbled upon this local establishment as we were exploring Lawrenceville. The staff was incredibly friendly and nice - we got a taste test of their 70 year old famous hot sausages and sauerkraut for free.  The food itself is very homely. I ordered a kielbasa and my girlfriend ordered the meatballs. Both of them came with grilled onions and peppers, which was a nice touch. The kielbasa was tangy and tender; the meatballs were soft and melted in your mouth. Having tried both, I would definitely recommend the kielbasa.  My only qualm would be the bread, if it were toasted this place would be much better!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a hot dog joint that's been around for a while and has resisted change it's entire life. Frankie's is a hot dog joint and that's all you're going to get. The hot dogs? They're okay but they're cheap. What you mostly go to Frankie's for is the conversation and the fact that a little hot dog joint sells some pretty cheap beer. You can chill out with some guys you know've been going to Frankie's their whole life and talk about whatever's on your mind. I fancy the T-shirts they sell and want to get one some day."}
{"text":"If you want a greasy Italian sausage covered in cooked onions this is the place to go. It may be a run down hole but they serve a damn good sausage. The bread is fresh and sausage is cheap. It's a place were you get what's on the small menu and it's awesome.  Also the stink coming off your cloths when you leave is like signal to others you stopped in. That being said the only bad thing is the smell on you and everything is clean but greasy feeling."}
{"text":"Ain't much to look at, but the dogs are exactly what a hot dog lover will love."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Caprice and Mary. I had the hot sausage sandwich it was excellent the bread was fresh I ended up eating two. You can't be the quality of food for the price. A must stop local sandwich shop with a sandwich for 4.25"}
{"text":"This is a staple in Lawrenceville. The food is delicious and they've been around for ages. They offer a great lunch if you're on the go or if you have time to stick around. I had the kielbasa with cooked onions, chips and a drink. They're affordable but they don't take debit cards which is important in this day and age. They're friendly, clean and you get plenty of bang for your buck. Parking can be a challenge since they're on the main drag but it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"You really cant beat frankies for fast cheap food.you can smell them cooking atleast 2 blocks away . a staple of butler street in my opinion. hot dogs ,sauage, meatball what ever you get its good. its a dive of a place... bar on one side food on the other with a small back room to eat 'and where the hell else in pittsburgh are you going to find pineapple pop?!?"}
{"text":"So...here's the thing.  This is not a place you come for dinner.  This is a place where you come to cheat on dinner.  I have had this place bookmarked for a rather long time and have finally had a chance to visit.  I am a hot dog fanatic and am always in search of a good frankfurter.  I have noticed this place hasn't gotten much love in terms of reviews, and some of them aren't the most favorable, but I still had to visit.  Walking up to the place you may hesitate a bit.  This place is not glamorous in the least.  In fact it looks run down both outside an in.  To me, that gives this place some legitimacy.  If you can serve a mean hot dog (and sandwiches) and have a steady flow of customers, who cares what this place looks like.  It kind of reminds you of a dive bar, but with some of the best food around.  When you enter you are greeted by the counter where you can order your food/drink.  There is a small menu written in chalk above.  It's not a huge menu, but if you are coming here you kind of already know what you are going to order.  Thing to note, CASH ONLY.  Don't show up with a big order and think I'll put it on a card, have your wad of cash ready.  Once you order you can then move yourself to the seating area.  Worn in tables surrounded by chairs that are haphazardly placed in this space.  There is also a bar area where you can enjoy your meal.    I don't know why, but I lulled for a bit.  I stared at the menu even though I already knew what I wanted.  I let the person that came in after me order his food so I could scope out how the ordering process goes.  Didn't want to place the fool here.  Finally, time to order was here, if not I would have to wait until the pack of construction workers came in.  I stepped up and without hesitation order myself a foot long with chili and cheese and of course a water to wash it down.    Just so we all know, eating a foot long hot dog with chili and cheese is not the easiest, nor cleanest thing to accomplish.  So I sat my dignity aside and dove into this monster.  Just enough toppings that it didn't mask the hot dog itself.  This foot long had a bit of a char to it even though it was made on a flatiron.  Like it was sitting there, waiting for me to order it.  That salty crispness of the casing followed by the juiciness of the innards, yum.  Then add the slight spice of the chili and cheese and it was magnificent.  I had a tear in my eye.  I thought that was a sign until I noticed to my right that they were in the process of cutting up onions and the aroma was in the air.    Will I be cheating on dinner again?  Of course, this place is more for snacking than a meal, but it was oh so satisfying."}
{"text":"This is the best place in the city to grab a cold beer and a hot sausage don't forget the foot long hotdogs."}
{"text":"Darren  Hit The Nail on the head ! This Place REALLY ROCKS !   Everyone looks like they  enjoy their Jobs here ...   Myself and Eleven co-workers stopped this afternoon and ordered 12 Hot Sausages. We were in and out in less than 10 Min.TOPPS,,,, DAMN They were good ! we might make this our NEW Thursday Lunch spot! **** SUPER*** Fast and  very reasonable prices. I will be trying the Meatball & Foot Long Hot Dog on my next trip !  You really sould try this place if you like food that will kill you. ( Like I Do ! )"}
{"text":"Best place in Pittsburgh to get a footlong hot dog and hot sausage. Always fast and friendly service. Always a treat going here."}
{"text":"I'd like to be clear regarding the fact that this is a review of a hot dog based fast food restaurant, so take it with a grain of sodium, an acceptable level of animal feces, hair, and dermis, and whatever managed to stick to the pig as they were plunging it screaming into the merciless teeth of a meat grinder.  Hot dogs taste good to us for some reason.  It defies logic.  I've pondered the nature of hot dogs in western cuisine, and have found that it's the same as gazing into Nietzche's abyss.  The hot dog will gaze back at you.  These hot dogs, like so many before them taste exactly like hot dogs.  There will be no surprises there.  But somehow the communication pipeline broke down when my group ordered more than one hot dog to split between the three of us.  I enjoy a little bit of sass with my hot dogs, but I would still like to have my two hot dogs please.  Somehow, even though I wanted ketchup and mustard, I had to keep saying it until it became a mantra.  So, the service was a little rough, but I really wasn't expecting the white gloves.  Nor was I expecting the intense battle that was raged between the spirit of that brave pig, and my body.  Ghost pig eventually won his battle with my dignity.  I'll spare you the details.    Long story short, I feel like maybe this place needs to have some health related upgrades.  So in short, Frankie's is good for hot dogs, but possibly bad for your insides."}
{"text":"Nice surprise to see this place still here. Along with Neids up the other end of Lawrenceville, A place we would go for pizza and their Dynamite hot sausage along with Lupies. You can see I'm old school Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"Hipsters wanting an authentic look but a gourmet concoction and suburbanites who prefer Panera Bread--stay away. For everyone else who appreciates a simple lunch with a bag of chips for $6 or $7, this is heaven. The meatballs are made in a crock pot, so they're wonderfully soft, just like the bread. The hot dogs and sausage are perfect. Workers in trucks and old-timers come here. This is a \"real\" old fashioned place, not a lookalike, make believe throwback. I'm always excited when I realize I have cash--it's a Frankie's day."}
{"text":"Probably the best thing I ate in Pittsburgh was a sausage sandwich from here. It was so simple and a touch spicy, just perfect. This was the real food I imagined when I planned my trip here. The staff was delightful and excited about their food. It's a total shithole, but in a beautiful way. I love Frankies."}
{"text":"Last week I bought a meatball sandwich, a hot sausage sandwich, and a Rubik's Cube of a brownie all for around $6.   Frankie's meatballs and hot sausage are both incredibly rich and succulent, the hot sausage being subtly spicy, the bread that contains each being highly absorbent of all the copious juices the meats stew in. Let these two sandwiches remain unsung no longer.   The brownie I had reduced anything Dozen makes into crumbs fit only for pigeons with its flaky hide and its Satanically moist, fudgy body.   Personally, I've never found anything \"rough\" about the service, the ladies behind the counter always taking care of me promptly with a smile and a spark in their eyes. You'll be in and out of there in a few minutes tops, something I can't say about Wendy's, Frankie's killing fast food by serving better, fresher food fast."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to this d fashion place , but was kind of disappointed. Footling bun was dry and cold. I thought  it would be grilled. The dinning room felt like a tomb. Dirty walls, ceiling caving in etc.   I was also expecting a nice sweet cup of fountain coke in a waxed cup, but was given a can of coke instead . I said \"no thanks\" and got water instead . The owner is no longer on premises, maybe that's the reason."}
{"text":"Best service and food I've ever experienced from a \"dive bar\". I ordered a hot sausage sandwich to go before I was late for a hair appointment next door and was disappointed to find out they only accepted cash. I never carry cash on me but the server gave me the sandwich for free! And it was absolutely delicious! I'll be back....with cash!"}
{"text":"The smells coming from this place were much more enjoyable than the food. I didn't have really high expectations, but didnt' realize how limited the menu was. Not wanting hot sausage or a meatball sandwich, I went with the footlong hot dog. OK...I know that isn't much to review, but yes, you can screw up a hot dog. It wasn't even fully \"cooked\" just warm. I failed to finish it.   Mr. J had a meatball sandwich and he said it was pretty good. They only had grated parmesan cheese or nacho cheese for the sandwich.   Perhaps the hot sausage or kielbasa sandwiches are much better, but I'm in no hurry to go back and find out. We were only inside for about 5 minutes, but smelled like grilled onions for the rest of the afternoon. Ick."}
