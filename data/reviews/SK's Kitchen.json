{"text":"Just came in for the chai after picking up some sweets and samosas next door. Not only is the chai spot on (strong and piping hot) but it was good we got tempted by the chaat - it's one of if not the best in town. The menu has perhaps too much variety but I may have to come back to try everything!"}
{"text":"The Beef Burger was amazing! Fantastic value and super flavourful! This is a genuine spot for a fresh meal."}
{"text":"I went to check out this location, its opened in place of Rooster's Edge. The same menu is still exists including my favourite daily special of 4 piece chicken combo with drink. The addition on the menu were the chaats, charga and in house beef burger.  The deep fried chicken was quite good and more crisper than Roosters. The taste was also slightly different but to the better. A great option for deep fried in heartland!  Overall, a good option for a quick grab and go bite.   For Muslim Brothers and Sisters - They serve halal meat."}
