{"text":"We decided to order from this restaurant given that it delivered to our hotel in St Laurent. We ordered a few different meals (e.g., souvlaki, salmon, hamburgers, salad, etc.). The food was tasty and definitely worth the price! They also included dinner rolls which was a nice surprise. The hamburger patty was a little thinner than I expected but what it lacked in size it made up for in taste. They also got all of our customizations right so that was greatly appreciated. 

The fries were delivered in a box with no holes/vents so the fries were a bit soggy when we received them; however, the fries still tasted good so that was a welcome surprise. The souvlaki and salmon were also tasty, while the vegetables were just okay imo. The onion rings were out of this world good! I wish I had bought one for myself rather than splitting it amongst my family (at least now I know for next time). 

The Greek salad was also good (although as a cheese lover I would have preferred more feta on the salad). My only complaint was although we ordered several items for five people they only sent us 3 dinner rolls (we had to split 2 rolls so everybody could get a piece). Other than that, I enjoyed the food here and would definitely order again if I'm ever in Montreal again."}
{"text":"My take out place of choice in the Ahuntsic area. While most restaurants in the area are the standard well known franchises to below level diner places. This spot keeps that classic old family run diner feel where the food doesn't taste like it's from the freezer or skimpt out on the ingredients. Well made for the most part. Pizzas are their strength (Nikos # 4 w/streak being my fav) with 8 different kinds of poutines available, pita wraps & subs are solid choices as well. No take out places are perfect but does a good job coming close. Delivery times can vary depending on how large your order to how busy the restaurant is at the time of your order. Deliveries can take 30 - 50 minutes & I haven't had any problems with delivery people as of yet."}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend on ville st-laurent we ordered out , wow this place was awesome best souvlaki away from Marathon, love their greasy think fries."}
{"text":"Family operated, this is a hidden jewel for your staple Greek food joint! If you're looking for a great take-out definitely go for the Nikos Special #1 which is an all-dressed pizza with tasty bacon and onions. If you're feeling carnivorous, ask for the meat-lovers edition that includes pepperoni, bacon, hamburger meat, sausage, smoked meat and meat sauce. Last, if you are undecided between pizza and pasta, why not have both with the Lava Pizza; complete with spaghetti and meat sauce. Although famous for their pizza, you have to try the pork souvlaki pita - very fresh and tasty. Oh one last tip when ordering for delivery; if you want your crust to be crisp, ask for it!"}
{"text":"I trusted the reviews, bad thing, low quality overpriced pizza. Sad stuff. Will never never order again."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Nikos in the past but I decided to drop by in person with a friend and order lunch. 

Nikos gives Greek styled fast food and I've enjoyed their slightly greasy pizza that was very enjoyable to eat. This time I ordered a pork gyro pita and onion rings.

The pork gyro pita was stuffed with tzatziki and quite yummy. Their onion rings were PERFECT. The right amount of crispy on the outside but soft and flavourful on the inside.

Nikos does service right as well, family run and they care about the product they deliver. They had a small patio outside and they brought our food. Very friendly service. Price tag is very reasonable.

All in all, a place I'll visit again in the future and order from during the winter months.

{"text":"Based on home delivery. Food was really good, fresh, hot, and at a decent price. Portions are huge so a must share. Their fries are thick looks hand cut and really greasy brown, so not too good for poutines. I had their pizzas and their pita souvlaki all great. Overall this will be your go to place for home delivery if you live near by."}
