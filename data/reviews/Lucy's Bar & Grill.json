{"text":"We ordered steak cooked medium and shrimp our plate came out with a hair in it and the steak was cooked more of a medium well. Me, being a server understand that things like this happen. I politely brought it to the servers attention and she argued with me that the steak was cooked medium. She also told the cooks that i said it was overcooked and it wasnt. The remake had a lot of gristle in it and no one checked on us after that. Couldnt even get more water. Overall the food was ok but the server was rude. Never argue with a customer."}
{"text":"The 5.99 sign for the 6 piece fried chicken with 2 sides brought me in the door. My next advice to keep me coming in the doors often is having mon-Sunday deals each day for certain meals. Now let's talk about the fried chicken. Wonderful. Chrispy! It's good. The sides hmm so so sides are a little underportioned as well. Service is good food is little slow to get out. Overall pretty good."}
{"text":"Ate there today. Service and food was great and the prices were right in line.would recommend it highly."}
{"text":"This was a first stop for me and my bargain-hunting husband when we were in Las Vegas. In an attempt to really \"experience\" Vegas, we knew we had to find the cheapest place for a surf-and-turf dinner possible and Lucy's would have won for cheapest hand's down had they taken the BOGO coupon I had for the establishment that would have brought the approximate cost of the two dinners down to $9.99.  Sadly, the waitress informed us that the BOGO offer was not good on any of their \"specials\" so we bit the budget bullet and still ordered...even at 2 meals for $20, we thought we were still getting quite the bargain.  The steak was passable, a bit on the small side, but it was a steak and not just some chopped version molded into the form of a steak. The lobster, however, was delicious and Lucy's clarified butter was the bomb. Now don't go expecting a one pound tail...it is more on the very petite side, but coupled with a baked potato, the steak and other sides, it was enough to satisfy our appetites after a long flight.  And while others have complained about the service, or lack thereof, we had no issues. Our server was very attentive, efficient and friendly.  Located in the back of a somewhat sketchy casino, Lyft provided easy and safe access and return to our hotel after we threw a bit of money into the slot machines there."}
{"text":"My wife & I use to eat here every day 2 years ago! This morning I brought my daughter to Lucys bar & grill she had hotcakes & eggs, I had the $9.99 steak & lobster tail they served it to me cold, I sent it back to be reheated & it was awful! They told me they ran out of veggies & baked potatoes This place has slid downhill! I don't see any familiar faces, its too bad but I almost called the health dept. Avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the price!  If you gamble at the casino with a players card they send you even better deals, sometimes free.  Plenty of great food options."}
{"text":"Reposting this to make sure Iit sticks  DO NOT GO, AVOID THIS PLACE  Had the $9.99 Steak and lobster Wasn't given option on potatoe, no option wether 'fresh' vegetables or salad The Vegetables where obviously frozen The lobster was way over cooked  and steak was over 1/2 gristle.  NASTY FOOD, POOR SERVICE, BAD NEIGHBORHOOD"}
{"text":"I've Fri en by the Lucky Club Casino numerous times and had seen their advertisement for steak and lobster tail for $9.99. I knew one day I'd stop in for it. Tonight was the night. Service was good. They forgot the drawn butter for the lobster but brought it out immediately after I brought it to their attention. When the waiter came back to the table and asked how everything was I told him how the steak was well done (I ordered Med). I wasn't going to send it back but he insisted and I'm glad he did as it was much better the second time. The tail was as expected a couple of bites but all in all a great value with a baked potato and corn niblet. The steak was actually larger than I had expected as well."}
{"text":"Best Steak & Lobster deal I've ever had and I've traveled the world!!  If you can find one better, please let me know!!"}
{"text":"We thought it was great to get a surf and turf for only $10 but the food LACKED seasoning. The lobster was very rubber and the steak tasted very plain. The waiter only spoke to the Hispanic customers as my sister and I have a  white and Hawaiian spouse. The waiter only came to take our order and to bring our drinks. NOT ONCE did they come to check on us. We asked for a box and the check. The waiter brought my box and not once did he have the audacity to tell me we paid at the counter. Will NEVER BE BACK!!! It's not even worth $10!!!"}
{"text":"This past Saturday my mom was surprised when I insisted on taking her out for prime rib at lunch.  So we approach the smallish, dark, slightly smokey sign that says, \"Please Seat Yourself. \" She smirked when she saw the special Weekend Only price of $3.99 - it's normally 10 bucks, still a good deal.  Well,  mom you taught me the importance of good value for the buck, and this place is it.  The other awesome specials were Steak and Shrimp for $6.99 and steak and lobster for $9.99.    This place ain't no fancy rest-oo-rant, but if ya likes ya some grub fo' cheap, dis is da place, chile.  For less than the price of a Big Mac combo, you can haves ya self the Prime Rib special fo' fo'...well, ok -- fo' 3 nineteh nahn!  $3.99, not $13.99 like at second rate restaurants or $20 plus at the fancy tie and tail places.  On Fridays and Saturdays, this crazy price is the favored special.  Come early, and your prime rib cut will be large.  Mine was about a half pound.  And rumor is, as the day wears on and the place fills up, they start to run out. Well, guess what...your meat becomes smaller.  That's just awful when that happens.       I ordered my prime rib medium, and so did my mom.  It came out perfectly medium, warm with just a slight amount of red.  It comes with a baked potato and mixed veggies. You may get turned off by the excessive amount of black pepper the chef douses the prime rib and veggies with.  But scrape it off or tell them, \".Salt but no peppah here... please\".  We also ordered sodas.  All told, the bill was about $12.50 plus tax and tip.  We each only finished half of the slab, neither of us wanted the flab.  So we took the rest home to eat later.  This is basically the restaurant for Lucky Casino. This place is great if you love singing karaoke Sunday afternoons in Spanish, because that's what makes this place rock after the locals go to the noon Catholic mass. English is the second language, however. Speaking of tail, please don't be surprised if a few disheveled chica's de la noche, or Lady Marmalade shows up.  Hey business is down and even les girls get hungry and need to save money."}
{"text":"First, this place is 24 hour.  Their own website and several people have written that this place closes at 10.  They must have recently changed.  They have an awesome breakfast deal between 11 PM and 6 AM.  So we are new in town and want to say this place is great.  We have gotten their fried chicken a few times and plan on updating this review after we try a few more things."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the waiters are very friendly!  They have the best steak and lobster in town. Everything was presented in a eye catching manner!  My husband and Grandson enjoyed the steak and lobster.  I had a Chef salad.  The lettuce was fresh and the meat and other veggies looked and tasted good!  I will definitely come back! Actually, today is our second visit! The first time made us want to return! A must to visit if you're in town! Mmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"The chef left and they replaced him with some skeery cook.... after 2 horrible meals we have not gone back. That was almost a year ago."}
{"text":"I love steak & lobster.  A friend took me here 1 time and since then been coming here.  Really really good price for a steak & lobster."}
{"text":"Came here to investigate their 5.99 1 pound Porterhouse deal. Driving on the 15 freeway going either way, you cant help but notice their huge sign offering this deal. Located inside Lucky Club Casino and Hotel off of Cheyenne and Civic Center Drive, Lucy's Bar and Grill has some decent food at ridiculously low prices.  As you make your way to restaurant, you will see big signs along the walls that advertise some of the other specials like 9.99 Steak n Lobster, 3.99 10 oz Ribeye, and 3.99 10 oz Hamburger.  Me and the wifey are greeted and shown to our table. Since my wife had dinner already, I went ahead and got the Porterhouse deal. Came out in about 10 minutes. If you refer to my pic, it does look like a legit 1 pounder. The taste? It was ok. They don't put any spices on it or anything. I asked for it medium rare. I got it more medium well. I didn't want to hassle with asking for another steak so I just ate it since it was still kind of decent. It came with a baked potato and a small corn on the cob. The baked potato was actually pretty good loaded with butter and sour cream. The corn, well it sucked. like it was overcooked by leaving it in the microwave too long.   Service was good. The guy got our order, brought it out, and gave us refills. I really didn't need to ask for anything.  Some negatives. If you refer to my review of the casino itself, then you will understand this next part. The café itself has a bar situated in the middle towards the back. You have booths lined up all along the walls. Of course you can smoke if you are at the bar. What really bothered me was that it didn't matter where you sat in the whole entire café, if anybody was smoking at the bar, you are inhaling second hand smoke guaranteed. The casino that its in is 24 hours but the café is not. Also, last time I was here, you needed a player card to get the advertised price. When I paid for the bill, I handed him my player card to get the meal deal price. He said that it wasn't necessary. Last time I ate here, they made me get a player card to get the quoted price but this time I don't need it? Come on guys, lets get some consistency going here!  So in closing, this is the kind of place that \"You get what you pay for\" in the end. The meal deals are good, but you gotta deal with negative elements to get it.

{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise, especially considering how crappy the casino area is.  Sure, this bar and grill has the ambiance of a 1980's video arcade, but the food specials are very very good.  I had the steak and shrimp special for $7.99 (with players card).  The special included sirloin steak, choice of fried of scampi shrimp, baked potato, and corn on the cob.  For a special of this type, I will be sure to go back to Lucy's.  The steak was cooked just right, and very flavorful.  Even the iced tea was fresh."}
{"text":"Stopped on the way out of town for a quick bite.  The service was quick and attentive and the food was pretty great.  Definitely felt like a casino, but not like a cheap buffet.  My friend had a steak and assured me it was worth it."}
{"text":"The food is okay but the service is terrible! I've been coming here for a few years and for the most part it's okay but when certain waiters are there I almost want to walk out. I don't even tip the waitress who only speaks to the Spanish customers. Sometimes the food is really good and other times it's really salty. I would complain to a manager but I genuinely feel like nobody would care. It seems like they treat you badly because you're in a poorer part of town. That's terrible!    I'm looking for another place to find my steak and lobster and Salisbury steak because when I find a decent place I'm not coming back!"}
{"text":"Their $9.99 steak and lobster is excellent, but other items on their menu are excellent too.  Their captain's platter contains some of the best lightly breaded catfish I have ever eaten.  As far as their service goes, I can't complain at all.  The servers in the evening are a predominately Latino/Latina crew.  There seems to be very little turn-over among servers, because the same group of servers wait on us every time we eat there.  These servers are friendly, speak excellent English, and have always provided us with absolutely excellent service.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very very good food the steak is to think for me but the Chicken, lobster, Olga the southwest egg rolls !!! I'm coming back ASAP"}
{"text":"I got the steak and lobster for $10. It doesn't get any cheaper than that. This place is definitely a recommended gem for the price and solid service they provide. We were seated right away and they took great care of us."}
{"text":"This is a definite must visit, the food is excellent, the prices are like old school Vegas prices, and the service is very good.  $9.99 for steak and lobster, I was doubtful...I'm not anymore...I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Last night they had a shooting outside of the Lucy club. I was so scared, All Lucy's bar and grill cared about is making sure everyone payed there bill. we had to wait 2 hours before the police let us going because are rental car was where there gun was shoot towards. No damage to the car"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Full of smoke however it is a casino/bar. Also it's a little dirty. Not a place id hang out much! Drink a coldie and go!"}
{"text":"For the price this place is great! They cooked my steak exactly the way I like it. The lobster is pretty darn good. Juan is the bestest! Every time we've been here he's been really good to us. Always took care of us even better than the more expensive places we've been. Host was really nice and attentive. Food here is really good especially if you have a big family and on a budget!"}
{"text":"$9.99 Steak and Lobster Special at Lucy's Grill, now tell me why not featured as Good Cheap Eats in Vegas?  It was excellent, no complaints, now don't expect Premium Steakhouse quality, you get what you pay for. But the Steak and Lobster was better than what you could easily pay double for at any Chain restaurant or diner.  Steak cooked medium rare was tender and juicy, cut like butter.  The lobster though not huge was a nice size and was sweet and tender also.  With a squeeze of lemon and a dunk in the excellent drawn butter made excellent bites, even picked bits from the. shell. The dinner came with a nice baked potato and corn on the cob.  Now a reason that this dinner special may not get more play is the fact that Lucy's is attached to the Lucky Club Casino which has admittedly a sketchy reputation. But don't let this dissuade you from taking advantage of these Vegas Cheap eats. Open 24/7 you can have this for Dinner, Lunch or even Breakfast.  This was my brother's and mine's breakfast!  Nice service and other excellent inexpensive offerings on the menu makes this a go to place, better then Denny's.  Don't come here for the atmosphere. Come for the food!"}
{"text":"Saw the freeway sign advertising steak and lobster for $9.99 so decided to give it a try. Restaurant is \"no frills\" but the service, food and the prices were remarkably good. The lobster was generous and cooked to perfection. I consider myself a \"drawn butter\" connoisseur and this chef does it right. The steak, while not the tenderest cut, was cooked the way I ordered it and had a pleasing flavor. The meal included baked potato and corn on the cob, and we splurged on a house salad at 99 cents. It was very tasty as was the dressing. If you're looking for a good meal at an affordable price, give Lucy's a try!"}
{"text":"We got the steak and lobster for $9.99 and it was a very good value! Portion size was generous and my bf loved the mashed potatoes (he is usually not even a fan of potatoes!)  I am amazed that this is one of the only places that serve lobster for this price, so I have no complaints.  As for service, the waiter was very friendly. I will definitely be coming back again!!!"}
{"text":"Well we got our coffee after the food was served. The food was good but I asked for a different cup of coffee. It still was horrible.  :-("}
{"text":"Almost as cheap as free! JP  No seriously though It was my brother, mother, 2 children and my co-worker eating. I spent $30.00 plus a tip.  My momma had the 10 oz. cheeseburger with French fries for $3.99. She was super delighted! According to her it was delicious, fresh, and irresistible. She wasn't to happy about the coffee. (Nothing to mess up her whole meal)  My bro had biscuits and gravy I don't remember the price but I tell you that he inhaled it. I turned to look at his plate and it was gone!  My little ones had pancakes and sausage. Damien loves pancakes and sausage once he was done he waited because he knew that Natalie wouldn't finish hers and he would take advantage of what she didn't finish.  My coworker had Steak, eggs, and a biscuit. I actually tried this plate it was awesome, the eggs were just perfect with the steak. She didn't even finish her biscuit because it was a very large serving.  Of course I am very traditional I had hash browns sausage and eggs. It was very good.   Over all the server wasn't very loquacious, which was good because my brother just got back into town from Utah so I needed time to catch up.  The negative: inconveniently located inside the Lucky Club Casino which looks so penurious. Just don't let that deceive you because it is definitely worth it.  This will be the go to spot for breakfast. Which is perfect because I live right around the corner!"}
{"text":"The Night Staff Is Cool The Weekend Morning Staff Is Some Of The Worst Service I Have Ever Experienced These Two Light Skin Black Females Have No People Skills Whatsoever and If Your Not One Of The Hood Dudes That Come In There On The Regular They Don't Car About You But The Food is Very Good And The Prices You Can't Beat Which Is Why I Keep Coming Back Just Would Like To Get Some Decent Hospitality From Time To Time"}
{"text":"Its cheap but the food is barely edible.  The crowd there is ghetto and creepy.    Sure, steak and lobster for 10 bux  but The lobster is undercooked and the steak is rubbery. I truly don't think it's safe to eat here."}
{"text":"So, the Lucky Club is a little bit sketch, and Lucy's Bar & Grill is totally worth that bitty meander onto the wild side. The breakfast food is delicious (although once in a while the biscuits are stale), the fried shrimp and seafood is very yummy, and nearly everything else I've tried has been good. When the ribs were on special, they were fall-off-the-bone tender. The soup is always gross and their coffee is usually disgusting, but honestly, for the prices you pay and the quality of food you get (except soup and coffee!), it's worth a try.  The waitresses tend to be a tad on the rude and slow side, but not so much as to make the service unbearable, and I don't think they've messed up an order yet."}
{"text":"Great deals on many different types of food. Good cold drinks, good food and good service.  However this is a Raider bar so buyer beware on football Sundays.  Otherwise during the week and the off season it's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Don't order pie!!!!!!! I mean it. Everything else was OK.  The previously frozen pie had been microwaved to a pale, mushy mess.  The steak and lobster was a great deal and not bad.  Everyone liked their meals."}
{"text":"Went in for 6pc chicken advertised for 5.99, comes out that chicken looks over cooked. So we decided to try the ribs special, French toast combo, and pancake stack, once we received food worst decision that we could've made. Food was very mediocre on top of that, service was the worst. Waitress was too busy catching up on life with other staff and we literally had to go up to counter to pay for food because she was too busy to bring our check."}
{"text":"The steak and lobster $9.99 special bring me here. But I really don't like the environment, dark and too quiet...well lets talk about food. The lobster is over cooked which taste hard and dry; the steak is ok. We also ordered half baby back ribs which is good. If I have to recommend, I choose the $7.99 baby back ribs instead of the $9.99 steak and lobster. The $1 corona is good deal anyway."}
{"text":"Food is really good just make sure you ask for it according to how you like it but over all it's really good ."}
{"text":"Very good steak and lobster special. BUT the fried chicken is the best! The 2 sides not so much. Mac and cheese is always cold and the rice and beans are all beans. The coleslaw doesn't have much flavor and the biscuit was previously frozen. Haven't had breakfast. Juan will take good care of you though.  Beer for $1.50."}
{"text":"Surf and Turf dinner for 8.99? (A club member special, but most likely anytime as well)  Friends were in town and managed to rent a hotel at the Lucky Seven Casino ... small casino with an A-OK dining place, where the servers were funny and making jokes at each other while the other dining patrons stared off into wonderland eating their steaks."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now. The Ribs are fall off the bone crazy good. Wouldn't think this place would have such good food but it does. Had Philly cheese steak sandwich last time and it was yummy. Pulled pork sandwich is very good too. Tender, a soft cibotta bread with good french fries. Cant beat it for $5.99."}
