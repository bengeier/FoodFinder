{"text":"What a huge waste never ever again coming taste like world class garbage!! Customer service sucked!! Very dirty inside and undercooked pizza the by far the most despicable place on earth don't waste your valuable time going to this shit hole."}
{"text":"This location is ok, I have been going to this location for a few years and I loved the pizza so much; however, the quality of the pizza has changed drastically, the dough it's so bland, you can't even taste the tomato sauce and in general the pizza it's very soggy, I don't know what happened. Their salad bar could be so good if the manager would put attention to what their employees are doing, I have seen many times when they refill the veggies just by putting them on top, they don't even bother in flipping out the container and put at least the new veggies at the bottom and the old ones on top. Somebody can get sick easily by this poor food management. I used to go to this location twice a week and now maybe once every three months and just because deep in my heart I have the hope somebody noticed what is happening there, but I really doubt it. Besides, the walls are so dirty all the time, my God I can't believe parents bring their children to this place. If you stop by, at least check the place carefully so that u can judge if it is a safe place to eat with your children."}
{"text":"A better alternative to other pizza/game room locations but recently had a visit for a birthday party that was less than pleasing. The movie room was empty, except for us, and the woman wouldn't turn off the blank blue screen to allow us to enjoy  this feature.  There were 6 pizzas and everyone but one half had pepperoni on it. When we reported that these were not what we ordered, we soon realized that a coupon we presented wasn't even used, and the lady at the cash register argued with us about it. When it became apparent that the customer was not right in this location and that our order was not going to be corrected, we packed up and left. Never had any problems at the other locations."}
{"text":"Come here a lot and it's usually not too bad but today we waited almost an hour for a medium pizza..we watched numerous people who ordered after us get their pizza before us. We finally asked how much longer it would be and our pizza was immediately delivered and it was basically cold..obviously it had been done for a while and the multiple employees who were standing around talking where too lazy to bring it out to us. The pizza wasn't even that good"}
{"text":"They really deserve two stars but they have a salad bar.  The pizza is pretty tasteless and the other items aren't any better.  A good portion of their marketing is focused toward children and for my son this is a favorite stop.  For him they provide a decent product and fun in the arcade.  Not as gross as other children's places like Chuck E Cheese or Fast Forward..."}
{"text":"I am not a huge pizza fan, really. So when I walked into Rocky Rococo's for my nephews birthday I was not thrilled.

There is a nice big regular dining area as well as a smaller area in the back meant for parties. In an adjoining valley sits a smattering of video games. There is plenty of variety like the claw vending machine, skee ball, and good old fashion Pac-Man. Keeping the kids entertained here is no chore (with a few spare dollars, that is).

When the pizza arrived I limply grabbed for a tasting. Holy crud, this is GREAT. I actually want another piece! For those of you in the know...it reminds me of Omaha's Godfather's Pizza. Of medium thickness and simply flowing with gooey cheese, I asked for more cheese and peperoni too. 

I ended up thanking my nephew for picking Rocky Rococo's for his birthday celebration. You should take a chance on it too. You just may love it as much as Aunt Melek."}
{"text":"Rocky's is my favorite pizza, and food, on earth.
As a Madison-born institution, it always tastes better within city-limits.  After years of living in the Milwaukee area where most of the Rocky's are in mall food courts, this place seems amazing.  A movie theater and game room?  Great place to bring the kids.

Rocky's may not be everyone's cup of tea, but this is THE Madison pizza. I don't care what any critics think.  I very well may be Rocky Rococo's biggest fan.  I fly back to Wisconsin just to eat it.  (sorry Mom, and you too).  And on one glorious day at this very location, Rocky Rococo himself stopped by and was taking pictures with everyone.  

Support Rocky's pizza!!!"}

{"text":"It's just another Rocky Rococo location, or is it? This is the first one that I've gone to and felt that I wasn't actually at a Rocky Rococo's. While there was the giant Rocky picture on the wall, with him in his white suit; it also has a large arcade and a cabana. I almost felt like I was in between a Chuckie Cheese and a Dave & Busters. All I saw were adults, but the target was for kids.

If you haven't had their pizza, then you must have either been MIA for the past few years or despise pizza all together. I find the regular slice with bread sticks and a soda to be just enough for a quick lunch. In and out, that's how it needs to be.

What I really don't like is not having the option to be able to bus my own table. It makes the place look especially dirty and discourages me from going there during the peak hours for lunch or dinner. Plus, if they haven't gone around to tables in a while, you're stuck sitting in someone else's mess. No thanks.

Good food, but there's a location inside of West Towne Mall that offers a cleaner dining environment. This location has potential, it would be nice to see it reach its full potential one day."}
{"text":"Rocky's has great Pizza. This location has a movie theatre and an arcade--great for kids."}
{"text":"I made the poor decision of suffering through a super slice combo of breadsticks, a slice of \"Motherlode Sausage\" and a Coca-Cola. Criminy. This is the only pizza I can think of in my lifetime that I regret eating and it was free.

The pizza was just...not good. The sauce was bland, the cheese as fake as a three dollar bill, and the bottom crust steamed and damp with water. The edges of the crust were filled with what purported to be smoked mozzarella. Biting into it was what I imagine biting into an inflated inner tube would be like -- rubbery resistance at first, followed by flavorless chew. It's nothing that should be fed to people or any other animal. I actually regret finishing my meal; I felt ill for a few hours afterwards.

Avoid this place. Yuck."}
{"text":"I've never been to Rockys before but I thought it would be fun to try it out with my daughter. Let me just say, this location makes Chuck E Cheese look amazing. #1: it was a dump inside! And they gave us dirty silverware, no plates to eat on and the soda machine was empty of almost everything! #2: RUDE employees! The guy working behind the counter couldn't care less about the customers! When we went to order it took him 15 minutes just to hear what we were saying. Then, he brings out garlic bread with marinara sauce when we ordered breadsticks with nacho cheese. He takes our number away, brings out my daughters chicken strips (burnt by the way) and asks if we're waiting for anything else. Well, duh! Yeah, we paid $30 and didn't order pizza?! This guy was an idiot! #3: Language: I went up to refill my soda and the employee saw one of his friends standing in line and loudly said, with kids around, \"What the fuck are you doing here?\" Yeah, that was the end for me. I don't need to be taking my daughter to a place like this, so we boxed up our food and walked out. 

Also, what is up with the game room being pitch black? That's not creepy at all! 

Regardless of how delicious the food was, the customer service was a wreak! I'll
Visit the West Towne Mall location before I ever come back here!!"}
{"text":"So unless you plan to order a whole pizza, just stop by any gas station and get a slice for less than $2! I took the kids and had a bogo regular slice and one trip salad bar. With one milk and the rest cups of water, it was almost $12 with the coupon!! I was very surprised. Well the one trip to the very small salad bar was $5.99! Wouldn't have been as bad if they didn't give you a very small bowl to put it all in. That's right, they can't even give you a plate. So unless you want your pasta salad on top of your regular salad, you can't fit much in the bowl. We came around 4:30 but it was fairly busy there. Well the pizza was probably made 2+ hours ago and did not look appealing at all! They had very little selection so I got a pepperoni and the kids got cheese. After looking at my slice I decided I would just eat the salad and let my husband eat the pizza later on (and add more cheese to it). The tables by the game area where all in need of cleaning and were that way the whole time we were there. I'm only giving them an extra star because I have had their made to order pizza and it's ok if you get extra cheese. Otherwise it doesn't seem like there's much on it. Definitely not my go to place but I had thought the coupon would be a better deal and they did have some games the kids could play (you have to pay though). If I go back, I will be getting something else besides pizza by the slice and will only be going because others want to go."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the Pepperoni motherlode pizza. The breadsticks are always perfectly hot and make sure you upgrade to cheese! What would breadsticks be with just Marinara sauce? This location has plenty of seating and a neat history behind it. Make sure you read about the history at the front door."}
{"text":"It's never fun writing a bad review, but people ought to know just how terrible this place is. 

I was in the area with family and was craving some pizza, and this was one of the few options nearby for sit down pizza. Immediately upon going inside, I realized how run-down this place is. It has a bunch of kids arcade games near the door, and the seating area just looks absolutely terrible. It had this weird gazebo-shelter type thing with a fireplace in it, which is rather odd. The menu - or maybe the images on the menu - looked outdated. Service was slow, and the drink area was untidy. 

We found a seat and tried the pizza. I'll be honest, I've had worse pizza. But I've also had better. It seems like most people don't clean up after themselves, because there was a worker going around to tables and cleaning up people's food they had left. 

I managed to have a look around before I left, and this only gave me a further impression of how bad it is. Cheesy (no pun intended) posters on the wall of Rocky Rococo, and in one corner of the restaurant (or does this even deserve that title?), a dimly-lit arcade. 

I understand that this place is definitely more oriented for young kids, but regardless, it is one of the worst restaurants I have been to in a while. Literally the only good thing here was the Coke Freestyle machine. If you can, I would absolutely avoid this place at all costs. Eating pizza in a gas station bathroom might be better than this."}
{"text":"Amazing service over the phone and in store. Last time our pizza was a little soggy ,but this time it was cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"Let's be clear, this is not pizza for anyone that knows what pizza is. The soggy mess of cheese and crust with the artificial tomato sauce and dried Italian spices does not represent pizza. So what is this? Well, I guess to be fair, it is probably a fun place for children to celebrate a birthday. A sort of midwest Chuckee Cheese?"}
{"text":"Honestly I think that school pizza is better than this. If you want disappointment to come to your life then come here and get it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, by far the worst pizza ever. How are they still open?

Update: Management contacted me to ask for feedback to improve. They then proceeded to either lose my advice or completely ghost me. Speaks a lot about the quality of the establishment."}
{"text":"Pizza is fine but service here is a joke! Group ordered heart shaped pizzas on Valentine's Day and decided to dine in- and no, they weren't busy - we waited over an hour and finally went up and said something. Apparently they just forgot?! They refunded us and gave us a free slice each. For waiting an hour?! I'm not going back"}
{"text":"fast and friendly service consistently at this one! good ol' Rocky's unique pizza always good."}
{"text":"Rocky Rococo is around 2.5 stars for me. You order at the counter which brings me to my first complaint -- when patrons line up to order, it gets crowded near the soda fountain/napkin/straw/silverware area. Re-routing the line might help reduce congestion.

The interior is dark and kind of dingy. As others noted, the fact that you don't bus your own table means that greasy pizza boxes and plastic trays sit out for a little bit. This definitely detracts from the atmosphere. 

As far as the pizza, it's just A-OK, as yelp says. It's greasy, with thick and soggy crust. The tomato sauce is way sweet and the cheese is bland and forgettable. The toppings are likewise bland and don't add much flavor or texture. 

Why stop here? The lunch combos are cheap and, while rather tasteless, usually filling."}
{"text":"I always enjoy a slice of Rocky's pizza.  We love the breadsticks with the cheese sause, too.  It's a consistent treat we can always count on every time we walk through the door.

The game room lacks quality games and ticket winning opportunities.  But we don't go there for that.  The dining area is spacious, but it's more noisy than other Rocky's locations."}
