{"text":"The Carne Asada Fries are the best we've ever had, they will certainly bring us back. Potatoes were freshly cut into fries and there were generous portions of carne asada, guacamole, salsa and sour cream. Wanted to take a photo but it was too good to walk away from to find my phone. The fresh chips and salsas were also very well done. The carne asada taco was delicious as well. The tripe and lengua tacos were good but not as great as the fries. My husband (picked up our order) said the staff was extremely friendly. All and all a neighborhood spot that should be frequented."}
{"text":"Great Tacos! This place is newly opened and I recently stopped by to check it out. Very friendly staff, explained to me all about the options on the menu. We only tried the tacos today, pastor was solid, very good asada and chicken as well. Fresh ingredients, I was very impressed for the price. Hot fried tortilla chips were also great. I will definitely be back to try the burritos and tortas.  They have a barley fresca which you should try if you like horchatta. Great restaurant with a nice place to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Not even a one star, go to burrito house or macho taco on 7th ave. The waitress mixes up orders and we seriously waited over an hour to eat what we did not order. The food is average and I could make this at home by the time they bring it too you. Waste of time!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and delicious food, I tried their Carne Asada fries and they did not disappoint. I will definitely be back to have some menudo since they let me sample it and I was impressed."}
