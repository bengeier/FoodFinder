{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, and a clean and welcoming interior made this a great choice for our family of 6 tonight!  Don't get scared off by the steep flight of stairs to get there.   The food is served family style and we ordered way too much, but we still managed to finish most of it.   We had won ton soup, shrimp dumplings, pork buns, special fried rice, crispy noodles with vegetables, sweet and sour chicken and pork.   The wait staff was helpful, funny, and not overly attentive (thanks Kenny).  Oh! And the best part may have been the bill, which was pleasantly affordable for the outrageous amount of food we got."}
{"text":"This is clearly a tourist trap. Not only do they push tourists to their very limited prix fixe menu, but they push the food out so fast that it cannot possibly be cooked fresh, and is obviously meant to get rid of you as soon as possible. I guess that there is a different menu for people who don't look like tourists, and that it is better.  On top of that, we payed with a credit card, which was then almost immediately used fraudulently.  It's hard to believe this was just a coincidence....."}
{"text":"We reached late night and at midnight we found only chez maxim was open till 1 am.  Beef and fish and fried rice was good above all feel gratitude to have worthy food at late night and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Excelente Service Courtier, poli et en français. La nourriture aurait pu être encore meilleur mais je vais retourner avec plaisir."}
{"text":"My friends and I spent a darling afternoon here. At first it looks like a slightly upscale hole in the wall, but the decor is quite magnificent for its sub par location. If you're looking for a cheap place for crowds of people, this is definitely it. The more people you are, the less expensive the food. 15 dollar lobster? sign me up! The service is great and the staff is really polite and friendly. I would definitely recommend this place for groups of locals or travelers from far off lands."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved the food- general tao's chicken, salt & pepper shrimp ( no shell),  pan fried noodles and some vegetable dish that our waiter recommended were all excellent.  Best Chinese food we've had in Canada - even in Vancouver. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Watch out for aggressive Chinese lady who swindled you into the most expensive menu items and hovers over your entire dining experience and then expects a big tip!"}
{"text":"Best service, fancy looking restaurant with great prices. I leave feeling satisfied! The dishes are savoury and the chow mein is especially well done. The meat is well seasoned as well."}
{"text":"Food - We ordered the $33 2 person combo; well worth it - The food came out hot all the time - The portions were very generous for the 2 of us - Very tasteful - Good selection of drinks  Service - Staff is fluent in English, French and native tongue - Staff is fast, polite and helpful in making sure your glass is always full  Atmosphere - Great view of China town from the upper balcony - Traditional cloths and seat covers - When you first walk to the restaurant you see these long stairs going all the way up, they are deceiving because you only go half way :) - The only reason we found this place, was for the guy across the street promoting it; thankful he did."}
{"text":"Excellent Waiters, Fantastic Food, and Great Location. My friends and I are from out of town and this place was definitely worth the stop. Would go again the next time I am in Montreal"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food was fresh and delivered quickly. Servers automatically ask if we want leftovers packed to bring with us."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best, and I come from downhill Chinese food back in NYC. Food was pretty salty. Also hated that the wait staff was constantly upselling stuff. Don't they know it's not polite and they should leave people to eat in peace?"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Exceptionally friendly service and large delicious portions.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Had an early dinner here on Monday. The staff is very friendly and everyone says hello which is always nice. Seated immediately since there was only another group. This was my first visit and I was very pleased with the dishes. I was craving general tao and have been searching for a place that won't disappoint. It was served hot and fresh. Portion is big enough for 3-4 to share. I loved this plate since it combines sweet and savory with bit of spice. I ate two portions with steamed rice and was full. The salt and pepper shrimps were huge as well. Portions enough for 2-3 to share. It had great flavor with bit of spice. The staff was attentive and refilled water. I would definitely return and try other items on the menu. There is an upstairs section for parties. I give 4 stars since the prices are little high."}
{"text":"Tried a lot of Chinese restaurants in Chinatown. The food is OK, but not great but the servers will try to give you less quantity as compared to other restaurants."}
{"text":"We had a great last meal here at this place. Service was cheerful, attentive. Do not be fazed by the steep staircase up to the restaurant. The place is clean. Food is classic Cantonese. We had the set meal for a family of 12.  May even be the best meal I had in all of Montreal."}
{"text":"We were looking for Dim Sum however couldn't find the place we were looking for.  We stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a try.  Its located on the second floor from street level.  When you go up the stairs it can be confusing as the stairs do go up further to a third floor which is where the bathrooms are.  The main dining area was off to the right.  A lady immediately greeted us and pulled us inside.  We were quickly seated and when asked if they served dim sum she enthusiastically stated they did!  That turned out to be a bummer as there selection was small and limited.    We decided on a quick lunch instead with Beef with Noodles and Sweet and Sour pork.  Both turned out to be ok.  One thing I didn't like was the pushy waitress trying to upsell the kids to juice.   I had to put an end to that quick and demanded only water lol.    Can't say too much as we only experienced this place quickly.  Both dishes came out quick and were finished."}
{"text":"We ordered the pre fixe dinner for 4. It came with house soup (green squash), which was delicious. Have to say, I was a little disappointed in the steamed chicken (dry and over cooked), and the peking pork chops (flavor was too sour, not typical of what this dish is supposed to taste like).  The chicken with veggies were very good - we asked for a replacement of the type of veggie and they provided baby Shanghai bok choy. The one best dish was the salt and pepper fish. Lightly breaded and full of flavor. For dessert we had a green bean sweet soup which was also very good.  Overall average meal.   Service was excellent, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Oh man, I really wanted to like this place. We went just after 11pm on a week night. It's a huge restaurant, with nice furniture, etc. The host (owner? ) was very nice. There was only one other table seated when we arrived, and only one came in before we left.  The first thing that I took issue with was that as soon the waiter came to greet us, he looked at his watch really obviously. I thought I remembered that the hours posted were until at least 1am, so  I said, \"I'm sorry, what time do you close?\" He mumbled, saying something about the chef wanting to go leave early  because it was a week night. Well that sucked!   The menu is arranged so incredibly poorly, that it's hard to figure out what you want, especially when you are being rushed. I asked about the steamed fish, but he made an unpleasant face about it. I asked what was wrong with the fish, and he said that I wouldn't like it. When I asked why, he said that \"non-Asian\" people don't like it. That was weird, so  we eventually just asked for his recommendations. He made a suggestion, we said ok, and then he came back to say that they'd run out of it. We went with his second suggestion, salt and pepper sea food.   It was a pile of fried stuff that you could find anywhere. The batter wasn't particularly tasty, the seafood wasn't particularly fresh or memorable. The portion was small for the money, and we had to ask to have any sauce to go with it. We'd also ordered the spring rolls, which were also average. We were still hungry, but were sure as hell not going to get anything else that night.   Such a bummer. There are a few other places open at that hour. Unless you really can't bring yourself to walk any further, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The location is terrible. If you don't know where you're going, you won't find it. The only reason I knew this place existed was because my friend brought me here. She herself only knew of the place because a man outside of the restaurant was advertising it.  We ordered the 33$ 2 person combo and I must admit it was well worth it. This is another one of Chinatown's hidden gems that make me come back to this random overpopulated alley.  The food was consistently hot, the amount generous and varied. The general Tao was amazing, the soup was delicious, the beef was tasty, etc.  The rice was perfectly made and the spring roll was perfectly cooked.   The decor makes it look like a 3.5-4 star restaurant (table clothes, marble, uniforms, decent view, nice glasses, etc.) while the prices are that of a 2-3 star restaurant.  The staff seemed sluggish in English and I could sadly, at some point, not really understand what one of the waitresses was asking me. That's Chinatown though. Also having lived most of my life in Montreal, I'm used to some minimal language barrier so it wasn't much of an issue. Service was fast, polite and courteous.  I fully recommend this restaurant. 5/5 for me.  One thing that was notably cringe worthy though... At the end of our meal, the waitress gave my lady friend a bag of cream for facial masks. My friend is quite insecure about her acne/acne scars (although I have reassured her multiple times that it's nothing). While I found her face and her eyes popping out amusing (because I'm kind of a dick), I felt pretty bad for her :/. I noticed Asian culture has less filtering than Western Culture so I do think they were unaware of this faux pas."}
{"text":"It is a well known fact that we in Montreal love food. It is also well known that we suffer from being a secondary hub for Asian cuisine, as compared to, let's say, Toronto or Vancouver. That being said, great Asian cuisine can be found in our Chinatown, in our recently named \"new Chinatown\" (the Ste-Catherine st. strip between the old Forum and St-Matthieu st.), and even in some of the local \"ethnic\" areas around town (Cote-des-Neiges, etc.). My go-to places in old Chinatown are Ruby Rouge for dim-sum and VIP for a late night treat. Wanting to discover something new in Chinatown, I searched several sites, including this one, looking for some good food at a respectable price. Looking through the listings, one name kept coming up close to the top of the list, Chez Maxim Oriental. I noticed that most of the reviews were quite positive, with the word \"authentic\" being thrown about liberally. So I decided that I would take a chance on a restaurant that I often pass when walking around the area, but didn't pay much attention to. My experience was very different from what I had read from other diners, many of their reviews being quite recent. My wife and I started with a hot and sour soup, which was rather standard, not great but not bad either. It was followed by dumplings in peanut sauce. We liked it, but we had had much better in other restaurants (here VIP stands out). Here is where everything fell apart. When the General Tso's chicken was placed on the table, we tried it and looked at each other with a knowing look of disappointment. The pieces were small, quite bready and just sweet, with no spicy kick to them, although we had asked for very spicy. We also ordered a pork and tofu dish which was also supposed to be spicy, but rather had a bland and slighty \"off\" taste. I realized that everything came to our table at around the same time, after about 10 minutes. This leads me to think that all our dishes were sitting in the kitchen, waiting to be ordered. I had also ordered a half roasted duck and a Coca-Cola. Having half finished our dishes, we reminded our waiter that we had not been served the duck (I decided to forgo the Coke). When the duck came (2 minutes later), it was slightly warm and all dried out. It was very disappointing. When a Chinese roasted duck is prepared properly and kept moist and hot, it's a beautiful thing. After taking one bite from the plate, I called over our waiter and explained that I could not eat it. He was very nice about the situation, but I got the impression he had seen this scenario before. All around, despite the very pleasant service, the very modest prices and the fact that the plates were at the table in the blink of an eye, everything served left the impression of a restaurant that doesn't try very hard because they know that they are one of the only restaurants still open in the area at 11pm. You would be much better served at VIP for late night Asian."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs services que j'ai reçu depuis très longtemps. On c'est rendu au restaurant pour faire changement et essayer de quoi de nouveaux et nous ne l'avons pas regretter. Le serveur était tellement aimable et attentionné que même si la nourriture n'aurait été que passable je serais sûrement revenus pour redonner une autre chance. Heureusement le repas était a la hauteur du service, des portions satisfaisante et des bon plats bien apprêter. Même le thé et le riz légèremen parfumé était particulièrement bon. De très bon prix de bon repas et un service impeccable . Rien a redire et petit plus il prenne la carte débit ce qui n'est pas le cas de tout les restaurants au quartier chinois."}
{"text":"Driving thru Quebec, three Americans stop by Chinatown, Montreal for lunch. Being Asian-American they should know most Asian restaurants only take cash, and being American they should also know that not every country prefers to take US dollars. Between them they had $18 CAD and the average menu item was $12 CAD.   But this wasn't the beginning of a brain teaser or bad joke.   We were hungry and realized no cash might equal no lunch (for a couple of us). Thankfully Chez Maxim was one of the few places on this street that took credit cards, and the a la carte menu looked decently composed. So although the lunch specials looked completely inauthentic in description, and we walked into the 2nd floor dining area to 5 or 6 tables of non-Asian groups eating lunch in a mostly empty room that seated 100, we bit our tongues and proceeded to order.   At $8.95 the lunch specials were decently priced, including a soup and an entree. Two of us ordered the wonton soup with a lunch entree. Chicken with onions and garlic, and also chicken with vegetables. A spring roll and beef chaufun (wok-fried wide noodles with brown/soy sauce and beef) off the a la carte menu rounded out the order.   There were four good-sized wontons in each soup and we were all pleasantly surprised by the heartiness of each bite and the authentic flavor. Same can be said of the lunch entrees, though we did try to avoid ordering the most Westernized dishes so I can't speak for those. I liked that the portion size was very good and aside from very tender chicken (prob due to the corn starch in the sauce) they included a lot of vegetables in my chicken with vegetables. As in they would say in Asia, you could taste the \"wok flavor\" in the cooking at this restaurant. It also wasn't overly salty like many Chinese restaurants.   Service was prompt and courteous, when the server found out one of us spoke Cantonese he was extra friendly, and it seemed to be in a genuine manner. We were very satisfied with the service. If we came back next time we would try some of the other a la carte items since it seems the chef has some decent skills."}
{"text":"Cleanliness:  The restaurant is spotless; you could eat off the floor.  Separate covers on seats, wide spacing between tables. Service:  Excellent, smart, fast.   Style:  Cantonese, the real thing.  Price:  Not very expensive.  We had three adults, and had 5 dishes and the total bill was $68.00 Size of portions:  Large, each dish is enough for 2-3 persons; or 4 smaller persons.  We could not eat all of the food.  Details:  (1) Wonton soup:  Perfect light flavor.  Paper thin wonton wrapping (not like other places which try to fill you up with thick wonton wrappings).   Inside was light, fresh.  (2) Snow pea leaves with garlic sauce:  perfectly cooked, very large portion.  (3) Beef pepper steak with green peppers and onions: Wow!  What a dish!  Very good cut of meat.  Each piece was seared perfectly, and all the flavor kept in.  Onions and peppers crispy fresh.  Flavor was light but beautiful.  This is a great dish if you like steak.  (4) Seafood on top of egg noodles:  Light flavor.  The noodles so fresh must have been made same day.  Generous servings of scallops, fish, shrimp, squid, and so on.  The sauce saturates the egg noodles.  The taste was very good, excellent, the best we have ever had.  (5) Fish congee: large portion, (made at least 7 individual servings).  Plenty of fish, and it was delicate.  The perfect amount of ginger.   (6) Tea:  Mild and not bitter.  (7) Dessert:  They gave us complimentary red bean sweet soup.  So yummy. (I don't know if this is standard or not.)  All of the green vegetables were bright green, meaning they were fresh and perfectly cooked.  We saw some other incredible dishes coming out of the kitchen including steamed whole fish and sautéed lobster Cantonese style.   This place is beautiful, clean, and definitely not one of the little \"hole in the wall\" places like so many other Chinese restaurants in the area.  Clean, delicate cooking, no extra fat.   If you, go; take lots of your friends, and have a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Recently visited Montreal for the weekend and decided to give the walking distance Chinatown a try. The food ranged from pretty blah to yuck. Food came out quick, way too quick. The chicken fried rice was pretty ok even though the peas were hard and uncooked. I would expect that from the cheap, random, fast food Chinese spot not from a restaurant. The roast duck was horrible. Overcooked, dry, and without taste. The spicy fried chicken tasted like fried dough on chicken with no salt.   They get 2 stars for attentive service and the delicious complimentary green jasmine tea."}
{"text":"This was one of the few restaurants open after the Cirque performance in Chinatown, I recognized it up on the second floor of the street with a glowing OPEN sign.   It was pretty quiet late at night, we could sit by the window over the street, they have a big capacity for many guests.  The waiter was funny/quirky and attentive, and the food came out pretty quick, generous portions for a good price (orange beef: so addicting!).  Hot tea was presumed and welcome on a cooler night.  Everyone was welcoming despite a slow and sleepy night."}
{"text":"Dinner for 2A and 2#1 were enough for 5. Despite some reviews I noted the service was great excellent. Very personable and helpful. The food was very good and well prepared. We will return. Thanks"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night here from a recommendation from Chowhound. All in all a solid Chinese restaurant in Chinatown Montreal. We ordered the Lobster Ginger for $25. I thought this was extremely tasty, although hard to eat (lobster generally is). The lobster seemed large though and generous portion! We really enjoyed the Mongolian beef. Cooked well, great thick sauce and a nice addition of vegetables. For appetizer we had dumplings in peanut sauce which were good."}
{"text":"Very dishonest?First of all, they sent a worker on the street pretending warm hearted local people, who highly recommended tourists to try their food. Secondly, the lady boss had us waited for the food for about 1 hour but kept saying it would be ready in 5 min. She then promised a discount to compensate the delay. At the end of this 3 hours lunch, however, she said we only got the discount if we paid cash!  What surprised me were also the bad attitude towards the kids and the poor size of the lobster dish ?we almost got a heart attack when we saw it. Never seen this size before!) I don't believe this kind of mean and dishonest boss can produce high quality food to serve customers!"}
{"text":"first time here....and the food was ok for me...not really good...but the service was really good..the waiters are very friendly!we order the salt and pepper shrimp..not really tasty...and in the menu,not too much choice..need to improve..the good thing is,the place is cleaned..."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Chinese food is really lacking in Montreal. Ordered a crab and fish maw soup which was standard. Nothing to brag about. Order Beef Hor Fun which was decent; Not many places can screw up that dish and if they do, it's not a legit Chinese establishment. Ordered half a duck and it was not fresh and there was clearly missing pieces of duck and it didn't know like half a duck was served. Definitely tasted like leftover from previous days as the meat was very tough and chewy. Sketchy Chinese restaurants do this practice which is very sad.  Interior is very new and clean as it looks like it was opened relatively recently. Unfortunately this place is not worth returning. Do not recommend coming here to eat until you are really deprived of Chinese food.  Be sure to never order Duck or even Chicken for that manner as they probably will serve it with obviously missing pieces."}
{"text":"On the second floor so one must look up to find. Dinning room is very clean and fairly elegant . Helpful waitress.  We ordered two popular lunch menu dishes. They came with ample, good tasting vegetables. The shrimp was not deep fried nor the sauce oily and it tasted wonderful for being healthy. In addition we ordered a plate on in-season vegetables which were \" leaves of snow peas\" : wow! That was a first, very delicious. Basic lunch is $10. So add in a few extras ie beer, extra plate and we spent $50 with tip! Very full and great taste"}
{"text":"Came here three times in a span of 12 days because we stayed at the Zero One hotel right next to Chinatown. Chose this restaurant because in regards to hygiene and decor, Chez Maxim stood out against the rest of the restaurants on the street. Our first experience was wonderful; we had just gotten off a 5 hour plane ride, and the restaurant was brightly lit and had wonderful attentive staff. The food was meticulously prepared for all three visits. They also have free Wifi which is a major plus!   The second time we came during a weekday night, so there weren't as many waiters working the shift. They recognized us from the previous night and suggested a fish that they had bought freshly that day. They told us that if the dish was cooked two ways that the cost would be a little more expensive. Yes, it was good...but \"a little more expensive\" is not supposed to mean 20$ more. The dish was originally 37 and became 57 instead; we were not very happy about that. Other than that, no complaints.  On our last visit to Chez Maxim, we brought along two non-chinese speaking friends. The waitress proceeded to vehemently try to persuade us to get the most expensive dishes of elaborate seafood, when clearly we were avoiding more exotic dishes in respect of our guests. Nevertheless, she kept trying to make us get the lamb stock or beef tongue or a bunch of strange items that we were trying to steer clear of. We ordered orange beef, some noodles, and other guest friendly items and the waitress seemed a little fed up with us. Additionally, we were having serious business discussions with our guests and the waitress kept coming over every 5 minutes to cut in with her chinese, making it very uncomfortable for us in front of our english speaking guests.   Finally the last and more unnerving part of our dining experience here on the third visit was the attentiveness of the boss lady in the front who sits at the bar while all other waiters work around her. We called for the check around the time the boss' friends came in through the door. Because she is the one who swipes the credit card on the scanner for us, we can't have the other waiters get our bill for us. The boss lady proceeded to go chit chat and individually serve her two guests for about 10 minutes while we were waiting. (She had not gotten up at all during our meal except to serve her friends) My friend asked the waiter a bit impatiently if she could please tell the boss to come give us the check because we wanted to leave, and the waiter apologized and told us to be UNDERSTANDING of the boss wanting to talk to her friends and that we gestured for us to wait a little more. My friend had it at that point, and called over to the boss to please bring us the check so we could leave; and the boss had the audacity to tell us that SHE had been waiting for us the whole time. We stormed out pretty angrily after paying.  Overall, great quality food, great atmosphere, unprofessional service. For a restaurant with such beautiful interior and a newspaper article about them hanging in the front door, I expect a lot more. My advice is to come on a weekend or friday night when they're more on top of everything."}
{"text":"Samedi soir, envie de manger asiatique, direction le quartier Chinois. Multitude de restaurant mais celui ci attire mon attention depuis quelques temps déjà.  Nous sommes 4 et nous sommes accueillis comme des rois!! Nous commandons plusieurs entrées et plusieurs plats avec les conseils de notre serveur plus que sympathique!  Le tout arrive, c'est un festin! Nous nous partageons les plats dans la bonne humeur! Le poulet général Tao est merveilleux, les dumplings excellent et les bouchées vapeur sont sans aucun doute faites maison! Tout est bon, le service est apprécié. Nous sortons de là avec le ventre plein! Nous y retournerons c'est sûr!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family for Chinese New Year and we ordered from a set menu that came with a ton of different dishes. Overall, the dishes were decent. I especially liked their bok choy and mushroom dish. Their mushrooms were cooked perfectly, soft and flavorful. All the other dishes were typical of what you'd get at any Chinese restaurant, so nothing that really stood out.  The only real disappointment was this rice noodle beef and peppers dish. The rice noodles were undercooked and hard."}
{"text":"My family and I were on vacation and decided to visit Chinatown for some authentic Chinese food. We stopped at Chez Maxim Oriental. We had a pleasant experience. The food was authentic and the customer service was excellent. The waiter was very attentive. The staff all spoke multiple languages. The pork belly and roasted chicken were really good. Highly recommended to anyone looking for good, wholesome family style chinese food."}
{"text":"Best Peking Duck in China town, very good General Tao as well."}
{"text":"Be aware. The restaurant overcharged if you have a big group of people.  Our whole family and friends went to eat at the restaurant during Christmas holiday. The food were a lot worse than expected. The Peking Duck was the worst I had ever tasted. The Lobster Sticky rice was undercooked.  We ordered crab and fish soup. We got Tofu soup and very minimum or no crab/fish at all in the soup. The restaurant charged items that were not ordered and the quantity ordered incorrectly.  Make sure you check your order and your bill. I will definitely not go back to the restaurant again."}
{"text":"We came for dinner on a Saturday night and I've got mixed opinions of this place.  Service: Weird/awful - waitstaff was very very pushy and overly friendly in an almost creepy way. Each waitstaff seemed to recommend a different dish or selection of dishes and each waitstaff tried to engaged us in many long conversations during the meal which because quite annoying.  Food: Very flavourful and tasty food, large portions. Excellent in terms of both quality and quantity of food. It wasn't too salty, which is very much to our liking.  Price: Very fair prices with plenty of options at different price points. Even for the sets of 3, 4, 5, 6, they come at different prices depending on what you want in them - chicken, beef, seafood. We decided to order a la carte with many separate dishes and our meal came with complementary soup and red bean soup dessert.  Overall: I'd come back here for a dinner or two occasionally, but I can't see myself coming back here frequently for dinners. The service was definitely subpar, but the food and price were very fair and their saving grace.  While there were plenty of tables, the place was generally always less than half full, which was slightly surprising, seeing as it was Saturday night. As well, this place occupies the 2nd and 3rd floors of the building, so you do need to go up a set of stairs to get to the restaurant and an additional set of stairs to the washroom."}
{"text":"Very nice Cantonese restaurant  After a few days in Montreal I was in the mood for some Hunan or Szechuan spice and headed to Chinatown. Unfortunately, being closed for Sunday lunch is apparently a thing in Montreal and my top two choices weren't available...so Chez Maxim it was.  I very much enjoyed the pot stickers (pan fried pork dumplings). Plumb, juicy, and full of flavor they were mighty tasty. The Eggplant Yu Hsiang was good but not great and the eggplant was a little overcooked. Also, while the Yu Hsiang was theoretically one of the spiciest dishes on the menu and despite my asking for it to be prepared extra spicy it was actually quite mild.  The restaurant is located on the first landing of a forbidding staircase - don't worry, you don't have to climb all the way up. The decor is nice with a clean and simple design and cloths for the tables. The service was quite good until the time came for the check when the manager 'helpfully' pre-pressed the buttons leading to the percentage tip selections - 18%, 20% or 25%. So I chose 18% instead of my normal 20%."}
{"text":"You probably heard about this place from the guy on the street advertising it. The atmosphere is pretty nice, the place is clean and looks high end. Despite that, the prices are very reasonable (my table split the bill and it was about $14 each). Wide selection of chinese food, pretty standard chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while on a walking tour in Montreal. There were so many restaurants to choose from in Chinatown but the second floor location and attractive windows looking over the street drew us in.  There are lunch specials with reasonable prices. All of the food was fresh, tasty and prepared quickly. I would recommend it if you were in the area and looking for a quick choice for lunch."}
{"text":"We were looking for something that everyone would enjoy in Chinatown. The problem is mixed reviews and lack of menus available online or in most cases before you sit down. We decided on this place because it appeared to have enough options. And they didn't disappoint as there were many choices and the wait staff was very accommodating in making simple changes to make everyone happy. Was it the best? No. Was it very good and better than most options \"back home?\" Yes. And better still it wasn't very expensive. So it was a terrific choice."}
{"text":"Nice food especially the General Tao Chicken and Shrimp. Staff is courteous and accommodates requests. We went in on a Sunday evening and it was not crowded. A good place to eat. We were 4 of us and it costed about 100 CAD with tips"}
{"text":"After a bit of walking around, we were coming here to eat. A guy outside really talked it up to us.  It's a formal looking interior and the staff is extremely polite. Montreal restaurant service is great all around, but this place tops it. They make you feel very comfortable as you dine and love to converse.  The food is good and are gourmet Cantonese dishes. It all comes out very hot. We all enjoyed our dishes. I got the the spicy fried chicken and recommend it. If you want a seafood dish instead, the calamari my friend ordered is on par.  We ordered a la carte, but there are dining options for groups of 2 or more. The only difference is that the combination menu has a smaller selection. I'm sure you can speak with the service and they would be able to sub in certain dishes.  Overall, a very nice dinner."}
{"text":"Chez Maxim Oriental has perfectly normal lovely Chinese food.  My table of 12 was very happy with the dishes they had.  *  This is all you should read If you have a delicate sensibility.  If unusual protein sources disturb you.  Shield your eyes and have a friend scroll down to the next review.  * * * * * * * * * * * Okay, omnivores - here is the deal.  Chez Maxim Oriental does a fine job on fried pork intestines.  Most pork intestine places cut the intestines crosswise into disk like slices and wrap it in a spiral.  They serve it with a lot of sauce. (Black bean is common but other options exist.)  Here, they cut the intestine lengthwise into long super-narrow strips..  They then deep fat fry the intestine so all you get is intestine skin on the outside and the fat on the inside.  This gives you a high fat treat not unlike a BBQ duck but porky.  They offered a sweet sauce on the side.  Frankly pork fat and sugar go together like popcorn and caramel.  So while I ate plenty of naked intestine strips, I made ample use of the sweet sauce as well.  To make sure the pork flavor came through, everything was seasoned generously with MSG.  I had a helluva MSG headache afterwards, but it definitely made the pork really porky.  *  My normal vegan accompanist was not with me -  but I was able to borrow a vegan for a neighbor from the larger party.  Opposite forces have to be balanced -  so if you are going to eat a platterload of sweetened MSG-ed pork guts -  you want to have tofu and vegetables near by.  This way you get the health benefits from the feng shui.  You tell the tofu \"I respect you\" three times.  You can also wave some incense in an honorific fashion.  You are then allowed to get down to serious business on your pork strips.   * * *  Bottom line:  It was a great meal.  Overall, this restaurant rates four oinks."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant while walking through Chinatown hungry for lunch. We had decided on Chinese but decided to leave it up to chance. They have weekday lunch specials for $9 that include either wonton soup or hot & sour soup and a main dish. We both had the wonton soup which was very flavorful and had thin-noodled wontons which were cooked perfectly. My dining partner had the Chicken and Vegetables with rice, and I had the Chicken Fried Noodles. Both were tasty, cooked perfectly and more food than I'd ever expect for $9 plus tax. The tea was good too, and became more flavorful as we refilled our cups. The restaurant is on the second level and they made an effort to put you by the window so you still get to people watch. Menu was in French and English and server could speak English as well."}
{"text":"The Chinese food at Chez was decent but also very average. I went with my family and we ordered the fish and crab maw soup, lamb stew, ginger beef, Peking duck, eggplant, Chinese broccoli, and mapo tofu. The eggplant and Chinese broccoli were good but those dishes are pretty basic. The fish and crab maw soup was probably my favorite dish, it's basically egg drop soup with generous bits of fish and crab. The ginger beef was juicy but also had a film of gooey starch covering the meat; very mediocre. The roast deck was decent but I wish the skin was crispier and I wish the dish came with the steamed Bao buns Beijing style. I was disappointed by the lamb stew and would not recommend it. There was not much lamb meat; the lamb meat was mostly bones or what I think was liver or some strange organ. The mapo tofu was not a mapo tofu to me. It was not spicy whatsoever which basically defeats the whole point of the dish in my opinion."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there again last night. There are a number pluses for this restaurant that I hadn't notice the last time. We ordered a soup and to our pleasant surprise it wasn't over salted as many other Chinese  restaurants would probably do. The Peking Duck is definitely markedly different compared to others I've tried in Montreal - the crepe is steamed and hence warm and soft. The salt and pepper tofu is very savory. The lobster noodle is another dish that's worth a try. And the complimentary dessert at the end topped off our evening."}
{"text":"Best food and service. Amazing. We r from nyc but living in florida and have such great food in awhile!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic cantonese!! Excellent service. Very humble family-owned business. Clean and proper, wouldn't hesitate to go again!"}
{"text":"We didn't like the food here. The roasted duck we ordered seemed like it was fried. It wasn't delicious either. The Singapore noodles we got didn't look like the one pictured in the menu. It also didn't taste good. It was bland. Maybe the chef was having a bad day. Service was okay, but the food was not good. We'l probably give this restaurant another chance, but it will be a while for us to come back here."}
{"text":"They tried to push food products at us when we clearly did not want to purchase them, overpriced, and they would not allow us to tip the amount we desired."}
{"text":"If you want dinner at 11pm in Montreal, Chez Maxim will deliver.  We had just flown in from Vancouver and had yet to adjust to the time change, so when we were finally hungry enough for dinner our options were limited.  Chez Maxim popped up as being open and just 2 blocks away, so we thought we'd give it a shot, not expecting much.    Since there was only 2 of us, we wanted to order dishes where we wouldn't be stuck with a whole plate of just one item.  With this in mind, we ordered the Korean style kimchee rice bowl (aka a bibimbap) with seafood as well as the seafood and eggplant clay pot.   We were impressed with the flavors, as well as the abundance and freshness of seafood included in both dishes.  The seafood and eggplant clay pot was a definite favorite - flavorful and a nice variety of ingredients in the dish.   Where we were even more impressed was the service.  Attentive but not pushy - not something I have experienced at most Chinese restaurants back home. I actually found myself asking \"do they think we are food bloggers or restaurant critics?\" because the service was so good.  At the end of the meal we were given some of those Korean sheet face masks with our bill!  Random, but provided some good entertainment for the hotel later.    For around $30 we left happy and stuffed with leftovers in tow.  An overall great experience."}
{"text":"Tastes great and is super affordable. One of the cleaner restaurants you'll find in chinatown. Atmosphere is great, pretty busy but not packed. Servers also have amazing attitude. BRING CASH AND GET A DISCOUNT!! Food isn't the most authentic but who cares, it tastes great!"}
{"text":"Babe and I were craving Chinese food on a Sunday at like 10pm and this place was the closest Chinese place nearby that was still open. CMO has your authentic Chinese food and westernized Chinese food on the menu. Food was great, although they did mess up my boyfriend's request on a dietary restriction but we'll chalk it up to a miscommunication. The server was friendly and the best part was that he gave me face masks with the bill! Lol."}
{"text":"Il était tard mais c'était la \"nuit blanche\" de Montréal. Nous cherchions un endroit où manger dans le quartier asiatique. Nous somme tombé sur ce restaurant ; et le serveur aussi agréable qu'une porte de prison nous a pris l'épaule avec force et nous a \"fortement\" dirigé vers la sortie sans même un \"bonsoir\" ou \"excusez  nous\". Je ne peux pas vous dire si la nourriture était bonne ou non mais le service est parfaitement déplorable."}
{"text":"We are from Michigan and it's hard to find good, authentic Chinese. Whenever we travel to a major city, we always hit Chinatown and order Chinese broccoli, clams with black bean sauce and fried noodles. This place certainly did not disappoint. Everything was excellent and we couldn't figure out which dish we liked best bc all three were that good! Service was excellent. Our server made sure we did not order too much bc after a 10 hr drive, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. The place is really clean and nicely decorated. Will definitely try again!"}
{"text":"I go every few weeks when the craving hits. Never been disappointed with the service or food. Centrally located. I often walk down from the Place Des Arts area as it's just 1 block. Great food, great value !"}
{"text":"We ordered seafood fried noodle and stir-fried fish w ginger and scallion.  We love the service, authenticity of the food.  Prices - very reasonable.  We highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm very impressed with this restaurant.  I'm always a little nervous with any China town restaurant if it's not in Boston, but this one is exceptional from all the other China town restaurants I've been to, D.C., NY, etc. We were a party of twelve, we were seated within a few minutes of checking in.  We ordered a la carte; we got a few different dishes and they were all delicious!  Service was great, as well."}
{"text":"Went for a friend's bday. The food was standard. We ordered the combo for 6 (wich had about 5 dishes) plus 2 other dishes and some of us were still hungry. The only positive is the waiter. He was very friendly and patient when we were ordering."}
{"text":"The guy across the street has been there promoting this place for at least a year. I finally listened to him, and it might be the best decision I ever made.  My wife and I ordered a special for two with shrimp dumplings, egg drop soup, General Tao chicken, chicken chow mien, and a beef dish that I can't remember the name of, along with fried rice.  I can't say enough about how great it all tasted, and the portions were very generous. Service was a bit scattered, different people helping at different times, but we always had what we needed.  The special was $42, which made $60 after tax and tip... a little bit expensive IMO, but the food was just excellent, and we had some to take home."}
{"text":"Le canard était vieux, sec et sans saveur. Le biscuit Chinois était la seule chose de mangeable."}
{"text":"so we wanted to la maison VIP and they had no water, so we met some people infront of VIP that we're going to end up going to chez maxime and me and my group of friends showed up to chez maxime, let's start off by saying this place was great! greeted very nicely at the beginning, soup was great, one of my friends really enjoyed the spring roll, we ordered a plate of general tao and the beef and vegetables,  we ordered everything at the same time and we got the general tao after having the soup first but had to wait quite about for the beef, as this was happening the people around us that came after us were all being served their full meals. and afterwards we weren't really looked at by the waiters.  in conclusion the restaurant was great, food was amazing, had a great time and and enjoyed it as a whole, waiters were great to my lady friend calling her beautiful several times which was very friendly.   go here! and enjoy the food, (hot and sour was phenomenal)."}
{"text":"Ordered the $33 2 person combo. Wonton soup was the best I have ever had. It had pork and shrimp in it. Noodles were also not as thick as most of the places I have had it from in the states. Very happy with task and texture. Service was nice and fast. Not quite a 5 star rave, but definitely pushing a string 4. Total bill with tax was $44. They are very nice, and they don't rush you out the door when you get your bill."}
{"text":"Hella delicious \"Spicy Jade Tofu\" dish, good vegan options, one of the few places in the area open late."}
