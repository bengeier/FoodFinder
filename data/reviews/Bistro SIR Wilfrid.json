{"text":"Excellent ambiance! Simple and homey feel! Food is simple and delicious...filet mignon, spaghetti bolognese, mussels, daily fish pick... Service is with a smile, polite and very french & welcoming!  Very affordable (about 12 to 25$ per person, excluding wine and plenty of shooters..lol)...ps, this is not a BYOB!  Friday evenings is filled with laughs and music. They have a comical \"chansonnier\" who delivers good old fashioned Quebec homegrown! Followed by amateur Karaoke with special sing-a-longs from some solid experienced singers, this is altered with lively current and old dancing music or just good old fashioned sing-a-long songs (piano man, elvis, etc..)  If this were a piano bar My wife and I would be there every week! But, given the size of the place it would be a challenge to fit a piano/gear while catering to their #1 business which is tasty food!  Great for all ages however at about 10pm when most of the food is served the age group averages out to 30-50... Casual dress and bring your smile because fridays really makes you want to join in and hog the mike :)  We have made this our new monthly supper out with friends!  On fridays we also tend to hang out right till 3am closing so we get the designated driver sobered up...lol...seriously, we call Point-zero-8 to keep our night problem free and smiley :) not an advertisement for .08 just experience talking ;( lol Enjoy your simple, affordable gourmet food night out! Cheers everyone!"}
{"text":"Service sympathique, le prix est un peu cher cependant (20$ pour mes moules et frites au bleu qui étaient ok mais sans plus).  L'ambiance est sombre (effet bistro) et l'extérieur aurait peut-être avantage à être rafraîchi. Pour l'intérieur je ne peux pas dire puisque les lumières étaient très tamisées."}
{"text":"Dropped in on this place almost by accident and fell in love with it. Small, not big on ambiance, none of the waitstaff appeared to speak english, but the 25 dollar filet mignon special was unbelievable. I recommend it wholeheartedly. If you find yourself stopping at the nearby Le Transit motel (a great deal for roadtrippers) then I definitely suggest you try this out."}
