{"text":"Great experience!  On a girls night out.  Cocktails were great.  I had the table d'hôte menu. Overall the food was great and well presented. Pasta was fresh. I like everything except for the octopus starter which was a bit bland. My friends really liked their food one of them had the shrimp pasta. Overall great experience ! The service was perfect and the interior design was beautiful."}

The flank steak was flavorful and paired with ratatouille - a personal favorite. The salmon was also perfectly cooked. Great wine selection as well. Beautiful decor and great staff. We will be returning!"}
