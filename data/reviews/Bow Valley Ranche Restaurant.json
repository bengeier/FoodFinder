{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. 5 of my lady friends and I went to celebrate a birthday.  Clearly this place caters to the corporate event crowd and not to the smaller parties looking for an upscale fine dining experience.  The service was slow (over 3 hours from sitting down to leaving) and lackluster and the manager was abrasive and rude. The lamb and chicken dishes were cold after waiting for over an hour. We sent them back. The manager came back and said he stuck his finger in it and how hot did we want it??!!! Proceeded to tell us that we didn't know how to cook lamb or how it should be served. He never offered to replace with anything else. Two of us sat  there while the other 4 ladies ate their meals (risotto and Luke warm scallops). We had no idea what was going on. 20 minutes after they were done, he brought out another lamb and chicken dish??!! We said we didn't want it. The server then returns with 4 dessert menus, not 6. That was a slap in the face. We went to this restaurant expecting delicious food, impeccable service, and a great experience.  The Ranche failed on all accounts. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"The Ranche is a great little piece of country in the city. A wonderful historical building set in the beauty of Fish Creek Park. 

They have an ever changing seasonal menu that lets you come back again and again and enjoy new dishes. Serving truly Canadian fare with a selection of game meats and other local ingredients in a casual fine dining environment. 

Head down for brunch on the weekends and enjoy fresh baked pastries and excellent coffee then hike the park afterwards or head down in the evening and enjoy the romantic ambiance of the flame lit lamp posts and candle lit dining room. You will also often find live music to be enjoyed on the weekend evenings. 

The service is attentive, the servers are knowledgeable and the kitchen creates some excellent and memorable dishes. 

We have had several very good experiences here but be careful of their events. The few events that we have attended left us a little wanting as the service tends to lack, they do not seem to be able to handle the large influx of customers at once (we did their New Years Eve dinner and were seated at 9 pm and didn't get our main course until just before midnight). As well, even for a table of two they automatically add an 18% gratuity to the end bill and we much prefer to tip on our own. 

Make the time to head to this little gem and enjoy some great food but try not to feel guilty when Bambi wanders by the window while you are enjoying than venison steak!"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times, and have always been impressed. Today was the first time for brunch. All I can say is it was incredible. The restaurant itself is beautiful. The deer running on the hill as we ate was perfect.
And the food. The food was great. We had the continental platter, with muffins, danishes, and fruit. A great way to start a meal. I had the stuffed french toast, and it was fantastic. Fluffy toast with perfectly spiced apples, real whipped cream, and fresh fruit!!!. Yum. My date had the elk eggs benny, and it looked and tasted great. 
Overall a great way to start a beautiful Sunday."}
{"text":"Wow! What a treasure. Our happy, hungry crew discovered this surprise after a long day of work in the Calgarian suburbs, and what good fortune! The lamb, the fish, the desserts...we feasted! Tucked away in a quiet park this place feels like going home for Christmas (if you descend from a wealthy estate that lavishes food on friends and family). Martin and George spoiled us in every way possible -- we felt like honored guests. Our crew was from Houston, San Diego, and Brussels, and we now long for our next visit to Alberta. Thank you, Martin, for your service! Thank you, George, for your pampering! Thank you, Chef for a fabulous meal paired with great wines!"}
{"text":"I love the service , the menu, and the face that it sit's in the middle of Fish Creek Park. I've been there to eat on Birthday's , Mother's Day , and now Valentine's Day, and i've never been disappointed. The bar is great too!"}
{"text":"Our appetizer was so bad. After we complained about it, our server offered us to have something else. But they charged us for what it should be complimentary. He also told us that the chief believes the appetizer is good as no one else complained earlier...
Worst food and service in my entire life!! Do not waste your money at all!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night and there is no way that I am not leaving a review. I think I may have had the best steak ever!! It was cooked to perfection. We started with the beet salads also amazing, muscles next - they were good. I had the striploin - the steak literally melts in your mouth. The ambience is nice and service is great. They also have private dining rooms if you are looking to book a group. I highly recommend this restaurant - at least once."}
{"text":"We ended up taking a group that was visiting Calgary for a conference. Everyone was blown away with the Canadian atmosphere and local food to match. Each dish was unique and everyone was incredibly happy with their experience.  The staff went above and beyond to accommodate each guest and made sure all allergies were addressed. They had a lot of gluten free options for our celiac guest. Thank you Bow Valley Ranche for providing a truly unique and Calgary experience to all our guests."}
{"text":"Reno's seemed pretty much done and the place still looks like an old Ranchhouse...which is awesome.  This has been a regular birthday haunt for my friends and family for a few years now.  Also a great place to take an outta-towner or a date that you're trying to impress.  

The surroundings are beautiful in the summer and winter and the food is always well done and the menu is unique to this place.  The only reason it doesn't get 5-stars (and the only reason I'm not a regular) is that it's a tad pricey for my liking.  Appys are around $20 and with entrees at $30-40 it can add up fast after drinks, taxes and tip.

But if you're looking for an iconic spot that is off the beaten path and has great food then give this place a try."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times over the years and have loved it every time. Food is amazing, the house is well decorated and gives you the feel of being in an old farm house but with modern décor. The view is great and the entire experience makes you feel like you're outside the city and you can escape from the stress of life for a few hours. 

The food has always been amazing. The prices are a bit high but to be expected when going to a restaurant of this caliber so it's not surprising. 

Over all it's a treat to experience."}
{"text":"Very good! The tenderloin melted in my mouth. I felt I had died and gone heaven. It deserves every penny.The view is wonderful, I saw a herd of deer having their dinner. Plus, the decorations in the historical architecture are delicate grace."}
{"text":"Adequate service nice premises voluminous and expensive wine list interesting menu but poor food prep.
Located Ina provincial park and an historic home we hoped this might become a 'go to ' location for us but the vegetables were indifferently prepared, the fish and meat over cooked and the accompanying sauces bland to insipid. A warning the main dining room can become very loud
A forgettable experience"}
{"text":"If you want an amazing evening out during the summer months on a veranda, taking in Fish Creek Park, this is the place. We went with friends for an anniversary dinner and enjoyed ourselves immensely. Menu definitely caters to the heritage of this location with traditional  game meat, but is quite good. If you are a picky eater and not into game, this place may not be for you as number of items on the menu is limited. That being said, what they do have was well prepared and the group  enjoyed it all. Had a great selection of wine and drinks. Remember, do the veranda in the summer months."}
{"text":"The days are getting shorter and while you had good intentions of doing a longer hike with the 'warm' November weather, you had trouble getting out of bed. So, maybe a walk through one of the parks in Calgary instead?

Fun day out recommendation: take yourself (and your puppy/plus 1/grandma) out to Fish Creek and walk around for an hour or two on the weekend, and then reward yourself with afternoon tea (read: sangria and cheese!).

Fish Creek is MASSIVE and easy to walk around. You can stick to one of the paved paths or venture a little more off course to walk along the river. Keep an eye out for deer! Then, as a reward you can stop in at the restaurant for a (boozy!) afternoon tea. 

Afternoon tea is served during winter on weekends from 2pm - 4pm and yes, it did look more like the 'ladies lunching/grandma' crowd. But the dining room is beautiful and there's a fireplace and if you feel like your own space, there's a room off to the side with a bunch of comfy couches looking out to the verandah that you can take over. PLUS in addition to the usual afternoon tea fare there's a cheese platter ($20) and charcuterie board ($26). I didn't try either this time but I can vouch for the sangria (red or white for $8). Plus, the staff were all super lovely."}
{"text":"This place is so stunning and it's right by a beautiful park. It's lovely and has a hidden gem in Calgary. You can also head for icecream during the day and enjoy bike rides! I love how it's got tons of parking and has pathways that are stunning. The dinner prices are wonderful considering the food is outstanding. The service was amazing and staff was friendly and professional would go again."}
{"text":"We made reservations for Sunday brunch, and I highly recommend it. We managed to get a table by the front porch, which was my preference. We ordered a ploughman's platter to share for 4 people and it was great, but the portion size is best suited for 2-3. We ordered the Steak and Fried Eggs, Foie Gras, Sparks Farms Eggs Benedict, and Vegetarian Fritata. The dishes were all delicious, well seasoned, portion sizes were a bit big for me but you definitely get your money's worth on these dishes. 

My only concern was my egg wasn't cooked properly, as I wanted it over easy, but the yolk hardened due to the heat of the plate which cooked the egg further. Other than that, the service, cleanliness, ambiance and overall experience was excellent and I would come back again for the next occasion."}
{"text":"I have nothing negative to say about this 5 star place with a great ambience and top notch food."}
{"text":"Hits all 3! Service, ambience & food! Been there for lunch & dinner & it's great for either. Chef seems very artistic & creative"}
{"text":"I probably had one of the best restaurant experiences here! It was our two year anniversary so my boyfriend and I wanted a special night out. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were pleasantly surprised at how breathtaking the restaurant is. An old style house with a gorgeous fire place and chandelier, with separate rooms for dining. We were greeted immediately and the event planner Lisa who was at the hostess desk offered to take pictures for us by the fireplace and Christmas tree! I really appreciated this and we had some very beautiful photos to post afterwards. We were then taken to our table which was an intimate, romantic seat in a window out-pouching. For an appetizer we ordered the charcuterie, which was very extravagant. There was a selection of meats including rabbit, pork, salami, smoked salmon and a many others. The accompanying chutney and pickled vegetables were fantastic!  For the main course, we ordered the surf and turf for two. The surf and turf includes bison tenderloin, bone marrow, seasoned vegetables, potatoes, prawns, clams, salmon and scallops. The bison was great, very tasty and cooked to perfection. The potatoes were also phenomenal. However the seafood was quite bland and this is where the four out of five comes in. I felt as if I needed some sauce or extra seasoning on the prawns and salmon. The scallops tasted as if they were boiled not seared, had a rubbery texture. My boyfriend found the salmon soggy and the plate was drenched in butter. I would recommend adding more seasoning and salt! The vegetables were also quite boring, nothing special, the broccolini was undercooked. Although we did not like the seafood, everything else was amazing so it did not make a dent in the night. We will definitely revisit (but not get the surf and turf) and recommend this restaurant to our friends! Thank you Bow Valley Ranche."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like it here. The setting was beautiful and there aren't a lot of places like it in the city. But when it came down to the most important part of the evening, service and meal, we were left wanting much much more. The service was slow and our server was not knowledgeable of menu items. Our food took far too long and when it arrived it was over cooked. Throughout the service we were never asked if we wanted another drink , we had to ask every time. When it came to dessert, we had to settle with our 3rd choice because they were out of the first two. 
We will not be returning to this restaurant any time soon."}
{"text":"Beautiful historical setting, attentive and friendly staff. Have only been for lunch but always excellent. Desserts are a must here...so good!!!"}
{"text":"We've been at Bow Valley several times. Absolutely fantastic food and service every single time."}
{"text":"We first cam here in 1999 where we had our wedding rehearsal dinner. It was exquisite then and still is today. We return every year, as its ambience is peaceful, beautiful and  bestowed with wildlife. 
Excellent menu options with amazing customer service. Highly recommend to anyone wanting something classy yet historical."}
{"text":"With a Beautiful location down in Fish Creek Park,  The Bow Valley Ranche is a unique dining experience. With inside & (seasonal) patio seating available your experience an be different al all times of the year.
On a Friday evening we were able to sit outside arriving at 7pm with a perfect sun/shad mix.
The beer list has some local & world winners in all categories. The cocktail list needs some work however the wine list is extensive and pairs nicely with the menu which alternates by season and is complemented by local seasonal ingredients. All four entrees were prepared with the greatest of perfection and attention to detail. The desserts were rich, beautifully presented and decadent. Coffee smooth and bold.
Our server was easy going, professional and knowledgable. He presented all of our courses mentioning the exact ingredients in every dish and wished us a Bon Appetit! He never lingered nor ignored us. It was a perfect balance.
This is a great place to send someone special with a gift certificate as we had because it made it very affordable. 
Thanks again Bow Valley Ranche for a memorable experience for our ladies dinner club!"}
{"text":"Beautiful way to experience brunch, especially when it's sunny and you can sit outside. Definitely not cheap but a good treat once in a while!"}
{"text":"Update - 01/09/2016 - I went back! I went for dinner, instead of breakfast. I'll leave the old 1 star review below for posterity, but I am changing it to a 5 star. I found out the place is under new management and so I gave it another shot. I am glad I did. Wait staff was attentive yet not smothering. Food was excellent. I had a deconstructed wellington with Elk. My friend had a Steak. Both delicious. I had the wild boar belly and I'd kill for the sauce recipe. It was as good as Alloy's Pork belly's which I liked (only thing I like there) and was probably better. My Friend had the Prawns and they were perfectly cooked in a nice sauce.

My deconstructed Wellington had a fun/unique presentation to it and I felt like I was eating something made with pride. 

All in all good food, good wine, good service. We will be back and I'm thank full for new ownership and second chances. Bravo, happily changing my review from 1 star to 5.




************
**Update - 2014** Took five days but funny enough as I wrote this review an email response did come. They have asked me back to try the Eggs Benny again. I'm undecided if I will bother, but at least they responded... Manager was on vacation apparently.
************
I went here for breakfast... a precursor to a plan to come for a steak night with a friend... but I wanted to try their Eggs Benedict (I'm a bit of a Eggs benny fan, always looking for the next delicious one)  and see the place. After my experience I will not be giving any more business to the Ranche Restaurant.  

First I'd like to point out I sent an email complaining to them about my experience and I have allowed 5 days for a response. I got nothing. So here I am.

- The waiter was nice at first but with 2 waiters and 2 helpers and a total of 6 tables, after selling us a Champaign and orange juice he didn't deliver our food or stop to check on us again until after both our plates were empty.
- I had no coffee from before my meal arrived until a helper stopped by after I was finished eating. He was the first person to check on us since our food arrived. And I didn't eat fast as I wanted to send it back.
- No Salt, no Pepper, condiments of any type.
- No checking to see if everything came out al right. As I hinted at - It didn't.
- My eggs were WELL DONE. Eggs Benny - unless you say otherwise - should be a soft poached egg. Cut into it and yolk run out. These were like hard boiled... I would have sent them back but he just never came back to ask us how things were.
- Tiny English muffin, skimpy piece of ham, scarce sauce and eggs cooked until the yolk was a light hard solid yellow. Maybe the worst eggs benny I have ever had... Denny's does a better job. Buffet eggs Benny are better.

In a place like this I don't expect to have to wave my hand or snap my fingers to get service especially when the staff out number the guests. Ridiculous. How as a server do you not come ask your table - how is everything... especially if you didn't deliver the food. I should not have two bites down prior to a server asking me if I'm good. If your going have a male serve me, he could at least not suck at his job. 

Emailing a complaint and no manger bothers to respond... even to tell me to bugger off. No one at this place gives a crap and it shows. 

Reputation is a funny thing, you have it until its gone... these guys are on their way out."}
{"text":"My wife and I were married here 9 years ago. Been back on our anniversary almost every year since. The food has only gotten better over time. 
Started with the tasty Gull Valley Farm Tomato salad and oysters. Halibut was cooked to perfection. Best duck I've ever had! And the crème brûlée was a nice finish. 
Great service, great atmosphere, great food."}
{"text":"Best afternoon tea in Calgary (nothing compared to what you get in England though).

Don't go to Doves Nest if you want a quality 3-tier afternoon tea experience. Bow Valley Ranche is much better!"}
{"text":"It was my first time and for sure not my last. I was there for their Cork & Cuisine and I gave them the highest rating a yelper could give. I loved how it's located, nestled in the heart of a ranch. Very well versed and warm hearted server compliments the restaurant atmosphere. Sitted along the front yard of this old country home with your loved ones is a moment of memories. One of the best restaurant I ever dined in Calgary. It was a date night with my love. I had french75 as my cocktails, charcuterie for two is good enough to share, their salads are home grown, their surf and turf for two is the best! Thank you for making our night a great one."}
{"text":"It's an upscale restaurant which presents food that is incredible to look as it is to eat. They breaks new ground,innovating,inventing,extracting and pairing ingredients and flavours,colours and textures in novel way.The atmosphere - decor,sound level,lighting, table setting - is inspired. Service is impeccable, professional and knowledgeable and meets every expectation. Cheers to ERICA of being an exceptional host. She suggested a sour cocktail which tasted so good. Made our valentine dinner worth remembering.!! Looking forward to visit again.:)"}
{"text":"As a background, I consider myself a foodie and have been fortunate to travel extensively and experience cuisine of all types and all levels. 

Our group recently visited The Ranche for  a special dinner occasion. I was especially excited as I had spent my childhood in the area and have fond memories. I thought if all goes well it would be a great place to have a corporate event for my employees (approx.112 ppl).  

It's really too bad that I have to write this review. I agree with reviewer \"JO\", this place does not deserve a start at what so ever. It was shocking on a cold winter night the restaurant was cold. I actually saw other patrons along with myself going to the fireplace to warm ourselves. The food was sub-par and when confronted the management and staff were more standoff and argumentative. We did not get a call from the GM so I called a few days later and did not get a call back.  Its really disappointing to have this type of an experience in a such a competitive and thriving restaurant scene in Calgary. 

One should feel well taken care or when they visit a restaurant, the food should be prepared with passion and it should be an experience the dining individual can remember fondly. Unfortunately the owners, management, and staff did not deliver any, and sadly have lost a corporate event in the process!!"}
{"text":"Arrived for a 8pm desert and was told the restaurant was fully booked. After leaving, checked opentable and followed up with a call - I was told they actually had openings. When prompted for why they had turned me away earlier, I was told they only had tables for people who wanted dinner. Keep in mind - there were many open tables and I suspect their restaurant was half empty due to their new management style. Not sure of the intent here - why not serve desert with an open table as it may inspire you to bring a larger group for an expensive dinner at a later date...

Although this is an amazing location with so much beauty and history, I'll direct my higher income towards investigating new dining locations and avoid tarnishing older memories of their past quality service and class. I would not recommend eating here if you desire warm and friendly service."}
{"text":"The walk from the parking lot to the Ranche makes you feel like you're in a fairy tale. The path was brightly lit, and the building was bathed in a soft light that just brought out enough of it's intricate details. A friendly hostess opened the main door for us as we walked up the steps. 

It was not busy when we went on a Sunday for date night. We were lead into a gorgeous dining room that was decorated with a buffalo head on the mantle, and antlers for a chandelier. The Buffalo head scared me a bit because it looked like it could come alive! 

The price is reasonable for the amount of food you get. Our server was attentive and was a helpful guide to the Canadian fare. We started with the elk carpaccio and charcuterie board for starters. The carpaccio was soft and wonderfully flavored. The crunchy shoestring bits (probably from a root vegetable) offered a great contrast to the soft elk and micro greens. The charcuterie board had interesting items, such as beet relish and venison salami. As our mains, we had the venison wellington and lamb shank. The venison was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the lamb shank fell-off-the-bone yet was succulent and juicy. We finished off the meal the Canadian way with s'mores, and boy, we really wanted \"s'more\" by the end. 

Bow Valley is far away from the usual downtown trendy restaurants. The drive is like going to Grandma's house, but the warm ambience, wonderful service and the out-of-this-world food makes you feel right at home."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a really nice evening at the Bow Valley Ranch Restaurant.  The food was great and the service was exceptional. We sat on the verandah listening to jazz music being played by a band on the lawn."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Made reservations for our wedding anniversary. Spoke with assistant manager and got a great table in the front room, had flowers delivered right to the table and they brought the anniversary gift out just as I had asked. The food was absolutely perfect, but the service was even better. And really not very expensive for the amazing, picturesque setting. It's like you're dining at a mansion in Olde Westchester, New York. The server, given that it was a special day for us, made it even better by comping our coffees and adding a special Happy Anniversary chocolate to our desert. Way beyond my expectations and very happy with everything about this place. Might even go again tonight!"}
{"text":"Bow Valley Ranche is located off the beaten track, right in Fish Creek Provincial Park. Don't make the same mistakes we did attempting to find this place. There's only one way to get there by car (don't trust GPS!). For some reason, certain areas of the park are closed off so you'll get stuck if you attempt to drive through it. Bike there instead. ;)

The outside is beautiful. The house where Bow Valley Ranche resides is rustic, homely and quaint. It literally feels like you're eating in someone's cabin, albeit a fancy one. Outside fence is super cute. No bicycles and no dogs in case you can't interpret those mini signs.

We were seated beside the fire. Soothing to say the least. Couple stuffed animal heads round up the decor. A little history on their menu. Cool how it's etched in. Brunch menu is short and sweet. Couple appetizers and then entrees. Their specialty is on local wild game. Pricey.

- Stuffed french toast ($17.00)
- Elk and asparagus ($21.00)
- 2x Game meat burger ($23.00)
- Sparks Farms eggs benedict ($20.00)

This is fancy brunch and while everything was good, I wouldn't trouble yourself to come all the way out here. It was worth trying once but the price point will likely prevent me from coming back anytime soon. Plus, so many other brunch places in Calgary to try."}
{"text":"We had a great family function here in a private room. Martin was a wonderfully attentive server, sensitive to all our family members' needs, from 2-90yrs old. The meal was exquisite, the drinks were excellent (including both house red and white wines). Beautiful setting, impeccable service, and a delicious meal - five stars for the entire experience."}
{"text":"Second visit but probably our last;
Great service but unfortunately the food left much to be desired. 
-Had the Lamb....very tough. Sides dishes were less than flavourful. 
Appetiser: Caesar salad skimpy...just a few leafs. Tasty though.

-Atmosphere is historical with a very special feel! And the location absolutely magical!

- Definitely on the pricey side so perhaps our expectations were, as always, to a higher standard. I don't mind paying top dollar but the food quality should reflect.

Appreciated the staff taking our pictures in their cool antique \"parlour\" area! Again, very friendly and attentive staff.

Final note to restaurant: It's time to provide a decent dedicated handicapped washroom folks!
Also wouldn't hurt to invest in a few more comfortable wooden chairs throughout the dining room areas ....although we did see many that were upholstered. 

Wheelchair Access:  It was a little tricky on the gravel side entrance....I'd recommend others with mobility issues to drive their car right up to the ramp.

Thanks!
Dave & Sandy Nette"}
{"text":"Great place for a quite romantic dinner, or for brunch followed by a stroll on bicycle ride in the beautiful park.
The building is an old mansion and you take a virtual tour of the inside on google street!!"}
{"text":"Finally was able to try this place, wanted to for years, and thanks to a Groupon was able to ! So as far as the Groupon goes it was a great deal except I bought it for our anniversary which is April 15, but unfortunately had to use it by March 31 and only good for weekdays not weekend! But it worked out!
Well to start the ambiance is wonderful with a romantic feel, has a fireplace which we sat by on request, and the entrance is warm and inviting! There was soft background music, which I had no idea it was someone in another room playing!
The drink choices are limited, but Boy my husband was glowing when he saw the scotch menu, which was fitting because I bought him scotch glasses as an anniversary present, and the waiter actually let him use his glass for his next choice of scotch, that was kind! I was looking for a cocktail but had wine which was great, Martin helped me choose the right one, and I could taste it first to make sure I liked it!
The food was fantastic, I had the fish which was artic char it was delicious! My hubby had the pork chop it was fantastic he said, and the sides were so good! The appetizer was awesome but I forgot what we had lol!! 
Service was excellent from Martin, I would request him again!!! I highly recommend this spot, and if warm enough go for a walk in the park after dinner! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is my all time favourite meal and I was impressed with the creative dishes and the flavour of the menu items. The wait staff could have been more patient but otherwise they pay attention to the details- like honey for my tea instead of sugar (preference).  I paid a couple dollars extra for potatoes instead of toast (intolerant to wheat) and that was annoying but the food, again, and the location - beautiful set in Fishcreek Park, are the reasons to visit this location."}
{"text":"Rustic historical mansion nestled in beautiful Fish Creek National Park in Calgary. And for more than one reason my favorite restaurant in Calgary. The food has always been top notch. There are so many exciting options on the menu; tenderloin, lamb, veal, halibut, scallops, etc. 

I was taken here for a secret dinner surprise two nights ago for my birthday, August 5, 2016. Couldn't have been happier!! 

The manager, Arthur, a sommelier with a bright smile, kind heart and very knowledgeable on food and drink, made our experience unforgettable. Our server, Dana, was wonderful, attentive and professional. 

The chef did an amazing job with the food. Everything from the Caesar salad with spicy elk salami, tuna and tagliatelle to the red wine, Prosecco and port with dessert... Was spectacular. And the pastry chef went out of his way to help my then boyfriend pull off the perfect proposal! 

This place is gorgeous. There was a wedding going on that night and the bride insisted we dance at her wedding. She told us that she loved having her wedding at the Ranché. She said they take care of everything! 

Special & gorgeous place."}
{"text":"We came here for my friends birthday and there was 15 of us and we all ordered different things to try a bit of everything and 90% of the things we ordered were beyond delicious!!! I would definitely come here again for someone's birthday not for a casual or random dinner because it's location is very odd and hard to find at first."}
