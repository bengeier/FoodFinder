{"text":"Great diner food pleasant and kind staff. Everyone speaks French and are very patient with English speaking people such as myself. The prices and quality of food are extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"Je ne peux que renchérir sur ce que dit  Dany H. 
Ouvert depuis plus de 30 ans, j'ai toujours connue cette endroit bondée , restau de style familial  avec des repas complet soupe, assiettes principal café/jus dessert au poutine bien traditionnel ou agrémente ;) mini bar a côté si besoin d'un verre pour accompagner... Ça vaut la peine de s'arrêter pour goûter :)"}
{"text":"J'aime vraiment ce petit diner 24 heures. C'est bien rénové"}
{"text":"Je fréquente cet endroit depuis 6 ans et c'est toujours aussi bon. Si vous voulez une bonne mal bouffe à toute heure du jour (24h), ne chercher plus, c'est l'endroit qu'il vous faut. Les poutines, les clubs sandwichs, les sous-marin, les hot-dog, etc, tous bon."}
{"text":"Food was sub-par, the place was dirty and falling apart and they gave me dirty cutlery. The service was absolutely deplorable. First, I waited at the entrance like a chump assuming someone would greet and seat me, instead I had to ask where I could sit. Once I sat, no one came to take my order or even simply let me know they'll be a moment. No menu was offered, I had to ask. No water was offered. Once I ate and asked for my bill, I stood at the cash register like a chump (yet again) while 3 different employees came and went without even so much as a glance. Eventually my waitress came and allowed me to pay the bill."}
{"text":"When I went to Nic Pic with a friend it was packed, but a Tim Hortons-ish crowd. It was full but service was still a bit on the slow side, even under the circumstances. 

The food as okay, reasonably cheap. There was nothing to complain about but nothing really of note. The staff was however particularly fast about coming around with coffee pot, and the food arrived at the table quickly. 

Cheap, hit the spot, but not exactly memorable."}
