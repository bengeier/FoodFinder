{"text":"About a year ago, Romeo's Pizza moved down the road and also opened their Italian kitchen.  I have always been the biggest fan of Romeo's Pizza.  It is the best.  It's all in their sauce.  I had the opportunity to eat dinner last week in their new restaurant.  It is decorated in the \"mob\" feel with a big wall of 20's and 30's photos.  Interesting!  The service was very good and the food, superb!  I don't eat that much anymore so I knew not to get the full size Italian meal.  Luckily they have a Jr size which is over half the size of the full.  It was just right.  I had Garlic Chicken and pasta.  It was sooooo good.  The garlic was not at all overwhelming.  My sister had Chicken Parmesan which she was equally pleased with.  I will certainly visit again."}
{"text":"My all time favorite Pizza. Yes it is a little pricey but trust me you are getting nothing but the freshest ingrediants. My husband I have been going to Romeos ever since it was a small little pizza place across from the gas station and now it has grown. We have tried the other Romeos the one in columbus, wadsworth and lodi. It doesnt matter which one you go to its same good pizza. Ubu"}
{"text":"Not impressed by any means. Ordered a bowl of chili, mozzarella sticks and 2 orders of wings wings and a club sandwich. Chili came out looking like warmed up dog food. No cheese, onions or crackers with it. And the spoon was already in the bowl. Could only stomach about a quarter of it.  20 minutes later the remainder of the food arrived. Mozzarella sticks as well (which should have been an appetizer).  Was not worth the wait. Was told they were really busy yet watched food come out for guests that arrived after us. Won't be back."}
