{"text":"Tonari is, in my opinion, the best sushi restaruant in Toronto!  The presentation is always amazing and unique and the sushi is amazingly fresh at a reasonable price.  The staff are among the friendliest that I have encountered.  Please support this hidden gem so that it can thrive for years to come!"}
{"text":"I recently started working in the area and since it was gorgeous out yesterday (and pay day!) I decided I'd treat myself for lunch. A coworker recommended Tonari so I decided to check it out. I was seated immediately and brought a steaming cup of tea. I decided on the lunch maki bento box for $10.95 and chose avocado maki and spicy salmon maki (there are a few you can choose from).  I also asked for a glass of water and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived with a slice of fresh lemon (not a dried out wedge of bar lemon like some places).

After ordering I was brought a small bowl of miso soup which was piping hot and delicious. 10-15 minutes later I was brought out a HUGE bento box containing 12 maki rolls, a green salad with the typical miso dressing, a cold, glass noodle salad with seaweed shreds and sesame seeds, and some tempura vegetables and shrimp.  

The maki was freshly made and delicious, the spicy salmon was fiery and fresh. The miso dressing also had a tiny kick of spice to it which made it a little different - it was great! The tempura was hot and crisp and not soggy at all, and the cold noodle salad flavourful. I couldn't finish everything but i certainly tried!  Afterwards I was offered dessert (I believe he said it was a type of rice pudding) but I was too full to even contemplate it - next time for sure!

The service was friendly and efficient, particularly when one is on a lunch break from work. I even had time to go for a little walk outside when I was finished. I gave a 20% tip on my meal and I believe my total including taxes and tip was around $14. Very reasonable for the amount of food and the quality of the food that came out.

In conclusion, Tonari sushi is a solid sushi restaurant in the Yonge and Summerhill/St.Clair area. I haven't had a chance to try too many other places nearby yet but I will definitely return to Tonari. Good food for a reasonable price. Thanks Tonari!"}
{"text":"Overall, a nice experience.  The staff is quite friendly - I think they're a Korean family running it - a bit of inexperience shows though.  Dishes are brought out at signficiantly different times (even the miso soup), I'm sure they will smoothen this out.
Tried the gold maki combo with 5 huge rolls on a sushi boat for 38.95 which can easily be shared between 2-3 people.

On complete sides notes, their green tea has an amazing kick to it.  And the owner measures wine in a beaker - I guess to ensure that you get the correct amount?  lol

I'd come back if I were in the area.  
For dessert they give you watermelon cut in the shape of a christmas tree."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Tonari's this weekend for sushi and were pleasantly surprised at this great new find in the Yonge and St Clair hood. Their service was excellent and after talking to the chef and waiter for awhile they even threw in a few extra rolls to our order. Good quality fish, lovely presentation and most rolls are under $12. We tried the lobster roll (good) the red dragon (very good!) and the spicy salmon (my fave). None disappointed. Give this small joint a try! We will be back."}
{"text":"Tonari Sushi has closed down as of Feb. 2013 so below review is no longer applicable.  It is now a Ramen restaurant. 

Delicious food. Fresh fish and excellent maki combos. Tried the Fire Mountain Roll, Crunchy Spicy Salmon Roll and the Rock Star Roll. All awesome. Great presentation.

Had the Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura appetizer and it was very yummy.

My biggest qualm was the speed of service. Had to wait a long time for the waiter to take our initial order and then he forgot to give us tea when we asked for it. He wasn't very attentive overall. 

However the food was excellent so we can forgive the service ( this time around).  :-)"}
