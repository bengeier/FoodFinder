{"text":"I recently discovered this place upon recommendation by a friend for a gathering place where I could hold a quick lunch meeting with friends.  They used to be located on 8th Ave and 1st St SW before they closed down for a while, but ultimately, they moved to their current location on 9th Ave and 8th St SW (directly West of MEC), and they have always been well-regarded by sandwich aficionados in the city.  They're known primarily for their sandwiches, although they offer traditional Italian drinks as well.  I had the meatball sandwich, and it was delicious.  I can't really say much more than that.  It was *that* good; so good that I stopped paying attention to what was in it, and concentrated more on stuffing my face.  Most of the sandwiches cost between $8-12, but they're very hardy and very tasty.  I can't remember what my friends ordered that day, but whatever they had looked very appetizing as well.  If you're located in the area and are looking for a different place to try out, Cafe Mauro is a good option.  This place is definitely on my list of places to re-visit."}
{"text":"My best man at my wedding had the first name of Mauro.  Driving down the road one day, I saw the Cafe Mauro and figured it would be fun to go there on our anniversary so my friend who lives 1000 km away could be us vicariously.   I ordered the chicken Parmesan on a baguette, and my wife ordered the Prosciutto sandwich.  We went in after the lunch rush and were the only ones in the cafe.  I remarked to my wife several times that I thought the sandwiches were taking way too long (12 min or so).    Regardless, we were both exceptionally impressed when we got the sandwiches and it was worth the wait.  They were toasted perfectly.  Crisp on the inside out out.  My chicken had a breaded crust, which was thin and wasn't thicker than the meat as I've seen.  My wife remarked that the flavours were perfectly balanced.  No one ingredient overwhelmed the other, which shows to my mind, the owner and sandwich guru Mauro put thought into his menu creations.    Without doubt, these were the best sandwiches either of us could remember having in years and without doubt, we'll be back when in the downtown area."}
{"text":"these are the most authentic delicious italian sandwiches in calgary. i love it here. i can't believe it took me so long to find the place."}
{"text":"Another one on my list for WOW - **so good**!! I've seen this place many times and finally had a chance to try it and beyond saying it's so good - you just have to go try it!   Everything is fresh - he makes his own breads and you can see all the various ingredients in the front display!   It's a little more on the pricey side but I'm still giving it 5 stars as it's super delicious - enough to ignore the price and go back to try a few of their sandwhiches!!   If you're in the Calgary area - go and try it!! = )"}
{"text":"You can probably see the other reviews and realize just how legendary their meatball sandwich is. I'm going to focus on \"The Dutch\" - a breakfast sandwich. It's fairly cheap and the best breakfast sandwich I've had in a long time. Seriously, go check it out!"}
{"text":"Know what tastes better than a meatball sandwich at Cafe Mauro? More meatball sandwich. In fact I'll wager that this place has the best meatball sandwich in the city. Not overly sauced, just enough. The bread is fantastic and fresh. The meatballs, big peppery and delicious. I don't eat here very often, but when I do it's a really nice treat. I totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"So so so bored with the places in and very close to my work! On a nice day we decided to walk an extra block and found...... Cafe Mauro!!!!!   We got there at about 11:30 and took a look at the menu. I had decided on the chicken parm sandwich and then I spotted a picture of the meatball sandwich and my mind was changed. By the time we ordered and sat down there were a lot of people waiting to order and more were coming in all the time.  We sat for about 15 minutes waiting for our food and watching all the other sandwiches coming out. They all looked delicious! I was a little put off that the group of 3 men that came in behind us and ordered the same things as us got theirs first but ours came a few minutes later. When our baskets arrived we were both extremely happy that we ordered small because even the small was large. The sandwiches were stuffed with meat and sauce and roasted peppers and..... Stuff? The bread was fresh and crunchy and perfect for a saucy sandwich. We both took half of our sandwiches home for dinner and were stuffed.   So glad we found this place! It will definitely be going into our regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Do you know how long I've been trying to stuff myself with a legendary Mauro meatball sandwich? Four years. FOUR!   Okay, half of that time I was living out of the country, but the rest of the time was full of bad timings and near misses anytime I visited Calgary.  Some days the cafe was randomly closed. Others, we went too late into the lunch rush and were almost laughed out of the place for asking for meatball subs. But we kept going because a friend said that yes, it was THAT good.   So: take it from me - go early, and do not be disappointed. The meatball sub is everything an amazing sandwich should be. Tender, juicy, and flavourful veal and pork meatballs that all but tumble out as you eat the very messy sandwich. Add in some tangy sauce, cheese, roasted peppers and savoury mushrooms on a fresh crusty roll and you will be in heaven. Even if they DO think you're weird for ordering your sandwich before 11am. It's just that good."}
{"text":"The name if this shop is IL CAFFE DI CAFFE MAURO. It is ITALIAN. It is not FRENCH. The ITALIAN spelling is CAFFE. CORRECT THIS PLEASE.  Decent sandwiches and terrible, stale espresso made with beans from Italy that have been allowed to sit on shelved for months. Owner demands worship and is annoying. No weekend hours despite being in Beltline, owner still thinks he's downtown. Not a fan."}
{"text":"This is hands down to find a sandwich shop in all of Calgary. I have gone there countless times for lunch with friends and work colleagues and each time I am impressed, the food is always fresh the bread is second to none the choice of sandwiches both Italian and domestic are to die for."}
