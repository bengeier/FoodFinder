{"text":"My first trip to the Mason Jar resulted in an okay experience, which is worthy enough for another future visit to see if things improve a bit.  Our server was very friendly, but she forgot to tell us about the specials/appetizers listed on a board by the television set, and we didn't discover this until long after we had placed our order.  This really stunk because the fish dinner option sounded very good.  Anyway, I settled on a pulled pork sandwich, and the wife chose the Greek burger.  The food was served very fresh and the wait wasn't long at all.  The pulled pork was decent, but seemed way too salty to me.  I've never had salty pulled pork before so this was odd to me.  The fries that came with it were okay.  My wife absolutely loved her Greek burger and really enjoyed the fries that came with it as well.  We decided on desert, so we got the smores in a mason jar.  I would recommend staying away from this because they give you way more than you need, and it just didn't \"wow\" us.  My wife had their peanut butter crunch dessert a few weeks back and thoroughly enjoyed it.  So in all, I'll give them another shot.  I wasn't wowed, but the wife loved it."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and have always had excellent service.  I love to support local businesses!  Tonight, 2 out of 3 orders were wrong.  The waitress took my sons and husband's burgers, that were already cut in half, back to the kitchen.  We expected they were making new burgers.  Instead, several minutes later, they return with the SAME burgers reassembled, and certainly not hot!  Really?!?!? Of course, being hungry men, they ate the burgers.  We were seriously disappointed and couldn't believe they scraped the burgers and reassembled them...after apparently discussing for several minutes on what to do with the situation???  When the manager asked how our meal was, we said terrible, and she was surprised.  She thought it was totally acceptable to disassemble and reassemble the burgers, with several minutes lapsing, and serve cold burgers.  Unreal.  Finally, after conversations between the waitress, manager, and kitchen staff, they comped the bill.  Upon departure, I asked the manager, is this seriously acceptable to you, shouldn't new burgers have been made?  She replied, \"I don't know what they do back there,\" pointing to the kitchen.  Our thought...shouldn't the manager know what their staff IS doing in the kitchen???  Customer service should be #1 along with food safety (serving hot burgers), they have clearly missed the mark.  Very unfortunate......"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and I also don't understand the negative reviews. I have gotten excellent service and great food every time. We usually sit at the bar which may make for quicker service. The owner (I think his name is Scott) came out and sat at the bar with us a couple times.  Very nice guy. I say give this place a chance. We need good places like this to stay around so we have a good choice of dining options in the area"}
{"text":"I have now eaten at The Mason Jar three times and it keeps getting better.  Service was prompt, food was excellent, and the beer was frosty cold. A+"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for a much anticipated Friday lunch out together.  What a disappointment!  Service was mediocre at best.  Great food can make up for bad service, but food was as mediocre as service.  Don't waste your money -- there are better places to eat nearby!"}
{"text":"We had an absolutely awful experience. I took my son late morning on a Sunday for breakfast or lunch. We were told that the lunch menu was limited to about half of the regular menu and only sandwiches and burgers were provided. However immediately we were informed that more than half of the burgers were also unavailable. I ordered a regular inside out burger and my son ordered simple scrambled eggs and bacon. The server returned after some time and informed us that they were out of regular burgers and therefore I was to choose something else. My son's scrambled eggs arrived undercooked and a runny while the bacon was burnt and literally black. We sent the egg meal back and asked to have them redone. When the second plate arrived, the bacon was a limp and under cooked while the eggs were overcooked and blackened. Neither was edible. Additionally, the service was subpar. Only two servers were working but the restaurant was not busy and it is wide open and they should have been able to see from anywhere in the restaurant the needs of the customers. Service was extremely slow. We will not be returning. It's a shame because Aurora could use a good casual restaurant like this."}
{"text":"Went here for a light lunch and drinks. Great dressing options for salad. I chose the poppyseed dressing and liked it a lot. Zucchini planks were great, too--not too greasy with tasty marinara for dipping. Best long island iced tea! Strong, tasted like no alcohol at all, but felt the full effects soon after. Friends got mangoritas (mango margaritas) that were tasty and strong as well--great cocktails!"}
{"text":"Only complaint is the temperament! If its hot or cold out-dress accordingly. However every meal ive had there I've enjoyed! A bit pricey, however they're stuffed burgers have been described by friends as one of the best burgers they've ever had."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend stopping in here to eat, not in the slightest. The atmosphere was engaging and the service was tolerable, but the food was terrible, flavorless, and dry. I had a Mason Mac with brussel sprouts, which was basically a bland burger topped with doubly bland mac n' cheese. I was excited for this location however it seems poorly managed with a bad menu. None of my friends I went with were excited about their food either, and it came up several times as to how we should've just went to McDonald's for cheaper, more appealing food. Originally a joke, but we ended up going there for burgers instead."}
{"text":"Was hoping for something great but didn't even get mediocre. Have been twice and assumed the first bad experience was due to them being new. The service was really bad the first time but improved the second, slightly. The food also improved to barely average at best. Keep in mind we ended up at McDonalds after the first visit because even the kids didn't like their meal. Both trips they were out of multiple menu items. Cocktails list is creative but not executed well. Both of our drinks were very weak and not what we expected. Best part of our visit was listening to the staff argue in the kitchen about what it takes to run a restaurant. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"We stopped in for soup and to check out the restaurant.  Soup was good. Menu looks interesting and not over priced. We will definitely be back to sample more items."}
{"text":"So I was recommended here by a friend of mine. So I came here this past Saturday and it was great I'm mean great I had the chicken hibachi...... to die for great chef they have for the weekend. But my experience from last night was a nightmare the mac n cheese was just cheese sauce and noodles.... gross..... my son and I ended up going to Wendy's at least there's a better option for burgers there. If I ever step 1 foot back into this place it'll be on the weekend when there chef is there.... why he's not there every night I don't know!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere, fresh ingredients our Server Jackie was great.  Definitely give this place a try you will not be disappointed.     Returned yet again, every chance I get I take the opportunity to enjoy some great food.  Jackie at thee bar is awesome."}
{"text":"I hate to put down a local business but one server for the whole restaurant and bland bland food. I wouldn't suggest coming here until they rethink their menu and add a couple servers. Oh and there was a hair in my sandwich yummy"}
{"text":"This place is so great, the macaroni burger is incredible!! Also the Long Islands are delicious and very strong, in a good way. The atmosphere is very welcoming and all of the staff members made sure we got taken care of. Also they have a lot of great beers that other restaurants in the area don't carry. It was a fantastic visit!"}
{"text":"Great spot ! Excellent food and out of the norm drink options that are well thought out. Worthy of a visit!"}
{"text":"First of all I served/managed for 7 years so I am very understanding. Went to this this place on a Sunday for brunch. Servers just looked at us when we came in and didn't say hi. Very disappointed. No liquor license so you can't get a Bloody Mary. So I figured I would get a mimosa. Nope no wine either. Put a song on the jukebox and the sever comes over and turns it down... Order our food and it comes out cold. Server says \"oh I forgot to turn the heat lamp on\". Oh thanks. I love when my food sits under a heat lamp. Brings it back again. My food was sub par. Both servers and the manager(owner?) ate in front of the whole restaurant just chomping away.... Server dropped out checks off half way through the meal making us feel rushed. Now I know why there is only one other table in here today. Not coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is adorable. The name suits it well. They have great service and very friendly staff. Wait time isn't bad and the food is delicious. It is on the pricey side. I would only go there if I am splurging out with people. They have good variety of food to pick from. It's a cute sit down place to enjoy quality time with people."}
{"text":"I had a burger and it was very good.  Family-friendly atmosphere, good selection of items on a limited menu but it looks like they do everything very well.  We had the zucchinni planks for an appetizer and they were very good."}
{"text":"Okay everyone in Aurora needs to go here immediately!  We had a 16oz draft beer ($4.50), the Capri's burger ($11.50) with the hand cut fris, and The Sweet Jar chicken entre ($14 I think).  Everything was fresh and packed with flavor.  Place is clean, beautiful inside and the waitress was very attentive.   So happy to have a quality neighborhood place to go for a casual night out so close to home!  We will be back."}
{"text":"I can't even rate a 0 star so I'm giving a one. As a small business owner, my fiancé and I occasionally like to go out to eat in hopes of having an enjoyable time. Coming from a line cook and kitchen manager back ground I always try and give all aspects of a restaurant the Benefit of the doubt when things aren't good. This was by far one of the worst experiences I have ever had. Me my fiancé and another couple met here for drinks and dinner. There were a couple larger then normal parties in front of us so we expected to wait a little bit for our food. No big deal. We had a few drinks and caught up while waiting almost an hour for our food. Still not a big deal. The food was sat down. We ordered beef stfougenauf which came out with hardly any noodles, although flavorful I was disappointed with the portion size. My friend ordered a french dip, it had zero meat on it and was piled high with sautéed onions and mushrooms. The OWNER tried to make it right by trying to tell us they ran out of meat. THEN Y WOULD YOU EVEN TRY TO SERVE THE SANDWICH? His date  ordered a rare steak wrap, after noticing the wrap was missing all other listed ingredients she still took a bite. Steak was more then well done. We asked to speak to a manager. We explained that we had no issue with paying for the drinks but would like the food removed l and asked for the checks. The checks came and even though I had an issue with it, my friend simply asked to speak to the OWNER and said he had an issue with paying 50$ for the four drinks they had. I tried to talk him out of it because coming from my background I know this wasn't the servers or bar tenders fault. The owner then got an extremely unnecessary attitude and began yelling at him saying \"at the end of the day I could honestly care less if you four never come back\". EXCUSE ME?!?!? I new my friend was out of line but that is the most disrespectful and unprofessional thing I have ever encountered. People seem to love this place so maybe they were just having a bad night, but we will never return to this establishment ever again. And I do not recommend anyone going there."}
{"text":"Loved the food and service at the Mason Jar in aurora..... I ended up talking to the owners and they even have live music and lots of great dishes for a great price.... the burgers are awesome!!!! Drink specials and a great atmosphere..... I visit them weekly...."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after shopping at Aurora Farms. My boyfriend said many different restaurants had been here since he was a kid but I told him the pics looked promising. We quite enjoyed our meals. I absolutely loved the rustic feel of the place. I also liked that they put a spin on traditional bar food by offering the menu of stuffed burgers, which we both ordered from. My only small complaint is that I ordered my burger medium and it was well done. My boyfriend ordered his medium rare and the waitress kindly told him they don't recommend doing less than medium with a stuffed burger because cold ingredients stuffed inside, like spinach and thick sliced cheese, may not warm completely if the patty is cooked medium rare. I completely understand this reasoning. But since I ordered medium, I expected at least some pink. Perhaps they should note this on the menu so you know what to expect, especially if you're a somewhat burger snob like us and look forward to a nice pink center. But the burgers themselves were huge and delicious, I could only eat half of mine. Leftovers were just as yummy! Plus the fresh cut fries were a great accompaniment."}
{"text":"Great little bar/restaurant with unique options. Family type atmosphere with a great little bar. The customer service is great and the food is equally good.  I love the appetizers especially the nachos."}
{"text":"I so want to like this place more.  But the service is still slow after being in business a few years.  it has the perfect location and ambiance to be great. Variety of menu is not great. Keep trying!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend and decided I had to check out a mason-jar themed restaurant. The draft beers and cocktails, as well as the salads,  are served in different sized jars, adding to the theme and rustic decor.   The ambiance was quite cozy with plenty of seating at the bar or at small tables throughout the restaurant. It had a nice neighborhood feel and I noticed that several patrons seemed to know the staff well.   My husband and I split the red pepper hummus and I got the scallops for dinner. The scallops were delicious, but my whole experience was sort of tainted by the hummus. It tasted great with the exception of how much garlic was blended in. Everything I ate for 24 hours after seemed to taste like garlic. However, the service was excellent and I'd definitely like to give it another try."}
{"text":"Went here for a double date with my roommate.  Both my boyfriend and I got big, greasy burgers.  For being known for their burgers, they were pretty decent - cooked just like we asked them to.  My roommate and her boyfriend got pasta dishes and were pretty unimpressed.  With my burger, I got a side of Brussels sprouts, which were supposedly supposed to be \"amazing\" according to our waitress, but neither I nor my boyfriend could bear to finish them, and he will honestly eat anything.    All in all, a pretty unremarkable experience.  The service wasn't too bad.  Our waitress was nice enough."}
{"text":"Disappointing, visited with family for a birthday burgers are weird stuffy mush things that sorta taste like they aren't cooked all the way through. Not very many options that meet specific dietary needs, or nutrition info. We'll try again someday but stay away from the burgers."}
{"text":"We have tried the Mason Jar a few tries when it first opened. Nothing really bad, but also nothing really great. We tried them again in October of 2017 for brunch on a Saturday, but we decided to head somewhere else after about a 10 minute wait to get a glass of water. I've said it before about the restaurants in Aurora; I want them to succeed and it pains me every time I have a mediocre experience at one of them and then feel compelled to write about it. I know there are many people in this town that understand good food and good service, and who are willing to pay an above average price to get a decent dining experience. We'll try them again at some point, but so far, the Mason Jar hasn't been firing on all cylinders in our experience. Three stars because it's in the neighborhood and I want them to be be successful."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now....first time we went for lunch on a Saturday and were the only people there. Got the stuffed burgers and were not very happy, they were just kinda mushy. So sad that nothing was served in mason jars as well.   Fast forward almost a year (yesterday): Went on a Friday night, MUCH improved! Mason jars used for everything! Still stayed away from the burgers just in case. The food was good...Got the pulled pork which was phenomenal and the fries were fresh and hot. Guest got their version of a jambalaya - would have preferred the classic one with rice instead of their bowtie noodles, just was kinda slippery but the flavor was spicy and delicious. Side salad was a good portion and loved the raspberry dressing!  Our server was the highlight of the night: so attentive, recommending, and friendly in conversation. Biggest bummer (meal ruiner) would be that we were the only two enjoying our dinner on the small patio (only two tables) and the owner came and sat at a table next to us and proceeded to smoke while we ate our meal. That was MORE than unpleasant and awkward. Like why?   Bottom Line: It has gotten better, good dishes available and some great service but not a place I would necessarily choose over the other awesome options for a meal! I'll go back again eventually though-and keep you guys posted!"}
{"text":"Being from Aurora, we go to the Mason Jar a couple times a month.  We like that the ambience isn't stuffy, yet it's very kid friendly.  The food is almost always good and it's an interesting menu.  As many reviews have said, while the service is friendly, the food can take a while....so be prepared.  The biggest complaint is they must have some issue with HVAC and ventilation.  We always smell very greasy when we leave and there is absolutely no temperature control.  If it's muggy outside, you will sweat inside the restaurant.  If it's cold outside, it's cold inside!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Prices are great, The stuffed burgers are delicious (I like the green man). We recently had the zucchini planks (SO good) and the potato skins (delish!). Service is good and the decor is really cute inside. Everything is served in a mason jar :)"}
{"text":"Best coffee in town! Our omelet breakfast was delicious. The service and staff are super. Atmosphere is casual and inviting. I wish the new ownership many years of success in Aurora."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great concept.  The burgers were tasty, but they were extremely overcooked.  We will try again and hope for a different result."}
{"text":"Do NOT come here.  We just waited over an hour, and left with no food. We sat at the bar, the poor bar tender was all alone, never stopped running in the over hour we waited AFTER we ordered. The \"mananger\" blamed the bar tender! We watched this woman bust ass  ( and tipped her accordingly) all night. He was a complete jerk. Bar tender went back numerous times to check on our order. Wish I could give less than one star. However, the drinks were great."}
{"text":"We had great service and the pulled pork was awesome. We also had a burger and the Mac&cheese which were both really good."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, both times on a Sunday.  The restaurant is empty, probably since they only sell beer on Sundays.  The restaurant has a bar vibe, real cozy as well.  Good menu, basic pub fare for lunch and dinner.  Nice breakfast selections, and you can tell that the ingredients are fresh.  You can get a variety of omelets, french toast, breakfast sandwiches, and basic scramble eggs.  All are generous size for the price.  Nice sandwich selection.  Their featured item is their stuffed burgers.  I'll admit I like my burgers plain, with lettuce, tomato and onion (they have that on the menu), but I tried one of their stuffed burgers - the Brick House.  Nicely done.  Tasty.  Very filling.  Food took a little while longer than expected to arrive, even during a slow time.  Service was attentive.  Overall, would come back, especially for breakfast."}
{"text":"I don't understand all of the negative reviews about this place.  The service was great both times we've been there (breakfast and dinner) the waitress seemed knowledgeable about the menu and didn't rush us.    The first time we were there we got breakfast.  My fiance had the sausage and gravy and it was delicious.  You could tell it was made from scratch and was a generous portion.  I had the turkey croissant., normally I don't like turkey (on anything or by itself) but I actually liked it on this.  The croissant also was fresh with a perfect runny egg on it.    The second time we both got the calamari and we each got burgers.  The calamari was crispy and cooked perfectly (seriously, I hate chewy calamari) and it was served with a jalapeno sauce which really complemented it.  The burgers are all \"stuffed\" (this is clearly stated on the menu) we both got the Brickhouse burger and it was really good and juicy.  My biggest issue with places is whenever they overcook everything.  If you are expecting a McDonalds burger (small, overcooked, salty) then no, this will not be good.  If you like a real burger (you can tell they make them by hand) that isn't cooked for 20 minutes then you will like these burgers.  I also had two cocktails...a margarita ($4 tequila) which was really good...pretty sure it was made from scratch and a moscow mule.  Both of them packed a punch and were very good.  The atmosphere is really nice and laid back inside...I love the painted brick and wood details.  There is a small bar and the kitchen is open to the dining room.  Overall we had a really nice meal in a great atmosphere, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is on my top ten! Waitress was awesome! The food was spectacular! I had the artichoke spinach soup and the quesadilla!!! Thank you for taking a picture of our group!"}
{"text":"First time here and my family and I love it.  Great burgers, chicken dish was great, and the kids ( 15 and 12) fought over deserts. Great beer selection and great food."}
{"text":"As a person who doesn't order burgers, this is my place to go for a burger! Awesome service and a nice place. Great for two or a group, great hangout spot."}
{"text":"Stopped here bc of the reviews on Yelp and it was close to my father in laws house.   I ordered the Cobb salad - it was large and had real turkey, not turkey lunch meat. The raspberry vinaigrette dressing was delicious   My husband ordered a jalapeño stuffed burger with Brussel sprouts and Mac and cheese. He loved everything.   My father in law ordered the American burger with fries. He enjoyed it very much.   My husband got cheesecake and we both had coffee. The coffee was delicious and the cheesecake was homemade"}
{"text":"Firstly, I want to be clear I think the food is VERY good, but management has some work to do on who they hire and being more sanitary. The tables and condiments are nasty and my waitress last time was probably the rudest woman I've ever had serve me before (restaurant was not busy-she only had our table to worry about). I have served before myself and her attitude was outrageous- she rolled her eyes at everything we asked for EVEN OUR ORDER OF FOOD!! Lol"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had. Wait staff left a little to be desired but worked as a team to get us what we needed. Atmosphere is definitely small town chic. I had the jalapeño burger and it was amazing. The fresh cut fries were to die for."}
{"text":"Here again with friends. The food and spirits are very enjoyable. I'm always going to remember this da. Our good friend Elvis is going away and we will miss him dearly."}
{"text":"Having passed The Mason Jar many times, we decided to stop in for a late lunch the other day.  Bartender was very helpful with suggestions and we both got specialty burgers with fries.  The burgers where top notch -- not frozen patties, but custom built per our order.  But what always impresses or disappoints me and makes my judgement of an establishment are the fries.  Do the feel greasy?  Are they fresh?  That generally indicates a restaurant's cleanliness and willingness to keep their oil fresh.  The Mason Jar passed all the tests!  Cool little pub in an old, historic building.  Kudos to the owner for keeping it classic!  Prices were extremely reasonable.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My in-laws hosted our rehearsal dinner at The Mason Jar and it was perfect! They chose to have buffet style and had pasta station with different sauces, flat breads, and other apps....we even had dessert! It turned out perfect!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place by chance. Found it on this app just looking for someplace different to eat after work. I was greatly surprised!   Food was great! Service was fast and friendly.  Will be adding this to my regular rotation."}
{"text":"Food is good! Excellent fried pickles. Great burgers - I had peanut butter and bacon stuffed burger - so good. Drinks are good - my wife loved her dirty martini. Service is good! Aesthetic of restaurant is cool and cozy. So why the crappy rating? This place should be four-ish stars EXCEPT it freaking makes you smell like oily greazey grossness forever. My clothes stank the next day. I'm not a picky person or clean freak and I don't mind if a burger joint/dive puts a little stank on your clothes. But this was INTENSE. It was pervasive while there and stuck with us long after we left. I honestly don't know if we will be back just for that reason which seems like a very fixable issue. If it gets better, this place is definitely worth going to over and over."}
{"text":"I had a great experience. Friendly staff, great beer choices, flat screens, internet juke box. Real nice warm interior. Options to sit are the bar, high top or regular sit down. Stuffed burgers, grass fed beef and chicken. The food is great and for what you get it's reasonable. It's worth a trip back."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and I had an all right experience.  There are very few non-chain restaurants (or restaurants) in the area, so I love places like this.  My sister and I both ordered the Brick House burger. She said she really didn't care for it at all, but I thought it was great. I thought it had flavor and had absolutely no complaints about it.  She also ordered the blueberry ice cream that we were told is made in-house for dessert-she like that, but I did not care for it once bit. So, I guess we just have different tastes!   The service was ok.  I stood around for a little bit until I was able to grab a waitress (they were not busy) to ask if I should seat myself or not. She said no, seated me, asked me what I wanted to drink.  I never received the water I ordered.  We ended up having a different waitress actually serving us, but still..  I really hope they can or at least try to do something about the acoustics in that place. OMG it was so loud.  There was a table of about 15 middle aged adults--in their 40s or so. Typical men that think everything they say is funny and important, and their wives that dress like they are in their mid 20's and get drunk off one glass of wine.  They were so loud, we almost stood up and left as soon as we sat down.  They quieted down a little bit oince they got their food, but we couldn't wait for them to leave.  I say give this place a chance.  Support your local business."}
{"text":"Overall it was a great meal! Food come out quick, and service was excellent! It also had a great atmosphere! The only complaint was it was a little expensive. The food was good, but not worth the price. We most likely will return!"}
{"text":"Great selection on draft beers.. Staff was very friendly. Grass fed stuffed burgers are amazing. Not many good places to just have a  drink and unwind in this area I would consider this one of the best."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice - once with friends on the back patio and once at the bar. Both experiences were very good. On our most recent visit there was a 10 minute wait for seating, so we decided to sit at the bar and have a drink. They have a great craft list on draft that is always rotating. When we were there the options included a few options from Heavy Seas, Southern Tier, and a few others that I can't seem to remember.   Our bartender was so good that we decided to stay at the bar. The place really filled up around 7pm, but we were hunkered down and enjoyed the half price apps that they boast for happy hour - even on Fridays! Their beer is prices a bit high for my liking. Even with the happy hour $1 off, my beers were still $5.75 each. Too much.  We did the potato skins, zucchini spears, and loaded fries - all were very good.   On the previous visit we hit their famous stuffed burgers which were a great choice.   There are not a lot of \"not chain\" places in the Aurora/Streetsboro area, so this little place is a really nice addition to the neighborhood. Try it out and hit the happy hour from 4-7p"}
{"text":"Our family, including our precious Ruby enjoy the back patio. Delicious food, excellent service and a few of my favorite brews. Dog friendly , Kid friendly and Tummy and Tastebud friendly."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday around 2pm for a late lunch with a friend. The bar was particularly busy at this time so it was pretty noisy. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of the mac and cheese. Both were very good. The waitress was decent but in the end she seemed to disappear which caused a little wait for the check- not too big a deal because we weren't in a huge rush. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I stopped in here a couple weeks ago for the first time, and I'm really glad I did!  I was with my husband and some friends from out of town. We met there for an early dinner and easily got a table. The wait staff was friendly and so very attentive!  We started with an order of zucchini planks to share. The marinara that comes with it?!?! Holy freshness!  It had such a bright taste!  I later found out that it's made fresh, in-house. So good!  For dinner I went with the \"Capri's\" stuffed burger. It's basically a Caprese Salad stuffed inside a burger!  Mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil....a fantastic flavor combination in a perfectly cooked, juicy burger!  My husband opted for the Rustic Cajun Jambalaya, which was served over bow-tie pasta for a different twist!  Again, another flavorful dish!   I almost forgot to mention my perfectly mixed Manhattan!  So good I had to have 2! In a nutshell...friendly service paired with fresh, original dishes....we have ourselves a winner!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst dining establishment in this area. The OWNER told me \"he hopes he never sees us again\" more than once. This could be acceptable if I was the problem, but after waiting nearly an hour for our food, which came out absolutely horrible, we didn't want the food. I've never been to the mason jar and I will never return. I will also save people their time and money....DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! Charging $15 per meal and $10 per drink I expect more."}
