{"text":"Been here a few times and I have always been impressed by the speed of their service. I have always gotten my orders right. There is a monitor that tells upcoming orders being made and what is the current order number they are serving. Service has been quick, especially during busy breakfast hours and cashiers are friendly.

{"text":"Yes I'm reviewing a McDonald's.  It's because I walked in here and noticed something that I've yet to see in a McD's!  They have an electronic order machine.  No need to talk to a human - just plunk in your order, get the receipt and then wait for your food!

If you can't be bothered with a drive in (personally I like to stand by and watch the people who make my food like a hawk so they can't do something undesirable with it..) and then lines inside are long then there is this option to speed things up.

Interesting..like the Jetson's coming to life!  And who doesn't like the world the Jetson's live in?"}
{"text":"This was one of the earlier restaurants to get the new makeover, and though inside it looks good, there are quite a few migrants here who are pretty aggressive, plus there are serious problems on how this place is run. STAY AWAY and spend your money elsewhere.

The people here are completely the worst, I can't honestly pick if it's the staff or the troubled youth that stay here all day. Staff here barely get orders right, and even if they do, you get shortchanged or get graced with their half assed effort. I always get fish filet, end up having the cheese on top or outside of my sandwich 80% of the time here. 

I was nearly pick-pocketed here by the migrants that frequent this place, but I had my wallet chained to my belt loop and scared the kid off when I looked over. Some of my other friends get sexually harassed here constantly. Management does nothing, neither does corporate, completely useless wastes of life."}
