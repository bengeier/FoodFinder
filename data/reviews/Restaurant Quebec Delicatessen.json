{"text":"Classic Burger with cheese is a must! I know this Montreal institution is known for their pizza but their burgers give pizza a run for it's money! Poutine was good and savory but a bit too much BBQ gravy for my taste."}
{"text":"This is MY deli... and I mean that I've grown up in its shadow and as an adult, I realize just how lucky I was!

I now base my judgement on pizza and poutine on theirs!  

Their poutine is now served, at your taste, au gratin or with curds, but it used to be au gratin only and it is to this day, how i like it best. But their gravy is really really good too.

Their pizza is full of stuff, you don't have to look to get mushrooms or pepperoni! Their crust is spot on and their tomato sauce is not dripping all over, but has a great taste and compliments well the ingredients.

They changed their format a few months ago, from the booths and waitresses to a \"order at the counter\" place, but the food is still very good, so I don't care!"}
{"text":"I've visited twice over the years, both times for poutine.  I've had poutine at other restaurants, more of the national chain variety, and hands-down, this is the BEST!  They offer it with curds (traditional) or au gratin (grated cheese) and I've sampled each, preferring the au gratin by the slightest margin.  This past trip, I also tried their pizza and it's excellent; packed with toppings, cheese, and the right amount of sauce (for me).  Biggest downside is the difficulty in finding street parking but as long as you're willing to parallel park and possibly walk a bit, this place is a must!"}
