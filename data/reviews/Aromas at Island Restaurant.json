{"text":"I'm actually a big fan of hole-in-the-wall restaurants hidden away in hard to find nooks and crannies, and Aromas didn't let me down!  The decor is cheap, the fluorescent lighting makes you feel like you're sitting at the DMV, and the evening techno ballads from the adjacent martial arts shop mixed with the restaurant's Bollywood music makes you wonder if you're in Gilbert or an after-hours club in Mumbai (I guess Islamabad would be more fitting in this case).  I arrived about 20 minutes until closing and was quite grateful that the restaurant owner invited me to come in and have a seat.  Since it's Ramadan, I tried out the evening buffet which was a bit small but still had about 6 or 7 meat and veggie dishes.  Honestly, I can't remember the names of all the dishes but all I can say is they were good, but oh so freakin' spicy!  I'm a glutton for punishment when it comes to spicy food, but several of the dishes carried such a kick that I was reminded of the time one of the cooks at Cyclo went nuclear on my Pad Thai!  Thankfully, there was enough mango lassie and buttery naan to keep me from weeping profusely and throwing in the towel.  I would recommend Aromas if you're looking for a break from the norm.  The menu offers Halal and Vegetarian entr√©es at an affordable price, and the service was good.  The decor has much to be desired, but I usually give tasty food a priority over accommodations.  ;)"}
{"text":"just found aromas last night, really good stuff all and all and helpful staff was great. the only reason i cant go 5 stars is because of the setting and the plate presentation. if they made it a little more comfortable and presented their dishes to be a little more pleasing to the eye i would go 5."}
{"text":"Alexis and I have been looking for a replacement for Jewel of the Crown of old.   After many years we have found one.  No - we haven't found it's replacement, we found one that is better; much better!  Here is how the food goes: The Naan (traditional and garlic) is great! Aloo Tikki is the best that I have had anywhere! I am not normally a fan of the Paneer but even I thought it was good. Chicken Tikka Masala was great!  Normally I am a fan of a much creamer version but I have been converted.  This was so good, we got an order to go for the next day. Lastly, their Chicken Tikka reminds me of just how good this dish is supposed to be! We also ordered a side of rice and some ice teas and they also were good.  They make everything from scratch so be prepared to spend 20-30 minutes waiting on the food.  Iced Tea costs $1 per glass so no free refills.  A much better deal than spending $2.75 at other places.  This old adage of \"the hole in the wall family restaurants are the best!\" holds true.   In our opinion, this place is one of the best restaurants and absolutely the best when it comes to Pakistani/Indian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Alert... Alert.... Alert.... Boowee...Boowee...Booweee. Something has happened! Something has happened!  I have never seen any place take a dive this fast and this is coming from a man has seen The Hunt for Red October a million-zillion times.  So I was cooling out, maxin and relaxin and I thought \"I am going to go and get my Aroma's on\".   I rolled up, check my shades and entered the establishment. The sweet and mousy waitress from my first few visits was there and I knew something was up from the moment that I walked in.  She had the thousand yard stare, she looked right through me.  Since my last visit she must have seen things that would ruin even the most hardened of people.  McCain, that pussy, he ain't got shit on this girl. She knows pain. What could have happened?  She took my order and charged my card.  Then I waited, and I waited some more. Then just when I thought that I was done waiting, I waited some more. It took a full thirty minutes to get my takeout order.  I would have said something. But what do you say to someone who is clearly on the edge?  My food finally comes. I leave. I get home. I put on the Daily Show. I open the container.   My chicken curry contains exactly 3 pieces of chicken.    Monkey Balls!  What?  It took them 30 minutes to cook 3 chicken nuggets in a Curry Sauce?   Dive! Dive! Dive!  Then I ate the little tiny pieces of meat. I realized then that they were mostly bone and not a big bone that you could actually separate the meat from.  It almost seemed as if they actually cracked chicken bones up into splinters and then jammed them into the meat.  It was like an Indian version of the ol' razor in the apple trick. I took a bite and chewed and right before I swallowed I felt the knife like bone get stuck in my throat. I panicked, \"Oh no! Chicken bones are bad for dogs, Therefore, they must be horrible for humans!\" I start to really panic. I cough, I drink, I swallow,  and I jam my fingers down my throat.  This is how I am going to die, watching The Daily Show and choking to death on a chicken bone.  I soon regained my composure and got over the chicken bone. I managed to choke it down, literaly.  It  is currently making its way through my digestive system, and I  hope no update will follow.    Just then the sweats hit me.  This food hit my gut and made it feel like a bunch of hippies had eaten the brown acid and then were dancing around in my stomach and on top of my soul.   I truly felt horrible. I curled up in bed and attempted to sleep on the evil that had invade my body.  The good news is that I lived to write this review.  The bad news is that there is a rogue chicken bone lose inside my body.  Aroma's what happened? You used to be so good.  You used to make me happy on the inside.  I fear you are in your death throws.  I wonder what little restaurant you will become next."}
{"text":"Establishment -- hole-in-the-wall, very low key setting but can be improved.  Don't like the plastic covering on the tables... looks dirty and the hot serving dishes sticks to it!  Service -- good.  We came in around 5ish and since it's Ramadan, we figured that's the reason why the place was empty.  Food -- very cheap compared to other Indian restaurants I've been to.  Plain naan was good although we preferred the Garlic better but pretty small though.  Chicken Tikka Masala was not as creamy as I've had at other Indian restaurants.  Beef curry was ok.  But for what we paid (about $7 per person), can't complain.  If you really want good Indian food and don't mind paying a little bit more, check out Guru Palace on Gilbert & Baseline."}
