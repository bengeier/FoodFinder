{"text":"according to wikipedia, the definition of a dive bar is as follows:

A dive bar, or simply a dive, is a drinking establishment (or sometimes a restaurant) with a dated or ramshackle appearance and atmosphere. In a dive bar, the drinks tend to be cheap and of low quality.

The term \"dive\" dates from the London of the 19th Century when younger gentlemen wanted somewhere slightly more risqu to spend their afternoons than the great clubs frequented by their father. They formed more informal clubs where they smoked and drank coffee.

People tend to frequent dives for the sole purpose of drinking (or sometimes eating) inexpensively and sometimes there are frequent patrons who appreciate the laid-back atmosphere. [1] Dive bars often have outdoor commercial signage that appears dated.

The Shorter Oxford Dictionary indicates that in the U.S in the 1880's, it referred to an illegal drinking den or place of low repute, especially in a cellar or similar place. It has also been used to refer to opium dens. More recently, in Canada at least, it is associated with cheap and nasty accommodations (fleabag motels, run-down rooming houses and the like), as well as with prostitution and other seedy or illegal activities.

this is especially funny when i think about the shamrock, because of that back room.

the back room at the shamrock leaves me baffled.  there you are, in a bar, a \"dive bar\" if you will, but you're sitting in wicker furniture with plastic covering the tables like grandma would have.  there's bookshelves with actual books (to read?  for display?  i'm not really sure), there's dart boards on walls that look like an irish family kitchen.  it's such an odd mixture of old irish grandma and dirty ol' bar, that you can't help but be overwhelmed by it's amazingness.

the shamrock is the gathering place for all big get togethers.  good bye parties, birthday parties, welcome back that city didn't work out parties, etc etc.  the drinks are decently priced (as the definition says it should be) and the bartenders are nice.

a neighborhood bar with an irish flare for good times.  

and a weird twilight zone room to enjoy with all your friends."}
{"text":"Horrible.. Generic salad,food not the same as described on the menu. My husband and I were so disappointed. We went once before and it was delicious. They charged a two dollars more than last week and it was horrible. Last week it was all the sauces are home made, aoli, ketchup etc.. Tonight it was out of a bottle..The coleslaw was inedible. I told the server this and she said \" I have heard  that tonight\" Yet no attempt to rectify  the situation..  DO NOT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"Went here only once and the place was dead on a weekday night. Why only two stars? On my only visit, there was only one tap which was broken. They were also out of great lakes [minutes later, the bartender did find one way in the back of the fridge..]. I just ordered a st. pauli's instead, and the bartender told me I had the honor of having the last one in the bar, with a born on date of July 2008. 
On the plus side, there's about 4 hdtv's, plenty of seating [booths and tables], a pool table, and a bags arcade game. Liquor selection looked like tons of Three Olives and Smirnoff. 

There was a menu, although I didn't check it out."}
{"text":"The Shamrock is one of the best bars in the Cleveland area. This is the type of place you can go into pissed off and leave in a little bit better of a mood. The lighting is nice. The bartenders are cool people. It is a local crowd, well usually it is not a crowd at all, just a couple of patrons scattered around the bar. I started going here as a young man, felt like there weren't any girls ever going there, so I went to other places."}
