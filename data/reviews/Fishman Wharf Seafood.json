{"text":"????  Lobster combo"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals we ever had. We came as a group of five (including my 90 year old grandpa with a small appetite) and ordered the Alaska king crab and lobster set for $288 (before tax and tip) recommended for 4 people and there was plenty of food to go around. We all went home perfectly satisfied.   The set came with:  -fishman house soup (braised with pork, chicken feet and ginseng or some type of similar tasting root)  -6lb Alaska king crab cooked four ways (fried with a creamy buttery cheese sauce, steamed with garlic and scallions, braised in a sake sauce, and fried rice with crab tomalley)  -4lb deep fried lobster Hong Kong style topped with loads of fried garlic and green onions -stir fried snow pea leaves topped with garlic -fishman house dessert  -black sesame balls   We were surprised at the variety of dishes that were made out of the one 6lb crab that we ordered and how much there was to go around. Everything was delicious. My only complaint is that the food came out super fast (I eat really slow) so at times I felt a little rushed to keep up so I could enjoy the food while it was still hot.   The service was amazing. The staff were super attentive and would change our plates quite frequently and would clear or downsize the large serving plates in perfect timing. They were very nice and answered our questions. We had no issues communicating  in English.   We came on a Saturday night and called the night before to make a reservation. I believe there are 2 seating times for dinner reservations : 6pm and 8pm (or 830, I can't remember). We came in for 6 and were done by 7:30.   The restaurant was full and quite loud. It is a bit of a tight squeeze between tables, but we didn't have any issues. The staff have practice maneuvering the space.  The menu is quite large and we didn't go through it throughly as we knew we wanted crab and lobster, but they also had shark fin, geoduck, sea cucumber and fish on the menu included in other sets.   We really were not sure what to expect given there were only 9 reviews on Yelp and we were pleasantly surprised. Our experience definitely surpassed all expectations and we are looking forward to our next opportunity to come back."}
{"text":"went there for a birthday dinner last week. The place was busy, with many large tables already started eating.   Ordered lobster & crab set dinner. The food came relatively quick. However, most of the dishes were salty enough to make everyone drink water or tea. The lobster after cooking did not feel worth its weight before cooking, and the extra charges for the ??? style, was not worth it, due to the lack of ingredients. All other dishes were just average, and a bit salty.  The service was good though, which earned the  place an additional star.  IMO, Fisherman Wharf lost its touch when compared to Fisherman Club down the street."}
{"text":"'Asia Food Fest' is kind of like summerlicious/winterlicious, runs for 2 weeks, April 29 - May 15. I called in mid 2 weeks prior to book a table STATING CLEARLY that I want to book a table for 4 for the Asia Food Fest. My resrevations was for 6pm on April 30. I called in on the same day in the afternoon to confirm the booking and said that it is for the 'Asia Food Fest'. The lady who picked up the phone said 'okok, sure, see you tonight'  travelling all the way from downtown, after 1.5 hours of commuting, I finally arrived at the place. They sat us down and gave us the menu. I told the server I am getting the 'asia food fest' menu and she looked at me confused then walked away without saying anything. Then after a good 5 mins another waiter came over and said 'we are not offering that menu'. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU ARE NOT OFFERING THAT MENU???? I CLEARLY CALLED 3 HOURS PRIOR TO MY BOOKING TO CONFIRM AND THAT PERSON DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING. I asked to speak with the manager, the server's response was 'doesn't matter who you speak with, the answer is going to be the same, we are NOT offering that menu'. HOW RUDE CAN YOU BE??!?!? I mean why can't I speak with your manager, whats the problem with that???   Anyways after a lengthy conversation, I FINALLY get to speak with the manager. I asked him about the asia food fest menu and he said they are not offering it anymore and asked WHERE I saw the menu (I showed him the pic of the menu I took with my phone) I told him I found it online and he said they are not participating in this event anymore. I asked him WHY he didn't bother calling me to inform me ahead of time so at least I know and I do not have to waste my time going all the way uptown. He said he didn't know I booked for that menu, that is CLEARLY BS because when I first called in to make the reservation AND when I called to confirm the reservation, I mentioned BOTH TIMES that I am coming for that menu and BOTH TIMES the staff did NOT say anything about not offering it anymore.   The manager isn't willing to do anything either, he bascially told us to either order from the normal menu or leave. HE WAS STRAIGHT UP RUDE TO CUSTOMERS. anyways me and my other 3 friends decided to leave and just eat at another place.   SUPER RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE, NEVER EVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. ..food was presented nicely but no flavor whatsoever.  Either the chef has no sense of taste or careless. Will not return and will not recommend it to anyone. ???????,????????                              ????       Should be no star."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch one day after Christmas. Ordered the 6 lbs lobster and 2.5 Vancouver crab combo. The lobster was cooked in 3 ways, some cooked with noodles, some boiled in congee with sea cucumber, most of the lobster body was cooked in Hong Kong style. The crab was cooked in 2 ways, deep fried with maggie sauce and Feng Sha style. The presentation was eye-catching with big plates and nice garnish. I have to say the dishes tasted even better than they looked. It was an truly delicious experience. I would recommend it for family or friends gathering because the menu are mostly combos for 4 people or more."}
{"text":"One of the best seafood dinners I have ever had. Period.  I came here with my family on Friday night (9 people plus a baby) and we ordered the lobster and crab combo (for 6-7 people)  and it was more than enough food for everyone.  It comes with a fresh 8lb lobster and an 8lb king crab each of which is served over multiple courses. They choose the lobster and crab from the aquarium and show it to you table side for pictures and approval before cooking, which was very cool and kind of scary.  Among the courses was a lobster sashimi, fried lobster with duck egg, broiled king king crab legs and several others. I think maybe 10 courses in total. I'll upload pictures soon because the descriptions don't even do it justice.  Overall the bill came up to about $500 INCLUDING tax and tips, which I think is incredible value for the type of meal we had and the fact we had 9 adults and a baby.  I forgot to mention they give everyone disposable plastic gloves so that you can eat with your hands, which is always my preferred method of eating shellfish."}
{"text":"Upgrading my review to 5 stars because the food is that good, lol! Came back a second time, this time for dinner, and ordered the same set. We were with visitors and wanted a higher, 'more impressive' lobster mountain' so instead of having the lobster cooked 4 ways, the server suggested we cook it 3 ways, perfect! :D We chose to have the lobster claws cooked with (duck) yolk and it was soooo delicious!!   The service was as friendly and fast as when we came for lunch. There's only 2 seatings for dinner so make sure you make a reservation before coming in."}
{"text":"Came here with my family a few weeks ago and everything we ordered was really delicious.   Pros. Very very good food. Every dish was huge and nicely played and was mouth wateringly good.  I like how they provide gloves so you can keep your hands clean!   Cons.  The place is really small, all the tables are crammed very close together, you can barely move around between tables and I am a skinny person! Always packed and busy so you'll definitely need a reservation. I've been turned away before because I didn't have a reservation.   Overall, I would definitely go back over and over but you'll need a hefty wallet as it can get quite expensive but I think it is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is basically like the Fishman Lobster Clubhouse. Whereas FLC gets 5 stars, this place would be 5.5 or get one more star.  1. The crabs and lobsters are cooked in more ways than at FLC.   2. Flavor wise if they are both similar, I think this place is better because of the variety.   3. At FLC, they always try to upset you, not here.   4. The place is smaller and more cozy, nicer decor too, and you don't have aquarium surrounding you with hundreds of sea creatures watching you eat their friends and families."}
{"text":"the other reviewer is right!! We cAmerican in at 11am. The food was served at 11:50am. That was only because I asked the server where was my food at 11: 45am. Don't come here if you are hungry or if you have kids...."}
{"text":"how it works -you select the lobster/crab u want for dinner -they kill it and make about 6 different dishes out of it -enjoy!  This place definitely isn't cheap, but if it's for a large party and/or a special then it's worth the price when you calculate it per person."}
{"text":"This is my second time going here! The food quality is amazing!! I went there on the weekend, and without making a reservation they were able to put me on the patio because that day it was very busy. I ordered the lobster and Alaska Crab. These are the best seafood dishes I've had in Canada, it's very fresh! Cooking the dish and bring it out it very fast, there was so much I had to bring home almost half of the dishes to save for later. The only problem is they only accept canadian debit or cash."}
{"text":"Best price and best flavors I ever have. Way better than HK. I definitely will return next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Best seafood I had and it was cheap!!! 6 lb lobster 2 lb crab shark fin soup .. What more can I ask for??!!!!"}
{"text":"Some parts of the lobster was not cooked completely like the claws were raw. The fried oyster was not that fresh. But the fried rice and geoduck sashimi was very good"}
{"text":"A very good experience. I've been to Fisherman's Clubhouse as well but liked this one better. Nicer staff and environment without any commotion unlike Clubhouses. Although price per a head was about the same I think you get more value here. Side dishes are a good portion unlike Clubhouse. The house fried rice was surprisedly good with little chunks of what I think were minced fried mussels. We ordered 12 pounds of lobster and 6 side dishes and it was more then enough for 9 people. We had a couple of small take out boxes at the end. Worked out to less the $50 a head (tax and tip in). The only negative (but barely that) was the complimentary soup was chicken stock with ginseng with a ton of chicken feet (approximately 10) with barely any chicken meat. Seems odd to include the feet in the soup for what is a nicer more expensive restaurant. Suggestion: Skip the feet and the soup is still a nice starter."}
{"text":"Had my mom's birthday dinner here. Had a pre fixe dinner with soup, lobster, King crab, fish,  and rice. The food was just mediocre. Not very flavourful. Service wasn't the greatest. The restaurant is pretty tight. I would rather spend my money at Fishmen club house."}
{"text":"Great service, reasonable wait time on Mother's Day, good quality seafood.  We had the fried lobster, shark fin soup, fried lobster, lobster fried rice, snow pea tips, fried oyster, and chicken.  This was one of their set dinners. All in all it cost us $335 after tax and tip for a party of 5.   Great place to take your family for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I went to this Chinese Restaurant for lunch today on the recommendation of a friend. Unfortunately the friend wasn't very hungry, so, I had to eat most of the meal. The portions are quite large: however; when the going gets tough, the tough get going. My lobster was very good. I tried shark fin soup for the first time and can understand why it is popular with Chinese customers. One of the other customers that I recognized today, is the owner of a chain of lower priced Congee restaurants.  This is a high end seafood restaurant primarily catering to Chinese customers. I was told that it is very busy at night but not at lunch. Do not come alone, because the portions are large. It is best to come here in a large group and to share the meal. The live Alaska King Crabs that I saw were huge. I will have to come back in a large group and try one. The crab (as was my lobster) well be cooked in different styles.  This restaurant is not for everyone; however, I am glad that I ate here."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was okay. Some were better than the others.   Service was rushed as the food came in faster than we could eat them. The food that were here but couldnt fit were just left on the table next to us left to be cold."}
{"text":"Great canton style seafood restaurant, every time ensure freshness and great selection by the combo including veggie dish and quality dessert at a fair price. Have a craving for seafood you cannot go wrong with it and great service too. Taste is always good even free appetizers are cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"If you like seafood, you'll likely enjoy this place very much (probably won't be a low budget meal though).   I came here with about a table of 9 and we basically ordered all seafood dishes. Highlights of the meal:   Lobster - I can't tell if it was fresh or not to be honest, all you taste is the seasoning and the fried batter they make it in.   Alaskan crab legs - they stack it in a tower and you can choose how you want it cooked. I believe we tried it in steamed and fried. I personally enjoyed the fried version a lot when it was fresh but the steamed one is very refreshing and on a lighter note in comparison   Lobster fried rice - I thought this was average as they just basically cover it in sauce.   Fried tong yuen - deep fried balls of goodness with black sesame filling. These went super fast at the table and it was overall enjoyable.   Pumpkin sago - I thought this was unique as I've never seen pumpkin as the base for sago tong shui. However I quite enjoyed it after a heavy meal of seafood ! It wasn't overly sweet which was a bonus.   Verdict: As someone who usually dislikes shellfish type seafood because of its fishy taste and textures, I feel that this is worth a try with a big group !"}
{"text":"We're tourists from Chicago looking for a memorable chinese seafood meal. Was told this place is good. Did my due diligence on Yelp. Forewarned, I visited the ATM machine in the morning for cash and worked up a big appetite.  Arrived for lunch. Not immediately impressed by the mall location, but I was pleased to see empty lobster packing cases stacked up outside the front door. The decor is typical Hong Kong  banquet, very red, but clean and heck, we're there to eat.  The weekday lunch crowd was, as expected sparse. They had a maybe 6-10 dishes for $7 to $12, but lobster starts at $56 per person. We weren't there for broccoli beef and fried rice. It's FISH ON!   I was ready to order that lobster lunch, but saw a multi-course dinner for three at $159 on the set menu. I remember these dishes,... Fried 5 pounds of lobster, Calimari and snap peas. Honey oysters. Beef ribs, SS Pork. Eel in black bean sauce. Clams in rice porridge. We didn't get the Tomalley fried rice,  Someone had asked for rice early in the meal.  You never do that at a chinese banquet meal, so I told the waiter not to bring rice. He took me literally, I was full to to the gills later anyway. Wouldn't have touched that rice.  At Chinese banquet style places like this, the owners put service secondary to the food. It's Asian-take-your-time. Not an issue when you're eating 3000 calories, as you don't want them bring the food out fast, There was only one waitress, but we were one party eating at 2PM. We got drinks, extra utensils, and the check when needed. Although I already know it, the waitress told us about the 10% service charge. So taxes and tip pushed the bill to $199 CDN for the three of us. That's $150 USA, what I have spent for three at Ruth Chris for lunch. Man, this was just as good.  Would I do this often? Hey, I'm from the USA. Just being up North and not having to hear about Trump is worth celebrating every day. We'll come back when we're up here again."}
{"text":"Amazing Seafood I ordered the crab and lobster combo for 4 but there was only 2 of us I had leftovers for two extra people which I brought home the lobster and crab was amazing the second dish of the king crab the steamed dish was amazing desert was also amazing and the manager Elwis is awesome I would recommend this place for anyone looking for amazing lobster and king crab establishment I cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"Came here for cny eve dinner. Restaurant didn't seem to be that busy. Service was pretty good but food wise I did not enjoy much. Seasoning was lacking that night compare to other times I've been here. Could be because I haven't came back for a while. Order lobster sashimi which came on a bed of ice cube which started to melt. You were pretty much fishing for lobster. The restaurant tired to be fancy and used nitrogen at the bottom but it was pretty much gone by the time the serve got to my table. Eel was very good but it didn't come with a whole fish pretty much a slice each. Pork ribs was my favourite out of the whole meal which is pretty sad when your at a seafood restaurant"}
{"text":"I had a late dinner with my parents here recently (around 8:00pm on a Friday).  We had a huge lobster and we were still talking about it days later!  We had a 4.26 pound lobster Hong Kong Style ($16/lb) and while we ordered the Scallop and Egg White fried rice ($13) we actually received the Lobster Tomalley fried rice (which was $12 on the menu, but we were charged $13 since that was the price of the fried rice that we ordered - more about that later).    So at these types of restaurants if you don't order their set menus and you order your lobster à la carte you tell them how many pounds you want (we said 4 pounds) and then they get a lobster from the tank, take it to the back and weigh it, then bring the live lobster to your table with the weight sticker stuck onto the body and ask you if you are ok with that lobster (this is how I know the exact weight of our lobster).  If you are, they take it to the kitchen and fry it up.  So Hong Kong style is chopped up lobster, battered and deep fried.  The batter is slightly spicy and there's lots of fried garlic and green onions.  It's topped with shredded carrots.  It also comes with tiny deep fried fish sprinkled over the lobster.  Some places will charge extra for Hong Kong style, but this restaurant didn't.     The lobster came on a pretty platter and piled up high like a mountain.  It was so tasty.  The flavouring was great - not too salty and it had a nice spicy kick.  The fried garlic and tiny fish were so crispy and crunchy.  The lobster was perfect.  When I first started eating the fried rice, I was like \"where are the scallops?\"  It wasn't until I hit a big chunk of fried tomalley that I realized they had given us the wrong dish.  By that time we had already eaten a good amount of it and it was good, so we didn't say anything.  Then when the bill came, it was late and since it was only a dollar that they overcharged us by, we didn't want to make a fuss, so we just paid it without mentioning it.  The fried rice that we received was tasty, but it was a little too oily/greasy for my liking (but fried rice tends to be that way).  It came nicely presented, moulded into a pyramid.  It also came with some baby bok choy at the base of the pyramid.  Oh, I forgot to mention that they gave us some complimentary soup at the start of the meal.  It was chicken feet in broth (!).  It was way too freaky for me, so I didn't eat it.  My parents (who are much more adventurous when it comes to eating more unconventional things than I am) liked it.  They said the bones were so soft, it was like eating sardines (something else I don't like, so that didn't sell me on it at all, haha).  They also gave us complimentary dessert which was a sweet mung bean soup.  It was ok.  It wasn't overly sweet.        The restaurant wasn't that busy when we arrived and was pretty empty when we left.  They asked us if we wanted to sit at the table for 3 at the front of the restaurant right by the door and since it was cold we asked for another table.  There were plenty of empty tables so they actually gave us a big round table for 6-8 with a Lazy Susan at the centre.  The restaurant has a regal feel to it with the décor reminding me of Chinese Emperor kind of things.  All chairs have chair coverings that are red with embroidered yellow flowers.  It's not formal though, all patrons (including us) were wearing casual clothing.  Service is competent, but not exactly friendly (no smiles or warmness).  Staff also stand around and chat with each other or just stare at you when they have nothing to do.  However, they come when you call for them.  I really like how they bring boxes to your table and transfer your food into the boxes right in front of you when you ask to take the remainder of your food home.     The washrooms are very clean and modern looking.    There's lots of free parking.      I would definitely come back for the lobster!"}
{"text":"Updated review - 3.5  Food still great but service needs work.   First time back this year and it was crazy busy for dinner. Reservations are a must, as I saw a couple of walk-in customers turned away at the door.  We ordered the King crab and Geoduck combo that feeds 6-8 ppl. There were only 5 of us, but we devoured all the food. The only food we took home was half of the crab fried rice.  The $398 combo included:  7 lbs king crab made 3 ways: - body steamed with truffle - legs fried hk style - crab fried rice  They didn't have the 2 lbs geoduck which was normally what they served. The smallest they had was 5lbs which costed an extra $120. That was served 2 ways: - sashimi  - gal bladder was deep fried  The dinner also included a huge bowl of chicken soup, scallops with snow peas, steamed fish, spareribs & snow peas in fish soup. Dessert was meh.  Typical Chinese style. Didn't bother taking pics because by that time I was too stuffed!!  This time around I found that service was not as great as in the past. It's like the servers mastered the art of never making eye contact with the customers. We had to ask a couple of times to have the plates changed, because they were loaded with crab shells and fish bones.   $630 was the total bill after tax & tip. I guess it was worth the experience, as I've never had geoduck sashimi before.   We'll be back again."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of these places before, but this is place was the best that I have been.   First off, the food is very fresh. They bring the seafood to your table to see the freshness of the animal. Once you have verified that the food is fresh, it is taken to the back to be cooked. The seafood is very sweet to the taste as it is extremely fresh.   The difference between this location and other locations is that it feels that we get more bang for our buck. For example, with the crab legs, we go two dishes. They explained that it is because the legs are extremely long. They have to split it into two dishes for us. Yet at other places, there is just one dish. The portions are the same size, but at other places, it is just one dish.   Looking at the decor, it is a standard Chinese restaurant. Nothing special. The only difference is that we can see the seafood in the tanks. It is a huge attraction for the kids.   Service can improve. They were not very friendly. Some of the staff had attitude. Thus, they lost a star here."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Chicago just to eat here!!! Super worth the drive!! I try to go twice a year!! The owner is super nice and friendly!! Can't wait to go back in the fall!!"}
{"text":"Went for a special birthday for a group. Wanting seafood and a great meal. The original choice was the other fisherman lobster villa, but they were booked up so we thought this one would do. We ordered the one with the lobster and the king crab dinner set meal which serves 8-10 people.   The king crab (which was what I was looking forward to  most) was as good as I had hoped for.  The meat was sticking to the shell in steamed and hk style. The version that was cooked with egg wasn't good.  The lobster was made hk style and the little fishies (sorry don't know the name) that were served with the lobster were very big and not good.  The lobster itself was fresh and pretty good.   All of the other dishes in the meal were smaller than what I would expect given the price of the meal. There were a few people in the group (10) that were still hungry after the dinner.  I wouldn't really recommend this place unless you want to save a few bucks on seafood."}
{"text":"Food was decent but before we can enjoy our king crab feast. We had little critters in our soup.  Also, there was a strand of hair in our crab.    Bad: Fried oysters  Good: King crab, ribs, steamed fish, fried rice, sprouts, little sesame balls at the end  Bottomline: Food was decent not great for the price. Critters and hair in our soup and crab is not acceptable. I would not come back for these reasons."}
{"text":"My parents were super excited to come here for lunch. It's because it's an excellent price for hordes of food, seafood to be exact. But with only 4 people, it was SO MUCH FOOD.   What they offer is fresh crab, lobster, or fish. Set menus range from $48 (2 people) to $400 or more (for 10 people). You'll pay extra if you want Alaskan King Crab rather than the small Vancouver King Crab. Nonetheless, they take all parts of the crab or lobster and make a meal out of it.   The Vancouver Crab meal comes with Congee, crab knuckles, braised crab head and claws, and e-fu noodles. Although it said it was for 2 people. it was more than enough food for the 4 of us. Parents also wanted a lobster, and made sense to get another $48 meal and take the rest home. Comes with also congee, noodles and a whole lobster.It's a lot of food.   The menu is a bit confusing. They have the set menu, but also a la carte at the back. On the set menu they say you'll get a 2.5 lb crab. On the a la carte menu, it says king crab (doesn't say what kind) is $16/lb. If you do the math, the $48 meal sounds really appealing.  They come and show you the crab you're going to get. They ONLY had a 2lb crab (instead of 2.5) and they could make it up by giving us another 2 lb and adding another $26 to the meal! when we refused and asked for a substitute, it was a big deal.   Fun for the entire family, espeically if in the mood for seafood."}
{"text":"First time here. The food is isn't bad . Some dishes is very good but some dishes are not. Especially the fried rice was too greasy. At the end of the course the desert was good. I would give a 4 star but I have 3 star and will not come again because they didn't accept credit card. Restaurant like this should take credit card because it's not cheap. Who the hell carry $1000 dollar all the time?"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese seafood place in the heart of Markham. Lobsters, Geoducks sashimi, crabs and all that kind of luxury. It is expensive, but it does look nice when you bring people out.  Went there with a few family members, ordered a huge meal, here's the breakdown.  Manila Clams cooked in rice wine: Sweet clams boiled in decent quality rice wine. It brings out the flavour of the seafood while infusing the broth with the clam flavour. Not my favourite thing, I enjoy more high impact flavours, but it is a decent rendition of the dish.  Chicken and Jellyfish Salad: Cold strand of pulled free-range chicken mixed with Jellyfish. It could have had a stronger flavour profile, with more sesame or even chili oil, but I suspect it was done on purpose to showcase the freshness and the quality of the ingredients. It was a solid dish.  Stir fried eel in XO sauce: Delicious, smokey, fresh. One of the surprises of the meal. The fish was super flaky, the flavour was on point.   Crab stir fried in salted egg: Super flavourful, quite salty, as salted eggs tend to be, the sweetness of the shellfish really pulls through. It was quite a delicious dish.  Typhoon shelter lobster: The piece of resistance, this gigantic lobster is delicious. It is not dried up, which stir fried lobster this size tend to be, and packed with garlic, chives, and fried anchovies, which were full of umami. The glorious lobster pulled through and we devoured it.  Greens with katsuobushi: Fad, the katsuobushi fell on the side and didn't provide any flavouring whatsoever. They were added almost as an afterthought. They also added goji berries for some reason.   Stir fried Filet mignon with walnuts: I don't know why we ordered this, didn't bring anything to the sequence of the meal, but it wasn't bad per say. I totally forgot about it.  Roe fried rice: Delicious and full of wok Hai, did his job as a sauce mopper and as the meal's startch.  Fried rice with shark fin: My relative ordered it. It was plain terrible. Soupy, heavy and didn't taste like anything. Plus the actual ethical dilemma of eating shark fin was rendered moot by the fact they were barely any. It was like a bad cross over of a congee and a fried rice without any of the qualities of neither. For the price you might expect better.  Would return, I give this place a solid 3.5."}
{"text":"Nicer digs, for a Chinese restaurant. Quality of food was very good, price is on the higher end but reasonable - $400 for 10 people after tax & tip in a no-booze meal that included ample lobster and crab. A number of seafood items are deep fried, but this does not detract from the savoury shellfish inside, though purists of the \"no deep-frying good seafood\" school may disagree. It's decadent food, delicious. Sadly has shark fin on the menu and the wall so that will disappoint ethical foodies. We don't eat shark fin, and it was disappointing to see it on offer."}
{"text":"If you don't wanna go big at this restaurant (i.e. don't wanna spend a ton of money here), you may consider the following dishes (not combo; ordered individually) for a party of 4:  1. A 5 lb lobster (at $18/lb atm) - $88 2. OPTIONAL: Add $10 to make the lobster to be cooked in 2 ways - see pic  3. Add $10 for lobster tomalley fried rice  4. Greens (dao miu) with garlic - definitely opt for the choy sum instead, the dao miu stems were gigantic /old - $15 5. Half a chicken $13 - meat texture was just so-so *Complimentary soup (pork with ginseng) and dessert which were both quite good!"}
{"text":"3.5  Came on a Thursday night during peak dinner hours. Didn't make a reservation in advance. Thankfully, we only had to wait about five minutes. Not so fortunately, we had to sit at a table attached to someone else's table. I don't mean that we shared a table. What I mean is that this place is a fire hazard. The tables are really close together. Our table for four was pushed right up against someone else's table for four. We weren't asked whether we wanted to join that other table. The result of this, I'll write about later.  Had: Set meal for $108 (supposedly feeds three), + bowl of white rice. 3 braised soups? - These come as hot as can be. Inside each container (enough soup to feed at least two people) was a couple pieces of lean pork, a variety of Chinese herbs and veggies, and a chicken foot. The soup was sweet in a very cleansing way, and it was also very savory. Good stuff. 3 deep fried oysters with honey pepper sauce - Good sized oysters. Interesting presentation (separated by asparagus spears and cherry tomato halves. Batter on the oysters wasn't as light as I'd have liked it, and the oysters were slightly overcooked. Eel with dried tangerine peel with yellow wine sauce - Clean tasting dish. Eel was lovely and fresh. Also very well cooked. At least six pieces, if not eight. Sauce was really good. Subtle on the tangerine peel. Garlicy. Yum. Lobster in Hong Kong style? Whichever style is the one with the bits of deep fried garlic and little white fishes. 3 lbs. - Not as much of the deep fried bits as Fishman Lobster Clubhouse. Also not presented as nicely. Deep fried garlic still had that bitter, raw garlic taste. Lobster not as tasty as Fishman Lobster Clubhouse. Not as crispy. Not as well fried. Still tender though. And sweet. Still good, but not the best. Clam and lobster tomalley rice in soup? - Something like that. We got oysters instead of clams. They made the substitute without telling us. We didn't upgrade. I'm fine with that. Good amount of oysters (although you might want to make sure that you stir around the bowl before serving. My mom scooped from the top for me, and my bowl was very heavy in oysters, but that left considerably less oysters for other people). Not so much lobster tomalley (aka lobster roe). I believe it was deep fried before being added. Small bits of Chinese shitake mushrooms in here as well. Rice in soup is one of my favorite things. This one was done well. Really good broth. Chinese veggies in fish broth - Veggies were sweet and fresh and a lovely green color. Good portion for three or four people. Some kind of steamed fish - I'm not into steamed fish, but this one was done really well. Fish was tender. They separate the fish from most of the back bone, but there are still some small bones in there, so be careful. I was going to take a picture, but the waitress dumped the soy sauce (which had been in a wine glass on the plate of steamed fish) onto our fish before I could. Red bean sweet soup - sweeter than most red bean sweet soups I've had, but pretty good. I'm not a fan of red bean.  The food deserves at least a four. The service is meh. The ambiance leaves much to be desired, and it affects the service. As mentioned at the beginning of this review, we had to sit right next to another party of four. I had to sit next to a 9-month old in a high chair. I like kids, and this one and I had a fairly good time together, but I was eating, and she was trying to get my attention...which meant she was hitting my arm. Had I not been fond of children, I could see that being highly...awkward. When paying, tips are included in the bill. When the waiter returned our change to us, he left it at the table next to ours (the one we were attached to). Um...yeah. I see that being a problem too.  On the downside, we could have gotten shorted of a fairly large amount of change because of the way the tables in this place are set up. On the upside, our $108 set meal + bowl of white rice could have fed 6. We have half of our lobster + other leftovers, and we came as a party of 4. I'd come again, but probably with a considerably larger party so that I don't have to share tables with other people. Until next time!"}
{"text":"There were 12 of us and we were seated in a private room (with its own washroom!).   The food was truly delicious - it was my first time eating seafood this way out of the house - piles and piles of mainly seafood (other dishes were meats and veggies) that we were able to chow down on armed with gloved hands (gloves provided).   We came for a birthday dinner (hey, Cindy!) and were treated with a large variety of dishes - crab cooked four ways and lobster cooked four ways. Definitely recommend this set of dishes for a wholesome experience. The seafood came fried, seasoned sweet, seasoned salty, etc. The range of flavours was enough to remind yourself to keep pace with all the food.   Their sweet and sour pork was also quite amazing - presented in a pineapple dish, the pork had a nice strawberry and pineapple sauce drizzled onto it. Reminded me of funnel cakes (in the best of ways).   Service was nice until they noticed that we were eating the heads of the lobsters (which, as a tip, has a lot of meat) - then they stopped bringing the heads the next time around. They also started rushing us to get out so they could clean even though we had the table/private room booked for another hour.   Overall, it was a lovely experience for a great occasion. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to those who love seafood. I wish service was better but the quality of the food balanced it out."}
{"text":"Came here with my Chinese friends (and they had this last weekend!) in a group of 5. The owner gave us a big table for 8 people that he could've been used to accommodate a bigger group but didn't. I felt that he was a personable owner he cared about this customers although the place was packed and hectic with so much going on.   Anyways, you order from an extensive set menu for the count of people you have. We chose the one with the King Crab and Lobster with fried rice (which comes with starter soup and dessert). The staff came over after we ordered to show us the live crustaceans to show us the Market Pricing based on weight. They were HUGE and we said it was coolz.  The food presentation was amazing and it tasted sooo good. You can't go wrong with anything fried with onions and garlic. They also give out disposable plastic gloves so you can eat with your hands.   My bf and I are not fans of seafood but we thoroughly enjoyed the experience as it was super fresh and cooked to perfection. The only downside to this place would be that the price can fluctuate without warning due to market price of the seafood. We estimated at most $60 for each but came out to be $80.. I think the more people you have the more you can eat for the same price so come in a big group! I saw a table of about 15 people so I guess 8-10 people is a not a problem here."}
{"text":"One of the more inexpensive seafood restaurants, the food tastes good, visually appealing and the portions were sufficient. Because a multiple dishes are made from the same animal, I'm astonished by how many unique dishes there are, using every piece to create an artwork. Compared to the food, however, the environment, waiters, facilities, cleanness...etc. were about those of any other restaurant, the area was also small (but big enough for a private room) and holds about 5 tables (smaller ones can probably be put out for smaller groups). They even provide gloves so you don't have to wash your hands (as frequently), a good call as their bathrooms are tiny (on a side note, I find it amusing how the door to the bathrooms blend into the wall)."}
{"text":"Impressive preparation & execution of a diverse & unique shellfish feast.  We chose an 8 pound king crab & 2 four pound Maine lobsters, which were presented to us for viewing before dinner started.  We started off with a delicately prepared shark fin soup with exquisite quality \"filet\" of shark fin.  A little red vinegar added just the right piquancy.  Then came lightly breaded plump sweet fresh flash-fried oyster in a slight sweet. & sour sauce.  This was followed by steamed king crab legs in a clear broth with scallions, flash fried crab knuckles, and an impressive \"tower of lobster.\"  This was followed by steamed papaya with birds nest.  Extremely delicious & memorable.  Down side is that the only accept cash or debit cards."}
{"text":"Our party of 9 + 2 kids came for dinner on a Sunday night. Almost everyone orders a set for x number of people instead of a la carte. And each set will include things like Alaska king crab cooked different ways or various types of seafood.  They are extremely busy, so when you reserve seats, they do it in 2 sittings. You either reserve for 6pm or 8pm. Which also means that when we sat down for 6pm, they effectively kicked us out at 7:45pm. We received our dessert soup without asking and when we were not done our dishes and we received the bill along with the dessert soup.   Yes, this restaurant is known for their seafood and cooking, but the service was completely abominable and just rude. The food is a novelty for the first time and yes, the portions are huge, but you do also pay a very hefty price tag and suffer through 2 hours of awful service. Tables are crammed together and the place itself is very loud when it completely fills up.  Worth going once with relatives or for an occasion, but I'd say like that once is enough."}
{"text":"We wanted to order a set menu but it included sea cucumber and duck feet that our group couldn't eat. We asked if we could switch it with oysters but they said no. They said the only substitution would be stir fried pork, which is obviously much less in value than sea cucumber.  The deep fried lobster was cold when it came. The outside dough was too thick and flavorless. The lobster inside was overcooked and the meat was dried out.. I'm thinking they didn't even serve us the actual lobster that they showed us alive in the beginning - There wouldn't have been enough time for the lobster to get so cold even if they cooked it the moment they showed it to us.   The service was tremendously rude with the lady ignoring us, throwing food on the table, manhandling plates, giving us cut-eye, etc etc.  We were a group of 3 and I guess they knew we were having a bad time, they added 10% as 'mandatory tip'. We usually tip 15% minimum regardless so I'm glad they took the 10% instead.  We are not going back."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I've ever been to in my entire life and here are the reasons why:  1) The service is horrible, the wait staff never smiled even once and they reply with a snarky tone of voice. 2) The plating was alright for the most part but also pretty sloppy, I got a dish with the sauce dribbling all over the sides of the plate 3) Everything is a set menu, you can't even choose what you want to eat and they bundle things into these high price packages that don't make sense, they don't even let you switch out a dish for something else 4) The food is honestly mediocre at best, to be completely honest the lobster tasted just like the lobster you can get at Foody Mart or T&T for $7 - if you want lobster go to Red Lobster or something , don't waste your money on this place 5) We were seated in a HORRIBLE location, our table was right next to the party room and lemme say their walls are not soundproof, all we could here the whole meal was their cackling and squealing coming from the next room and when we asked if we could be moved they refused. 6) ALL THEY SEEM TO SERVE IS SOUP, it's like hey! lemme help you wash down that soup with more soup 7) They're \"sweet water\" tasted like fermented spoons of sugar and it's not even like we had a choice to get it or not because it came in the package! 8) They seem to serve feet with everything, e.g. their sea cucumber came with a side of a ducks foot AND they don't even serve duck! why do they have the feet????? and their \"fisherman's soup\" was filled with chicken feet   I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!"}
{"text":"Great food but very expensive. We got the King Crab and the Lobster. The presentation was nice and was well put together but I don't plan on coming back simply because the price is ridiculous."}
{"text":"4.5  This place is slightly better than Fishman Lobster. Came here last night for a huge celebration (22 people).  We ordered 4 dinner sets, 2 for each table. There was so much good food. We had several lobster dishes as well as alaskan king crab. There were 2 eel dishes that weren't great, one of them was a bit fishy. The clam in soup dish wasn't great either. The fried rice dishes were great, we had two. One with crab and one with lobster brain.  The service is a bit shotty, but it's expected at Chinese places."}
{"text":"ok me and my friend decide to come here because one of my friend recommended this place so we decided to come here order the king crabs diner set first the guy who work's there bring us the crab mention to us it was 7.21lb we said ok ,food isn't bad can't complain some service is not bad , but when we finally decided to get our check they added other $10 on my check so i asked them why we getting additional charge so they brought back the guy who was helping us with the crab Loudly with attitude said i told you guys is over weight that's why we charging you additional price ,we all said you never mention anything about additional price , he said he worked there for over 10 years he would never lie , but of cuz we see that he lie and he also get LOUD on me with attitude place isn't bad just need their staff to have a better service then this. disappointed and i would never go back.  THEY DO NOT ACCEPT ANY UNITED STATE  CREDIT CARD"}
{"text":"If you are craving for seafood, this is the place to go! I've been here a few times and prefer this place over \"Fishman Lobster House--Yu Lok Heen\". The prices here are slightly cheaper and they have better combos here compared to Yu Lok Heen. This place have the \"Sharkfin rice\" which I find it pretty unique. And they have the Vancouver Crab with Salted Egg Yolk (I don't think the other place have this, it's soooo good). I got the combo 6A which have a good mix of dishes- you get soup, 8lb King lobster, 2.5lb Vancouver Crab, Steamed Sea Bass & Deep Fried Eel, Clams, vegetables, sharkfin rice and desserts! Highly recommend this place and you must make reservations in advance!!"}
{"text":"Service is awful and slow! Avoid his place, service staff gives you dirty looks when you ask for the status of your food. The good itself is fine but not worth the slow bad service."}
{"text":"Yet another Chinese Seafood restaurant. I have tried similar restaurants like, Fishman Lobster Club House, Lobster King, Vince Seafood Restaurant and Omei. I will have to say this one is probably the best out of all the ones mentioned above in terms of food and value. Just by a small margin though.   There is good amount of seating but with a place like this its always busy during dinner. There were seven of us and we decided to get the lobster and King crab combo for $398. Both the lobster and Alaskan king crab were 8lbs each.   Started off with soup which had nice flavours and a bit sweet. Next was fried lobster arms which had a sweet sauce. Then came the fried crab legs and steamed crab legs. I liked the steamed ones better. Next came the steamed lobster tail and fried lobster claws. Then came the deep fried lobster legs and steamed bass. The fish was silky smooth and just melted in your mouth. Also noticed they took out most of the bones from the fish for you.  Next was the crab brain which I like to call it. Tasted and looked like scrambled eggs.  Then came the snow peas and pyramid fried rice with lobster brain.  Finally for dessert we go sweet black sesame balls deep fried I think and a green bean sweet soup.   Overall the food is very comparable to the other restaurants mentioned above in terms of taste and quality.   We also ordered half a chicken for about $13. When you add in tax and tip the grand total came to $510. They calculate a 10% tip automatically on the bill for you. They only take cash or debit. The best part is that they do not charge you extra if the crab or lobster were a little over the 8lbs.  On the a la cart menu the lobster is $16/ lb and the Alaskan King Crab is $40/ lb.  Service was excellent. They replaced our plates frequently because of all the crab and lobster shells. Workers speak Mandarin and can understand some Cantonese and English. Reservations is a must."}
{"text":"The first thing I asked myself when I entered this restaurant was the grammatically incorrect restaurant name. I always thought it was called Fisherman's Wharf, but apparently it's just Fishman Wharf. Okay.  With that aside...this restaurant was considerably busy even at 9pm on a Sunday, which was definitely a good sign. Seeing how this restaurant specializes in seafood, our  table of 3 went for an all-in order of anything seafood related. We ordered the shark fin soup, clams with sake, a 2.8lb lobster, and fried rice.  Everything tasted very good! The shark fin soup had very thick shark fin; just the way I like it. The clams with sake are plentiful and the sake taste was quite strong too. The 2.8lb lobster was fried and had a lot of meat, despite the fact it was only 2.8lbs. Finally, the fried rice was stacked like a pyramid and tasted very good as well.  The only drawback was the service, as it was very hard to wave someone down to take our order, request service, or even ask for the bill. By the time my table was asking for the bill the place was only 50% full, so I can't imagine how hard it would be if it was completely full...  Either way, it's nice to have an excellent restaurant that specializes in Asian seafood. I'll definitely return for future visits."}
{"text":"I've found this restaurant on yelp and was gonna give it a try but lucky when I arrived, I've asked to confirm if they take credit card first and they said no. On the yelp web page, it says this restaurant accepts credit cards. They said they've stopped accepting credit cards at least 3 years ago. Please update it on yelp that they only accept cash or debit. They'll take my American money but it's gonna be one to one ($1=1.33cad at this time) so we left."}
{"text":"First off, prices for this price is definitely on the tourist trap level...but I still recommend it for special occasions. When you walk in, walls are filled with glass fish tanks which is conventional of Chinese seafood restaurants, but the interior decor is much classier and elevated. After you order, they bring the lobsters/crabs that you'll be served to show you its size and tells you any price difference from the quoted price...so no surprises on the bill. You also get to take pictures to show off holding them. We got a mini lobster mountain combo for 2-3 for 4 people and ordered a beef tenderloin cube and noodles on the side. Portions of the lobster (6.5lbs) was well worth 5-6 people as a dish. Taste of everything is not bad, I don't think their flavours stand out compared to other Chinese restaurants. What they win here that makes it worth the money is the service and presentation. The way they plate everything is always picture worthy. The mountains of seafood is a showstopper. I also find the service above par for a Chinese restaurant, servers was more attentive."}
{"text":"It is a two and a half star.  We had the dinner set combo. Of course they can never find the right side crab and lobster, so have you paying more on the final bill.  The soup was ok but I feel like it has a lot of msg.   The clams and fish was very fishy, so I don't think it was fresh.  The Vancouver crab was cooked with salty egg yoke,  it was the best dish and with flavor.  The lobster was deep fried with a lot of flour, it lack seasoning.  They cooked all the vegetables at once so it was not portion correctly.  The shark fin fried rice barely have any shark fins in it.  The dessert taste like corn starch.   The service was below average because they just walk around and ignore you.  We are eating shellfish, they should change our plate or have a dispose bucket for us."}
{"text":"Fishman Wharf Seafood is basically a smaller scale version of the bigger lobster establishment Fishman Lobster Clubhouse standards down the road.  One of several that has appeared along the Steeles Avenue East strip over the last few years.    There is an a-la carte options available but the value for this place is found in their set menus as they do give more variety then the bigger fish down the road.  We took a set lobster menu for 2 for $98 which includes shark fin soup, 2.5 lb lobster cooked 3 ways, fried oysters, vegetables in fish soup, fried sesame rice balls (bonus!) as well as a steamed papaya with milk and bird's nest.  The food was really good, but just below Fishman Lobster Clubhouse... sorry for the constant comparison but you really have to judge the restaurant with them down the road as they are directly competing with them.  The dessert however with the fried sesame rice balls and steamed papaya was outstanding and really stood out for me:)    Service was quick and abrupt like most Chinese restaurants, but the manager was very outgoing and friendly with all the guests.  Restaurant closes late at midnight so good option for a late night meal.  Overall depending on what you order you are looking at anywhere between $50 to $100 per person.  Funny thing is like another Yelper mentioned, the washroom design is pretty brutal as you can get slammed in the face when someone opens the door:)  Being a small restaurant they didn't give much room for the washroom design I guess.  Other then that would definitely come again even though one can risk getting a busted face going to the bathroom:)"}
{"text":"I went here about a year ago.  So this is a late review.  As far as i can remember, the food was very good !!! Seafood lovers will enjoy.  Everything was tasty. Price wise, its up there. See photos.  I think we had the $598 course. The place was busy back then. Only went here once, but it is memorable.. in a good way.  Will go back :)"}
{"text":"Overall, pretty good experience! But I feel like there are other very similar restaurants which have better value, so 3 stars - wouldn't crave for this place but I would return if someone wanted to go.  Dinner for 3 was $345 plus tip.  Ordered a 4lb lobster and 6lb king crab.  King crab was cooked 3 ways,  Steamed with garlic and tofu on the side was the best flavour. Tofu was super yummy compared to other restaurants. Meats was super tasty, juicy, and full of flavour, wanted to get a bowl of plain rice to lick the juices off the plate!! - 4.5 stars for flavour  Stir-fried Hong Kong Style was good.. too much deep fry and not juicy enough.. very crispy though.. would have preferred a little bit less time on the wok. Basically over fried. 3 stars  Crab Tomali Fried Rice didn't look like it was going to impress was it was served onto the table.. but we  were wrong.. probably a level above compared to other restaurants - 4 stars!  4lb lobster was stir-fried Hong Kong style.. same deal with the crab.. over cooked in my opinion. And 4lb is kinda small, would have preferred 5lb or 6lbs, would have made a big difference in taste.. for an extra $40.. (they charge $18/lb). 2.5 stars  Came with garlic stir-fry spinach, not bad. The Chinese style soup lacked ingredients, therefore lacked taste, but it wasn't full of msg, so bonus points. Also came with 2 types of desert..  $115 per person plus tip.. no alcohol.. could have given it 4 stars if it was a tad cheaper.. say $90pp is what other places are charging for the same food.  Same food at Da Fu was $70 including booze, Lobster Fisherman House is about $90 with booze, Yu Seafood is horrible and is about $140pp.."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend, so give it a try. I went on a weekday night, it wasn't that busy, there were three servers throughout the night. Seems they are always busy talking, kinda difficult to draw their attention. Menu are all combo, pretty much they all have the same way to cook the crab n lobster, the price is reflecting the size of the crab n lobster that you are getting. We are party of five and we were planning to order a dinner for four plus an extra dish, when we order, we got notify that they dont have small size of crab anymore and all the crab are 8lbs and up, so either we order a 6-8people combo or we order what we planned to order and pay the size different of the crab which is $40/lb, so kinda disappointed.  Since it wasn't busy so the food came pretty fast, looks good and taste was alright but no wow factor. In a way is kinda disappointed. After tax and tips total $480 for 5 people. With tons of leftover to take out(remember seafood doesn't taste good after reheat). Seems this is how they scam people to over order to push up their sells. The food and service doesn't not deserve at this price range($95/person), Most likely will not return. If you really want to go, maybe you should call in and check if they have small size crab n lobster, or invite more people to go together."}
{"text":"There were 15 of us, including two kids, and each adults paid $70. Yes, that sounds like a lot of money, but consider there were lobster after lobster (total of 6 lobster dishes), and  crab after crab (3 crab dishes and a fried rice),  it was pretty much a bargain. The ONLY disappointment was with the dessert. They ran out of their normal ones, and the one they scrambled together was slightly undercook and gooey. It was disgusting."}
{"text":"We had the steamed fish with black bean, the flavour and the texture are very good, highly recommend We also had the duck& taro noodle soup- the broth is very delish May come back and try their seafood next time"}
{"text":"Food was great. We had a hard time figuring out what to order. We had 10 people and not all the dishes we could figure out. The waitress was having hard time explaining the menu. But, what was great is she got another waiter \"Jay\" to come help us. He was Awesome, we substituted some dishes from the lobster crab combos. And all the food was great. Jay attentive and really gave us a great experience since it was all our first time there."}
{"text":"We come into Toronto to visit my grandma, so we come pretty often. Toronto has a lot of Chinese food that's for sure, but not a lot of places with THIIIS much seafood. I was a little skeptical because of the 3.5 stars, but I came with the whole family and my brother in law's parents really recommended this place, and I know they know their Chinese food!  So it was for a table of 7, for lunch on a Friday afternoon. No wait, and a pretty nice restaurant. There's two giant dried up shark fin on display with various dried up sea food delicacies. The menu has a lot of options of \"prefix sets\" -- 7 dishes for 6 people, 3 dishes for 2 people type of thing, and you just choose that and everything comes out, similar to wedding prefixes. We ordered something for 7 people, cause we had 7, but it seriously could have fed 9 or 10 people. I think the price was about $499?? I could be wrong.   If you've had the Vietnamese 7 course beef, this is VERY SIMILAR, but instead of beef, it is crab and lobster. Be careful if you have high cholesterol, but pescatarians rejoice! I seriously have never had crab and lobster done in soooo many ways -- fried in garlic, stir fried in maggie sauce, steamed and buttered, as sashimi!!, and even boiled in soup form!! That's not even all of them. They were all sooo good too, you really can't stop yourself. Good thing they give you gloves so it protects your hands a little, but I didn't use gloves, I wanted to savor the flavor, ahhahaah!  And even more than that, every dish that comes out looks like a spectacle! You really want to photograph every dish! Of course, we are Asian and want to photograph every dish anyway, but the chef really plate it so it brings out a \"wow\" factor. Pyramid shaped fried rice?? Crab legs spread across a plate like a spider? lobster sashimi over a plate of ice? It's all very beautiful. Every dish that came out, my mom wanted another family photo with the new dish. It became annoying that we had to stop eating to take yet another photo. And we didn't want to keep bothering the waitress. They were bringing out so much food that I had to take a break, a little intermission for my stomach to calm down. MAKE SURE you drink lots of tea/water to help wash it down.   There really wasn't a dish I didn't like, so I recommend pretty much everything -- I think my favorite being the garlicy lobster though. We were licking the shell of the lobster to get more of the garlic flavor. Who doesn't like oil and garlic together?! At the end they give you a small dessert of almond pudding. I think we ate for about a solid hour to hour and a half. There is that much food. My parents were saying how that was a very memorable meal to have had, and yes it was! Just make sure to eat less cholestrol for the rest of the week!"}
{"text":"This place was good but not comparable to Fishermen Clubhouse. For the same amount of money I would rather go up the street and get better food"}
{"text":"Food here was delicioussssss, MY favorite seafood restaurant of all time,We ordered the lobster and crab combo for 10 people I believe and the price was definitely well worth, one of my favortie dishes was the lobster sashimi and the crab legs. Everything was extremely fresh and the service was great as well, they always came in to the room to check in on us and replaced dirty dishes. Food came extremely fast I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"It's a super busy restaurant and the service attitude is really bad. The waitress who helped us is very arrogant. I saw many ppl have the lobster, we have it too. But I don't really like it. Everything is tooooooooo salty. When we talk to the waitress it is too salty, she looks annoyed. Anyway, not a good seafood restaurant for me."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate double birthday; my wife and dad. Booked a room a month ahead of time. Came in and the server took us to our room. Private washroom is a plus and noise level was reduced significantly.   We didn't opt for the prefixed dinner menu, although some of the options have great value. We went a la carte instead. We ordered:  1.  10 lbs Geoduck. All sashimi. When you dip the Geoduck into soy sauce mixed with wasabi, you're in heaven. Ocean fresh!!!  2.  Steam Alaska King Crab Claws with soft tofus. Delicious! Crab meat was tender and juicy.  It was steamed just right so the meat doesn't shrink or get stuck in the shell.   3.  Spicy Fried Alaska King Crab Legs. Very easy to get the meat out of the shell. The spicy coating goes perfectly. Very appetizing!  4.  Steamed Whole Sea Bass. This dish comes in slices. First time eating it this way. Tastes super fresh and goes so well with soy sauce.   5.  Stir Fry U20 Scallop with Snow Peas and Celery in XO Sauce. Vegetables were crunchy, cooked just about right. Scallop was sooooooo gooooooood!!!!  6.  Spare Ribs. Juicy and the meat falls off the bone. Delish!  7.  Sea Cucumber and Goose Feet. Traditional Chinese dish. Good for health and tastes great! Confucius say eating Goose Feet will make your skin more delic  8.  Steamed Bok Choy.  9.  Fried Rice with cooked Alaska King Crab meats. This dish was arranged like a pyramid on a large plate. Truly delicious.   They also brought us in house Herbal Soup. A nice touch! Desert came with Fried Black Sesame balls. Great way to end the night. We left this place very satisfied and stuffed."}
{"text":"Chinese style lobster is honestly my favorite! For those of you who have not tried it is typically lightly battered and fried with ++++ garlic chives and ginger.   I came here with about 8 frds, and this place is great for sharing so the more the merrier! It ended up being around $50/person which was very reasonable for the quality of food we got. My friends made fun of me cuz I actually loved the fried rice more than the seafood =P, but it came with soo much fried garlic which was my favorite"}
{"text":"A group of us came here for new years eve dinner. The service there is great and we got to bring our own alcohol.  Like Jennifer K already said in a previous review, the set dinner meals are only for even number of people, and they don't provide an extra dish if you have one extra person. So for example, we had 7 people and we ordered a 6 people set meal, and they only gave us 6 sharks fin soup, and 6 oysters. Fortunately, not all the dishes are divvied out that way, so we only had to make do with 2-3 courses that had to be shared.  Most of their dishes were really fishy, even though the flavour is good. Our last course, which was the clam, however, was almost inedible cuz it tasted so unfresh.   The mountainous lobster, however, was really really good. It was made stir-fried with fried breaded onions and garlic and it was DELICIOUS. I must say that although the rest of the seafood is not very worth it, I did LOVE the lobster and sharksfin soup, which say a lot for me, since I don't generally like lobsters.  Pictures to come!  Oh, and I should mention that it's not cheap. You are looking at spending approximately $50-$75/person."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun if you're in the mood for a change!   We had a party of 7 and ordered one of the set meals that came with some soup, crab, a big crunchy garlickly tower of lobster, fish, rice, and some other small dishes.  Food was not amazing tbh but experience was fun and the lobster tower is a cool novelty dish. I don't think the lobster was amazing, nor was there really that much meat, but still fun nonetheless!   Kinda on the pricey end at about $70pp for the set meal and two bottles of wine for the table but we were definitely stuffed after.   Though I had fun, I likely won't go back. Once was enough and there are way too many other places to try in the city."}
{"text":"You will come eye to eye with  Lobsters and King Crabs the moment you entered into Fishmen Wharf Seafood Restaurant.  Specialized in seafood and that's what you should be here for!   The dinner menu is all set meals for 2/4/6/8/10 people which a combination of lobster, king crabs, fish, oyster and shark fin. Starting from $68 for a set dinner for 2. There are also some set combos that comes with a bottle of wine.  Sadly, I was here alone.....during lunch. There's no lobster for me but though there is a lunch menu which have some snacks, congee or noodles one can choose from.  Fish Noodle and Fish Fillet in a Fish Broth ($7.50) though has good flavour but the portion is really small.   I want more... seafood.  I guess I would have to come back for dinner with at least 1 more person in order to try out their set meals...  Lobster........."}
{"text":"Is everyone crazy, or did I just get a bad chef that night? I really wanted to like this place because so many reviews said it was better than Fisherman Lobster Clubhouse (either in terms of price or quality of food), and since I really enjoyed my meal at FLC, I had very high expectations which just were not met. In terms of the prices, I thought they were actually about the same as FLC. There, my family ordered a 3-person set meal for $138 - here I think a comparable set was about $128 so really the difference was minimal. My family actually ended up ordering a 4-person set which I believe was about $148.  The main issue I took with this place was the quality of the lobster. Our lobster was cooked Hong Kong style, and honestly the flavours were quite good... it was a little bit spicy, but bursting with flavour which I really enjoyed. I felt like I was just eating really delicious (but expensive) fried dough though. There was just so much batter on each piece of lobster - to be quite honest I didn't even feel like I was eating lobster and couldn't taste any natural lobster flavour at all what with all the heavy seasoning. What I was even more disgruntled about, however, was the fact that the lobster was extremely overcooked. In general, each piece of lobster was just too tough and too dry, and was difficult to remove from the shell to eat.  This restaurant is probably a third of the size of Fisherman Lobster Clubhouse and isn't as aesthetically pleasing - it doesn't have the huge tanks or bright lights and other things which make FLC look impressive.   In summary, I was really disappointed with the lobster and wouldn't come back again. I think my past experiences have taught me that fried lobster is just not really my thing (I prefer it steamed), but even if I was craving fried lobster, this place would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now.  The quality or taste of the food has deteriorated a bit over the years but it's still a much better deal for what you get than at Fisherman's Clubhouse which is just down the street.  This time we went for an early mother's day celebration.  We got the set 4A which feeds 4 but it was more than enough for 5 people.  We even had some leftovers to take home.  We got an appetizer plate (complimentary), soup, 5lb lobster, honey oysters, veggies, rice, sea cucumber with goose feet, steamed fish and finished off with sweet pumpkin soup.  The place gets pretty packed on weekends.  I overheard them on the phone turning down people so make sure to make a reservation during regular weekend dinner times.  The place is a bit squishy and it can get pretty stuffy inside.  Would come back if I get a craving for seafood again."}
{"text":"Holy seafood. We have arrived. At the holy grail of Crab: king crab, crab 5 ways, crab gut party with all his friends from down under. Mind-blowing courses in sheer size, flavor and innovation. From wall to wall of this large banquet styled restaurant, fish tanks were showcased with large fish and shell fish. You basically say I want him and his friends in tank number five and they bring it to u for... inspection? Sorta like tasting the wine after uncorking. Course we said a resounding Yes Please to everything, even the unnecessary, but so necessary 10 courses of feasting. It was a meal that necessitated drawstring pants.   Notable were the snow crab legs arranged like a Jenga pile stir fried and buried with fried garlic chips as were the giant lobster. So dam good with rice, but who has room for rice?! And the fried oyster patties- holy... delish. I don't even know how to describe them but they were gutty, creamy, fried, oyster. And we had so much more...   If someone can fund a SF Wharf in the states, granted appropriate location and target patronage, it would kill. It would literally kill our pockets and then kill our bodies because we wouldn't be able to control the gluttony that would ensue."}
{"text":"We visited Fishman Wharf Seafood for a lunch-time birthday celebration for my mom. There is only two options when we celebrate in my family (1) buffet with seafood, and (2) seafood.   Ultimately, we only celebrate with seafood. My parents yield joy from ingesting crustaceans. We have ordered both a la carte and set menus in the past. Set menus are definitely more cost effective. However, if you want to indulge in a lobster feast, I would recommend a la carte.   Set menu for $128 includes, lobster with noodles, lobster and sea cucumber congee, vegetable with goji, Bonito Flakes in fish broth, HK Style (tsunami village) crab, soy sauce crab, deep fried meat floss garlic lobster and deep dried donut! It is definitely a real steal! Lobster in the combo is 5 lb. There is always leftovers to take home. At odd times, the lobster may be very cook by a few seconds.   Overall, I would recommend Fishman Wharf if you are a seafood lover! I love the variety and range of options!"}
{"text":"Tell it like it is, its the cheaper version of Fishman Lobster Clubhouse without the up sell on the lobster. Extremely reasonably priced set meals with a wide range of variety and selection not chinsey at all on the good stuff. Where it falls one star short is the level of service. Not to say its got bad service just not up to the standard the Fishman Wharf is portraying to customers.   The food is grade A and they cook it any way you want it, although they are famous for their set menu styled items. The portion sizes are generous and their set menus have serving indications for ease of selection. I have eaten the 4 course meal with 4 people and I would have to say it was just the right amount if not a little more. For what you are paying sub $200 for sharks fin, crab, geoduck, and lobster options available the Fishman Wharf has a set meal that will satisfy your taste buds and your wallet. The geoduck and sharkfin is very premium with thick strands of sharks fin in the sharks fin soup not the tiny bowl you are expecting at regular places spending the same price tag. The thing with Fishman Lobster Clubhouse as Im sure alot have heard of is the up sell; the we are out of 3LB lobster and only have 5LB available, you will have to pay $$ extra line. Its a big turn off/cash grab feel especially when the meal easily increases by 30-50.  Where the place falls short is the overall lack of excellent customer service. Not to say it is non-existent but the whole luxury feeling and setting just makes it a little out of place. Simple things like changing your plate when its full of shells/bones are not done until requested. Other than the little quirks this place definitely has FRESH seafood at reasonable prices."}
