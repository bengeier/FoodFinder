{"text":"Pretty decent pho and reasonable servings. Meat is never hard to chew but then again, I only eat #101 every time when I go there so I don't know about the rest."}
{"text":"Food is great... from the pho to their spring rolls. I'm not big fan of the rice there...  they use regular rice and not the real \"com\" for the rice dishes.    Ice coffee is great too Have been going here for the last 4+years.... and will continue to support and recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ordered pork with my Pho.  I couldn't figure out what the meat was.  I then realized it was bacon! which is pork, I guess.  The soup wasn't very flavourful.  My son loves Pho but will only eat here if some of the other food court restaurants are closed that day."}
{"text":"My favourite place in the FMP food court. I'm always here for lunch.  And my all-time favourite dish is Spring Roll on Dry Vermicelli. Good portion, good price. It even tastes better than many Vietnamese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Pho Ling's in First Markham Place is located near the stage when you enter First Markham Place (FMP), on the left side. It's a cute little store that specializes in Vietnamese food. I think they're like the only store in FMP that specializes in Vietnamese food.  I've came here a few times and it's a family owned restaurant. The owners are both really nice and sweet! They can speak both Cantonese and Vietnamese besides English, so it's good to be able to communicate with them in Cantonese and get to know them a bit better (since I don't know Vietnamese at all). & I believe they're open half day on Wednesdays.  The taste of authentic Vietnamese food can be noted compared to some of the other places that I've been to. Plus the price range is pretty cheap too, because it's from a food court instead of a restaurant. With your food combos, with a choice of a bottle of water, pop, or soy milk... I always get full from eating here, totally worth it!   We got bun cha gio which is #32 (I believe), it's the grilled pork chop and spring roll vermicelli dish.  Pho Ling's has the best spring roll I've ever tried among all the other Vietnamese restaurants!! It's big, crispy and crunchy. Also, it's not stuffed with vegetables like some restaurants.. some restaurants stuff their spring roll with radish and carrots.. just not my style y'know. Their spring rolls is chewy and full of meat, heehee.  Pho Ling's also serves Pho, Bun bo hue, several other noodles and other rice dishes. You have to try the spring rolls if you come to Pho Ling's - a must get! / super duper highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I go to First Markham regularly for lunch and Pho Ling's is a go to place for something delish and cheap.    I usually get the Pork Chop on rice with a fried egg on top.  it's something like $6 and includes a bottle of water....cheap cheap cheap."}
{"text":"If you're like me, then you may have never tried food court pho because you're skeptical that it could be any good. Well, I finally tried it and I loved Pho Ling's!  For just $7 and change, you get a nice size bowl of beef pho and it comes with a canned drink!    The noodles were perfectly cooked, the broth was tasty and not too herby and no cilantro, and the portion left me feeling full and satisfied. Overall, excellent value and I love to recommend this place for pho to anyone.  They're located in the food court of First Markham Place, so good luck finding parking during peak lunch or dinner times."}
{"text":"Pho Ling's has been at First Markham Place for many years now. Not much has changed, still the same friendly and always smiling group that work there.   I usually order the House Special Pho, which is loaded with Beef Tendon, cooked and rare beef, tripe and beef balls on top of a decent portion of noodles. They use dry noodles, which I'm not really a fan of, but the broth is what makes it so good. It doesn't have a overwhelming amount of MSG, and it's the right level of sweet/savoury flavour. A good bowl of pho, for a decent price.   I tried the Spring Roll and Lemongrass Chicken Vermicelli my most recent visit, and it was definitely disappointing. The accompanying sauce tasted like a mix of Salt and Vinegar, lacking that tangy and sweet flavour. The Spring Rolls looked delicious, but were loaded with pork that had a funky taste and huge chunks of taro. The grilled chicken was okay, but was lacking flavour. It was just lacking flavour all over, and didn't have veggies like basil or enough crushed peanuts and fried onions to give it some crunch. Maybe I'm just expecting too much from a food court place, but this was just disappointing because other items are great."}
{"text":"Good pork chop on rice meal, for $5.75 it comes with a pop or water or tea.  This is the best vietnamese pork chop dinner you'll find in asian malls.  I personally prefer it over any other Vietnamese restaurant.  I usually get 27, I think that's what it's called.  Grilled Lemon grass pork chop with a spring roll, and some veggies (lettuce, tomato, cucumber)."}
{"text":"Big portion and inexpensive, but there is where the pluses end.  I ordered dry pho with grilled chicken and spring rolls.  The chicken tasted dated and on the brink of going bad.  The spring rolls were very crunchy (good) but the meat inside tasted dated, too.  The noodle was okay though."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in the First Markham Place food court.  I usually over #37, Spicy Beef Vermicelli. Not too spicy, but spicy enough for me, and the beef slices are usually very tender and chewy. Green onions, white onions, vietnamese sausage are also included in the bowl. I usually special request some beef tripe, as I love it...for some reason. Broth isn't full of MSG unlike some other fast food places.  All comes to an inexpensive $6 or so along with a bottle of water, pop, or soy milk (or iced coffee for extra charge - HIGHLY RECOMMEND), and it will fill you right up!"}
{"text":"Good place for a cheap pho, I find their soup base better than most Vietnamese restaurants. Spring rolls are superb, nice and crispy with a lot of filling!"}
{"text":"I'm usually hesitant on getting pho at a food court as I tend to think that because it's just a store within a mall, they lack customers and so stock less compared to a pho restaurant which leads to a compromise in the freshness and quality of their ingredients. Pho Ling's has changed my perception of food court pho stores. Located in the corner of the food court, this place is barely noticeable, but let me assure you that you'll never forget this place once you've tried their house special pho and spring rolls.   The broth in the house special was very flavoursome, and their spring rolls were crisp. CRISP. I never use fish sauce, but let me tell you that I tried it with the spring rolls from this place, and HOLY TASTEBUDS... I tasted just about every flavour known to man that so beautifully fused together in just the perfect blend. Basically, try their spring rolls is what I'm saying.  By the way, drinks are complimentary with meals. Came to about $7.90 tax in for the Pho, and $4.50 tax in for the spring rolls (2 pieces).   Note: cash only"}
{"text":"Pho Ling's is the Vietnamese kiosk in the First Markham Place food court and has been run by the same family as far as I remember.  The owners are really friendly and speak Vietnamese, Cantonese and English fluently so no problems ordering here:).  I've only gotten pho here over the years as its very good especially for a food court.  The broth is flavourful and the noodles cooked perfectly.  The protein portion is a little on a small side but seriously hard to complain when you get pho for $7.50 (tax included) and it comes with a drink!  Overall very good value for pho and +1 for a really nice family!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5 This place is located on Rodick Rd. and Hwy 7 inside the food court at First Markham Place. Parking spots near the entrance are limited during peak hours   [SERVICE] - 4/5 Staff were friendly and efficient.   [DÃ‰COR] - 4/5  Seating in food court was limited during lunch rush, but sufficient for a quick meal.   [QUALITY] - 3/5 Average-quality ingredients for pho from a food court. Nothing too fancy, and hits the spot if I crave cheap pho.   [ORDER] - 3/5 - House Special Pho (comes with with pop/water bottle) - $7.00: beef balls and beef slices were not incredibly tender, but satisfactory. Noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. Definitely worth the price because the pho comes with a drink.   [OVERALL] - 3/5 Definitely worth the value because the portion was quite large. Overall, I would recommend Pho Ling's for their decent and cheap pho."}
{"text":"Maybe I should had order a pho with no toppings?!  Pho with Raw Beef ($5.99) with choice of pop/water is a good value. I like how the noodle is served in a plastic bowl instead of one of those take out containers... Have you ever see those styrofoam containers melt because of how hot the broth is?!  Portion is good and broth is decent.  But sadly though, the raw beef was hard and chewy and tasted freezer burnt.  Too many of those beef in my noodle really making my bowl of pho MEH.  But for that price, maybe I am expecting too much?! Life is too short for cheap medocre food.  I will pass...i"}
