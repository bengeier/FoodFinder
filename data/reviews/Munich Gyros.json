{"text":"I've eaten gyros pretty much everywhere in AZ and this place is up there for one of the best!"}
{"text":"A wonderful new place to eat in Fountain Hills. Wonderful gyros with a very friendly owner and staff. I've eaten here 20 times and it is always delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my first time in with the new owners.  And I'm happy to say it won't be my last.  Service with a smile and the best gyro I've had...probably ever.  The tzatziki sauce is amazing!  They serve steak fries which in my opinion are the hardest to properly prepare.  BEST EVER!  Super creamy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. I took a friend with me and he felt the same way.  He even bought one to take home to his wife.  Great job you guys... Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Simply put, we happened upon this place by accident on the way back from Fountain Hills.  I have eaten at several Gyro joints in the past and have grown to expect modest portions.  The portions were filling even for a large guy like me and the meat was tender, fresh and flavored well.  Make sure you get the fries too.  I just wanted to hop the counter and give the the cook a high five.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Third time back and this place is better than ever! I travel from out of state and stay at the hotel across from this wonderful eatery. This is the best part of my trip! I'm always ready to chow down on the gyro plate with fries."}
{"text":"Always good food, with excellent and friendly service. I love the Greek chicken salad and love the hummus."}
{"text":"Delicious. Priced correctly. Good portions (Get the Fries). Convenient location. Note: While this is located in the same building as the Circle K, it is not \"inside\" the Circle K. It has its own storefront and parking. In other words, you do not go into Circle K to access it :-). Yum Yum - GYROS!!!"}
{"text":"I love Munich Gyros!  I live in Fountain Hills and the owners of this restaurant are top notch!  They truly care about their customers and want to provide the best, most authentic food possible.  They are friendly and fast, and the food is cooked fresh to order!  Good to go, and they have a small recently remodeled dining room.  Highly recommend!  Pita and hummus great!"}
{"text":"Great place for Greek food. Gyro are the very best.. Service is excellent.. Do not miss this restaurant.."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Hard to see because it's in a gas station, but the employees are super friendly and it's authentic Greek people at the grill. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Fresh, authentic and delicious food! Super nice and friendly employees, clean place.. I had such a great experience at this place.. Definitely will go back again! Philly gyro pita is my favorite and of course steak fries are soo yummy !"}
{"text":"Best hummus I've ever eaten. Wonderfully authentic middle eastern food. The best ME food I've eaten in Phoenix and was mesmerized with each bite. Owner was very nice and seating was simple and clean."}
{"text":"Awesome gyro...all you need to know! And if you need to know more then come and meet the nicest owners and eat some of the best gyro in the Valley!"}
{"text":"This place gets it!!  High quality food and great service!  Had the Grape Leaves and a Greek Salad with Gyro meat! Fantastic!  Highly recommend!!  All made fresh to order!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was very glad we did! Oftentimes when you see a Greek/Mediterranean restaurant that is smaller you run the risk of the average fast food genre gyro stand. I was really pleased to find that the food was very fresh and obviously made from scratch. The portions were very generous and it made it very easy to share sides as we chose different ones. My husband had the regular gyro and the side of rice. He said the meat was very tender and juicy and in a gyro that is really the key. I had the veggie platter which included the falafel, dolma, hummus, pita and tzatziki. My side was the salad and it was super fresh and tasty. Perfectly dressed and crisp, with the right amount of peppers, onions, olives, feta, and tomatoes. The price was what you would expect based on location but the quality and service was top notch. I would definitely recommend this as a must stop."}
{"text":"My husband and I were leaving town after a weekend away and stumbled upon this place. I'm so happy we did. The gyros are delicious with incredible homemade pitas!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in just before closing and asked if they were still serving, literally 5 minutes to closing. They welcomed us warmly and said we could stay and eat without having to take our food out. They were very friendly and even gave us a free sample of one of their sweet pastries for desert. The gyro sandwiches were very good and my son had a chicken sandwich that was also very good. I've rarely felt so welcome at a fast food place. Next time I'm in Fountain Hills I'm going to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Tasty gyros and excellent customer service. The owner was so nice and gave chocolate cookies and honey cookies to my boys. Keep it up with the delicious food and outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Dropped our car off at Discount Tire. Opened up Yelp for a lunch spot and found this little gem!!!! Fabulous service fabulous food and an extremely friendly environment . Thanks Yelp   Ali and his staff were wonderful. We will be back again and again"}
{"text":"Food is always great  and very friendly staff. .The gyros are my favorite, nice size portions and always freshly made.  I also think their french fries are the best around.  Give it a shot and see for yourself"}
{"text":"Had a Gyros Combo Good price Very well cooked and fresh Fresh and well seasoned fries This is a great local place with really good food.   I would return for more"}
{"text":"Very good .... Nice little place. The salad hit the spot and the Gyro Meat was mild and delicious. We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for the great find. Gyros were delicious. Thinly sliced just right. Hubby had an Angus burger that was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and fantastic service. Been there prior and this time i was unable to get away from work so I called to see if they delivered. Gentleman said not yet but after asking me where i was located, literally across the street, he went ahead and took my order and sent someone to deliver the food. Fantastic service!!!!"}
{"text":"Really good! Came here about a week ago as I'm exploring local places; definitely will come back here. Seems to be family owned which is always nice to see. Ordered in (a gyro plate) and tzatziki sauce appetizer. The gyro was huge and fresh with lamb/beef combo with the classics: tomato, lettuce, tzatziki and the warm pita bread. Came with seasoned French fries. There was a steady stream of business, both people coming to eat in or to go orders, and I hope this continues. The owners were friendly and the location clean. Will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken kabobs--incredibly tender and tasty. This is clearly a shop that takes pride in great food."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great gyro and falafel. Plus, I showed up once right when they were closing and they rang me up without hesitation. Their delicious food and the great service brought a smile to my face."}
{"text":"I've had gyros on the east coast in North Carolina and when I saw this place I hoped it would serve good food.  This is a mom and pop shop serving fresh gyros I've ordered the lamb one twice.  They are very friendly.  The food is fresh all the time the fries with the gyro were mouth scolding hot!  A great place a gyro and fries for around $7.00 delicious too!  A nice little place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered the traditional gyro and a Greek salad. I ate the gyro and it tasted good. It's not the best I've had, but it wasn't bad. It's a tiny place and I walked in on an argument between the chef and lady taking orders... it was awkward... but everyone has bad days..."}
{"text":"Chicken is very well seasoned!  Generous with the tzazaki sauce and meat portions.  Good service.  Wish there was a bit more veggies."}
{"text":"We are always looking for a good place near the house to carry out from.  Munich meets all the criteria.  Good food, quick and reasonably priced.  We had the combo of chicken and gyro meat. It came with a Greek salad, Humus and pita.  We phoned our order in, and Morgan was great on the phone and said our order would be ready in 10 minutes.  She was true to her word.  When we got home everything tasted great.  The portions were so big, I will be having it for lunch again tomorrow!  I have a feeling we will be regulars at Munich!"}
{"text":"I would give it 3.5 if I could. Above average to good Greek food. We usually get chicken Kabab platter. Gyros are good too. Nice family that runs it."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and inexpensive, the employees were friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was great! If we ever end up in Fountain Hills again, I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"What a great place!!! We have lived in Fountain Hills for four years and just by chance found this  hidden treasure purely by accident. The food was delicious. Friendly staff. We had the homemade lemon chicken soup and regular gyros and chicken gyros. The meat was spiced superbly and the pitas were overflowing with meat, The tomatoes, onions and tzatziki sauce were layered first and then the meat. A perfect way to serve a gyro so all the fixings stay in place and you taste everything every time you take a bite. This is now our place to go for Greek food."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food.  Loved my gyro!  The place doesn't look cute from the outside, but it is nice inside and the people are very friendly.  We liked the fries too.  Next time I want to get the hummus.  We will be back often.  It is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The best French fries anywhere. Order a gyro platter and dip your fries in tzatziki sauce! The owners are charming!"}
{"text":"Arrived here 15 minutes before closing but the owners welcomed us wholeheartedly. The food was fresh and delicious. They checked on us throughout our meal to make sure we were enjoying it then brought us each baklava on the house.  Wish I weren't passing through because I would definitely be a regular. Great service! Great hospitality! Great food!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fabulous. Best tzaitzki sauce I have ever had. Been here maybe 6-7 times now. The service is always great. I'm not sure why they have burgers on the menu but I tried it, it was also awesome. Little pricey but quality is obvious  I got the chicken plate this time. Good stuff. Like the gyro better but all good"}
{"text":"Delicious. Freshly prepared every day. Owner is generous and friendly, dedicated to customer happiness. Most restaurants in Fountain Hills use substandard ingredients, but Munich is good and honest food. (And you don't have to add 20% to your bill for wait staff who interrupt throughout your meal!) We love Munich so much we serve their delicious food to guests visiting our home and everyone compliments my cooking. (Yes, I tell them it's Munich!)"}
{"text":"Change of ownership.... Again. This is the 4th set of owners since we started to come here, and I'm not impressed. It just isn't the same great food  sad, but the Greek dressing is Italian dressing, the gyro meat is dry and not as tasty, the tsatsiki is missing garlic. Gonna find me a new gave Greek place."}
{"text":"Stoped in here on a tip from a friend. This place rocks. The owner is very nice  goes out of his way to make you happy. Brought me more sauce for my gyros. I will be coming here as often as possible. It is very clean and well kept up."}
{"text":"First timer and I was indeed impressed.  Located on Shea way up near the crossing of highway 87, I couldn't believe that there were so many people coming to this place and now I know why.  The food is mediterranean/Greek and it is fresh and plentiful.  Everything is made to order--there is nothing hanging around to be served which is a good thing.  So although you have to wait for your food, it is worth the wait.   I had the greek salad with chicken schwarma which had a wonderful dressing, feta cheese, kalamata olives, tomatoes and wonderful crunchy greens.  I am not a fan of cinnamon on meat but this is a greek inspired restaurant.  They use cinnamon and there was definitely a hint of cinnamon on the chicken. I ate some but didn't finish it.   Hubby had the gyro platter which came with an amazing side salad, hummus, pita, and grape leaves instead of the Tszazeki(?) that usually comes with this platter.   It was nice of him to switch it up.  Hubby enjoyed the platter which was plentiful and delicious. The owner was friendly and accommodating and it is clear to me that people in the neighborhood know that this is a good place to eat because they kept pouring in for take out and dine-in.   We will be back."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place.  I have been coming here every week since it opened and it's simply the best Gyro I have EVER had and every time it's the same.  Every time I try a Guro at a different restaurant I compare it and it's not even close.  Everyone there is also so friendly."}
{"text":"The places that slice off the spit already have a leg up. Meat was tender and juicy and had good spices. Pita was soft and vegetables were good. I would have liked more taziki sauce on it.   Not a lot of options in fountain hills so it's nice to have a good gyro spot in the area."}
{"text":"The  greek salad was the best very fresh i love it  then i order chicken pita is phenomenal  fantastic i love all their foods and the fries was so crispy come and try their foods  you will love it im sure!!!"}
{"text":"Hungry and didn't know what to eat. Found this place on yelp, location is near the mc donalds. Very good gyro and steak frys. You can watch TV while waiting. Overall excellent 5*s."}
{"text":"Great food love there gryo meal they have for 9.98. Will be coming back when in town busting family."}
{"text":"Delicious was looking for something to eat saw the ratings checked it out, I was not disappointed. I had the Gyro plate, my wife had the gyro combo"}
{"text":"Holy yummy. Their hummus is sooooo good. Unexpectedly good since it's in a Circle K parking lot! But delicious. Genuine Mediterranean food. Everyone was very friendly. Only downside is cook was outside smoking before we walked in. Kind of off-putting."}
{"text":"Great Gyros. Food prepared fast and good service. Also like the grape leaves. Price is a bit higher then some other places but close to home so evens out."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Stopped in on road trip, not expecting much, but discovered delicious food and great service. Yummy"}
{"text":"I have been craving gyros and stumbled upon this place and it was awesome. Satisfied my craving and I'll be there again sometime very very soon. Great gyros with great flavors. The gyro combo with drink and fries is an awesome deal as well, only 8.98!! Great portions for such a great price. I will for sure recommend this place to anyone in town and will return again! On top of the food being great the service was very friendly!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant is top notch. The food is always perfect and the taste fantastic. The hummus..... my mouth is watering right now.  My fav is the mixed plate. You have to stop in and get some of this grub! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"A very authentic Greek/Mediterranean restaurant - great fast food! I had the chicken gyro, mounds of moist seasoned chicken, garlic/lemon/oregano, in a warm toasty fluffy pita, taziki, lettuce and red onions, was very delicious.  Greek salad of cucumbers, feta, olives and citrus vinaigrette, was very fresh.  Sister had the falafel pita, hot crispy, homemade falafels, spiced so well, in the warm pita and taziki sauce.  We also had the hummus, again home made and delicious, creamy, hint of garlic and a splash of olive oil.  Portions are huge and the sandwiches come with a combo deal with a soda and fries or Greek salad for a very reasonable price.  Workers/owners are very friendly, we had no room for dessert/baklava, which looked delicious as well.  Located in the back of a gas station, so don't miss this restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped by this evening on my way home from work. I was impressed by the simple but clean interior. I was greeted by Ali who was friendly and polite. Ordered the Gyro combo. Ali made sure it was hot and fresh. The meat was tasty and the fries crisp and well-seasoned. Ali was hospitable and made sure I had all the condiments to give it that extra kick. The portions were large and the price, reasonable. I am glad I found this little slice of heaven in Fountain Hills. I'll be back! Soon!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to stop in for a gyro. I'd heard good things about this place and am happy to report, what I'd heard were accurate!  Typical gyros place with Kronos meat. Perfectly traditional gyro. The right size and the right price. My only minor note is the tzatziki had a strong almost overpowering pickle flavor."}
{"text":"I am a long-time fan of Greek food, so of course I had to stop at Munich Gyros. It is such a nice, friendly, very clean restaurant! The food is so absolutely fresh & good! I have tried gyros all over the USA, but none as good as Munich Gyros. Their prices are reasonable & you won't leave hungry for sure!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, great service. We come here often and it is always a good choice. Had the beef kabab this evening, we now have a new favorite..."}
{"text":"I was in Fountain Hills doing a project for work and stopped here for lunch. The dining area is small, but well laid out.  Everything was nice and clean, including the restroom. The employee who took my order was friendly and helpful. Last but not least, the food was delicious. I had the Chicken Pita Gyros, which was very flavorful. I will definitely stop by again the next time I'm out this way."}
{"text":"What a welcome surprise in Fountain Hills!   Fresh, homemade hummus, excellent Greek salad and the best Gyros in the Valley.  Add the seasoned steak fries and its a home run.  Service is outstanding and the family atmosphere makes me want to return as often as possible."}
{"text":"Great food.  I especially like the  chicken Greek salad.   Small but clean and modern.   Excellent service."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! I love the place. I carry our but it has a neat and very clean dining area. Ingredients are quality and presentation is impressive."}
{"text":"Very good gyro meat. Everyone really enjoyed the food. Cute little place on the inside, don't skip it based on how it looked outside.highly recommend the Greek said..authentic and delicious!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner tonight and had the gyro pita with rice. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It was quick and hot and very fresh!  It seems to be family owned and ran and that is a huge plus for me. The only thing ... And it's not that big a deal but I asked for no lettuce and it had lettuce on it. It wasn't shredded so it was super easy to pull off. I really wanted to try their hummus but I will save that for next time.  Hmm...maybe I'll go back tonight for the pita and hummus!  Lol"}
{"text":"At the far east end of Fountain Hills, almost to the Beeline Highway, next to Circle K on Shea and Saguaro is a great little eatery that is easy to pass-up because is not very big.  The sign out front is not very eye-catching; the name is a bit dichotomous.  There are a lot of cars coming and going on this busy corner, the driveway is short and narrow and parking is insufficient.  However, it is worth seeking out Munich Gyros for a tasty bite to eat.  Inside there are only nine tables; some are hi tops and some are regular tabletops with chairs and sit-down tables.  The kitchen area is open, within view of the public, and clean.  Everything on the menu is made to order and the sauces, dressings, dips and falafel are made on premises.  The dining area is clean, tidy and although small, it is arranged in a way that you do not feel uncomfortable eating so close to others.  Music is always playing inside, which is nice.  Some days you will hear Greek music, other days it will be Country music.     The menu is typical Mediterranean; Gyros, Pita Sandwiches, Salads, Grilled Meat and Vegetable Plates served with Rice, Soup and/or Salad.  Also offered are Burgers and Baklava for Dessert.  Fountain drinks are Coke products along with freshly brewed iced tea and also Monster drinks in a can.  If you don't like the drink offerings, Circle K is right next door.    Munich Gyros is considered a quick service restaurant, however, fast it is not - the food here is made to order.  A good portion of their business is call in orders for take out.  Call in orders can be a bit difficult sometimes as dine in orders will sometimes be put into the queue first and take precedence, leaving you to wait for your call ahead order.  When it is busy, typically during lunchtime, things can get a bit chaotic at the register with communication breaking down in the kitchen area and meals prepared out-of-order.  Although I did experience this on more than one occasion, it was remedied and compensated by giving extra portions or additional food.  The staff is friendly and passionate about their food and really wants you to have a good experience and return again.    In less busy times, the employees are often prepping and making food.  The restaurant tables and kitchen area are impeccably clean and kept that way.  However, there are some quirks too.  It took my third or fourth visit to finally realize that the trash bin is tucked away, hidden in the corner, by the front door.  Depending on who is at the counter you can either feel welcomed, where your food is brought to your table and you are given a friendly goodbye, or you can be rushed to order your food, be called back up to the counter to get your food and not acknowledged again.  It all depends on how busy they are and who is at the register; either way, the food is consistently fresh and tasty.  The Falafel is among the best I have tasted.  The Marinated Chicken Kebabs are moist, tender and flavorful.  The hummus is satisfying, grape leaves are fresh and the Tzatziki sauce has a balance of zing, seasoning and bite that lends well to whatever it is put on.  The salad is standard romaine with a few veggies, but is fresh and crunchy, feta cheese not withstanding.  The Gyro meat is the same Beef & Lamb Kronos brand found at other establishments, which is to say it is a familiar flavor.  The burger is average in taste and quality but it is cooked to order and with fries is a filling meal.  The fries are thick cut and meaty, a.k.a. steak fries and are properly salted.  The pita is soft and lightly toasted and the menu portions are ample.  All in all, the food is tasty, fresh and a decent value.    Overall, the staff are friendly, caring and keep a clean restaurant.  While service is a bit inconsistent, the food and well-intentioned employees more than make up for these few shortcomings.  Munich Gyros is a solid choice for Greek Mediterranean food in Fountain Hills, especially if you are in this end of town; this is perhaps one of your better choices.    Overall:  3.8 Stars Quality:  4 Stars Service:  4 Stars Cleanliness:  4.5 Stars Value:  3.5 Stars Atmosphere:  3 Stars"}
{"text":"Super sweet people work here!!! :) The food is amazing and quick, yet authentic and not exactly \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday. Visiting from Massachusetts. WOW!! Excellent food, excellent service, clean and the owner was so personable. Had to search a bit for the store front. Was on the back side from where we entered the parking lot. Glad we didn't give up!"}
{"text":"This place was unexpectedly good. We are vegetarians, but both of our meals were delish. I had a veggy pita, loaded with veggies, hummus and tzaziki. The pita itself is fluffy and tasty. My husband had a falafel pita and it was exceptional. He had a side of rice and it was seasoned perfectly. I had a Greek salad and it was tangy and fresh. Doesn't look like much from the outside but it's clean and nice inside. The owner was there and he's friendly too. Try it!"}
{"text":"Good food value the gyro with cheese fries and a drink for $9 was very good and the women that works there is cute."}
{"text":"Meat, side salad, hummus, fries and tzakziti sauce were all flavorful.  Portions were generous."}
{"text":"Great small neighborhood place with delicious gyros and Mediterranean specialties. The gyro plate included a good portion of meat along with a side salad, humus and sauce. Very tasty. Restaurant is very clean and the staff very attentive"}
{"text":"The best Gyros I have ever tasted!  The meat is fresh and so are the veggies, pita everything.  The owners are sweet and willing to please to your palette.  Also have a great tasting fries and sodas too!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years now. Food is always freshly prepared and tastes amazing!!  Service is great and the prices ain't too bad either!!  WINNER WINNER GYRO DINNER!!"}
{"text":"We love Munich Gyro and even though they have changed ownership a few times since we first moved to town, their food is more delicious than ever. I usually order the Veggie Plate which includes Hummus, Tzatziki, Falafel and Dolmades and is fabulous. The Greek salad is also delicious and I hear that the Gyros are great as well from my dining partners. We have never dined inside as there is not much ambiance, however the new owners are very nice and the addition of a piece of baklava with our take out orders is much appreciated!"}
{"text":"The best in Scottsdale / Fountain Hills Area ! Their hummus is incredible, staff is super friendly and fast. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area, don't look any further this place will satisfy your cravings for good food. This place makes me never want to go eat at Pita Jungle again. They have awesome combo specials for under 10$ that includes a huge tasty pita, fries and a drink ! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN BEST GYRO I'VE EVER HAD! We go here every time we head out of town and I could not ask for a better gyro or customer service! Every time I have been there the staff have been so accommodating and friendly. Let me just say this...THEY CUT THE GYRO MEAT FRESH TO ORDER FROM A ROTISSERIE!!! It is absolutely amazing! What else are you looking for in authentic Greek cuisine? Absolutely love this place and can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"This place is local and amazing. The gyro sandwich is overloaded with tasty meat, tomatoes, lettuce and sauce that is made fresh daily. great food at a really affordable price. If you're not up for greek food (really?) the hamburger looked very tasty also :-)"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! I ordered just the gyro and it was big enough for me to get full and didn't need any sides. The meat was tender, juicy and the tzatziki sauce was creamy. I did come by when it was just one person doing the cooking and ordering so it was a small wait but the food was worth it. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and super nice husband and wife owners. I had the meat combo plate and my brother had the gyro salad.  Nice big servings and I had to take half my meal home."}
{"text":"I am new to Fountain Hills and was pleasantly surprised to find this place. The food is delicious and adds a lot to the local food scene. Burgers are good but for something a little different, the gyros are excellent and made fresh."}
{"text":"Too far to go again, but I would if I had a reason for heading back to Fountain Hills. Best Chicken Grilled Gyro I've had in a while!!!"}
{"text":"Falafel, hummous and the pita is so good. Traditional and authentic. The owner is so kind and gracious!"}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best Greek food.  Too bad ambiance is not better for a dine-in place but to-go works out fine."}
{"text":"We've been here several times for lunch, always have the gyro pita with greek salad. The salad ingrediants are always fresh with a really good dressing, gyro pita is outstanding, one of the best I've had. Small place, very clean, friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in the whole valley. They have a great variety of Greek and middle eastern food. I love their chicken kabob and recently they started making tabouli salad. It is to die for."}
{"text":"Returned after change in ownership.  New owner (mgr) is VERY rude,  we walked out after attempting to order.  Will NOT BE RETURNING."}
{"text":"Good gyros.  Clean establishment.  Fast and courteous service. We will be back.  Can't wait to try the hummus based on reviews."}
{"text":"Delicious gyro, friendly service and a clean environment. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good gyro. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the Gyros from Munich's and hummus, I have not a yo their items yet, sort of stuck on the gyro with extra pickles right now! Fast pick up and consistently tasty every time."}
{"text":"Met my parents for lunch on their way to Payson. We ate outside since I had brought my puppy with me. After ordering and sitting down one of the servers brought out a bowl of water for her! So sweet. We all had the original Gyro and shared an order of Greek Fries. The food was hot, fresh, and delicious! One of the owners came out after we got done to eating to ask how the food and service was. My mom told him his Gyros are as good as the ones she ordered in New York! We appreciated how sweet the restaurant servers and owners treated us, and for the amazing food they served. The inside was clean and plenty of seating! It was busy while we were there, which I always take as a good sign! We will definitely be going back the next time we are in the Fountain Hills area. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I live in town and never had a chance to go here. I needed something to take on the plane. I ordered the gyro that was cooked to perfection. The tzatziki was on the side. It was very flavorful and tender. It kept well and even though by the time I got to eat it it was cold didn't matter.  It was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"These gyros are fabulous!  Service is awesome.  We even got free baklava delivered to our table.  Heavenly!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there today. The gyros sandwich is excellent, the man who works the front is so friendly and on top of keeping the restaurant neat and the tables cleared. Great value for the sandwich, fries and coke. good food, great value. Love the pita bread they use. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Last place lived prior to Fountain Hills was Amsterdam, and yes, I've spent a lot of time in München. Clean, tidy, quick and delicious.  What more can I say? Very friendly employees and owners.  I grew up with many Greek friends in the midwest, and we have quite a few Persian friends.  So our perspectives of the food offerings are pretty high and this restaurant passes with flying colors!"}
{"text":"We ordered lunch for carry out. We waited 30 minutes for our food. Gyros and chicken kabobs. The food was horrible and the wait was worse. Being from Chicago, so disappointing. We won't be back, ever."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant. Yummy food, cooked quick and fresh. My go to place for a Mediterranean food fix. The staff and owners are always friendly and accommodating. My fave is the Greek salad with gyro meat. My son loves the chicken pita."}
{"text":"Great local place!  If you want fast food don't come here. Their stuff is made fresh and is worth the extra five minutes for the great flavor and freshness!  It doesn't look like much from the street but inside I'm always greeted with a smile, clean restaurant, and great food. A must try and secret gem in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Just had the Philly Gryo with their \"Super hot sauce\" and it was fantastic! We need more places like this is in the valley!!!"}
{"text":"So excited to find this delicious spot to close to our home! Stopped here after work to grab take out and everything came out hot, fresh and amazing. We had the philly gyro, which was the best, a chicken and steak entree plate, falafel and baklava. It was all excellent, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the hidden treasure in Fountain Hills. Under new management this restaurant, under Chef Charbil has made a full u-turn. Now the gyros are moist and tasty and the skewered chicken is incredible... ask for extra magic garlic paste to kick it a notch! The Greek salad is also very flavorful and fresh. Best of all, the hamburger is exceptional, made from pure Angus beef. Best of the best!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find!!! Very friendly people. Super yummy food!!! Very clean. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Found yet another sparkling gem in the Hills!  I always assumed this place was pushing franks with perhaps Greek sides solely based on the name alone. I don't really like hot dogs so I always bypassed. So glad I tried the other night.  I had the Mixed Gyro entree and these guys hit it out if the park! Homemade pita bread served with very generous amounts of chicken and beef. Spices were divine! They served my plate with Tzatziki sauce and hummus - to die for!!!  Can't wait to go back!  Way to make this meal better? Have 2 Grecian Gods named Orion and Adonis feed me by hand while lying on a chaise lounge. And they're wearing small (faux) animal pelts across their privates. Oh, and they can fan me with olive tree branches too."}
{"text":"We ordered the appetizer combo (grape leaves, falafel, with hummus) and a veggie pita, and he even threw in a order of steak fries. I haven't been a huge fan of dolmas in the past, but these made me a believer! Everything tasted fresh and delicious. The owner was very nice and friendly. This place is small, and a true hidden gem."}
{"text":"Decided to update this review simply because this place is fantastic. The food is always amazing and more importantly, it's very consistent! We go here every time we drive through Fountain hills"}
{"text":"We stop here often on our way up to Payson. I love to get the sampler plate and bf gets gyro. Simple selection of Greek basics. Always tastes fresh and staff is nice."}
{"text":"Great stop after mountain biking or enjoying the trails. All food was delicious. The salad is fantastic and the gyro meat tasty. The Falafel with hummus was excellent. This is now our new favorite stop post ride. Doesn't look like much from the outside but with a visit."}
{"text":"The simple exterior hides a gem inside. I had a great gyro combo that was well worth the $8.99. Fresh shaved gyro was generous with ripe tomatoe in December and great tszaki sauce. The spiced fries served were perfectly crisp and tasty.  The restaurant is perfectly clean and comfortable. The owners obviously take pride in their food and the restaurant."}
{"text":"Munich Gyros was highly recommended by my co-worker so I called in my order for take out. The owners were very kind and welcoming. My husband and I ordered the gyro pitas with extra tzaziki sauce and a side of fries. We were very impressed with the generous portions of tasty gyro meat! The pitas were nice and fresh and the fries were cooked nice and crispy seasoned just right. So if you're in the area, drop by and give Munich Gyros a try!"}
{"text":"For a late lunch, a friend and I wanted to try a new place in FH. I see this place every time I come out to play Disc Golf so we decided to give it a try. It is very pleasant inside and the husband and wife owners are wonderful people. Very warm and inviting and the language barrier is not a problem.      We both got the Gyro, his with Fries and mine with a small salad.      The Gyros were packed with juicy fresh meat. Not dry at all. The best part was the Tzatziki sauce. Unlike many places that use yogurt and have a runny sauce, they also include sour cream which makes it thick, rich and far more flavorful.      My small salad was nice and just what I needed.      The star of the meal were the Fries. They weren't your normal square fries. They were flatter and wide. Cooked to a crispy perfection on the outside and hot and creamy on the inside. They are \"The Perfect Fries\". We were beside our selves with joy. I ate half of my friends fries, since he got such a huge portion to go with the big Gyro. They lightly spice them and using some extra Tzakziki sauce made them heavenly. Some Dutch Mayo would have made them even better for my taste.      I ended up getting a Gyro to go for my wife and some of their Homemade Baklava. This was actually the most interesting part of the all of the food. My first bit of the Baklava when I got home almost had me doing back flips. They put in a little Orange Blossom water in their recipe. It was outrageous to say the least. My poor wife only got one piece. Poor girl. I got 3 since I paid for it.       I will be back soon. All 3 items were amazing and I can't wait for some more fries and baklava. This place is worth driving from Mesa for and a great place to go if your coming out to see the Fountain. It's right on the way."}
{"text":"If you want a \"10\" Angus Beef Burger with delicious thick steak fries, then this is the place to go!   The patties are placed on the grill with a big cooking lid over them to not only cook them from underneath but also on top too!  You get 2 big patties on a delicious bun with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cheese, if you want it!   The steak fries are thick and yummy!  You could easily split this meal for it is HUGE!  But, go ahead!  Have one all by yourself!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very good food and excellent service. New owners as of March 1 and they are committed to outstanding customer service!  If you like gyros than this is for you."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Best gyro I have ever had. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Newly increased prices make this a NO GO. $6.99 gyro w/OUT side. The combo is $10.87 after tax!!  In addition, unless you get the extra tzatziki side ($.50) you'll be sorely disappointed as -- inexplicably -- they put the tzatziki on AFTER wrapping the gyro in paper, so only 1/3 of the gyro has any on it!!  Finally, and this is really the most important, the gyro meat is forgettable. Not bad but really just mediocre.   You'll be MUCH happier with George's in Mesa. $6.25 for an amazing gyro WITH fries or huge salad. And the gyro meat is tastier and it's got to be 2x as big as Munich's.  Service here is friendly. Store is clean. But if they continue to overcharge for just OK food I fear they won't make it.   This place seems to take Yelp reviews seriously (they have printed out and posted several reviews -- which by the way are outdated and refer to the previously lower prices) -- so hopefully they'll take this one seriously."}
{"text":"Little place with authentic Greek food.  I like grape leaves but here they are mispriced as if you buy them individually they are .75 each but if you buy them @ the 4.99 price you only get six, you should really get 8 as you can buy 6 individually for $4.50.  Management should check on this.  Gyro I get alone as I am not into fries, wish they had another choice for the gyro plate.  I have to add more onions and chopped tomatoes on mine, as I can hardly find the onion, tomato or lettuce.  Rather than just putting the sauce which is darn good just on the top of the gyros it would be nice if they put in on the top, middle and bottom. Some things for management to address.  I have been eating Gyros for over twenty years, kind of like them with more onions, tomato and lettuce."}
{"text":"Gyros were good, a little pricey. Would have given it 5 stars but the prices are too high. The good was good and the service was great!!! I brought my dog and the lady here brought him out a water cup and wiped down the outside table when we sat - great considering it's a quick stop to eat"}
{"text":"Finally a great place for Gyros in Fountain Hills.  This is a mostly takeout place or a place for a weeknight dinner or a quick lunch.  The decor is a little needy but the food shines.  Freshly made and hot with very good flavor.  We go 3 to 4 times a month so I guess we like it!  5 Stars on the food, 3 on the decor."}
{"text":"First time eating there and it was great. Got a chicken gyro. Hubby got steak gyro. Friends got steak and chicken plates. All very good. Cooked right then when you order. Everything was fresh. The only complaint I have is the side order of fries my husband thought were over cooked. I thought they were fine. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Veggie pita- AWESOME Combo appetizer- DELICIOUS Environment- 10/10 I could eat here 8 days a week and never get tired of it."}
{"text":"Every time I drove past this little gem of a restaurant, I always thought that I needed to stop in. I'm glad I finally did! The food is delicious, and provided with friendly and quick service. The tahini and tzatziki are incredible. I'll definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and ordered a Gyro.  Service was fast and friendly.  Food was delicious.  If you are in the mood for a Gyro definitely worth the trip to fountain hills."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in based on other yelp'ers recommendations. Had the gyro pita a+, order of falafel b+ (different but in a good way, had interesting exterior spice added) covered in hummus which was a+. Place was very clean and well organized."}
{"text":"First - Shawn - the Owner - is amazing! A great chef & a warm personality!  Pam was helpful and FUN! The Hummus - cold was good - but the fresh batch still on the stove - Well Shawn made us up a plate while we waited for our order and it was YUMMY! He combined the 2 with seasoning & oil and poof! A new dish that will be on the menu soon!  Also got a taste of his Garlic Sauce - not the tzaziki - and WOW! Pure, fresh and GARLIC even Emeril would love! (The Tzaziki was good too)  Our Gyros Platters were big and tasty - The fries were well done and seasoned perfectly. I honestly can't think of anything I would change! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After horseback riding at Fort McDowell, my mom and I stopped here for lunch. The food was fantastic! We both had a chicken gyro and it was delicious. The chicken was perfectly tender and seasoned well. The taziki was some of the best I've ever had! We are huge Greek food fans. The two gentlemen that worked here were friendly and the place was tidy. My only suggestion is the Greek fries had feta, but no lemon sauce. I have never had them without it before and I prefer them with sauce."}
{"text":"The food was good and the owners were extra friendly which made us feel food about supporting this business!!"}
{"text":"This place is a whole in the wall next to Circle K, and I assumed it was a greasy spoon. I stopped in with my husband the other day when we needed food in the area quick and I had the falafel pita and french fries. The falafel is really good the hummus and tahini is zingy and the lettuce/tomato/cucumber is really fresh.  This is the best falafel I've found in the valley.  The price is reasonable and the service is friendly. We've been going  three to four times a week.  We're hooked!"}
{"text":"Great and wonderfully fresh food, good portions, excellent service, nice clean establishment!"}
{"text":"We love this place! One of our favorite places to eat in FH! It's a hole in the wall with delicious food. The chicken gyro is great, and the fries are so good! Their hummus on their pita bread in a gyro is to die for!  Clean, good service, friendly, pretty fast, GREAT food."}
{"text":"Ripped off!!! Cashier a liar and added a tip to my to go order!!!  I usually add a small tip on my to go orders when greeted warmly, which i wasn't  there. Just moved in area and will tell everyone i know what happened to me.  Food was okay, but if you want to be ripped off too, this is your place. Oh my, never ever has this happened to me before...just terrible!!!  Found out because i lost my credit card and went over last 5 charges with visa. Yeah, you'll get what you want with a dollop of robbery!!! Sad you can't expect honesty...save your receipts and reconcile with credit card bill  1245pm wed and somewhat busy. Service was just okay by hostess/cashier. Dude making my gyros was much nicer and friendly.  Wedge fries were crisp fresh and plentiful.  Tons of meat and fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions and tiziki.  Took it to go, but place looked comfy and clean enough."}
{"text":"so good, I've been coming here since they opened 4 months ago!!! delicious chicken pitas, the hummus is the best I've ever tasted and the gyros are out of this world with that homemade tzaziki sauce. very friendly staff and the owner is just the sweetest plus they now have watercolors up for sale it looks like a gallery in there!!! get down there for the best and I mean best gyros in Arizona!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up in a very Greek community outside of Chicago.  I know Greek food, I was raised going to the Greek diners and Greektown in Chicago.  I can't review any food other than the gyros because I have never made it past that menu item.  The meat is perfectly spiced and roasted.  The posts are soft and hold together pretty well, which is saying something because the stuff them full.  There is a perfect ratio of meat to onions, lettuce, tomatoes and taziki sauce.  Get the gyro special because the thick cut fries are fantastic as well.  They bring back fond memories of home.  The restaurant is always spotless and the owner and staff are very friendly.  We will be making this a permanent stop.  My only complaint is the location.  The corner is always super busy with traffic coming and going in several directions at once; filling gas at circle k, going to McDonald's, as well as Redendo's and Senior Taco.  I see several near misses every time I go."}
{"text":"We ate here for dinner and it was excellent! The service was really friendly and relaxed. The portions are generous. We had the appetizer sampler and everything was great. I especially loved the hummus. I also has the Greek salad with gyros meat and it was delicious. :) my husband got the mixed plate. The chicken had a ton of flavor. And they even gave us a little dessert. Thank you! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great Fresh Greek Food! alway friendly service, it's my top notch spot for a gyro if i'm in the area. family owned and operated. And you can tell they put love into the food. it's a great hole in the wall place to visit or get it to go.  Newly remodeled, super clean and comfy. I love this place. The food and service has never let me down for a second.   Stop by and support this amazing locally owned business!"}
{"text":"We came in today to have lunch and were thrilled with the food. The place is small but mighty in flavor! You can dine in or take out like we did.   What we got:  - two gyro specials (gyro, steak fries, and drink) for $9.98 [What a killer deal] - chicken pita (soooooooo good).   My bf said the gyro meat was spiced perfectly and he snarfed that thing down before I could even blink! The chicken was cooked to perfection and had a really nice spice blend that married sooooo well with the tzatziki sauce, lettuce, onions, and tomatoes.   The fellow who was preparing the food was very nice and got us our food so quickly it was still hot when we got home. What a nice little surprise for Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in the Scottsdale/Fountain Hills area. Best value. The combo gyro comes with fries and a coke but you can get their wonderful Greek salad (enough to share) if you ask instead of the fries. Not just gyros. An extensive menu and everything is good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Decent Greek food. Got the falafel salad and the falafels were dry. Ordered a side of chicken since the falafels weren't great. It was extremely bland. My parents loved their chicken pita sandwich and gyros though."}
{"text":"We came here due to great YELP reviews and dog friendly seating out front. We were not disappointed. We had Lemono soup, Greek salad and appetizer platter. The soup was lemony without being overpowering and was not overly creamy like some can be. The salad lettuce was very fresh and the dressing was well balanced. Appetizer platter had hummus, tatziki, dolmades, and falafel, pita slices, all were excellent. The service was outstanding and the (owner?) even brought out water and dog biscuits for our dog. If you find yourself in fountain hills, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Really excellent Mediterranean-style food! Very clean operation (front and back of the house), and very consistent on food quality."}
