{"text":"Place is clean and simple, owners are friendly, drinks and food are satisfying.

This place specialize in Hong Kong style cart noodles and they do a fine job. The soup base is not too salty (owner said they don't add MSG), I never got dry throat after eating at Little Honey. The bubble milk tea is unexpectedly good.

They also offer other HK style snacks. I like their waffle (????? with peanut butter, condensed milk and a touch of sugar)......brought back a lot of sweet childhood memories :)

The place is relatively new and they still have rooms for improvment but definitely worth a try if you would like to have a taste of authentic HK style food.

Note: Patrons are allowed to park at the condo's underground parking."}
{"text":"TL;DR DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS PLACE.

For the month of October, they have earlier opening hours. So I decided to check it out in the early afternoon as I was craving some egg waffles.

Upon entry, an extremely rude lady asked me why I was there. I walked over to the counter and told her I'm going to take a look at the menu first. And she kept saying \"hah?!?\" I had to repeat myself 3 times.
Then she hands me a menu and said that in the morning they only serve these items (proceeds to point to the top part of the menu). Then as I was taking a look, she says, \"all sold out.\"

OK, so then I asked her if egg waffles are available. \"No,\" she replies. No mention of why, no mention of when they typically serve them. Why the heck are they open then?

If that lady was the owner, there is a LONG way to go to make this place work. Otherwise, I can't imagine this place staying in business for much longer."}
{"text":"A hidden bubbletea shop in between a chinese resturant and a convenience store. on Enterprise and Birchmount. I thought I'd give this place a try.
 
I ordered a milk tea with tapioca to-go half sweet. When my order came out I was surprised!. Although the store was called \"little honey tea shop\"  they still seem to use Teashop 168's take-out cups... only managed to put a sticker over the cups (talk about cheap).... Branding aside. The bubble tea was horrific a bit worse than the varieties you would buy at Foodymart or a random chinese resturant that tries to expand their buseiness by making lousy bubble teas. If I could give this place a grade I'd give it an \"F\"

Atmosphere: Looks exactly like what it is , small and clean

Food/Drink: powdery and watered down...I wish I spent the extra two bucks to go to chatime across the street or the aroma

honestly A LOT OF WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of HK style egg waffles, so when I saw the sign from the window facing Birchmount, I knew I wanted to try Little Honey Tea Shop. It's under a condo with a few street parking spots and apparently more underground though the idea of having to find the underground (not knowing whether I needed to get a parking pass from the condo) made me hesitant. 

Despite the proximity to the Markham theater, Little Honey was very empty on a hot Saturday. I ordered an egg waffle which is a whopping $4.50! Everywhere else it's generally $3 for one and $5 for 2. While there were no other customers, it was also a very long wait - I imagine it's because the egg waffles machine is not usually on due to the traffic and needed heating up. It also tastes pretty underwhelming and not crunchy enough. 

Little Honey also has HK style cart noodles which is basically create-your-own noodles with HK style ingredients.  The price is dependent on what you add to the noodles. There's nothing special about the noodles, but that's consistent with food at other bubble tea places. 

On the bright side, because it's a very quiet place, this would not be a bad place to come to in order to get some work or studying done. This alone deserves 1 star because I find it hard to sit for a long time at other bubble tea places like chatime.  I also hope Little Honey will improve over time as I'd like to support non-chain places. I may give Little Honey another try a the end of the summer."}
{"text":"Came here on an evening stumbled upon this business who took over the former teashop 168. Atmosphere: Dead the workers/owners were on their phones looking very unproductive. Ordered two milk teas/no ice and curry fish/beef balls... I can honestly say the quality was the worst I had ever tasted not only relativity to bubble tea and snacks but to food in general. This is the kind of food and drinks they would feed inmates in Guantanamo Bay! The curry fish balls and curry beef balls were not edible and tasted rancid as if they were sitting out for weeks, while the two large milk teas I ordered were tasteless and served piping-hot. This was without a doubt the worst experiences I've had at one of your establishments the food quality is questionable and I may consider contacting Public health inspection (York Safe)

- extremely disappointed and jaded ( I cant drink bbt anymore)"}

Price: Affordable --- Satisfied 

'Add oil!!\" Great Job, keep it on and we hope your business are getting better and more people know this lovely place for people who love HK snacks and cart noodle!!!!"}
{"text":"A brand new open place that needs lots lots lots lots more dedication and work to improve.

The price was relatively low but not worth a second try or maybe regretting after seeing the bowl of noodle arriving. 

Location: parking was a bit difficult as it's just limited and one way direction. 

Setting: typically plain and clean

Price: average low, food quantity was extra small 

Taste: bubble tea tasted water down and tapioca is over cooked. Noodle and soup was not their strength. The intention for the Cafe was \"cart noodle\" where noodles are supposed to be served in speed and go-go-go tempo. However this didn't happen, maybe of slower customer flow that requires time to reheat the side dishes."}
{"text":"This place took over the space previously occupied by Tea Shop 168 in the Downtown Markham area. Hubby and I came in as they happened to be open on a holiday Monday and were open to trying them despite the one bad Yelp review. They have a buy one, get one bubble tea special. Tapioca is included in the price ($3.99 for regular size, $4.99 for large size).

The restaurant was pretty empty except for one non-Asian patron who was ordering food for takeout. There is lots of room for studying or hanging out with friends, and they have free wifi. 

This place specializes in snacks and HK style cart noodle soup. You build your own noodle soup by choosing a noodle ($2-4), choosing your sauce/base, as well as additional toppings (extra $1-$2.50 per topping) or side snacks ($2 per order). This order comes with complimentary drink (HK milk tea, HK coffee, tea/coffee mix, lemon water, or lemon tea), or you can upgrade your drink to a bubble tea or cold beverage for additional cost.

Despite the previous review, I didn't find the bubble tea undrinkable. It simply fell short of the standards of the major Taiwanese bubble tea chains in terms of the chewiness of the tapioca and strength of the tea, but for BOGO, it wasn't bad and the bubble waffle was decent and crispy. The owners were open to feedback about the tapioca and were friendly. 

Would consider returning to try other snacks."}
