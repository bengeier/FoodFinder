{"text":"Great little bar when you're in the mood to shoot pool, play darts/shuffleboard, or just pump money into the music machine. Great liquor selection.  Food is fine but nothing to write home about.  I've had nothing but great experiences with the service. Teaser: one of the staff is an Olympic gold medalist - no lie. Real sport, too!  Definitely stop in to grab a beer if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Worst bar I have ever been to. Terrible food, terrible service. I hated this place. The bartender that was serving me was extremely condescending like it was me who was providing a service. Furthermore the locals were really rowdy and just disrespectful to people who they did not recognize. I even had multiple drinks placed onto my card by other people who were in the establishment and the bartender DID NOT confirm this with me. He just la-dee-da swiped it. I refused to pay and was furious that he would even think that was ok. He said he was going to swipe it anyway because it was on my tab... He decided not to when I offered the possibility of law enforcement to come fix the situation. He didn't as well because it was announced multiple times that there were underage patrons drinking and within the bar. This place should not be allowed to function at all anymore and I will never be returning to this place ever again."}
{"text":"Good fish fry. Good cocktails. What more could you ask for? First, you could ask the cockroaches in here to get out. Second, you could ask for better service. A while back, there were some nice bartenders, but now, ehhhhh... Third, you could ask to turn the music volume down. It's disturbingly loud in here. Try it if you get the chance."}
{"text":"This is a fish fry review.  Someone said the fish fry was decent at Cahoots so I figured I would stop in on a Friday and check it out as I'm on the hunt for the best one in the area.  I'm a dive bar kind of guy, so initial entry didn't put me off. Service was quick as I sat at the bar, but being I'm in something of a dive, I'm not expecting politeness. I just ordered, had a beer and waited.  The food came quickly, but it just wasn't very good.  I had battered cod with a double baked (?) potato, a dinner roll and coleslaw. The fish was overdone and on the chewy side, a common problem on a busy Friday night in Wisconsin. The potato was nothing to write home about; fair at best but nothing I would order again. The slaw was good enough and the roll just fine.   The best way to describe the fish fry here would be exactly what Yelp! gives for a two-star review: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" This fish fry isn't anything to write home about, but as a bar it's just fine."}
{"text":"Great bar, great people, great service! First off, the guy that wrote the bad review is writing it for the wrong place cause Cahoots has never taken credit cards so (pun intended) that guy's credit is questionable.  Anyway, all of their appetizers are great, I've had the fish fry and it is tasty and filling (get the baked potato), I've never ordered a sandwich there so can't rate those.  Overall an awesome place to get a drink or ten. Fun bartenders who actually enjoy getting you your drinks. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Two stars because of service.  We went on a Friday night for fish, and the food was really good, the service was atrocious!  Perch dinner was hot and very tasty.  Comes with fries or baked potato, roll and coleslaw.  When we got our food there was no coleslaw so I asked our server if we were suppose to have it.  He said they ran out.  That was it, no sorry, no offer to substitute, no price reduction.  We never were offered water, nor were we asked if we would like a second drink.  In fact after dropping the bill right after bringing our food he never came back at all.   Then there was the issue of \"Cash Only\".  I think that should be posted on the front door, not a small sign behind the bar.  We would carry out fish from there, but will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to hang out if you find yourself in Verona.  Local hangout, good selection of Wisconsin brewed mainstay cans and bottles (hamms, PBR), some microbrews, as well as a few decent taps (Capital).  Thay have pool, darts, and shuffleboard. They also have a few large TV's, poker machines, and jukebox.  They do have some food as well.         FYI- they do not take cards, but have an ATM available."}
