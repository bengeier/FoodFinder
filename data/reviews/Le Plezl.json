{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was more than impressed with this little cafe on McGill's campus.  The salmon sandwich I had was pleasantly spiced and well put together.  The split pea soup was tasty and filled with vegetables.  The brownie was wonderful!  The service was friendly and they answered all the questions I had.  I hope to get back there before I depart for home."}
{"text":"Good prices - friendly people. Inside he McGill Chabad house. Easily the most convenient kosher option if you are staying in a downtown hotel."}
{"text":"Incredible food. One of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever had. For dessert the fresh out of the oven chocolate eclair donut was crispy filled with lots of custard topped with delicious chocolate-incredible. You must eat here!!"}
