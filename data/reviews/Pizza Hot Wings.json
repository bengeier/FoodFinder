{"text":"Terrible service, gave our pizza to some other guys. Don't come back this place is garbage"}
{"text":"Total trash. When Sweeney Todd sang about \"There's a hole in the world like a big black pit who are filled with people who are filled with shit\" he had this place in mind. This store has been a revolving door of different pizzaria's with different owners in the past 5 years. This is just the latest in a long line of failed businesses. Here's what's wrong:

- tasteless, bland pizza with a crust so disgusting it's probably in violation of the geneva convention. 
- incredibly rude staff, you'd think they were professional social media trolls.
- long wait time despite very few customers

I suspect that there's some agency out there using this business as a front to help immigrants score points to gain citizenship or something; it's the only explanation for the lack of actual restaurant skills or regards for sanitation."}
{"text":"Staff are very kind and friendly, the owner is very personable and a delight to deal with. Prices are very very good. Good quality is quite good when factoring in the price. I find some items better then others. The shish kabob is good, I really like their wings, pretty saucy though so prepare for some dirt hands.  Their pizza average. Not bad by any means. 

All in all I've ordered there quite a few times and it's always a pleasure dealing with them. 

Oh, and they have free delivery!"}
{"text":"Contrary to what people are saying here I purchased a large pizza for pick up tonight and I found it as one of the better pizzas I've had so far in the area! I had the 3 topping special - tandoori chicken, hot peppers, and salami with the garlic dip.. which I also enjoyed! For less than 12 bucks I was very satisfied. The guy who served me was also very nice! Not sure why there are so many negative reviews. I will definitely order again and hopefully will receive the same experience ! This was my first time ordering here."}
{"text":"Very kind staff. No attitude when I had no phone working because I have a USA phone carrier. Got there in good time and still had super good food. Also their wings are naked (no breading) which is awesome for my friend who is on The Keto diet. I will definitely be eating here again the next time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, there were no customers, but I notice they have a lot more delivery orders. I saw their flyer here on Yelp and decided to try one of their walkin specials, which is a chicken burger for $2.99. My BF got a medium salad ($2.99) and a barbecue chicken leg for $2.99.

Food came in 10 minutes and they already made an error as they forgot to make the barbeque chicken leg that we ordered AND also forgot to bill us for that. So we had to wait another 5 minutes for the chicken leg and make another transaction to pay for that. They simply forgot.

I was disappointed at how small the chicken is on the chicken burger, the bun was wayy too big but the chicken is very small and thin. You get what you pay for.

While we were eating and waiting for the bbq chicken leg, we heard the microwave. So I am not sure if that was used to make the chicken. Now I am not sure if the chicken leg is made fresh. Just a thought.

Salad is okay and the bbq chicken leg is ok. Could of been a bit more bigger.

Not coming back, as there are wayyy more options out there that are fresher and tastier for the same price."}
