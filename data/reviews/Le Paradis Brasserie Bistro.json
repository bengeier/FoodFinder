{"text":"excellent, authentic French bistro--decor is 70's basement meets bistro, but truly one of our neighbourhood favourites. Wonderful fish, affordable wine, creative desserts. We keep returning and have never had a bad meal in 7 years."}
{"text":"It's the second Toronto's French restaurant I am eating in, and it is a second  great evening! To begin with, people were packed on the patio so we could enjoy the luxe, calme et volupté of the cool backroom. By the way, people saying that this place has the feel of a french bistro obviously never went to a french bistro. It looks more like a New Jersey pizzeria. The day when french bistros (or brasseries) will have AC, sofas and fake renaissance paintings, Sarkozy will be president. Second, some kind of Yorkville nouveau riche sent back his bottle of St Emilion probably because it was tasting like wine, so we had it for half the price, and by itself it justified the name of the place. Third, the waitress had the real french attitude with all the appropriate french frowns and scowls that challenge you to be so funny that she will eventually smile. Finally the food was amazing. Sardines grillées and jarret d'agneau à la Marocaine for me. Lots of food, great food, good times!"}
{"text":"Great place for a traditional fresh french bistro meal. Wine list was good - great service too. The duck was a little overdone so I'd say head over for an earlier meal. They cater to an older crowd who dines earlier it seemed."}
{"text":"This is a cozy french restaurant. It is the closest to a typical french restaurant you can find in France in Toronto. I've had the charcuterie and escargot to start. For the main, I've tried the salmon, the travers de boeuf, and the foie de veau. Everything was tasty. I've been with a group of 6 or more multiple times and we've always had a good time."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Toronto I always go to this resto, the staff are amazing and the food is epic. The wine selection is well thought out and the atmosphere is really something else. I have dropped from $80 to $1200 which speaks to how this place can accommodate people from all walks of life."}
{"text":"Absolutely brilliant!    You MUST reserve a table here if you expect to eat on a Thurs, Fri, Sat as this place is popular and well known for it's extremely good cuisine and extremely reasonable prices.    I had a wonderful meal here with a stunning wine and it was not too expensive. While we did not have a reservation, we were able to get a table at the front which, while drafty is at least a table at this magnificent place.    The traditional French menu is a delight and the wait staff are perfect.    I would not hesitate to recomment this to my best friends, and hide it from my enemies :-)"}
{"text":"Comfort French food is what Le Paradis does. I still enjoy the food after first coming here 15 years ago. The relatively new brunch is excellent and very reasonably priced. At too many T.O. restaurants the noise level is so high it's utterly impossible to have a meaningful conversation with one's dining companions. Not so at Le Paradis. The music here is never intrusive. Ironically, this may be a negative to younger people who seem to prefer deafening noises in restos. Anyway, the food is dependably good. This place is a classic."}
{"text":"My favorite so far in the T.O. It's the most complete, and consistent experience in the city. Well priced, and fresh. I had romantic dinners, family, and with children... every time was a great time. Tailored service. I just can get enough."}
{"text":"Good food and great menu! I had the lamb shank and thought it was quite delicious minus a couple burnt Rosemary leaves. I wish they came around more often with the bread. Overall, highly recommended and a great place for a date."}
{"text":"Recently met friends here for dinner and was extremely disappointed in the service. I would give it more stars, because the meal itself was adequate, but the two wait staff we endured throughout the evening made, even that, miserable. The servers gave every possible indication that they were way too busy to actually serve us. We waited far too long for everything from initial contact to food arrival. When asked about reasons for the poor service I got extremely rude responses from the staff. It was an evening of struggle and anger. Just what we all want for our night out with friends, n'est pas? I think not! Won't be back for several lifetimes."}
{"text":"This place serves excellent Bistro food in an unpretentious manner. You come here for the food and great value for money, not to hang out at some trendy joint .... I've never had a bad meal here and the prices are soooo reasonable. It's definitely one of my go to places in town. Can't fault it really."}
{"text":"Walking into Le Paradis I got a little memory of Paris... Starting with the waitress who spoke to us in French, as soon as we walked in, and keeping true throughout the dinner, with French decor, French-language plats de jour scribbled on the blackboard, to the authentic French dishes and wines on the menu.  The food was terrific. Everyone in our party ordered from the daily specials and we all saw different ways that French finesse and taste was brought forward. The homemade smoked salmon was scented with fennel and lime and was intriguing. The mussels in white wine sauce were surprisingly addictive. The plate of warm salt cod and potato, part of the regular menu, was subtle and intriguing.  The highlights were the main dishes and the wine. I had a \"Cote de porc facon Train Bleu\". For those not in the know, the Train Bleu is one of Paris' most exclusive restaurants at the Gare de Lyon train station, actually situated right inside the train station. The porc was nicely Frenched (bone trimmed) and was decorated with a slab of perfectly grilled and melted swiss cheese on top and surrounded by a beautiful red wine sauce.   The wine was a Premier Cru Chablis, at only $50, which is unheard of in Toronto.   We ended up with a cheese plate (bravo!) and a fabulous coconut ice cream with bananas and chocolate, with just the perfect amount of everything blanaced to perfection.  By the way, the staff were amazing and very cordial. A combination of French pride and also friendliness..."}
{"text":"Cela fait plus de deux ans qu'on écume les restaurants français de Toronto et c'est définitivement celui qui offre le meilleur rapport qualité/prix et qui ressemble vraiment à de la nourriture que l'on pourrait vous servir dans une brasserie de qualité ou un restaurant en France. La carte n'est pas trop farfelue, on trouve de bons plats, faits simplement sans trop d'artifice mais avec goût. Le service est attentionné et vraiment amical. Je trouve que ce restaurant est sous-estimé dans les avis et qu'il mérite qu'on parle plus souvent de lui, tout du moins, dans la communauté francophone ! Bonne continuation."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Limited menu, so the choice is simpler to do :-) nice athmosphere."}
{"text":"I went for steak frites on a weeknight and it was good. The peppercorn sauce not spicy thank goodness but more like the one from L'entrecote in Paris which is what I was looking for.  Salad was fresh and dressing tasty. I was happy after the steak and salad.  I live in annex so easier to get here than Le Select Bistro and my son and I did not want to dress up or deal with financial district but wanted somewhere more chill to eat steak frites. Could have tried places south of us but we were going out for steak last minute and so the trendy places in Ossington or Dundas or On W Queen W were out. This place fit the bill. Good food without any happening scene /-/- We just wanted our steak frites and then going home to do regular weeknight stuff. School the next day for my son. Me not wanting to cook.  Should have skipped dessert. Desserts were disappointing. Chocolate mousse turned it to be chocolate pate and the creme brûlée came from the fridge vs freshly burned as the sugar broke apart into pieces easily.  I would not order dessert again but would come for the steak frites and salad. Will try Pinot noir by glass vs the merlot which was very fruity. No red Bordeaux by the glass which is my usual. But I need to branch out!  Service was ok but slow for a bistro. Having said that the  servers seemed to rush whenever at table. I expect this in a bistro in any case so was not disappointed. But the staff seemed to literally be running all over the place. Seemed short staffed.  There is main part of restaurant that is loud and looks like a bistro. Open kitchen makes for a fun dining experience.  Then there is a quieter room with carpet and subterranean. If you want the atmosphere of a bistro then be sure they don't seat you in the quiet room.  No parking in area except a couple streets that are usually full. So best to uber or walk."}
{"text":"Food was very solid bistro. Steak like butter, bourguignon was spectacular. Frites a must! Mouse was devastatingly good.   Loud atmosphere, with happy but distracted service.  Would recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"I've known this place for 20+ years, and it once was OK, perhaps even good... but that was in the 1990s. I went back while visiting Toronto (having returned 12 years ago to QC). Total disappointment. Banal, dreary, tacky. Food just altogether mediocre... overall ambience was that of a tourist trap such as one finds in provincial cities  ... tho perhaps that was due to the abundance of boring, obnoxious Toronto people who obviously tolerate the lousy food here. The staff are lovely and the service is OK, but unless you want to have the sort of restaurant experience one might have expected in obscure parts of Britain decades ago (think Fawlty Towers--especially in terms of the quality of the cuisine!), just steer clear. It boggles my kind, because Toronto has so many good restaurants.... !"}
{"text":"I went to dinner at Le Paradis about a week ago and I'm still thinking about the food. Le Paradis falls into the fancier restaurants that I've been to, but I felt quite comfortable and relaxed dining there. The atmosphere and service was very cozy and friendly.  I had the lamb shank for dinner and it was very tasty. The N. African spices didn't overpower the lamb and they came together wonderfully. The lamb came with sides of couscous and vegetables were also very tasty and were perfect for the lamb.   For dessert I had the creme caramel, which was silky and delicious. I wish that they would have served creme brule instead, but I'm not complaining!  Usually you will find me at more casual restaurants or pubs, but I'm very glad I changed it up and came to Le Paradis. For the dining experience I was certainly expecting to pay more. I'd love to come back and try their other dishes.  PS. First review. I signed up on Yelp just to give this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We went here with another couple for a late night dinner.  The food, service and ambiance was fantastic. great little brasserie. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food is superb and extremely rich in the French tradition. The service is like what you would get in the Seinfeld's soup Nazi episode. I wasn't sure if they were acting or not. But I sure never established any rapport with the woman who slapped down menus before us like a seasoned Las Vegas card dealer, eyes fixed indifferently away from you. But the food was elegant and I guess that's why I went there.  It was an experience."}
{"text":"I liked the vibe of this place. I visited for the first time with friends and it seems to be a popular place. My meal was fantastic and our waitress was excellent which always makes your dining experience all the more memorable. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have probably eaten in over 1000 restaurants in my life. I have never met such rude, ignorant and unhelpful waiters in all my life as I did in this restaurant this past Saturday night. They acted like we were bothering them when we asked them for drinks. My wife actually had to get up and walk to get one of the waiters to get their attention. I could not believe it. The unfriendly attitude, along with a menu that is average at best, shouts two words: STAY AWAY. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Truly authentic. Another steadfast and reliable restaurant over the years. A regular for family gatherings, particularly when the in-laws are of French stock. Many of the servers speak French fluently and the cocktails always have a French (Canadian) slant. French service without your table being crummed. Always relaxed and friendly, the service here is great.  Cet bistro était un bijou caché. Il est proche de mon cur, et de mon ventre."}
{"text":"I went there with a few friends a couple of nights ago. It was a nicer restaurant. The staff was polite and friendly, and a great feature was that there was not laud music. We were a group of 35-45 years old people, and I can say that with a good margin, we were the youngest people there, although we went there after 8:30 pm on a Sat. night! Maybe one reason for the quiet and relatively classy atmosphere was that, or maybe its classy atmosphere was why lots of seniors were there. :-) We liked it anyways and enjoyed our time and food. Our waitress was also very polite and caring.  My only two complaints are, 1) we had to wait for ~20 minutes for a table to get empty, even though we had a reservation, and 2) although all my friends enjoyed their food, I found my burger a bit raw (personal taste since I think it twas more than well done for the French cuisine) and too salty. Other than that, every thing was great!"}
{"text":"I just came here today and was very impressed. The hostess may have been a touch stuck up, but our server was lovely and totally made up for it.  We had an early dinner seating on a Sunday night, so we were the youngest people in the room by about 40 years or so. The menu, from what I understand, is rather seasonal and the plats du jour make up about a third of the total offerings, I would guess.  I started with the tartiflette from the du jour menu, which involved potato, bacon and cheese. What's not to like? It did have a strange handful of fresh greens on top, but I wasn't complaining. My husband ordered the same and our friend had the charcuterie, which we shared. It was also pretty good, though not at all memorable.  For the main, I had my standby French order - cassoulet. The confit au canard wasn't as impressive as the one at Le Select Bistro, but it was still well prepared and delicious.  We couldn't believe how well priced the desserts were, so we couldn't pass up ordering the creme caramel (yummy and about 5\" in diameter by 1\" thick), flourless chocolate cake with almond, and cheese plate to share between the three of us. We were all pleased with our choices.  The recommended red wine went well with the meal, and was reasonably priced, the food was very reasonably priced. I will definitely come here again the next time I crave French food."}
{"text":"First dinner there in some years, very! disappointing, Cassoulet was horrible, cremated Duck Leg, burnt small sausage and entirely overdone, Cold hard bread and a frozen rock of butter.  Lamb Shank was also overdone and salted within an inch of its life, The Waitress,on the other hand was lovely.  Another overrated disappointing Toronto restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrific food, terrific staff. Really nice space and place.  Would be a 5 star only we didn't get the table we preferred because the place was so damn busy.  I had the mussels in white wine and the beouf bourguignon - 2 French bistro standards and both very very good. Thank you Le Paradis!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is recommended, so there we go.  I ordered the Pave de Boeuf au Poivre, as told by the waiter that it is not the most tender one but very tasteful with strong seasoning. I myself find it a bit oily. The fries come with plate are one of the best. The dessert is good.   Service is very friendly. Although we booked at a much later time, due to schedule changes we are accommodated to an earlier seating.  If during a warm day, the patio is excellent as it sits on a quiet street with lots of greens around."}
{"text":"Up in the sky among Angels and Stars...Le Paradis.  Food is properly prepared right in front of you, the kitchen is right there. I can smell and taste the food even before it reaches my table. It feels like a true Bistro', simply the real thing...good food, and Incredible value for the price. Of course you can find many good bistros in toronto, but not the same value for the price.  I keep coming back, and knocking on heaven's door over and over again. I know, a reservation is suggested...but I often find a little table available..."}
{"text":"Great bustling bistro, a real workhorse of a bistro with nice service and a cosy feel.  Food is usually quite good and reasonably priced cant go wrong with this-ol faithful!"}
{"text":"Le Paradis has been serving up French fare for a long, long time. We showed up on Saturday night without a reservation, they were busy but able to accommodate us right away.  I started with PEI mussels in white wine, garlic, and shallots ($8). I hope you like shallots. I was hungry and kept sipping the broth. With each sip, the shallots became more and more intense. I stopped with the sipping and I asked for more fresh bread instead.  The red pepper soup was creamy and indeed peppery ($5), not overly exciting.  I ordered the lamb shank braised in Belgian ale ($19). My friend had the boeuf bourguignonne ($18).  I wanted the bourguignonne, but I didn't order it because my friend did. It was stupidly tender and tasty!   Next time, I'd ordering it!  (growl face) Unless I get the steak frites.  We had the chocolate flourless cake for dessert. Moist and heavy chocolate.  It was good but not fantastic.  I can't help but compare Le Paradis to some of the newer and more modern French-styled bistros.  Le Paradis has it's charm, I'd take my mother here, but not a date.  Well, there were a few older couples here on dates.  They probably took their original partners here like 20 years ago... and the restaurant probably hasn't changed much!  However, I see why people like this place.  Great value and fantastic service.  Now they just need steak tartare."}
{"text":"Forewarning: I am picky when it comes to my French food.   After a night of working late, I decided to try Le Paradis out, knowing that I would be there quite close to their closing time.   I was disappointed.   We ordered the assiette de charcuteries to start. Everything was stone cold. Again - it was a late hour, but (in my humble opinion) the terrine and pate should be served at room temperature. I really felt the flavours were masked by the coldness (or maybe they were bland to begin with). I wouldn't order this again.   We shared our mains: boeuf bourguignonne and the duck leg. The beef was just OK - it was tender, but missed out on some of the flavour and richness of the liquid. The duck leg was delicious.   For dessert, I had the flourless chocolate cake, and was expecting a mound of ooey gooey but found it a bit dry.   The prices are great - but certainly you can find better French elsewhere. I'd like to try  this place again during the dinner hour when I have more choice  (they were out of a few items on the menu). I do like that the menu changes daily - perhaps the next time, I'll find a gem."}
{"text":"Bad service, the waitress actually banged glasses on the table. When a cocktail that was not on the list was requested the answer was a categorical no, not let me check.  Place was dirty- don't look up at the dust hanging from the ceiling.  Food was actually good. But not worth dealing with grumpy people."}
{"text":"I had a lot of high expectations for this bistro, but was left quite disappointed! So 3.5 stars for this place  The decor of the bistro was really cool; posters of French aperitifs as well of vistas of Paris and the French countryside. The lighting was soft and the seating was comfortable.  We were greeted in an incredibly friendly manner and, despite being child unfriendly (or not suitable for children!), my 10 month old niece was made to feel more than welcome as was the other infant that came afterwards. In fact, everyone was very friendly and there nothing I can fault regarding the service. And that's worth the 2.5 stars. The other star is for the pêche royale, which was delicious and a good suggestion on the part of our hostess!  Other than that, I didn't find the food very good. Nothing spectacular on my part nor on the part of my dining companions.   Too bad, but it was a nice place for a family brunch all the same!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I've maybe eaten at 5 french restaurants in my entire life - one of them being the Paris Paris buffet in Las Vegas ... so, my understanding of what constitutes good french cuisine is pretty limited.  That being said, I love Le Paradis!  Food was fantastic!!!  I had the lamb shanks with scalloped potatoes.  Portion was huge!  Had a taste of the seafood stew - OMG, so good.  Appetizers were mussels - yum - and pate and fois gras - which I enjoyed until my mom reminded me of how foie gras was made :(  I could not eat another bite after that.  The complimentary bread and butter was one of the best complimentary bread and butters I have ever tried!  The butter was absolutely delicious...  Prices are extremely reasonable.  Entrees are about 15 - $20 which is a steal considering the quality and quantity of food.  Atmosphere is friendly and bustling.  I could hear french being spoken all around.  The lighting is warm, soft, and flattering.  We sat in the non-reservation section of the restaurant so we were directly in front of the kitchen.  So unfortunately, we left the restaurant with our clothes and hair smelling really smoky."}
{"text":"Beautiful little French bistro with a wonderful patio in the back.  The weather was perfect and the sheltered patio made it very comfortable.  We had a reservation, which was good, since it was quite busy.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and steered us in the right direction for our meals.  The wine was reasonably priced.  I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"We walked in without reservations on a Saturday night but was still seated quickly.  Two different couples in front of us were speaking french to each other which I take as a good sign that the real french people seem to like this place.  The PEI muscles were amazing, fresh tasting, juicy and of a good size.  It came in a muscle broth mixture of red and white onions, herbs and butter that served to complement the muscles well.  For the main I had the shortbread which was my first time trying pancreas, so I was not blown away with it.  But my date had the duck condif which was sublime.  It was a tad over fried, but the duck as tender and tasted great overall.  The chips it came with was also surprisingly yummy too.  Overall a great French experience!  I should note that their floors are kind of slippery as we noticed when we first walked in.  Through the night we saw two different guests slip near the steps near thee bathroom, before staff finally laid down a carpet on the spot."}
{"text":"My parents are a big fan of this place and finally brought me for dinner.  A random Monday night at 7 and the restaurant was almost fully booked, with only 1 or 2 open tables.  There was even a couple sitting on the patio in the 10-12 degree weather (that's in Celsius, which is not patio weather for Californians).  To start, we shared the mussels and the gravlax (cured salmon) which were very good and 2 appetizers were enough for 4 ppl.  Our main courses were the duck leg in a wine reduction, roasted chicken, calf liver and onions and a spicy seafood stew.  My favourites were the roasted chicken that was very tasty and the spicy stew.  The calf liver was sweet but some parts were a little tough.  The duck leg tasted good too, but was a little over cooked for me.  One of the favourite parts of the meal, according to my brother and father, was the butter and bread.  The butter actually had a very smooth texture and taste.  I'll probably go again because they are constantly changing the menu and so many people I talk to LOVE this place."}
{"text":"You might as well know right away that the servers are not going to charm you. These are not college kids hoping to ingratiate themselves in exchange for a generous tip. These are professional servers and you really shouldn't waste their time with questions about the food - and don't even think about asking for ketchup for the frites (we didn't).  So, with that knowledge, you should know that you will want to come again and again despite the brusque service - or is it french service - or is it both? Anyway, you will want to come again because ooh la la, la cuisine c'est bon! Every morsel of it is splendid. And those servers indifferent to making a positive impression on you with friendly chit chat will ensure that nothing distracts you from enjoying the perfect meal perfectly served.   Make reservations because it fills up fast. Bring a thick skin."}
{"text":"I think that Le Paradis is one of the best brasseries in Toronto. it's straight up French fare in a true bistro environment (complete with paper tablecloths, but we'll get to this later). Service is traditional French, a bit stiff, but always helpful.  This place is great for romance, but also for larger groups. The prices are very reasonable-- even for the wine. If they have the Chicken Liver Mouuse, I always order this as it's proper french meat in a pot. Yum. The Rabbit Stew is delicious with green olives and lots of french herbs. Seafood Boulliabaise/Stew is great value and always fresh and delicious. I also am a huge fan of the liver and sweetbreads if I get there before they sell out.  Flourless Chocolate cake is absolute perfection.   My only compliant with Le Paradis is the paper on the tables. I know its economical and keeps the white linen clean. I'm also aware that many bistros in Paris do this. It's just a personal thing-- I don't like it. The last time we went my boyfriend went out on a limb and tried the sweetbread in Puff Pastry for his entree. To be fair, I think sweetbreads should never be covered with pastry-- the flavour and texture is so delicate that the buttery pastry overwhelms the meat. Even smoked, they couldn't stand up. Probably the only thing that wasn't fantastic here.  it's my go to French restaurant. I like it old school and I cherish my wine and offal. I can find it all here-- en papillotte."}
{"text":"We came here on a Weds evening, drawn in by the good reviews (also helped that it was on the way to Loblaws).  I liked this place right away, the entire staff was warm and friendly and we were quickly seated at an outside table.  If you eat here and the weather is nice, do your best to sit on the patio as it's really nice.    While the atmosphere and service were suburb, they royally screwed up my trout.  Bland, fishy - mushy even.  Not good.  The rest of the meal was good but nothing really stood out.  On a positive note the prices seemed rediculously low for the setting and nabe.  $14-17 for entrees and $7-8 for apps and salads.    This place deserves a second chance and I'll update at that time."}
{"text":"I stumbled onto this place after it popped up on UrbanSpoon. It seems to have quite a cult following for the reviews I've read around the internet.   I went on a busy Friday night once and I was impressed with the atmosphere and general positive and classy disposition of the clientele. Service was nothing to write home about and the sauce on the steak was cold so it made the steak cold. For some reason I think this was an honest mistake and I'm willing to give them another chance based on all the other positive reviews I hear. If it improves I'll definitely up my rating.  The price is certainly right, not very expensive at all compared to other restaurants serving similar dishes."}
{"text":"I think I can in expecting to much wondering how come after living in this area for so long I have never seen or discovered this place. I know why now.   Although small from the front, it's actually quite large. It's neverending, extending to the back there where there is patio at the back too. But, the front section, is a bit crowded, the middle section as well (like they crammed in as many tables as they can) but the ceiling is low and the room is dim, downstairs seems better with more space. As well as the downstairs near the back where we sat.   This French bistro can't really compare to La Société or Le Select although prices are cheaper you do get what you paid for.   The menu consists of basic bistro fare like mussels, steak, calf's liver, lamb shank, beef short rib bourgogne, escargot frogs legs etc. All sounds really appealing but in reality was lack lustre.  We started with the Charcuterie plate $15 which had a bunch of pates and terrine but was disappointed when the server couldny describe which was which properly and in the end they call tasted the same.   I got the calf's liver $19 it was okay. Served with frites and green beans (as does steak and some other entrees). However, it was a small portion, and 1/4 of it was not cooked. I sent it back after I realized and finished the majority of the meal. They did not do any thing in consolation, a little disappointing.   My mom got the Sweetbread. It was served in a pastry and tasted like a pot pie. The sweetbread was almost tasteless in all of that. Hubby got the flatiron steak, but said it was too charred on top for Medium, and was too salty. Not amazing. My dad got this Pork thing, which he liked.   Our server was okay, but at a bare minimum. Was a little short and rude, but I don't think on purpose, that's just how she was. Just getting the job done.   Dessert, nothing really stood out and nothing spectacular.   I noticed as I was leaving, that the average age in here was probably 55+, folks who enjoy a simpler , more basic meal. On a Saturday night, it was a full house.   They had attracted me with their brunch menu - bennys at $10 ! I might give it a chance again for brunch, but my expectations are definately lower."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening (around 7pm) for a friend's birthday dinner.  The place was buzzing!  A nice charming restaurant with a cozy atmosphere.  A lot of the patrons were of an older demographic.  I had the duck confit (comes with frites) which was absolutely amazing. Almost as good as the duck confit in Paris! The brewed coffee was also delicious which is unique for \"restaurant coffee\". We had a large group of 10 and were served by multiple waitors,  all very pleasant and they worked together to bring us fast and efficient service. It was such a lovely evening and I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This review is a funeral dirge for one of my most favourite restaurants in the GTA. I've been there hundreds of times, over the past 2 decades, and I now have to call it a day.   The place has really gone downhill, with the food being below average, the fresh bread and butter replaced by supermarket stuff, the prices up, many of the \"lifer\" waiters gone, attitude from the new staff - the list really goes on and on.   I desperately wanted to ignore all of this, but it's rather impossible.   Rest in peace, Le Paradis bistro."}
{"text":"Went to Le Paradis with a group for dinner.  Service was very good, food not so much.  Had the octopus--dry and not tasty.  Then sweetbreads--they tasted elderly!   No flavour!  A friend had veal kidneys--much better, good flavour.  Ordered almond tart with berries for dessert--took one bite and gave up.  Tasted like bread pudding with jam.  Food very sub-par; they are phonimg it in.  This place used to be good, not any more.  Who cares what it costs when the food is not worth eating?"}
{"text":"I love this French restaurant - it makes me feel like I am in a little Parisian bistro.   Their menu changes daily, and they have a great selection of comfort food and affordable wines.  Another nice touch is their wait staff are very knowledgeable and offer great service - I detected a French accent in our server, but can't say for certain.   The restaurant is only open for lunch and dinner on weekdays, only dinners on weekends - so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service, and for French food in Toronto at prices between $14-20 an entree, this is almost a MUST. Try the dark chocolat truffle for dessert...it melts in your mouth and leaves a cooling sensation as it does so!"}
{"text":"Very average poor arrogant service mediocre food and I can only assume its popularity is based on the fact that it is well priced. Great if you don't care about how. You are treated or what you eat."}
{"text":"Le Paradis is probably more about being a nice place for upper crust neighbors and tennis partners to meet and enjoy a more reasonably priced meal during the week than it is trying to be the definition of French cuisine for Canada at 18 bucks a plate.  With that in mind, you might really like this place. The top sirloin I had was delicious. The cocktail and wine were both recommended by the waiter and were superb. I will agree with another reviewer on the frites. They were the low point in the meal. The grilled vegetables were near perfect, if not slightly oily.  The desserts enjoyed at my table were a delight. None were over six dollars. The lemon tart was a tangy treat.  If you go to Le Paradis with the goal of writing a Yelp review, you may find the staff a bit harried at times and the food speaking less than fluent French. However, if you want a relaxing evening out at a place with good food, drinks, and conversation you may see why this place has the feel of a neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"La nourriture et la service sont merveilleuses. J'ai commandé les oeufs Bénédicte qui étaient bons. Je donnerais un 5 s'il n'était pas pour le menu mouillé que j'ai trouvé, mais l'atmosphère était charmante."}
{"text":"2 good friends,a bottle of good Corbieres and bistro food.Parfait?  The 'special' was a pork chop with melted cheese . Yum good German food?Greasy consistently terrible frites. Seafood stew a klutzy bouillabaisse ( this ain't L'Express)God awful looking pates.Fresh from the tank trout.Kidneys ,not overcooked   this time ,with port sauce the latter thankfully replaced  on request by a red wine mustard sauce(not a la moutarde)Out of season asparagus fresh as the air on a 767 flight from Lima.  icecreams served with canned ersatz foam.Warily friendly staff.  Ou est la France?Not in Toronto. C'est triste."}
{"text":"As a foody, I have to say I love Toronto. I love the fact that when i am craving for an international cuisine, I can almost find everything here.   For this review, I am featuring a French restaurant that I learned through word of mouth from other people who also love doing what I love doing, eating.   I highly reccomend their Auvergnate ($7) salad to start. It's a very simple salad made up of Fresh Arugula, Belgian endives, walnut, apples and blue cheese and drizzled with olive oil. A great start that was followed by a juicy piece of peppered Flatiron steak with pepercorn sauce (Pave de Boeuf au Poivre) for a bargain $17. I honestly would have paid $35 for this steak.  Both the salad and the steak went really well with the bottle of Malbec ($23 - what a deal!!) which we ordered. I wanted to order dessert after but I felt stuffed after gobbling up a fair share of  their complimentary yummy french bread.   Service was professional. Ambience was a bit loud at one point of the evening during the rush. Rest assured, it will not feel like a sports bar.   I have to thank this restaurant for making me fall in love with French food and culture.   I also have to thank my friend Lito and Bruce for introducing me to this restaurant that's nicely nestled in Avenue and Davenport. You may have to look a little bit to find this place but it is worth the effort.  Happy Eating!!  Niko"}
{"text":"Just ok - but this might be biased as French food is not really my thing.  I found the ambiance nice enough and the dessert was the highlight of the meal.  Service is definitely something that can be improved - I saw some of the waiters give quite a bit of attitude to customers.  Anyways, I guess this is the \"french experience\" after all. :)"}
{"text":"Tasty and delicious FRENCH cuisine. I have been here numerous times with my family and we always have the best time. The service is some of the fastest and best in the city. The servers know the menu inside out and always help finding suggestions. Can't go wrong with trying the mussels and frites and also the steak frites. By the way, the food is always super fresh and EXTREMELY WELL PRICED!"}
{"text":"Cozy, comfortable atmosphere with friendly staff.  We sat in the lower level near the back near the door, so it was a bit chilly.  The menu apparently, changes daily, but it seems that several of the menu items stay on the menu for awhile.  As appetizers, we ordered the I ordered the sweetbreads in puff pastry, and quail. The sweetbreads were delicious with the flaky puff pastry. The quail was meh. It had a lot of cumin flavour, a bit too strong I think.  For the entree, I ordered the boeuf bourguignon. The sauce was flavourful, with buttery mashed potatoes and chunks of beef that melted in my mouth. I soaked up the rest of the sauce with their complimentary bread.  Pricing was adequate. It came to approximately $50 per person including drinks, taxes and tip."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar, steak frite is my weakness, speak french. Always worth a visit when in To."}
{"text":"This place is over-rated. Its true it has a nice atmosphere. Kind of a cozy place and has the \"feel\" of a french bistro. But its loud in there. and the food isn't spectacular.  One time I went there and ordered the special for the night. It was monk fish served on a bed of ratatouille. The fish was terrible. So dry you could choke on it. In fact everything felt like it had the life sucked out of it. Like it had been sitting around for a while. In retrospect, I should've taken Anthony Bourdain's advice and avoided the \"fish special\".  Anyway, I have had other things on the menu and they are nothing special at best. Unfortunately, I can't say i've had any really incredible french food in Toronto like i've had in other places (most notably France and if you can believe it - Mexico - man they cook their asses off over there..). So far, Auberge Du Pommier is the best I've had in this city. Go there instead."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great prices and prompt service.  La Paradis is one of the best value in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is a good, old school French style bistro in an attractive part of town.  We stuck with bistro classics - steak frites, creme brulee, etc and were pleased with what we got. Prices are reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Of late, there has been a strain of French Bistros opening up in Toronto but Le Paradis most definitely got here first.  I usually have something witty to say in my reviews but for some reason, when it comes to this particular restaurant I don't.  Perhaps I am coming up flat in the comedy department because this restaurant has nothing funny about it.  Not that it takes itself too seriously, but it is what it is; a French restaurant.   Everything from the charming but casual, European décor, to the fresh baguette at every table, to the daily changing menu filled with Fruits De Mer and Pomme Frites reflects its staunch French sensibility.  The restaurant is busy, comfortable, and reasonable for Rosedale.  But, come for the food not the fun."}
{"text":"Great food, service is a little slow but friendly"}
{"text":"My companions enjoyed a delicious dinner here. The menu is classic French bistro and whatever it lacks in originality it makes up with tasty dishes and affordable prices (especially given the location).  The main courses include a four or five fish options as well as a full range of meat (pork, rabbit, veal, liver, etc.) and poultry. The dishes range from pure French to Moroccan in influence, although when we asked about the tagine, we were told it wasn't actually served in a tagine dish because \"this is a *FRENCH* restaurant\".  Portions are generous -- my companions and I each ordered a starter and main and we were all stuffed by the end. In hindsight, I would have happily shared a starter and saved some room for dessert. (The fresh bread and butter that arrives at the start doesn't help.) There's also a \"table d'hôte\" menu with 3 courses for $20. Otherwise, if you order à la carte, mains are all between $10 and $20 and sides less than $10, so for a full meal with wine, you're looking at about $40 per person.  The wine list has many affordable options, either by the bottle ($30-60) or by the glass or half-litre.   I had the pâté to start, which was a huge portion served with bread, mustard and little \"cornichons\". The flavour was excellent. For my main, I had the half-chicken which was served with delicate julienned vegetables, cooked to perfection, and a generous serving of the excellent frites. The chicken was comfort food, to be sure, but very tasty. My companions all enjoyed their salads, and mains -- a grilled salmon, a Moroccan tagine, and the flatiron steak.  All in all I wouldn't hesitate to return. My only complaint was that our waitress was quite flippant regarding my companion's food allergies, and refused to permit any changes or even check with the kitchen. The restaurant was packed at the time, so it's understandable that changes would be difficult, but the attitude was unnecessary."}
{"text":"Best value meal in the city. Such great quality for $13-14 mains. I Have eaten here half a dozen times and never disappointed. It's always busy so there might be a wait."}
{"text":"Such a great find!  The food there was fantastic - very french with a little bit of a flare.  I've lived in France in the past, and this place definitely compares with the typical French Bistro in Paris.  Service is fast and friendly.  Bread is fresh and food is yummy.  I've only been there for lunch, but the croque madam and monsieur are awesome and worth going back for. Parking is a bit tricky as I could only find street parking around there, but it's worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Le Paradis is one of my favourite go-to spots for French food. I have been frequenting this little neighbourhood gem for many, many years, and I have never once been disappointed with the food or service.  Restaurant is always busy, so I would recommend making a reservation in advance; you can usually make one the day of. The food is always consistent - my significant other and I usually tend to order the same items on each visit. I would highly recommend the Raclette as a starter: warm delicious melted raclette cheese tops seasonal vegetables. The Bavette and Pave de Boeuf are succulently prepared steaks, accompanied with frites and seasonal veg - all perfection.   The service is always consistent and professional, the wines are delicious and reasonably priced, and the food is superb. Le Paradis is also an interesting people watching spot as it is always busy, and you will find different, interesting mixes of people.  Back and front patios in the summertime are quaint and charming, as is the bistro-esque seating area on the inside. Neighbourhood locals tend to frequent the bar area to have a glass of wine or come for a nice dinner and some engaging conversation with the staff.   We have taken many out-of-town guests and clients to this venue and no one has ever been disappointed with the food, service and price. I would definitely put this on your list of little hidden gems to check out in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night on a last-minute date whim. We didn't make reservations and the place was packed, but we managed to snag a table on the back patio.  3 star food but everything else is 4+ star worthy.  Lots of classic French bistro dishes. The prices are extremely reasonable. Entrees around $14-$17, appetizers for $5-$7 and desserts for only $5. Even the wine was cheap - $15 for a 1/2 liter of house red or white.  The menu changes daily but they had a varied selection with 4-5 fish dishes, plus plenty of beef, chicken and lamb.  Very excellent and attentive service.  The interior is quite large and made up of several oddly shaped rooms; I imagine it was some kind of manor house turned into a restaurant. There's a small patio at the front but a way better patio at the back.   Lots of OLD patrons eating here. I'm talking 65+.   We tried a fish terrine and the Auvergnate salad with blue cheese, walnuts and apples to start. Both were just OK. The mains were much nicer, I had lamb shank (yum!) served Moroccan style with chickpeas, etc. My date had some kind of beef dish which was really good too.  The creme caramel was HUGE. Double size of what I've had in other restaurants. I only tried a bite but it was delicious."}
{"text":"Le Paradis is my favourite brasserie in Toronto! The atmosphere is reminiscent of a typical corner restaurant in Paris, and the desire for such nostalgia is seen in many of the patrons who opt for items such as steak frites or boeuf bourguigonne!  I have not ever really had a bad meal at Paradis, but there are a few items that stand out more than others. The seafood special which often includes branzino is usually on point as are the moules mariniere (PEI muscles in white wine) and steak frites. Though not the most popular item, the veal liver is also prepared quite well at Paradis. As a bonus, the wine list is quite affordable with most bottles ranging between $20-40.   This is a spot where I would not shy away from dessert and coffee! The creme caramel is quite fantastic and high in demand! Balthazar is also a friend to your sweet tooth and will complement the European flavoured coffee that is served with it!   Overall, Paradis is an excellent venue to kick back and enjoy some classic French cuisine with friends or family."}
{"text":"A pretty good restaurat with real French food and not fusion food, in a setting quite looking like French troquets and bistrot. I will go back and have evrything on the menu!!  (not 5 because it can always be better, with finer things here and there, especially when it is French cooking!)"}
{"text":"This neighbourhood restaurant is always reliable.  The food is consistently good, the servers are friendly and casual - without sacrificing professionalism or efficiently, and the atmosphere is always great.  You can show up in jeans or a suit, and you'll fit right in."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite date night spots!  The food is always excellent and the price is right!!   Delicious French food and great wines at a reasonable price.  Have been 10+ times and plan to continue to visit."}
{"text":"Le Paradis Brasserie has such nice patios, both front and back! I would have really enjoy my lunch if I able to get a table there... but unfortunately if it was raining, I got one of tables inside the stuffy dining room.   Lunch Specials always the way to go!! They have reasonable daily lunch specials written on the chalkboard or in the paper menu that has open sandwiches with choice of a cold or hot soup and choice of salad or frites for $10.   Decisions! Decisions! Which sandwich should I have?? How about the soup?? oh should I be healthy and go for salad but frites supposed to be really good here!!   Grilled Salmon Sandwich with Cold Cucumber Soup and Spring Salad  - Chilled Cucumber Soup for sure is the highlight of my lunch. Zesty, refreshing and seasoned really well... spoon licking delicious!  - The sandwich is A-OK... seasoned with a dash of herb vinaigrette  - Salad is a disappointment, just a boring boring salad that is not even fresh! Go for the frites!!   Services was excellent!! I feel welcome and comfortable dining here as a single diner... nothing to complain when my waiter kept coming around checking on me and feed me more baguette!!"}
{"text":"Solid French food for a good price. This is my regular go-to place to create a cozy, comfortable, yet memorable impression with people. The staff are warm and lovely. They have a good wine list and will make you whatever drink you want, which is exactly what I need sometimes.   Their brunch, lunch, and dinner menus tend to stick to what they do well, and I'm not complaining one bit.  This is a little neighborhood gem. My friend works in Yorkville and didn't know about the place until I suggested it, he said he'll visit more often after our meal there."}
{"text":"Service was good. The food, in general, at our table was good. However, neither my dinner dish or anyone around me was raving about what they had. In summary, our experience was good but nothing worth going out of our way for."}
