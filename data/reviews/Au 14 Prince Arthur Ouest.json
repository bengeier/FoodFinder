{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for years! Great mom and pop Vietnamese restaurant! Prices are super cheap! Service is great! Food is yummy and comes out quickly! Anytime I'm in the neighbourhood I always pass by for a soup! Definitely a great place for lunch and a quick dinner!"}
{"text":"There were only four reviews and all of them were 5 star reviews. Unfortunately, the taste and service of the restaurant were absolutely not a five star. In particular, the taste of the noodle soup is not very good. Not worth. I regret my decisions to visit this place."}
{"text":"Really good, lovely food, it is definitely making Vietnamese food in Montreal great again! One of the better Vietnamese restaurants in Montreal with a great atmosphere, the service was very friendly and welcoming. The value of the food is a 5 out of 5. Since I live very close to this restaurant, would definitely be coming back soon. The quality of food is fantastic, one of the best in town for the price. If y'all been following me with my adventures in trying to find the best Vietnamese food in Montreal, I recommend this one. I'm one of the only qualified Vietnamese cuisine reviewer in town as well as in the world.  This one is absolutely wonderful. Good price! Good Food! I'm not joking!"}
{"text":"It's the best Asian style food with reasonable prices I've ever had in Montreal. Friendly service and cozy environment served with delicious and healthy food. Papaya salad was quite yummy. Fortune cookies were interesting."}
{"text":"We had the best meal at this restaurant last night.  For starters we had the dried beef and the Imperial Rolls which were excellent.  Then we had Cantonese noodles with chicken beef and vegetables.   The taste was divine!  We also had a side portion of rice which was also very good.  We asked for some caramel chicken sauce on the side to put on our main dish.  Delicious!  We ordered a few Sapporo beers to wash it all down with.  We were very pleased with the whole experience.  We've been coming here for 24 years and it's always great."}
{"text":"Looks awful, tastes awful, small quantities.  I've been taking out from there as a last resort sometimes out of convenience since it was right next to my place but it's the last time and I will never return.   The food is Viet which is very simple cuisine from the gecko (Not like some other asian cuisines which require more spices and preparation) but this is Not what Vietnamese cuisine looks or tastes like.   I have tried many different things on the menu and here is a list of reasons not to go there:  -small portions : the fried chicken plate is basically a galette of fried batter put on top of 3 leaves of salad next to a tea spoon of rice     -the \"dumplings\" have no filling inside (XXXsmall piece of shrimp like if you take a shrimp and cut it in 6 and then put one piece and cover it with dough)  -they charge you extra for utensils  -they will charge extra for sauce if you order a spring roll if you mind to ask but if you don't ask them they wont even bother putting any sauce. (Like foreal??)   -the soup tastes and looks like vegetables in boiled water  -the place is ALWAYS empty  -the place stinks   -my great grand mother has a better taste for interior design   -the staff is rude and make you feel unwelcome (looks like your interrupting some meeting every time you walk in since they are always sitting at the table next to the cash)   After trying all the menu, I have to admit that there was nothing good there and plus the place is a shit whole"}
