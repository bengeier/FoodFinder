{"text":"Used to like this place, but it's really gone downhill over the years. Forget trying to order take out--they either forget you called, or something because they never have the order ready! They started fish friday's, and ever since their food (eggs especially) have this gross fishy after-taste. It's a shame, because mom and pop sit downs like this are hard to find--and it used to be one of the best ones.  I don't recommend eating here, and honestly don't know how they always have so much business. Maybe it's the novelty, or people don't mind the quality of food as long as it's cheap enough."}
{"text":"Very good food. Meat off the grill has great flavor and service was very good. Old interior so watch out for the booth seats. Would very much go back. Price is right."}
{"text":"Just introduced to this great restaurant!  Awesome food, great pricing and friendly staff! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is one of those small, neighborhood places that is easy to pass up - I oughta know having done just that.  But tonight we stopped in and had dinner.  It was great!  We ordered the fish which (for $7.99) is a great value and ALL YOU CAN EAT!  This entree includes three sides.  Although the salad was a little watery, the soup was pretty good and the green beans - not bad.  The place looks small from the outside but inside it's huge. Lots of room, great lighting, pleasant music and the staff was awesome.  From our hostess to our waiter (Ruben) everything was smooth and easy.  We can't wait to go back for breakfast!    If you believe in supporting local businesses while trying to save a buck, try the Royal Cafe.  I think we've got a winner here!"}
{"text":"Great cafe. Walk in very welcoming staff. Large room but nice overhangs over each section makes it look cosy. Breakfast this am was a wonderful bacon and sausage skillet. Lots of meat. Lots of flavor and fresh eggs. Fresh hot coffee on table carafes waiting for you. Very reasonable prices. Worth a visit will try their lunch next time   My daughter had really good cherry pancakes."}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast here recently. It was our first visit but we'll be back. The food is basic but delicious. I had a breakfast special that included eggs, sausage and pancakes, all of which we're tasty. My husband ordered the breakfast burrito which was ample and filled with bacon, ham, onions and tomato. All that food and a pot of coffee cost only $12. I especially like that they leave your own pot of coffee at the table. The interior is dated but the table, dishes and utensils are clean and the service is friendly. The clientele is also dated so be prepared for some looks if you're nifty but under fifty."}
{"text":"absolutely disquisting!!!!!!!  we went with my husbands parents for breakfast, and his dad ordered a breakfast burrito, halfway thru it he found HALF A ROACH!!!! we called the manager over and showed the manager, he just looked at it and said \"oh it happens...\" we left right away and took a pic of the roach in the food, sent it to the health department, and they told us they had many reports against them."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going there for at least 8 years now. We are from back east and when we found this place it was great, service was great, food great, it was our Sunday brunch place.   They recently opened up a new restaurant on Bell and ever since then this place has been totally neglected. Service has declined, cleanliness declined,  food has lacked and the owner could care less about keeping his clientele.  Don't even bother complaining he is the definition of apathy. It's almost as if he wants the business to fail.   So sad! Fortunately my husband and I have found another diner that is what royal cafe used to be. :-)  I wouldn't be surprised if they tank or get closed down soon."}
{"text":"we have been going there 4 years-it has really gone down hill bad the woman behind the counter are NOT friendly the portions have shrunk in size the service is VERYslow-the lady at the register just ignores you when the waitress does not come by-she stares at you like you have 2 heads-I thought we were doing them a favor by spending money there. if we are they sure don't act like it, there used to be a great staff there a few years ago but not so anymore. the food is ok but not as good as a few years ago and the portions are very small-btw the French fries are awful"}
{"text":"This humble-in-decor restaurant is one of our favorites for reliably good food, friendly staff, and an inexpensive outing.  It's family-owned, and pride-of-ownership comes through... especially in the home-made desserts they showcase near the front door.  Their soups are also home-made, and Sunday's Chicken Rice soup is so good we've frequently taken home extra containers for the next day and to freeze for when we desperately need a momma-love-comfort-food fix.  Their menu is full of familiar standards, but their daily dinner specials show a talent for individuality and a flair for adventure.  I love their Chicken Mensajero (broiled chicken breast with freshly steamed onions, mushrooms, and green peppers)... the cooks in the kitchen understand flavors and how to bring out the best in food combining.  Having worked as a waitress, I was also impressed by an overheard conversation as I passed by one of the dining booths.  One of the owners (the wife of the family), and the primary baker (the mother-in-law), and one of the waitresses were in discussion.  The owner asked the waitress, \"So how do you think it would work better for the wait staff...?\"  No wonder all the employees like working here - they're treated like people, and not machines!  And their happiness rolls downhill into treating customers as welcome members to the table."}
{"text":"If you're in Sun City and are looking for a place to eat that's local, this is the place. I found this place by accident bc I didn't want to eat breakfast at Denny's.  The menu is pretty straightforward, and the prices are very cheap. The decor is definitely dated, but that's probably how the owners keep the cost of food down.  Just bc it's cheap doesn't mean it's not good! The food was pretty good. My friend asked for soft scrambled eggs, and was delighted to get them. The bacon was crisp, and not greasy. We both got the biscuits and gravy, which was definitely filling. In fact, I couldn't finish mine. If I'm in the neighborhood, I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tried their Fish Fry on 5/26/17. I was there with 4 other friends. Three of us had the all you can eat fish fry, 2 had the all you can eat shrimp dinner. I had the shrimp which was really good. Each piece was hot like it just came out of the fryer. The fish was hit and miss. One piece I tried was hot and tender, and others were tough like it was over cooked. The tarter sauce was amazing, the best I've had at any area restaurant.  Couple other complaints of that evening, it was hot in the restaurant, I don't like sweating while I eat my meal, but that's what I did along with the others in my party. Then when paying after the meal, the elderly woman as the cashier, never asked if we liked the meal and how anything was. Never even thanked us for eating at their establishment! I'll have to re-think about going back."}
{"text":"The young waiter by the name of Reuben with the short faded hair.Was disrespectful because he ask my friend Mother,a kind woman if she was interested in buying drugs AKA weed. I believe this guy needs to be investigated. I wanted to see for myself and sure enough he even ask me if I wanted to buy chronic. The food is wonderful but incident shouldn't happen. We notified the owner on 05/26/17. He said he will take care of it. I'm notifying yelp about it."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous.  The Food, the service and the price were all fabulous.   The waitress was the best.   Funny and smart along with the other staff just fab.   I am a picky eater and I loved every bite of eggs and potatoes and the peach sweet.  Go  You will be very happy you did."}
{"text":"Old school diner/coffee shop.  Food was very good.  Place needed a remodeling 20 years ago.....but if that doesnt bother you. ...... You will be happy.  Very elderly clientele."}
{"text":"When your in the area , looking for cheep comfort food , this is the place, the breakfasts here are fantastic, the other entrees looked like large portions, and a nice presentation.  My companion ordered the french toast, and he really enjoyed it. Kinda of a dive, the booths are old , the service isn't the greatest,  but...ah......but to have Mom's cooking."}
{"text":"The best part of the food is the toast. EVERYTHING was soaked in oil. I would not come back The waitress was as sweet as pie. She was the best part of meal"}
{"text":"Got our day started with an excellent breakfast at Royal Cafe. Our server Sophia was very attentive from the time we enter until we left. Our food was delicious and fresh. Important for me, the toast was warm and soft with real butter. Portion sizes were large, to the point that I left food on my plate. We will be back. Sincerely, Art & Karen Huseonica, Sun City."}
{"text":"The place really needs an update.  I kept hoping the guy from Restaurant Impossible would come in with his sledge hammer and go to work.   Been there for the Friday night fish fry a few times.  Always the same two soups; clam chowder (I didn't like it at all) and vegetable soup.  Choice of vegetables is always the green beans, which are also in the salty vegetable soup.  You will be thirsty later in the evening.  They serve Cod for the fish fry (usually 3 small pieces) and they will always bring more.  No problem with the portions.  However, during my last visit, my wife was served with one of the portions of fish completely frozen and uncooked, although it had the batter on it.  You couldn't even cut it.  They replaced immediately when brought to their attention, but you have to wonder why or how it managed to leave the kitchen in the first place.  They definitely cater to the older crowd.  Pricing is reasonable for this venue."}
{"text":"The Royal Cafe has good food at great prices. I have been here for dinner and breakfast and have not been disappointed either time."}
{"text":"I love this place, it gives you good food for an amazingly low price. If you like a comfy mom and pop shop this is the one and I have never had bad service.  The fries are so good the liver and onions are delicious the eggs and steaks are so good!! Salads great!! The veggie soup is so good!! I will continue to come to this place, I am glad to have run into it so many years ago!  Whenever I am in the vicinity I pop in."}
{"text":"lmao.    I believe the term is greasy spoon. But it was surprising because they had a load of business.   There's no way I'm doing a review on this place. Or anything negative. They seriously had a ton of business so maybe they place just want for me.   I mean the Patty melt was good but nothing special. So I dunno."}
{"text":"This Place IS so cheap .. For señor but Their food IS incredible And the server so polite .. Even Its DAR from where I Live I Go here  .... I highlight recommend this Place ESP breakfast"}
{"text":"Carol was a sweet waitress she was on top of all her tables. The food was good except the bacon was way to crispy for my liking. :) but I WOULD deffinatly come back!!!! I want to try a open faced sandwich.  Thanks Carol again for being GREAT!!! ;)"}
{"text":"Was my first time to try this place..... Was waiting for over 15 minutes until ANYONE will acknowledge you there.... So got up and walked to the front to get menu ... Then I asked casher ..... Can someone take order? Guess what? I just left!!!!! Obviously young people were not welcomed there! Not trying again !!!!!!"}
{"text":"My parents live in Sun City and love this place, they have generous portions and are well balanced for seniors, the breakfasts are good and they offer crepes.  Very much a diner."}
{"text":"Went here recently for dinner I had a hot turkey open faced sandwich. While eating this turkey sandwich I noticed a black speck on the plate under a piece of turkey .Upon closer inspection I found that it had legs. I do not blame the waitress for serving it to me  because it was hidden under the turkey but I do blame the cook for putting it on my plate and the owner for not cleaning up this place the bathrooms are not really clean and I was told that the men's bathroom  The stall divider has rust all over it. You can generally tell the quality of a restaurant by the cleanliness of their bathrooms this place really tells it all . I WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS PLACE EVER."}
{"text":"The Mr & I used to frequent this place quite often.  However, after numerous complaints about the cart of dirty dishes parked next to our booth went unheard, we'd finally had it.  Who wants to see other people's dirty dishes while you're eating.  Plus, the food was just ok (not extraordinary), the price relatively cheap, the service a bit slow and the mgmt unfriendly.  I'll never go back!"}
{"text":"One of the oldest and most established eateries in Sun City.  The ambience is early truckstop, but the food has always been good and the service OK.  We don't go here often in the winter while the snowbirds are here because we typically would go Friday night or Sunday morning and there is usually a huge crowd (anywhere from 30-45 minute wait.  Even in the summer it is crowded.  The service is usually good but you can have  a 5-10 minute wait just in line to pay at the register."}
{"text":"We are from a different side of town(San tan valley) and thought we would take a chance with trying sometime different. Best decision we've made this morning! The moment we walked through the door we were greeted by the cutest little lady hostess. Immediately she seated us at a table and offered us fresh hot coffee. Within seconds our server Ruben approached the table notifying us of the daily/weekly specials. We took advantage of this low-cost quality food special. To our surprise, our hot, fresh, delicious food arrived within 2-3 minutes after placing the order. Being a restaurant manager myself I would definitely have to say the customer service provided at this establishment is Beyond exceptional. Ruben could not have been more accommodating. He sent us on our way with a to go coffee as a bonus. This is a perfect cozy place to dine inexpensively. We will definitely be returning in the near future as well as sharing this information with our friends and family local to the area."}
{"text":"Went for sauerbraten special.  Food was OK.  Service spotty.  Atmosphere terrible.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I just had breakfast here went to pay my bill and was under 8 dollars 3 eggs 2 sausage 2 pieces of toast and coffee, food was on my table in less than 5 minutes. I don't Yelp much but this place is absolutely worth  a 6 star review. I'm coming back tomorrow, and every time I have a job in sun City this is my spot"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the price was very reasonable.  The waitress was very attentive and kept asking what she could do for us.  We never had to ask for a refill on pop or water.  The food arrived hot and quick.  The decor is nothing to write home about, but if all you want is good food at a great price, then this is the place."}
{"text":"What a tasty surprise in the middle of Sun City.  I was visiting friends there for a week, and they insisted we go. Friendly and efficient staff served up a wide variety of staples like juicy Angus burgers, spaghetti, steaks, as well as breakfast stuffs. I really liked the broasted chicken which was very flavorful and moist. I also loved their strawberry shortcake and homemade pies.    The prices are very fair, and they have a few specials too. We went back 3 times in a week. I highly recommend it.  PS. I just noted that yelp lists it as a Chinese Restaurant. It is definitely not Chinese but American."}
{"text":"\"Royal\"......no way.   Their ad in the Independent advertises all you can eat cod fish fry.   We had the cod fish fry and the portion was plenty,  but we were never given the option of getting more by the awful waiter we had.  The Board of Health should look into the place for sure."}
{"text":"Breakfast is pretty good, and highly affordable.  It's the war going on between the waitresses that really gets you.  They won't help each other, not one bit.  The one with the coffee pot will walk right past those who aren't in her \"station.\"  Avoiding eye contact in amazing fashion so you can't even flag 'em down.  It's clear the \"blonde bomber\" and the \"chubby hispanic\" originally met at Panmunjom.  A refill on water?  Fuggedaboutit!   They won't tell the other when a new customer sits in the other's station.  It's all out war.  Time to fire them all and start over IMHO.  I tried calling to talk to the owner, Tom about the battle going on out front.  From what I overheard I'm pretty sure the waitress just set the phone down and waited a while to tell me he wasn't there."}
{"text":"Tl; dr: quick service, delicious food. No complaints at all.   Full review: There are a few things I look for in diners: speed of service, and quality. This may sound obvious, with most of them serving the same items, but not all cafes/diners are equal.   Now, I'm a satellite technician and I work all over the west valley. Whenever I have a lunch break, I usually stop at whatever is close. Today it happened to be royal cafe in sun city.   While the area is predominantly senior citizens, I love breakfast more than any other meal. So I sat by myself and ordered my food (a #4 combo because I'm a sucker for eggs, pancakes, and bacon AKA the classics).  The service was quick. I ordered, had my food, and ate it within 12 minutes.  Also, the waitress was nice and she didn't waste my time. She brought the check with the food so I didn't have to wait.  As for the food, it was all delicious. Fluffy pancakes, perfectly scrambled eggs, and crispy but not burned bacon.   I tried this place in a whim and wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"LITERALLY MORTIFIED.. I have been going here for years to eat with different groups of people. We always enjoyed Sally the waitress.. We go here at least once every 2 weeks for breakfast the food is always great. This morning I went in to take a friend to breakfast.  We ordered our coffee started chit chatting ordered our food kept chit chatting till our much anticipated food arrived. The waitress set the plates down and a baby COCKROACH crawled from one of the plates. I managed to place a glass of water on top of it and showed the waitress. We immediately got up and walked out. I'm so saddened because I used to frequent here with my Grandmother who has now passed, I came here always for the great food Sally and memories. I don't know where they are going wrong but in the last year it seems this place is going down hill. From the decor to now this cockroach incident. You know that there are more because it was a baby. Ugh sooooooo disappointing."}
{"text":"The place is....uh...a dump in a crap looking area, but the prime rib dinner for $11+ is a spectacular dinner, well cooked, tasty and a huge piece of meat!  Good deal! I've eaten here a few times with my neighbors, never been disappointed in the food or the service...just this ain't duh Ritz location or buildingwise.   My friend eats breakfast here alot with her volunteer group.  I think they have some $2.50 eggs, toast, coffee, hash brown deal then.  She says it's good, and being the superior cook she is I believe her. For a good, cheap dinner well done and good service, too...try Royal Cafe. They have TONS of regulars so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"I am NOT a Senior Citizen yet and I love this place.  NICE staff, generous portions, they do NOT gouge you with drink prices and the food is quite good.  Other places around could learn a lot from their friendly staff.  I have had everything from breakfast to Liver & Onions (which is GREAT here).  They do not break your wallet on ANY dish.  Wish all the other places were as fair as they are with menu prices.  Many thanks!"}
{"text":"Solid diner with rock bottom prices. Kitschy atmosphere, elderly clientele. They know now to fry. The skillet dish is very good.  Stick with the diner classics and breakfast.  Old school menu choices like the Diet Plate. Delightfully authentic with zero pretension of being anything other than a solid diner."}
{"text":"No stars it's that bad over an hour wait for our food and it was cold and no reason no apology for it didn't even offer to reduce the check never never ever go again food suck staff suck owner sucked  this star doesn't count only way I could post !!"}
{"text":"For a Mom and Pop restaurant- it is pretty good. My parents love their Fridays fish fry. The fish is very crispy. I love their speghetti and meatballs and garlic Toast. Price is not bad. They have to work on thier veggie soup. But if you are not picky - the soup is fair.   It hit and miss on the service. Sometime you get great service and sometime you get not so great service."}
{"text":"Most definitely one of the nastiest restaurants that I have ever entered. Will NOT go back.  The food was decent - certainly nothing to rave about, but you have to work pretty hard to screw up bacon and eggs.  The restrooms were filthy. Had I seen them before ordering, I would have gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely horrible! The service was terrible the food was bad in the restrooms were filthy as was the dining room I would never go back"}
{"text":"While the service was okay, the food left much to be desired. Carl ordered the fish fry with three sides, slaw, cottage cheese and green beans. He said the fish, slaw and cottage cheese were okay, but the green beans were tough and woody. I ordered the Greek salad. They were out of Greek dressing so I chose Italian which had a sweet flavor, not compatible with the salad. When the salad was served, I went right for one of the kalamata olives which I dearly love. To my surprise, it tasted like it has been soaked in kerosene or some sort of chemical. The waitress asked how the food was and I told her about the olives. When I told her of the awful taste, she said that kalamata olives have a different taste. I told her I knew that because I eat them several times a week. She said she would bring me some regular olives and brought a dish of sliced black olives which I ate on the salad---just not the same. The ambience is quite shabby. I had anticipated a nice dinner since several friends told me how good the was as well as being very affordable. I do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, service is good! Very reasonable prices. The owners need to spend some money on decorating. Chicken fried steak was the most tender I've ever had, eggs cooked perfectly. With home fries and toast for $8.99."}
{"text":"The food was okay until a cockroach ran across our table. We immediately got up to leave.  Went to pay for our check and owners didn't even offer a discount for our dinner. My husband killed cockroach on the table and they saw it."}
{"text":"As snow birds we have eaten at the Royal many times over the last several years, but before I knew about yelping.  So, taking everything into consideration I can honestly say this is a great place for breakfast which is what we usually come for.  They do a bustling business and on Sundays you have to get there early or you will hit the 'after church' crowd and then you have a bit of a wait.  The staff is friendly and helpful and if it's not busy they are fine with letting you sip your coffee and finish the crossword puzzle.    We've eaten dinner there a few times too.  I've tried the chicken breast and fish of some sort and was pleased.  The baked potatoes are good, the salads are fresh and their dressings are great.  The times we have had dinner they have usually served fresh green beans as the veggie.  I have not tried their home made desserts but they look delicious.    So, this place is really a very high three in my yelpimation."}
{"text":"Very low key atmosphere, friendly staff. Asked to modify an omelette and that was not a problem.  Not sure if it a true Mom/Pop place but the staff acts like it   Only suggestion would be to change the coffee brand - a little weak. The portions and price make up for that though - by far."}
{"text":"Cute little place with super nice staff. Choice of seating, great prices and nice diner atmosphere."}
{"text":"Out of date senior diner. We had breakfast a couple of years ago, and it tasted okay, but nothing special. We decided to try them again, but for dinner on a Thursday night around 6:30pm.  We won't be back.  I ordered the special of Salisbury steak, Mom ordered the veal cutlet, and Dad the chopped steak. We all got the soup as one \"side\". We all had the chicken w/dumplings and it was good. It had us looking forward to the main course, and....what a let down. The Salisbury steak was barely warm, the mashed potatoes cold, with lukewarm gravy. I had the waitress take it back and saw that she microwaved it, and it still came back only slightly warmer than when she took it. Mom said the breaded veal had a sausage like flavor so the waitress did offer something else, and brought her the chopped steak instead. That did arrive hot, but after the rest of us were done eating. We also had to ask three times for the dinner rolls that the menu says you get w/meal. After finally getting them (actually 2 and a half rolls), I heard the waitress tell the party at the next table that she just gave out the last rolls, and would they like a slice of bread instead. Each meal was just 7.99, so I guess that's what keeps the senior coming back, either that or they are the only cafe in the area, maybe a bit of both. Dad said his was okay, but also not hot."}
{"text":"More like a 2.5 but I am going to be gracious.  Neighbor wanted the Friday night fish fry, so I am back.  Food a 3 Service a weird, make your order and then bill is presented.  A 2 in my book.  Green beans were fresh and not over cooked.  All you can eat fish or shrimp...not the best but affordable...you want more?  They bring it.  Atmosphere is older and more grungy.  Could use a spring cleaning to get dirt and dust in order.  Bathroom clean and well prepared ... a 3.  Minus points for being non eco friendly.  Multiple plastic cups for sauces and salad dressings.  Add a baked potato and then there are 5 on the table.  USE small bowls please...very disturbing to me.  How many covers a night? A week?  A month?  Bad form and bad for the environment.   Don't know what it is here but they don't respect space.  They crowd you and use the back of the booth to write other people's checks.  Just rude I think.  Positive note.  Manager Brian friendly and engaging."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, and had a booth with very nice seats. Ordered the fried chicken, which was very good. I didn't care for the potatoes and white gravy, and really didn't like the soggy and overcooked-to-mush green beans. My husband ordered the Gyro omelette and a short stack of cakes. He loved his breakfast, which came with potatoes and toast. I will come back again to try to liver and onions; next time I'll order a baked potato and see how good that is."}
{"text":"The absolute best omelette I've ever had...it was cooked perfect, had plenty of goodies inside, big portion also, hash browns were also good, and toast is toast.....I go here for my omelette fix.... it really is awesome"}
{"text":"We're done! We used to enjoy their breakfasts. Sadly, no more. Twice in one week. One weekend day and one weekday, both with the same result. Cold meals. cold toast, eggs, potatoes, bacon. No more. Not worth it at any cost."}
{"text":"convenient location - often moved without notice or found ceilings falling or the restaurant flooded.  I quit going here because I don't feel they really value their customers."}
