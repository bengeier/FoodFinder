{"text":"Awesome experience, we got there by random choice, but were greatly surprised by the food taste and friendly staff! I took the smoked  brisket which was delicious! I'll get back there and bring all my friends!! Thank you guys !!"}
{"text":"The curd cheese on the poutine was okay, but the pulled pork on top was delicious. I enjoy the live music! The guy who was singing jazz on Sunday Night Oct 11th was really amazing."}
{"text":"Beyond bad. Keep walking.   Ordered a pulled pork sandwich on the pretzel bun, and my BF ordered the brisket sandwich (on same bun), both with the \"spicy\" cajun fries. SPOILER ALERT: not at all spicy.   We were both so hungry that no comments were made while we both experienced our lukewarm, soggy, stale sandwiches knowing that we paid too much for them.   Oh well."}
{"text":"We were a group of 12 (we reserved beforehand obviously) and we were seated and given two menus. For the entire table. The waitress said they had a shortage of menus and were ordering new ones next week. Uhh, really? First off, we were the only ones sitting inside of the restaurant. There were a few people outside on the terrace, but you really couldn't provide enough menus? it took forever to even order.  Then came the ordering. I ordered one appetizer and the mac and cheese. Because I ordered an appetizer, I declined having the 2 side dishes the mac and cheese came with. The mac and cheese on the menu said $16.95, so I was expecting a big serving. Much to my surprise, out comes the smallest and saddest little plate of mac and cheese I've ever seen. I asked the waitress, nicely, why it was so small and she said that was a \"half\" mac and cheese. I never ordered half of anything! I had to re-order the side dishes because of how little my portion was. They ended up billing me $8.95 for the mac and cheese instead, but what a bizarre experience. I only rated it 2 stars because the food was actually quite good, but the service was an absolute mess. It's too bad because i have no complaints with the food, but I would never go here again."}
{"text":"We ate at the bar on a semi-busy Friday, and service was quick and attentive.  My exposure to barbecue is limited to Dinosaur BBQ and Limp Lizard in Syracuse NY, so by no means an expert, just a regular schmoe hunkering for a dose of gout-inducing (this is a compliment), mouth watering animal protein turned succulent main course. Diablo's beef brisket and pork barbecue didn't disappoint. It was so good, we ordered another half rack of the pork ribs. Many napkins were killed in the eating process as the ghost pepper hot sauce kept the salivary glands pumping. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Horrible! Waited for so long for a salad... asked for no dressing and had to send it back. The chicken was so bland... When we asked for the check they gave us the wrong one!"}
{"text":"Visited during Grand Prix so it was busy - service was slow but ok. Delicious shrimp Po-boy sandwich and terrible poutine. Amazing cocktail selection though for reasonable prices. Worth a try"}
{"text":"Food was overpriced for the quality. A small pulled pork sandwich on a dry crusty bun with fries and a biscuit the size of a toonie for $15. My buddy got an undercooked burger, also small, for $20.   If you feel like feeling sadder for some reason then come here.  Go to Le Boucan Smokehouse in Griffintown for a much better experience  (Not walking distance from here)"}
{"text":"This was the best BBQ place in Canada, it was like being in the South! The brisket was so tender and was like candy. The drinks were unique and very good- the Perfect Storm was amazing! A definite must go! Don't think twice."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place because it managed to combine Canadian, Cajun, and BBQ into one menu. This place is located on an easily accessible street. The decor is beautiful and authentic, with wooden tables and walls, a stylish bar, and Texas-style memorabilia. The menu was pretty cheap and featured authentic BBQ classics as well as some Canadian inspired meals, such as BBQ poutine. Service is bilingual and accommodating. We started off with their expensive entree portion Caesar salad which was one of the best I've ever had. The untraditional salad, served like lettuce strips and not shredded lettuce. The vinagrette was delicious and the bacon and cheese was really nice in the dish. The flavor combinations proved why this place is so successful. We also got their poutine, which was yummy, but wasn't elevated enough to fit the BBQ concept. Their steak tips were yummy, with a nice smoked flavor. Their brisket was very moist and had great contrast with the spicy Cajun fries. The pulled pork wasn't amazing, but it did have most of the authentic flavors I was looking for."}
{"text":"Food was good had a good time drinks were nice as well!! They also have a terrace which is a plus. Service was good they were very nice will go back for sure"}
{"text":"I was dissapointed to find out that the instituition known as Eurodeli was no longer and had been replaced by another Southern BBQ joint....ofcourse that was BEFORE i actually tried Diablos! This is Southern BBQ done right! The service was exellent, dranks are great and served in these very cool boot glasses which i wanted to steal. And the BRISKET....well its insane.Even the bathrooms were impressive. Eurodeli What......."}
{"text":"Good service, decent poutine. Pork ribs were not \"falling of the bone\", a little chewy and too much fat. Beef ribs were not as fatty but same \"chewy\" experience.   Brisket was good but you had to cut your way through too much fat ....fattiest I've ever had. The portion looked large upon first sight thus disappointing. The onion stack rings were brutal...very dry and over cooked. Was excited upon arrival, left disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered a Diablos Burger ... it was way too dry but the service was ok"}
{"text":"Went to Montreal with a few friends and found this spot while walking around aimlessly.  We went in early afternoon and the bartender served up a few delicious drinks and provided some beers as well.  Each beer had a story to go along with it, which was interesting.  The bartender was also very friendly and professional.  I can't comment on the atmosphere as we went during a dead time in the afternoon but it's good to see a bartender in tune with his craft."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon and the place was empty except for another table of guys. This of course allowed more time/attention from the manager(owner?); I've got to say, I don't know what previous reviewers were talking about-- the guy we met was awesome! He was very friendly, not small talk friendly but ACTUAL conversations friendly.  I ordered the half rack of baby back ribs with fries and cornbread. My friend got the same except with coleslaw instead of the fries.   Ribs: okay, I don't know if I just hadn't had ribs in a long time and I was just really homesick and craving... OR THOSE RIBS WERE THE BOMB! They were slathered with just the right amount of BBQ sauce (you can never have too much when it comes to ribs though) and the meat was that perfect consistently where it could fall of the bone without much effort but it hasn't. AGHHH so good! I must return!  Fries: not going to lie, the ribs were so good that I don't remember if I liked the fries. But honestly speaking, fries are my favourite thing in the world and so if I don't remember these then they were probably between mediocre and alright.  Cornbread: Damn. Who'd have thought you'd find good cornbread in Montreal? It was delicious! I could taste the buttery goodness in it but it wasn't at all greasy/oily. Couldn't get enough of it.  Coleslaw: I'm not a coleslaw person but my friend said that it was good. It was purple though-- not sure if that's a Montreal thing?  Overall: I didn't get anything to drink, just water. So all together, including tip, I paid about $30. This is normally the price range I would pay (on the higher end though) at the smokehouses back home so normally this would be okay. BUT the portions were small. Usually when I go out for ribs (or something to that variety), I'm overwhelmed by the amount of food that's put in front of me. I wasn't really wow-ed though.  And I finished it. Easily. Never have I ever finished a whole meal at a smokehouse-- I usually end up having to take home a little container of leftovers.  Yeah so absolutely delicious but WAY overpriced for the portions."}
{"text":"Here's why we gave up without having eaten anything after waiting for two and a half hours...  I get that our first visit was on Christmas. I was expecting slower service likely due to being understaffed and being one of the only restaurants open outside of Chinatown.   -we made a reservation and was seated rather quickly.  - we waited 20 minutes until we had to flag down someone just to take our drink order.  -we waited another 30 minutes just to get those drinks. -60 minutes in, our 6 year old was hungry, we asked if they could bring a piece of bread.or anything to tide her over. They could not. -1.5 hours in, my husband had to go to the dep to get our child a snack because her stomach hurt from hunger - many tables had come, eaten and left in the two hours we had waited for our appetizer. -2 hours in, we wanted to know if we were getting food, the manager checked the kitchen and said that it was coming right up... -2.5 hours in, our appetizer finally came. It didn't have half the things described on the menu and the chicken wings were undercooked and juices were running pink. - at that point we were finished with this place and decided to leave. The manager told us that the smoking process turns the chicken pink and that we should \"look it up\" we did and if anyone's curious the flesh can be pink, but not the juices or near close to the bone. - we wished the customers beside us that had been waiting as long as us without any food either,  \"good luck\" and left.  Ugh...  -"}
{"text":"New bbq place in st. laurent  is really good at a really good price i cant decided wich place a i like the most blackstrap or diablos they both are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I recently went here and I thought that the food was good. I ordered a half rack of ribs and while it was better than your average smoked BBQ it's wasn't mind blowing. The pros about this place was that the meat was flavorful, service was great, and the food was served quickly. What I wasn't a fan of was that it was a little pricey."}
{"text":"One of our must go to restaurants when visiting Montreal. It's on a super cool street with plenty to see.  The food is AMAZING! Best ribs in Montreal that we've tried. This time we also got the burnt ends, and they were even better than expected. My girlfriend said they were one of the best things she's ever eaten, and actually hasn't stopped talking about them.  The maque choux was also really really good! The beans were a bit spicy, but tasted awesome, and was a very tasty hot.  As always, a great meal and great experience"}
{"text":"...Damn, you are the ultimate seduction...  Master of grabbing my soul and my tummy and making me leave my heart in this place.  Damn, your perfectly crispy and not over-salted fried pickles.  Damn, your perfection on a plate in a form of moist brisket over-loaded on a crispy bun.  Damn, your yummiest BBQ sauce and sides that are sinful in their deliciousness. Damn, your endless beers on tap and old-fashioned that rocked my world into oblivion.  Damn, your cute waitress and decor that goes with a mood on cold winter day.  Damn you for being so perfect, but so far away, Diablos. Love for eternity & beyond."}
{"text":"Would have loved to try this restaurant with great reviews & after seeing a post on their Instagram yesterday of a poutine, came down only to be told they are closed for renovations. Maybe this should be included in their social media posts."}
{"text":"I would give this a zero if i could.  We show up as a group of 5 people to a half empty restaurant, ask if they have place for us, which they obviously do. The absolutely lost waiter talks to us, says he'll see what he can do, starts roaming around and then disappears out of sight. Reappears several minutes later just to give us this \"you are still here\" look and then says they don't have room for 5 people. No, they can not put two of these tables together. Me and my friends left dumbfounded. Surely enough we found another place to eat and surely enough none of us is ever setting a foot in this place. Make sure you are no more than 4 when you attempt to visit this joint. Or better go elsewhere where they want your money"}
{"text":"I pass by this place on a daily and have never been here. I decided to try it out because my friends and I wanted to eat out somewhere with a patio. They offered a set lunch menu for $15 ($17.25 with tax). The lunch menu included mac and cheese with chorizo, Diablo's burger, smoked chicken sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, 1/4 rack of ribs, etc with a choice of either fries or salad. The lunch menu includes a free beer (Sleeman) as well, but you can substitute the beer for juice, wine, etc. I got the 1/4 rack of ribs with fries. The service took a while because the waiter was working the tables and in the back as well. When my food arrived, the waiter informed me that I got the last of the ribs in the pot. So they gave me a bit of the pulled pork as well. The ribs were really good! I didn't even have to use my hands to eat them because the meat just came off the bone. The sauce was really good, but it was a bit too thick in my opinion. The pulled pork had flavour and was decent, but it was cold when we got our food. The fries were good. They were thinly sliced (a bit too thin in my opinion) and had a good amount of spice on them. I would definitely come here if I wanted ribs, but other than that it's a decent restaurant to go to.  PS. They have free wifi."}
{"text":"I wish I had read yelp reviews before placed my order here.  1 beef rib and a tiny slice of a beef brisket with tiny sides costed $30+. The rib was decent, but a bit too fatty, did not fall off the bone. The brisket was a thin dry crispy slice covered in BBQ sauce, didn't even notice it in my bag at first. Out of the whole order a side coleslaw was nice (probably the worst compliment to a BBQ place)"}
{"text":"Just arrived in Montreal, walked around the city for a while till we got a hunger going on. Walked by, seen the sign \"all you can eat ribs\"... Jackpot!  Decor was mediocre, but it was a smokehouse, not the Ritz. Baby back ribs and Cajun fries were the choices to devour. Each new rib has more meat than the one before! How can they do that? oh my...  Great ribs, nice and tender. only issue I had was the BBQ sauce... there was no variety. just their one sauce.  great at first, but by the time I was on my fourth, I was done. not full, but sauced out. if there was a mix up of flavours, I'd still be there."}
{"text":"Le service était sympatique et courtois.  Ambiance: trop de lumière, on se sent dans une cafétéria alors que le décor pourrait être mis en valeur. une partie du souper sans musique.   Nourriture: les bouritos très moyens ( un sans goût l'autre sans plus ), le poulet panné ok, le poulet fumé bon goût mais cuisson à ajusté pour améliorer la tendresse. le drink était ni mauvais ni bon.  Personnellement je n'y retournerai pas."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for service and food was cold.  Waitress was forgetting the orders etc...  Bad experience"}
{"text":"Not very good, there was no BBQ sauce or mustard or any other BBQ stuff, hot sauce etc... On the table or bottles to buy and bring home. The portions are too small and everything was very oily?? Not in a fun greasy bbq way, more in the way someone was in the back going nuts putting oil all over the dishes so nothing sticks. The food seems very uninspired.   I would recommend this place if you have never left Montreal or eaten BBQ anywhere else. I receive the impression that this place is catering more towards St. Laurent downtown crowd, gluten free blah blah and low carb what not, which is a very \"city approach\" to BBQ. Sandwiches were light on meat and heavy on buns and coleslaw. All the unique signature \"only here\" BBQ side dishes may as well come from a grocery store, coleslaw, potato salad, maquechoux, were all very bland, boring, very oily and not very flavorful. There was no hot sauce, BBQ sauce or spices anywhere and no ability to add any myself.   It seems like a good place for drinks, maybe lunch. If you are looking for a saucy, meaty, BBQ pigout you should keep looking."}
{"text":"We went here for Christmas Day dinner. Place was packed and they had to keep turning people away! Anyway we were seated and then didn't get menus or water for 20 minutes. We asked the female server to take our order and she informed us our server was actually the male who had been standing behind the bar doing nothing but talking to some people for the 20 minutes we'd been waiting. Not a great look and especially since this poor woman was running around trying to do everything.  After waiting another 10 minutes for him to make an appearance she came back over and said she'd look after us. He then started serving tables around us and gave a table who had gotten there 45 minutes after us our meal, making us wait over an hour and a half for our meal. Again, not a great look and it's Christmas Day!  The female server deserves a medal for having to juggle so many things at once with minimal help and I could tell we weren't the only table experiencing problems.   The food when we got it was half cold, half hot. We ordered the platter for two, and the nicest part was the pork ribs. If I'd go back I'd only get pork ribs in future.  Because of the stuff around she did compensate us which was kind.  All I can say is I can't imagine Christmas Day is their only busy day so they need to put more measures in place to have a more successful service, not just one person doing the lions share of everything! Get the pork ribs and you won't be sad you did!"}
{"text":"Un peu cher mais délicieux. .  J'ai choisi le demi poulet frit. Une belle peau croustillante.  J'ai goûté à l'autre assiette, la personne qui m'accompagnait. Un plat de porc effiloché  sauce BBQ, j'ai reconnu raifort, sauce Worcestershire, cassonade, tomate.  Côté dessert, j'ai choisi un décadent brownies au bacon (j'ai évidemment goûté au pouding au pain à la banane.  Les 2 plats avaient un goût de fumée et de caramélisation. Côté légumes, on a le choix entre purée de pommes de terre ou un mélange de maïs et poivron.  J'y retourne, c'est sur"}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off-night for the restaurant, but this experience left me turned off.   From the moment we arrived we weren't noticed. The poor waitress was alone and really trying to keep up - so she can't be blamed. She was lovely. But the manager seemed less than interested in helping her out. Personally, I dislike when I'm not receiving service (being seated, getting water, placing order) and there is staff on their phone.   Food: was pretty good for southern comfort BBQ! I had the Combo#1, smoked chicken and pork ribs with side cornbread and salad. The ribs were delicious! Wish I had more. They were moist and tasty, not too saucy. The chicken was also moist, very good. The cornbread was light and fluffy.   If return for the food, but not the atmosphere/ service. After the show I witnessed with the manager and a client, and my own service, I'd sooner try something new than come back. Sorry, Diablos, but there is far too much competition in the city to settle!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grab dinner and decided to give this place a go - admittedly because the decor looked pretty cool.  We sat on the terrace, and ordered a shrimp po'boy and a brisket on pretzel bun. The food took quite some time to come out. The menu did mention (as a cautionary?) that Diablos BBQ was not a fast food joint, and therefore time should be given for proper food preparation. Still, we felt that the main reason was understaffing, as the only waiter running around was obviously overloaded.  The meal itself was delicious, but portions were way too small. The food lacked the oomph factor typically associated with southern BBQ, which is well known for gigantic racks of meat and other generous cuts. I guess it was a good thing because we were supposed to eat healthy that week, but what is a cheat day without overeating?  Good food (wonderful cornbread!), but a bit disappointing for the aforementioned reasons."}
{"text":"Recently had supper at Diablos with a group of friends. Nice ambiance and good service.  We went quite early 6;30 and the resto was quiet....would recommend later supper as it picks up around 8pm. Food was okay at best. Had the rib plate with fries which was okay at best."}
{"text":"This place was average.  I liked the sangria and the deep fried pickles. Also, the chicken wings are huge."}
{"text":"Fantastic food with friendly staff. Deliciously slow cooked food for BBQ and spice lovers. Great selection of beers and cocktails"}
{"text":"Decent brisket, but nothing to write home about but this: two day-old \"pretzel buns\"; dry pulled pork; cast iron \"serving platters\" that impart delectable metallic flavors to your food and transfer any heat from the food to the plate (at least season the platters before using them!), as well as ungenerous serving sizes.   (Also, when numerous bottles of \"Real Lemon\" are stocked in the pantry, it means the lemons purchased for the restaurant are likely reserved for use as decoration in mixed drinks)."}
{"text":"This place is great. Vicky was an awesome waitress. Very kind and respectful. Best place I've been in Montreal"}
{"text":"This is not proper BBQ of any sort!  Wings lack any flavor whatsoever.  Brisket and chicken combo is a joke- 1/4 inch slice of cold brisket with 50% fat content and undercooked chicken smothered in bottled BBQ sauce with liquid smoke is not edible!  Don't waste your money..."}
{"text":"Located on the VERY busy St-Laurent street, Diablos is quickly gaining a reputation of being the place to go to get some quality BBQ grub... and that might be true!  Pros   - I went with a full rack of pork ribs and they were GREAT! Also... HUUUGE! Succulent, fall off the bone goodness that filled me far more than I expected it to. The BBQ sauce was excellent. Did I mention it was HUGE? You gotta try this!  - We ordered a large portion of the battered pickles and they were very good! And as a Yelper, you get 50% off when you check-in... so hey... THANK YOU YELP!  - Service was efficient and friendly. Our waitress was very accommodating and on point.   Cons   - The appetizer pulled pork sliders were very underwhelming. I don't know if it was the pull pork or it was the buns but all in all, it left all of us wanting and comparing it to the delicious fried pickles, the difference was night and day.  - I ordered an alcoholic drink (root beer float) and while it was very good, it was also small. For its price, ($8.50) I didn't think I got great value off this. I would have ordered 2-3 drinks if they were more moderately priced.   - Nothing they can personally do about this last point but the parking nearby on St-Laurent... SUCKS HARD!"}
{"text":"I was very unhappy with my experience at Diablos.   We went there for a group birthday dinner. Our group was about 40 people and the restaurant capacity is perhaps 60-80. We were given a fixed menu to order from of an appetizer, main and dessert.   Our waitress took drink orders and brought our drinks rather quickly, which was good. It was pretty much downhill after that.   The restaurant was extremely uncomfortable without any air conditioning and it was over 30 C last night. The employees were visibly sweating too.   Our appetizers took over an hour to start coming out. Guests went outside to smoke multiple times hoping their food would be waiting for them, but alas no. The waitress continuously told us that the food would arrive in 5 minutes. Finally orders started being served. Many guests received their appetizers, but half of us on our table waited another 25 minutes while our friends finished their appetizers. Eventually my burned ends came and they were not very good at all, despite the waitresses recommendation.   We then waited over an hour to start seeing main courses. Once again, there was a large gap of time between my plate being served and the rest of my table. The final plates to be served at my table got their mains an hour after I did. The servers offered to comp their pitcher of sangria, but I felt their meal should have been comped.  I had the beef rib on the waitress' recommendation again, and it was probably the best thing they had, although I thought it was pretty average or below average. My potato salad was not good (I only took a few bites to try it). The corn bread was definitely not made fresh and was not very tasty. People at my table ordered the pork ribs and they were burned pretty badly. They were over-smoked too. The ribs were dry, lacked taste and had an overpowering taste of smoke.   I am not an American BBQ expert, but I have eaten BBQ in many restaurants in the USA, and I know what it is supposed to taste like. And I also know that BBQ is prepared way in advance and so there should be almost no waiting time for the food to be served, so this restaurant was pretty ridiculous for serving times. Besides, we were a large group with a reservation, weren't they ready for the rush?  The fixed menu included a dessert, but once the guests ate their main courses and the plates were cleared away, the servers didn't offer us dessert at all. Once we at our table asked if we could get dessert, the waitress asked us what we would like. There was a choice of brownie and banana cream pie. I asked for the pie and the waitress told me there was none left. This begged the question, \"Why did you even offer me a choice?\" After yet another long wait, the waitress arrived at our table with our dessert in take-away plates. So I asked the waitress if I was allowed to finish my meal in the restaurant, to which she replied that everyone had asked for their dessert to go. No one at our table said such a thing. At this point, the waitress looked pretty annoyed at me and told us she would ask the kitchen to make more brownies... Which meant that she didn't have enough brownies in to-go plates anyway! After waiting for 20 minutes, I finally just paid my bill and told the waitress to cancel my brownie. I can not confirm if that brownie is ready yet.   I will not go back to this restaurant and I do not recommend it to anyone. Bad service, slow kitchen, below average food, no courtesy. And no AC! To boot, I ended up with serious indigestion all night."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp would add a zero star option. I can't comment on the food, only the service, as my group of 4 people that had a reservation waited 30 minutes at our table for our DRINK order to be taken! Then it was only taken because we got up and went over to a different server who took the drink order and then never returned with them. In the meantime our \"server\" told us he'd be with us in one minute about 15 minutes in and then 15 minutes after that he came by and said he knows we're hungry and we've been waiting, and then walked away from us again! We debated getting up to leave and then when we saw the server go take the food order from a party that came in way after us we immediately all stood up and walked out. We then spent our $230 on food and drinks at Rubs a few doors down so hopefully the server reads this and realizes his pockets are about $45 lighter! But he didn't seem to care so whatever. Maybe we're spoiled because in NY we'd never be treated this way or kept waiting for so long without so much as a drink order or chips or something. If I was in Montreal another few nites I would have spent them camped in front of Diablo's discouraging people from going in. DON'T GO THERE!"}
{"text":"Bel endroit , la bouffe est incroyablement bonne ! Les burnt ends son delicieuse ainsi que le poulet frit fumé    Le proprio est super gentil et a lecoute de sa clientele !   Un endroit authentique et chaleureux !"}
{"text":"Testé uniquement le midi, les ribs étaient secs, arrosés de sauce barbecue pour sauver l'ensemble, mais ça ne m'a pas convaincu...dommage, moi qui m'attendais à manger les meilleurs côtes levées de la ville..."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. In the heart of old Montreal this little roadhouse offered large servings of meat and a very wide range of drinks; over 100 in the menu alone! My only knock is that on the night we went there was only one server for the 10 or so tables. Service could have been more attentive and I would have loved it if they took Amex but all in all it was a very enjoyable night."}
{"text":"Really happy to see these guys bringing something good to St Laurent. The new room is in the old Euro Deli location, right above Prince Arthur. It's all wood and exposed brick and a lunch menu that gives you a pile of pulled pork or mac and cheese with sausage and a side salad or fries and a beer for $13. It's warmer and higher-end feeling than the place on St Denis (currently closed due to fire) and it's definitely high on the short list of places where I would actually hang out on lower St Laurent. Same smoked and bbq'd meat and nice staff and general joyful focus on trying to do something delicious and great downtown. Good folks, go say hi!"}
{"text":"I should have followed my gut feeling as I walked through the door, but hindsight is 20/20 and I ended up eating here anyways.   The waitress was lovely, but service was slow from getting a table (I had to approach the kitchen to find staff, and the manager was outside on his phone most of the night) to getting water and placing our order. Not the waitresses fault; she was alone and without help. After that however, the food came in good time.   There was quite the situation at the table next to me though, where the manager and the client began to argue over a wrong order. Seriously off-putting and the compensation and attitude weren't making up for the sour taste that client was left with that spilled over to our table at witnessing the event. Further, they had to re-negotiate when the bill came!   I ordered Combo #1, smoked chicken and pork ribs with cornbread and salad. The food was pretty OK - Good comfort food, done well, and tasty.   For a taste of the south, I'd come again. It was truly the experience that left me thinking next time, I'll try someplace else.   I also ordered the Jack fire after seeing the add on the screen. Nice flavour and a bit sweet. However like others I felt the quantity was on the low side and price was high.  I wouldn't come back for drinks."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, filling portion, but not huge. No sauce provided at the table. Friendly owner. Service was really off, but I expect it was because they were understaffed. Nice seating area outside. Could use a wipe down, though."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out because it seemed pretty cool and I had walked by dozens of times. The location is fantastic- but this is probably one of the best things about it.   I ordered a lemonade drink with vodka and to my surprise it was red and extremely sweet. It didn't seem like lemonade at all. After putting in our orders, we ended up waiting almost an hour to get our food. We each got one of the combo plates- I got the beef ribs with smoked chicken and my boyfriend got the pork ribs with smoked chicken. My ribs were extremely fatty and had very little meat on them. The chicken was ok, but nothing special, especially after such a long wait. I got a side of mashed potatoes and cornbread. The mashed potatoes were good, but the cornbread was really dense, cold, and quite a disappointment.  After a disappointing meal, I can say with certainty that I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We arrived in Montreal on Christmas Eve. Our food choices were limited but this BBQ joint was really on point with their food and service."}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  The food is disgusting...lumpy curdling Mac n' Cheese and very dry brisket that was clearly reheated and fried the sides. Consistency similar to an overcooked pork chop, anyone who knows a good brisket knows the bark shouldn't be on all sides and the meat should not be grey and tough like an over cooked pork chop. This was clearly refried and stored not fresh smoke house at all.  They charged $80 for a variety plate of all the supposedly smoked meats (i dont think they really smoke anything there) they say it serves 3-4 people but we were all still starving after the plate was finished. Ended up having to go to McDonalds to eat. I feel like i was robbed. They gave half a biscuit for 4 people.   Sensing we were not happy they offered us a free pitcher of beer which we refused because we were way too hungry to get more drunk. Never Goring back again!!!   SAVE YOUR MONEY TRUST ME!"}
{"text":"Southern BBQ places have risen in popularity in and around Montreal in the last few years however many restaurants are very similar in that the style is to smoke or cook the meat then slather a bunch of sauce on it. If you have a chance to travel the Southern US you will see there are so many styles of BBQ. Kansas City style is where most Canadian BBQ derives many of it's flavours from. KC style is used with grilled meats usually ribs then basted with a sauce that is more tomato base. You head down to Texas and Texas Pit is King and Brisket rules house. Memphis is known for a ribs and the options are wet or dry rub (which I prefer) with sauce options on the side some infusing bourbon. in the Carolina's pulled pork is King and more of a tangy mustard-vinegar base sauce rules. These are the styles I really know and have experienced in my pre-yelp years.   So.....my experience is biased as I've had the fortunate opportunity to eat some excellent belly busting BBQ.   Diablos is okay but not the best I've eaten. Mediocre at best. I ordered the half rack of ribs with mash potato and house salad with corn relish. Reason it was mediocre. Meat was not fall off the bone. If you have to work at it to chew it it's not exceptional BBQ. Secondly the sauce tasted like it came out of a plastic bottle. No BBQ house should serve what tastes like I can get at my local grocery store. Thirdly an excellent BBQ  house should have exceptional sides. These sides were okay but nothing memorable or earth shattering. To wash it down I ordered a Mojito which was one of the worst ones I've had in a while. It came in a mason jar but did not taste very good but I still drank it.   Service was also a bit slow. From the time we ordered it seemed like 30-40 minutes till we received our food out on the terrace. Ribs when done right should be served within five minutes from ordering. The true professionals smoke a huge amount all day and all you need is to warm it up.   If you want to read about true BBQ check out Bucky's BBQ in Greenville, SC. Or else google Dreamland BBQ in Tuscaloosa, AL.   The food here is okay and edible just it takes more to impress me with high quality BBQ. Pricing is a bit higher but that's par for the course in Montreal.    I'd declare Triple Crown Dinette the best so far I've tried in MTL. Rubs is okay similar to diablos but more smoked flavour. My next place to check out is Blackstrap."}
{"text":"I went to Diablos for the first time today, and tbh I wasn't a big ribs fan, but after trying the ribs in Diablo ( as my friend is in love with it), I would say they got me, I'm a fan now! It's ribs with BBQ sauce, comes with great fries, and if you want an extra side. We got mashed potatoes which was different, but yet delicious. The ribs are very big, so it's also good to share it.  They also have a nice terrace with a St-Laurent view, so it's a nice spot for the summer."}
{"text":"The restaurant in old Montreal looked so promising! It's at the bottom of rue McGill right on the first lock of the Lachine canal, overlooking the water. Ordered the famous ribs last night, asked if I wanted half rack or whole rack. Since I love their ribs I  ordered whole rack. But what I got was 6 ribs! When I asked if they made a mistake I was told \"they cost so much now, and it's expensive here\". Said they were sorry but didn't look like he cared much. So charge MORE! but don't pretend you're serving a whole rack! Tasted great but very disappointed - won't be eating there again :-("}
{"text":"Went with a group if 6 people and guess we missed a rush as we had restaurant to ourselves 7pm on a Sunday. Ribs were falling off the bone, chicken was tender, brisket a little tough, great looking and tasting salad, and homemade mashed potatoes. Sangria a little sweet but other mixed drinks were good. Nice rustic decor for bbq place. I'd go again."}
{"text":"L'expérience commence sur une mauvaise note... Je dois demander à changer mon verre de bière, parsemé de taches graisseuses.  Ensuite, mon sandwich de porc effiloché est sec et froid. Le serveur m'explique que c'est parce que la sauce est conservée au frigo... Merci pour l'explication! La salade de pommes de terre choisie en accompagnement n'a aucune saveur. Ma copine a commandé une poutine fumée. Sauce goûteuse, mais hyper salée, fromage bien frais, frites acceptables, mais encore ici, un problème de température : elle était déjà tiède lorsqu'elle est arrivée à notre table.  On y retournera jamais."}
{"text":"First off, props to the waiter who was all on his own for the whole restaurant. I did not wait long for my food, but getting my check took long and I sat with an empty glass for quite a while. The food was just ok, the potato salad was really displeasing,but being from the south, I may just be used to more salty/ fattening cuisine. The waiter convinced me to get my old fashioned \"smoked\" not overly impressed, but to each his own."}
{"text":"I went there once, I ate pork ribs, it was good but a little bit cold. My friend had pulled pork burger, the meat was cold too but the French frites was very good !"}
{"text":"Went there on a cold Tuesday in February. Ordered the beef brisket with (spicy) baked beans and coleslaw. Friends had beef short rib and Mac n Cheese. We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals!  Brisket was tender and flavorful with just the right amount of spice and sauce. Our waiter turned out to be the owner. Bonus!  So, we got a great education on Louisiana style (he used to live there pre-Katrina) cooking and an even better education on Bourbon!  You can't leave without trying one of their multiple selections. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, with 4 adults and 2 small kids. We had made reservations ahead of time via Bookenda (they were unable to find it), but they accommodated anyway. When I made the reservation, they made me aware that they did not have high chairs. Which wasn't terrible, just slightly annoying (I found out that most places in Montreal are like this)  Clearly I was a tourist. We chose this place because it seemed the most family friendly, with great food. The food was truly delicious, we ordered The Dixie Normous and it fed 4 of us adults perfectly.   The drinks on the other hand were ok. Nothing amazing. We ordered a Sangria pitcher, and 2 old fashioned's. Considering I live in the states, their bourbon list was pretty decent. You can't go wrong with bourbon. Except I asked them for an Old Fashioned, and it was incomplete.  Overall, a great BBQ place."}
{"text":"I wish I had caught our servers name, but we were here Sunday night and she was an absolute rock star. Truly one of the best servers I've ever had. But the sad thing I was able to watch so much of her handiwork was simply this sad fact: this is not a functional restaurant (and she saves this from being a one-star review).   We arrived here with a group of eight with an OpenTable reservation. That reservation was absolutely meaningless. Not because the restaurant was full, but because there was no one there to seat us. We were polite and stood at the \"Please let us seat you,\" sign for far too long before seating ourselves. We noticed that only one of the many seated tables had food and it was at that point that it became clear that there was only one server. At this point, had I been by myself or with a smaller party, I would have left, but since we were such a large group and I was there for the company, we stuck it out.   The server was so apologetic and did her absolute best, but we waited for menus, for drinks, and for food for a crazy amount of time. They were out of chicken, hush puppies, and a few other menu items. They only had light versions of the beers that were ordered.   The food: perfectly in line with yelp's two-star standard quote of \"meh, I've experienced better.\" But the server split the large group check perfectly for our individual orders, and that, to be honest, is no small miracle and we were thankful for it.   All in all, if the restaurant matched the quality of our server, this would be quite the dinner spot."}
{"text":"Had a good time. went with my teenage son.atmosphere was nice. service was excellent.my waitress was very friendly. refilled my soft drink before I asked. best service I had in a long time.my son had a hamburger and fries he really liked it.I had the ribs fries and coleslaw. the coleslaw I think it's homemade very good.The only down part was the french fries I think they should work on that.besides that everything was perfect. I would give it five stars.  but like I said they have to do something about the french fries.Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Way way worse than when they were on Saint Denis. I had been 3 times before they moved. Now everything is much worse. The portions are tiny. The fried chicken is bland - Kfc is better.  The staff is split between people working hard and people chatting or on their phones. The waitress and bus boy had the hole room.  42$ for a drink and 1/2 rack of ribs. Micro potion of coleslaw and mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Amazing ribs, friendly staff, and great drinks!The fries were well seasoned the meat on the ribs fall right off the bone.The only thing that my friend and i disliked was that the sauce was too sweet and believe me: I love a sweet bbq sauce but this one was too sweet. I also noticed the ribs were not that marinated. I tried a piece without any sauce and all i could taste was the smoke but there was no actual flavor to the ribs. Maybe a little salt and pepper before smoking them would help?"}
{"text":"Wow!  The fried smoked chicken was worth the trip.  Great southern food, cooked right, north of the border.  Great service.  Perfect atmosphere.  Can't wait to go back."}
