{"text":"We have ate here several times.  The kids love the fact it's a \"bar\" and they can go.  The space is inviting and the food is great.  We have tried almost everything on the menu and never had a bad meal.  We also will order in from this place of business.  Sometimes the servers enjoy visiting with one another more then helping customers."}
{"text":"Worst customer service in years!! Hour to get a drink... two hours forfood, cant tell you how it tasted, it never showed up ,before i paid my tab! And the food was on it!!  No apologies for the reg priced happy hour Caesars either. manageress needs some career counselling!"}
{"text":"It's a sports bar next to the Wyndham Inn.  If not staying there it is hard to find otherwise.  Numerous tv screens.  They have drink specials.  They have 12 oz mugs and 16 oz pints.  Long gone are the days of 20 oz pints...which are true pints by definition. Not a bad place to hang out.  There is a quieter area in the back.  Typical pub food.  Nothing special. They have a summer patio."}
