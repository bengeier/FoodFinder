{"text":"It's not good and it's not cheap- easily the laziest food in Geauga county, everything came out of a bag-  none of the meats were smoked and it's probably the worst attempt at Mac and cheese that you will ever see- seriously please don't waste the time or the money on this place-"}
{"text":"First time on a Friday night.It was busy. We were hungry so we dug into the ribs and brisket. They were a 7 out of 10. Why? Because they are not yet rib experts- ribs are low and slow and basted with sauce. It seems they bar-b-que the ribs and then pour your choice of sauce on top. This makes for efficiency but not top shelf bar-b-que.
Also I love vegetables when done right, veggies are an afterthought here and are served in a small bowl, are too soggy and over cooked.
The restaurant is a country modern decor and had a good feel to it.
We will probably frequent this place because it is close and has a good bar. The ketchup has cane sugar as an ingredient so health types and Whole 30's will be disappointed.
The place is new and hopefully will upgrade the food despite some early success, otherwise the sheen will wear off fast. My guess is that the owners are entrepreneurs and not so much restaurateurs with a food focus"}
{"text":"Not good had mussels so salty was soaked in oil luke warm and very small expensive. Bread was soaked in broth
.wifes ribs were smothered in sause hard over cooked greasy
Beers way over priced

{"text":"Was very disappointed with this restaurant.  Had their ribs a few weeks ago and they were awesome!  Called today to order takeout ---- full slab dinner with some extras.  They do NOT do takeout orders over the phone!  Only if you come into the bar and place a take-out order! What a SCAM!  Their way of getting you into their restaurant and bar to order their way overpriced beer!"}
{"text":"GREAT BBQ! We tried this restaurant and then read the reviews which were rather shocking. All the food we had was excellent. Pub Chips go great with beer. Salty but addictive.The chicken quesadilla was generously stuffed with smokey chicken. Ribs were melt in your mouth tender. Pulled pork and Brisket both had nice smoke and was very tender. Even the cole slaw was fresh & delicious. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went in around 5:30 on a Saturday and had a 30-35 minute wait. We decided on sitting at the bar instead, which we enjoyed. The restaurant itself is very nice. The service at the bar was prompt and very friendly (excellent bartender!). We (2) shared the BBQ mix of three meats, which was choose your own. We got pulled chicken, brisket, and Cajun shrimp. It came with fries, baked beans, and cornbread. The food came in a reasonable amount of time, had a perfect temperature, and was very good. The cornbread was awesome, but could be bigger...or two per person!

I think, with time, the restaurant will figure out its seating and prices. There is plenty of room for more seating and introducing a happy hour or drink specials will make the restaurant even more appealing. By the time we left the place was packed with waiting customers. Having more seating will greatly improve wait times!

We enjoyed our visit very much and will come back for sure. Very happy to have a quality restaurant in Munson Twp!

{"text":"We tried to make a reservation for our party of 10 on a Saturday night and were told they don't take reservations. We arrived at 6:00 and were told we should be seated by 7:00. At 7:00 we were told that it \"shouldn't be much longer\". At 7:30 we were informed that the manager (Greg) would not allow us to be seated because the kitchen could not keep up with the orders, however, smaller parties were being seated.  If the size of our group was an issue they should have told us before we stood outside waiting for 1 1/2 hours. Greg was unable to,speak with us because he was \"in the kitchen\". Another large group was waiting as well...we all ended up leaving. I will never return due to the poor treatment we received."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, but the dinner I ordered, brisket dinner, fell short of our expectations. The meat was described as slow-smoked. However, the brisket meat served had no tell-tale signs of being smoked, more of boiled then thinly-sliced. I also tried the baby rack ribs that my husband ordered--- those were chewy.

Did I find some redeeming points?!? Yes. Make sure you get their chicken wings, especially the cajun-spiced, dry rubbed wings. Those are phenomenal. Also, they do have good barbeque sauce! 

Are we coming back? Not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Tried it about a month ago. Waitress not very attentive at all. We absolutely hated the sauces. So many choices, maybe we picked the wrong ones. it would have been helpful to know which were the most popular sauces. I had the burnt ends with hot sauce. The ends were not burnt at all, no color just small cubes of meat  and the sauce was so vinegary I couldn't eat it. Told waitress I didn't like it. No effort to make it right. Too bad. It's very close to our house but we won't be back."}
