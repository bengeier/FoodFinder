{"text":"We stopped by for a drink after eating at Hayden Block. Surprised that the renos were more than just packaging. The \"other girlfriend\" was the best of the four cocktails we had, but none of them were duds. High quality cocktails at lower prices. Lots of pleasant staff, prompt services. Looking forward to going back to try the food. Sadly no Salisbury steak or liver and onions."}
{"text":"The ground floor restaurant and bar of the new Legion building on Kensington Rd is open to non-members. Our server informed us that the upper floor is reserved for members but that the same kitchen serves both floors. We sat on the sunny patio, divided from the street by flower filled planters.  Service was enthusiastic but not intrusive. The menu offered several good choices and we chose a lamb pasta and a burger. The pasta was very good, a light tomatoey sauce and plenty of shredded lamb shoulder. The burger was nicely topped with bacon and cheese and wrapped in a good bun.  This is a good place for a glass of wine, a light lunch, or a full dinner. We will definitely return here."}
{"text":"Home cooking and cheap cheap drinks.  That is pure Kensington Legion.  It's dark, old and the average age is 75 but it has TV's to watch the game, darts and shuffleboard.  I always feel young and vibrant...and super comfortable.  Would I be a regular - no...but do I pop in the occasional meat raffle after work for some comfort food ?  Yup.  They also do a great lunch and have ample parking."}
{"text":"Brand spanking new building with a beautiful patio for the lounge. The food and bar menu has had a refresh to match the spectacular new surroundings.  Servers are all super friendly and smiling.   Great place to make as your new local.  They are open to all but check into membership too as it goes through support a wonderful organization."}
{"text":"The Legion... wasn't my Grandpa a member? Yes, I do believe he was. And that's been my general impression of most legions. It's not where the young crowd hangs out. And yet... it seems they make for an alright venue when you're in need of a gathering or meeting place.  My first trip to the Kensington Legion was last night for a viewing of Top Chef Canada. The room we were in probably fit 100 or so people, maybe a little less. TVs lined the walls and we had full drink/food service.   Depending on what you require a venue for, you can also rent its big banquet hall, board room, games room with a/v services, catering, etc. also available.  The Legion... community events, happy hours... not just for my Granpda anymore. Who knew?!?!"}
