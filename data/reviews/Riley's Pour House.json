{"text":"Returned after nearly 15 to 20 years. Not the same as when it was Murphy's but still a very good Irish pub. Worth going to. Good service and proper Guinness."}
{"text":"I had been here maybe twice right after they opened and everything was always adequate. A place you go for a good tome with OK food and atmosphere. Nothing special and certainly not worth a drive from more than 15 minutes away. However the last two times we visited (since late June) it was miserable. No one likes to be at an establishment that over serves, or serves people who are already clearly intoxicated. But I guess a buck is a buck. However that does not make for a good time for anyone else in the vicinity of the overly drunk person(s). I lived in County Cork fro almost 9 years and once you live in Ireland no stateside food compares so I'll not comment on the food. Usually the service is adequate, it can get busy and loud so the servers do a good job keeping up but when you go to a pub expectations are lowered, this isn't the type of service you'd expect from a place that has a higher price point. Most people that frequent a pb know this and are ok with it, still the servers do a good job. I've only had two interactions with a male bartender and neither were good. So overall, based on public safety I have to rate this a 1 star."}
{"text":"Best brunch in Pittsburgh.  Food-wise and price-wise.  Check it out - but don't make it so popular we can't get a table for eight in the back corner anymore. :)"}
{"text":"Always a good time at Riley's. Open mic on Wednesday's is fun. Reuben egg rolls are really good!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends. Staff was friendly and prompt.   I would highly recommend stopping in for a drink and quick bite if you are looking in the area."}
{"text":"Casual food, chill atmosphere and very friendly staff..... What more could you really want? Outdoor patio is nice and they generally have live music of some type"}
{"text":"GREAT, GREAT, Neighborhood Irish Pub.  They do great live music, and pour excellent Guinness.  The owner is an excellent host.  Food is quality pub food.  I just love coming to Riley's Pour House whenever I get the chance."}
{"text":"Ate here with my wife. The food was really good. They recently bought the lot next door and transformed it into an awesome outdoor pavilion area  with live entertainment all the time. This part of Carnegie is turning into a great area to hang out. If you are looking for somewhere to meet with friends and have a few beers, and maybe order some quality bar food while being serenaded by a live band then look no further."}
{"text":"Decent food, great atmosphere. Service was slow but it was a Saturday night with live music."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why I don't go here more often!  The Pour House, despite changing owners, is just a small traditional Irish pub.  Good food and good company when you are there : )  Also, there are a lot of entertaining local musicians that play there in the evening."}
{"text":"Good beer, good food. Try the Reuben!, awesome atmosphere!   Definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Have only visited once so far, EXCELLENT!!!  Live music, great atmosphere, a lot of regulars and fantastic food! Will certainly go back, really a great vibe and place to go."}
{"text":"Every visit invigorates my nostrils!   I regretfully have not eaten here yet, but I am extremely eager to put their food in my mouth.  It's a fun place to grab a drink and sing Irish songs loudly -- and although it's pretty small, it's never packed to the point of obnoxiousness.   However, I hear the food is amazing and I believe it because I'm teased by the delightful smells every time I go. I did get a tiny sample recently when the special was a seafood crepe and the chef shoved a piece of crepe in my mouth as I walked by the kitchen. It. was. great.   I'm pretty sure last time I also saw something made with mashed potatoes that I need to eat too."}
{"text":"Ordinarily, I would not post about a place this cool, because I would want to keep my secret cool spaces secret! But I don't get over there too often now.  The space is nice. The staff is even nicer. The prices are reasonable, and the food is solid. It is not exactly authentic Irish food, mind you. It's inspired by British Isles cuisine, with a fair amount of Pittsburgh thrown in. Meaning, forget your diet for the day, alright?  What blows me away is the music. It may not be exactly my thing, but it's never too loud. Much of it is Irish inspired, but some is not. What follows Irish pub tradition, is that it is meant to bring the group together, and often meant to be sung along to. My favorite is when they have the guy playing piano. This is usually on a week night. When I walk into a place and can have a fantastic reuben (not very Irish...) with a Murphy's stout, and listen to a little ragtime, played live, I am a happy lad."}
{"text":"We always meant to stop in here when it was under the previous ownership but we never made it so I can't really comment on the changes.  I can say that this a great little pub if you like pub grub, great service, and fantastic live music in a small space.  We were going to just stop in for a pint, however, we saw and smelled some great food coming out of the kitchen so we ordered off the small menu.  The fish and chips were lovely.  The batter was nice and crispy and the fish was flavorful and not mish-mush.  My husband had the Reuben with a side of the colcannon.  Heaven!  Yes it is simple food, but it is done very very well.  Then we were lucky enough to be there when Sean McClorey started his set for the night.  I love the fact that he played a wee bit of traditional Irish songs, but also played songs by Irish artists I wouldn't hear anywhere else.  We will be back to try to the lamb stew and the cod cakes!"}
{"text":"Went to Riley's for the first time for a business lunch on a Friday recently.  The waitress suggested the fish and shrimp special, so I gave it a shot.  Fish was great.  A large, fresh-tasting filet in a crunchy beer batter coating.  The shrimp couldn't have been worse.  It was the same, flat, pre-frozen, pre-crumb breaded junk you would get in the supermarket or in the buffet line at a Golden Corral.  Surprised they would serve something like that with everything else on the menu looking fresh made.  Other than that, service was attentive but not particularly friendly.  The other odd thing was the piano player.  Not a bad idea during happy hours or in the late evening to keep things lively, but during the day it was loud and distracting when trying to keep a conversation."}
{"text":"Took 20-25 minutes to get a menu after we got up from our table and went to the bar for a drink. Never received our appetizer or our salads. Waited 20-25 minutes AFTER finishing our meals (which at least came out hot), for our check and had to go up and get it. Not impressed. Prices are reasonable, food quality is great... but without good service, none of that means a thing. Felt like an nuisance instead of a welcome guest."}
{"text":"We are regulars for Saturday breakfast and this place is beyond amazing! Service is fast and atmosphere is great. Portions will not disappoint and you can't beat $2 bloody Mary's and mimosas!"}
{"text":"Small, quaint, fun, and delicious. Prices are more than fair, staff is attentive and food is quite good. Great for a quick lunch or for a pint. Later in the evenings it gets packed but they have outside seating which has now been enclosed.  Parking can be a challenge and may require a small walk from the public parking area down the street. Do yourself a favor and stop in. I recommend the Reuben"}
{"text":"What a cool Irish pub.  Plenty of personality and such warm feeling inside.  I was pleasantly surprised with the prices since it \"wasn't\" happy hour at the time of my visits..  drafts were affordable and not overpriced.    The service was good while dining in.  Friday night 7:30.. . allow extra time for parking..  was a little challenging (off street parking) I can't wait to visit again.. thanks Riley's Pour House!"}
{"text":"I remember eating at this place prior to the name change years ago and the colcannon being excellent, so I stopped in to grab something to eat and to have a couple of drinks. When you walk in it's a long bar with tables on the other side and everything is decorated to fit the Irish theme. They also have a giant outside area.   It was early in the evening and there were people there but nowhere near crowded. I went and sat the bar and waited and waited and waited. I watched as the bartenders had conversations with themselves and what appeared to be their regulars. I sat and watched as the bartenders would serve the regulars but do their best to ignore me sitting at the bar. At one point the older guy that was \"bar tending\" literally had his back turned to me as he carried on a conversation. I thought alright at least when he turns around he will be forced to acknowledge me, nope he just kept on pretending like I wasn't there. That was enough for me and I left. I was really hoping this was an episode of bar rescue just so people could  see how ridiculous this place was, but no such luck.  I get it you just want to serve and cater to your regulars, no problem I won't be back."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich with baked beans, 1/2 a cob of corn and a qtr of watermelon fresh of the grill...yum! And for just $10 cash!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place.  It feels like an authentic Irish pub - the only thing that's missing is a turf fire and a dog.  The menu is small and limited but the food is consistently good.  I love the traditional Irish music on Saturday afternoon.  The shepherd's pie is quite good and filling.  The other night they had a chicken and fennel soup that was quite yummy.  The downside is that this pub can be loud and, since the place is tiny, many times there are no seats at the bar or tables on busy nights."}
{"text":"A friend once told me she thought Riley's Pour House was one of the most underrated places in Pittsburgh and since then, I've been dying to stop in. I finally made it here and I am quite impressed by the food!  I ordered the fish and chips and it was outstanding. Fish was moist and the batter was perfectly crispy, not at all overly greasy. The hubby got the Reuben and I love that they serve a whole half a pickle, not a spear like you'd find at other restaurants. Although the dishes weren't fancy, the quality of the ingredients was really what stood out.   We were here on a nice night so they had the outdoor space open. To my surprise, the outdoor space was dog-friendly! The place was packed on a Friday night so it was nice to have the option of going outside. Otherwise, we wouldn't have been able to get a table as the inside seemed quite small.   Great place for food and brews! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great neighborhood bar, I especially love when they have live music. I really like the soup... Good pub food all around. It can get crowded especially around holidays, but the new garden outside has helped during warmer months. Definitely a local place to check out."}
{"text":"It's an extension of your own home.  The folks that work there are always welcoming with a smile, even John the bartender.  I love the LIVE music daily...you never know when someone will start playing the piano or guitar or just start singing.  In Irish fashion there's plenty of stories and jokes being shared.  Everything that comes out of the kitchen is delicious and have tried just about all of it.  A must try, again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Got there at 10:50 waited 10 minutes to even be acknowledged then told in no uncertain terms \"kitchen closed\". Well if we didn't have to WAIT 10 minutes it would be open. Waitress was a complete B with terrible attitude.  Hard to believe that they have been in business 30 years."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Friendly but not so attentive service, but not horrible. Had wings and the Shepherds pie. Wings were undercooked and very chewy. Shepherd's pie was just ok. Not what is expect from authentic Irish but not disgusting. Ok place could be a lot better. Live music was also just ok..."}
{"text":"Packed on a Friday night! The outdoor section was okay during the winter, still pretty warm... a little empty and music was unnecessarily loud. The demographic seemed to be mostly 40s and up. Only about 15-20 young adults there that night. Reasonably priced drink and food."}
{"text":"So affordable and the apps are delicious! The atmosphere is FANTASTIC! The owner is so kind and the staff is attentive. I go here all the time and can't say enough good things about it! Their wings are my favorite thing to order! Def recommend :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful spot for brunch!  The food is delicious and the portions are huge! Service was good and our waitress was very nice and made sure we were taken care of. The best part is they have bloody Mary's and mimosas for $2. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Always seems to be great live music, a small pub, great atomesphere, delicious food, and the genuine Irish feel you'd want in a pub."}
{"text":"had dinner with a co-worker here Tuesday 1/17/17 and had a good time....had there T-bone Tuesday dinner and it was excellent !.... the svc. was good and professional......they had a couple doing lite jazz and that was enjoyable......this place looks like it prob. rocks on the weekends.....next time I get to town I will def. return"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight...great place. Live music (pianist and trumpet player) and the reuben was hands down the best in Pittsburgh. Sweet potato fries were pretty decent also. I only rated it as 4 stars because our waitress was a little inattentive at times. Other than that, overall good experience. Prices were quite fair for the quality and amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Just looking at these pictures makes me home sick. I love this place. I was a regular here many years ago. It has changed hands through the years - but the latest owners have much to be proud of.  Outstanding Irish music, food and drinks. The Ruben Roll is worth the 600 mile road trip. LOL. When I am in Pittsburgh, I try to stop in."}
{"text":"As far as the Irish pubs in the Pittsburgh area go Riley's is a pretty solid choice. Their fish sandwich is bangin' and the prices are all really reasonable. They recently did a remodel of the outdoor area and I'm not sure I'm a huge fan, but I'm willing to give it a chance. The service can also be spotty but would you really want anything else from an Irish bar? ;) Check it out for yourself - it's a great Carnegie staple!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Best Buffalo wings @$4 a throw! Best Reuben sandwich in the world! My wife Angie I split it and it's plenty."}
{"text":"I was only at Riley's very briefly but had a good time! We stopped in for a beer before heading to an event and sat on the patio. The bartender was very friendly and the beer was reasonably priced. They were setting up for a film screening under their pavilion and had plenty of outdoor space. If I'm back in Carnegie, I would definitely stop back in for dinner some night!"}
{"text":"Riley's is a great place to get a nice relaxed meal or have a more lively evening with friends and family. Live music I believe every day of the week from really great artists, and very good food! The fries are amazing and come in huge portions. I usually get a half order of the chili fries and it is enough for 4 people. Fish and Chips, Reuben, and the burger are also highly recommended (although I'm sure all of the food is tasty!). Also, they've got a great selection of beer to go with your meal!   Saturday breakfast is also really awesome. Very relaxed, smooth piano tunes playing in the back, and a small menu to make your decision easy. I stick with alternating between the Irish Breakfast and the omelette, but I have tried the pancakes and they are huge, fluffy, and tasty as well. Also, you can get a mimosa and bloody mary for only $2, which is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great spot for some Irish food and beer.  Gets pretty crowded so sometimes you have to wait."}
{"text":"REALLY crappy service. We came in and sat at the bar around 7pm. Lots of servers and bartenders, but after 15 minutes they still hadn't said a word to us. The old bartender saw me several times, but never came over. When he finally came over he had a casual conversation with another worker for a few minutes behind the bar and then walked away again. Finally we left and went to Bakn down the street which was amazing.  One star because I got to eat good food eventually, just not here."}
{"text":"Brief review because I just went there for some drinks.    Great atmosphere.    There was a gent playing the piano - who sounded awesome.   I am very interested in their breakfast.   I will definitely go there again and update my review."}
{"text":"The establishment is quite small, unless you go sit in the tent in the back. Walking to the tent is like walking into Noah's Ark at Kennywood..... Kinda creepy, but eventually you get there. It was packed when we went in, which is always a good thing. We ordered food and it seemed to take a really long time to come out, but it was good, so it was worth it. Drinks weren't expensive, which is nice. Bartenders are friendly enough. Live entertainment is always a plus, but it was kind of awful at the same time. Not sure if we will be back, but not ruling it out!"}
{"text":"You. Guys trust me right.  Great bar food and wings.  The Reuben is he best in Pghv not classiest place but clients love the home Pittsburgh feel"}
{"text":"Best Ruben in Pittsburgh!! Such a beautiful pub. Nothing better than a Irish pub!! Great place to go and have a good time. The food is awesome!! Try the sweet potato fries too. Delicious!"}
{"text":"People from the North Hills, there is a very chill spot to chill in Carnegie and that is Riley's Pour House. Went here on a Saturday night to scout out the area since I've been hearing about how \"up-and-coming\" it is, and found three places with live bodies in them after 8pm; Riley's, 131, and the liquor store. So, even though Bacon recently opened, I'd say if you want a quiet town this is still the place to be.  The Parmesan wings were standard. BF ordered a hamburger that he said, \"Hit the spot.\" And I got a Reuben which is why this review got an extra star. They have Angry Orchard, which is great for a non-beer drinker like me. The outside seating area had live music. The crowd was a bit older, but they knew how to hit the dance \"ground\". Our server was really pleasant and worked her bum off moving from table to table. We paid exactly the right amount for a nice dinner out, drinks, and live music. Thanks, Riley's!"}
{"text":"Great place. Would have given it four stars were it not for the awful \"authentic\" Irish music, replete with bagpipes, on a Friday night. Sign on the door said the music was 8-12, yet it's 12:33 as I type and they're still playing.  Can't anyone have a drink in peace anymore?"}
{"text":"This place is brilliant! Great atmosphere and the owners understand Irish hospitality. Maybe the best corned beef in the city. Yum!!  Not to be missed"}
{"text":"I have been to Riley's twice for lunch. On my first visit I had the best broccoli cheese soup I have ever had in my life! I followed this up with Rueben rolls (in egg roll wrappers) which were also good. The second time, I tried the Shepherd's pie, but I was not a fan. Riley's has a really nice outdoor space that is heated in the winter and lots of music. I need to come over here in the evening and enjoy these aspects."}
{"text":"We went for the fish as Riley's is in the final 4 of the Pittsburgh Fish Fry brackets.   Sadly, I was very disappointed in the food and I'm amazed they are even in the running for best fish in town.   The lunch was ordinary, over-breaded fish, ordinary big fries (that were warm, not hot) and a fairly small draft selection.  I will say, the gravy for the fries was killer- maybe among the top 10 I've had but that wasn't enough to salvage the lunch.  Service was pretty slow for a lunch time.   Riley's looks like a great neighborhood pub - I'd probably stop back in for a beer when I'm in town but will skip the food."}
{"text":"Consistently good food. Great owners. There's really nothing quite like Riley's. I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place. The drinks and food are always spot on. The waitresses are super relatable and sweet. I have no complaints whatsoever. My boyfriend and i prefer to get the mussels in white wine sauce every time we come because they are just OUT OF THIS WORLD delicious. On top of all that, the live music is always a treat & the musicians always make it a point to interact with the audience & most songs are (appropriately)Irish drinking songs. If you're looking for a new place to try or just a little dive to check out, THIS will be your new favorite. It's a blast."}
{"text":"Totally enjoy this lil neighborhood pub....ESPECIALLY for breakfast Saturday mornings. Such a great atmosphere, delicious, inexpensive food and drink. Can't beat the $2 mimosas and bloody Mary's til noon! New management awesome, girls at bear great fun and attentive on Saturdays. Can't say the same about the afternoon bartender. Have had their burgers (yum) and Reuben's (wow!!). Will definitely be back to this lil place!"}
{"text":"I had fish and chips and they were fantastic. Wait staff was friendly and attentive to the outsider. Also tried the provolone sticks as well and they were also very good. If you're in the area stop by this little place and don't mind the piano player, he's just having a good time."}
{"text":"I am pleasantly surprised by the new Pour House. The walls aren't sticky anymore, tables aren't old and don't rock, and everything has a refreshing paint job. The place looks amazing, and with no more smoking, smells good too. As for the food they still have the traditional stuff, and of course the grilled cheese is still yummy (if you get it, ask for all three cheeses). One disappointment is that they stopped selling potato pancakes which was the reason I used to go to the old Pour House, but the new menu items are refreshing. I happened to be there when they were serving a shrimp and cucumber gazpacho, and it was excellent.  Also, it seemed like they added some local beer to the taps. When I was there, they had Rooney Beer and Duquesne Pilsner on tap, along with all the traditional Irish beers. One better change is the serving staff. Gone are the surely guys who looked at you funny when you asked for a napkin; in there place are young, smiling girls. The changes to the Pour House definitely make this place a must-go, but I still miss the potato pancakes. :("}
{"text":"I have stopped in for dinner two times. The food is delicious an very reasonably priced.  The first time we went I had a steak which was delicious and cooked exactly as I asked. My wife got colcannon and ruben egg rolls. Both of us left stuffed and brought left over home with us.  The second time we went I had the fried cod and my wife once again got the ruben egg rolls which were once again delicious.  The service can be a little slow so don't go there if you are in a rush but all the staff is very friendly and they do come and check on you to make sure everything is OK.  Sadly, they don't have a lot of vegetarian options, and I am now a vegetarian so our visits may not be as frequent as they would be if I still ate meat unless I see some more vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Riley's Pour House before yesterday. Eric suggested that we check it out. Not too shabby at all.  The place itself is small, but cozy. They have a small stage up front, where they advertise all sorts of live music. (Made a mental note to check out an Irish music night). They also have an outside patio out back, if dining al fresco is what you are looking for.  The service was meh. I think this was due to there only being two servers for the entire place. One was also the bartender, however it wasn't terrible and they managed.  I ordered the fish and chip dinner & Eric got the fish sandwich. Talk about HUGE portions. My meal started with a choice of salad, coleslaw, or fruit. I opted for the coleslaw. It was good, but a little heavy on the celery seed, so I gave the rest to Eric. The fish and chip itself was massive, but so so yummy!!! Nice thick batter dipped fish with yummy steak fries. They had it right with Heinz vinegar on the table. I was in heaven.  As far as beer options, don't think you're going to get your craft beer of choice. They do represent their Irish heritage by having Smithwicks, Guinness, & Harp all on tap. Of course all the Pgh regulars are there too.   This is definitely a place where I will visit again.  Most likely on a live music night, and I'll have the corned beef b/c it smelled breathtaking! :)"}
{"text":"I think we found a place who has better Rubens then Big Jim's. And that's saying something."}
{"text":"Best pub south of Pittsburgh. By far. Food is always great and the service has been spectacular. It's just the best kind of place. You'll see what I mean when you go there. Friendly, casual, great menu, everything you want in a neighborhood pub."}
{"text":"Great spot...good bar food AWESOME service. Little gem Carnegie with outside space and live music"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a traditional Irish pub in the city of Pittsburgh look no further. Riley's has real Irish food, real Irish drinks, and real Irish atmosphere. Plus the back deck is nice. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Been going here practically my entire life with my family.  As others have said, owners have changed a few times.  While we've always enjoyed coming here over the years but the current owners should be called out for making it extra special.  Expanded the outdoor dining area and just overall have made great improvements while keeping everything in line with the history and spirit of what the Pour House is....a great local pub with good food, great music and friendly and fun customers and staff."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. For brunch it was casual and a great price. We actually weren't going to come to this place because we didn't know about it but a boutique shop owner suggested it to us and told us the mimosas were $2 and a cheap breakfast. We were definitely not disappointed by the kind service, unique atmosphere and great food. The silverware was plastic, adding to it being pretty causal. There were individuals who came in from a run and everyone from dresses to short. Nothing fancy, but if you're looking for a good, cheap breakfast, this is the place to come."}
{"text":"Heard good things so we ordered takeout... The food was very disappointing, borderline gross. Wings were way overcooked with the BBQ sauce sporadically squirted on afterwards, the fish sandwich was rubbery, bland, and also overcooked, and the pub fries that just had some gravy on top cost $8. The gravy was good tho, so there's that. Might try again, but probably not."}
{"text":"Had a little time to kill so I stopped into Riley's or a Murphy's Stout while in route to my girlfriend place.  I've been a big fan of this little Irish inspired pub for quite some time and wish it was located closer to my house.    I usually stop in for a bite before attending a performance at the Off The Wall Theater just up the road; then drinks after the show. On weekend evenings you'll most likely find someone  on the small stage in the front playing guitar and singing Irish songs.   I've had the Pour House O'Burger,  the Reuben, the cod and the Shepherds pie. Everything has always been delicious and I'd recommend any one of these dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks. Saturday breakfast is a great deal and $2 Mimosa or Bloody Mary with breakfast purchase! The side patio is awesome in the summer! Need to check this place out."}
{"text":"Great little pub. I had a great Reuben. My wife had the fish and chips. The fish breading was a little too thick, and but the fish itself was great. This place has great atmosphere, huge portions, fair prices, and they pour a solid pint. What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I understand that this Riley's Pour House is under new management. That new manager is doing an AMAZING job! I was thrilled with the food, service, cleanliness, specials, cold beers. It doesn't get much better for a little spot to grab drinks and food for lunch, happy hour, or even dinner.   I try to stop in once a week for a delicious signature salad or ice cold beer.   I also always see the owner making improvements to the property. Every time I am in there he is doing cleaning, repairs or providing friendly service."}
{"text":"Friendly neighborhood place. The food is good, the atmosphere is fun and the prices are reasonable. They have an outdoor area with live music, which seems to draw a decent amount of people. When it's cold outside they have a tent up with heaters, so the space is still enjoyable."}
{"text":"If I could create my own pub, it would be exactly like the Pour House. The only disappointing thing is that it's 17 miles from my house and I can't go there every day. I love this place."}
{"text":"After enjoying a mead tasting across the street at Apis, my friends and I were hungry and had the choice between \"the Italian place or the Irish place\". I'm glad we picked the Irish place! We had a blast!   We were there for open mic night and I have to say it had some of the best talent I've ever heard at an open mic night! We sat down at a table and it took a few minutes to get service on the busy night but when we were greeted it was pleasant and we ordered off the menu, which had plenty of bar food options and Irish choices.   My friends got the cod cake sandwich, grilled cheese, fish and chips, and the wings. I had the potato skins and the cock a leekie soup, which was like a chicken and barley soup. Everyone had a great meal.   We had a lot of fun at the bar and it really reminded me of a laid back bar you would find in Ireland. It wasn't kitschy but still had the Irish feel. I would like to return for another open mic night."}
{"text":"Beautiful outdoor patio.  Very enjoyable live music. One of the best Reubens I've ever had. Reasonably priced drinks.  I look forward to my next visit here."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed at all of the changes. I LOVED the way the Pour House was - especially the authentic Irish menu which has now been stripped down. I miss the colcannon and the Guinness Stew - which I could get as a combo plate. This was one of my favoirte places in Pittsburgh and now - it's just another Claddagh."}
{"text":"Great little Irish bar that makes you feel at home.  They have all the Irish beer favorites (Guinness, etc) and a very basic bar food menu.  I wish they had more Irish specific dishes and curries but they do well with what they have.  The restaurant is also great for kids.  My son loves their chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Wow...The Pour House. A Carnegie staple for decades. Years ago I worked in an office directly across the street and would order lunch almost daily. It's changed over the years but not much and for the better. They have great drink specials with a decent crowd of people who are always friendly even if you're not a regular. I suggest trying one of their Bloodies. So good you guys."}
{"text":"This place is unsanitary, we found black mold on the rims of the ketchup bottles which they have been pouring ketchup into for 10 Years without ever changing.  Aside from the disgusting conditions the food is all frozen crap.  Avoid this horrible place at all costs."}
{"text":"The best pub around! The inside is so cool looking and gives such a cozy vibe. The outdoor area is fantastic, even in winter. Plenty of TVs, live music, delicious food and an awesome brunch special ($2 mimosas and bloody Mary's). A must check out!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I have gone to the pour house! I loved it and had a blast with my friends during Thanksgiving weekend! The bar was lively with a mixed crowd of all ages and had great drink prices. I ordered a shot and two beers for only $11! Can't beat it. The bartenders were very friendly and helped us decide on a delicious shot choice. We didn't have food when we were here, but we plan on being back to try some in the future for sure! We had a great time."}
