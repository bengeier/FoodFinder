{"text":"New restaurant in the neighborhood that is in the old Jug and Barrel. Great Sangria, great atmosphere (newly opened, but decor is great), and the menu has great potential. They are still tweaking the menu a bit, but Mike one of the owners really wants to know how you felt about the experience. He accommodated us great and welcomed any and all input we had. We will definitely be visiting this place again and going through some of the other tapas available. The paella was good along with several other tapas and sangria, the bill was inexpensive."}
{"text":"I would've given 5 stars but when a bunch of us go together and order many drinks and tapas, the price is a bit high (though it is reasonable). I've been to Spain and the tapas here are authentic, delicious, and reasonably priced. Unfortunately, those of us on this side of the freeway are used to cheap chains and cheaper dinner prices, so many reviewers have remarked about the prices being too high. This is not necessarily a dinner place, though entrees are offered. Tapas are meant to be PLURAL, so they are ordered throughout the evening, not necessarily all at the same time, so ONE tapas is not enough, even for one person,  because more than one tapas would be ordered for sharing with the group. 
Start with two per person and drinks. Bread is served so we can mop up the garlicky sauces. Fresh potato chips (made there) are provided with many of the tapas.
I wish they offered the little potato fingerlings (or slices of potatoes which have been braised) with aioli which are found all over Spain.
The service is excellent (please don't downgrade service for any restaurant in the summer in Phoenix. Without the crowds of tourists and sunbirds, there is not the clientele in local restaurants to merit all servers being on duty every night--the little mom and pop restaurants like this one would soon be out of business). Since the new manager was hired, the place is much more efficient and service is now excellent--go on weeknights if you're worried about other reviews. Be sure to go on Saturday for the flamenco dancer and music. Lovely ambience as well. Great sangria (both white and red). Nice selection of inexpensive wines as well."}
{"text":"We were so excited to visit this restaurant after reading a review in Phx magazine.  WHAT a mistake!   First impression ...the atmosphere was comfortable and that is where our experience stopped short.  We questioned the menu (not the same except for a few items)  and then  learned that the review we read was \"old\"  (?) and that there were new owners made me wonder why the old owners left when they were so loved by the reviewer we had trusted.

  My wine pour was extremely small but the price was not.  My appetizer was extremely small but the price was not.   There was major confusion when asking for substitutes (veg's instead of rice). Had a friend join us and had to ask 3 times for a new place setting.  Had to ask 2 times to check on her meal.  Server was seemed overwhelmed by 4 tables and also seemed put off that I asked about place setting and the time it took to get the orders.

On to the food, main course was served on desert/appetizer plates (looked so unprofessional).  My chorizo stuffed pork loin (house specialty), came to me as a  dry, over cooked (barely able to cut) small pork chop, that was stuffed with approx 1tsp of some sort of sausage mixture.  My companions dishes left them just as wanting ...3 garlic shrimp, 2 tables spoons of rice for $15.00 that took over 25 mins when there were only 4 tables occupied in the restaurant.  The menu seemed so promising and maybe all of our picks were off , but unfortunately I am BIG on first impressions and I will continue my search for Spanish cuisine"}
{"text":"This breaks my heart. I loved Jug N Barrel that sat in this location, so I had high hopes for Sabor. There isn't a tapas joint in this hood and I was looking forward to having a old haunt open back up, even if it was a completely new business.

Unfortunately, Sabor thinks WAY too highly of itself. I know it's on the cusp of the Arrowhead area, but the prices in Sabor would make you think you were somewhere much more exclusive. Not that I would have been bothered by that had the food not been so boring. The portions were barely enough for one person and this is supposed to be a tapas bar. You're supposed to share. No problem, pick several items on the menu and you'll be fine. Just be prepared to be in the $50+ (much likely more) range without purchasing drinks. The real issue is that food was so bland that I couldn't swallow a bite without shaking my head in disgust. The spanish rice that came with our filet was flavorless. The filet being the most expensive item on the tapas menu was mediocre but again, served in small portions.
The wine menu is acceptable but you're not going to find any deals or anything that you couldn't drink at a dozen other restaurants nearby. In all fairness, I haven't tried any of their sangria. If I can swallow my pride and return to Sabor, I'll have to rectify that.
Our server was very nice if a bit too sales oriented. Granted, we were 1 of 2 tables in service that afternoon, so I'm thinking Sabor won't be around too much longer.
Knock the prices down 30%, spice up the menu and it might have a chance."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a Tapas bar that opened in Glendale!  They serve paella!  But I had a bad feeling about the restaurant when I saw a harsh review on Urbanspoon.  I went on a Saturday night, and man was the reviewer spot-on.  The food is pretty good, but the service is atrocious.  I'm hoping that with a little more time, they'll work out the service kinks and become a better restaurant.  I really want Sabor to succeed."}
{"text":"I am going to have to give it 3/5 stars. Decent atmosphere, good location,  however wasn't a fan of the music and the bar was very small. Food on the menu tasted great. But it sure would have been nice to know what I was ordering. Majority  of it I couldn't pronounce let alone understand. Oh did I mention the food was Delicious?!"}
{"text":"On a scale of 1-10 of my knowledge of topas restuarants I would  grade myself a 3.75 of 10.. lol ... But, I can say that after visiting Sabor in Glendale I was able to hit my mark and have improved to 6.5.... 
The atomosphere is great, warm feeling inside like everyone is thier for the same reason - a great experience.  I started off with the \"croquetes\" and a nice glass of  Albrino . The croquetes were warm, firm, slightly hot and delightful- yes delightful. I took the next step and ordered off the drink list and had one of the  Signature cocktails the \"guapo mojini\"  -basic mojito w a twist they use VEEV made from acai berrys.. nice drink.  My next venture lead me to the Raxo - Tenderloin w/ potatoes.  That was such a great dish.  My favorite.  The next step - time to try the signature dish.  I was told my trip would not be complete w/out diving into the \"Paella\"-  I got the assorted meats paella - I did not like the chicken on the bone....But the combination of rice, beef, pork and spices was a true experience.  

I ended the night with a slice of heaven I call Tequila.. With a snifter of Sol de Mexico Anejo... wow that was great.  

I think the place has some good MOJO going on and will only get better and get the Detail to perfection. A very friendly & cozy lounge. Thank you for a great experience and the food made me appreciate what I did not know.  Looking forward to my next visit and watching this Sabor grow.  Heard they will have live acts and DJ's after dinner ..."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this new place as it had been vacant since Jug and Barrel went out of business.  I've been to Spain before and remember not loving the food but I decided to check it out anyway.  The ambience is cool and the sangria, both red and white, are delicious.  But we were not happy with our food and our waitress was in slow motion.  On the night we went they had flamenco dancers and an awesome Spanish guitarist and that was very entertaining.  We ordered a few different tapas, the garlic chicken, empanadas, and another beef one that I forget what is was called.  The garlic chicken sounded delicious but I was thoroughly disappointed when I saw it.  It was dark meat drumsticks that looked undercooked and left a horrible aftertaste in my mouth.  I only had like two bites and was freaked out by it.  I should have complained but I didn't feel like dealing because we were still having a good time.  The chicken empanadas were pretty good, I would recommend.  The beef was tough and chewy.  The potato chips that come with the tapas are really tasty, I ate most of those since I didn't like the food.  I recommend for drinks on the patio but not for dinner."}
