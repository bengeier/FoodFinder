{"text":"Rosie's is a cute little cafe on Avenue that offers gluten-free and vegan dishes. My sister and I decided to check it out on a Saturday morning, I got a green smoothie and she got a tea, and we got a cookie and brownie to share. They were okay, but we felt like there was something missing. The service was alright too, but she did seem a little short with us or impatient, which was interesting to me because there was no one else there at the time. At any rate, maybe I would try again if I was in the area, but otherwise, probably wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Rosie's Eatery is the latest gluten free and vegan caf√© to open up in Toronto.  This cute little eatery is owned and run by Rose Diker, a Torontonian who's been baking delicious treats since the age of 7.  During her years in college, Rose experimented with her baking and came up with a variety of baked goods that were wholesome and healthy.  Today, she showcases her guilt free, gluten fee and vegan treats at her eatery so that everyone can indulge without the guilt.

The menu consists of customizable oatmeal and yogurt (gluten free oats/non-dairy yogurt), salads, soups, smoothies, baked goods and raw treats.

I tried the coconut yogurt with berries, flax, hemp and seeds.  This was my first time trying non-dairy coconut yogurt and it definitely tastes very different than cow's milk yogurt.  It was lighter in texture with minimal flavour, but it was still very good and a great alternative for those who don't eat dairy. 

The Raw Bites at Rosie's are REALLY good and she has a nice variety of flavours to choose from: Cookie Dough, Coconut, Seed, Franklin or Chocolate Chip Brownie.

Her cookies are also quite magical.  All of them were really tasty and Rose does an excellent job in not making baked goods that taste dry or have the texture of cardboard.  Everything is either chewy, gooey or moist; making you forget that you're eating a vegan and gluten-free treat!

Rosie's is a great addition to the vegan and gluten-free eateries in Toronto. Although I am not vegan or gluten-free, I appreciate places like this that show us that eating vegan is not boring at all. Rosie's creations are absolutely delicious and some of the baked goods taste much better than the sugary buttery stuff you find at most cafes in the city. Make sure to drop by if you're in the area!

Rosie's eatery is located at 1726 avenue road and is Hours
Monday: 9am - 4pm

Our food also wasn't very pretty like the photos I saw on Instagram so I didn't bother putting it on my food page but here it is below. It was very yummy but that's all I really have to say. The oats were underwhelming. Could have made that myself."}
