{"text":"I visited this place for the first time since they have been open and will not be coming back very poor service..and the food was not that good..the woman behind the counter that took my order was talking to another person she knew the whole time while ringing up my order..which first of all I found to be plain rude..and she never gave me my drink up front which they usually give you while you wait for your order at other restaurants even fast food places..I had to ask them for my drink it looked like they forgot about it..and my one order took forever if this place does not last long at Fiesta mall it will most likely be because of poor service..since customer service is everything in a buisness it should be..I think I will stick to my usual well known fast food fish place Pete's Fish and Chips better prices and at least a little more better service which has been around forever in Mesa."}
{"text":"I think the food is good the kids that are working there are too young to care about making this the place stand out other than it's all African American run business. I maybe wrong about that too. I hope they can get themselves together and this business stays. I ordered the catfish with fries and red beans and rice with husspuppies. The fish and the fries were fine. The beans, rice & the husspuppies were uncooked. Turn it around folks your going to miss out on a lot of profits and acclaim if you don't step up your game.. I would change the staff unfortunately they are not helping this business at all."}
{"text":"If Catfish is what you're craving and you're in Mesa this place will do the trick! Charlie D's is the new restaurant that replaced the long time standing Chick-Fil-A at the Fiesta Mall so it will be easy to find. I got the lunch special which included catfish, and 2 sides for $6.99. I choose the seasoned fries and coleslaw for my sides. The fries were cold and tragic, the slaw was good but a little over dressed. My sister got the same combo but had potato salad and beans for her sides, they were okay. The service was less than desirable, I witnessed the lady that took the orders make 3 mistakes within a 20 minute period (wrong drinks twice, and wrong side orders).  Hopefully, they will work out the kinks soon because it's hard to keep repeat customers if the service sucks."}
{"text":"I'll start with would I go there again? No. The fish was almost OK, the texture was off and it wasn't crispy.  Something kinda smushy under the cornmeal.  The mac and cheese was terrible, pasty, sticky pasteurized cheese food mess.   Disappointing even for fast food."}
{"text":"I thought the catfish was good, so did my two year old grandson.   He was scarfing up every piece I gave him! The green beans were well cooked, Southern style with a little garlicky kick to them.  The potato salad was a bit too mayonnaise-y for my taste and needed some salt and pepper but otherwise ok.  I would go back again.  The service wasn't real welcoming and friendly like some places but they might warm up if they see me back again.  They say they have \"Fried Chicken\" but I only see Chicken Tenders on the menu.

There is a 50 cent charge to use your credit card."}
{"text":"WOULD GIVE 0 STAR.

The lady taking the order was clearly racist. I ordered the chicken and was planning on ordering more food but she abruptly cut me off for no apparent reason. The wait time for food was ~15 minutes - and mind you I order chicken tenders & fries, how long does it take to cook that. In my time waiting I witnessed her tell a few other individuals who came to order about the lunch special- which was never mentioned to me?

15 minutes later I get my food (which I got to go) and she asks me if I wanted hot sauce? OF COURSE I do... get to my car and I literally see one hot sauce... 1! Get back to my work where I then find out I was also given the wrong food? Literally I open my box expecting to see chicken tenders and fries and INSTEAD it's chopped fish, hushpuppies (burnt to a crisp), potato salad and green beans (from a can, microwaved). Apparently I got someone else's order, which is funny since I was the only person in line for about 10 minutes before another group of people came."}
