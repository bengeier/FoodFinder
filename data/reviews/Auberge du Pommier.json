{"text":"beautiful decor and location! Food is creative and tasty great place for a date if you want to make an impression."}
{"text":"Service & Atmosphere - our group of 3 went for the tasting menus as we wanted to try more of the food as this was our first time to this restaurant. The waiter and kitchen were extremely accommodating as one individual of our group was celiac (gluten-free) and the other being pescetarian (vegetarian + fish). They were able to swap items in and out of the tasting menu to accommodate what they desired and needed. They even served gluten-free bread for the one member of the party and reassured her that each dish was gluten-free. The décor was quite nice and gives you a feel that you're in a remote cottage somewhere. They even had a fireplace burning near the front of the restaurant which \"scented\" all our coats in the coat room also located at the front... for better or for worse. 

Food - I found to the food to be hit and miss. For some of the items in tasting menu, I found it to be a bit bland and required more seasoning. A good example would be the \"Pomme de Terre\" - while the lobster was very well cooked, there was a lack of cream and seasoning which made the potatoes dry and tasteless. However, the dish that stood out for me and that was the cod, mussel and shrimp dumpling in a consommé (dish may change with the season). The fish was perfectly cooked and all the items on the plate were propped up with carrots to prevent them from getting soggy in the consommé - very well thought out and well executed dish. As they were in season, we had white truffle added to some of our dishes. They were fragrant and added another dimension to the dish. Not many restaurants in Toronto offer white truffles during the holiday season, so this was a very nice addition. I think the desserts are an area of opportunity for the restaurant. The donuts that came with the tasting menu were good, but were not too sophisticated or inspired. I also got the soufflé which was a tad undercooked.  

Price - as with any fine dining restaurant, prepare your wallet. We went a little overboard with the wine and white truffles, so that shouldn't be a representation of a normal dinner at Auberge. If you are a little more cost conservative, wait for winter/summerlicious to try out the restaurant's offerings.

{"text":"Authentic cuisine with new/appetite uplift elements. Thoughtful server who is caring about my lactose intolerant issue. The same server even understands the culture and appetite of different culture which makes customers feel homey."}
{"text":"I love this place. Pricey but nice. Food is always top notch and the service has always been friendly. Quiet and classic and not unnecessarily pretentious like some places. The bread is very crispy crispy (inside joke)!"}
{"text":"A good place for a romantic date or a special occasion. Service is great. The food is delicious - we had the steak tartare, foie gras, and the rib eye. A sophisticated, high-end Oliver & Bonaci restaurant that is worth the price."}
{"text":"Really great, as always!

I have been going to Auberge du Pommier, now and then, pretty much since it opened.  I most-recently ate there a week ago, or so.  Service was...well...as always...about as good as it gets.  

There were four of us in our group, and we managed to get out of there under $800, which was refreshing.  Our table had the chef's menu, with accommodation for my special diet.  (Thanks!!!)  The food was very good, and our table managed to sample many different dishes.  Our servers were knowledgeable, affable, and professional, while the sommelier was a delight!  

I have to say, I am soooo comfortable there.  I slip into the comfy seat, and can't fathom leaving.  If only everyday life were as good as a dinner service at Auberge du Pommier.  

I am so glad this restaurant is still around, and hope to return again and again."}
{"text":"Never fails to disappoint. Very accommodating for food requests. Waiters are knowledgable with very good appreciation if their menu and wine list. I have been at least 10 times and it is consistently top notch."}
{"text":"Like Mariko, I went to Auberge Du Pommier with a date for Summerlicious 2011.

In fact, perchance, I ordered the exact same choices. Petite Salade Jardinière, Tranche de Saumon and Financier Noisettes. The food was excellent, exploding with rich tastes and textures beyond what my uncultured palette could justly criticize. They also paired the meal with three glasses of beautiful white wine for $20

... and I normally dislike white wine.

The decor is beautiful. The chairs are extremely comfortable. The service is friendly. 

I'd wear some nicer clothing next time.

I don't know if I would splurge for a $45 entreé with any regularity, but It's a nice experience for next Summerlicious or next time you pick up that big sales bonus.

Then go out and get a burger, cause you're gonna be hungry - but you didn't come here to pig out, now did you?"}
{"text":"We went here for Summerlicious 2017 with another couple. This restaurant was really exquisite and the food was simply amazing. 

For the appetizer we had the terrine (foie gras), Tuna and Soup (strawberry and coconut. Everything tasted exceptional, however the Terrine was the pick of the table. It was extremely flavourful and I would definitely recommend to everyone. The (cold) soup was also really good. For our mains we had the Cornish Hen, Ravioli and Beef Tenderloin. The beef was medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. The meat was truly succulent. I enjoyed every bite of it. The Cornish hen had a pan seared exterior. It was the best Cornish Hen we've tasted. The Ravioli was not a hit for us. Finally, for dessert we had the assortment of cheese, creme brule, parfait and the Chocolat with ice cream. The cheese was decent enough but nothing to write home about, the ice-cream that accompanied the parfait and Chocolat were both really good. The service was definitely up there. We liked that, although it's a high-end restaurant, everyone seemed down to earth and were very friendly. The atmosphere was definitely delightful and you can tell this is a great place for a couple on a date. It is very romantic. There was a bit of background chatter which is always good and it's a great atmosphere for having conversation. Added plus for the excellent seats, which were quite comfortable. 

We definitely recommend this restaurant for Summerlicious (it's one of the best). And we will also be going back to check out their regular menu sometime to taste the true restaurant menu. The rating is not to say the restaurant was perfect but we enjoyed the food and the evening. Great French Cuisine and worth a revisit."}
{"text":"I tried Auberge Du Pommier for the first time for Winterlicious and the overall experience was incredible. I have no complaints because it was so outstanding! 
The food is delicious, the service is impeccable and the atmosphere is very romantic. I've never been made to feel like a lesser customer just because I wasn't paying for a full priced meal. Even the spread and bread they bring before the meal was incredible. Would definitely recommend. This is hands down my favourite French restaurant in the city. 
Auberge Du Pommier knows how to set the mood :)"}
{"text":"attended with my mom for winterlicious !! 

cannot say enough great things about this restaurant ! from the front desk to the server to the food and wine pairing it was all 5 star ! 

had the remoulade for app and sea bass and chocolate for dessert . all was insane and fantastic

my mom got the turin , steak and beigne also amazing the wine pairing was perfect and a great deal at 20$ perfect pairing ... i recommend 100%"}
{"text":"The have so many super nice wine. You can find the wine no matter on the front door or on the hall to washroom. The food is tasty even during the witerlicious.  I order the beef as main courser and it combine by two kind of beef and cook in different way. Both are supper awesome. The desert is must try on. Best lemon tart I ever have and chocolate is so smooth and doesn't over sweet at all. Love it"}
{"text":"We came here for my partners birthday lunch - we enjoyed what we saw on the menu and have always loved how beautiful it looked inside we thought we'd give it a try.

We were offered complimentary sourdough bread with butter which was very warm and fresh. We decided to start with their mushroom soup with truffle oil and it didn't disappoint, it was very fresh and filled with seasoning a good punch of tarragon. 

For mains we did Brandade Croustillant and Méli Mélo salad. Both were so light yet packed with so much flavour - the fogo island fritters were very light but with so much flavour. The same can be said about the salad. Overall, the service was exceptional! When I made the reservation I indicated it was a birthday and they came out with a surprise little dessert - a great way to end a fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"My wife and I froze to death on the table next to the door. Meanwhile we were told the empty table next to us was reserved for a party of 4 and because of that was not an option for us to switch over. 5 minutes later that same table was promptly seated by a couple (2 persons). We then asked again to be seated somewhere that wasn't  freezing, and was told nothing is available by the hostess.  We were given the compensation of hot water *roll eyes*

We stayed because we were hungry and our seating was already at 8pm. The food turned out ok. We approached the waitress again after the hostess about why she couldn't re-seat us, and was told that she never knew we were cold. She made up some excuses about why there were no seats, and pretty much blamed the whole situation on winterlicious. *roll eyes* 

Don't go when it's busy, because apparently with 3-4 groups waiting to be seated the hostess is overwhelmed and will give you sh*t service."}
{"text":"Best food we had in a while, best service we had in a while!  Our server Robert was exceptional.  He was there but not in your face.  He treated our two little girls like adults and they responded in kind.  They behaved well, as if they felt this was a place where you don't monkey around but sit nicely.
Back to the food.. Absolutely delicious.  Portions were just right.  So refreshing to eat delicious food at healthy portions."}
{"text":"I have been to Auberge du Pommier on several ocassions, and have loved the experience every time! Belonging to the Oliver and Bonacini Restaurants family (along with Canoe, Jump, and LUMA,  to name a few), this French restaurant is located just north of York Mills on Yonge Street. From the outside, the restaurant resembles a cozy little courtyard house complete with a garden, white picket fence, and a very charming cobblestone walkway. While it looks like a small on the outside, it is deceivingly spacious on the inside! The decor is simple and quaint with its neutral colour theme, fireplace, and stone walls. a romantic ambiance coupled with excellent food makes this the perfect date night spot!


After we get our coats checked, the hostess brings us to a nicely set up table and hands us menus that show an artistic interpretation of the Auberge du Pommier house on the cover. Inside, all the dishes are in French, with accompanying English descriptions.


Before even ordering, the waitor comes by with a tray of bread, some butter, and olives. I was famished so it was nice to have something to hold me over while we decided on what to order. The service is exceptional and not to mention very knowledgeable. In my opinion, there was not another thing they could've done service-wise to make the experience better than it was.


\"Hamachi Marine au Betterave\" ($21)- beet-cured hamachi, raisin glace, shiso bavarois, lime gelee 
Pardon my ignorance, but I was unaware that Hamachi was an ingredient that belonged to French cuisine! The hamachi was served raw at room temperature and paired with an assortment of garnishings. The frozen grape, lime gelee, and dollops of whipped cream was a refreshingly sweet compliment to the delicate pieces of fish.



\"Steak Tartare\" ($22) -handcut beef tenderloin, slightly spicy, classic garni, crouton
We mixed the raw quail egg into the tartare, and ate it with the plate of toasted croustinis that came with the appetizer. I don't order steak tartare often, but I usually find it to be too peppery. To my surprise this one at Auberge du Pommier was not at all peppery, and had a pleasant sweetness that is not often associated with beef. The only complaint here is the croustinis that were unpleasantly over-toasted.


\"Cassoulet de Canard\" - roasted ontario duck breast, fresh bean and bacon cassoulet, pistachio crumble, foie gras mousse, jus de cuisson ($45)
The Cassoulet de Canard was an impressively cooked dish. The duck breast was roasted to a medium rare perfection, while retaining flavour and juice. I particularly liked the pistachio crumble, it gave both the lamb and bean salad that extra texture and oomph!


\"Craquant de porcelet \"- crackling of suckling pig, confit de pork presse, sweet potato puree, rutabaga farci, jus de biere (42)
When the Craquant de Procelet first arrived, it reminded me of a miniature model of a city. There are two peices of pork, and distributed evenly around it are stumps of rutabaga that resemble city towers. Excuse my vivid imagination, but what I'm trying to get at is that the plate was very busy. I didn't know where to start eating! The best part of this plate was definitely the crackling of sucking pig. The meat was tender, the sking was crispy but not dry, and it had the perfect layer of fat. While conceptually it is the same as the roast pork you can find from Chiense BBQ shops, it was definitely less greasy, better cooked, and a quality cut of meat.


\"Parfait Chataigne\" ($11) -chestnut semifreddo, puffed wild rice, lemon meringue, marron glace, cassis caramel
We were quite full, but still insisted on trying a dessert. The Parfait Chataigne comes with two bite size bite size portions of semi-frozen chestnut custard, and accompanying garnishings. I thought the custard itself was pretty bland, but the crunchy candied walnut, puffed rice, and tiny bits of diced celery gave it some texture and extra flavour. Still, it wasn't something that really jumped out to my preferences.


Complimentary Macrons - Maple and Chococlate
If you don't feel like ordering dessert after your meal at Auberge, they offer these complimentary macarons with your bill as a sweet parting. Surpringly, I think I enjoyed these treats more than the Semifreddo. The ones shown here are Maple and Chocolate, but they also make Pistachio and Strawberry. When I asked the waiter if I could order some to go, he came back with a box of macrons and told me it was on the house. A nice little surprise to end an amazing meal."}
{"text":"We went here for winterlicious and it was a great experience. The foods are great and well prepared. I'll come back to try their regular menu!!"}
{"text":"This is review is long overdue.  I was here for summerlicious with friends.  The experience of making a reservation, being seated, service, and food was excellent!  The decor is romantic and is great for a nice dinner.  I would return to have their full priced menu."}
{"text":"Is there a better dining experience than this? I don't think so. A fine French restaurant with beautifully prepared and plated food. The waiters are attentive without being cloying. They are knowledgable about the dishes and wines and don't make you feel like a dummy when you enquire about either.  We went for summerlicious and loved the entire meal. Delicious wines. Fabulous desserts."}
{"text":"I went to Auberge du Pommier for my bridal shower and had a great experience - friendly staff, great atmosphere, and delicious food. I decided to go back for summerlicious 2016 and it was a completely different experience. Food was average - salad and dessert were OK, but coulette steak was very salty and had a lot of gristhle. But most importantly, MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR BILL - my waiter charged me dinner price when I was there for lunch, and made 2 other mistakes while they tried to fix it."}
{"text":"My family have dinner here for my birthday.   The food is great!  The beef is the best, it goes with any kind if red wine. The lamb is amazing."}
{"text":"Phenomenal place! My wife and I have been there several times and they continue to impress. The food is brilliant!
Only downside - it's expensive, but you totally get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Scrumptious French food in a lovely atmosphere, especially on their patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Had an excellent Winterlicious experience here before, but my recent Summerlicious experience was not up to par.

The waitress was friendly, and as we were a large group, we needed a bit more time to decide what to eat. After asking once if we were ready to order and needing a few more minutes, It took at least 10 more minutes for her to return(after I asked several bus boys to bring a waitress over to take my order no waitress was to be found, and I had to wait until she came out of the door to flag her down).

The olive salad had a very rich olive flavour, though the salad itself was a bit on the salty side.
The gazpacho was very refreshing, with little bits of tomato to chew on.
The terinne was okay, I prefer the creamy pork terrine from the last winterlicious.

We ordered a duck breast from the regular menu, it was chewy. 
From the summerlicious menu:
The sea bream itself was good, but the yellow split peas underneath were not very appetizing....they should have used quinoa, beans, mashed potatoes, or something else.
The Beef was very good, though it was still slightly chewy even though I ordered it medium and a little on the salty side. The cut was different than the one I received during Winterlicious(that one was melt in your mouth good).
Chicken was okay, nice crispy skin, though the inside could have been a bit more moist.

The custard of the mille-Feuille was a bit too thick, when I tried to spread it thinner my fork got stuck in the custard and the whole mille feuille moved on the plate.
I suspect the \"pastry\" part of it was phyllo dough and not puff pastry.
The chilled Melon soup was excellent though! The little slivers of mint were very refreshing, and the plating was very nice.
Someone in my party ordered the creme brulee from the regular menu. He said the hard caramel was too burnt so it was a bit bitter, and it was luke warm, like it was not freshly made.

Service:
Most of us ordered hot water, so our first cups were brought to the table from a tray.
Our refills however were poured at the table from a glass kettle that must have previously been used for coffee. Every time she added water to my cup, the water tasted like coffee, and I could see coffee grinds at the bottom of my cup.

Other Notes:
The after meal coffee was served with cold milk and cream, next time they should warm up the milk and cream so it wont affect the temperature of my coffee so much.
Food was a bit salty during this visit...

I would come back for Winterlicious to see if I was just unlucky this time, but I would have definitely been unhappy with what I received if I had paid regular price and not summerlicious (though the duck breast really wasn't very good).
Until we meet again!"}
{"text":"So I went to this restaurant for the 2015 summerlicious menu with my boyfriend and am sad to say we were greatly disappointed. The staff at the front desk was extremely polite and helpful where as our own server was terrible. 
Our seats were in the terrace which was beautiful at first, until the vicious mosquitoes came out to attack. The server walked passed our table twice knowing our cups of water were empty but didn't care to offer a refill. Overall this restaurant has too much hype around its name for no reason. Wouldn't return in the future because the service was sooooo slow."}
{"text":"What a fantastic restaurant for a special occasion. Just be prepared for a big bill! I loved the atmosphere here - it was dimly lit, and had a very romantic ambiance to it. 

What we ordered:

- Foie Gras & Confit: seared duck liver with duck confit, chestnuts, winter spice and Cumberland jus ($26).  The foie gras was perfectly seared and just melted in my mouth. Definitely one of those \"once-in-a-while\" starters since it's almost all fat. I didn't really feel the duck confit was necessary to this dish, but it was tasty.

- Steak Tartare - hand cut beef tenderloin, slightly spicy, with classic garni and crouton ($22). The portion of this was huge! It was the same size as an entree size of steak tartare I've had at another restaurant. It was also really delicious. Highly recommended.

- Rôti d'Agnea - sirloin of lamb and gigot braisé on parsnip purée, spaghetti squash, rosemary Yukon dumpling and jus de cuisso ($43). This was served medium rare and the lamb was quite tender. I preferred the lamb leg over the braised lamb shank (although my boyfriend preferred the shank). The gnocchi that came with this dish was actually my favourite part (too bad there were only 5 of them). Although this dish was nice, it didn't blow me away. I've had better lamb dishes.

- Porcelet de St-Canut  - roast piglet, caillette crêpe, braised belly, salsify and grain mustard jus ($39). We particularly enjoyed the crepe and the braised belly. Super tasty. The roast piglet was my least favourite, but it was still decent. I preferred this pork dish over the lamb.

- Galette Pomme et Frangipane - warm apple tart, almond and pâte sucrée with rhubarb confit and beurre noisette ice cream ($11). Although the dish tasted good, I didn't think it was anything special. My favourite part of this dish was the rhubarb confit and ice cream. The tart itself was okay, but I would've expected something better from Auberge. 

Overall, I enjoyed my experience here, but I preferred the starters more than the mains. Other things to keep in mind:
- the food is served very slowly (we were there for over 2 hours for a 3 course meal)
- fantastic service
- free underground parking"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and it was awesome!!

The food is excellent. The server was extremely attentive and recommended me and my mother appropriate dishes cratered to our liking. Great ambiance and great wine selection. 

Don't think you can be more french-y than this."}
{"text":"Auberge was a delightful but not exquisite dining experience. The dishes were beautifully presented and tasted great. Portions were small and I was hungry but the dishes didn't leave me that sense of wanting more after I've finished. 

Our server was good for the most part and suggested a wonderful bottle of wine to complement our meal. Overall, I would like to try this place again."}
{"text":"Service is amazing, and the ambience is great. They have an inside-patio at the back of the resto and you can eat there rain or shine.

Location is pretty bad; it's in the middle of nowhere. After you eat, you have to get on a car or go on the subway to go somewhere else for fun, because there's nothing around there. But if the food and service and ambience are great, this isn't a deal-breaker. 

The food was reallllly fresh!!! 

But I gotta say, the flavours weren't all that amazing......The salad appetizer was very fresh, but it was literally cut veggies, with barely any dressing. I usually don't like a lot of dressing on my salad, but there was barely any on that salad. I guess they wanted me to enjoy the bare freshness of the veg? 
My main was bitter (they charred the meat, which is nice; I don't mind a little bitterness from the char), BUT they coupled it with a bitter salad. Too much bitterness in one main...I don't know how those chefs thought that was a good idea. 
Dessert was good; I don't know if they make their own, but I got a torte and it was really good.

I know some people absolutely adore this place, and I can understand why; great service and amazing ambience and decor, and I'm sure they like the food the way it is. 
But personally for me, the food just wasn't that amazing. 

For the prices they charge, the food should be really really good. I want to give 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Good food, staffs check up on us every now and then and they didn't drop by right at the time I was about to have a bite.

Waitress was helpful and knowledgeable on how dishes are prepared.  Overall, very good experience.  

We got the snails for appetizer, tenderloin and lamb for mains.  Not the Winterlicious ones."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for the Winterlicious dinner menu. 

Let me start with the positives: 

The restaurant itself is very charming, like an old english home. The dining room we were in was nicely lit and felt very cozy. Also the noise level perfect. It was quiet enough to have a conversation without yelling and still loud enough that other patrons wouldn't be listening to you.

On to the service, which was excellent. The hostess, the wait staff, everyone was friendly and quite attentive. 

As for the negatives: 

I was not really satisfied with the food. For the appetizer I ordered a smoked sturgeon bean soup, which to me was bland, but not upsetting. My main course was a filet of beef which was maybe 4 ounces and charred to a black crisp. I had asked for medium and the inside of the filet was surprisingly cooked to medium, but the outside was completed charred. To be fair, after I cut off the char, it was quite good, but it also only left me with 3 ounces of editable meat. In retrospect I guess I should have sent it back, but I very seldom ever do. As for dessert I had a fried donut with apple sauce and it was delicious. 

In total we spent $260+ for 4 people with 1 drink/person, which for me is kind of an expensive dinner and my expectations were naturally set higher, but unfortunately were not met. I can't imagine how much the dinner would have cost had it not been winterlicious, and after this experience, I don't plan to find out.

Update: I have just learned that steak that is charred on the outside is \"Chicago style\" and apparently the way they do beef. Although its not my taste, i guess i cant fault them as much, so I upped my rating to 3."}
{"text":"Overall a very nice evening out. The service was amazing, the ambience was super romantic and the wine pairing was spot on. Thanks food was very good!"}
{"text":"Managed to get a reservation for summerlicious this year for the lunch menu. Restaurant decor and ambiance were top notch and made the experience all that much more enjoyable. From the outside of the restaurant till the moment you enter there is a very homey yet elegant feel. There is an underground and above ground parking however for lunch this is a paid parking. 
The summerlicious lunch menu was 3 courses for $28, 
For my meal I chose
Appetizer:
TERRINE
Chicken & Leek Terrine, Market Vegetables à la Grecque & Truffled Artichoke Emulsion
-Fine. Just fine. There really isn't much more I can say about this. There was nothing exceptional about the Terrine but I didn't exactly hate it either.
Entree:
POULET (local)
Grilled Chicken Supreme, 100km Foods Ratatouille, Parmesan K2Milling Polenta & Arugula
-I felt the chicken was a little underwhelming. In my opinion, it was very under flavored and under salted. It was however very tender and cooked well.
Dessert:
PANNA COTTA
Pineapple Panna Cotta, Coconut Streusel, Lime Meringue & Mango Gelée
-My favorite part of the meal was the panna cotta. Presentation was really good and it was very tasty. I feel like if it wasn't for this dessert, I wouldn't have enjoyed my experience at all since the rest of the food was mediocre at best.

For all the hype I'd heard about Auberge, I felt the taste of the food was somewhat underwhelming. Other than the dessert, I didn't really enjoy the rest of the meal. The portions are somewhat small but I feel they are adequate for a 3 course meal. If I perhaps went when summerlicious wasn't taking place, I may be a bit disappointed with the portion size. The service provided by the staff at the restaurant was probably one of the best experiences I had with restaurant servers. Overall though, the ambiance, decor and the service from the servers didn't make up for the food."}
{"text":"Auberge has been on my \"bucket-list\" of restaurants for some time.  I finally convinced a few friends to make the trek to North York for summerlicious.  While the service was excellent and the room lovely, the food was bland and disappointing.   I totally understand that during summerlicious high end restaurants are not always able to offer exactly the same kind of fare as they do on their regular menu when not quite as cost constrained - however - this meal did not make me want to go back again"}
{"text":"Came for summerlicious and it was delicious and service was on point. You know the restaurant is five stars if they manage to maintain the standard during the crazy summerlicious/winterlicious"}
{"text":"Dined on Feb 3.
Been there for dinner before.  This time, wanted to try their winterlicious menu.  Had Seafood Remoulade and Ontario Beef with wine pairing.  Food was excellent and consistent with their standard.  Service was professional and friendly.  Charming setting.  An enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Had the chef's tasting menu. The service was sub par for such a nice restaurant. There was only one waiter for our area and he was not very attentive and did not realize that we were sitting for 35 minutes after ordering without any food at our table. His excuse was \"I punched it in and don't know what happened\", not very consoling for a $350 dinner. The food was sub par as well. Our expectations were much higher than what they delivered. The steak was dry and flavourless. The seared tuna was cold, the \"greens\" was a joke. They gave us a piece of shaved cucumber with a few flowers??? What a joke!  Overall one of the worst experiences for such an expensive dinner. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in TO. 
Classy deco with unforgettable ambiance.

Everything was cooked to perfection and beautifully presented ! 

It is a must try if you are visiting TO and are craving French food. Definitely won't regret!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice in the last month and both times have been fantastic.  

The setting is gorgeous and the service is faultless.
I've been lucky to try quite a few dishes and overall the food has been fantastic, presentation amazing and great flavors, I would give a 4.5 over a 5 and the only reason being is the apertizers could be better but otherwise that is the only thing I can fault.

For starters I have tried the potatoes salad, frogs legs and hamachi. All presented amazing but just lacked the flavors or something extra of a 5 star. Frogs legs were interesting I would have liked mine cooked a little more.

For main the we had beef and lamb for two - both were faultless. Hands down the best meat dishes I tried in Toronto.

Dessert was the mango cheesecake and the chocolate dessert (cannot remember the name) but they both disappeared so quickly. My husband who doesn't normally want dessert wanted to order another serving of the chocolate one he like it so much.

The bread at the start is a great touch along with the little truffle with the bill,
I would recommend everyone visiting or living In Toronto try this place- you cannot be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance here. The interior is really nice and they offer an outdoor patio too. I came here for summerlicious and I enjoyed the chicken leg confit. The other entree that I tried was the tuna nicoise sandwich, this dish was alright."}
{"text":"4/5. Auberge Du Pommier is my favourite O&B restaurant. The food in fantastic and the ambiance is romantic. I recommend the scallops to start and the lamb shank as a main. The lamb is very flavourful and melts in your mouth. My husband had the halibut and he was pleased with it as well. Overall, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance, attentive service, consistently high quality and tasty food. Frequest guest, and will continue to be."}
{"text":"This place is beyond words. You are treated like royalty the moment you walk in. Someone greeted us and opened the doors for us. The hostess is friendly and asks if you want to check your jacket if you have one and if there is a small wait for your table they ask if you want something to drink while you wait.

The moment you are seated you already know that you will have a fabulous time here. Your server comes over a few minutes later and introduces themselves. Our server was absolutely fantastic.  His service was immaculate. He was very helpful and was glad to answer any questions we had. We had the Chef's Tasting Menu and it was superb. 

I can wholeheartedly, without a doubt, say that you will NOT be disappointed. Bring your sweetheart here; the ambiance is beautiful and pretty romantic. However, if you don't have a sweetheart to bring here, come with some good friends, you'll have a great time as well!"}
{"text":"My favourite French restaurant.  The food is always well presented and the service exceptional.  The food is always top quality and the flavouring is perfect and not over the top.

The only thing is I wish the portions were larger...but for fine dining it's normal."}
{"text":"Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! I went for summerlicious for lunch. $25. Very good deal!

Dessert - ice cream bar is the best I ever had.

Service, food and atmosphere, excellent!

The only small problem is the sign of man or woman's washroom. I do not know french and it takes me a bit of time to figure out the right room to go in. I wish that there was picture instead of French word at the door!"}
{"text":"The best restaurant in the city. I've tried all of O&B's restaurants and they are all great, but this French cuisine is on another level.

For every anniversary, my one and only request is to dine at this restaurant. The atmosphere is incredibly romantic, service is always top notch, and the food is absolutely amazing. Every bite melts!"}
{"text":"This is the last of my summerlicious reservations and by this point, I was hard to impress. Auberge had a tough job to do - and it hit the spot on most counts. It only paled in comparision to Canoe ... but that is mainly b/c I preferred Canoe's spectacular view and earthly food.

All in all, Auberge succeeded in terms of ambiance - it was cozy and inviting. Quite romantic for a date .. if you were on one. The service was good when it came to being friendly and attentive. However, the delay inb/t courses was a failure. I had not been made to wait that long for a bread basket before. And I think the lag time between each dish was probably around 15 minutes. Also, when I left, the clients waiting by the door were complaining about the wait time (one said that this was the 'most terrible wait time for a reservation'). 

The food was good - the cod was a bit interesting (since it was creamed up and pureed) but very pulled together. The chicken tasted quite mild but pleasing. I would have liked a bit more kick to it tho. As for dessert, the mousse was a great end with its combo of sweet-and-tart.

I would probably return for another *licious event but I recommend the first seating as the second seating appeared to be waiting for AGES."}
{"text":"Before I would give Auberge 5 stars but now unfortunately the service and food is not so excellent. But it has still gets 4 stars for its outstanding French food. They  just recently started the fall menu and that may be the reason for this downgrade. But hopefully they will improve soon."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here to celebrate my birthday.  We were lucky to get a table for 2 in a relatively secluded corner which was perfect for a romantic meal.  

We ordered three appetizers (my husband literally thinks I'm eating for 2 now that I'm pregnant).  
1) Champignon 
This was a dish with an assortment of forest mushrooms, soft poached egg and a puff pastry atop porcini puree.  It was absolutely divine! The mix of egg yolk with the porcini puree was so good! By far the best appetizer we ordered! 

2) Champignon des Pins
This was presented beautifully with a single large scallop, mushrooms, clams and a consommé was poured atop at the table.  The scallop was cooked perfectly and you could taste the sweetness of the scallop so distinctively.  My husband really enjoyed this but I thought the consomme was a bit salty for my liking. 

3) Escargot 
This dish was very green.  It had a large spinach ravioli in the centre with 4 escargots on the side covered in a green sauce.  The escargots were good but I found that the ravioli again was a bit too salty for my liking.  

My husband and I both ordered the dry aged beef rib eye as an entree.  The beef was so tender and cooked to perfection! As well, it came with a bowl of something they called \"pomme surprise.\"  This was my husband's favourite! It was literally a bowl of buttered mashed potatoes which were super smooth hiding braised oxtail beneath.  You literally had to dig for the oxtail \"surprise.\"   I don't even want to know how much butter was in those potatoes but it was so good.  This by far was my husband's favourite dish.  The dish doesn't seem quite large when you receive it but I was stuffed after finishing half the dish.  Thankfully my husband still had room to finish mine off for me.  

For dessert, we ordered the sorbet and the souffle.  
1) Sorbet - There were three flavours - raspberry, chocolate, orange.  The flavours of each of the sorbets were so intense and so refreshing.  The raspberry was served atop pomegranate seeds, the chocolate was atop cubed pears and the orange onto of diced oranges/ clementines.  Amazing! The perfect way to end a meal in my opinion.  

2) Souffle - There was a mild lemon taste to it and they poured white chocolate ganache into it.  It was quite good but I definitely preferred the sorbet.  

The service at auberge was fantastic as well.  The manager would come around at almost every course to check on how we were enjoying everything.  So much attention to detail as well.  Everytime we got out of our seat, a server would come and refold our napkins.  

Overall, amazing experience.  The food was delicious minus the few salty appetizers and the service was impeccable.  Would definitely come back but probably on special occasions as this was not light on the wallet."}
{"text":"Went here last night to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We have been here twice before for special occasions and it is still as delicious and decadent as we remember.
  
We ordered the chef's tasting menu and each serving was perfection.  We especially enjoyed the fish course and the desert, but honestly every bit was unique and memorable.  A foodies delight- truly.

The staff were lovely, attentive and knowledgeable.  They really seem to enjoy what they do and appreciate where they work- and it shows.  Its a rare combination to have such fine cuisine and feel so comfortable in your surroundings as well.  

Its a splurge, but its a food experience you won't soon forget and I can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"I booked this venue for our company Christmas party ( not the usual \"romantic\" occasion).  We wanted an upscale experience that most would not have had prior and I will be honest at the price per person my expectation bar was up there!  This establishment is quaint and cozy, we utilized a private dinning room and upon arrival the staff was well dressed, professional and attentive.  The first course (of either soup /salad) was fresh and just enough to have us anticipating dinner.  The main course consisted of either \"chicken\" /\"beef\" -to your desired effect and a veggie option.  I had the beef and requested it medium rare which to be honest was accomplished. This medallion was balanced on a bed of pan seared kale with a smear perimeter of celery root (it was a good thing I had eaten earlier).  I was more disappointed when Pierogi served as the veggie option; as I was expecting something a little more creative as we discussed a roasted veggie filo. Now for the bad news... the dessert, Sunken chocolate cake... not desirable with a burnt after taste and quite dry; this comment was noted by many.  

On a positive note the presentation of all courses were enticing.  I loved the tailor maid menus that were designed w/our company logo and the décor  looked fabulous.  

I will be honest... it's an impressionable venue and definitely the type of restaurant you may want to bring an important client, date or celebrate a milestone of some sort just so you (or they) can say you splurged,  3.5 Starts!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant and can certainly be considered as one of the premier restaurants in the city.  The atmosphere is perfect and the staff goes to great lengths to ensure that you are having a great dining experience.  Naturally, it is an expensive restaurant although it is surely money well spent and an ideal restaurant for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Perfect for an intimate dinner. Had a birthday dinner with my girlfriend here and the staff were delightful. Took care to make sure that she felt special and attended to her every need. The food, as can be expected, was excellent. 

The ambience, atmosphere, and staff really elevated the evening. The food was just a delicious, wonderfully-prepared addition."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic meal in a warm and comfortable setting.  Service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Great ambience.  Went for winterlicious.  Since there was 3 of us, we tried 3 different appetizers: terrine, soup and duck croquette.  Well, the soup portion was tiny.  Croquette was ok but a bit on the dry side.  Terrine was the best of the 3.  We also sampled the 2 types of beef and Cornish hen.  The hen was vey tasty.  The 2 times of beef was a hit and miss.  Steak was nicely cooked to medium rare but the rib was quite overcooked.  Again, plate temperature overall was luke warm.  All happy with our desserts the lemon tart and chocolate.  

Overall, an enjoyable meal and we would go back."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife for summerlicious this past weekend. We had an amazing time and will definitely return! For the appetizer, we both had the soup consisting of melon gazpacho , it was lovely and perfect for the summer! For the main course my wife had the coulette steak which was cooked perfectly. I had the salmon which was also tasted really good and came with a nice variety of veggie's to complement the dish. Presentation I must add was excellent, to a point that you did not want to touch the dish! For the dessert, the chocolate mouse was quiet good, but the panna cotta was better. highly recommend that dish! service was excellent as well. definitely lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5 
Service: 5 
Ambiance: 4.5
Overall: 4

I honestly thought this restaurant would be my first 5-star rated review on Yelp. I couldn't wait to break into the 5-star threshold. Sadly, Auberge du Pommier didn't quite make it.

I'm from North York so having a gem like this in our area was a plus. The exterior and interior of the place is beautiful. The decor has this wonderful, rustic yet elegant vibe to it. Our host made sure we were promptly seated and our servers were helpful and topped off our waters throughout our stay. 

Unfortunately the actual food is when things started to go (slightly) downhill. I realize that we came for the Summerlicious lunch menu and that the food pales in comparison to their regular lunch/dinner menus so I have kept that in mind.

Order: country pork pâté, chopped salad, tuna niçoise sandwich, chicken leg confit, cheese-fruits-and-nuts, strawberries and cream, and the chocolate and coconut parfait.

The pork pâté was ok. Nothing stellar about the dish, though the sauce à la moutarde was quite good. Chopped salad is chopped salad -- the vinigarette was light and perfect for an appetizer. The tuna sandwich was interesting. It was basically an open-faced sandwich that my friend found very difficult to eat. She commented that the tuna salad itself lacked flavour (maybe a little more black pepper or cayenne to add a little kick). The toasted bread it came with was supposed to be black olive, though she said that she didn't get any olive flavour at all. The chicken leg confit was a little better. The fine herb pistou went well with the chicken and the overall dish was pretty good.

We enjoyed the desserts as well but we all agreed that the chocolate and coconut parfait was the best.

The problem with my first experience at Auberge is that while their fare is for the most part really good, none of it was memorable. Nothing was worth going home and dreaming about/drooling over.

Overall I give this place a solid 4. Perhaps I need to try their regular dinner menu to actually be wowed and finally give them the 5 stars I think they deserve. Well...time to save up I guess!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time during lunch for the regular menu before winterlicious begins, certainly did not disappointed! The service was very friendly and attentive, our server brought the menu and helpfully explained each dish to us then gave us some time to place our order as bread and water were served to start us off (the bread came with a spread which was very good).  One of us ordered the parsnip and pear soup which the individual said was delish and for main the three of us ordered duck confit, pasta with veal, and a full order mascarpone risotto. Every dish was soooo good! My risotto was rich and creamy (also plated with care of course) and the three shrimp on top tasted fresh and plump along with a nice touch of veggies like cauliflower and endive. Was able to steal a bite from the others and the duck was cooked to tender perfection ummmm the veal was juicy too! During the meal the server checked on us to make sure we are doing okay and after we finished our main he came to clean the table along with the dessert and drink menu (oh he was very nice and sociable :) of course we are ready for the second round! Again I asked him about the dessert choices and he did a wonderful job introducing each and I settled on the gateaux au fromage which was a chèvre cheesecake with lemon curd and pistachio ice cream. When it came and when I took my first bite if that cake and ice cream oh my goooooooodness it was like heaven the ice cream had a rich nutty flavour accompanied by the salty pistachio pieces and the cake went with the lemon curd beautifully with that tangy citrusy goodness I can't even.... Overall will return to try dinner or wintercious to see the differences!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's wedding...and now, I regret not getting married here.  AMAZING service, delicious food, and AMAZING service.  

Champagne was served as we entered the restaurant, and I was expecting at the time.  Without saying a word, a waitress went to the back and brought me this delicious raspberry spritzer concoction knowing that I couldn't imbibe.  Then during the service, I was given a fan and a glass of ice water to drink.  I couldn't believe the kindness and thoughfulness they showed me during this wedding.  

The food!  Glorious food.  We had steak with a cold potato salad.  Steak was tender and juicy and potato salad creamy and savoury.  We all wanted seconds!  (Portion size could have been bigger I guess).  Dessert was a hazlenut chocolate ice cream dish and we couldn't say enough good things about it. 

A beautiful setting, thoughtful staff, and delicious food.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Effortlessly delicious. We had brie in pear to start and each of us ordered something different. I had the pasta my friend had the risotto. So good! For dessert the creme Brule was out of this world."}
{"text":"Beautiful, amazingly presented and delicious food. Expensive but certainly worthwhile for a special occasion (my husband took me there for my birthday). We were both amazed by the attentive service, the beautiful presentation and the delicious food. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because my husband had preordered 1 chocolate soufflé for us to share (we always share dessert) and they brought us 2, which would have been fine if they hadn't charged us for both, $20 each! My husband didn't want to make a fuss about it but it did unfortunately tainted an otherwise wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Auberge du Prommier does not have the most stylish and modem decor but feels cozy and very elegant.   The services I received at Auberge du Pommier are always pleasant and friendly.   I have tried both the à la carte menu and Summerlicious menu and this review is based on the latest Summerlicous dinner menu. 

Watermelon Gazpacho
- I enjoyed the Gazpacho a lot as I can taste each flavor from the feta cheese, mint and cucumber and they blend in very well. 

Salmon & Peas à la Française
- it is not my favorite dish, but probably because I prefer the taste of raw salmon rather than fully cooked salmon.  Nevertheless, the salmon is very moist and the broth was amazing. 

Ice Cream Sandwich
- Nothing was left on the plate, so I probably don't need to say much.  

My friend ordered Fried Green Tomatoes and Filet Mignon. Accordingly to him, both dishes were great.

The food from Auberge are usually amazing.  However, sometime a hit or a miss based on my personal likings.  In spite of this, I always enjoy my visits to Auberge du Prommier."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i love to indulge in the restaurant experience. last year (this is before i discovered yelp! otherwise, i would have written this review the day after!!!!) we selected this restaurant which was recommended by a friend who happens to be in the restaurant business. we take his suggestions whole-heartedly because he has an extraordinary palette for flavour. 

as mentioned in the previous reviews, the atmosphere is just gorgeous. we went during the summer and it was wonderful to sit on the patio under the brightly striped yellow and white awning. the music was delightful and seemed to be reminiscent of what it would be like to be in Paris (or at least portrayed in classic b&w movies).

in addition to the ambiance, the waiter was very informative and spoke a little french (enough for us to comprehend). i think it was at this point that we felt we were living a Parisian experience.

then we were greeted with our dishes. what delightful dishes to the senses. the appearance seemed crafted by an artiste! they really know how to make food look appeasing to the eyes. 
the flavours were balanced well and complimentary. we had no problem clearing our plates.

so if you would like to take a quick vacation to Europe, here's a great opportunity to do so -- without the hassle of carrying your luggage around."}
{"text":"I love it! I went with my boyfriend for a quiet dinner. It's a cute little restaurant with very attentive staff. We were seated in a cozy terrace. We had the tasting menu with wine pairing. All seven courses were excellent! My favorite dishes are the scallop and kobe beef with morels and the duck liver. It was full of flavor. Dessert was raspberry bombe. I was a bit weary about raspberry dessert, I always find it too tarty. But, this was excellent! Nice balance of sweet and tartiness. The wine pairing was a bit too much for me. I had 9 glasses of wine! 

I think it's cute that they insert a hint of apple flavor in some of their dishes to go with the name of the restaurant....such as apple bread (best bread i had), apple mustard sauce that come with the charcuterie and the apple sorbet.

It was a lengthy dining experience, we were there for 4 hours. But, you'll need it to enjoy each course and the wine. Overall, great experience. But, next time, I'll skip the wine pairing...since i'm a light weight when it come to alcohol."}
{"text":"We booked a dinner here for someone so busy flying in and out just landed in Toronto and already on a day trip to New York.  They make it on time, surprisingly!  I arrive early and the first impression is the service of the waitresses are exceptional.  They are always polite and smiling.  2 careless mistakes are my menu booklet does not have any menu in it and no bread is served to us.

We order a 2005 red wine. The aroma is so good that I like more to smell than consume it.  It has its depth and is not too dry.  The price is not expensive at all.  

The appetizer Mariné & Cru (Hamachi sashimi, sesame tempura) is beautifully presented like an art piece.  The Rabbit Tortelini is smooth and creamy but I cannot tell whether it is rabbit or not.  The lobster bisque although is good but I expect more from this restaurant.  The lobster meat is fresh but it does not have the very chewy and bouncing feeling in your mouth.  The bisque should have a more stronger flavor of lobster.  The bisque can be warmer.

For entrée I order Fletan (roasted Pacific Halibut) with saffron rice.   Halibut is perfectly cooked.  Meat is butterly and can slice out layer by layer, though the side is as usual not the same as the centre.  Boeuf is tender and juicy.  For the other entrée, I see my guests are happy with them.

Last comes the dessert menu.  We all eye on the Soufflé Citron. When it comes, the shape balloons up.  It does not have very strong lemon smell and you have to taste it.  The Sorbets and Fruits have 3 different flavors and each Sorbet is placed on top of diced fresh fruit.  The Croustade aux Peche is baked like a traditional apple crumble with fruit inside served with ice cream.  I like the ice cream more than the crumble.  You have to order it and share between 2.  After all that, then comes the complimentary macaroons with different flavor like chocolate, pistachio, strawberry.  Each one can have a piece.  The macaroons are no comparison to those in Paris and they seem to come out from the fridge.

With the same chain of restaurants, Canoe is still better.  Auberge Du Pommier and Jump come next.  Given the food quality, wine, environment and service, I will give it a 4 star.

Tips:
I was told 2005 French wine should not go wrong.
Remember to stamp for your parking slip for free parking at night."}
{"text":"I went during winterlious. The atmosphere was very good. The staff were attentive but not intrusive. The food, however, was not as good as expected. I ordered braised beef for the main course. It was a little bit hard and not very flavourful."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars*

Auberge du Pommier is probably one of my favourite places to dine next to Splendido. Every time I've come here I've always been quite happy with the service and the food. The reason for a half star off is because I also have come here for summerlicious and it was not the usual great stuff.......although still good.

The whole look of the restaurant is cozy, quaint, and gives an all over romantic feel which is perfect for a date. The moment you walk in, the servers greet you warmly and throughout the whole evening they make sure to check in with you, fill your water constantly, and patiently answer your questions if you have any.

One thing about dining here is be prepared to spend quite a bit of time, usually a dinner here can take up to 3-4 hours between the wine, amuse bouche, and palate cleansers that come during the meal. Generally speaking a wonderful restaurant that is worth returning to."}
{"text":"Went for Summerlicious dinner on Jul 11, 2013 - had a wonderful time with my girlfriends. 

We sat in the patio (has retractable roofing), and the ambiance was great. 

Food was delicious as well - I really enjoyed the melon gazpacho, steak, and the chocolate & coconut parfait."}
{"text":"4.5

Went for the Winterlicious menu, and was very glad I did. Atmosphere was warm, formal. White tablecloths, waiters in aprons and vests. Crumb sweepers. I found all of this to be friendly and accessible, and the service was punctual and pleasant, but a little perfunctory* (see bottom) at times. 

Our party of four covered almost every dish on the list, except for the chevre parfait for dessert. Soup was the stand out starter, with a lovely, rich-flavoured broth and perfectly poached egg. The smoked salmon was tender and melted in your mouth. Spinach salad was competent, but not entirely memorable. 

Mains were all very good, but I liked my pork chop the best, and it came with a very tasty sweet potato puree and braised cabbage. Pot au feu had a tender short rib and dashi broth that I sopped up with bread.

Sticky date pudding for dessert was one of my favourite things. A very moist pudding/cake with candied ginger and warm sauce poured on top. The sauce was so luxurious that I could have had a bowl of sauce and I probably would have been happy.

*I really couldn't find too much fault, but I took off a half point for atmosphere. I know it is Winterlicious, and they are trying to get many tables through. Service was very quick, and efficient, but at times I felt as though it was a bit of a factory atmosphere -- process the clients in the fastest (although polite) manner. This wouldn't stop me from going back, and although I wouldn't make this my weekly neighbourhood stop, a once in a while might be nice. I think it would be interesting to explore the outer reaches of the regular menu."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious. Service was good, food was nothing special. I expected more. Probably should come here for the regular menu..."}
{"text":"Came for our anniversary. Atmosphere was great for the occasion and service was excellent. Food was lovely loved every single courses. The only reason I'm giving a 4 star is that I feel the main courses weren't as surprisingly good as the rest of the courses. Overall, Thanks for the great dining experience! I will be back to try out your new menu for spring or summer"}
{"text":"I've been to many of the high end restaurants in Toronto (North 44, Bymark, Canoe, Harbour Sixty, George), but Auberge definitely is my favourite.  The atmosphere is classy, but not stuffy.  The food is amazing!  Got to love the souffle."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant! Food, ambiance, service - they're all excellent here! Definitely worth the price :)"}
{"text":"We came here to try out the food as this place was one of our list of wedding options.

I find that the food is on the salty side and a bit overly flavoured for our liking.  I kind of expected higher grade ingredients to be used so over-seasoning would not be necessary.

The food was not bad, it's just that at $100 per person, I expected more."}
{"text":"Let's just preface that I went to Auberge on my first Winterlicious event in a tshirt with a pornstar on it. My friend and I did not research the experience to be expected of when we attended. With that in mind, we were treated no differently than our well dressed counterparts. Apart from the cheeky \"first time here?\", we got consistently superb service. I've been told most restaurants slack during the 'licious' events, but the management definitely did not fall into this category. 

The decor is clean, simple, and plush. Everything was made and tasted beautifully. I brought back my family to dine again and the manager recognised me from my edgy impression last time lol and we received gelato on the house. They definitely aim to give you the most special experience ever!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there for our 1 year anniversary and I was completely blown away!!  I had never been to a restaurant as fancy, and as inviting as this one!!

When we arrived, someone took our jackets and walked us to our table.  The food was obviously amazing..but the service was even better!  There were waiters walking around with samples of food that they offered to everyone.  And this is the best part...our waiter asked us what our special occasion was and we told him that it was our anniversary.  He thought we were married!!!...and he came back with a little dessert plate with the words \"Joyeux Anniversairee\" written on the plate with chocolate!!  It was just so amazing that he thought of that!...but of course we had to tell him afterwards that we were not married..that it was a different kind of anniversary ahaha.  

I don't know when I'll be back, cause you know...it is quite $$$$$$$..but it was honestly worth the money!!"}
{"text":"Auberge Du Pommier is a cozy restaurant with staff who are warm, welcoming and caring for their guests. We went for Summerlicious 2010 but were really going to check out the restaurant as my sister is getting married there. The maitre d' was more than welcoming including adding a sorbet palette cleanse between the app and entree. Even for Summerlicious the food was incredible and the service impeccable. This is definitely an A+ experience and my sister and her fiancé were sure of their choice in wedding venue."}
{"text":"I went here for Winterlicious lunch. The place was beautiful and the staff was very welcoming. It was busy, but not loud, so it will still cozy and intimate. I bet this place would look very beautiful in the summer time or at night. 

For starters, I had the Fruits de Mer (mixed seafood, winter citrus, cucumber, soy bean, radish, chili-citrus vinaigrette, lavash). I didn't really like the presentation of the dish: miniature pieces of seafood floating around in a red sauce that was broth-like consistency. I didn't enjoy this at all. 

For my entree, I had the Crêpe Gratinée (buckwheat crêpe, braised chicken, mushroom ragoût, Tuscan kale, Comté Mornay) and it was delicious. The only thing I would change is to have the mushrooms cut in thinner slices. 

For dessert, I had Fruits du Verger (poached pear, Parmesan cream, caramelized pastry, mulled apple cider). I thoroughly enjoyed this! The mulled apple cider went excellent with the pear. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I highly recommend this place for a special lunch or dinner out. It was mainly groups and friends during the lunch hour, and I would assume more couples during the evening."}
{"text":"#Summerlicious 2017
(My first one star review!!! Yay...?)
So this place is supposed to be right on Yonge St, and I've driven pass at least a dozen times without ever noticing it. And today was no exception. Turns out it's actually in a plaza, and the sign is only visible FROM THEIR DRIVEWAY. How is that helpful for someone driving pass and just couldn't figure out where the heck it is?? I also spent like 10min circling the fences, trying to find an entrance...Gah, the French.
My mood was visibly lifted when I got seated at the loveliest corner table. It had wonderful lighting, a leather couch, and the most elegant decor. However, it was what came next that dampened my mood -- namely, the food.
Appetizer - foie gras (1.0/5.0) This was a mixture of something something something... I don't even know what they put in there, but it sure didn't taste like any foie gras I know. What it did taste like was meatloaf straight from a can, and no one even thought of pre-heating it before serving. The texture was disturbing, and the taste reminded me of cafe food. Not the good kind either (cuz THAT would actually be made fresh). While I don't necessarily hate cafe food, it's definitely not something I would expect from a restaurant like Auberge du Pommier...not even on Summerlicious. And it's not even good by cafe food standards!
Main - salmon (2.5/5.0) Overcooked and dry. Yeah. Didn't really taste fresh either. I get it, it's Summerlicious, everything needs to be prepared beforehand blah blah... But please, at least do a decent job of TRYING to hide it. Like using quick-freeze, or something. (Learn from your sister Canoe!!) I liked the combination with the sides, the flavor was very interesting, but the texture was a bit like reheated leftovers. Other than the corn salad, which was a complete disaster -- tasted like it came straight out of a plastic container, then someone forgot to refridgerate and let it sit outside overnight. Yeah, BAD. Glad it didn't pollute the rest of my food, which was a bit hard to swallow, but still edible.
Dessert - chocolate hazelnut cake, with icecream scoop and rasberry sauce on the side!! (4.5/5.0) Finally!!!! Something with actual heart in it!! Probably ranked it higher than I should, since I was fiddling with my phone and by the time I got to it the ice cream already half-melted. But who cares! This was the only decent item of the entire meal. I even considered getting an extra scoop of ice-cream... But since I had trouble get any of the servers to notice me, in the end I just went for the bill instead:/ Which brings me to the next point--
Service(0.5/5.0) - Shocker! Seriously, I was THIS close to skipping tip at the end. Food took forever to arrive, empty dishes were piling up on the table, and my server completely forgot I was there about halfway through the meal. Normally I'm not even big on service, in fact I'm willing to completely overlook it as long as the food is good. But in addition to bringing me BAD cafe food, you made me sit at the table for 2 hours just to eat it??! NOW I'm pissed. One star. Seriously guys, don't do Summerlicious unless you came prepared:P"}
{"text":"Came here with my mother for summerlicious. Love the environment/decor, food was well worth it. Overall a great experience if you can afford it regularly!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, beautiful backyard garden. Had high expectations though."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED my first dining experience here. Despite the Winterlicious Rush, our server  was surprisingly attentive - we didn't feel pressured to eat faster because there was a huge line at the door. He even took the time to fold our napkins when we went to the restroom. With the restaurant at peak capacity, his demeanor was extremely laid back which translates into a pleasant dining experience for us.

The prixe fix menu had choices we all loved. My favorite was the braised beef cheek - it was so tender, I didn't need a knife to cut into it. The dessert was also amazing - I had the meringue, which was played beautifully!

The only complaint I have is about the hostess. She was visibly distressed at the lunch rush and trying to seat everyone based on their reservation time. I just think it would have been more professional if she didn't snap at the people waiting or those following up with her to check how much longer they needed to wait. 

Overall, I had a great experience here and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Having heard great things, I was excited to finally try dining at this venerable Toronto institution. In one word, it was a letdown. 

When I dine, my priorities are, in order, food, service and ambiance/decor. At this establishment, the priorities appear to be reversed. The space is remarkable, and the layout elegant. The service, particularly from the front of house and wait staff, was excellent - attentive and formal without being stiff. The sommelier was for me mildly haughty verging on irritating, although I'm sure there are people who would find him charming. The service was neither memorable nor a disappointment.

The bill for our party of four was $650 for cocktails, appetizers, mains, desserts and one bottle of wine (we brought another of our own and paid the $35 corkage fee). The meal was bookended extremely well - the cocktails (particularly the House Tonic) and bread were excellent as were the desserts. Especially fine were the Bordeaux-style petit fours that accompanied the cheque - why aren't these on the menu!? The whole table raved. 

Before discussing the rest of the meal, a note about the menu. There are two tasting menus available - each can be selected with or without wine pairings. Unfortunately, these are only available if the entire table participates - an uncertain proposition at a table of four or more. I very much wanted to try the Gourmand Menu with wine pairings, but alas, I was the only one at my table so inclined. Vegetarians should also be cautious - there was only one vegetarian main course on the menu. 

Appetizers and mains were a disappointment all around, unfortunately, with the Mariné & Cru app being the one high point. The 48-day rib eye was surprisingly chewy. The duck was the biggest disappointment at the table - dry, tough, and accompanied by an overwhelming amount of beets that made the presentation boggling if nothing else. 

At the end of the night, we all had a good time. We were expecting more from the kitchen, and that was certainly a disappointment - perhaps they were just having an off night. Ultimately I can't see myself going back. There are many places in Toronto to have a better meal for less money."}
{"text":"Auberge is a beautiful French style restaurant with great ambiance and service but it all heads downhill from there. We are here after all for the food and it is simply is not the mind blowing experience it should be for the price. Mindful of the previous mixed summerlicious reviews, we opted for the full blown experience and am afraid to say that it that the food is pleasant at best. The only thing keeping it out of the one star range was the exceptionally attentive service and great cocktails. I'll have to pay attention to summerlicious reviews in the future. I cannot recommend."}
{"text":"We were originally going to order off the regular menu, but then looked at the Summerlicious menu and thought those options sound good so let's go with that. Wrong decision. Order off the regular menu, people, unless you want a second class experience. 

The chicken and leek terrine starter was really good. Not out of this world good, but good enough. Portion size was good. Flavours were good. I was happy with that. And my dining companions were happy with their starters.

The mains are where things went downhill. We all ordered the beef option. It was some kind of steak (I forget what the menu listed as the cut of steak). This steak was very very tough. We ordered medium rare and we could barely pierce it with our knives. I thought I was going to have to ask for a sharper knife, like a chef's knife or something. 

Also, it was very poorly trimmed. Two of us had a very thick (we're talking at least half an inch thick) fat cap on about half of our steak. And the knife provided just was not up to the task of cutting through this tough fat cap. I had to flip the steak over and hack at it horizontally from the bottom since I wasn't getting my knife cuts done vertically on this tough, gristly cut of beef. I'm sure if we had ordered off the regular menu as we intended, we wouldn't have ended up with this tough, poorly trimmed piece of meat. 

The desserts were also hit and miss. The chocolate dessert was raved about. The panna cotta wasn't touched after the first forkful (Yes, I said fork! You shouldn't be able to eat a panna cotta with a fork!)  because of an excess of gelatin. It was literally panna cotta failure 101. The pastry chef would have been kicked off Top Chef for this elementary error no question. I had the \"clafoutis\". I'm putting quotation marks around clafoutis because that's not what I was served. I was served a pretty decent almond cake with cherries. This was not a clafoutis. A clafoutis is not dense and almondy like marzipan. A clafoutis is soft and custardy like a thick flan or a cross between a souffle and waffle batter.  

I'd come here again to try out the regular menu, but not be served an inferior version during Summerlicious or Winterlicious."}
{"text":"Always my favourite French restaurant. Great food and nice selection of wines. I gave it five star because one time I was there and the waiter suggested a wine which we didn't end up liking, the floor manager came by and asked how everything was and we expressed our concern. He told us no problem and brought us better wine without charging the other two glasses. That's customer service at its finest. Throughout the dinner, the manager came several times himself just to make sure everything was okay. Highly recommend this place to everyone and it's my go to when someone say French cuisine"}
{"text":"Great front of house/table service and romantic setting, but unfortunately found the food to be mediocre.  There was lots of veining in our foie gras appetizer, which became all the more apparent when it's in such a small piece to begin with (though the tiny portions don't come as a surprise, so no real complaints for that part).  Serving the foie atop the cornbread was nice to soak up the delicious foie oil, but it made the cornbread crumble so much that basically became a paste.  There was a piece of what I think was the pistachio praline, but instead of snapping crisply, it was like chewing an old, semi-melted piece of caramel that was difficult to swallow.

The sturgeon/esturgeon was pleasantly smoked, and the black radish was a nice, acidic contrast, but the bacon linguine fell flat - no particular standout about that pasta.  The halibut/fletan was tasty and moist, but the singular razor clam was tiny, and the 1\" potato cut into three medallions the size of dimes was hardly enough to serve as starch. 

I would judge differently if Auberge was any of the other O&B restaurants - but at $50 per entree, my expectations were not met."}
{"text":"Don't you dare come in here with jeans.  This place is business casual.  The waiters are very polite, but quite pushy... \"Thank you I can get my own napkin on my lap.\" The food is very delicious and ingenious.   The portions are small but perfect if you are having the three course meal.  I have come back to this place several times and would recommend it for what it is.  Great job!! Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious and has a great experience. Super fancy and their wine selection is impressive. Friendly staff and a classy & elegant atmosphere. Would I come again? I would definitely, for something fancy."}

{"text":"This is fine dining at its finest.  The ambiance is lovely, decor classy, service fantastic, and the food... DIVINE.  Guys, if you'd like to impress a lady, take her here!  I myself went with the girls, native Canadians who swear by this restaurant.  

Appetizer--Coquilles St. Jacques, caramelized sea scallops with kobe beef cheek: Very good, though I did enjoy the scallops part more than the kobe beef portion

Entree--Veau Poche, veal tenderloin and fried sweetbreads:  Ever since I learned about sweetbreads from the food network (yes, I am that lame) I take every chance to try them.  Auberge did not disappoint!  The sweetbreads had a great flavor and a lovely crunch.  And the veal tenderloin was soooooooo tender and tasty.  It was absolutely exquisite.

Dessert--I cannot remember exactly what it was, there was a cheesecake (?) with a praline crust (yuuuuum) and a bit of sorbet (passion fruit possibly).  You might think that because I cannot recall, it must not have been really good.  Wrong!  It was awesome!!!  Not too sweet, great flavor, and ended the meal on a fantastic note.

If you loooove food, and especially if you like fancy eats, this is the place to go.  It is expesnive, yes, but totally worth it.  You will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"The food is out of this world!!!! Wow, the service was phenomenal! One of the best restaurants I ever went to. The price is definitely worth it, high quality food, the taste is amazing. Braised beef cheek, duck liver and beef tartar! So tasty! I will recommend this place to everyone. It is also very romantic, and perfect for engagement parties and weddings! If you are a foodie, YOU have to TRY this place !"}
{"text":"There is a reason why Auberge is constantly ranked as one of the top restaurants in Toronto. I came here last night to celebrate a big milestone - a great family friend's 87th birthday. It could not have been a better night.

We were led to one of my favorite areas in the restaurant; the small-ish nook with the fireplace. We had a corner table, perfectly private for the special occasion. My mom noticed, for a Tuesday night, how busy the place was. This speaks to, again, just how great the restaurant is.

Appetizers for the table included Hamachi, Salad, and I had the Mussel soup which was creamy (but not heavy) and it had little chunks of potato which was a nice surprise. For mains, I had the Canard which were delicious morsels of tender duck breast meat. Each meat had a sliver of fried skin which just completed each bite. My bf had the Lamb Shank and the only thing left on his plate was that long lamb bone. And finally, my dad had the Tuna which was one of the best pieces of fish he ever had. I could see how purple the Tuna flesh was which meant it was fresh as can be.

And for dessert, if you haven't tried the Lemon Souffle, you have been missing out!!!! Oh man, it was so good. No matter how full you are, you have to try this soft, warm, delicate piece of cake which comes with a warm, Lemon-drizzle poured delicately into the dessert.

Service, as always, was impeccable. Smiles, charm, and just what Auberge is all about. 

For a special occasion, you can never go wrong here. Everything is absolutely perfect. Also, if you can get seats by the fireplace area, I would highly recommend it. 

FYI! Remember to park underground as your ticket can be validated at the front desk. Also, bathrooms are downstairs, but for those who cannot make the trek through all those stairs, there is one bathroom located on the main level."}
{"text":"Always hesitant to try out legacy places, they, imho, draw a different type of clientele (upmarket parent's generation, scenesters, those celebrating a special event etc.) with different expectations. Our hesitation was warranted. 

Dinner:
Apps: crab croquette and foie gras 2.5-3/5
Mains: rabbit ravioli and monk fish 2.5-3/5
Desert: chocolate brûlée 3.75/5
According to Joanne Kate's review, this place charges a modest corkage fee if you choose to bring your bottle. 

Service: 4/5 friendly
Ambience: 4/5 beautiful in a rustic kind of way

None of the dishes were even good. They were all average at best. This place survives probably because Toronto's fine dining scene lacks umph. Throw in a couple of friendly francophone waitstaff, and upmarket prices and ambience to boot, this becomes the post game hangout for the Rosedale croquet club. The rest I'm guessing can't wait to tell their 'laws in Richmond hill how they wined and dined their daughter at a charming midtown Provençal resto :)

Overall for these prices the value was 2.5/5 
Repeat: NO

Take your money and spend it elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's good to know that no matter how much time passes, I can always return to Auberge and it still has the same impeccable service, speed, and quality that I remember. If you enjoy absolutely beautiful fine dining, and service that makes you feel like royalty, this is the perfect place for you. 

Would absolutely recommend the tartare, as well as the foie gras, both superb. If this place is out of your budget, wait for the Summerlicious and Winterlicious festivals where you can dine at up to half price with absolutely delectable tasting menus."}
{"text":"Fine foods, slow and poor services. 1, I asked the front to hang my jacket once we were seated but when we sat down, she walked away and forgot this. 2, We finished the entree and then waited longer than 15 minutes for the waiters to clean the table off.   They came around over and over again but just didn't want to clean the table. :("}
{"text":"3.5/5 
Second time visiting this place and got to say the service and food wasn't as great as the first visit. 
Having said that, both the food and service were food but not outstanding. 
The menu has some big winners like foie Gras and the desserts are just mouthwatering. 
I will still recommend this place for a nice and fancy date out"}
{"text":"After hearing about this restaurant for decades, my SO and I finally made the trek up to Yonge and York Mills in June. I feel that we had built this restaurant up in our minds to be something sublime, and after having experienced some exquisite meals at 5 star restaurants in Toronto, we expected another 5 star experience. It was not a 5 star restaurant in our eyes. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was nice, but that's about all it was. The food was under-seasoned and not very interesting.The decor was old-fashioned. The service, however, was impeccable. The foie gras appetizer was the stand-out item, with the perfect balance of savory, buttery and sweet. After existing for so long, I think this restaurant may be stagnating and coasting on its reputation."}
{"text":"Stopped into Auberge to see the new menu and reno.
I was greeted very nicely by the two female hostesses.
This encouraged me to consider them for my birthday.
I called to make reservation and spoke with a VERY rude French man.
I too am French but I was raised with better manners!
As a shareholder in a few restaurants I know the importance of first impressions!
Unfortunately, he does not!
When I asked for a reservation, he made me feel like he was doing me a favour.
He stated that he seats over 400 people daily and that he doesn't know if he could fit me in.
I thought his disposition to be deplorable and a sad reflection of the Oliver and Bonacini brand.
I took the handout reservation but later decided to call back and cancel.
It's unfortunate that the French manager and his ego are ruining this restaurant.
The food, wait staff and hostess are even walking on egg shells around this manager.
A real shame that it takes one bad herring to spoil the barrel.
Many patrons have complained of this manager's attitude.
Maybe it's time to reconsider his position within?!
Remember, the hospitality business depends on the patrons."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate my husband's birthday and were not disappointed.  The price is high, but the quality is unmatched.  I got the steak tartare for my appetizer and it was really good and a decent amount of food.  It came with several crustini and various accompaniments such as pickles and radish.  For my main I ordered off the tasting menu to get the canard a l'orange which came with roasted sun chokes and grilled endive.  The duck was delicious, cooked to a nice rare and the orange sauce was a perfect accent.  For dessert we got the cheese tray with 5 different cheeses, one Canadian and four French.  It came with some delicious quince jam, a block of honeycomb, and lots of crispy \"feuilles\" to eat with it.  All in all it was a really great meal.  After we were finished, they brought out a \"Happy Birthday\" plate for my husband with some cream puff and truffles on it which was a nice addition.  

This is the third time we have been to this restaurant and I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"It was a first time visit for Summerlicious '16 for a lunch menu, decided to give it a try because I really liked Canoe and for the \"Oliver and Bonacini\" name. Wasn't the most fun experience. 

Salade - as an appetizer it was disappointing. There was a balance of texture and taste but no balance as a course; the salad itself already made me feel this was enough for the meal. Did not excite my taste palete to want to continue. Mediocre at best for a fine dining restaurant's appetizer. 

Soupe - exciting for first three scoops, really loved the flavour and the mix of different summer seasonal ingredients. Afterwards, was possibly even worse than the salad, it was pretty boring and rather weird after the first three because of the soup's unique texture and taste. 

I was really disappointed at this point because I brought my partner all the way from Waterloo to Toronto just to try out a summerlicious course menu, but this was subpar and lacking almost everything I expected from. Then came the main course, which was actually better than what came out as the \"appetizer\". Scary, I still think they did this on purpose. 

Saumon - very moist, cooked almost to perfection, loved the garnish. My partner didn't like the garnish but they complemented the oceanic dish with an earthy, well-rounded flavors. Too bad the garnish on top of the salmon fell when it was placed on our table, but the presentation was still not too bad (;

Beouf - very classic and followed French style of cooking well, not the best but what can I expect from a Summerlicious menu; it met my standards very well. Had to eat it with the garnish else I would only have eaten the steak, but overall very well presented typical French style dish. Rounded my mouth up well from before to continue on to the finale of the course. 

The main course brought our paletes back, and was really excited for the dessert! Then came another tragedy. 

Clafoutis - very very very very, very. Very; ve-ry, veeeery, veRy, VERY; okay I'll stop. It was very plain, borderline boring. The compote wasn't too special, the pastry wasn't too special. Just well-rounded clafoutis we would expect from a good patisserie, or even from the fancy Loblaws at Yonge and College. 

Panna Cotta - I still question the Kisses looking mini cookies that came along, it didn't complement the dessert at all. I can see that the point was the contrast in texture of the slimy, jelly-like panna cottage and the hard crunchy texture of these cookies;  honestly would've loved it if they had a bit more saltiness to it, to really augment the sweetness of the panna cotta, but they tasted really blend amongst other components of the dish. The panna cotta itself wasn't bad at all, I really love panna cotta so I'll give it a 4/5 with a bias. 

Overall, the service and interior design, the atmosphere; on that side of the restaurant I'd give it a 9/10. However the quality of food I received for the price I paid, I'm still disappointed. Hopefully later I'll convince myself to try an actual dinner course out later, but for now I'll pass."}
{"text":"Been here two times over the years (one of them was on Valentines day).  Nice restaurant in terms of set up and decor with very friendly service.  Definitely a place you go for a local fine dining experience.  My only bone is in the pricing and yes, I did know what I was getting into.  Bottom line...this feels like a Michellin priced menu and I didn't feel my meals were at that level.  And I've tried maybe 5-6 Michellin spots across NYC, Cali, Portgual and France.  

I recall trying various things like the fish, cheese plate, foie gras, lamb, etc. and it was all good with some better executed than others.  But I can't stop benchmarking in my mind, especially when dropping $300+ on dinner. That being said, it's always been a fun experience and I'd still put it on my short list for fine dining in TO."}
{"text":"I came here for the summerlicious event and this is BY FAR my favorite place ever. The venue is decorated like the country side of france and it was elegant but not overly luxurious. And the FOOD i think i had the filet mignon of some sort and it seemed like a small platter but it somehow filled me up?? I used the bread and swept up every last drop. Would come back if I could afford it"}
{"text":"I went to Auberge du Pommier last evening in a group of four.  It was, in every respect, superb.  This was the best restaurant experience I have enjoyed - and by this I mean more than just the food - in the last year.  Wonderful food, amazing wine selection, exceptional staff, and a wonderful setting.  I'd go back in a heart beat."}

{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious lunch and it didn't disappoint.  For a mere $25 a head for the  it was very worth every penny.  Service was amazing as the server was friendly and honest about his recommendations.  They gave us some bread to start off and we got the Mojito which was not bad.

I got the Mediterranean Sea bass and it was done perfectly.  It was so tasty and the fish was not dry at all.  Portion is on the smaller size but that is what you expect from the upscale places.  My gf got the lamb susage which she didn't like that much but I foudn it to be not bad as well.

Auberge Du Pommier has an amazing atmosphere and the decor is just lovely. They have an amazing outdoor patio as well too bad the hostesses never asked if we wanted to sit outside.  The service is what puts this place above the rest, the server was attentive and friendly.  My gf ordered the cheese platter for dessert and didn't like it one bit, the server saw and without asking he told us he will bring out the ice cream sandwich for her as well.  So we ended up trying all 3 dessert on the Summerlicious menu.  

The only problem I got was the washroom, how I should have paid attention during french class all those years in school.  Took me an extra minute to find out which one to go into as there was no picture and the words were in French.  I had to read the words out a few times like a little kid. Thank goodness no one saw. haha

{"text":"I decided to give this place another chance and here is my update.

I had 3 appetizers and a main course.

Apps:
Bisque : 5/5 Absolutely delicious!
Sweetbreads : 5/5 Again, loved it completely.
Foie Gras : 3.5/5 Tasty, but the combination on the plate is heavy on heavy on heavy.

Main:
Duck breast : 1/5 It was served nearly raw and chewy (I couldn't swallow it, had to spit it out), the sauce was not a good companion to the duck and the lettuce side with sour minced meat in the middle was just bizarre. I sent it back and kind of lost my appetite.

What a terrible end to an otherwise very tasty meal.

On a side note, their bartender serves a really great Martini."}
{"text":"In love! Great lamb, awesome service and amazingly large portions (from what I'm used to being served in French restaurants) - we could never get to the cheese plate! Will be back as many times as I can afford. :)"}
{"text":"Note: review is based off Winterlicious 2017 experience.

Location/Service
- Easy to find location (York Mills/Don Mills) with free underground parking when you dine at the restaurant
- Service was okay.  I assume because it's winterlicious - the staff is not super detail as they're probably bombarded with lots of people coming in and out.  Waiter was still friendly so it was acceptable
- Atmosphere/environment is very classy (be sure to dress up a little) and restaurant is pretty quiet.  We were a party of 9, but I don't think we were too loud to ruin other people's experience

Food
- Dinner was $48/person with a few selections of appetizer, main and dessert
- Portions were a little smaller than I thought, but expected as it's winterlicious.  They did provide bread on the side (which was really good with unlimited refills)
- Appetizer was the shellfish & squash bisque.  I liked it very much as it was heavy in the squash component.  It was thick and creamy.  Curried pink shrimp were there to give it a little kick of seafood
- Main was the rainbow trout.  I'm always a little iffy about ordering fish in western restaurants as I tend to find it a little dry - and as expected it was.  The skin was very crispy on the other hand - and with the couscous, it helped balanced it out with the fish meat.
- Dessert was the lemon tartlette.  A very standard French dessert - nothing wrong here.  It is a little sour as the lemon flavoring was pretty strong, but it was good for my tasting.  There's also elderflower and honey to help soothe it good.

Overall the winterlicious experience was alright.  I would like to come back and try their regular menu and see what kind of difference does it make - and hopefully bump up my rating :)

My other friends who were there also enjoyed their meal, especially  the tenderloin & short rib (which was very juicy and cooked to the right expectation)."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to visit this restaurant for a while and found just the right occasion to have dinner with some friends before heading to Paris to help prepare my pallet lol. I am always a bit hesitant with modern fine dining as the dishes are usually smaller and if the intricate tastes are off it's almost a shame. However, I was not disappointed at all. The meal was delicious. The flavours wee finely tuned and a delight for the pallet. Service was excellent. My wife and i started by sharing a lovely mushroom bruschetta, scallops and an apple Camembert. The scallops melted in your mouth with a very rich and buttery flavour. The bruschetta was also very good with multiple types of sautéed mushrooms on goat cheese with arugula. The Camembert was not as good as the other starters but there was nothing bad about it either. Very nice salad and flavours going on. For dinner I ordered the duck breast served medium with a nice Pinot noir. This was without a doubt the highlight of the night, rich and flavourful it made me think about converting and never having steak again. It was excellent. For dessert I had chocolate and marshmallow cake, my wife the apple sorbet. Both excellent as well but a bit small for the price. Service and food were excellent however the dinner was marred by one thing the entire evening. There were tons of fruit flies all around annoying us and disrupting our meal constantly. The dinner service on the patio had the door left open and many bugs were flying around including some mosquitoes, really an unfortunate annoyance to a great meal. I shall return but in the winter I think. Price is high but worth it for special occasions, go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Conveniently located just west of Hog's Hollow, this restaurant is one of the hallmarks of the O&B line up, consistently ranked as one of Toronto's best alongside O&B's Canoe. Its tasting menu is well constructed, although my night was ruined by an unappealing blue cheese dessert that was paired with an equally strong and unappetizing wine. Nevertheless, that verdict came down to preference (I don't like blue cheese) and it would be unfair to write them off because of one unfavourable dish. They're not as good as Canoe, but they're still one of the best."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Best quality, delicious food. By far, best steak I had in my life. Amazing atmosphere. Minus one star because we had a difficult time finding the restaurant, as it was hidden. And also, minus the one star because of the pay-by-the-hour parking."}
{"text":"Wife and I went for winterlicious and it was a very positive visit.

The hostess was polite and the food was great would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant going back to Auberge du Pommier because of my not-so-pleasant experience at NYE but because I have been a long-time diner there, I wanted to give this restaurant a chance to redeem themselves.

Can I just be cliché and say the difference from the last time I dined to this time (March 6) was night and day?

My evening started off on the right foot by being warmly greeted by Maître d'hotel, Joel Centeno, who apologized for my last experience and reassured me that this time it would be what I'm accustomed to having which is a relaxing and enjoyable meal. 

Each member of the waitstaff that I personally dealt with were both courteous and professional to me with special kudos to my pleasant and knowledgeable server, Krista (who advised me well on the dishes to choose so I could have a nice and  cohesive meal) more than made up for the service from last time.

And while I never had an issue with how good the food tasted, it was the pacing of my meal that was my biggest issue--who wouldn't feel rushed and very unwelcomed if you got three out of six dishes within 30 minutes of ordering!--HOWEVER on this occasion Chef Malcolm and his brigade were on track with my server and waitstaff and executed perfectly the timing and pacing of each dish.

Oh my goodness, it was nice to actually savour and enjoy everything that came out of the kitchen! Every dish was amazing to both my eyes but more importantly to my taste buds!

From splurging/indulging in the Acadian Caviar with blini and traditional garnishes to all the other dishes I had (Noix de Saint-Jacques, the seared Foie Gras, Côte de Buf with that extra indulgence of black truffle), I could taste the love and hard work that went into  each plate served.

And then the wine pairings that Joel chose for me to go with my dishes complemented them beautifully. I do have to say that my favourite was the pairing  between the Chateau Eugenie Cahors Malbec and the ribeye. Just perfect.

My ONLY disappointment was with such a rich meal I could not make room for one of Chef's decadent desserts nor have a cheese course from what looked like an amazing selection to choose from! (BTW the collaboration between Auberge du Pommier and The Cheese Boutique can only be a good thing. Looking forward to trying them the next time.)

I did have room for a double espresso as well as somehow managed to make a little space for the complimentary small plate of sweets that included a couple of petite macaroons and madelines each that Chef sent out.

I admire that Auberge du Pommier was so willing to turn that bad experience I had, completely erase it from my memory and replace it with this phenomenal one. And while I do know I was given extra attention because of last time, it also proved in my eyes that what happened at NYE was an anomaly and NOT what this restaurant promises to deliver.

Thank you for a wonderful evening. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for dinner, and each time they manage to deliver - the food is consistently excellent, and service is top-notch here. 

The restaurant's rustic yet elegant decor is vaguely evocative of the countryside, and fits the name rather nicely. Seating is ample and not cramped; the lighting provides a nice ambiance without being too dim. 

There's 2 tasting menus available (one is vegetarian) along with an à la carte menu, although tasting menu items can also be ordered à la carte. Dishes lean towards classic French cuisine with innovative twists here and there. My most recent entrée was the beef rib-eye, which came with \"pomme surprise\" - perfectly creamy mashed potatoes with a very flavourful braised oxtail at the bottom. 

The servers are all friendly and attentive - all dishes arrive at the same time and waters are topped up frequently; service here runs smoothly and I haven't encountered any issues here. While some of O&B's other concepts aren't run quite as well, they definitely have a winner with Auberge. 

There's an underground garage that provides validated parking, which is appreciated particularly during the wintertime - just ask at the reception desk."}
{"text":"Winterlicious Review

It's pretty decent. I guess its not too bad at the Winterlicious lunch  price ($28), but I'd feel a little unhappy if I paid the Winterlicious dinner price (or the full price). I'd say this was my least favorite \"icious\" meal to date (that being said, I usually am pretty selective with the places where I go for the \"icious\" meals).

Appetizer: Pâté de Campagne, which is basically pate & bread. I did like the pate in this dish.   The bread was nothing special. My wife ordered the salad which looked (and tasted) very mediocre, so I'd recommend avoiding.

Main: we both ordered the beef cheek. This was probably my favorite course. The beef was cooked well... it was quite juicy. Also, its a fairly generous portion. There wasn't much else on the plate though... a few greens  if I recall correctly. 

Dessert: these  were  a bit of a let down, especially considering that this is a French restaurant. Ordered the \"Vacherin aux Grenade\", which consists of meringue and pomigranate. It was fairly ordinary tbh. Wife ordered the \"Gâteaux aux Amandes\" (almond and apple cake), which was pretty good... the cake was moist. I think it would have been better with a bit more ice cream on the side. 

Service is friendly, but I think they were a little understaffed. It was a full house at lunch, maybe because of winterlicious."}

You really feel like you are at a special place eating something special. So when it comes to atmosphere, auberge du pommier is definitely tip top. 
Food wise, i have never been disappointed here. 
I dont know if they still have this particular lobster dish I fell in love with but this was the best lobster i have ever had. 
The amuse amouche the chef sends out are always perfect and well appreciated."}
{"text":"I felt the most fancy when I went here. The location is so unique and has such history and just being there is a treat! The food was absolutely divine, the wine was amazing and the service was next level. Actually what you'd expect from O&B!"}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for this place, as my coworker who closely follows the restaurant scene told me that this is the best rated restaurant in Toronto. I came for summerlicious a week ago. The restaurant is hard to find, and cannot be seen from the road as it is surrounded by trees and there is no signage, its in a business complex. Use your GPS to find. 
The restaurant is definitely upscale, beautiful, service was great. 
The food... was just okay. Appetizer nothing special at all, my salad at home tastes better. 
My chicken and potato was good, but did not blow my mind. 
And the desserts both lacked. 
I have been to many restaurants for summerlicious and in general and some of them really did impress me. However, when I can make better food at home... 
The drink was mediocre, the coffee was fantastic.
3.5, because very romantic and beautiful place. Also $48 for dinner was overpriced for summerlicious."}
{"text":"Tried their winterlicious menu with my husband. For starters, I had the chicken terrine and hubby had the gingered carrot soup. The terrine was fine but the soup was really tasty and had a depth of flavour. For the main course i had the short rib which was on the dry side. My husband had the chicken breast supreme which i honestly thought was so plain. The desserts were just fine as well...a salted caramel choco tart that was more chocolatey than anything else and the blood orange parfait which was light and refreshing. Even if the food felt more \"homey\" than gourmet, the service was impeccable! Our server Monica was just awesome!"}
{"text":"I have been lucky to eat at Auberge du Pommier several times and loved it every time! It is so classy and intimate. What i love most are the chairs. If you can get seated on the right side of the restaurant, it is definitely even more romantic. 

The service is exceptional. I really enjoyed was the fois gras, steak tartare, mushroom soup (with parmesan biscotti) and the chicken main as well as the creme brulee. What I did notice however, over the past 3 years, is that some of the main portions had gotten a bit smaller; I believe they also changed their chef. Their winterlicious is a good \"deal\" but it will still be a more expensive night out. 

Auberge du Pommier is definitely one of those places that I would host a private party or celebrate any special occasion."}
{"text":"Auberge du Pommier

Fine dinning in Toronto's uptown. I was invited to a leadership tech talk at this fine establishment. Unfortunately the menu was fixed but still the five star quality was evident in the food preparation and taste. During our tech discussion the meal was served, we started with the salad of greens, asparagus almondine and a poached egg with a light hollandaise sauce. It was very interesting, probably not something I would have picked for myself. Then the main was tenderloin cooked to perfection at medium rare with broccolini with pomme-de-terre sarladaise with a jus au sherry et molasses. The main was absolutely perfect in taste seasoning and presentation. The desert was a light pineapple sorbet. I enjoyed this fine meal, paired ,with a nice cabernet sauvignon from the Napa valley. All in all a five star, will have to return to have a gander at the open menu."}
{"text":"My bf took me to here for my birthday dinner last month. It was a quiet and slow Monday. Atmosphere was great as usual.
We ordered snow crab and some sort of scallop  soup. I think scallop was very overpriced since it only had one piece of scallop and soup was very salty and heavy. 
Main dish was tuna and lamb. Lamb was a bit dry and had Nothing fantastic. However Tuna was very impressed. It was one of the best tuna I have ever had in my life ! It was cool perfectly wig well seasoning. I highly recommended it.
We finished the dinner with a chocolate mousse cake, which was a okay .
In summary, this was a very beautiful place with great service. I have been here couple times and only the tuna impressed me. Well, I will still give it 4 stars since I was my birthday dinner ."}
{"text":"I honestly thought I'd written a review on this some time ago -

Auberge was a wonderful experience with friendly, attentive wait staff and a relaxed, classic, slightly rustic decor.  The degustation menu was thoughtful and flavours balanced with good contrasts built into each dish - as was to be expected.

Alas, I'd developed a food allergy to shellfish and elected to make one substitution which they were gracious enough to grant.  While I can't be precisely sure, the egg-based substitute was tasty, but somehow, in that mysterious way that your body signals - didn't quite agree with me.

Well, my disagreement with that dish built and built - and let's just say the evening was just as unforgettable as the meal, albeit for nigh diametrically opposite reasons.

Be that as it may, I enjoyed my meal thoroughly, and look forward to a return trip, sans the insouciant bits of the experience."}
{"text":"Came here to try their Winterlicious lunch menu for $33.

I had the chicken terrain to start. The terrain is like a chicken pate served cold with a lentil sauce and sweet potato chips. It was a very refreshing appetizer that was seasoned perfectly. 

For my entree, I had the braised short rib with broccolini, beets, a grain rice with red wine sauce. The meat was braised perfectly - tender and melts in your mouth. It is probably one of the best short rib, cooked french style that I've had in a while.

For dessert I opted for the chocolate tart. It was good as well but probably not my favourite. The chocolate was almost too overpowering that I couldn't taste the buttery-ness of the tart and any of the other toppings such as the raisons, ice cream and the fruit. 

The service was quick and attentive. My water glass was never empty. 

The only con was the fact that you do need to pay for parking. $2.50 for every half an hour or $20 for day maximum. I believe night time is validated. 

Another con is the bathrooms need some work and attention. Two of the bathroom stall locks were broken so I had to go while holding against the door - the other two were out of service (locked). Just a little pet peeve of mine when going to a fancier restaurant. 

I would def. return to try other items on their menu. I also recommend making a reservation - this place does get busy."}
{"text":"This is a very classy outfit.

The room with pillars and pastel colours is pleasant and the tables are large with comfy chairs. The noise level is low enough to be able to hear any conversation at table clearly.

The service is impeccable and considerately paced.

We had the lobster and leek pâté which we found bland rather than exciting, but good nonetheless. We also shared the octopus and scallop starter with tapioca crispies which was prepared beautifully and very tasty. The halibut main came from a proper big fish and was perfectly cooked. The seaweed and vinegar contrasted nicely with the fish. The pheasant was succulent with some of it packed in pastry which was delicious and the Apple and fig on the side complemented it. The french fries arrived crisp and hot.

The wine list, as you would expect, is of high quality and expensive. If you bring your own, they charge $45 corkage.

Wonderful for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Auberge used to the be best restuarant in the city, and I had the best meal of my life there about 6 years ago.

We had a good time and the place is really nice, but the service has gone downhill in the last couple years.  Food as well.  Our waitress was great when she was there, but it took SO long in between visits from her.  It took 20 minutes after delivering menus to come take our order, and many things just like that about drinks, dessert, getting the bill etc.  The food was good, but not nearly as good as a couple years ago.  It's a nice place but value wise it doesn't add up with the food and service and very high price.  I hope they make some changes and go back to how it used to be.  I don't mind paying those prices, but the food and service need to reflect that."}
{"text":"Auberge used to be good.  It then opened the doors and lowered its quality to gain broader appeal.  Its dishes often seem to be thawed from frozen, similar to its related restaurant downtown Jump.  I can still remember when this was a very nice setting and the staff knew their guests.  People would greet me by name, but alas those days are over.  It's a revolving door."}
{"text":"C'est  tres bonne!  Came for a retirement dinner.  Really delish steak tartare app and foie gras apps. Service was friendly and attentive.  The parsnip soup was creamy goodness, white bass was cooked perfectly, and the opera cake dessert was chocolate goodness.  Good for a splurge and special occasions."}
{"text":"3.5 for the food, but rounded up to 4 for the service and ambiance. The setting is adorable. It's like you're eating in someone's house. 

In terms of food, I tried all of the appetizers on the menu. The foie gras appetizer stood out, and the beef tartare was good as well. I wasn't a big fan of the octopus appetizer because of the dried olives. We also had scrambled eggs with white truffle (not on the menu), and it was very tasty. 

I tried a few of the entrees - canard a l'orange, lamb shank, beef cheek, and grouper. The duck was tender for the most part, although some parts were tough to chew. I really liked the flavour combination of the grouper dish, as it had a bit of spice to it. Beef cheek was super soft (melt in your mouth) but I would prefer beef cheek in a bahn mi as opposed to as a main dish. I think I'm used to chewing more when beef is a main. The lamb shank was also very tender, but I've had better lamb shanks before in terms of the sauce it comes in.

I had the souffle for the dessert and the orange white chocolate sauce that they pour into it is quite delicious. 

They gave complimentary creem puffs at the end of our meal, and those were yums! The stuff inside the cream puffs tastes the same as the souffle sauce? Mmm"}
{"text":"I ate here during the Summerlicious thing. I loved their menu. My date and I were extremely pleased with the food, atmosphere, and the service here! It was a quiet and intimate evening with excellent food and a great table on their terrace. Can't wait to return for Winterlicious!

The decor inside of the restaurant is a bit stuffy and formal. That's the only thing that was a bit off-putting. Who knows, maybe I'll have a different impression come February."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, this is one of the best O&B restaurants, and one of my favourite French restaurants in Toronto. Came for Winterlicious this time and we  ordered the beef and sea bass. Food this time was ordinary but may have been the Winterlicious menu. The soup to start was very nice, however the salad was average. Just a large plate of greens, quite bland. Third member of our party ordered the lamb confit. They use the lamb shank, the cheapest part of the lamb, but it was tasty with Moroccan spices. 

Definitely recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food (especially their venison and the escargot), but their jus and consommé were really salty and over powering."}
{"text":"Of all the O&B restaurants Auberge is definitely my favourite.  Nestled in North York, and away from all the hustle and bustle of downtown restaurants, Auberge is definitely unique.  The exterior and interior of the restaurant makes you feel like you are at a fancy, rustic, yet elegant, cottage.  The decor is very simple, mostly white.  I especially love the French windows. 

Upon entering you will be greeted by the hostess/host, and they will promptly take your jacket.  The restaurant is nicely lit (unlike some of the dark restaurants downtown where you feel like you're walking into a Screamers event), and if you're lucky, you may even get seated near the fireplace.  

I have dined at Auberge twice, and even after the second visit I left with that same 4-star feeling as the first.  I've had their Coquilles St-Jacques, Foie Gras et Confit, and Veau Trois Facons.  The foie gras was melt-in-your-mouth goodness, and the confit just melted off the bone - definitely a must try!  The Coquilles St-Jacques was a little too deconstructed for my liking, but nonetheless, still very tasty.  The veal was juicy and tender.

I like Auberge because it is a quaint and quiet restaurant where you can enjoy meaningful conversation, and not have to shout over each other (probably the only O&B restaurant where this is the case)."}
{"text":"Winterlicious at Auberge du Pommier!  I've always wanted to dine here for a 'licious meal but never was able to make a reservation until this year when I used the Aeroplan advanced booking system. 

Auberge du Pommier is a super fancy French restaurant that has been in North York since 1987.  It's a very intimate and sophisticated restaurant lined with wine bottles when you first enter.  They also don't have any ground parking so you'll be parking underground on a complimentary basis with the restaurant (the hostess will stamp your parking ticket for you).  The restaurant itself is located on Yonge Street and somewhat hidden away from the main road.

We were brought to our table after the reception ladies took our coats into the coat check.  I liked how they used a small metal numbered plate for identifying our coats instead of a paper note -- saves paper and made it seem even more fancy.

We were led into the dining room which was so gorgeous and dimly lit.  I expected service here to be top-notch because this was definitely a restaurant that was known for its attentive service and hospitality.  I expected nothing less.  (That night, a server personally led me to the washrooms [which were located down two flights of stairs], the server folded K's napkin when he went to the restroom, and crumbs were swept away from our table using a special tool.)

The Winterlicious prix fixe meals have all gone up in price this year.  For dinner at Auberge du Pommier, the price was $53 per person this year.

We were immediately given bread and butter to start and served our drinks.

The food was all really good that night and arrived in a reasonable time (with the exception of the appetizer which arrived at lightning speed after we had placed our order).  What I didn't like about the night was that our server didn't introduce or explain our dishes to us.  Instead, it was simply, \"Here's the beef.  Here's the chicken\".  I noticed that our neighbours next to us had a server who very thoroughly explained very single ingredient in the dish to them.  I would have appreciated that kind of service for such a classy restaurant.  I wonder why our server didn't do that for us?  Details matter especially in a restaurant like this.

The Terrine was a very meticulously assembled dish that looked like artwork.  I love dishes that look like this!  I expected the terrine to taste more gel-like and smooth.  Instead, it was more rough in texture than I expected.  I also don't think I've had chicken terrine before.  It's always been pork in the past which led me to a false assumption about this terrine.  I liked the two dollops of foie gras in the dish.  The sweet potato was crispy like a chip!  The pickled turnip helped to break up the dense mass of the chicken terrine.  In my opinion, the chicken terrine could have used a little bit more flavour as well.

The Smoke Trout was also a really pretty dish and assembled so delicately.  The smoked trout was really tasty!  This dish also had a tarty component to it.

The plating of the Boeuf was so pretty again!  I liked the smear of the hop jus on the side.  The best part of this was definitely the tenderloin!  I asked for it to be done medium rare and as such it was so incredibly smooth, tender, and moist!  I loved how tender it was.  The second part of this dish was the braised rib which was also done very well.  It was so fatty and flavourful!  I also liked the pearl barley in this dish.

I liked the bacon part in the Cornish Hen and the tenderness of it.  The thigh part of the chicken was much more tender and tasty than the breast part (it came as two parts on the plate).  K liked the crispiness of the fritters.

The Tarte was a really good dessert!  This chocolate tart was made with high quality dark chocolate.  It was detectable from the first bite with it being so dense and bitter.  It was amazing.  I couldn't taste the salted caramel too much though.  I also found the cookie part of the Tarte way too hard to break apart when I tried to eat the filling of the tarte together with the tarte itself.  The vanilla ice cream on top of it was a great pairing.  The rum raisin crumble was really good as well; slightly sweet but chewy and a good addition to the dessert's textures.

I'm always curious about olive oil cakes.  The portion of this dessert was smaller than the Tarte.  I think they could have made this olive oil cake a little thicker and bigger.  The green apple sorbet was refreshing and the fennel reminded K of more of a summer dessert or appetizer.  Its light taste also contributed to that feeling.

Overall, it was a really nice French dinner.  I only wish our experience was elevated a little more with even better service.  I think service with 110% more effort from our server would have made the meal even more special.  Regardless, I'm still really grateful to finally have tried Auberge du Pommier out!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner as part of Winterlicious 2018 and was immediately struck by the ambience and decor. While the restaurant exuded a classic French elegance, it still managed to feel cozy with exposed stone walls and wood burning fireplaces. The hosts and servers were incredibly friendly and they actually called ahead of time to let me know that the underground parking is free. 

I enjoyed how there were many menu options and for starters we decided on the Terrine (Heritage Chicken & Foie Gras) and the Truite (Smoked Trout). The smoked trout really delivered in flavour and the pickled jalapeños were a nice touch. However, I did feel that the Terrine lacked flavour and was somewhat underwhelming. 

For our mains we ordered the Boeuf (Tenderloin & Braised rib) and the Poulet (Cornish hen). The tenderloin was the highlight of my meal as it just melted in my mouth. I felt that the Poulet was a little on the salty side but the crispy skin on it gave it a nice mouthfeel. 

To cap off the night, we got the Tarte (Caramel & chocolate) and Gateau (Olive oil cake). I was pleasantly surprised by the Olive oil cake having never tried one before. The cake was nice and moist and the olive oil flavour was not overwhelming at all. The pastry for the Tarte was very well done and flaked beautifully under my fork. 

Overall, it was a lovely dinner and while I did expect a little more from the meal, the excellent service made up for it. If you're looking for a nice night out, I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went to Auberge du Pommier for a Winterlicious meal and were more than impressed by everything about this restaurant! I'll definitely consider going again when my pocketbook can handle it, for very special occasions.

The restaurant decor was beautiful: intimate but not stuffy. The chairs were super comfy and they had a real fireplace burning. Fantastic for the cold, winter day on which we visited. It felt very relaxing to be dining there and we were able to sit back with some great food and have a conversation. 

My sister and I both had the leek and cabbage soup. I found it a bit too salty but I loved the croutons on top and how they served it with a poached egg. For the main course I had the pot au feu which was really tender. My sister had the pork chop: it was the thickest one I've ever seen! She let me sneak a few bites and it was juicy and incredibly flavourful. If I had the meal over again, I might have switched my entree to the pork chop. For dessert I had the sticky date pudding and loved it! It was pleasantly lighter than I expected it to be. My sister was in heaven with the chocolate mousse cake. 

More than anything, I was really pleased with the fantastic service we received. I've heard that Winterlicious customers don't always get treated very well at these upscale restaurants but that was not at all the case at Auberge! The staff were obviously immaculately trained and were more than polite, they were really friendly and helpful. Like with the decor, I was again pleasantly surprised the service was classy but not stuffy. They took our coats, tucked in our chairs as we sat and ensured that I got a delicious, dairy free meal (allergy). 

Go to Auberge du Pommier, especially for a lovely Winterlicious experience!"}
{"text":"This Oliver & Bonacini spot has been touted as one of Toronto's best for many years, and after a few visits it's pretty clear that there are far better French restaurants in the city if you're looking for a quality meal that's worth the ducats. Their fatal flaw? Trying to do way too much on the plate. A lot of sizzle, not enough bacon."}
{"text":"I've been to Auberge du Pommier once during Winterlicious. I think it was my first \"fine dining\" restaurant... Great bang for your buck if you go during Winterlicious.

I don't recall what I had - it's all a haze right now. But everything was amazing and I loved every bite! For a $$$$ restaurant, the service was humble and attentive. Our server was great, and he even brought us an extra desert when I joked \"I wish I could have another\". Oh that chocolate mousse...mmm

I'll have to make a trip there again soon."}
{"text":"Auberge du Pommier is a high-end French restaurant located in North York. The restaurant feels like a luxurious boutique hotel or B&B. The service was attentive and is would you would expect at a high-end restaurant. I would recommend this restaurant if you are in North York, but it is not worth the drive if you are not in North York.

I had a soup to start. The soup was fresh and light. For the main, I had beef. I found the beef to be overcooked and was a little rough. I ended with a delicious chocolate dessert.  The dessert was my favourite course of the evening. 

Auberge du Pommier is part of the Oliver & Bonacini Restaurant portfolio. It does meet the standards that I have come to expect at an O&B Restaurant but not the best restaurant in the O&B portfolio. Maybe Auberge du Pommier had an off night when I was there."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, but a bit of an awkward location (right beside a temple and office building). Overall, exquisite and authentic French cuisine with extremely rich flavours and a well thought out menu. The basement-esque feel wasn't my favourite, but the patio area is to die for. The servers were really kind, and eager to please. I had to request a more serrated knife for my duck, which was very tough. It was my birthday and they didn't charge us for wine! Really great. Definitely ehx-pen-seeeve. But worth while if you're a lover of fine French dining."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious and really enjoyed our time! Take the rating more as a 4.5 star. 
The atmosphere is probably one of the most gorgeous I've seen. It's very sophisticated, elegant, classic, comfortable seating, romantic, private areas and open areas. The decor is very beautiful. 

Food: 
I ordered the Terrine which had: rabbit & ham hock terrine, pork floss, apricot piccalilli, gingerbread. This dish is a cold, still very flavourful. 
Entree was: tenderloin & short rib, root vegetable Parisienne, celeriac croustillant, pomme purée. 
Dessert: Chocolat with salted caramel ganache, caramelized banana, cashew crumble, muscovado crisp. Very rich dessert yet it was still balanced with the banana and the muscovado crisp. 
We also got an Italian white wine to share. Very tasty. 

Overall the food was very delicious. Note that portions are smaller than you may expect. That could be just the restaurant itself or because it was winterlicious. Still, it was very flavourful, overall well executed. The reason why I would give this place a 4 star (4.5) was because it is quite pricey. My tenderloin was cooked perfectly but flavourwise, I've tasted much better at The Keg. Also, unfortunately my short rib was quite dry, not juicy at all and it wasn't easy to pull apart with just the fork which is usually what you would expect if short rib is cooked properly. 

The staff are amazing, friendly and inviting, and they all were very knowledgeable about the menu items, how things were cooked, etc. 

I would come back here, but probably not during winterlicious even though it may be more expensive, the quality of the food would be better."}
{"text":"To not be disappointed when dining, there are a few things I make sure to avoid.   One is Chinese-run \"sushi\" places.  Another is any restaurant run by a nightclub owner.  And the biggie is deals for cheapskates. I'm looking at you, Winterlicious, Summerlicious, Groupon, WagJag, and the rest of them.   I am not surprised that almost all the negative reviews for this place are from \"licious\" customers.  Don't go to a high end place expecting the high end experience when you're paying East Side Mario's prices.  What you end up getting is their version of wedding banquet food, mass produced on an assembly line (so the place can turn the tables twice as fast) with the quality to match.  Don't be so damn cheap; if you want the genuine experience save up your money and show up when the restaurant is at its best. When it ISN'T serving the cheapskates.  You might have to spend 50% more but you'll get 100% better quality food and service.  If I see a negative 'Licious review I disregard it.  There, I can get off my soapbox now.

All that said, Oliver and Bonacini are the undisputed kings of restaurant dining in Toronto.  Go to any of their places and ('Licious notwithstanding) you will never be disappointed.  Their flagships are Canoe (great view, modern continental cuisine with local ingredients) and Auberge du Pommier (classical French).  I hadn't been to Auberge in about 5 years so a revisit was long overdue, and once again the O&B team amazed me. 

As always, a small bowl of olives as well as freshly baked (and still warm) bread with butter is presented immediately after the menus are taken away, and is always a pleasant surprise.  It doesn't need much butter, it's that good.  For my appetizer I went with the roasted La Canardière foie gras served with Bartlett pear, parsnip puree and almond oat crumble.  If you've never had foie gras and have only seen it on the Food Network, definitely have it here.  The rich buttery liver melts in your mouth, and the accompanying components on the plate balance that out.  Main course I ordered Boeuf aux escargots:  braised beef cheek de Cahors, garlic & parsley escargot, pomme purée.  The beef cheek was braised slowly that the result was a very tender piece of meat that needed light pressure with a fork to cut. No knife needed for this!   Rather than dessert I went with the cheese plate to end the meal.  This consisted of 5 cheeses (4 French 1 from PEI) served with a honeycomb, quince jam, and crackers which served as palate cleansers. Of the 5, my favorite was the Langres cheese (as the server described it's so soft they have to cut it right out of the fridge... once it warms to room temperature it is heavenly stuff to eat, with the thickness and consistency of a very rich sour cream).  

Although it was several days after my actual birthday, they did bring out a \"cake\" which consisted of a candle to blow out, two blackberries, two chocolate truffles, two cream puffs, and \"Happy Birthday\" written in dark chocolate sauce. A pleasant, unexpected treat.

If you have a special occasion to celebrate (birthday, anniversary, milestone...) or want to impress family or friends visiting from out of town, you simply cannot go wrong by choosing Auberge du Pommier.  One big positive is that you don't have to go downtown and deal with the transportation hassles there; this is so convenient being just south of the 401 with free (validated) underground parking next to the restaurant.  Just don't go during Licious."}
{"text":"I've decided to return to this restaurant as it is one of my favourite of all times. I took my brother and his girlfriend to try the summerlicious dinner. Because I wanted to get a good glass of white wine to go with the trout. I asked the waiter if it's wild caught or farmed. I thought it was a legitimate question, but his reply was \"most are farmed anyways nowadays\" anyways the trout can use more flavour. The only highlight was the wild honey flower with the cheese. 

Next, my brother is very allergic to apples. Again as my brother and I scanned through the menu, we saw the word \"pomme\" and thought there were apples in it. Again the waiter's attitude and response wasn't good at all. 

Boeuf
beef tenderloin, pickled pearl onions, watercress pesto, heritage carrots, buttermilk pomme purée

The servers that were bringing our plates out were much nicer and friendly. And they reassured my brother no apples which I liked. I rather they serve me than our waiter. He didn't make me feel comfortable with our questions. It kind of ruins the overall experience and changed my previous perspective of this restaurant. Overall I did not enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"Magnificent! I especially love when I come here with one of my friends that is terrific at picking a good wine. However, I once had a meal so expensive my boss was a bit suspicious. In reality, the meal was expensive but the choice of wines was the culprit. I love the intimate atmosphere. It's perfect for a date or a business meal."}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious lunch today and it was great! The ambiance and service were amazing. I ordered the chopped salad, chicken confit and the chocolate coconut parfait. Everything was really tasty. They also have interesting iced teas..I got the preach lavendet...yum! The only complaint is the parking situation. The restaurant is located on York mills in an office complex and the parking is really expensive....considering Auberge is pretty pricey youd think they'd comp the parking. 

Another point is that it is part of the Oliver and bonacini brand...the other restaurants owned by this company have declined in quality IMHO so I hope Auberge doesn't follow.

Overall great lunch in a beautiful setting!"}
{"text":"I took my wife to Auberge du Pommier for her birthday. The staff were very helpful, the food was fantastic and the wine was wonderful.  Having recently returned from vacation in Paris I can safely say Auberge du Pommier was significantly better than any restaurant we found whilst in Paris."}
{"text":"Auberge du Pommier used to be my favourite five star French restaurant in Toronto. I am still a fan but I would no longer give it five stars and I strongly advise against visiting this restaurant for dinner during Summerlicious, as the portions and quality of food are severely diminished, where as the bill for two people, ( with wine pairings included), will be in excess of $200.00. This puts them in the $$$$$ category in my book.
 There are no s'amuse bouche or petit fours served with the meal this year ' which also added to my disappointment.
 Another case in point, I went to Auberge this year for my birthday, and ordered the prix-fix gourmand menu, as it is one of the finest dinning experiences, (especially with the wine pairing), that (IMO) Toronto or any O&B restaurant has to offer, but my wife is vegetarian and so had the chefs' suggested substitutions. Long story short, they charged the same amount of $$$$$ for both meals.
 Maybe I am getting too used to the cuisine or maybe I am too good of a chef according to my own tastes, because I can come close enough to duplicating what I have been served at the Auberge, for one quarter of the food price and easily half of the wine price.
 The wine pairings this year at Summerlicious were pedestrian at best and very over priced at $35.00 for two 3 ounce glasses plus one and a half ounces of Port or dessert wine.Charging $3 a glass when we ordered still water was just more insult to injury.
 I found the quarter of a NewYork strip loin that they served me to be quite tough and sinewy, with no marbling and not much taste. I can easily do better at home on my barbecue and have a lot more steak for a lot less money. The wine pairings are not worth what they are charging. I do however very much like their bartending mixologist and highly recommend the blueberry Mojito.
 I am sad to say that Auberge is starting to price itself out of business in the same way that Olivers' Wonderful Bakery Restaurant on Yonge Street near Hollywood Ave did so many years ago. What a fine establishment that was, especially in the winter with its' many fireplaces.
 The service and servers are still top notch but you should consult with the sommelier instead of taking the wine pairing. That way you should be able to get a whole bottle of wine for seventy bucks instead of half."}
{"text":"Southern France cuisine. Came here for a special celebration and tried their tasting menu. Expensive at $100 per person.

I think it's worth it for a splurge as everything was delicately tiny but delicious. Things that I enjoyed included a roast chicken dish, appetizer crab cakes, and lemon meringue tart dessert. They have a menu that changes quite often so you will always enjoy something new.

The restaurant's deco is so pretty, both exterior and interior, like walking into a garden.

Minus one star for the price."}
{"text":"Another Summerlicious favourite that I tried for the first time. Overall a great experience!

Complimentary bread: Nothing special here. Although I do appreciate the server inquiring about refills when we finished our helping.

Terrine (foie gras & pressed duck topped with gooseberries and cake crumbles): I'm a novice to foie gras, so take what I say with a grain of salt. My first impression was of some sort of canned meat. However, after a few mouthfuls, I began to appreciate the texture and flavours together. I especially liked how well the spice cake crumbles complemented the dish.

Truite (rainbow trout and fennel fregola): The trout was perfectly cooked - the skin was crispy and light and the fish flakes off easily. The fregola pasta was a bit on the oily side though.

Chocolat (chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream): No complaints here. I always love a good chocolate/hazenut/raspberry combo.

Auberge does their food reallyyyy well. Ingredients are well-chosen and creative, and the ambiance is posh and elegant, perfect for a date night."}
{"text":"Once again, my friends and I were participating in the annual Winterlicious events in Toronto.  Initially we wanted to try another restaurant, but it was already fully booked by the time we called.  We ended up visiting Auberge du Pommier, one of the Oliver & Bonacini restaurants for lunch instead.  Luckily I wasn't disappointed.

We had our reservations at 1:00pm on Sunday.  The restaurant was fully booked.  In fact, it might have been overbooked so we waited for 35 mins before our table was ready. There were lots of customers waiting at the foyer.  It was so crowded that we even felt like we were in a dim sum place.  There were also few minor mishaps.  For example, my chair had a nail sticking out at the bottom.  Few bits of herbs fell into my glass of water.  Our waitress was prompt to address the issue though.

Our first course choices were split between leek & cabbage soup or smoked salmon rillettes. I picked the leek & cabbage soup.  It was very delicious and light.

In terms of main course, again, we were split between two choices - roast chicken or meatball.  I picked roast chicken, which was very moist and tender.  Two friends ordered meatball, but they didn't like it.  They found it taste dry shortly after few bites.  The size of meatball was huge and inconsistent as well.  One was even large than a lady's fist.

We've decided to try all dessert selections.  I chose sticky date pudding, which was supposedly the sweetest of all three choices.  However, I found it the tastiest, and with the right sweetness.  The cake was very moist, and the raspberry sauce on the side balanced out toffee sauce's sweetness on top.  There were few tiny candied ginger bits too. Very nicely executed!

At the end of the lunch, we were gifted with few $25 gift certificates to celebrate with the restaurant's 25th anniversary.  It was very nice of them.  Thanks Auberge du Pommier!

Final verdict:  I really liked this Winterlicious lunch, and I think $25 meal was all worth it. 

4 stars (1 star taken off due to long wait and few minor mishaps)

Friendly reminder: Parking is available around the restaurant, but it is quite expensive, so don't forget to bring in extra coins, or better yet, use your credit card.  Our lovely waitress kept telling us that we wouldn't need to worry about paying for parking on Sunday as no one would check on the weekends. However, we've decided to not take our chances and went out halfway during our lunch to pay for our soon-to-be-expired parking meters anyway."}
{"text":"Pleasant experience mostly, spoiled by other patrons on Summerlicious....such as the clown in the shorts and wearing a  baseball hat, which he didn't remove through-out; and the young girl  with her sugar-daddy,  taking photos (10 plus) of her appetizer with the flash on

restaurants have to take responsibility for managing their premises including disrepectful and discourteous \"guests\""}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday during summerlicious.
I loved the atmosphere and the service I was provided with.
Definitely worth its price.
However, I wasn't 100% satisfied with the quality of the food.
I felt like they could have done a better job with the menu of summerlicious.
Probably one of top 10 French restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went in for winterlicious without much expectation for $28/pp. But boy was I surprised! I enjoyed every dish and even my food critic father-in-law give his thumb up and polished everything off his plate which is rare."}
{"text":"It was a pretty atmosphere -- for a quiet, poshy dinner... but pricey for the unsatisfying meal that I ate.

I give them stars for the gingerbeer Mojito that I had!! delicious -- i may try to make it myself.

I was really looking for foi gras -- its one of my fave things.. but i had better... it was ... meh..... not seared to a super juicy flavor that i was expecting!

I ordered the duck --- and it was not very juicy, but rather--- pretty dry... i didn't finish it because it was too hard and dry near the end. The portions were a good size though... but really really disappointed because I had hoped my duck would be more yummy. The flavors/sauce were really good though, but it lacked the JUICY explosion. 

It actually tasted like Peking duck -- but the way chinese restaurants make it tastes much juicier ..Unsure what happened to my dish at this restaurant.... 

since we were too full for dessert -- they gave us our bill with two macarons... Another star for that!!! 

1 star for atmosphere + 1 star for cocktail + 1 star for end of the meal treats"}
{"text":"Great place and fantastic special event venue.

Food quality is excellent, dining environment beautiful. During the summer sit outside on the patio and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times for lunch but this was the first dinner. We were a party of 4 having a business dinner.  The sign of a great server is how careful they are watching the guest. She anticipated our every move. Left us alone during conversations and note taking and arrived exactly when we needed her. 

The food is French inspired with local ingredients. This is a high end restaurant with proper techniques, quality and great taste. My appetizer was a perfectly cooked foie gras on top of corn bread, main was beef tenderloin with potatoes and short rib stuffed into onions. All excellent. My dessert was rhubarb souffle not my cup of tea and not sure why I ordered it.  My guest ordered their classic Apple Mouse dessert fantastic. 

Great service and food to match. A great choice for a special evening out with a love one or impressing clients."}
{"text":"I thought that I would update my review based on my 'Licious 13 experience ...

Service was amazing as usual; after each dish, our server came to the table to ask about it. I couldn't think of any adjectives so I kept saying, \"it was great.\" 

The ambiance is amazing - I love the decor; everything is beautifully presented.

Now on to the food:
Chopped Salad - fresh ingredients with a light dressing; rainbow of vegetables
Rissotto - skip ... it was a little bland imho
Chocolate Coconut Parfait - super tasty; I'm not a huge fan of coconut, but it was mixed with chocolate flavors"}
{"text":"Looking at previous reviews, it would be fair to say numerous recurring themes have already emerged and crystallized about Auberge:

1. The food is delicious
2. The food is beautifully presented
3. The service is fabulous
4. It is mega expensive

After visiting \"The Apple Tree Inn\" for my father's birthday, It would be inaccurate to not repeat the aforementioned four points. The food was utterly delectable, presented like works of art. Our servers were numerous and attentive, frequently begging us to take more bread on threat of death (well not death per se, but he really wanted us to stuff ourselves with their moist rye loaf. We were happy to oblige.) 

Oh, and it is crazy expensive. Like, $30 risotto expensive.

Here's the thing though: the spring pea risotto was *spectacular*. Even though I had ordered a ($37) salt-baked B.C salmon cooked to perfection, I was jealous of my date's risotto (thank god we're sharers!) 

It is difficult for me to justify awarding a five star review only because I didn't pay for the meal myself (thanks ma) and normally I would be a little more discerning while letting the William Lyon MacKenzies Kings fly out of my wallet to pay for a single meal. And yet, everything was as remarkably tasty as food can get. So let's call it 4.5 stars with the caveat that I would normally never buy a $23 St Jacques Scallops appetizer at that price point, but I am sure glad we did. Everyone left happy and satisfied; the bread was terrific and so was the cheesy spread it came with; and the service was, eager, earnest, and efficient."}
{"text":"A little bit slow, food was decent. nothing over expectation. one of our waiter looks like Thomas Barrow from downton abbey lmao."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night for Winterlicious and everything was absolutely perfect. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and gives off a very classy vibe.
The staff was very kind and accommodating. Our server was very kind as well and was always there to ensure everything was going as planned.
I went with 2 other people so we ordered a bunch of different items on the Winterlicious menu.
Personally, I ordered the quinoa salad to start. It was very light and was just the perfect bite before the main meal. For the main, I ordered the beef tenderloin and short rib. Believe me when I say it was the most tender meat I've ever eaten. The spinach puree that came with it was also very tasty. As for the dessert, I ordered the fromage platter. This came with 3 different types of cheese and wild rose/regular honey. The wild rose honey was AMAZING and was a perfect pairing with the cheese.
The food portions were the perfect size and I was perfectly satisfied by the end.
Really love this place and will probably be back for the next special occasion!!"}
{"text":"Many years ago, the company I worked for took our (very small) team to dinner here after a great month.  I will never forget that meal as it was the very best dining experience I have had in my entire life.  (And I've enjoyed some pretty grand dinners.)

I won't pretend to remember everything I ate but it did include an aparteif, app, wine, dessert, etc.  Nothing was skipped and every part of the meal was beyond words.

I particularly remember the service being several steps beyond what I had known to be \"good service\".  (When a team of staff come out and sync the placement of your table's plates?  Yeah, that is beyond good service).

Ambiance, as you can imagine, is something special.

No, this kind of dining is not about value so you'll need to save up for it.  But do treat yourself at least once in your lifetime.  Remember this place when you and your significant other have a special birthday or anniversary to celebrate."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved to come to this place during Chef Jason Bangerter time. Auberge du Pommier was a beautiful temple of French Food. Contemporary masterpieces like Truffle Soup and Pouched Lobster will be remembered forever by those who tried them. After Chef Bangerter's departure (moved to O&B Luma) Auberge du Pommier turned from French kitchen to international fusion and lost its elegance and style. When we visited this place couple of years ago we found some questionable innovations on menu like Macaroni&Cheese (as garnish). Since we were not so impressed by the food quality at that visit we stayed away of Auberge du Pommier until today. We hoped this place turned back to its French roots and went to Summerlisious dinner tonight. We had Watermelon Gazpacho and Fried Green Tomatoes for starters, Chicken Cordon Bleu and Salmon for mains and Fromage and Olive Oil Cake for dessert. We could not finish any of those dishes except cheese. All dishes were tasteless, all ingredients were mismatches, salmon had very fishy taste and smell, chicken was dry and not seasoned at all. This place still has a very romantic atmosphere, very nice elegant interior and a good service. But no more quality French food. We loved Auberge du Pommier and it was very sad to see what it became. We had a feeling like we lost a very good old friend who was sick for a long time and finally passed away."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for summer/winter-licious and a wedding party, but this was the first time coming here for regular dinner service. I remember this place being a lot better before and can't believe how bad it's gotten. Given the price point of this restaurant, I expected top notch service and food but was completely underwhelmed on both counts. 

For appetizers, we had:

- Flammekueche ($25) escargot, smoked lardons, onion, truffle, fromage frais. The escargot was already removed from the shell, but came cold and didn't taste fresh (maybe from frozen). The truffle was completely tasteless and not aromatic at all. All this comes in a little tart with cream that just doesn't go well with the escargot. The chef should go back to the drawing board on this one. Not recommended.

- Saint-Pierre ($29) John Dory fish, fennel, garlic, legumes, saffron fumet. The portion of the fish was decent for an appetizer, but for almost $30, I wouldn't expect anything less. The fish was cooked well, and its firm flesh was still moist. The decorations on the plate were done well with the fennel sprouted to give it the look of a John Dory. This was the only dish of the night that we thought was well executed and had a decent portion size.

For the main course, we had:

- Agneau ($48) rack of lamb, braised shoulder, cucumber raita, smoked aubergine, pomme maxim, sauce au chevre. The lamb was decent but nothing special. The potato ring is a nice touch, and the lamb went well with the cucumber raita. However, with only two pieces, the lamb portion is too small for a dinner entree. The braised shoulder was soft and tender, but the taste and smell weren't very appetizing. The beans look like it was added as an afterthought and other than adding a little colour to the dish, it didn't compliment the meat at all. Another dish that should be improved. 

- Cote de Boeuf ($58) beef rib eye steak, foraged mushrooms, leeks, smoked chou-fleur gratine, sauce poivrade. For this price, I was expecting a lot more than the 6 oz of meat I got, of which more than 1 oz of it was pure fat. The meat quality had a decent flavor and texture, but quite a bit of tendon made some parts chewy. Also, for $10/oz for a ribeye (not tenderloin), I was expecting something that would be on par with a high-end steakhouse - not even close! The minuscule portion they give you for the quality and cut of this meat by no means justifies this price. Also, on the menu it lists \"foraged\" mushrooms. I was expecting some exotic mushrooms, not two tiny slices of overcooked regular oyster mushrooms. Was very disappointed in this dish. 

For dessert, we had:

- Mont Blanc ($12) white chocolate and coconut bombe, chestnut, cranberry, yogurt sherbert. I have no idea what I ate, but it sure as heck wasn't a Mont Blanc. I didn't even taste a hint of chestnut. The cranberry overpowers all the other flavors and should be excluded. After having a real Mont Blanc at Cafe Boulud made by the Michelin starred NY pastry chef, nothing else comes close. But at least the Mont Blanc from places like Duo Patisserie and Ruelo tastes better. This one was just awful and would definitely avoid. 

The servers came by often to fill up our glasses. However, one cup came dirty and we had to ask for a new one. We also had to specifically ask for a steak knife. Do you really expect me to eat my $58 steak with a butter knife? Even at Denny's, they would give you a steak knife when you order the Steak & Eggs breakfast special! Our wine bottle still had some wine left and she only came by after we had already started coffee and desserts. She should have been attentive enough to top off our wine glasses during the entree service, especially since the wine bottle was not left on our table where we could help ourselves. At a restaurant of this class, the servers should be better trained.

The food quality has gone down significantly since my last couple of visits here. The portion of food they give is also ridiculously small. I have no issues paying top dollar for high-quality food, but this place gouges you for tiny portions of sub-standard food. Would much rather go to far superior French restaurants like Bacchanal or Cafe Du Boulud. This will be my last visit here..."}
{"text":"I enjoy the ambience here. I think that fact that this is considered O & B's crown jewel definitely shows. The food and customer service here is awesome. I favour French food so I may be biased but I enjoy the food here. I like the pace of dinning here, the servers don't generally rush you and they make you feel taken care of. It's a cosy and classy little ambience here too. I was here recently and it was delightful with the fireplaces lit."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, and yes again!

While they had the Summerlicious menu, we've decided to go all in, since it was my wife's birthday.

Every morsel was to be savoured, presentation was excellent, the service was as befits a good fine dining place - invisible.

They knew it was a birthday, and surprised us with a nice dessert, a candle, and a happy birthday greeting written on the dessert.

Will repeat, many times."}
{"text":"Came here for the Winterlicious lunch menu. Left quite disappointed. The service was undeniably slow, the entire lunch service taking just over 2 hours. The entrée, a beef hashé, was badly botched. Of the five guests at our table who ordered the hashé, the meat ranged from rare to well done even though it was all intended to be cooked one way. I'm not sure how this even happens. 

One of our guests waited 5 minutes for cutlery while the rest of the party ate. Eventually she had to get up and ask herself. It's surprising for this to happen at an expensive place that doubtlessly prides itself as a best-in-class service establishment. In all, a very disappointing $40 lunch. Maybe they just don't care about Winterlicious guests. Why take part, then?"}
{"text":"I've wanted to come to Auberge for the longest time and I was finally able to come in for a visit during Winterlicious! I really enjoyed the winter squash soup and the sea bass. They were delicious and cooked to perfection. The semifreddo and meringue dessert was also good but it lacked the wow factor for me. Service was quick but at times, we felt like we were forgotten by our servers (it took some time to get our waters refilled). Auberge is a must go - the food is great and the restaurant itself is beautiful."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant because of the raving reviews but unfortunately had a slightly different opinion then most of the other reviewers. We ordered 3 appetizers which included the foie gras, escargot tarte and porcini - all of which the taste were mediocre. Our halibut was over cooked and we had to send it back. 

To be fair we were impressed with the ambience and decor of the place and the patio where we seated at was lovely. However, the quality and taste of the food was much lower than our expectations and therefore 2 stars!"}
{"text":"Miss my days in France, sat down for a food excursion in an attempt to relive la vie. The service was on point. Had wonderful and friendly service that visited us just enough times to ensure we were taken care of, but not obsessively intrusive. Always had a smile to share which made the visit very enjoyable.
Now the food...as much as I wanted to love this place, I can't. Maybe I ordered the wrong dishes, maybe it was a stroke of bad luck for food these days, but the food was not enjoyable whatsoever. 
All I can say is hopefully next time will be better. If not, c'est la vie."}
{"text":"Thanks TO Summerlicious for existing and allowing me to try a classy french place like Auberge Du Pommier. My friend and I were able to try the $25 prix fixe lunch menu during Summerlicious, woohoo. 

We arrived early for our reservation...really early....like an hour early. They told us they couldn't seat us any earlier than our reservation time but did end up seating us about 10 minutes early, so after about 50 minutes of waiting. The hostesses were both completely gorgeous and dressed immaculately. 

I started my meal with the Strawberry Splash for $7 - a mix of lime & strawberry spirtz. We sat on the exquisite outdoor patio and this summer drink was the perfect refreshment - no free refills though. As we looked around waiting for our first course (and it was quite a wait!), I noticed that we were surrounded by senior citizen patrons. I'm not sure if this is their usual clientele or if it just so happened to be the audience on a late Wednesday lunch.

Auberge started us with the bread and that was just A-OK. A bit tough with some softness to it, I wasn't the biggest fan. I started with the Brandade Croquette over an argula salad. I enjoy this starter greatly as it was light yet filling for just a few bites. An excellent dish!

My main dish was the grilled lamb sausage with a crispy pita, fattoush salad and minted yogurt sauce. I honestly did not enjoy this dish. The flavor combinations sounded lovely on the menu but something just did not come together for this main.

Dessert was their version of an ice cream sandwich. Caramel semifreddo, cocoa nib and chocolate cake make up this slightly deconstructed ice cream sandwich. I expected to love this dish but just was not blown away. 

Our bill was $87 after tax, tip & a drink each. My suggestion to Auberge is to put a bit more thought into their Summerlicious menu & also let the servers know not to dismiss those dining & utilizing the prix fixe. I felt our waiter was not as attentive to our table as some of the others. This is your chance to snatch up new diners to your restaurant--- show off your skills during Summerlicious! The patio was absolutely magnificent and serene. That alone would draw me back to try the menu again."}
{"text":"We went for Winterlicious and again it was amazing.  Already have two more reservations for the spring.  They really do treat you like royalty and it would be impossible almost to find food as good."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant back in summer 2012 during the Summerlicious event.  My friend always wanted to try this place so we decided to give it a shot during summerlcious.  Before I begin, I must warn everyone that this place is expensive during regular nights, and which is why I came here during their $45 set dinner summerlcious menu.

The setting of this place is beautiful, they have their own little outdoor patio outside with covers to block off the sun and it also has a lot of greens around.  It makes you very relax while giving that very romantic feel. 

For the summerlicious menu, we ordered two set dinner to share and they included:
Peach Gazpacho - Appetizers
Shrimp Brochette - Appetizers

Mediterranean Seabass - Main
Filet Mignon - Main

Poppy Seed Shortcake - Dessert
Ice Cream Sandwich - Dessert

If the menu is still the same this summer, I would recommend choosing the Shrimp Brochette, Filet Mignon and Ice Cream Sandwich.  

The Filet Mignon was made to perfection, the meat melted right in my mouth.  The Ice Cream Sandwich had very strong chocolate taste and surprisingly, it was not too sweet and was perfect for me as I tend to dislike desserts that are too sweet.

If you are having trouble debating which restaurants to try out during this year's summerlicious, I highly recommend you to pay the premium and go to Auberge Du Pommier!"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to try Auberge du Pommier thanks to the Summerlicious promotion and can say that I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. It will definitely take a bite out of your wallet, with most meals coming in at around $50, however it is well worth it if you feel like splurging. The restaurant is very elegantly decorated and feels classy without being overbearing. My meal consisted of a pork croquette, strip loin, and a chocolat (mousse-esqe dessert). The croquette was a very nice texture, and was served with a nice sauce and sauerkraut. The strip loin was cooked accurately to the requested temperature and was on par with those you would have at a nice steakhouse. Lastly, as someone who does not love desserts I would pleasantly surprised by the chocolat, as I found it was not too sweet but still fulfilled that chocolaty craving. Overall, I had a great experience and would certainly return."}
{"text":"Auberge is the best French restaurant I've eaten at. The service was excellent and servers were very courteous and attentive. I had the beet salad, pasta with smoked salami, Sirloin steak w/ roast potatoes and creme brûlée. All dishes were warm and well seasoned. 

The restaurant itself is very nicely decorated and secluded which makes it great for a quiet night out with your significant other. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Post-dating back to Summerlicious '10, Auberge Du Pommier presents itself like a house on the French Countryside. Auberge is a lot more spacious than what it appears outside. The inside of the restaurant is gorgeous, with a combination of a rustic, classy, intimate, and refined feeling. Inside are stone walls with sconces, candlelight and a large fireplace in the back. After my first experience here, it has become one of my favourite O & B restaurants to come back to. 

Came here for lunch, celebrating three birthdays at once.

Ordered:

Appetizer:
Brandade de Morue - It came with a delicate cod brandard (salted cod), which is traditionally paired with a toasted French baguette. The cod was surprisingly creamy and smooth, a refreshing appetizer.

Entree:
Poulet Rôti, Fricassée de Saison - Roasted chicken nestled on a broth consisted of wild mushroom cream, beans, and corn. The chicken captured the natural creaminess and sweetness from the mushroom and corn, making each bite moist and savoury. The highlight of my Summerlicious experience here.

Dessert:
Cake au Citron - The cake was fluffy and sofy, though the sourness from the lemon was too strong to enjoy. 

Service here was impeccable and spot on. The waitress made her presence known and accompanied any requests quickly with my table of 9. I mentioned on the phone while I was booking that I was celebrating 3 birthdays, she took me aside and secretly took note of which guests she would be bringing out the desserts with candles for.

I will definitely be back on a regular night.

Note: Underground parking is free when you have your parking ticket validated after your meal."}
{"text":"Coming here for Winterlicious it's tough because it's among the popular places to book. 
Off the bat! the service from the door to the table was superb, beyond my expectations since this place has a reputation to preserve. 
The ambiance is clean, contemporary and most of all 'romantic' with three separate dining areas and the added green room, which is used as their patio section during summer months. 

For starters I tried their Squash bisque served with shellfish seafood, this was a hearty soup that's worth ordering.

Main I had their braised beef served with vegetable roots with a beautiful smoked butter puree. Presentation was lovely and the dish looked as good as it tasted, but it didn't WOW me!

For dessert I tried their salted chocolate served with crushed cashew drizzled over it. 

Overall the place is great! the service is EXCELLENT, their food met my expectation but didn't WOW me.

Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Food: 4/5"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype. The best restaurant I've been to outside of downtown. The menu constantly changes, but if you see the watermelon lobster appetizer, go for it! 

Obviously, it's on the pricier side, but perfect  for any special occasion. We reserved for 6pm on a weekday, so it was quiet and the service was excellent. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went for their first day of summerlicious 2010.

The first courses and amuse bouche were amazing. Tried the pea soup to start. Perfect ten. 

The mains were a disappointing. The tuna smelt of chorizo sausage and the tastes on the plate were off balance: too much sweet and soft. I wish that there could have been something crunchy and refreshing on the plate to balance it out... and the oils were explained by the server as \"green oil and tomato oil\".

The cheese to finish was perfect - bit at the tongue in just the right way, and a great texture. The wine was their rose, priced well in the low $40s and absolutely yummy. 

The maitre d' also blew me away -- he goes out of his way to get to know each guest by name. And his wife of 27 yrs is also polish :)"}
{"text":"We came last Sunday for Summerlicious brunch. The service was top notch, at least 4-5 different people \"served\" us. We had Croquette, Sea Bass and Ice Cream Sandwich chocolate cake. They were all delicious and looked very artistic.
Can't beat the French for fine dining ;)
Thanks to Summerlicious we can afford to come here and found this gem. Nice interior decor too."}
{"text":"A perfect place for a date.

I came here for Summerlicious, just over the weekend and I thought it was one of those places that you'd love to take your date to. It's cute,  cozy, it was quiet enough that you can still hear your conversation.

The service was phenomenal. Usually most Summerlicious restaurants the server would rush you to order and avoid coming by to fill your glasses of water so you wouldn't talk as much, but I had a great experience here where the server didn't want to rush us and told us to take our time with the menu and wine list. Water was refilled frequently. The \"bread server\" was very polite and was more than happy to explain to us what type of bread he had at hand.

I don't think there was anything wildly out of the ordinary with the food. It's French, I expect a lot. I loved the little treats they offered before and after the 3-course meal. As a pre-appetizer, I had this cute one-bite cheese quiche... if I had more I think my arteries would clog, but it's sooo tasty. And for a post-dessert, I had this one-bite dark chocolate 'brownie' that was super light that looked like moose dropping candy. Out of this year's Summerlicious menu I really liked the Green Pea soup with seafood. It's so light and refreshing. Perfect for a hot summer day or night with a hint of mint. I ordered the Beef Medallion on caramelized onions and mashed potatoes... the beef was perfect!

I was initially worried about the portion, but it was perfect with a glass of wine and bread. I wouldn't mind coming back to try out their regular menu."}
{"text":"First time we were there and tried their regular menu which was pretty good. But this time we came during summerlicious and i feel like it was much worse. 
I got a salad, steak and chocolate mousse for dessert. Presentation was good, but it terms of taste everything was just alright, but not good. I ordered my steak medium rare, but they made it almost well done. Salad and dessert were just okay, nothing special. 
From a fine dining place Id expect a little bit more. I mean yes, they do have beautiful decor and very polite servers, but I feel like the quality of their food isn't at that level."}
{"text":"I went here last October for a family gathering to celebrate my Uncle's life.  This is my aunt's absolute favourite restaurant.

We had a customized menu, of which I had the fortune to try the Chou Frise, Salmon, Beef (from my daughter's plate) and Tarte Frangipane and Mousse au Chocolate (again, from my daughter's plate).

Everything was absolutely delicious.  

I have taken away one star, only because of the $$$ (although I know it was worth it, they could make it slightly more reasonable), and the parking issue.  I paid $30 for parking only to find out weeks later from my aunt that they validate parking.  Really?  The hostess could have advised us on our arrival."}
{"text":"We had three appetizers and an entree and split it between the 2 of us. It was plenty of food and everything was delicious. Would highly recommend for special occasions."}
{"text":"The service was bad, the atmosphere was chaotic, lighting is a bit off, there was no vibe, my seat was awkward, was not what I expected from a restaurant at this level. 

Came here last year, had foies gras, lobster bisque for appetizer. Rabbit and forgot the other dish for main. Rabbit was salty, there was nothing special about any of the dishes we had, nor do I think they tasted good (except foie gras I always love foie gras). Needless to say, we did not venture to have any dessert. 

Was not worth $300~ without drink for such a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious Lunch a few months back.  It was a pretty good portion meal as well as it was an experience that you would definitely remember for life.  A must for anyone who is a foodie or just wants to experience fine french food.  Parking was easy and restaurant was easy enough to find. Waiters and Waitresses were nice and easy to talk to.  Also, the environment was a beauty and just astonishing.  There is also a lot of wine to choose from and a few fruit drinks that we tried and it was just as good as the food.  

Food came fast as well as we came for lunch and there was not that many people so I had to admit it felt pretty nice to have the whole venue to ourselves.  While portions look small, the food is actually really filling and it was enough to ensure I was not hungry afterwards.  I tried the beef roast that they have and it was quite amazing."}
{"text":"I've been doing some neighbourhood food and restaurant research for the past while and Auberge Du Pommier kept popping up at the top of the list. When I saw it on the list of restaurants participating in Summerlicious, I just had to give it a try. 

I made a reservation to have lunch there with my boyfriend. Getting to the area was easy since it's almost right by the highway. However, we almost missed turning into that plaze since it was somewhat hidden. Even after getting in, we made several loops around as we couldn't find the entrance to the restaurant. Turns out, it was right in the middle of the loop but just that the restaurant signs were so apparent. 

When we finally got to the restaurant, it was great! The service was awesome, it had a great atmosphere and I absolutely loved the gentle music in the background. We sat outside at the patio since it was such a nice day. We took out time and enjoyed the lunch course meal and it was delicious and pleasently presented.

I would love to go back once in a while, but likely for special occasions, as it is quite pricey."}
{"text":"One of the few high end  *licious participants that doesn't do it on auto pilot. Lots been said about d'Auberge Du Pommier. Great service, great food, etc. The bathrooms are a bit of a let down. Not a  truck stop horror show. But there's something nice about slipping into a really nice washroom. 

The best part: bread here appears to not be a finite resource. As quickly as you clear the fluffy morning buns off the plate, they bring you more. I'm guessing each bun has a small RFID tag cooked into it so they immediately know when the bun has moved off plate. 

As noted, parking is steep. We paid about $8.50 for a Sunday lunch. This place isn't far from a subway station so there are options."}
{"text":"To get things in perspective, I went on the first day of Winterlicious.  I figured I haven't been here before and wanted to give it a go.

Upon entry, it's probably the nicest place I've ever seen.  Really, it's such a nice looking restaurant.  Kinda reminds me of a inn in paris.  It's got wood burning fireplaces, and intimate seating with white painted walls which seem very rustic (at least if rustic was classy).

I wasn't really expecting a crazy menu, it is winterlicious after all.  I got the goat cheese puff pastry, the beef (not sure what it was called), and the cheese plate.  I also got the wine paring with it... why not?

First thing that came was the wine.  Kinda thought it was weird because it came quite a bit before the puff pastry salad, and since it was a white, it was supposed to be kinda chilled \"while\" i was eating the appetizer.  Anyways, I didn't fid it a big deal because I figured they were rammed because of Winterlicious.  

The puff pastry goat cheese plate wasn't that special in my opinion.  It was a slice of puff pastry, with a bit of goat cheese in the middle with goat cheese on top.  After that it was dressed with a lemon vinaigrette and some mixed greens.  Taste-wise... meh, not too impressive.  It did go with the wine nicely though =).

The beef that came out was a little interesting.  it came sitting on a bed of barely with a Bok Choy beside it.  I noticed that the beef had kinda been \"warming\" for a while because of how it tasted.  I have a feeling they had these on standby because they were kinda dry on the outside.  At least it was done to a medium rare... (they didn't ask me how I wanted it BTW).  I think out of everything this was probably my favourite.

I also tried my girlfriend's Coq Au Vin, and I found it kinda bland.  I know when I make it, the chicken tastes like it was marinated in red wine.  This was quite the opposite, kinda tasted like the chicken wasn't even cooked in the wine very long (had no flavour to it).

The cheese was pretty pathetic.  It was 3 slices of white cheddar... but to make it look a little bit better they put 2 slices of crustini in between to make it look pretty.  Not too impressed.

All in all, I think the keyword of the night is un-imaginative.  Sure I can say that most french cuisine is quite similar and hard to categorize, but I didn't really see anything that special for a place that should have blown my mind.

Consider my mind intact and un-blown.  Maybe I'll try it again on a non-licious night."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Best restaurant for any special occasion, in other words, this is not your average restaurant. Everything about the restaurant reeks of quality service."}

{"text":"This restaurant has been on my list for the longest time. So glad I came here for my birthday. 

Parking was easy enough. You park underground and bring the ticket to be validated by the front desk.

The hostess greeted us warmly, took our jackets, and lead us to our table. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with elegant decor.

We decided not to do the tasting menu because we wanted to try certain dishes. 

The menu: 

Cocktail: Fait ta Valise: this was a sweet drink. I liked it! A

Foie gras: very good! The foie gras was nicely prepared with a wonderful sauce. It was sweet yet savoury. One of my fave dishes here. A+

Tartare: this was just ok. The beef didn't have much taste and the dish itself didn't have a wow factor. B

Arctic char: a recommendation from our server. It was very good. The meat was very soft, smooth, and flavourful. The skin was crispy. But, this dish wasn't anything special. A-

Lamb: this was our favourite part of the menu. The lamb was tender, juicy, and flavourful! We got it rare and it was fabulous. A+

Soufflé - this took 20 minutes to make, but was well worth the wait. The waiter came with it and poured the apple sauce in front of me. It was made in a cast iron mini pot, which helped it retain its crispness on the outside area, but it was so soft and fluffy on the inside. It was one of the best soufflé I've had!

We paid the bill and was about to leave, and got a little trio of cookies. It was a nice end to the dining experience. We were so stuffed! 

Just some notes: the servers were super attentive. They made sure our water was always full and came around several times to ask if we needed bread. Each dish is spread apart giving people time to digest and enjoy themselves. Give yourself at least 2 hours for 5 dishes (2 people). I loved the attention of the staff. They separated two portions of our mains because we were sharing. A very nice way to put in the extra mile. The server also put a candle and happy birthday on the dessert because my partner mentioned it was for my birthday. It was very sweet!"}
{"text":"Auberge du Pommier used to be my favourite restaurant in Toronto.

But over the years the quality has slid. It's still good, but not anywhere as good as it used to be.

Sometimes it is still excellent. Maybe around 20% of the time.  Service is still great, but the food is slipping.

So when you go it can be an inconsistent experience.

I think their decline is correlated with their participation in Summerlicious.

I wish they did not do Summerlicious. That program encourages them to make a lot of dishes to a low price point with too many compromises. The thought process behind these types of Summerlicious compromises don't seem to end when Summerlicious ends. I think they are trying to make cheaper, less sophisticated, French food for more masses.

When they started doing Summerlicious they produced some great and memorable dishes. But over the last 2-3 years whey they serve for Summerlicious is 'nice' but hardly comparable to previous efforts.

I remember they once served a simple salad with a wonderful jewel-like raddish. I took a photo of the raddish. It was so delicious I can still taste it in my memory years later.

I remember many lavish meals with different groups of friends and they all, for years, would exclaim it's the best food they'd eaten. Now when I bring new groups there to introduce them to (hopefully) great French cooking the opinions are mixed, and only excellent about 20% of the time.

I hope they re-evaluate where they are going and work to turn themselves around.

Toronto needs what they used to be."}
{"text":"Typically this is one of the best restaurants in the city. I've visited several times and it's everything I was expecting and more.

That being said, the recent winterlicious was very underwhelming. They were woefully understaffed, the tables were shoddy and wobbly, and the dinner was decent at best... given the tier of the restaurant.  

You get what you pay for I guess."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for winterlicious. We loved the food and atmosphere. However our server was pretty lack lustre. He didn't introduce himself, kept pressing us if we wanted drinks and managed to only fill 2 of the cups with water while there were 4 people seated. 

The whole night the server looked like he ate shit and somehow didn't even bother to offer a smile throughout the duration of the dinner. Only near the dessert did he pop out to ask if we wanted coffee. Like come on.. we're practically done dessert.. He basically only served the table who ordered alcohol on top of the meals. Bad server but highly recommend the food and atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Today bf and I had lunch here. It's the summerlicious menu. We both ordered the same thing. Chicken terrine, pork and Mille feuille. 
Somehow their previous winter/summerlicious menu didn't appeal to me but this year seems to be ok... And I've heard all the good things about it so glad that we finally had a chance to visit

First the chicken terrine
I don't know.... I thought terrine would be creamy? This one is somehow like chicken spam..... You have chunks of chicken pieces and it's quite salty
The two pieces of baguette were very hard and crunchy 
But the grassy green sauce went well with the terrine 
I think this dish is average 

For the main course it's the pork with ratatouille, grilled zucchini and potato
It's not bad. Pork was a little bit try but it's better if you dip it back to the meat juice or the ratatouille 

Dessert was Mille feuille. The other two, one wa Melon soup and one was cheese.... So that's really the only option
Hummmm it's not quite what I expected to see.... It's a dissembled Mille feuille with chocolate and blueberry at the bottom.... The pastry was very thin and crispy, to a point that it can scratch your mouth.... But it tasted good. I kinda mixed it up a bit so that it's easier to eat....

Overall service was good, food was ok but can be better, portion was big, worth the $30"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with the wife and mom and it was a great experience. Food was good despite it being winterlicious.  Service was great as well.

However it wasn't a homerun as I had expected more. 

Will be back .."}
{"text":"We had wanted to visit Auberge last year during Summerlicious but everything was booked up as they are closed on Sundays for weddings, but managed to nab a reservation this year. The restaurant isn't too noticeable from the street, nor does it have free parking. However, I fell in love once I stepped into the restaurant. Its décor is beautiful, with a darling European style and beautiful patio. Despite being quite busy, the tables are spaced out far enough that it doesn't get very loud or crammed. The servers were kind and attentive, and I felt very welcome. 

From the fixed $28 lunch menu, I chose
1 | SOUPE (vegetarian)
Summer Fruit & Melon Gazpacho, Toasted Croissant, Peppered Sheep's Yoghurt & Olive Oil
2 | SAUMON
Pan-Roasted Atlantic Salmon, Fennel, Écrasée de Pomme & Caper Chili Sauce Vierge
3 | CHOCOLAT 
Chocolate Crémeux, Coffee Crumble, Cacao Tuile & Mint White Chocolate Ice Cream

Everything tasted fantastic. My favourite item was probably the entrée, which had a lovely combination of items to compliment the salmon. I sampled my friend's terrine appetizer, which also tasted great. Portions were on the smaller side, but at such an affordable price and high quality, I could not complain. I absolutely enjoyed my Summerlicious experience at Auberge."}
{"text":"Our go-to dinner place to celebrate special occasions. Yes the food is expensive but you get high quality, taste and service  I like the foie gras appetizer, braised beef entree and souffle dessert. My husband enjoys their seafood offerings too. Creative French influenced cuisine at a beautiful dining area and thoughtful service."}
{"text":"Not recommended:  slow service, poor wine, good food, bad value.  

For $200 per person, I expect something wonderful.  This was not.  Not even close.

Our table consisted of 2 vegans, one almost-vegetarian, 1 omnivore, and 2 kids.  None of us left happy.

The meal took 4 hours -- about 1.5 hours longer than it should have.  It was a full 2 hours before the first course was served.  I sat for over 1/2 hour with an empty glass of water.

When I made the reservation, I asked whether the Menu Potager was vegan -- the online menu listed no egg/dairy ingredients, but I know how much the French love their butter.  They said it wasn't, but that they could \"amend it\" to make it so and would let the chef know we were coming.  However, when arriving I had to argue with the waitress and wait forever for her to consult with the kitchen before it was approved.

The \"amendments\" turned out to really just be subtractions rather than substitutions.

The almost-vegetarian told the waitress that she would go with the vegan version instead of the vegetarian version if it would be easier for the kitchen.  She was told \"no, you should go with the vegetarian version because we have to remove so much for the vegan option you won't like it\".  She now wishes she had gone with it anyway as her version was way too rich for her liking.

I disliked 1/2 the wines served with the Wine Pairing add-on.  The other half were just ok.  Also, no effort was made to adjust the pairings for the vegan menu.

They have a rule that the entire table must participate if choosing one of the 5 course meal options.  This was not mentioned in their online menu or when I made the reservation.  We were there with a couple kids who cannot eat that much.  Again we had to wait for special permission from the kitchen to get the rule waived.

Wine to food ratio was too high.  Because the food portions were small and the service so slow, we ended up drinking way too much -- of wine that wasn't very good.

Some of the staff was very friendly and helpful, but not all.

About 75 min in, they brought a couple pieces of bread to the table, but didn't indicate if it was vegan.  The Sweetie went with \"don't ask, don't tell\".  I abstained, wrongly figuring food would be coming soon.

Food was good, but nobody thought anything was exceptional, although some of the individual ingredients stood out as above average, hence 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"So me and my wife went to this place as our 2 years anniversary and let me tell you, while we are in the middle of an divorce, this place blew our mind.  Everything is exceptional, from the food, to the presentation, to the service.  Absolutely on point 100%.  It melt our icy heart and created an unforgettable romantic dinner that only 2 people in love could truly experience.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been here 2x. Both times, my mouth had a little party, because the food was so good.

When I took my first taste of their mushroom soup, I thought, \"this may be one of the best, if not THE best, soups I've ever tasted in my life.\" Just as I was thinking this, someone else in my party actually said these very words.

Salmon treated delicately, not overdone. Steak (medium rare) done perfectly. The mains were delicious, but was it the best food I've ever had in my life? Objectively, not really. Let's just say that it was on par with what I expected from a restaurant of this quality.

Service was fantastic.

Price: Prepare to sell a kidney.

Unless you are flush, you should probably not eat here unless you are going to propose to your S.O. soon."}
{"text":"I went here one time for my cousin's wedding party. I'm not a fan of French food, but they were able to accommodate the kids with some nice pasta! I had the pasta too. It's a really nice atmosphere and the staff talk to you and are friendly. It's really expensive, so maybe go here on a very special occasion. Dress nicely too. I recommend this to people who like French cuisine and enjoy a great dining experience."}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment. I figure that the rave reviews come from people who live far out and do not have easy access to better places in town, or because it is not located near any serious competition.

From the outside (as well as the reviews and the gracious hostesses) this place looks quite charming. And, to its credit, it has been around 25 years. 

Here are the challenges I encountered....

1. First of all, this is perhaps the most expensive place in town. That is not bad in itself. I like to eat well. When you can be more expensive than everyone and still bring them in, good for you.

2. Parking is a bit of a mystery. There is no valet. In the closest spaces there are \"Authorized Parking Only\" signs everywhere. Well, you are supposed to know to park in the basement of the deck across from the place.

3. The service was poor, and considering the hype of this place, it was really much worse than that. We were seated in a side room. There were six other tables (besides ours) occupied and one was an eight top. All guests were served by only one waiter!  There was not even a busboy. The waiter was scurrying around refilling water glasses, clearing plates, etc. This might be ok at Wendy's, but it wasn't working here. Besides the one waiter, we were humored by others on staff who raced in and out of the room resetting tables, rearranging, and putting out new linens. It was all completely frantic and unsettling. We finally just had to laugh at it, not knowing if the joke was on us. Especially watching the wait staff roll their eyes and jabber at each other as if no one could see or hear them. The one waiter, who nervously kept running his fingers through his hair, could've used their help, but they were clearly not ready for prime time.

4. The food was not very good for the money, or really if it had been free.  There was no amuse bouche. The 48$ steak had little to no flavor and came out medium, not rare as ordered.  It was served with mushrooms that were delicious. The steak tartare was a jumbled mess and at 22$, 5$ more than the delicious tartare at Scaramouche.  I was not offered a choice of temperature on my 42$ tuna. It was overcooked and served with octopus that tasted more like a sugarless gummy worm. Even determined to eat my expensive meal, i could not eat it, and I usually like octopus.  The \"Chinese broccoli\" was the best thing on the plate, and i do not tend to like oily wilted greens. The pomme de terre app was the best of the dishes. The potato had no flavor, but the dish as a whole was well-plated and had nice texture to it.

5. The cocktails and the table bread were the best parts of the dining experience.  The Smoky Manhattan, as well as the Southern Roots, were very nice, well-balanced drinks.

I imagine if I had been a regular (and sworn not to order from the very pedestrian looking Winterlicious Menu) I might've been seated in the much nicer main dining room, which might have helped avoid the service train wreck I experienced. Either way, the food still was not befitting of a place of such reputation.

I have been to places that I felt deserved a second chance. Not so sure here."}
{"text":"Luxury dining for the finest of Toronto. 

I was treated to a wonderful lunch at this hidden gem during a weekday. 

As soon as you walk in and are being chaperoned to your table, you know you have walked into one of the finest restaurants the city has to offer. 

The feel of the place is very European. As you walk past the tables you can see that the clients who dine there are of the affluent crowd. Or so they seem based on their attire and demeanour. 

Once seated outside, it started to rain but this place is fully equipped with a retractable roof overhead. Nice touch to the typical fabric roof that leaks on the sides or in between. The atmosphere outside was just as beautiful but with much more greenery and a water fountain. 

I decided to order a Romaine salad with a Poulet for my entree. 

The Poulet was juicy and tender on the inside and well cooked on the outside. 
The salad was a salad, with nothing extra special on it for my taste buds. 

Everything was beautiful and the service was great but when it came time for my dessert, the creme brûlée, there was an issue with it. 
I immediately let the waitress aware of it and she tried to correct it right away. 
Soon enough the manager came to our table and apologized for not having the full 5 star treatment. 

Being part of the Oliver and Bonacini brand I would expect 5 stars all the way and that everything is dbl and triple checked before being served or displayed. 
However I will commend them on how soon they reacted in order to correct their errors. This is why they are still receiving 3 stars.  Quality service goes a long way. 

Doubtful if I will be back anytime soon but it was a beautiful setting with some friendly staff. One assistant server would never smile or talk."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch for the summerlicious.  They seem to be prepared with the expected higher volume.  So the food came out fast.  The service was good.  The food were delicious.  When the meal came out, I wish the portion is a little bigger.  But after the 3-course, I was full (and not overly stuffed).  The chicken is a little bit dry.  Maybe because it's white meat.  Other than that, everything is yummy.  The decor is nice too.  $25 for 3-course meal (summerlicious fixed prix).  Good deal."}
{"text":"I've only been here once (since it's kind of far from where I live) and I loved it. The food tasted heavenly and the service was amazing. it's also very accessible since it's located next to a parking lot. try the desserts they're amazing."}
{"text":"My family of 5 went for summerlicious dinner last week, my second time there. When we called the restaurant said they didn't have any spots but when we went there they seated us on the patio, which is covered and quite nice. The food was mediocre consisting of overcooked mini-quiches for the amuse bouche (which came out twice due to an error in the kitchen - they said they had a new system that was screwing everything up) and mains that were nothing to write home about, I barely remember what we even had. What I do remember very clearly is that it took us TWO HOURS from start to finish and we would have felt unattended if it wasn't for the man with bread who kept coming around to our table. 

The first time we went last year we were impressed with everything, the service was impeccable and the food was delicious. After this visit however we probably won't go back again."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you go that you wish Yelp had multiple ratings for multiple experiences, such as food, service, abidance and environment. 

Food fantastic (5/5), apps prices anywhere from $10 to $30, mains priced anywhere from $20-$45. Martini's $12. 

We ordered a few cocktails, I had a Chopin martini which was done to perfection, not watery, poured at the table, olives tasty. In fact, I asked if I they had any stuffed Olives, which the reply was \"no, but let me go get the bartender to make you some, it will take a bit longer, but we can see what we can do\". I thought that was nice, rather than the normal, \"no\" you get. In the end they didn't have any pitted olives so they could do it, and I didn't mind at all, it was nice they tried. My wife had a Cosmo, which is her favorite and she said it was pretty good. 


The chef sent out a \"amuse bouche\" which was a delicious parsnip soup with french olive oil. I love the amuse bouche when it is done right, and it was done right here.  

For apps I ordered the Foie Gras ( who wouldn't?), it was perfect, not the best i ever had, but tied with all the best Foie Gras dishes I've had! It was really good. There were four components on the plate, all of which went very well with the Foie Gras and also went well with each other, the chef clearly is a master of flavours. My wife ordered the warm goat cheese. It was delicious and had many components on the plate, none competing, all working together. 

For my main, I ordered the Tuna two ways, seared and tartar. Thinking I'd be getting two different tastes, (which I did), I was also amazed at how the chili oil, went with both the Tartar and the seared. Interestingly enough, the tartar was wrapped in a thin grilled pineapple, and served on a bed of fresh peas. Now, peas, Pineapple and tuna? Huh? Let me tell you, amazing together, really nice combination. This chef knows flavours and what goes together. 

My wife ordered the beef filet that came with potato and mushroom crochettes. Again, amazing all of it. about four components on the plate, all working well together, at the end my wife discovered the truffle oil on the plate..... a nice surprise. 

We did not have dessert, but they looked pretty nice. 

The portion size is perfect, my wife was feeling pretty full, (the steak was pretty big), but I was feeling perfect. Its important to note, we'd lick the plates if we were at home eating like this, but the plates were cleaned right off the polite way. 

Some things to note:

1. The wine list is extensive, although we didn't have any due to driving, I really liked they had many by the glass selections and also many half bottles. This is rare in Toronto, and is a nice touch for those not wanting to drink a whole bottle but still have a nice wine. The wine list is also not obnoxious like some places, like having a $10,000 bottle of wine on the list, there are some $950, but not many. If you like french and Italian wines and want a good selection, they have a nice selection. I spent 15 minutes pouring over it. 

2. Parking is free, park underground, keep your ticket to be validated. Not having to search and search and search for a parking spot was nice. 

3. Its a bit of an older crowd I think ( i was only there one night, during the week as well so perhaps this night, but they still have Caesar Salad and Steak on the menu.....). If I'm right just go there and ignore the old folks and enjoy the food. 

The night was not perfect, service was slightly slow here and there and we felt unattended to a few times, but nothing serious and nothing that really irritated us. Another thing was, the apps were cleared and our mains were in front of us in seconds..... personally I prefer to sit back and remember the loveliness of what I just ate before diving right into the next course.  A timing issue, but not a big deal, enough to lose a star as I would give service a 4/5 because of it, but the other categories overcome and rounding up makes my rating a 5/5."}
{"text":"Auberge du Pommier is a fantastic venue for hosting a wedding.  The restaurant is available for buyouts on Sundays with a minimum spend.  It was the perfect location for my vision of a small and intimate wedding.  The venue has so much character and the decor is stunning. There is a lovely patio with a lot of seating, a fountain, greenery and it could be covered in case it rains!  There is a room for dancing - it's connected to the patio and the dining room.  There is another room you can use as a bridal suite; We used it for a Chinese tea ceremony.  Another bonus is the free underground parking available for your guests!

Coordinator
The restaurant coordinator and junior coordinator were so helpful and answered any questions we had promptly.  When we had our formal meeting before the wedding, the coordinator helped us with details and made a lot of suggestions!  The cake stand and vases for the  bouquets were provided and you are able to use all the decor the venue has as well!  The coordinator helped us plan out our evening, suggested having our first dance outside on the patio, helped us with our scheduling, and provided a great estimated wedding cost.  She prepared a detailed itinerary of the night which was just fantastic- every detail is covered!

Food/drink selections
There are different menu options you can choose from.  Each menus includes an appetizer, main and desert. The great thing is your guests can choose their meal at the wedding! A menu is printed for each guest (personalized with bride/groom  names and date) -Great detail :)  We added the hor d'ourves during cocktail hour- $10.00 per person for three hor d'ourves.  I absolutely recommend these-they were delicious creations and not typical options like other wedding halls.  For late night snacks we selected grilled cheese mini sandwiches - these were $3.50 each and they were actually quite tiny.  I wish I had ordered more, because they were great but just too small for the cost.  The quality and presentation of the app, dinner, desert is excellent!  The drinks are charged per drink - you can help keep the costs down by giving limitations on what's served.  Overall, the cost was less than we expected and the coordinators estimate was very close.  You pay your wedding bill estimate in full before the wedding;  if there is a credit or debit, they will charge/refund your credit card after the wedding.

Service
The waiters are top notch, professional, pleasant and efficient. I was so pleased by the experienced wait staff- the service is much more elevated than what you get at a typical wedding hall.  My husband and I had a delightful waitress who saved hor dourves for us and always checked to make sure everything was okay."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious dinner on the first night of it! My friend recommended it to me and it seems one cannot go wrong with Oliver&Bonacini restaurants. A fantastic experience- the ambience as fancy yet comfortable as I expected it to be, the service from the hostess to the server at our table was warm and welcoming and above all, the food! 

What I ordered: I had the white bean veloute for appetizer, roasted squash tart for my main course and chocolate brioche for dessert.

I was nervous about the choice because it wouldn't seem as though the roasted squash tart would be a popular choice, but it did not disappoint! The red and white wine were spectacular, had half a bottle each with my friend. Tea afterwards was good to get rid of the alcohol, I ordered decaffeinated English breakfast tea and the teapot was pretty and had lots of tea in it for refill.

I liked the complimentary appetizer and dessert, the appetizer being rosemary bread with artichoke puree and the dessert being coconut macaroons. Overally, it was very pricey but worth it. It was my first time and I would definitely come here again, it is lovely for an occasion and represents Toronto's Winterlicious well."}
{"text":"The restaurant was beautiful, the service was impeccable, and the food surpassed my expectations. I tried the tasting menu, and every course was delicious. We were seated outdoors in their patio, next to a little cherub sculpture. The restaurant is located near office buildings and seems a little misplaced at first sight, but you don't notice at all inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Please note this review is for the winterlicious only. I'm sure regular meals would be a completely different experience! I came for lunch on a Sunday and noticed they only had the winterlicious menu (I believe it is usually closed on Sundays so they were open just for winterlicious). The service as usual was on par with other o&b restaurants. My issue was more with the food. Perhaps I expected much more based on the price point and the reputation I have been hearing. The issue I had was that the food felt precooked (I suppose inevitable in these types of events), portions were on the smaller side and the taste was just average. Hence the average rating. Of the 6 dishes I tried, only the salmon stood out to me. I may come back to try another day but definitely avoid winterlicious or other licious events!"}
{"text":"Was here last May I believe for my friends wedding. Its a lovely little restaurant located right off of Yonge street.

Very friendly and attentive staff. The food was excellent as well as the presentation. Its definitely a nice little cozy place to get married at. The food was excellent compared to a regular banquet hall for a wedding, and this place would rank pretty high up there for a nicer restaurant to get married at (Canoe is another one that comes to mind).

Tough to really give a review on the pros and cons when most of the experience went very well. I guess I am left a little bit without words? Again the service and food was excellent, the only negative I can comment on is the environment, but for what its worth this place would make a great little place to have a date."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food!  Been here a few times and each time I am impressed.  This is one of those well known high end restaurants that actually lives up to its reputation.  Had their steak and it was on par with the best steakhouses out there."}
{"text":"Celebrated an anniversary and had the desire for French cooking. Nice to have high quality dining without going downtown for it. Impeccable service, expert kitchen, beautiful decor. Had the foie gras, seared scallops, halibut, and duck breast, all excellently prepared. Brought our own champagne, but they also have a very good wine list."}
{"text":"Auberge du Pommier describes itself as having  \"elevated French cuisine, inspired service and sophisticated French country decor\". I think this description is spot on. Going to Auberge du Pommier is truly an escape from the city.

I went there with my fiance right before our 2nd trip to France and this meal was the perfect send-off. I vividly remember how serenely beautiful and classy the terrace was. The food was highly reminiscent of upscale French cuisine in Paris, and was designed to delight all your senses.

Make sure to take your special someone here."}
{"text":"Came here on the last day of winterlicious for lunch on a Thursday. We reserved for two people at 2:30pm. There's paid underground parking (paid around $11 for over 2 hours) with a staircase that leads to the restaurant. When we arrived, we had to wait even though we reserved. We had our coats checked in and weren't seated until like 3pm...

Food was generally pretty good- up until the dessert. There's a serving of bread and butter to start. For my meal, I had the terrine, saumon and parfait. Here's a breakdown of my review:

Terrine (heritage chicken, leek, pickled turnip, sweet potato, lentil vinaigrette) - This was good and very filling like a main. The chicken was very compact, kind of like a sausage even. The ingredients go well together, I enjoyed the bits of turnip which made it more refreshing. The sweet potato was also like chips and it was sweet and crispy. Chicken can be dry at times but this was well-done.

Saumon (citrus-crusted salmon, rapini, smoky mustard, creamy polenta, caper lemon cream) - Hands-down the best salmon I've ever had. I'm a salmon lover so you can trust me on this haha. Super tender (I was amazed), slight crunch on the top, and I particularly LOVED the creamy polenta. This is like a type of cornmeal porridge, I've never had it as a dressing- very creative and new to me. If I had to be picky though, the rapini was a bit too burnt to my liking (which made it more bitter), and there were too many capers (refreshing but super salty lol). This was very filling.

Parfait (blood orange parfait, buttermilk gelee, biscuit crumb, mandarin ice cream) - A bad way to end the meal tbh. I have a sweet-tooth and I'm a sweet over savoury person. This was way too sweet. Also, the mandarin ice cream was more like a sorbet (not a fan of sorbets). There was also a meringue topping which was refreshing because there was some dried lime powder sprinkled on top (?) but very sweet. I did enjoy the buttermilk gelee so more of that would've been nice. That's because I like creamy things too though. Maybe I should've had the tarte instead. I did try the olive oil cake as well. This tasted like the cakes that I bake myself because I do use olive oil lol. Nothing impressive, and I'm not too sure how I felt about the wintergreen fennel. Unique but not quite my cup of tea for a dessert.

Overall this place isn't worth spending like $95 bucks for 2 (including tax and tips plus one drink, excludes parking). Plus we weren't even seated in the main area which really ruined our experience. We were seated in an area to the right, which felt like a storage room...the waiters were also preparing for an event in the room across. They were moving chairs from our room throughout our meal. We found that a bit rude and disrupting. I would rate it anywhere between 3-4 stars. Really the salmon made the meal. Would I go back? I don't really know about that. Maybe for the salmon...?"}
{"text":"Went during normal times and during Winterlicious times on several occasions but I'm here to review the most recent experience, which was Winterlicious 2016.  

Appetizer: 
We decided to diverge and have both potage a la courge (butternut squash soup) and salade composee (salad).  Both were really good but I think the butternut squash won out.  It was flavourful and had the right amount of sweet and salty.  The wild cod brandade in the soup really was a nice complement to the soup. 

Mains: 
The boeuf bourguignon was absolutely delicious and that cheek was a melt in your mouth sort of deliciousness.  I was so impressed with the dish I almost didn't share it with my bf.  Sadly, the boyfriend chose chicken and it was just so underwhelming.  It was a plain piece of overcooked meat - I almost felt bad for him for making that poor life choice.  

Dessert: 
Both the meringue and almond cake were delicious.  However, the almond cake again absolutely won out.  It was fragrant, moist, and absolutely orgasmically delicious.  Dessert was definitely the best part of the whole meal. 

Overall, I'd say that the food was good - a little bit cookie cutter and not so unique - however, I give credit to the fact that this menu was designed for Winterlicious.  The times I've gone here on non-licious occasions have been very pleasant with friendly service, etc.  

I must, however, say that I didn't give this place 5 stars because of a pretty rude comment from our server.  Don't get me wrong - she was absolutely pleasant from beginning to end.  However, the boyfriend asked her if she'd recommend coming back on a non-licious occasion and she absolutely agreed.  However, what I found a bit rude was that she said that during regular occasions, it's a better, more real experience because Winterlicious is designed for people who can't otherwise afford it regularly.  Partially true - but lady, filter!!  I personally found it a bit rude - she probably saw my judgemental face because she stopped it at there. In this latter part, I'm really not looking to get anyone in trouble but I just really hope that proper staff training will be instigated on client interactions."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

Went here for the most recent summerlicious. I've been to authentic French restaurants in Quebec before, so I do have high hopes for this place, although I gave it some wiggle room since I'm not in Quebec after all.

The menu is the usual and there's not a lot to choose. I assume the place changes their menu every so often, judging by some of the reviews I've read. Despite the fact the server initially only gave us the summerlicious menu, the full menu was indeed available.

I had the soupe, ravioles, and chocolat. The soup was a gazpacho soup, so it was intended to the cold. The ravioles was a lemon ricotta ravioli. The chocolat was a dark chocolate cake with mint white chocolate ice cream.

Everything was made to my satisfaction, with my only complaint being the fact the ravioli was a bit overcooked. Considering the fact it was summerlicious I kinda let that go, since I do understand the fact kitchens have only so much staff to handle the increased demand. The chocolate cake was particularly excellent, and I highly recommend ordering that as a dessert.

Service was excellent and servers were great. It's not the best French restaurant I've ever had, but for Toronto standards this place was definitely very good."}
{"text":"I went here during Summerlicious and i absolutely loved it. The food was great and the atmosphere was even better. The restaurant and food could be considered \"Instagram - worthy\""}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Auberge; a friend and I attended for midweek lunch during Winterlicious. Overall, this was a good experience and given that we were there for the food festival, the value was terrific for the quality of food and service.  Everything we ordered was delicious, the portion sizes decent, and the staff very friendly and attentive.  We were disappointed that we were going to have to wait 30 minutes for our table, when we'd made a reservation and were on time; we agreed to sit elsewhere, though it would have been nicer to sit in the original spot.  We were also disappointed in the level of noise and upon mentioning it to our server, were advised that it was unusual for it to be that noisy, but due to the influx of patrons during Winterlicious, they were busier than usual, with several large groups contributing to the din.  I didn't look at the regular menu, so I don't know what the regular prices are, but I would definitely attend at full price."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!

I wanted to write a review for this restaurant after a regular dining experience and an experience as a wedding guest.

The regular dining experience was great. The atmosphere was cozy and romantic, and it gave a really \"French\" feel to it.

Re: food - Small portions, but because we ordered the $100 5-course tasting menu, it was just enough to make us feel full. Some of the dishes were more memorable than others, such as the quail and lobster dish, but the others were good too. The total price of the meal, including three glasses of wine, taxes, and gratuity, came to $315.  I don't think that it was actually worth the price, to be honest, but it was an interesting experiencing and the staff was friendly and professional.

The food at the wedding was great as well, definitely better than most banquet hall menus. However, I would say that the quality of the regular dining experience was better. The service at the wedding was impeccable and just perfect. All of the staff members were friendly, helpful, and very down-to-earth. They really do allow you to customize the decor to your liking, but my friend didn't add too much to what already existed because it looked great on its own.

Overall, 4.5 stars for Auberge. I think that this is a place to experience once in your life if you're willing to splurge; however, if not, I'd suggest going with the Summerlicious/Winterlicious menus to try it out."}
{"text":"My summerlicious experience here was as perfect as my server's hair

Ordered the terrine to start.  I thought there was a great blend of sweetness and acidity  between the peach and pickled mushroom.  The chicken terrine itself was also well-made, and the app def set my expectation high for the entree.

That expectation was definitely met by the sea bream which had skin so crispy you could hear it crunching in your mouth.  The fish was seasoned deliciously and those roasted grapes complemented the sea bream really, really well.  I had a little bit of the steak as well, the medium rare was done right but the rub on the steak was lacking a litlte bit - and I hated the olive tapenade because I hate olives, so thank goodness I didn't go for that.

The dessert was nothing special, the mille feuille was deconstructed and not what I expected - but it was a decent end to my meal because at least the plating was beautiful.  The honeydew soup was surprisingly refreshing and almost made me wish I'd ordered that instead.  

If this is what Auberge offered for their icious menus, I definitely would come back for their regular items on a special occasion.  I'm a fan"}
{"text":"This place has really good food, though its not cheap. I went for winterlicous and thoroughly enjoyed everything I had. Great service too.

The appetizer might have been the standout. It was a cod cream with a dense foam sort of consistency served with paper-thin candied eureka lemon slices, capers, onions and crispy french bread slices. Out of this world. The flavours married each other and had babies. that good.

The main course I had was a duck quiche. And let me tell you, they were not stingy on the duck. It was packed in there quite densely. Also fantastic.

I had a creme brule for dessert. It was good, but not on par with the rest of the meal.

Check it out."}
{"text":"I recently attended a business dinner here and from the moment we entered until we left, the experience was excellent.

The staff are very polite, accommodating and knowledgeable about all aspects of the restaurant and the menu. They provided us with detailed explanations of the meal, including food and drink recommendations.

As this was a business dinner, we were seated in the 'Oscar' room which was quite large and comfortably accommodated our group. There were adequate audio/visual supplies for presentations and support staff on hand.

Prior to dinner, we were served drinks as well as passed appetizers including canapes and kebabs. For my appetizer the server suggested I choose the heirloom salad which was a good sized portion with fresh tomatoes, greens and cheese, and an interesting sweet crumble made of brown sugar.

As the entree, I chose the salmon which was presented quite nicely atop root vegetables, and well-seasoned.

The dessert was a citrus cheesecake which was light and refreshing, and complimented the rest of the meal nicely.

The servers were very attentive in replenishing our drinks, removing dinnerware and ensured that the dishes were brought out in a coordinated and well-timed manner.

Overall, the ambiance is lovely, the decor is 'charming' and elegant, and the customer service and quality of food lives up to its reputation.

Merci beaucoup!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Came here for Winterlicious. From the second we walked in we were treated like royalty.   I would come back solely for the service. 

After we sat down we were served some bread with a artichoke spread. The artichoke spread was really nice. I will totally have to steal that recipe. We decided to go with the wine pairing which included a 3oz, 3oz and 1oz with each of the courses respectively. 

I had the smoked salmon rillette which came with cornichon, capers, dill crème fraîche, and O&B Artisan pretzel bread. These flavors go really well with one another and it had just the right amount of every component. It was a great way to start my meal. It was paired with a sauvignon blanc from France. 

For the second course I had the duck confit with toasted barley, dried cherries, root vegetables, and spiced duck jus. The duck was cooked to perfection and forked apart. The skin was crispy. I literally scrapped the plate. This came with a pinot noir from Niagara (organized crime was the name of the winery).

For dessert I had the cardamom creme brulee. I have to mention that the cardamom flavor was completely absent from this dish. Nevertheless it was phenomenal. It was paired with a muscat from Australia."}
{"text":"Auberge Du Pommier is a little hidden away from the noise of the area and when you walk inside you feel you are somewhere else, but not in the city. It's décor is beautiful and relaxing, the outdoor patio even better. The food is incredible, everything I have tried has been excellent. I have been here with the girls for a good time, and also for a more romantic evening with the hub, it never disappoints. The service is excellent, although our waitress once mistook the candleholder for a glass, and drowned out our candle lol. I will continue to come back as I enjoy it so much."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful. The service was wonderful and food was incredible.

Upon arriving the hostess kindly checked our coats before having one of the waiters lead us to our table. The waitress who was taking care of us was cheerful, welcoming and friendly. 

I went for winterlicious, I'll definitely be going back to try their tasting menu after this.

For the appetizer I ordered the duck croquettes. The filling was all meat, which was a pleasant surprise. It was flavourful with a soft, rich, juicy filling and crispy shell. The parsnip remoulade offered a crisp bite and added a wonderful creaminess to the dish. The torched orange and pickled pear lent the dish a bright taste that was refreshing after the richness of the duck and creaminess of the remoulade. The plating was beautiful, I especially lived the (delicious) dabs of bright orange sauce.

My mother had the rabbit and pork hock terrine. It was rich and the ginger bread was very crisp. It was beautifully plated and she enjoyed quite a bit.

For the main course I ordered the Cornish hen. It was incredible! First of all the truffled cassoulet was amazing, the deep earthy flavour of the truffle was lovely and so comforting. The Cornish hen was moist with a delightfully crisp skin that was well seasoned. The mushrooms and the reisling reduction lent the dish a bright counter point, that kept the flavour of the cassoulet interesting. The only thing that I wasn't thrilled about was that the beans were at different levels of firmness and a few were a tad crunchy, not enough to be unpleasant but with how wonderful everything else was, it was noticeable. Other than that though it was fantastic and I'd love to have it again.

The beef tenderloin was beautifully plated. The pomme puree was very tasty. I can't say too much about this one because they were preparing the meat as medium rare but my mother gets squeamish over red meat so she insisted on having it well done. I'm sure the beef would have been amazing if not for that request.

The dessert was tasty as well. We had the lemon tartelette and the chocolat. The lemon chamomile curd was fantastic, such a bright, sunny flavour and the bergamot meringue was a wonderful counterpoint to that. The tart shell was a bit too hard to cut through with a fork though. 

The chocolate ganache was incredible rich! I absolute loved it. The mouth feel was just dreamy and the muscovado crisp and caramelized bananas were great too. I just wish they had toasted the cashews in the cashew crumble or something though, the raw cashew flavour jumped out in a way I didn't quite enjoy.

We finished dinner off with a pot of mint tea and left full and happy after thoroughly enjoying dinner."}
{"text":"Auberge du Pommier is located in the cottage-like building, quaint on the outside but exquisite as you enter. It's a fine dining French restaurant with a seasonal menu that boasts modern cuisine and a 500 label wine selection. It's managed by Oliver & Bonacini what means one can expect the highest quality of food, drinks & service - and will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My most recent visit was during Winterlicious, for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It took longer than it should have for the hostesses to greet us and even longer for them to offer to take our coats. Even though I had reservations for 12:30pm and showed up on time, my table of two did not get seated until around 1:20pm. No acknowledgement at all about the delay- a bad sign of the service to come. 

It took about 15 minutes for our sever to come by and we ordered our meals right away. The time it took for the food to come out was absurd. We didn't finish dessert until about 3pm and it took an additional 10 minutes to get the bill. We ended up running so late because we spent way too much time here.

The bread and butter for the table was stingy and average. The salad was surprisingly large and well-balanced. The chicken terrine w/ leek, turnip, sweet potato was so dry. The flavors were not so much delicate as they were bland. This was probably the worst item we tried. The braised beef was extremely stringy- the best part of this dish was the pearl barely. The citrus-crusted salmon w/ rapini, mustard, polenta, caper lemon cream was such a TINY portion, it could have passed as an appetizer. The salmon was tender but a little too close to raw on the inside and the rapini was not prepared properly turning out extremely bitter. The salted caramel chocolate tarte was super rich and super sweet. Sadly, the tart shell was dry and chalky which took away from this dessert. The blood orange parfait w/ buttermilk gelee, mandarin ice cream was decent, with the mandarin ice cream being bright and refreshing.

Even with the Winterlicious factor in mind, the quality of the food and service was extremely disappointing. I'm hoping this was just a bad day and not the restaurant going downhill overall."}
{"text":"Auberge du Pommier is probably one of the best fine dining restaurants in uptown Toronto.  Located in North York, this French diner is decorated beautifully with stone interior and a petite courtyard covered in trellises.   

Due to monetary restrictions, I've only visited for Summerlicious and Winterlicious. During these periods, the chefs may surprise you with additional treats in between your dishes (i.e. watercress tarts, Scottish shortbread with honey). The service is always outstanding and the food is sure to impress.

Despite the limited options as a vegetarian visiting a French restaurant, I've never been disappointed with what I've been served.  During Summerlicious 2009, I had - as a special order - a delectable medley of root vegetables and sweet corn accompanied with fresh blue cheese.  As well, there were sauteed mushrooms of several varieties - all cooked to perfection - including a generous portions of morales and chanterelles.  For dessert, there was a peach tart - with a perfect, flaky crust - paired with a scoop of almond ice cream.  

The service is also outstanding and I always make it a point to tip a little extra. Highly recommended for the true foodies.

PARKING: Your ticket can be validated if you park in the garage downstairs."}
{"text":"Honestly best French restaurant in Toronto. The food is spectacular, lovely staff, and the outdoor patio is beautiful."}
{"text":"My parents wanted to take me out for a nice dinner for my quarter century - so picked this from the shortlist of restaurants that offered dinner prix fixe menus. The place is tucked away quietly on Yonge between York Mills and the 401 - a wooden cottage with old-fashioned (in the good way) decor and surrounded by gardens. I can see why people would choose this venue for a beautiful summer wedding. The wait staff was knowledgeable of the menu, and the service was impeccable, which I guess would be expected for this type of fine dining, and the prices charged.

I wish I was equally impressed with the food as I was with the ambiance and service. Unfortunately, we found the food very underwhelming. The one more memorable item was the \"du jardin\" course - which on that day was a refreshing tomato salad. I thought the escargot was also pretty interesting - though my parents were not fans. For the mains, my mom and I both had fish and my dad the boeuf - we all agreed we had better elsewhere.

Overall, I had a good experience here for the occasion, the service and the environment. I would recommend coming here for summerlicious or winterlicious - you get the experience for a less steep price, which is more reasonable for the quality of the food served."}
{"text":"We came here for Winterlicious, for the first time, and we loved it. As soon as we came in, we were greeted by the very friendly staff and they even took our coats! The ambiance is perfect and the music was just the right volume. We loved being able to actually talk to each other without having to yell over the music and noise. The waiter was also great - he definitely deserved the tip! 

We both had the salad and the mushroom ravioli. The salad was good, but it had a bit too much dressing, which sort of ruined the taste for us. The ravioli was amazing though. Everything was cooked to perfection and the creamy sauce was delicious. For dessert, I can't remember the names, but I had an almond apple cake and my boyfriend had a sort of mousse meringue type thing with pomegranate sauce. We weren't too excited about that, but once we tasted it, we were so glad the waiter told us to order it! 

Overall, amazing experience and we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Do you need a special restaurant to celebrate a special occasion? Well, you are on the right track if you are considering this place.

There's a lot to like about this restaurant. It got great parking, beautiful ambience and delicious food. More importantly, the price is reasonable for the quality you are getting. There are many expensive places that do not live up to their price, but not this place. You will get your bucks' worth!

I absolutely love their lobster bisque. I personally wouldn't mind having a giant bowl with some bread on the side as my main. The foie grais is a must have as well! However, a friend of mine had the beef tartare and I think he saw the gates of heaven after one bite.

Their duck and their lamb entres are both amazing. I know my smile got bigger and bigger after each bite...so did my stomach. Their dessert is good and I don't think you can go wrong with any choices to be honest. I would say just go with what you feel like and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Reminded me of our most disappointing restaurant week dining experience at One if By Land, Two if by Sea - gorgeous venue but \"I've experienced better\" in all other categories. 

$48 for summerlicious dinner - even for this caliber level of restaurant, I thought it was way overpriced for the quality we received. 

Chicken terrain - tasted like canned chicken as in the ones you throw in to make lame chicken salad sandwich. 

Pork croquettes - unbelievably dry and tasteless. I had to douse mine in the balsamic vinegar I initially requested for bread to moisten them to edible condition. 

Sea bream - the skin was soggy, the fish was lukewarm. The mushy potato salad and minimal salsa pairing were way under seasoned. One of the worst dishes I'd had in my recent memories. 

Beef loin - The driest piece of medium rare steak I've ever taste. Not quite sure how they managed to suck out every drop of moisture out of that piece of meat. My jaw hurt from chewing one sample piece my husband offered. And again, the chef either forgot or didn't have time to salt any of the foods this evening. 

Panna cotta and chocolate mousse - both were mediocre at best - Boring at its finest. 

Service - bad foods paired with terrible service - our server was outwardly uncomfortable and awkward. 2 hrs in the restaurant? 1 hr and 55 mins with empty water glasses. I had to repeatedly ask for condiments and water refills - both which were repeatedly forgotten! His excuse to us later was \"we have over 300 reservations this evening, we are low on items\". So I guess water too? 

Overall - summerlicious or not - definitely didn't convince us to return ever - not worth the time and a waste of money and calories. Skip skip skip."}
{"text":"Based on summerlicious 2017, I found the place okay... and in comparison to other restaurants participated in the event, this restaurant menu was just so regular and so was the taste.  There was nothing distinctive about the food, although I was pretty impressed by their service. The Victorian style was impressive and beautiful. All the servers were very professional, and their attention of each customer was pretty good. 

They start with butter and bread and they keep refilling it generously. bread was fresh and warm.

I ordered - Strawberry Gaspacho for starters- it was served at room temperature, I would prefer it cold, for mains I ordered Tagliatelle with sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, olives and peas, it was much below my expectation, a basic pasta white with peas- that's all. I really did not like it at all. But the desserts Flourless chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream & Cream brûlée really saved the day. The Cream brûlée was fantastic. 

My husband ordered Foie Gras pate & Salmon with sea asparagus and polenta- He can't forget that salmon, he really loved it. 

Maybe I should try out their regular dinner sometime, which might do the justice to this upscale price place."}
{"text":"wish i could fancy a meal here more often. great stuff"}
{"text":"NOTE: This review is for a Summerlicious experience, so it may not be representative of the typical diner's experience here

The main disappointment of my meal was the service (though the food was utterly and completely average, but I'll get to that in a second). I have rarely experienced such slow service, and it was particularly concerning at a nice restaurant with a simple pre-set menu for Summerlicious.
The service started off excellent - waitress saw us to our seats, pulled our chairs out for us, and laid napkins on our laps. She kept our water glasses full throughout the evening and gave us a quick run-down of the menu and the drink pairings for Summerlicious. Off to a good start! After we ordered our appetizers, they came in a reasonable amount of time - nothing to remark upon. But this is when it started to go downhill. During the appetizers, a waiter brought a drink to our table. He stood tableside for a moment, not sure where to put it and the waitress came over and gestured him towards one of my friends. After he put it down in front of her, I asked her if she had ordered it and she said no. That's when the waitress realized she had the cocktail delivered to the wrong table (even though she had gestured the waiter to my friend specifically). 
Our mains took 30 mins after the appetizer plates were cleared to come. The dessert took over 20 minutes to arrive, even though none of the dessert options were freshly prepared. Throughout all this the waitress never once apologized about the wait or commented on it at all. I don't think I've ever waited so long for food, and the main was not hot when it arrived.
The cherry on the cake was that when our waitress brought over fresh cutlery for dessert she only brought us spoons and forks even though half of us had the cheese plate for dessert. We ended up using our spoons to spread the goat cheese on the crostini, and the waitress even popped by just after we started eating and said 'bon appetit' without doing anything about the fact that we were clearly awkardly eating cheese with a spoon!
It was honestly so disappointing from a place of this calibre.
We all agreed that the food was 'fine.' Nothing terrible but also absolutely nothing to rave about. They got the portion sizes right, it was just filling enough, but that's where it ended. I think I would have enjoyed myself more almost anywhere else with a Summerlicious menu."}
{"text":"I Always enjoyed this restaurant but now it's even gotten better. I've eaten here half a dozen times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here for Summerlicious dinner.  We had a reservation at 8:15pm but it was past 9pm before we got to order. I was not too happy about the long wait time. However, I liked the ambient environment and decors. 

Appetizer: chicken terrine. It was heavy and pasty. My boyfriend said it reminds him of SPAM. Was not a huge fan. 

Entree: Sea bream. The fish was scrumptious and flavourful. It came with a helping of chick peas. I really liked it! 

Dessert: creme patisserie. It was average at most. I liked my boyfriends dessert (smoked cheese) more. 

Overall, I thought it was decent but not the best summerlicious dining experience. I got a few snazzy pictures in front of the restaurant though!"}
{"text":"This place has been excellent every time I've come. Originally tried it as part of Winterlicious menu and was hooked. I went back again for an anniversary and was dazzled even more.
Hands down one of the best French restaurants in town. Food is consistent and complex but harmonious and the presentation is very carefully made. The staff are absolutely pleasant and knowledgeable. Sure, you can have my money."}
{"text":"Auberge du Pommier is a first-class dining establishment.  The food was beautiful and delicious; the service was professional and personable at the same time.  This place has the old-school charm of fine dining while avoiding the dated decor and menu.  The fact that there were no hipsters there also makes the dining experience so much better.

I originally came here for Summerlicious but opted to or off the regular menu instead.  For appetizers, we had the foie gras mouse and the steak tartare.  The foie gras was incredibly smooth and well balanced while the steak tartare was good but I personally would liked a bit more acidity.  I had the squab en croute as my main; it was delicious.  It was like a ginormous and luxurious spring roll, the squab was PERFECTLY cooked and not dry at all.  I tried a bite of my friend's tuna and it like a nice kick.  Towards the end of the meal, we tried two of their grappas which I wasn't even aware of before.  They were extremely pungent and very rough going down but I'm still glad I tried them.  Thank God we got the chocolat Napoleon to wash them down.  

I thoroughly enjoyed the entire meal and there is nothing I can complain about.  I feel like this place is for people who really appreciate the genuine dining experience.  No hype, just perfection."}
{"text":"Over the years, things have just gone a bit downhill at Auberge but they still continue to be among the top 20 in Toronto. 

In my younger years, it was the restaurant you'd aspire to go to, and save up for. 
In my latter years, it's been the restaurant you knew you'd get consistency at, and the perfect spot to celebrate or take special out of town guests to. 

For me, the service is what's really changed. It's gotten younger, which is no real issue, except it's come with a little attitude, and frankly, when i'm trying to enjoy dinner, I can really do without it. The service reminds me a little bit of the service at Byblos, where the waiters treat you like they're doing you a favour by serving you."}
{"text":"I came here for winterlicious and was very impressed considering it wasn't too expensive. Prix Fixe meals are usually a hit or miss because restaurants still need to profit despite the low price for the 3 course meal. However, Auberge didn't disappoint me. Each meal was made to perfection. Although the portions were dainty, the flavours, presentation, cooking skill, everything was there. It is definitely the second best O+B restaurant right after Canoe."}
{"text":"It's really a good place!! Went there for summerlicious lunch! You will love there service! Recommend the watermelon soup and also the olive oil cake, crispy fish brandade!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Kick butt view. Awesome service and the food is great. Just too bad I can't afford to go every week."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an upscale French restaurant.  The food is delicious and the service is excellent.  They are very very quick with their food and service so if you eat quickly you can pretty much eat and leave within 1 hour.  We came here for winterlicious and each dish was a work of art.  Note: there is only free parking after 5.  They will not validate your parking before that and it would costs you additional $5 for parking."}
{"text":"This was one of the first reservations we made for Summerlicious this year because we had this restaurant as one of our picks for our upcoming reception next year. I had the highest expectations and overall, my expectations were met. 

Parking is easily accessible, I believe $10 for underground before 5pm (complimentary after 5pm) but we managed to find $4 flat rate parking on Sat afternoon literally 2 min walk from the restaurant at the York Mills TTC station. When you first walk in, the restaurant looks clean and upscale. You see a wall of red and white wine selections. I'm not much of a wine person, so I wouldn't know whether they had good wines here. 

Most of the patrons here seem to be dining for the Summerlicious deal like us. Mostly couples and some large groups. We were seated 5 min after our reservations on what seemed like a busy Saturday lunch. We were seated in the back area with a comfy cushion for me and a comfortable chair for my fiance. This area seemed to be more of the intimate and romantic area for couples since the lighting seemed to be a bit darker. I honestly liked the decor with the brick walls and biege/yellow colour scheme. 

Our waiter was attentive and polite. As a table service, they brought us freshly baked (so it seemed) dinner rolls (French bread?) with a delicious dip. I had to ask the waiter what was in the dip and he replied, \"Roasted artichoke, olive oil and salt and pepper. That's it!\" That definitely made me think I gotta make this at home!

We both started with the Watermelon Gazpacho. In my opinion, the portion was a big larger than I would've liked for a gazpacho, but the watermelon soup was chilled perfectly, there were large chunks of watermelon and cucumber which added texture, little bits of Feta cheese which added a nice rich salty taste, foccaccia crouton to add crunchy and salt texture, and minced mint leaves. I would've liked the mint leaves left out but it added a nice freshness to the soup. Overall, nice flavour. I couldn't finish it due to its large portion. It seems like one of those chilled soups you want to have a few \"bites\" and then move on.

For our mains, we chose the Chicken Corden Bleu and the Crispy Fish Brandade. My first bite of the Chicken Corden Bleu was nice. The chicken was cooked well, the overlying crust wasn't overly oily and added a nice crunch. My idea of Corden Bleu was with a slice of meat (like proscuitto) and cheese. All I got was cheese. Also, the chicken wasn't seasoned at all. I realize there was some mustard vinaigrette and smoked bacon jus but that was underneath the bed of a bean salad (which was seasoned and cooked well and was tasty) which totally got lost with the protein. The sweet onion soubise was delicious. A touch of sea salt or lemon would've brought it over the top but I'm not complaining. My fiance's Crispy Fish Brandade was much better. I called it the snobby fish cake. The breaded outer part was delicious as well was the inside which seemed to be combination of fish and mashed potato. The portion for this seemed small. The side salad with whatever salad dressing was a nice compliment. 

Finally, the dessert came. For whatever reason, until the dessert portion of the meal, I commented that the service was quick but the dessert took a very long time. We ordered the Olive Oil Cake and the Ice Cream Sandwich. The Olive Oil cake was interesting. Not overly sweet, with a lemon curd that wasn't too sour or sweet. The cake was moist to akin of a sponge cake. The macerated blueberries were interesting as were the candied lemon zest. Eaten altogether, the moist cake with the lemon curd and blueberries was nice. The one thing to point out was there was some saltiness somewhere in this dessert. That little punch of saltiness added an unforgettable part to this dessert. I'd eat this one again. I had the Ice Cream Sandwich, which was nothing special but done well. Three small ice cream (tasted like cookies & creme) sandwiches with okay chocolate chip cookies and candied hazelnuts, which was the highlight of this dessert for me. I've always loved hazelnuts and carmelized sugar on top made it even better. 

Overall, a nice Summerlicious experience. The service was good. I've had effy Summerlicious experiences but this has to be one that shouldn't be missed if you live uptown. I'd come back again! Perhaps we will book it for our reception!"}
{"text":"Being the highest o&b restaurant, i was hoping for the best. But i think auberge lacks that bold flavor that would just make me want for more. Had the tasting menu last night, started off the smoke sturgeon, really great smoked flavor. The foie terrine. Was lovely but had to wait for the bread person to come, its too rich on its own. Delicious though. The scallop with bouillabaisse was next believe it or not the toast was the best part of the dish. Crisp brioche with 3 different elements to try with. Scallop was cooked beautifully med rare. The tomato jelly was the least favorite, just didnt like it. 
Had the steak, nothing wrong here. But it was just meh. The cod that my partner ordered was very moist but the accompaniment that it had wasnt too appetizing. The dessert was the best part! The chocolate and strawberry dessert was both presented beautiful and delicious."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav restaurant in T.O.  For over 10+ years I have been a fan of theirs.  Auberge's food quality, presentation, ambiance and SERVICE has been the same time over time!  Their service to us whether it was our first birthday dinner as teenagers or to today that we have become adults and married, Auberge's customer service has NEVER altered!  This is why we have come back time and time again for the last decade!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to go to Auberge du Pommier for many years.  It's my birthday and Winterlicious 2018 is on so it was a great opportunity.  We were beyond thrilled.  The service was friendly and efficient and the meal was fabulous!  We both made the same selections:  Ginger Carrot soup, Beef tenderloin and Chocolate Caramel Tarte...so delicious! I'd love to return! (extra bonus was parking validated after 5:30 pm)"}
{"text":"FABULOUS. :)
a little house tucked in from the hustle of the yonge and york mills interesection. the moment you reach the gorgeous white double french doors, you feel special walking into a countryside home with BEAUTIFUL Ambiance.  It's as romantic as it gets!
The newly renovated decor truly lives up to the \"auberge\" name (french for 'inn').

Glorious service that spoils you to no end beginning with their sweet hosts and knowledgeable servers.  My friend was a vegetarian and they catered to her needs with zest.  
The food was intricate, beautiful, and delicately balanced, and every bite was a big bang and wow in your mouth.  Each dish was full of bold and big flavoured organic ingredients. 

at one point our server recommended a spruce birch non alcoholic beer, and we tried it and i am still dreaming about it -- it was amazing.

YUM YUM YUM
from the articoke spread for your freshly baked ethereal bread that comes out fluffy and crunchy at the perfect temperature with olives
to the passion fruit granita,
amuse bouche soup 
octopus terrine
organic greens, 
and the amazingly sauted kimpachi --
every bite was memorable. and that is definitely a mouthful to say. ;)
esp in toronto.
highly recommended for a nice night out.
~$70-100/ person"}
{"text":"This is a review for their summerlicious 2015 menu for my meal.
Start: The blueberry mint fiz drink was not fizzy and not refreshing as we had expected. The warm bread was nice. The salad appetizer was bland - mixed greens with very little dressing. 
The entree - artichoke and ricotta ravioli was salty and nothing special - about 4 or 5 medium squares, with a few peas, carrot slices and pickled artichoke which tasted weird; the only highlight on the plate were the mushrooms. 
As a dessert lover, this was the most disappointing - the melon was a combination of honeydew melon water with some crushed ice, watermelon and cantaloupe. It was a big disappointment. The cheese plate was ok and the pastry one was ridiculously small and it looked like the dish had been sitting out for a while. The brushed chocolate was dry. 
The service was good. However, it took long to get our entree.
I had heard good things about this restaurant; however, I don't think their food (summerlicious) reflects what I had heard/expected from an Oliver Bonacini restaurant. Also, I don't know why the dinner menu is $45 when they offer the exact same thing as the lunch menu for $28?"}
{"text":"Decided to try some wine from Austria... It was my first Austrian wine. So delicious! Perfectly excellent. Enjoyed every sip and wished there was more when I ran out.

Truffle soup is AMAZING. If you must have one thing, it is this. Oh, and wine.

Lobster was delicious and cooked perfectly. It came several ways: lobster tail, lobster \"mitts\" cakes, in rice.

Steak was good too. Not huge on foie gras because you can never be sure if the ducks are force-fed and lived miserable, tortured lives, but it came with my friend's dish. It was pretty good and better than other foie gras I've tasted in the past. All meats and the lobster were cooked perfectly. Very moist. I was surprised at how they made something like duck heart non-repulsive and actually appetizing. Very impressive.

Service was amazing and very attentive. I felt almost embarrassed for the amount of people weighing on us at a time (3 at one point). They really make you feel like a valued customer... too much even! (but I definitely wasn't complaining) So much going on. Water never emptied and they almost always remembered that I didn't want ice. They are on the ball with service. That part is a definite 10.

Atmosphere was gorgeous. I was commenting on it the whole time. Nice, old fashioned. Rich people kinda place. The place looked, felt and smelled like freshly printed on plasticized notes crisp $100 bills. Expensive but if you like the finer things in life and don't mind paying a generous premium, go here. 

If you want to impress a date by showing them you have wads of cash that you can blow on a lavish dinner and want them a part of your lavish lifestyle, this is a strong contender in the restaurant lineup for that! Even if you're not trying to woo your date with your wallet, this is a great, romantic atmosphere. So much attention to detail. Not a cheap night out. Not the best choice if you're looking for good value, but if you forget about the money, you will have a great time. Probably the best work of the O&B group.

If you drive, get your parking validated by the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for my friends wedding last Sunday and it's a beautiful venue! My favourite was the vanilla panna cotta with strawberry consommé and lychee sorbet. Such a nice light floral dessert!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience here for my anniversary. My date had arranged for flowers to be placed at the table prior to us arriving and they were beautiful. They also printed personal menus for us and presented them to us at the end with a red ribbon. Service was amazing, with quite attentive staff and knowledgeable servers who were each well versed with the menu items and ingredients. 
We both had the chefs tasting menu (5course meal) with wine pairing. Each plate was beautifully presented and tasted delicious beginning with an amuse bouche. My favourite was the BC scallop in seafood bouille and the 45day aged steak was cooked to perfection with equally delicious trimmings. All in all it was an amazing night and completed my list of OB experiences on a high note. We will most likely be back on our next special occasion~  Thank you again to the lovely chefs and staff at this restaurant for making our night so delightful!"}
{"text":"Its that time of the year, summerlicious! Took my mama here for a lunch date cuz french apparently is her fav cuisine lol

Ive heard so much about this place and all the hype going around the internet so I thought i had to give it a try. We ordered different things just so we could try more variety on the summerlicious menu. 

Appetizer: 
The rolls were warm. But nothing extravagant. I was pretty shock they served margarine, not even butter.  
Soup - i really did not like it. Didnt even finish half of it. Almost felt like i was drinking baby puke (not kidding)
Terrine - it was ok. Didnt taste any of the foie gras

Entree:
Salmon - it was a bit over cooked. But overall good flavours except the polenta. Nice plating
Steak - nice plating, tender and juicy. Gravy and veggies were good

Dessert:
Creme bulee - thought i couldnt go wrong with this but the cake crumbs on the side was meh. Egg flav was strong. 
Chocolate cake - flourless cake, stiff, nutty. But not too sweet. It was okay

Honestly, i didnt know if its because i had higher expectation on this place, the food was pretty disappointing. The service was good tho, made reservations, got served right away as i walked in. There were many people at the waiting area. There was only one server for the entire room with mayb like 8 tables, but she managed ok. Not sure if i would give it another try... even if its summerlicious menu, it shouldnt be that far off from quality."}
{"text":"Impeccable French techniques and well presented dishes. Can't go wrong with auberge for a delicious meal, and actually one of the few restaurants that the season-licious menus are not so watered down to make you feel like having a subpar experience."}
{"text":"Auberge du Pommier literally translates as the Apple Tree Inn and quite simply is an idyllic escape squirrelled away north of the city.  No, there were no dwarves, or bears or antagonistic wolves at this cottage, but it's pastoral beauty certainly conjures up fairy tale like imagery and enchantment. Walking in I can't help but feel like a high maintenance Goldilocks as my eyes delight from every decorative detail from the stone grotto like archways to the elegantly comfy chairs swathed in Toile de Jouy.

 Auberge is certainly a dining magnet for the well heeled and well coiffed ladies as we spot tables-upon-tables of Stepford-like wives with their well cultivated wardrobes, careful mannerisms and their bevy of envy inducing Valentino and Ysl status bags!  Hmmm Real Housewives of North Toronto much?

I came for my birthday lunch hosted by the gracious in-laws and I was loving every minute of soaking up the pseudo-Provincial ambiance.  Papa-in-law who is of the no-nonsense \"meat 'n' potatoes\" ilk seemed a little intimidated by the prescription estrogen overload here, but once his order of Cumbrae Farms Steak came he took to Augerge like shag carpet does to a pimp's bachelor pad. 

Did I mention that the food at Auberge is simply ambrosial?   *Le sigh* in fact it's so good it's difficult to talk about without drowning in your own salivary fluids!  Each dish was served like a work of edible art, every ingredient carefully layered to paint the picture for a stunningly savory masterpiece.  As lunch began to resemble oeuvres at auction, to hubby it was all the same as his beautifully plated Steak Tartare was devoured with neanderthal-esque aplomb!   Mum-in-law had the Quenelles and was impressed at how delicately tasty the seafood dumplings are. I chose the brunch prix fixe lunch of market salad and the oeufs fines herbes, which was simply brilliant. Our meal was complimented with mignardises which in this case was a chorus of delightful pastel coloured macarons, the perfect finish to a fantastic brunch.

Yes it is indeed quite spendy at Auberge but it's my birthday dammit!  Plus the In-laws splurged so I can't be ungrateful ;)  I highly recommend a visit as you'll be spoiled with rustic charm, class and refinement while dining in grand gourmand style at Auberge de Pommier."}
{"text":"Ah Auberge du Pommier...one of the nicest restaurants in Toronto. Located a bit out of downtown is Auberge...it's a really ambient dining space that boasts modern French fare, perfect for any special occasion. 

I went again during the 'licious' time, and had a wonderful lunch. The staff are always very friendly and do their best to accommodate a reservation for you despite being extremely busy this time of year (though not as busy as Canoe). Managed to get a lunchtime reservation and jumped at the chance. 

The menu, like all Winterlicious menus, has multiple options for you to choose from for your appetizer, main, and dessert. I opted for the carrot soup, salmon, and parfait. 

The carrot soup was great, though plating could be slightly improved - though it's soup so it's a tad difficult. Taste was amazing and had bits of carrot cake crumble at the bottom making the soup very hearty. 

The salmon was delicious! Plated perfectly, the salmon was fresh and tasty complete with a citrus crust and creamy polenta. They also did an amazing job cooking the rapini which is usually very bitter. 

The parfait was more like a cheesecake but still just as delicious. The blood orange flavours were a great way to cleanse your palette of the main, and leave the restaurant on a sweet note. 

Service as always was great - attentive and made sure to refill water (and bread) efficiently. 

Overall a great experience! If you have the chance to visit, do it!"}
{"text":"The food quality wasn't a \"wow\" but overall the whole experience was a pretty good and excellent for summerlicious.

My experience through my many summerlicious since they announced offering these at restaurants have gone done hill. I've found many restaurants just offering bad service and mediocre food.

I think the whole idea should be for restaurants to show case what they offer on a daily basis. I definitely think Auberge du Pommier won a new customer from this experience. I will be going back to try the normal menu.

- Service was friendly and amazing
- You \"need\" to pay for parking there if you go before 5 but I heard from the servers there they park there all the time without paying :)
- The food plating was very good but the taste wasn't a \"wow\" but still very good.
- Had the crispy fish, shrimp appetizer and ice cream sandwich

They also have good vegetarian options! Also don't need to drive down to the downtown core and tackle the traffic."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food and service. The cocktails were great, the food even better. Our server made our experience truly exceptional and very attentive and very accommodating. The bill for two came up to about $200 and we felt that anything below a 25% tip would be an insult to their level of service. Very expensive, but well worth the experience. Will definitely come back again on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Wow.  That's all I can say.  Well, not really...I have a lot more to say but that is the first word that comes to mind.  My entire experience at this restaurant was simply superior to any other restaurant I have ever been to and I have been fortunate enough to have been to some pretty nice places, many of them other restaurants in the Oliver & Bonacini group.  

Many other reviews have commented on the atmosphere at Auberge so I won't go into any great detail other than to repeat that this is a very cozy, charming and romantic restaurant.  My girlfriend and I agreed that we must come back with our significant others. 

The service was seamless and superb.  We mentioned to our server that we had tickets to a show at 8 so w couldn't linger and she and the other servers (there were at least 3 that took care of us) ensured that our food was delivered in time for us to enjoy it but not be late for the show.  

On to the food...


Appetizers:  We ordered the Huîtres & Caviar (warm poached oysters, domestic caviar, leek velouté, toasted brioche) and the Foie Gras Poêlé (roasted foie gras, vinegared red cabbage, garni Grand-Veneur, red cabbage consommé).  

Both were \"party in my mouth\" spectacular.  I love foie gras and the portion was generous enough for me to be satisfied with half of it since we shared the apps.  The oysters were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. 

For my main, I ordered the Homard Poché au Beurre Doux (butter-poached Yarmouth lobster, crispy lobster mitts, tasting of garden carrots, coconut rice, sauce vadouvan).  At $59 I think this is the most expensive entree but it was so worth it.  The lobster was cooked perfectly and there was a lot of lobster meat on the plate and in the rice.  The rice was presented on a separate plate with fresh watercress and more lobster meat.  Amazing!

My girlfriend ordered the Chevreuil (venison loin, seeds & nuts, honey glazed roots, crispy polenta, jus d'épices & chocolat).  She was sceptical about the venison because it can taste gamey (according to her) but ended up ordered it on the advice of the server.  It was tender and delicious and not at all gamey.  It was my first time trying venison and I loved it but I suspect that I have now been spoiled by this establishment such that other places will not be able to hold a candle to this dish.  I am not a fan of polenta but loved both the taste and presentation of this part of her entree (it came in a separate little bowl with a lid and was very creamy and tender.  

We did not have time to stay for dessert but our server brought out 2 complimentary french macaroons which were a perfect ending to complement to our meal. 

The entire evening was special and elegant.  From the minute you walk until you leave, the staff at this restaurant go over and above to make your evening memorable.  It was simply the best meal I have probably ever had and I can't wait to go back.  Next time, I will ensure that I can linger over the meal for at least 3-4 hours."}
{"text":"Was there for winterlicious. 
The appetizers were good. We got a soup and a pork plate. 
The main was a little bland - fish. 
Dessert was good but nothing amazing. 
Nice atmosphere, okay service but not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food again this year for Winterlicious! Brought my girlfriends and they were very, very pleased with my choice. Highlights are the salad, duck and creme brulee. I ordered the rillette, oxtail and pave and was very satisfied with my choices. The mini wine add on was very generous and a perfect pair with the meal.

Our server was awesome! He never rushed us and made us feel so comfortable and taken care of. I love that this place doesn't go downhill during Winterlicious!

We also got to meet the pastry chef that night since she was a friend of the table. Loved it! Even with the rush she was completely calm and focused. That must say something about the caliber of the BOH staff :)"}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my mom's birthday. Interior decor is Transitional French design, marriage of traditional and contemporary furniture. Quite lovely and inviting. 

We party of 5 went for the tasting menu.  What a great 2 hours experience!  The food is fresh and the cuisine is meticulously prepared. Perfect portions, beautiful presentation and deliciously good. Outstanding French cuisine!!!

Service is great!  Friendly, professional staff from the front to back.  One of the staff chased us down the street  because we left a water bottle when we left the restaurant.  Not to mention that it was -15 degrees that night. 

Highly, highly, highly recommend this place and their tasting menu.  We will never forget this great experience! We will definitely keep coming back. 

Compared to other higher end dining options, this place is relatively good value for the money!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant in GTA
Although bit pricey, cannot beat the exquisite cuisine, choice of wine, ambiance and service. 
Best for important dates"}
{"text":"Perfection is not enough to describe the food and service of Auberge, a great place to go and enjoy every moment of your night, but remember that you are paying $100-150 per person just for food so there is no place for mistake.
Probebly chef mark is one of the best chefs in the city and loosing him is not a good news for a restaurant, i cant wait for the knew chef and try the new menu.
Good job O&B team, keep it up."}
{"text":"Came for a business dinner and the food and atmosphere was lovely. The staff was extremely attentive, there is coat check, and our wine and water glasses were never near empty (a pet peeve of mine).

I had a vegetable tart for the appy and salmon for my main. Both were perfectly done and exquisite. I highly recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Exquisite. There is no other word. The subtle flavors of the dishes are superb, the wines and the introduction to them of the highest caliber. The ambience soothing, charming yet luxurious. The service exceeded my standards and made my visit truly memorable. As an appetizer the quail dish was perfect. I ordered the beef filet with oxtail stuffed onions and could not have been more pleased. The portion sizes generous, so you will not leave hungry. A delightful visit from beginning to end."}
{"text":"It was my second summerlicious/winterlicious visit here and it still remains as one of my top 10 choices of summerlicious/winterlicious restaurants. It's a beautiful restaurant and the service is  splendid. I've always had a good eating experience here and I would come back. 

Service and Environment
Like I said before, the service is excellent. They try their best to make you feel welcome and treat you like royalty (as expected in any upscale restaurant though). It's a pretty quiet environment as my friends and I often find that even talking in our normal voices seemed a bit too loud. Our food items and drinks also came out really fast. 

Food 
Appetizers:
My friends and I really enjoyed both their Butternut Squash Soup and Pate. The dishes were plated beautifully and both were very appetizing. 

Mains:
The Boeuf Bourguignon was okay. I personally thought the beef was bland. I remember regretting and thinking about how I should have ordered the Atlantic Salmon instead like my friends. The salmon dish tasted much better than the beef dish. The salmon was moist and flavourful and was accompanied with a wonderful Couscous side.

Dessert:
Apple cake with ice cream - This was really really really good! Cake was moist and the ice cream was smooth and creamy.

Meringue mousse - My friend got this and it looked really appetizing! The mousse was nice and smooth and the overall flavour and balance of this dessert dish was wonderful!"}
{"text":"I came here for a special Easter brunch menu which consisted of:

-assorted bread and butter
-Starter: choice between terrine, salade, soupe, or cuisses de grenouilles (salicorne w/ oyster aioli)
-Main: choice between beef tenderloin, quiche alsacienne, truite (poached trout), or mushroom-stuffed Cornish hen
- Dessert: choice between Alsatian apple tart, opera (chocolate & hazelnut ice cream), or fromage

I went with the terrine, hen, and apple tart. The terrine was some of the best I've ever had! The wild boar meet goes well with the duck fat and the poached apple tastes like fresh quince, to add a light flavor to the mix. The sauce is also amazing! 

The hen was the largest size portion of the three choices, but I kind of wish I had gone with the poached trout, since I didn't think there was anything special about the Cornish hen.

Dessert was also a bit below expectations. The apple tart was beautifully presented and the flavor was tasty, but the temperature was lukewarm and completely made the dish underwhelming. I was a bit too embarrassed to ask them to throw it in the microwave for 15 seconds, but that would've made it significantly better.

Overall, it was a good experience, but could've been better with a few tweaks and a couple better choices on my end."}
{"text":"Great disappointment !  What a mess from service, to food, to waiting staffs running around juggling to Tables for various parties. For a $350 meal, we had practically no service, empty water glasses, over cooked steak (asked for rare and was served a well done)! 

Disclaimer:  We went to this ADP during the Winterlicious, but not to taste the Winterlicious menu. We ordered the full menu with drinks and wine!! But was served a meal that we could have eaten at Earls.

Lesson for Auberge Du Pommier:  If you don't have the ability to do Winterlicious, DON'T!  You are attracing the wrong demographics, and are clearly showing the incompetency of your management team.

I am a foodie, and after hearing so much hype about this place, we ventured my way out of Toronto downown to have a taste of Auberge Du Pommier. 

Nothing that I ordered was memorable except the over cooked steak and chaos in the restaurant. Our section had one waiter that serves about 20 people!  The restaurant is so understaffed, everyone was running around. Not a pleasant sight! 

I usually give a restaruant three times to redeem itself befor I completely write it off my list. However, I am so disappointed with this restaurant, I don't even think I can return to ADP. For the same price tag, I will stick to my usualy dining spots at Splendido and Scaramouche! Maybe Auberge Du Pommier and learn from the other pros on how to properly manage their food and service."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious 2015 and had a very pleasant experience. Our table of 4 never felt neglected and the service was great. 

I had the chicken terrine as an appetizer and that was the star of the meal. Truly a memorable dish as the terrine was tender but not as smooth as pate, it had a meaty consistency that simultaneously was hearty and light. I had the beef entree which I thought was also well done. My samplings of the ravioli and the fish proved that their other entrees were also well-done. 

We also splurged and decided to share a bottle of wine. My friends and I have very little wine knowledge and our server was very patient in helping us choose a wine. We settled on a reasonably priced riesling (?) which I think was called Adona from niagara. It was delish! The only takeaway of a star was due to the dessert which I found disappointing. It was called 1,000 leaves dessert...seemed like puff pastry and mousse to me, not impressed. 

The atmosphere is definitely posh, but not intimidatingly so, our server even helped me clean up a small spill I made of our bread spread haha! 

I look forward to trying this place again, perhaps for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I came here for a Winterlicious lunch this year. Granted, I'm fully aware of all the pitfalls of -licious dining, but had heard positive reviews of Auberge du Pommier and was really looking forward to my meal here.

The restaurant itself is beautiful - tucked away amidst a sea of office buildings, I felt like I had stumbled upon the secret garden as I walked up the path to the door. The interior is gorgeous; it looks like a Martha Stewart magazine come to life. All of the hosts and servers that we encountered from the door to our table were extremely pleasant and cordial. 

I started my meal with the Salade du Marché, a delicious combination of mixed greens, shaved beets, minted yogurt, couscous and red wine vinaigrette. The salad was the tastiest part of my meal, which unfortunately began a downward trend from there. For my entree, I had the Ricotta Cavatelli, which had a slightly unappealing \"worm-like\" appearance and consistency and was, in my opinion, slightly underseasoned. I finished with the Chocolat Chaud for dessert, which was so cloyingly sweet that I couldn't even finish the small cup (and I love chocolate!). Dessert also came with two small french crullers which were both slightly undercooked on the inside, though the taste was fine. 

Overall, the meal took nearly two hours from start to finish, which was admittedly slightly surprising. We noticed tables that were seated after us receive their food before we did. My dining companion and I also ordered drinks at the start of our meal which were forgotten about and not delivered to our table until we had finished our appetizers and moved on to our main course. Water was not refilled until requested. Given this restaurant's price point and reputation, there were some flaws in service that are difficult to overlook, and I wasn't particularly blown away by my meal either. As another small point, it was quite cold inside the restaurant, and the washrooms (which are downstairs) were downright freezing. 

Would I return and pay full price? Maybe, but I feel like there are much better places to have an excellent meal."}
{"text":"The worst Winterlicious menu ever this year.... it still leaves a bad memory and I went this past January. The food and service is so over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"A dinner for two. Seated in a plush corner, I came to taste the food.

The tartar was bursting with flavors and was well portioned bites of meat sashimi and why not eat raw meat as a civilized species. My sturgeon was well presented although slightly overcooked and the tiny touches of sauces could make anything taste masterfully created. We also tasted the goose meat which was as soft as goose gets but it was gamey.

Our macaroons at the end did not taste like candy cane or eggnog but we so soft and fresh that they disappeared quickly from the plate. A tea to top off the meal and we were ready to call an end to our dinner.

One entree each: two ppl: Tax +tip: $180"}
{"text":"Summerlicious is an economical way to try out top fine dining restaurants in the GTA fot a great price. Usually it will cost you at least 100$ pp to dine here, all thanks to summerlicious, you can sample their exquisite menu for only 45$pp for a 3 course meal that will have your taste bud thank you later.

1st course : watermelon.... soup? I was expecting a salad when the ingredients includes goat cheese, and croutons. But the watery melon mix is like a slush you drink on a cold day but the hint of goat cheese and croûton suggest its a soup..

2nd: Filet Mignon: The steak itself is pretty small. I would say you only get about 4oz. The tendery goodness just breaks up in your mouth. One of the best filet mignon I've had in the city.

3rd course: Fromage... cheeeseeeeeeeeeee. I was surprised they offered cheese as a dessert instead of appetizer. I'm glad they had it. French meal isn't complete without cheese!

I was never a super big fan of large chain restaurants, but O&B continues to surprise me :)"}
{"text":"This review of Auberge Du Pommier is based on my Summerlicious 2012 experience.

I have been wanting to come here for a meal for the longest time since I have read all these great reviews on Yelp. Summerlicious lunch definitely something that is good value for $25.

Since it is my first time here, I don't realize how lovely their patio is! I would have told my hostess when she asked me what's my seating preference.

Appetizer: Brandade Croquette
- I really enjoyed that, though the portion is really small but the croquette went well with the black olive/red pepper aioli on the side which give it a savoury kick

Main: Mediterranean Sea bass
- I was disappointed as my fish was really overcooked and tasted really bland
- The mussels on the side were not too fresh either
- Saffron sauce though really tasty but would not have save this dish

Dessert: Ice Cream Sandwich
- Nicely plated! Just love the cocoa nib that sprinkled on top
- Just perfect for a hot summer day and especially if you love chocolate!

Service is excellent! Attentive and professional! 

Make sure you have time for a long lunch! My food did take awhile to arrive and my lunch took almost a hour and a half!!

I might come back one day to Auberge Du Pommier for a full dinner experience. One day......."}
{"text":"The ambiance of the venue is great. You'll find friendly people helping you, answering all questions you have.

I had Pork Belly for the appetizer. It was juicy but too much fatty for me. I asked the waitress if I get that one or Foie Gras. She suggested that. I had Foie Gras last time in Auberge and I wasn't impressed. Don't get me wrong, it was a nice dish, but not to my diet. I found it hard to find a nice appetizer if you are not a fishy person.

{"text":"Great service.  Solid changing menu.  Great ambiance.  A favorite for years and will keep coming back.  Avoid this place during wintelicious and summlicious to avoid the crowds"}
{"text":"Nice service, super soft and moist bread. Ordered the shrimp salad crostini, crispy fish brandade and olive oil cake as dessert. Food was well prepared and delicious. Interior design wasn't as elegant and fancy as I had expected. There was also a spider on the wall next to me and 2 flies flying around. Would have given 3-4 stars but reduced to 2 because we parked at the designated AUBERGE DU POMMIER underground parking but they said they only validate after 5pm."}
{"text":"Winterlicious 2018 was disappointing. We came to celebrate my birthday as a family. Food was dry and pretty lack lustre. 

My favourite was the Olive Oil Cake with funnel, and apple sorbet. It was not overly sweet. Great balance of flavour. The tomato bisque is also worthy of a notable mention. 

Aside from that, all other dishes did not pass the Lee family test. 

We were not impressed as our table was set to the side of a pathway. Overall, it was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Been there a while ago. Think I'll still write down something. 

As of food I think this place is good. But I do think a full set of dining experience would include environment, service, etc. Or just overall feeling in summary.  

The waitress was rude. When I pulled out my card from the machine too fast it didn't get processed and she literally just said, in a rude tone, \"don't pull out the card until I tell you to ok?\" 

I gave tips for some reason, maybe social convention or something but I really regret it. Tips should only be given to nice or at least standard service. It's not big $ but I don't feel good about it.  

Anyways, I don't like my dinning experience there. Wouldn't recommend. There's no point a restaurant staff can think their place is some sort of privilege and just treat ppl badly."}
{"text":"Came with a friend for  a summerlicious lunch two years ago and were left impressed. The food was presented well, quantities were generous, servers were very attentive.  We felt like we were in  France for the duration of  our meal .    Auberge has the best breadbasket  which came with hot bread and an artichoke dip. We loved it so much we asked for another  round of bread. Add Auberge to your list of places to dine at for licious and regular menu."}
{"text":"I had a 2016 Winterlcious lunch here ($28 for 3 courses) with my hubby. We had a good experience.
I love the ambiance here, so intimate which makes it a perfect place for a romantic date. 
Complimentary bread was warm, very standard, nothing to rave about. 

1. Appetizer: we both had  Pâté de Campagne (pork pâté). This was quite good and nicely presented. 

2. Main course: we both had Boeuf Bourguignon (braised beef cheeks). This was delicious and flavourful. Portion seems small but its quite rich and filing. We both enjoyed the beef cheeks very much. I would strongly recommend it. 

3. Desserts:
Vacherin aux Grenade: home made ice cream served with meringue and pomegranate pearls. It was good but it didn't wow me. The ice cream was good but the pom pearls were a bit \"stale\" 
Gâteaux aux Amandes (almond cake), this was better opinion IMO. I would recommend this dessert. 

Service was attentive, typically fine dining. 

Overall, excellent service, very good food; price is typically on the high side which makes Winterlcious am excellent deal. I would recommend it for a special event or a romantic date"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed the tasting menu. My waiter Tony W. was attentive and entertaining. I would happily recommend this meal to my friends."}
{"text":"Auberge du Pommier is the best provincial French restaurant in Toronto as far as I am concerned, and there are lots of such places.  The meals are pricey, but there is a minimum of three courses and eating there is well worth it and worth the wait if there's a queue.  Like most French places, they serve seafood and fowl, beef and other dishes; an entire selection.  Great for families, too, given the occasion."}
{"text":"Took my wife for her birthday since she loves French food. Very high end but not pretentious. If you are young and casual it wouldn't be the place for you. I would say it is formal, tie off kind of place. Atmosphere was nice, not loud. The food was great but I have had better French cuisine in Toronto. The wife loved the food though and it was her opinion that counted. Service was excellent and personable. The hostess was fantastic. It was busy on a Monday. I would recommend definitely."}
{"text":"I had organized my parents 40th Anniversary dinner there. I appreciated the call the day from the hostess. Where she happily accommodated my request to hide the prices on the menu for my parents, as I wanted them to indulge with out any reservations. Our waiter was amazing; he was attentive, patient, and helpful. We all enjoyed how the cook staff came out & explained each dish we had ordered and answered any questions we had.
I would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"We went for winterlicious lunch. The menu was not very clear.. the chicken turned out to be sausage..  overall the food was average. I don't understand all the good comments.  Will not go back. It is kind of overrated."}
{"text":"I came with a good friend for my birthday during summerlicious. Overall I feel as though it was very much worth the experience. 

Food: I started off with the soup, found that the melon gazpacho was room temperature and slightly sour. It tasted as though the contents might have began going bad, as it was made of fruit, after sitting out for too long. For my entree I had the steak, and it was DELICIOUS. If it's not the best steak I've ever eaten, then it's tied for it. It was just the right amount of soft & chewy with enough toughness to be easily cut. Although, I ordered medium rare, they cooked it to a medium. The dessert was pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of mousse but my chocolate craving needed to be satisfied. *sidebar* they gave us two rounds of bread which were warm & fresh tasting, I loved it.

Service: We weren't seated until 20 minutes after our reservation. I was told that they were running behind schedule & so that was why there was a delay. Our server was nice & attentive. Food came relatively quickly (I'm assuming it was all pre-made) which was great considering how hungry we were. Maybe it was because it was such a busy day, but I didn't feel super welcomed by the staff. 

Environment: The French architecture really bleeds through with the style of the wall. The bricked archway & windows gave the place a cottage-y vibe along with the tresses of the entryway. I loved the amount of candles, they added to the ambience of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"For my end-of-term farewell lunch, I had the pleasure of going to Auberge du Pommier with my work team. I previously came here for a Summerlicious lunch, so this time I was extremely excited to order à la carte this time!

I ordered a tangerine juice, but they mistakenly brought me pumpkin pear one. I didn't even realize the mistake because the ginger spiced pumpkin pear juice was so delicious! I preferred it over the tangerine juice. Everything, including our drinks, were impeccably presented. 

We were served a warm bread basket with a creamy artichoke dip. The dip was very tasty.

For my appetizer, I chose oeuf en cocotte: steamed egg white, soft yolk, creamed spinach, jus de poulet, les petits soldats croquant. This was really good! The soft yolk was lovely with the spinach and the egg white. My only complaint was that there wasn't enough bread sticks to accompany the shirred eggs, which was a little too rich on its own.

For my main, I went with Brandade de Flétan: gratin of halibut brandade, toasted baguette, petite herb salad. I didn't particularly enjoyed the petite herb salad, as it was a little too bitter.  The halibut brandade was very creamy and rich, but not overly fishy. After my starter, this entrée was a little too heavy for me. Again, there weren't enough toasted baguettes to go with the brandade, so I had to eat some of it with the bread from the bread basket. 

To finish off the meal, I ordered a Parfait Châtaigne: chestnut semifreddo with puffed wild rice, lemon meringue, marron glacé, cassis caramel. I normally love chestnuts, but this dessert was way too sweet for me. It was texturally very interesting with the puffed wild rice and meringue. However, in terms of flavours, it was sweet on sweet on sweet. I almost had difficulty finishing it, despite the small portion.  

I was very full after the meal! Although all the courses had small portions, everything I ordered was very rich and filling. In spite of this, I really enjoyed my lunch."}
{"text":"Came here for a wedding and it was a beautiful event. Most importantly, the food was very good and the service was also very good. I was particularly impressed by the fact that I was able to choose the doneness of my beef, because normally for events where huge parties are being served, you don't have an option. The hors d'oeuvres looked incredible, but I arrived around the tail end of cocktail hour so I didn't really get to have any. Besides that, I was deep into the room and the guests near the door would surround servers as they entered with the hors d'oeuvres, so I was basically shit out of luck. If I ever get invited to a wedding here again, I will position myself better!

For those thinking of planning an event here, the space is so beautiful that you really don't need to do anything to it. But my friend loves flowers, so she had the place covered in flowers, which was stunning. It's hard to have room to mill about without getting into the servers' ways though, if you're a party of 70 or so. This place is more suited to intimate events.

I really like this place, it's been on my wish list forever, I look forward to coming back for a regular meal, and I can fully understand why this is a long-standing Toronto institution! The quality is consistent over the years - all the fine dining connoisseurs I know tell me this place is always dependably good - you'll never get negative surprises here."}
{"text":"This place is magical. The food is exquisite and beautifully prepared and the service is next to none."}
{"text":"Loved the service and atmosphere. 

The food was amazing. I ordered duck confit and creme brulee in addition to a salad (I can only remember it was sweet, but not the specific name)

I am a pretty picky eater and the place had everything that I looked for in a restaurant. Obviously... the price is pretty high, but it's all worth it."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite place few years ago, as I would come here with my fiancé quite often for our special occasions. I still remember the first time I had dinner there - I was truly amazed by the level of sophistication in their cuisines. Besides our regular visits, we also tried their summerlicious several times for fun. They were OK and I understand that's the case for every restaurant, as you get what you paid for. 

However, their quality went down in the past few years. For once, I had a foie that was slightly subpar.  I even had food poisoning one time after having their summerlicious menu (probably from the mushrooms). But I had so much great memories at Auberge! So I bumped up the scores (I was going to give them a three because of the food poisoning), and I truly hope that they can get back to where they were before."}
{"text":"Auberge is a cozy, fancy French restaurant. Cozy because the chairs are like coffee sofas as if you could bury yourself in a book. Intimate, the soft lighting and gentle demeanour of the servers. It also looks like a peaceful B&B from the outside. 

I didn't come for any of the 'licious menus. We came for full-price dinner and to experience Auberge at its finest.

St. Jacques scallops $27
giant scallops seared to perfection, with a bit of salad. The current menu may be different now, but ours had a seaweed-covered brioche and sea urchin. This is still the most delicious dish I've ever had. Photo:

Foie Gras $28
It's like a little painting, it's really beautiful. You can, like me, scoop everything up and taste all the flavours in your mouth. You can also start with the foie gras and work your way to the edge. It starts from salty and ends with sweet.

Agneau $45 is lamb loin and braised shoulder
Buf $52 is beef filet and braised oxtail

We never felt rushed as the restaurant became busy. They came with the next dish at the right moment. The dishes don't arrive back-to-back. They let you enjoy the dinner, let you finish at your own pace, let you chat a bit, THEN take away the empty dish, let you chat a little bit again before serving the next dish at a comfortable eating temperature. Thank you!! Good food as well as a lovely dining experience."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant! Extremely polite and knowledgeable staff! Food perfection. Only thing I would change their Bloody Caesar drink with wine, keep it original! Everything else is perfect! Special occasions!"}
{"text":"Had really high hopes for this place considering the high ratings, popularity, and the fact that they even host weddings. Food was definitely good, but not worth the price at all. I came here for the Valentine's Day 7 course meal. I think I was only really impressed with 2 of them. The pasta entree was delicious! The pre-dessert was a small slice of crepe cake, which was good, but I've had better. Overall, spent about a month worth of grocery money on a meal for two, and I just don't feel like it was justified...

The ambience, however was veryyy romantic. They even set up a candy station so people can take away candy at the end of their meal. Everything was very presentable, which makes for good photos."}
{"text":"Came here with the husband for our one year anniversary dinner. Impeccable service and our server made some great recommendations. We tried the agneau and ducks or our main course, both were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The champignons side dish was definitely the highlight of the night. Will be coming back for every anniversary. There is complementary parking validation if you park in the underground lot."}
{"text":"One of Toronto's other diamond restaurants......when perfect is important..."}
{"text":"First time here and the experience was wonderful. Lunch menu for winterlicious. Both service and food were high quality. Because of the wait for our entree, the manager offered a complimentary cup of wine."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service!!

I had the Halibut gratin for apps, it was really yummy, I must say. I was never a huge fan of fish, but after having halibut in this format and having the Roasted Seabass for my main, I'm starting to really like fish. The roasted seabass was my favourite. It was very tender and juicy, not over or undercooked, it was just right, and it was served with pomme fourchette which was AMAZING. So delicious. Pretty presentation too :)

For dessert I got the chocolate fudge with sorbet, which I forgot what it's called on the menu, but it was very refreshing.

The whole ambiance was pleasant. It's great for romantic dinner or taking clients. Definitely a grown-ups place. Very proper.

Bathrooms are downstairs and they were decent. There's coat check as well, which is great during winter.

Overall, I would give this place 5/5. I fully recommend."}
{"text":"Walking up the stone path bordered by lush pink and white flowers behind a white archway laid to a welcoming open french door, I was already in love with this enchanting cottage like restaurant.

We arrived a bit early for our summerlicious dinner reservation however the courteous hostess was able to seat us right away. We were lead to a dining room in rear of the restaurant to an intimate table for two perfectly set in front of a windowsill looking into the garden.

Soon after being seated our friendly waiter came over to introduce himself and explained the menus.

For drinks we went with a feature wine on the summerlicious menu. Our waiter raved about it as he took our drink order for 2 glasses of rose and he was right it was refreshing and delicious.

After taking our dinner orders we were then presented with some fresh baked golden brown dinner rolls with a flakey exterior and chewy interior. I adored the artichoke spread it came with, it was unlike anything I've ever had before.

Onto the summerlicious offerings:

Appetizer
Spinach Salad - pickled strawberries, pine nuts, goat cheese mousse, balsamic vinaigrette
I really enjoyed the sweet and sour taste of the pickled strawberries but my favourite part of the salad was the goat cheese sprinkled with cracked black pepper for a little bit of heat.

Main
Filet Mignon -tomato farci, pomme fourchette, chimichurri à la Maurice, sauce Bordelaise
The filet was cooked perfectly and so tender to cut through that the simple dinner literally cut through it like butter needless to say it was melt in your mouth perfection. The stuffed tomatoes and homemade ketchup were also stand out accompaniments.

Dessert
Ice Cream Sandwich - chocolate chip cookie, vanilla bean ice cream, nutella, candied hazelnuts
I loved the plating of the dish very fairytale like, it looked like 3 little mushrooms with the ice cream as the stump and the chocolate chip cookies topped as the mushroom cap and the \"dirt\" as the nutella and chocolate crumbles A great finally to wonderful meal.

Overall I have to say the meal was amazing! The portions at first to me did look a tad on the small side but I was completely stuffed by the end! Food came out very fast and service was very professional and attentive. The restaurant itself is very romantic and gorgeous. A definite summerlicious winner!"}
