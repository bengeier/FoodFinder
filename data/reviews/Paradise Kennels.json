{"text":"We've used Paradise Kennels several times.  Each time has been outstanding.  From the pickup to the drop-off, to the daily videos, it is all fantastic.  We visited Paradise Kennels before we used them the first time, and we were very happy with the quality and care they put into their facility.  We've used other kennels for short-term stays, but nothing comes close to the quality of Paradise Kennels.  We came home from our holiday late last night, and our two dogs were delivered back to us today, clean and very tired.  They have a great time, and we have great peace-of-mind."}
{"text":"I've always been very happy with Paradise Kennels for my large breed dog. I love the daily videos you post on your Facebook, the taxi is always on time and such an awesome convenience, my dog is always thrilled to get in the taxi and go - only down side is how depressed she looks when she gets home!"}
{"text":"We recently had to board our dog for the first time.  We researched a couple kennels in the Calgary area and this one was the winner.

The Kennel is located about an hour east of the city but this shouldn't be a deterrent for using their services - they offer pick-up and drop off at no extra charge! (except that you have to pay for the extra days, I suppose)

Since we had never boarded a dog before, we wanted to go visit the location.  It is located out in the country with large fields and a pond for swimming - there is no traffic for dogs to run into.

She assured us that the dog would only be in the kennel during meal times, nap time and at night for sleeping.  The rest of the time, the dogs are either outside in size appropriate pens (separated based on dog size/temperament) or if it's too cold or wet to be outside, Jennifer has a fully heated very large hanger with rubber flooring where they dogs can play inside.

The dogs are also provided with off-leash walks in the field and pond during the day.

Jennifer loves her job and it shows in how she cares for your dog."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I am fully disappointed in this organization. The taxi driver decided to leave my dog in my front yard on a plus 26 day with out any confirmation that i would be there to retrieve him. When I called to have the situation rectified I was told this  as my fault and hung up on. That is not a professional way to deal with customers. Also my dog could have been stolen. I do not recommend them to anyone now."}
