{"text":"Wow, Savera is amazing. My \"go to\" Indian place in the area for a few years has been Banjara, but this first visit to Savera has me rethinking that opinion. The interior is small, but quite pleasant and, while the patio is smaller, it's set back from St. Clair enough to feel nice.

The food, thought... the food is spectacular! I had malai kofta that was so rich and delicious that I can't wait to try more off their menu. The garlic naan was delicious and they had the best veggie pakoras that I've seen in a long time.

I wasn't presented a wine / drink menu, mentioned by other reviewers - but I will definitely be returning to Savera and will hopefully enjoy a nice glass of red with my amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the butter chicken. The whole meal was delicious and service was excellent and attentive. Had their house specialty which was a lamb, which we enjoyed (it had more of a kick than the butter chicken). Will definitely be back or order delivery."}
{"text":"My favourite Indian place in Toronto. I've been going here for years, although less frequently now because their prices have gone up.

But, the dishes are amazingly flavourful. The palak paneer and butter chicken leave us wanting to lick the plates.  Everything i've tried here is delicious.

It's family run, which I like. The restaurant itself it cozy.

The portions could be bigger/the prices could be lower."}
{"text":"Some of the tastiest Indian food I've been able to find in TO. The curries are excellent, and the naan is great. Service has seemed fine, though mostly have gone with friends when we've enjoyed talking, and so slower rather than faster service was greatly appreciated. Have never felt rushed at Savera, which is a big plus.
The only problem is the salt, as a previous poster noted. Not really noticeable in the food, which tastes great at the time -- the dishes are very well balanced (and have ruined me for a couple of old favourite Indian restaurants where the food tastes a lot less good in comparison). But after eating, we puff up like beach balls from the salt."}
{"text":"Dear Savera,

I'm going to to give you a solid four stars, but on the condition that you go a little more easy on the salt next time.

Otherwise the decor is good, the service is good and the food is good.

Other than being too salty, the curries were good; the naan was also good but could have been more fluffy.

Maybe, they were trying to make up for Gary's bad review on the service, because the servers were very attentive. The restaurant also has a nice family feel. We were there around 8 on a Friday night and the wait staff and kitchen staff outnumbered the diners by about two to one."}
{"text":"We went there on a yelp adventure and we were not disapointed, we had chicken pakora and onion biaji as starters, the food was very fresh and delicious, we has the butter chicken and lamb tikka massala both were delicious and reminded me of the flavours I had when I was in dehli."}
{"text":"Oh WOW -- this place is great! Everything from the ambience and service to the food -- the fantastic food -- made me happy.

Everything we ordered, from the naan to the raita to the main dishes was as hot and fresh as it could possibly be, and everything was delicious. We tried the tandoori chicken (white meat), as per the recommendations from other Yelpers and it was great, as was the lamb stew -- and I generally don't like lamb anything. We also tried the eggplant dish, which was delish.

The only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is that I found everything to be a touch too salty -- just a touch. 

Oh, and a warning for those of you who can't handle the heat: their food definitely has a kick to it, and I'd say it's just perfect for someone who knows and likes Indian food. My bet is that if you ask for things to be cooked a bit less spicy, they'd do it no problem."}
{"text":"Food: pretty damned good

overall experience: lousy. Slow service is forgivable. Rude service is not.

We were seated fairly quickly but we had to wait quite a while to get menus and water (after asking the wait staff several times). When the waiter came to take our order he mumbled something about appetizers and when my sister started ordering her main course he interrupted her by loudly saying \"I asked for appetizers\". The food came at a decent time but once they were on the table we were ignored and couldn't even order drinks. we just stuck with what little water we had until the end of the meal. When it came time to pay we had to wait at least 10 minutes to get our bill. We probably would have waited even longer waiting for the credit card machine but I got fed up and just went to the bar to pay.

Everyone else there seemed to be enjoying their experience so I'm not sure if we just got the pissed off waiters or what.

Also who charges for papadums?

The food was actually pretty good but a bit on the pricey side. I might recommend this place for takeout so long as you don't have to talk to the waiter we had."}
{"text":"We discovered Savera through it's stellar reviews in Yelp and reviews were not wrong. This is a little gem on the busy St Clair restaurant strip, not to be missed. The food was delicious - we ordered the Vegetarian Briyani, Mutton Tikka Masala,  and the Chicken Tawa. Served with a hot toasty basket of garlic naan. We would've stayed on the nice little patio except for the bee that wouldn't leave my refreshing mango lassi alone :-) We moved inside to the tastefully decorated dining room. The wait staff was efficient and gracious,  In fact, we chatted with the owner and told him all about his reviews on Yelp - he was surprised his restaurant got so many positive comments! Well deserved and I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Every once in a while, my mom decides she's too lazy to cook and I decide I'm too lazy to buy groceries - and we both instantly know, tonight is a night for indian food.

We always order the same thing. Butter chicken and mutton korma. They are HEAVEN. We always get take-out, and the wait is excruciating! Nothing makes me happier than sitting down to the amazingly bright and flavourful butter chicken, eaten on top of warm, soft naan. Best Indian I've had, I think. They also have a lovely, cozy dining room.

Only flaw is I wish they did delivery, and not just take-out. Once we leave the house to pick it up... we always feel bad that we didn't just walk the block further to the grocery store!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for Indian so we decided to try take out from this place. Everything was delicious and fresh. We ordered 6 or 7 dishes and everything was great, no complaints. We were worried because we placed the large order close to the restaurant closing time, but they still took the time to properly prepare our food. They're garlic naan was the best I've ever had! Will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"Here I am, Good Friday, no food in the house, and a hankering for Indian. I haven't had Indian food since moving to Toronto last year (mostly due to the expense, but also because I've had some really bad Indian in the past and did not want to repeat the experience). Based on the reviews here, I decided to try out this place which is conveniently right up the street from my house. And, boy, am I glad I did.

I placed an order for pick-up over the phone and picked it up with-in 20 minutes. I then had to walk the 10 minutes back to my house. To my delight, the food was still very warm.

I ordered: nan, palak paneer, butter chicken, and plain pulao rice. I also got a coke! :D (Not relevant, except perhaps to cost-evaluation). 

Portion: I definitely over-ordered for myself this time. Take-out containers were full, while I was expecting them to be only partially so. I've currently eaten maybe a quarter of the palak paneer, a quarter of the butter chicken, half the rice, and half the nan and I am FULL. And I eat A LOT. (Please note the use of All-Caps).

Quality: Well, I'm no expert, but it was delicious. Aromatic, flavourful, but also not overpowering/over-spiced. Sauces were not watery, rice was surprisingly delicious. chicken was not dry. Nan was a LITTLE doughy but that may also be a result of my walk home. All in all, pretty great. Note on Spice though: While the dishes all provided a good amount of flavour, I got them \"medium\"  and didn't find it particularly hot. I think next time I will go for \"hot.\"

Value: Overall, my whole meal came out to $35 (with tax, no tip) but it would definitely have been enough for two people. In my case, it should last me another couple meals (always good on a student budget). 

Extra cute: They gave me two...I don't know...some kind of dessert? They are like little doughnut balls...(possibly Gulab Jaman - according to the menu). There are two in each container (I think they assumed I was not only ordering for myself). These are very sweet, but not sickeningly so? Interesting to be sure, although I'm not certain I would order them on my own, but it was a nice surprise to try it out for free!

Staff: While my interaction with staff was brief, they were all very polite and friendly.

Overall: Very pleasant experience, I'd totally go back and sit in the restaurant the next time just to see how that experience is! Also, this will become my recommendation for Indian in the area."}
{"text":"Hey, my last review was filtered -- because it was too positive?  Because it was one of the first of this restaurant? But since every review of Savera bears out what I said last year, I'd like to repeat -- this is great Indian food in a comfortable casual place.  We been dozens of times since my first review, and never ever had a bad meal.  Wonderful spice blends, delicate, firey, you name it.  They've since got a liquor license.  But I hope you won't try it because now we can't get in... lineups!"}
{"text":"NOTE: *******rating not based on food!***************

Don't get your heart set on ordering for delivery after reading these reviews... On a Saturday night, they have no driver for delivery. :-(  Disappointing. And unlike another Yelper, I'm not willing to spring for a taxi. I'm going to walk to the nearest Indian- though likely it will not be nearly as good.... these reviews really had me excited."}
{"text":"We ordered take out but wanted it delivered but was told they couldn't  because they had no driver. Because of these reviews (and the fact we were craving Indian) food we took a taxi over to pick it up! I must say the extra costs was so worth it!

We ordered:
- butter chicken (super delicious, not too tangy, well seasoned)
- lamb vindaloo (just ok...my gf loves lamb and found the cut of neat they used to be chewy/fatty and it was not spicy)
- plain rice (they give u a very small container for $3.50 that makes it unlikely you'll get more than 1 serving per 2 ppl)
- veggie samosas (total WOW, crunchy ends, well seasoned filling)
- raita (excellent)

Overall everything was good except for the lamb dish. They were very friendly on the phone but I hope they get their act together with the delivery service- especially on a Friday night.

Will order again!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to even try to figure out the names of what we ordered. There was some lamb, some cauliflower and potatoes, an order of a bunch of garlic naan, some chicken vindaloo.

Listen, I'm no Indian cuisine visheShajny , but I enjoyed all of the food thoroughly. Not overbearingly spicy - but still hot and flavourful. 

The service was a little weird, took a long time for drinks, opened the patio garage door as we were leaving (instead of as we sat down), and was a little pushy in terms of what we ordered - but everything was satisfactory in the end. 

Also, average bathroom rating for this establishment came in at a solid 2.875/5 with a standard deviation of 1.56.    

Would certainly come again, uncle."}
{"text":"Un très bon restaurant indien dans ce coin un peu perdu de St Clair Ave West. Avec comme voisin un sushi et un restaurant péruvien, le passant à l'embarras du choix. Qu'importe, nous savions grâce à Yelp que la réputation des lieux n'était plus à faire. Avaient-ils raison ? Oui, oui et oui ! C'est excellent, relevé, raffiné, léger en goût et des portions généreuses. Nous y avons mangé un palak paneer, un ragoût de lentilles et de haricots rouges, des crevettes et une quantité de naan - tout était au-delà de nos espérances. Nous y retournerons, c'est clair !"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, the food here is excellent. I've eaten here a few times and the food has always been delicious. However, for the first time tonight I ordered takeout and the order for butter chicken w/ rice and naan bread was $22.50. I've eaten at other Indian cuisine restaurants around the city and I expect to pay around 15 or 16 dollars for good Indian food. But $22.50 is a little ridiculous I think."}
{"text":"Terrific food. No driver for take out though right now. Hopefully they fix that."}
{"text":"We love Savera. Portions are small but the food is so rich you don't need big servings (and when did quantity equate quality? Looking at you, Meena).  As a neighbourhood joint it's great; a family business not run by yuppies or their blogger-friends, slightly cheaper than Banjara and 100% less sketchy. 

We loved the Dahl, aloo gobi, the pakoras were so yummy and not greasy, butter chicken, madras chicken, josh rogan - haven't had a bad meal there! Go to Pukka if you want people who care about your bespoke baby gear and how good your Instagram feed is; this is a family restaurant with honest, good and straightforward food."}
{"text":"Butter chicken from heaven......assume it is all low cal!"}
{"text":"We have eaten a few times and we were not disappointed.
I think they could afford to go a little heavier on the spice.

I've had the Paneer dishes and they are fantastic, sometimes a tad oily. I've had the Chicken Tikka too, it came on a big crackling plate and it tasted good, but lacked spice and seemed just a bit overdone. But overall the food is delicious and the service was great. 

The portions were just right for everyone eating, with a bit left over."}
{"text":"Savera was a delightful discovery on St. Clair: great food, fantastic Indian taste and friendly service.

We ordered a variety of dishes (rice along with 2 types of curry dishes) along with the meat-stuffed naan bread which was fantastic. The flavor of the dishes was perfect which I should have known from the delicious aroma when we walked in.

Will definitely return. Go St. Clair!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I ordered the saag kofta with garlic naan for takeout and I must say this place has some great things going for it, and some things that might explain why it seems even on a friday night, most of their dinner business appears to be takeout.

The curry itself was delicious. Had a nice flavour, the koftas were big and plump (I actually thought they gave me the potato one by mistake at first) and the spice is just right (if you prefer your curry spicier I'd recommend saying so when you order cause for indian this is on the milder side). The garlic naan however was disappointing...it barely tasted like garlic and I've had much better naan elsewhere in the city. If I'm paying almost $5 for naan, it better be amazing! Should also note that unlike some indian places, their curries do not include a choice of rice or naan automatically, so you are paying 4-5 bucks on top of the listed price for curry.
Portions are very big, but not unusual as most indian places I find you can easily get one curry and have it for two meals. 

The family who runs it seems very lovely though, attentive and had a warm presence. Unfortunately I think when you start charging almost $20 for indian food (no desserts or apps even for that price), you are really limiting the scope of guests who'd come on a regular basis (hence why there were barely any sit-in diners... considering you'd have to pay tip on top of that price)."}
{"text":"This neighbourhood really needed an Indian place and thankfully Savera filled that void.  It's a small place with only a handful of tables but it's clean and tastefully decorated.  I started off with their pakora which were perfectly cooked.  For mains, tried both the king prawn masala (terrific flavour but was surprised that it was a dry curry) and the chicken dupiaza (moist and succulent).  And their basmati rice was beautifully cooked.  All the dishes were nicely seasoned and had multiple layers of flavours (nothing was one note).  The food took a small while to come out but I wasn't complaining at all as I'm well aware that good food takes time to make (I'd rather wait a little while for fantastic food than something quick yet mediocre).  The service was also very polite and friendly but I liked how they weren't overly intrusive.  I've been to some Indian places where they would ask me half a dozen times how the food was and I felt like telling them to back off.  A fantastic place overall."}
{"text":"Welp, this is disappointing.  The butter chicken is now too sweet and they no longer add spice to it."}
{"text":"Oh Savera, Savera, Savera.  Such sanguine stillness passed, as anticipatory hopes of a succulent Indian snack spot would suddenly spring to surface on our sacrosanct stretch of St. Clair.  So swept with satisfaction, were we to discern that our hopes for splendiferous magnificence were struck with scrumptious, savoury sureness and surety.

Like Julianna B said...St. Clair has been hurting for Indian food...so glad this showed up and so sad like so many others, we never tried it earlier. 

To me, Savera is a Phoenix on the little pseudo-dining-strip-mall that is it's location.  Where once was DGanz (a great little steakhouse that made an AWESOME valued and super tasty steak and eggs weekend Baruch), out of the Tandoor fire is born Savera.  Oh what a fire.

Is it the best Indian food I've had?  That's so hard to say, as with Indian, you order so many dishes that are so different, that some end up being spectacular, some great, and some less than the excellence that might have become the standard for your level of expectation because of the potential for greatness tasted in a select few dishes.

That being said...overall, this restaurant is fine.  Fair priced, great location (if you're in the 'hood), and some best of breed stuff that makes it worth the journey.

===============
AMBIANCE
===============
The restaurant is small maybe 12 small tables with a small patio.  Dark decor, nice and casual.

===============
PRICE
===============
Average.  Indian food is not cheap.  You will not go far if you are looking for something under $10 for dinner.  With large servings for big eaters, we hit just over $25/person including tax and a small tip for a pickup order.  

===============
HOURS
===============
They open early for dinner on Sunday...perfect for cranky kids who need to eat by 5pm.

===============
BIG HITS
===============
MALAI KOFTA -  Although you only get 3 of the cheese koftas, they are quite large and suitable for halving.  The sauce?  You'd be shocked and appalled at the stuff I'd dip in this to scrape up the last drop on the plate.

MUTTON KORMA -  Very tender, rich cashew sauce, wonderful

BAINGAN MASALA (EGGPLANT) - It's great.  REALLY good.  It's not like the Baingan Bharta from Banjara...very different...but really tasty...a nice smoky flavour, and rich smooth texture.

RICE (MATTER PULAO) - This is the rice cooked with ghee, spices and a few peas.  This is really good.  Believe it or not...not plain basmati.  This had a wonderful smoky overtone to it...that really was quite good.

NAAN - We tried all the naan's...and they were tasty.  Nice texture, no burnt or dry edges...very good.


===============
TASTY BUT MEDIOCRE
===============
This is a funny section for me...because I'm comparing it to some dishes I call life changing.

BUTTER CHICKEN - Some have raved on it, I say it's tasty.  Order it...it's good...but a bit heavy on the tomato for my liking.  If I had not discovered Banjara's butter chicken, which is so good it could raise the dead, I would consider this excellent...but Banjara's butter chicken has ruined my ability to enjoy any other version of it.  If Savera called it something else, I would probably rate it excellent.  

CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA - Not your usual version in a rich, generous sauce, but one that is visually like a Chinese sweet and sour pork (but definitely not tasting like it), and low on the cream/coconut milk.  Not as complex a masala composition as I've tasted elsewhere...but still alright.  

VEGGIE PAKORAS - These were ok...but not great.  To be fair, we ordered takeout...and Pakoras really can't be had on takeout, buffet tables, or when cold.  They need to be had straight from the fryer to the table after just enough time to drain the dripping Frymax to make it presentable on the table.  Maybe I'll have to try them fresh at the resto."}
{"text":"3.5. I'd like to come back and try a few other dishes. Service was friendly and very efficient. Our server made sure to make our food extra spicy even though we ordered the standard white people butter chicken and Palak Paneer with Tandoori shrimp. I am quite familiar with Indian food and cook it at home often, so bland is not an option. 

The free papadums were nice.  a lot of places don't give these out. We were very hungry, so this little snack quelled our grumbly bellies.

Everything was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Savera keeps changing and growing!  The dishware is prettier than on my last visit, and they've sprouted a liquor license - a couple of wines and some lagers are now on offer.

It's looking like the menu is going to be solid - the paneer is still great, and our chicken dish (argh, can't recall the name) was amazing.  Next time, I'm telling you, we're getting the chicken tandoori.  We saw about three tables order big sizzling cast-iron platters of it, and we watched with unconcealed envy."}
{"text":"This is the MOST AMAZING Indian restaurant I have been to in ages. No actually, it is the MOST AMAZING restaurant that I have been to all year. Every food item was DELICIOUS. I had the urge to lick not only my plate, but my friends as well. But, didn't want to get any unwanted looks so I tried to get every last bit with my spoon. I think I could live on this food for life. It's true, the price does come to about $25 per person - but folks, don't let that dissuade you from coming to Savera. Save that coffee money - and use it here. You will not be disappointed. I promise. 

For appetizer: Aloo Tikki, potatoes topped with an orgasmic sauce. I don't know what is in it - and I don't care. It was the beginning to an amazing assortment of food. 

Entree: Okra Masala - OMG! The spices, the okra, the right amount of heat near toppled me off the seat!

Paneer Makani - I could have swam in that dreamy gravy all night long. But, I saved it for my buttery naan instead. 

Yum. Yum. Yum. 

Yes, mam! You can count your Aunt Fannie that I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian food I've had in toronto

I do t think you can go wrong with any of the dishes but definitely try the butter chicken and lamb biryani. 

I'd say each takeout dish serves two people but if you're REALLY hungry, get 2 dishes.

You can then go eat it by the bluffs beach which is close by and enjoy you're yum yums"}
{"text":"A delicious home made Indian place. Family run and friendly staff make this a cozy place to eat. Their curries are absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced. This is our go-to Indian in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Severa is a quaint little restaurant with a friendly authentic feel to it and friendly staff.
The food is pretty good, may not be the best Indian cuisine I ever had but decent.
The palak paneer was great, the butter chicken just average.
It felt like the restaurant cooks were playing it safe. Not spicy, just the usual Indian flavours.
So bottom line, food is ok maybe 3 stars but the atmosphere is 4.
However, I will go again."}
{"text":"Don't believe the people who talk about small portions. My husband and I are big eaters and we always leave here with leftovers. We've tried quite a few dishes and loved them all. Service has been friendly and obliging. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I live in the area and often visit this restaurant for either din in or take out. On a Friday takeout can take up to an hour but on a not busy night is much quicker. Regardless it is worth ordering ahead as the food is delicious we generally get the mixed vegetable curry and butter chicken. Although butter chicken isn't the most adventurous order it is extremely delicious!! I sometimes wish I could just drink the sauce. I've had other items on the menu and have never been disappointed including lamb and vegetarian dishes. All delicious, fresh, quality ingredients and great taste!!"}
{"text":"Had the best butter chicken I've ever had. Ambience is great too and staff are friendly. This is a good date place. I'll be back and bring my friends."}
{"text":"5 stars here denotes \"Woohoo! As good as it gets\".

And that really IS the case with Savera. My partner and I (TH) recently had our second visit.

Our first visit was a smashing success, with friendly service and absolutely wonderful food (and contrary to her review, I don't remember the service being slow - but my memory might fail me).

The second visit was more of the same. The Malai/Paneer Kofta was fantastic again - completely consistent with the first visit. 

The only Malai Kofta that compares, is the 5th Element Kofta, which is COMPLETELY different, thus I can appreciate them both for their uniqueness in the same way that I love both Tim Burton's Batman and Christopher Nolan's.

I just compared Savera to Batman... I mean seriously, do you need a better endorsement?

Why are you still reading this? Aren't you hungry yet?"}
{"text":"We might consider going back here, but it's not likely to appear on the list of places we regularly frequent.

Food: 3.5/5
We tried two dishes: the okra masala and goan coconut curry. The okra was perfectly cooked. I was a little less impressed with the curry; it was fine, but I didn't think it was very distinct from the more generic northern masala curries - no coconut flavour at all. The shrimp were themselves tasty and juicy, but six shrimp is kind of skimpy for the price. The rice was nicely cooked, but the roti wasn't very good (and, as the manager randomly volunteered in explaining why the roti was delayed, it was frozen before we ate it?)

Service: 2/5
The manager who served us was really good about filling up the water, but his presence was a bit oppressive; too many suggestions for drinks, dessert, more purchases. The shrimp curry and rice came quickly, but we then waited quite a while for the okra and roti. This was tolerable, but when we noticed that the bill had the wrong price for the goan coconut curry, the manager said that the real price was the price in the computer, and that the menu price was a misprint. I didn't bother fighting for it, and just subtracted the price difference from the tip. Weird experience overall."}
{"text":"Girls' Xmas dinner.  On a weeknight, the tiny restaurant was ~1/2 full.  A good number of patrons were coming in to pick up take-out.  

We had the veggie samosas, the butter chicken, channa, the biryani rice and naan bread.  The food was great and not greasy.  It was impossible to keep getting more helpings. Everything was great except for samosas, which were a bit dried out and lacked flavour. But forgiveable as the rest of the meal was great.

Service was a bit slow at times but when we mentioned we were on a schedule, they were happy to move more quickly. 

Dinner for 2ppl  (just food... only water for beverages) was ~$38.00 (after tax, before tip).

We are definitely returning-- fantastic find!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants I've ever been to.

I know butter chicken is such a 'basic' thing to order at Indian restaurants but trust me, it's incredible here. Get the garlic naan and mango lassi too and you'll be coming to Savera every week.

The service is wonderful - the people are so courteous and always remember your face (especially if you start coming here every week). 

I actually considered naming my first child Savera after discovering this place. True story."}
{"text":"There is nothing like some good Indian food when you feel terrible. For one thing, you can't miss the bold flavours. We were looking for a new place to go/call and Yelp came through. Based on the reviews, we ordered delivery. They were quite prompt. The fact that the restaurant is just down the street helped I'm sure.

Of course, it's all about the food and Savera definitely delivered. Sorry, had to be done. We got the samosas, butter chicken an lamb rogan josh. They were great. The naan and rice were great too. The prices are reasonable for good sized portions. 

In short, we will absolutely go back. Add my voice to those praising this restaurant. If you get near, or can get near, to St. Clair West, you will not go wrong here. 

Yet another reason to love this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Visiting from Austin Texas. I had the Daal Makhavi. So amazing. This exceeded all expectations. Put a dial touch on the day especially with the garlic naan."}
{"text":"I am very happy with the excellent customer service by staff during our visit for dinner. We ordered the shrimp biryani, lamb tikka masala and garlic naan. All were very delicious!

This is really one of the best Indian restaurants out there. I will definitey recommend this and will visit more often."}
{"text":"Went again a few weeks ago, had the shrimp pakora for an appetizer and it was AMAZING! So fresh! Love the vindaloo and aloo ghobi. Nota big fan of the butter chicken, a little too tomatoie for my taste. And the service there is always top notch."}
{"text":"The hidden gem at Savera is the tandoor meat - most notably the fish.  I hesitate to call it Indian barbecue but that's why it reminds me of.  It is really very good, the best I've had anywhere.  Their curries are unique in the sense that they're not as saucy as you get elsewhere but they're very tasty.  At first I was disappointed to see a realitvely un-sauced masala but it was very very good and in the end I didn't miss the sauce at all.  My wife and I weren't nuts about the palak paneer as Savera's version is a purée versus our preference where the spinach is well-cooked but not pure mush.  Savera is a bit expensive but the food here is reliable and the service is attentive in a low-key way."}
{"text":"First of all I can't believe it's taken me so long to finally try Savera, especially since it is literally a five minute walk from where I live.  So to make up for it I've been there twice in a two week period and hope to visit again soon.  

Most other cuisines can be eaten casually but for me, with Indian food, I like to appreciate each bite - making a nice basmati island and surrounding it with a little helping from each dish and following it up with the naan sweep.  And repeat.  It's even better when the dishware is pretty.  Come to think of it this is probably why I don't really enjoy Indian buffet. 

Things I enjoyed at Savera:
 - the perfectly crisp and fresh naan.  The plain is fabulous and the garlic and cheese flavours can stand alone they are so tasty.
- the fluffy basmati.  It seems silly to comment on something as fundamental as the rice but it was so good!
- the fact that you can customize the heat! Medium is just right for me.

On the first visit we tried the staples of veggie pakora, butter chicken, mattar paneer and lamb saag.  All good!  Second visit was with four instead of two adults so we were able to add chicken pakoras (skip it, they are just chicken fingers), eggplant dish (very good, sorry name escapes me), and chicken tikka (not my thing but others enjoyed it).  I have still to try the sizzling plate tandoori since my powers of persuasion seemed to be at an all time low during that second visit.

I feel that the prices are reasonable for the experience.  Both times we ended up at around $25/person for food.   Service is good."}
{"text":"The staff are very attentive and nice! Great service! The food is amazing. The take out containers were filled and I can't wait to go back again! I got the chicken tikka masala, garlic ban, and some rice... Delicious"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Savera last night.

It was my first time in, and I met a friend there who is a regular customer.

We ordered a few dishes to share and I was pleasantly surprised.

The first thing that hit me was the smell. As soon as you walk in, you know that the food is going to be good! The place smells amazing!

We ordered?

Baingan Bharta (Roasted Eggplant) - This was the winner of the evening.
Whole Eggplant roasted in the tandoor and then sauteed with tomato, onion, garlic and spices. This was the real deal ... and at only $6.95, it was very reasonably priced. 5/5

Palak Panner (Spinach and Cheese) - My all time favourite, go-to dish in an Indian joint. It was quite good at Savera, but not better than the Baingan. It was tangy, flavourful and with the right amount of spice. 4/5

Malai Kofta - (Cottage Cheese fritters in a creamy sauce) I haven't had this dish in a long time, as I find it too heavy. While it was heavy (it was the dish that incurred the biggest take-out container), it was tasty, but I found the balls to be a little too chewy. 3/5

Naan - was nice, but a little too doughy overall. I like my naan like a good pizza dough ... chewy in some parts, and cracker-like crisp in others. The naan at Savera was a 3/5/

Basmati Rice - awesome ... cooked to perfection. 5/5

Service was attentive and prompt.
Food was served quickly.

I will definitely go back!"}
