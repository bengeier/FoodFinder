{"text":"We just picked it as we drive by.  Only had time for a quick lunch before a sales appointment.  Service was great, food was really good.  Not from this area but I would love to try dinner there.  High marks."}
{"text":"Really like it here. Love the chicken souvlaki. The calamari is a hit-or-miss because sometimes the squid is tough. This is a great casual place to go to for a good price. Service is hit or miss as well. Would recommend to anyone wanting a good tasty meal. They also do take out!"}
{"text":"Authentic gyros, food is fantastic and reasonable!!  Family type restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good food and always give you plenty to fill you up , sometimes meat can be a little bland , but other than that really good experiences"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night.  Had the calmar, half chicken and gyro pitas and the house white wine...all were amazing!  Maybe a bit too much sauce in the pita but no biggie.  Cost 65$ in total and we were beyond satisfied.  Friendly service too, highly recommended for a cheaper night out."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this place and it will be my last time. We came here with a group of friends on a weekend. The place was busy and we got a table after 10 min. The waiter then took our order and then, the waiting started. We had to wait 20 min to get ustensils and water. We then saw that other tables had free garlic bread and we asked the waiter for some and he told us there were no more. It was odd because the table next to us just got a fresh batch. We then asked another waiter for some bread and we got some RIGHT AWAY...we then waited another 40 minutes for the food to arrive and they got my friend's order wrong. The service is just that bad... I know it's the weekend and it's busy but so are other restaurants and you don't see them messing up like this.   As for the food, it was very ordinary. The calamari didn't come with ANY sauce at all and it was just so dry to eat that alone. The souvlaki was just ok. Nothing special. With all the other good restaurants in montreal, I definitely wouldn't come back here. The location isn't even convenient at all."}
{"text":"It's crazy to think anyone would go here and not try the chicken. It's cut up into strange pieces (not the 8 typical pieces we think of) but, My GOD it's good. I'm going on the record as saying the chicken is the BEST I've ever had. Tzatziki is excellent and so is the Donner. I tried everything on the menu and the only things I didn't like were the rice and spanakopita. Also the décor is typical tacky Greek, like most good Greek restaurants. Cheap and filling! Can't go out afterwards because of all the garlic."}
{"text":"This place is my family's go-to place for Greek food. Old school, no fuss, delicious cheap beer on tap, and friendly waitstaff.   The calamari are crispy, tender goodness, the sides are always great, even the greek Salad during the winter, and the meat is delicious.   I think they might have the best Gyro pita and Greek style grilled chicken in town.   The Gyro is a delicious mix of meat on a spit with tzatziki, and tomatoes and the bread is a fluffy concoction. The Chicken is juicy, tasty, and full of flavour that goes great with the tzatziki, which is amazing.  Highly recommend it if you are in the neighborhood and hungry for Greek food."}
{"text":"First time that I ordered, took 1 hour and 40 minutes. Obviously the food was cold and mushy. In a city with so many restaurants = competition the service should be much better. This one is scratched from my list."}
{"text":"My mom loves to eat Greek food so when we decided to take her out for dinner we decided on Greek. We wanted to try a place in Laval but it was closed so we drove to Montreal since I've heard good things about Nostos.  I have to seriously question the taste buds of my family and friends since they suggested it.   We get there and its a seat yourself place. That's fine. We find a table that seats 3.  Our waitress comes up and asks if we'd like a beverage. We all declined. We get the menu and decide on a calamari plate to split between the 3 of us.  The calamari was perfectly cooked but under seasoned. That is fine as well. I can add my own salt. Nothing wrong with that.  Mom orders - Gyro plate  Sister - Chicken Souvlaki plate Me - gyro souvlaki plate  My mom's plate was a bunch of meat, rice, salad, and fries. There was no tzatzaki served with the plate of meat, nor pita bread. This is unheard of. Name a greek place where you have to order pita and tzatzaki separate when ordering a gyro meat plate!  Fries were disgusting. Salad was okay.Mom thought the gyro meat had a weird taste to it.   Sister's plate. Chicken was bland and tzatzaki had freaking paparikia on it. Who does that?! You want a splash of color try adding a black kalamata olive or something.  My plate - the fries were disgusting. They should consider changing their oil a bit more often or lowering the heat of their fryer.  I agree with my mom, the gyro meat was off. There was a weird taste to it. I personally loved the salad but wish the portion was bigger. If I were to ever go back I would ask for no fries and double salad.  When our waitress came to ask if there was anything else she could get us I tried to order a souvlaki pita to go. The waitress tells me the kitchen is closed, at 8:58pm. Now here is my problem with this...  1. If the kitchen was closed why did you come ask me if there was something else I wanted? 2. If the kitchen is closing and you have customers don't you think you should notify them of the fact that you are closing so that they can order? 3. Who closes a kitchen before 8:58pm. She said \"Sorry the kitchen is closed already...\"  I wouldn't go back. Everyone seems to like the chicken so if someone were to bring me chicken from there they might change my mind but for now, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Met my brother and an old friend for a quick casual lunch there a couple of days ago.  We shared a Taramasalad, a Village Salad (large), and 1 chicken cut up in pieces bone and all and cooked on grill with great spicing.  Everything was fine, but this is not a gold standard. This is a nice casual lunch, even a nice place for a nice family dinner. Nothing gave me the WOW factor although the chicken is excellent, but then there are other dining options in Montreal with better chicken (Daoud, Panama, Shish Kebab). The salad was good, and the great was garlicky and plentiful. I don't know why they don't serve pita it would be more in line with dipping in the Tarama, but that is their way.  The service was prompt and pleasant, and the coffee and baklava both fairly good. If you are near Central Market in Montreal its worth a try."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite, affordably priced and super tasty Greek food in the city! The Gyro, Chicken and Tzatziki are so delicious. The house wine is affordable and wonderful too."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Nostos for a few years now but I was elated to experience their yummy food once again. The first thing I noticed walking in was that this place has been completely remodeled. I liked the menu and the murals. Very nice!  I went with their Souvlaki pita as I remembered it being awesome as well as a side tzatziki. The first thing I noticed was that both tzatziki and pita had a few pinches of paprika? I will admit it was a first for me and I regularly eat Greek food at a variety of Greek restos. The good news is that I love paprika and it was ok. :)  My major issue was the pita being on the slim side. That's a huge no-no for me. I'm used to eating pitas filled the the brim with delicious Greek ingredients and I felt I only got 2/3 of a pita but at full price! I also felt the pita didn't really stand out at all!! Usually when I finish my pita I always contemplate getting another but after this gaunt pita I couldn't care for another.  The tzatziki was good and the bread that came with it hit the spot.  The service was alright being neither great nor bad.  Price-tag it was fair but with the average undersized pita it left me wanting more. Perhaps one day I'll come back and give it another shot but with so many great options in this area... that might take awhile!"}
{"text":"Attention dans le parking en arrivant j'ai éraflée mon par choc avant, c'est pleins de trous. La salade grecque ne goûte rien la sauce est clairement à revoir. Le pita était bon la sauce et la grillade de poulet mais il pourrait le gonfler un peu plus. Je connais mieux comme restaurent grec."}
{"text":"Holy Amazeballs Chicken! I had always thought my favorite restaurant chicken was Barbuto in NYC, but this wins. Very different, but winner winner...  Also, by far the garlickiest (that's a word now) tzaziki I've ever had. I'm vampire-proof for a good week from that plate.  Everything else was good - really liked the gyro platter and greek salads as well. Yummy fries (like only Montreal can deliver - what's up with that?)  Well-priced, good service, etc."}
{"text":"Newly renovated, Nostos is the benchmark for grilled chicken. That's were the story ends. Other dishes need work. Gyro plate is served without bread. Our tsaziki was compromised of 50% fat and fries are under cooked soggy and greasy. Calamari served plain without any sauce. Fries should be blanched instead of cooking once. Salads lack dressing and flavour. Service is prompt and courteous. A family restaurant which is priced right that needs some menu refinement."}
{"text":"Food : the food is okay. Nothing that blew me away in terms of taste - but does deliver. I might be biased due to the fact that my boyfriend is Greek and I've had the chance to eat at other Greek restaurants.  I never review based on price, but a lot of people seem to take that into consideration. Yes it is inexpensive - but there are many others with the same prices but better food.   Service : very good service, nice wait staff.  Decor : very quaint. Cute greek touch without overdoing it.  NOTE : i would probably look into renting the place for larger groups.  Yes I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to come for a greek lunch. I would not choose it has a dinner place. It's a sit down fast food type restaurant. The chicken is always really dry, but the potatoes are really good. Service is on and off good and bad. depends who's working and what days you are there."}
{"text":"This restaurant located in front of Marché Central is one of the best for Greek food in the area.   The staff is really friendly and the service really fast and efficient.   I recommend pretty much everything on the menu. Especially the Pork souvlakis. The meat is always well cooked and tender. A bit too much sauce but obviously you can tell them to go easy with it. ;)  The ambiance is always great. Lots of families and children so maybe not the place for a romantic dinner. ;)"}
{"text":"Chicken pita soooo delicious. Calamari also good. Nostos salad not bad. Worth come again. I ordered too much per one. One pita and salad is totally enough for a girl."}
{"text":"I'm not very familiar with Greek cuisine, but overall I liked it. We ordered family style with Greek salad, yogurt dip, fries, and their bbq pork. The salad was very light, had a nice balance with the fatty Greek yogurt. The meat was flavorful, but as it started to cool, the meat started to harden. I like this place, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Fresh, Well priced, Delicious. First place I visit when I go to Mtl. Best Souvlaki and Chicken in Montreal, hands down."}
{"text":"This is our go to family style Greek restaurant. The food is excellent and reasonably priced. I loved - I mean love, the grilled chicken, freshly cooked before serving. All the sides are perfectly made for a great meal - Greek salad, rice, French fries. This place is always busy because of the great taste and value. Make sure to reserve or come early to be seated."}
{"text":"This is a good family run Greek restaurant.  They expanded a while back and have a decent size sitting capacity for those interested in eating there.  It's a casual family style place, not exactly the place I'd bring a date.  As some have said attitudes can be hot and cold at times, but hey what do you expect... it's their place and they'll run it the way they want.. the have the food to do the talking for them right.  What's good:   I personal go for the souvlaki plates, however the chicken does seem to be a popular dish.  What's not: No delivery : (  this place is just down the road from me, but if I want to eat here I either have to eat there, or go do take away.  Personally I'd much prefer to support local family run business like this over big chains any day."}
{"text":"The food is good and cheap.  Usually for around $12 you get a gyro, greek salad, rice and fries and it's very tasty."}
{"text":"Solid Greek fair. The meats are delicious and well grilled and their food is not drenched in oil as opposed to other Greek options. However, don't expect much variety... their menu is a little limited if you compare it with the competition but what they have on it is definitely well done. Special mention for the yummy fries.  The service is a gamble... sometimes friendly and sometimes not so much... Mind you, I have never had a bad experience to the point of not going back.  If you are in the area, it's a very good choice."}
{"text":"Best greek resto in Montreal! I definitely  would recommend their grilled chicken or their gyro pita. Also, the Greek salad is amazing. :) Sometimes there is a line up, but definitely worth the wait ! I always bring my friends here , and they never leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Always practical when you have kids and you want to take out. Kids love it as well. I'm just not too crazy about there salad. Maybe they should do a second choice salad with lettuce and a certain sauce like the restaurant Marathon. Apart from that the food is really good."}
