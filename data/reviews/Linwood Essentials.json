{"text":"I went here on a Wednesday night to get drinks with a friend and catch up, and it was exactly what we were looking for. The sign is discreet, and the bar is upstairs, but we found it fine. It was dimly lit with dark wooden tables and sleek chairs, and sound levels that made it great for conversation. 

I had \"the Carmichael\" and \"Riding Through a Live Minefield on a Bicycle Built for Two\" which were both boozy and fresh. They clearly had a ton of fun naming the drinks, and I enjoyed reading the menu. My friend really enjoyed a couple of custom cocktails, cooked up by the bartender (who also seemed to be serving). 

We didn't try the hotdogs, but I really enjoyed the drinks and casual atmosphere. Maybe when I go back I'll have enough cocktails that I'm tempted."}
{"text":"We came with a party of 7 on a Friday night for dinner. Some of the group had been before and recommended the food and bar menu. Quite an extensive and interesting cocktail menu which I unfortunately couldn't indulge as I was driving so it was all about the food...

It was a tapas style, share with one another style menu, which always leads to good table/food talk amongst the group.

For starters we had the Pork Crack, a homemade pork rind that while good, wasn't finished by the table. The Bomba's, little fried beef and potato balls in a spicy aioli were a big hit. As a big (and one of only two at the table) anchovy fan, I ordered the Anchovy and Roasted Veg Toast. Made with real (not canned) white anchovies and roasted pepperw and eggplant it was...Tres Bien!

The Crispy Eggplant Salad was popular enough to be ordered several times. Taking my own life in my hands, I was only able to grab a piece of the crispy eggplant before the masses devoured the salad. A definate do again (sans the masses). The only two who are into that kind of thing had the Brussels Sprouts with Poached Egg. They raved about it but I knew better. 

The Catalan Fried Chicken was incredible, crispy with ground almonds and a prune and brandy sauce. I hate to say it but I beats out the fried chicken at Electric Mud. The Smoked Whitefish with Fennel Slaw was a do again that actually came home in a doggy-bag. As a big fan of both duck and foie gras, The Duck and Foie Gras Risotto, served with little bits of maple bourbon popcorn was fabulous.  The only complaint I had about the Oxtail Stew was that the serving size seemed a little meager.

While small enough to have an intimate dinner with friends, this hipster haven holds its own as a place to spend an evening sampling their vast bar menu. A definite do again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with three of my girlfriends with the intention of catching up over cocktails. We found this place on a whim. Located near the country general on the upstairs of a plaza, you could hardly tell this was a bar from the outside because of the blacked out windows. 

When we walked in at 10:45pm the place was about 60% packed. The ambience and decor was a juxtaposition of modern and rustic. There were three leather booth, a large bar seating, and a long wooden table. I loved that the music wasn't too loud to the point were you couldn't have a conversation. Nothing was pretentious or underwhelming. 

The waitress was super nice and helpful when it came to the menu because we had no idea what to order. The list of cocktails spanned 3 pages. With quirkier than usual names like \"Riding Through a Live Minefield on a Bicycle Built for Two.\" I ended up getting The Traveller ($15) which was a smooth whiskey based cocktail with chocolate undertones. My friend'a drink The Last Goodbye ($15) was super fruity and delicious came with the cutest little love note attached to it! My other friend tried The Troublemaker ($14) it had snicker shaving and a whole egg it it. 

Overall, the amount of craftsmanship in each drink is stunning. I can definitely see this being a go to drinking spot on queen west."}
{"text":"Had a terrific happy hour experience here on our visit to Toronto.  Fantastic drinks -- creative and delicious cocktails with a bartender who was attentive and really knowledgable.  The free popcorn was an added bonus. I would highly recommend this place!!  I only wish we lived locally so I could go here regularly!"}
{"text":"Great SPOT, great presentation and superb cocktails.
They run an happy hour to 7.00 pm that make it a bloody good deal. New buzz in the neightbourhood."}
{"text":"Cocktails are good with an extensive menu. Food not so great.

Ordered charred tempura vegetables $9 that just tasted of burnt fried stuff. Served as a big clump. I would have thought the batter would have been light and that you could still taste the vegetables. I was mistaken. I should have paid more attention to the word charred. 

Ordered the short rib sandwich $13. The filling was nice with tender beef and flavoursome source but it came in a burnt dry bun that added a burnt taste to it all and had a pointless thinly sliced skin on Apple as a side decoration.  

Would come again for pre night drinks or a chat and drinks but wouldn't bother with the food.

EDIT: I got the Rib sandwich on the house as it took a while although I didn't complain or mention anything. The barman just took it upon himself to say \"my bad & it's on me\""}
{"text":"Went here with some new friends for the first time after reading reviews and loved it! This little unassuming spot on Queen Street, was a treat to discover. Don't be mistaken by it's non-flashy minimalistic decor. The fact that there is little to distract allows you to focus on the quality of the rest.

Service: Our server Alex was amazing. He knew the menu and was able answer all our questions. He made great recommendations and took time to understand our preferences. We had people in the group with allergies and he made food recommendations accordingly. Best part was that he was genuine and loved working there, and he made as feel like regulars.

Ambience: We got there pretty early, and there was plenty of place to sit. We grabbed a spot with a view of the bar. The music volume was just right and we were able to have a good conversation. They were playing a fantastic indie music playlist. The atmosphere was relaxing and casual. The whole night we were fascinated by the owner at the bar mixing drinks with passion. It was so laid back, with people having a good time, no pretension and lots of energy. Even as the place started filling up, the place had a charming old-fashioned relaxed vibe.

Food and Drinks: The drinks were all phenomenal. And the food was all delicious. We tried several of the drinks on the cocktail menu, and also got custom drinks from the bar. All were made to perfection. We tried Mister Horse, The Drink I Made For Robin That One Time, The Last Goodby, and several others. The food came out in shareable tapas style. We tried the Bomba, creamy Chicken Croquettes, crispy Eggplant Salad, mouthwatering Short Rib Sandwich and decadent Foie Gras risotto. The only item we didn't enjoy as much was the Sweet Potato Three Ways. It was an overload of Sweet Potato. 

Although, it was expensive for the drinks. We still loved everything we tried, and we will definitely be coming back soon! Even if just to watch the bartenders practise the art of mixing a perfect libation."}
{"text":"The cocktails here are gorgeous. Their cocktail menu is  very extensive and quite fun to read.
I would recommend that you sit at the bar and watch the bartender craft his cocktails. You will see that a lot of love goes into every drink.

Don't be shy to ask the bartender what his recommendations are. The staff  are super friendly and very knowledable.

I think that if they improved their playlist, this could be a bar where you can hangut all night.

Looking forward to going back to try more yummy cocktails."}
{"text":"One of my favorite speakeasies in my hood. Definitely artists behind the bar. Recommended cocktails: The Righteous One, The Arcadian - but definitely let the bartender know what you're in the mood for and they'll whip you up something great. I had this incredible sour made for me once. Recommended bites: Fois Gras Risotto, Beet Squid Gnocchi. Small place, great vibe, date appropriate, sit at the bar for a good time."}
{"text":"This is an excellent choice for cocktails in Toronto. I loved the drinks here. A selection of the drink menu comes with cute presentations, but they definitely focus on the quality of the drinks over a spectacular presentation, which I appreciated. There is also a huge list of classic cocktails to choose from. 

Drinks:
Once Upon a Time in America, made with Bulleit Bourbon & Rye, was boozy and a great drink for Old Fashioned lovers. 
The Moonrunner, made with Dillon's White Rye and Buffalo Trace Bourbon, was my favorite drink of the night. It was sweet, but not too sweet, and sour. I wanted to stick with this drink, but FOMO led me to try other drinks.
What We Do In The Darkness, made with Woodford Reserve, was more boozy and bolder but also very good. A great whisky option if you want a stronger drink. 
The Last Goodbye, made with Bombay Sapphire Gin, was very light and refreshing. 

There was free popcorn that served as a good snack while enjoying the cocktails.

The service was slow at times due to only one bartender and one waiter working at 8 pm on a Saturday night. They were doing their best but were understaffed as more patrons continued to arrive. 

The atmosphere is basic, no frills.  It's all about the cocktails."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a few drinks before a dinner reservation nearby. The cocktails were so delicious! Mine had fruit loops milk in it. Fruit loops milk. My friend requested a cocktail that was citrus flavoured and spicy and it was all that and more. I am definitely returning for another visit!"}
{"text":"Solid experience that met expectations.  

I liked the space - it had an ambiance but was, at the same time, almost \"hole in the wall\" feeling.  We had a reservation (they take reservations via text message quite easily) and they placed us at a big booth, but due to bad backs in the group, we asked to move to the tables.  Well, that turned out to not work so well, so we actually moved back to the booth - all done with ease and smiles from serving staff, no questions asked.  

Menu can really please all palates (and if you don't find something you'll like, they'll make something up for you).  Big marks for presentation; creative, cute, picture-worthy.  The Magical Elixir was outstanding, just really delicious and well balanced.  Bartenders know what they are doing here, and it shows.

Our waitress, however, was (let's hope) clearly new -- she couldn't answer a lot of our questions, and one of the people in my party gave his credit card slyly to her earlier in the evening to make sure he was the one that picked up the tab, but when I tried the same move later, she actually accepted my card!  in that situation it should be first manipulate, first serve -- so then he rushed over and tried to remedy the issue going on.

I'd definitely be back, a really fun spot.  We didn't eat any hot dogs, so I can't comment on he food!"}
{"text":"YouTube celebrity has been \"Jake\" immigrates from the 905 to open this Prohibition era-themed bar.

Perched atop a convenience store in the Queen West hood, Linwood Essentials concocts some of the best cocktails in this city without the hipster attitude the area has become known for.

Food menu is in transition with a new menu to come in the near future. Maybe. If the owner feels like it. For now, they'll whip you up a hot dog if you're drunk enough.

But you're coming here for the drinks. Creative. Thoughtful. Tasty. It's really hard to walk out the door after just one drink. Or two or five. They're just that good."}
{"text":"What a great gem to get your night started, or spend the whole evening.  Rolled in here around midnight on a Saturday and the place was busy, but not packed.  We were able to grab a few seats at the bar, which ends up being a great spot as you can see the bartender do his work.

The names on the menu are hilarious and the drinks are extremely brilliant.  You can tell they spent a lot of time see what works and doesn't.  If you're a rye/bourbon/whiskey/scotch fan and like your drinks a little hard like me, go with \"The Arcadian\" or \"The Righteous One\".  Both keep the bite while adding subtle sweet flavours like maple syrup.   The \"Lion in a Coma\" an interesting concoction and a bartender favourite.  It combines thick IPA foam on the top, making it mealy, and a spicy note from jalapeno.  My friends tried a couple of others and we concluded that this is definitely a big step above your typical restaurant cocktail list.  They have a bunch of craft beers too, but why bother.

Service was top notch.  The bartender was extremely courteous and personable, making recommendations along the way.  The level of detail that goes along with these drinks really impressed me.  I have never been a big fan of places like barchef, but am already excited to bring my friends back here."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident... We were walking east on Queen Street from dinner, and we were looking for a place to have drinks. So as we were walking I checked out what bars came up on yelp and this one came up with 4.5 stars so we thought this would be a good choice. It was early so the place was empty, but boy did it fill up later on in the night! The drinks were awesome! Great cocktail bar! Such care was put into every drink! The waitress was awesome, I'm always overwhelmed by such large drink menus, so I always ask them what they recommend (I like really sweet and not to alcohol tasting) and she picked the perfect drink! My friend asked for a nice boozy sipper, and once again, she was bang on! The food menu was extremely small, like hot dogs or something, so luckily we had eaten already, but later we noticed the popcorn machine in the back. You just have to grab your own bowl and take it yourself. And it's good popcorn! Nice and salty and buttery! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails, amazing service.  If you're on Queen you have to stop in.  100's of beer, crafts and imports but the cocktails is where the Linwood shines."}
{"text":"From the moment we entered the well designed cocktail bar we knew this was going to be a perfect spot. The owner is a talented mixologist and the entire drinks menu is created by him. I had the Righteous One,  based on a fantastic house made brown butter infused bourbon.  Sit at the bar to watch the drinks being made, there is a real artistry in the making. It was interesting as well to discuss the various cocktails and infusions. But you don't have to pick from the list of creations ... Just let him know what you like and he'll work with that. All in all a great and unique bar."}
{"text":"So creative. Casual, yet classy. Great vibe. Fantastic way to round out a Friday night."}
{"text":"Great vibe and drink selection. I really like that they offer more familiar drinks at a cheaper price. They even made up a mocktail for my sis who was the DD."}
{"text":"I just got inspired.

I loved the concept, the passion I saw, the speed and accuracy for fixing such well thought drinks, and the taste: perfectly balanced and with \"wedding presentation\". 

The master mixologist decorates your drink with some funny, cute notes. The names and description of the drinks were poetic, the menu made me think that my beloved Oscar Wilde would've attended this joint.

The skills of JAke, the bartender, are unusual. They come from a truthful passion. I was REALLY impressed, and I felted lucky to had the honor of drinking 2 of his deep thoughtful creations...

If you consider yourself a drinking \"diva\". I challenge you, stop the shots and come here to taste art."}
{"text":"Linwood is legit. The bartenders were friendly, the hot dogs were delicious, the vibe was awesome and most importantly the cocktails were incredible."}
{"text":"I am kind of more than a little bit in love with this place. It has a speakeasy vibe - bartenders in suspenders and dress shirts with rolled up sleeves galore. It's on queen west west - off the regular strip which is probably why it's way less pretentious and more accessible than a lot of other bars of this caliber. 

The beauty of this place is that you can order the fancy cocktails - signature drinks created with imagination, whimsy and interesting ingredients. Stand outs were the love elixer - served in a medicine bottle. I also had a cocktail served in a hat and one that was delivered on the back of a tonka truck. The presentation is always surprising and fun. If that's not for you and all you want is a finely crafted regular cocktail - they have those too. The shocking thing is the price of the normal drinks. Completely reasonable and I would say on the more accessible side for downtown Toronto in an actual cocktail bar. 

One of my favourite places for a drink in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday and it was the perfect spot. The cocktail menu is overwhelming, but the waiter and bartender were very helpful in making recommendations based on your style or preference. The bar itself is small but still spacious and comfortable with big comfy booths and chairs and barstools, and dim overhead lights that keep the energy low key and relaxed.

Every drink was special, arriving with its own little story or customization. One came in a plastic hat, another in a toy truck, one in a tiki mug, one in a paper coffee cup. I had 3 drinks - pricey at around 15 each but very much worth it for the good service, ambiance and uniqueness that was included. 

I am hesitant to refer others here as it feels like an undiscovered gem and I don't want it to become too popular, bug honestly it was a great place and I would like to go back again."}
{"text":"Linwood Essentials got me when I had had some hard times after splittiing up with my ex girlfriend. This place helped my overcome my loneliness, because of the great stuff, nice and cozy interior design and it's far away from my ex girlfriend's place. Of course, I'd been there not on my own, with a friend of mine, but for a lonely person it's quite ok to go there too and drink a couple of shots or cocktails. 
Thank you guys for support."}
{"text":"Nice Bar with a very chill vibe. Would recommend to anyone looking for a proper drink. Music selection was a little weak."}
{"text":"We were bar-hopping, looking for the best Old Fashioned in the city and they delivered on all counts: craftmanship, taste, look and presentation. If you think you know cocktail and want to try one of the very best spots in Toronto you owe it to yourself to try Linwood Essentials."}
{"text":"They have the craziest names for cocktails. I had \"Riding through a live minefield on a bike build for two\" cocktail and it was amazing (spicy and sour). Dont be scared away by the names, they can be surprisingly good. 
The service was amazing, our waitress went through the menu for us and was knowledgeable when it comes to the drinks. They have wide selection of beers as well, you wont be disappointed (beers from Europe, Asia etc). 
Great place to hangout with a group of friends and or date. 
Price $$, avaerage price for cocktails."}
{"text":"really cool cocktails and great beer selection. i was impressed with the amount of stouts and porters available. the servers were very knowledgeable and cool. i liked the decor and the drink presentations were very clever.

my only complaint was the price. i know the bar is appealing to a trendier crowd, but $15 cocktails is a bit excessive. also, some of the beers were overpriced, especially since they came from a bottle or can."}
{"text":"We came for drinks last night and had a really great time. As die hard Simpsons fans who could resist drinking A Single Plum, Floating in Perfume, Served in a Man's Hat? 

I won't give too many details about the cocktails because it's part of the experience, and that's what I loved about this place, they deliver an experience.

They have a comprehensive cocktail list without the attitude. They have a Speakeasy theme, without being trite or try-hard. Above all the service was excellent, drinks strong and tasty. The result? A fantastic evening and a massive headache this morning. 

We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"You have to come to Linwood for the experience. Their passion for cocktail is seen. The presentation is outstanding and the cocktails are well balanced! One of the best I had in the city.

The bartender was so friendly and watching him make cocktails was mesmerizing!   

I got the Dr. V's Magical Quick Fixer Elixer! I would have litres of it if I could! I will be coming back for more for sure! I absolutely fell in love!"}
{"text":"Classy, friendly bar where you go with people you already know!  Patrons were in large groups OR with 1 other person, everyone was seated.  I didn't witness any 'single' scene here.  

There was comfortable seating in the front, nice large booths for big groups, & then padded stools at the bar.

Just like the atmosphere, bartenders were friendly and unpretentious, as were the patrons.  Bartenders will also offer to \"free style\" a drink for you if you're not feeling anything on the menu.

Cocktails had inventive names and were ~$14.  They also divided their drinks by categories like \"Fruity\", \"Crisp\", & other helpful adjectives.  In addition, there was an extensive list of beers, but I came for a cocktail, so I didn't really look at what kinds.

The next time I'm in the Trinity Bellwoods area, I would happily go back...especially during their happy hour!"}
{"text":"We rolled in on a saturday night and were advised not to sit on top of anyone :) The cocktail menu has a lot of choices with interesting nomenclature. The presentations on some of the cocktails is also fun. My wife had \"The Last Goodbye\" (Rosehip infused Bombay Sapphire East Gin, Lillet Blanc, pineapple, lemon, grenadine, fig preserves). It had very strong flavors but a tad on the sweeter end due to fig preserves. It comes with a letter attached to it. I chose the \"Lion in a Coma\" (Jalapeno infused Havana Club Anejo Blanco Rum, Disaronno Amaretto, mango, lime, IPA foam). This had a nice kick to it from the jalapeno but combined with the IPA foam it was very well balanced. They also tend to fill up the cocktail glass right upto its rim :)

They also serve tapas style small plates. We had the beet gnocchi with saffron sofrito and grilled squid. What an interesting mix of flavors! This grew on us with every subsequent bite. We love mushrooms and the mushroom toast was just what the doctor ordered to comfort us. All the food plates are shareable. 

The service was very friendly and the space had a nice laid back vibe overall. We will definitely return with friends and try out some of the other options on their cocktail/food menu."}
{"text":"I feel bad writing this because I wanted to hang out here so badly, but when we went in on a Saturday night, the place stunk of stale grease.  Either the kitchen fan was broken or they have no ventilation....we couldn't stay to have a drink - it was hard to breathe."}
{"text":"My drinking buddy introduced me to this hip, dim lit speakeasy bar last Sunday and I'm totally in love! Hidden on the second floor near Queen/Shaw, Linwood Essentials is the perfect place for delicious cocktails with an unexpected surprise/twist! I think it is essential to try them all lol.

'Tree' reasons to go!
1. The cocktails are seriously GOOD... and strong! I ordered 3 for myself and I enjoyed every one of them! There is something for everyone, whether you like it SWEET, SOUR, or BOLD with an attitude!
2. The mixologist who came up with these drinks is a genius. The unusual cocktail names and the unique presentation caught my attention. I see true passion behind each concoction.
3. Yes to complimentary buttery popcorn - go help yourself at the back of the restaurant :) They also serve a redneck hot dog and crab dip on the menu... not bad actually!

Spoiler alert

.
.

1. The Last Goodbye had a cute love note :)
2. Artisanal Middle Finger had a real pair of cute black glasses!
3. Dr. V's Magical Quick Fixer Elixir came in a medicine bottle, kept it as souvenir :D!
4. There is one that came in a truck... but I didn't order. Next time!

Check them out when you're in the neighbourhood! Plus, there are special deals on Sundays and Mondays. Prices are reasonable. Our server was our mixologist... thank you for your hospitality :) For those who don't drink... you can order soda for 'tree fiddy' lmao. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Can't speak to the food, but as drinks and ambiance go, this place is top notch. A bit of a rarity, our bartender,  Jake, was equally knowledgeable and passionate about cocktails AND beer.  And oh...the beer: Nøgne Ø, Mikkeller, Trappist Ales and a wide selection of local Ontario beer make Linwood a perfect stop if your party contains both beer nerds and cocktail snobs."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!! 
Food: 10/10
Music: 10/10
Drinks: 10/10
Service: 10/10
Atmosphere: 10/10 

Don't think I've ever given a full marks to a place yet, glad it was here."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks with friends. Cool vibe without being stuffy and stuck up. They have an extensive list of cocktails and beers. Their menu includes foods for sharing, though they're a bit small, one isn't enough for a group of even 3 I'd say. Food and drink are reasonably priced. 

The staff is very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend it for a night out with friends, or even a special someone (some small tables near the front)."}
{"text":"A hidden gem on Queen West! 

I had never heard of Linwood Essentials before but I am so glad I stumbled upon it one night with a girlfriend as we were looking for a spot to have some drinks on a Saturday night. From the moment I walked in I had a feeling it was going to be amazing. The cocktails were beyond fantastic, you can tell the bartenders put care and effort in crafting these beverages. 

Though I didn't get the chance to try any of the food, I did see a few dishes come out from the kitchen and it looked delicious. I am very eager to go back and experience the food!"}
{"text":"A very cute cocktail bar. A lot of thought went into a lot of the details. The bar has hidden shelves that look great. A lot of attention to detail in the cocktails. Loved the cute props. Our bartender was so friendly and nice. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Jake knows how to make a great cocktail! Whether it's one of his custom creations, or a classic drink, he makes it with finesse and serves with a smile. He's knowledgeable and willing to teach you a thing or two about his trade if you're interested. 

The rest of the staff are equally friendly and check in regularly without seeming pushy or like they're constantly hovering around you. 

The food is fun, creative, and tasty. I particularly enjoyed the fried chicken and the chocolate arancini. 

Music is loud enough without making you have to yell to be heard. 

I've also been here for a friend's party and it was a great choice. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place! Great service, friendly staff, very helpful with explaining and going through the menu. Limited food selection but honestly come here first then hit County General next-door for dinner. Can't lose with that combo. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"I really, really enjoyed Linwood Essentials. The place really mixes everything I like in a bar: delicious cocktails, good music, a not-too-pretentious attitude, and a casual, yet intimate atmosphere. You can make reservations on Yelp, but it ended up being unnecessary, as there were quite a few tables free. That isn't to say it wasn't busy, because it definitely was, but it was cool to see that it wasn't terribly crowded.

We got a couple of the drinks, very creatively named, and presented as well:
- Riding Through a Live Minefield on a Bicycle Built for Two: Thai-chili infused Famous Grouse scotch, green apple, lemon, simple syrup, egg white, and orange bitters. BOMB. This mixed just about everything I like in a drink, with the addition of egg whites for richness. Very spicy and spirit-forward, and the sliced green apples were actually quite sweet and delicious, perfect in offsetting the spiciness.
- Moonrunner: Dillon's White Rye, Buffalo Trace bourbon, blood orange, tonka bean, lemon, and Memphis BBQ bitters. This was pretty great, as it had a smokey, sweet taste from the BBQ bitters, and was presented on a large green Tonka toy truck. There's only one truck, so we felt quite special that we ended up with it for our order.
- One Wild Night in the East Village: Cazadores Reposado tequila, mace-infused Bols Genever, Linwood Amargo blend, PX Sherry, yellow chartreuse, yuzu, lime, Flanders Red Ale. Served in a large green porcelain tiki skull, the mix of flavors were much more sour, but still delicious. 
- Freak Gasoline Fight Accident: El Dorado 12 Rum, Young's Double Chocolate Stout, cold brew coffee, orange, egg white. Served in a styrofoam cup marked \"Derek\", this was a delicious, rich coffee-like tribute to Zoolander. Gotta love it.

The cocktails were pricier than at most places, but everything was very unique, well-mixed and we liked everything we had, so I'd say it's worth it. Service was excellent, and we got water refills quite quickly. Easily one of the more unique bar experiences I've had in a long time, even with the hotbed of cocktail bars in New York. Will definitely re-visit the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"The owner is quite a chemist. He makes a mean drink and is very knowledgeable and accommodating. The space could use some more atmosphere, I think in time it might acquire it like a fine brandy."}
