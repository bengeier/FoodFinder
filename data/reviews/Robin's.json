{"text":"I read the reviews, looked at the pictures and decided to visit.   On my quest for a better donut around Scarborough, I decided to try this place. My visit was about 8 pm and I brought the family.   The parking lot is large and had a lot of empty spaces. The dining room was the same.  One thing that stuck out was how clean this place is, even though, there are not a lot of garbage bins in sight. However. it was strategically placed.   The lady greeted us as we came in and was very patient as we were picking out our donuts. She told us that a half dozen donuts was $5 but we never got the price for a single donut and we couldn't find it on the menu either.   We chose 2 Boston Creams, 1 chocolate dip, 1 honey dip, a powered strawberry donut and a strawberry donut with a pattern on it, I don't remember what it was called. As we settled into the dining room to indulge in our donuts, we noticed that the donuts were larger than Tim Horton's and MUCH larger than Krispy Kreme. Sadly though, the donuts were stale and not as fresh as a Tim Horton's or Krispy Kreme donut. The kids wouldn't even eat half of one.   Location: 3/5 because there aren't a lot of them and we had to make a special trip.  Service 3/5, not overly friendly but informative.  Food 0/5, they really shouldn't be selling donuts if they aren't fresh.   Will we go again, probably not. There are better places with better products."}
{"text":"When I saw Robin's Donuts was opening up near me I was so excited! I used to come here on the west coast when I was a little kid. So obviously I had to relive my childhood and make a visit for a donut.  It's sitting area is a good size and the color definitely speaks to the branding (same color as the brand colors) The donuts are classic and delicious. I enjoyed the nostalgia brought on by just stepping into the building. I will be coming back when I need a donut fix."}
{"text":"So far, so good. Been waiting for this place to open. It is Nostalgic because you Wife is from Calgary and they are everywhere there.    Coffee is good and the donuts are nice and fluffy."}
{"text":"Good Bagels and friendly service"}
{"text":"The reincarnation of the coffee time that once stood here. The coffee is a-ok and definitively a large selection of pastries to accompany the beverage of choice.   The parking lot is plenty large with a drive through available if that is your style.   The sitting area is bright and spacious with plenty of free wifi and clean washrooms.   One area of concern is not many power outlets to charge up with. The staff here is plenty friendly but give them a few weeks to work out the kinks. Will be back when i am in the area and need a caffeine boost."}
