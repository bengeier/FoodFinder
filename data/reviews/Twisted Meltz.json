{"text":"I love this place!!! I always go here with my dad and I always get grilled cheese with a Pepsi and I always give the pickle to my mom and I just love this restaurant it is my favorite place to go I could eat here every day if if I could my one complaint is that there isn't a good amount of seating. My one compliment is that the service was great and my family loves it so I can say it's a place for the whole family to get a tasty, quality, and delicious meal.  I love melts"}
{"text":"Kent, Ohio is an undiscovered gem. The downtown has been revitalized with a mix of locally owned shops and small chains, and there is some great food to be eaten. I stumbled into Twisted Meltz, which is off the street and hidden in Acorn Alley, and tried the Joe Walsh, which is fried turkey, bacon, avocado, jalapeno and a couple kinds of cheeses. Think bread expertly toasted, and a great balance of flavors with a bit of a kick. The fried pickles are good, too, lightly fried and tasty. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So yummy.....so many choices....the tomato basil soup was so good....geez forgot the name of my sandwich.... Someone Hynde...maybe....staff was so sweet.....find yourself in Kent....dis be da place.....good luck, though, on selecting a sandwich....."}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat in Kent. We always hear Melt is good, but this place is better. More creative menu, better portions, and ability to customize sand which. My parents  always want to come here when they are in from North Carolina. This is my go to place overall when company is in town, everyone loves it."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. The sandwiches are fresh and BIG. Ice cream is good as well. Milkshakes are so good."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, let alone a bad one.  Unless I'm REALLY upset.  First this place is a knock-off of The Melt.  I used to live in Lakewood and I always used to go to The Melt.  I moved to Kent a year ago, so I decided to give Twisted Meltz a try.  I ordered the Arsenio Hall, and the meat had mold in it, little white furry spots on the meat.  It tasted sour, so that's when I looked and saw the mold.  Six months later I tried it one more time because I'm addicted to The Melt in Lakewood, so I thought I would try this to curve my craving.  I ordered the James Harrison this time.  I found a fucking hair that was 12 inches long.  I called the Twisted Meltz and the person that picked up the phone was rude as hell, and hung up on me.  This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Awesome!   I ordered three items and am very happy. The first was the Al Douglas grilled cheese with added scrambled eggs and bacon. The second item was the Ray Wise double w/o mayo or tomato. Last but not least I ordered a pint of cookie dough ice cream and had that pint arrived with a spoon I would have given this place five stars.  The sandwiches are fantastic and the ice cream is very tasty. The delivery was a 3rd party service; I was told 45/50 mins and the timing was spot on. The delivery girl went down to my hotel's front desk and had spoon delivered to me - so even the delivery service was great.  I am very happy with the customer service, the quality of the food products, and the fact that it was delivered to my hotel - The Kent University Hotel - was icing on the cake.  I recommend this place - I believe you won't be disappointed! My first time in Kent and I found a local favorite - if I travel back to Kent I will come back for more!  Rock on."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and quick with a recommendation.   The burger they use is not very high quality and really over cooked.  But the twister sauce and bread made the sandwich.  I picked up a big as$ pretzel for a friend and that is what saved this from being a three star review.  It was very good!  A must get if your going to Twisted Melts.   The cheese sauce and mustard are meh from a can I'm sure but the pretzel was hot, fresh, the right texture and full of delicious coarse salt on the top.  Easily the pretzel could feed 4-5 as an app and eaten with out a sauce."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend was living in Kent and I was in Salem, MA, I ordered a sandwich from Meltz to be delivered to his home.  When you can't be there for someone in person, a giant toasty sandwich oozing cheese and enticing aromas is the next best thing."}
{"text":"A burger where the \"bun\" is 2 grilled cheese sandwiches? Why yes, I think I will!  I had the \"Don King\" w/ fries and had to bring half of it home.  Would go again!"}
{"text":"Holy crap this stuff is good!!!  I ordered the Don King (single) and WOW absolutely no regrets! Will admit i didnt think the actually \"bread\" of the sandwiches were each grilled cheese sandwiches hahaha, pretty delicious anyway though!   Freaking deelish but be prepared for the calorie intake!"}
{"text":"We've ordered (delivery) a few times now and am super happy. I always try to get something different, but my kids swear by the Al Douglas (7yr old super picky!) and the Lou Holtz. On top of that they have the best tomato soup I think I've ever had from a restaurant.  My only real complaint is that they have no on-line order option but that's just me being spoiled."}
{"text":"Yum! Best sandwich place in Kent by far. Huge sandwiches. Great variety. Delicious sides. Crave worthy."}
{"text":"Short review: Great food, decent price, good atmosphere, unique.   We came in late on a Sunday night (around 8:15 PM). The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. The twist on grilled cheese was more than satisfying. I had what was a grilled cheese take on a \"philly\" called an \"Arsenio Hall\" and it was the best philly I have ever had. I had it on sour dough bread without mushrooms and every bite of the sandwich was delicious. The crispy toast and completely melted cheese were better than I would have expected.   She had the \"Nick Saban with bacon\" on sour dough and her sandwich was comparably good. The spicy aioli was particularly well matched for her 'wich but I think we both prefered the Arsenio Hall. Again the bread and cheese were perfectly cooked and really high quality.   Also, they have a decent beer selection (all bottles or cans to draft). The atmosphere was also nice with lots on the walls."}
{"text":"My husband and I were driving from Warren to Kent and wanted to have a good lunch along the way.  We were not disappointed!  I ordered the James Harrison and my husband had the Arsenio Hall.  The James Harrison was ridiculously amazing.  The caramelized onions were cooked perfectly.  With the BBQ sauce, mayo, cheese and onion ring, I thought it might be too much but it was delicious.  My husband said his Arsenio Hall was also great.  They even had ice cream, but we were too full to try it out.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to come here more often since I live in Texas.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My son goes to Kent State. He took me to this local hangout for a quick meal. The food was absolutely delicious! I ordered the James Harrison and it did not disappoint! The fries were crispy and hot. I was surprised by how quick the food came out and delivered to the table. Parking was not an issue for us. The restaurant is a hidden gem on a side alley. I'm not sure I would have even noticed it not being a local resident. But I know where it is now and will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese you'll ever eat. Fast,courteous service. Excellent local business!!!!!! If you can still eat afterwards their ice cream is delicious as well."}
{"text":"i love chingy dirango! It's really good. I like animals. Police coppers scare me. I just want a full review and free ice cream. It's really cold outside at the end of March. That's quite unusual. Remember that episode of Breaking Bad, \"Ozymandius\"? What a great episode. Almost as great as Twisted Meltz. Thanks."}
{"text":"Just off Acorn Alley.  I love the Chrissie Hynde.  Parking is easier off Main Street in Kent.  Great owners!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times, it's always good but fairly greasy."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, I got one of their signature sandwich - DRI ARCHER, it was just perfect. Nice favors and I would highly recommend the battered fries."}
{"text":"Ok, just had the Mark Mothersbaugh sandwhich is REALLY great!!!  Spicy but not too spicy, great taste and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love Twisted Meltz. Ordered several items from here for delivery to my office. Delivery does take about an hour but the food is great, hot and not soggy like other restaurant deliveries in town.   The tomato soup is kickin just enough to give it an edge and great for dipping my basic grilled cheese in. The burgers on the sandwiches are well done and crispy - not salty but have good seasoning. Fries are extra crispy just how I like them and not soggy when they arrive. Overall, I'll continue to order from here."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The sandwich are huge with awesome ingredients, fries are big and crispy, and you have to have the pretzel bites. The service is also very safe and courteous with a nice big dinning area."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped by for lunch. It was our first time here and we were very pleased. I ordered the Mark Mothersbaugh and it was delicious! A very nice combination of spicy from the siriacha and I little sweet from the pineapple. The service was fast and friendly. We'll definitely be stopping back!"}
{"text":"Really nice sandwiches and they are quite filling. Affordable and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"What a ripoff. Melt isn't the only gourmet grilled cheese place in the world, but it's a Northeast Ohio staple, and a nationally recognized leader in great, original takes on comfort food. Twisted Meltz knocks off their menu, method for naming their sandwiches, and even their name. What they don't pull off is the real Melt's great personality, decor, service, and vegetarian options. Atmosphere is sorely lacking, service is unfriendly,  no beer, and no vegan options. Not a surprise that a company willing to be so unoriginal is also so clueless."}
{"text":"Their food is addicting. Really creative menu and fun atmosphere. Wish they had more bread options though."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place in Kent! I've eaten here several times and tried something new each time, and I've been impressed each time. Food is always hot and tastes fresh. Probably would say the best sandwich I've had so far was the BBQ burger one, James Harrison. The place is family owned and are friendly every time I go in there.  I wish they could expand to have more seating! Only saying good for groups no due to size inside."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great food at great prices. I recommend the Steve Harvey (the chicken was awesome) and pierogis!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food !! When you get a delivery your food is hot !! Always made fresh !!! The staff is very friendly !!!"}
{"text":"Nick Saban sandwich with fries. Tasted like a champion, looked like a champion, was/is a champion. Roll Tide."}
{"text":"Great sandwich. Got the James Harrison.  Fries are crispy. Kid's chicken tenders were tasty.  Lots of choices. Plus build your own."}
{"text":"Amazing Burgers and Sandwiches. Fabulous Appetizers.  Just can't go wrong eating here :)"}
{"text":"What a great new add on to all the new things popping up in Kent (well this place was new to me when I visited)!  I came here with my family not knowing what to expect but we had heard good things. This establishment is small and not good for big groups but if you order to go and sit somewhere outside that would work perfectly. We were lucky enough to get a table inside but it's a tight fit.   The sandwiches were awesome! They were everything we were expecting. I think it's pretty much a staple now in NEO to have a grilled cheese/sandwich place in every city. I can't wait to come back!  Note: If you check in on your yelp app you can get 15% off your first order :)"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of deliciously unhealthy sandwiches, you'll love Twisted Meltz. After trying the double James Harrison, I'm going to have a hard time finding a more flavorful and filling sandwich. Burgers, bacon, and onion rings complement each other unsurprisingly well. It's fairly heavy, so not something you'd want to order every day, but it makes for the perfect cheat meal.  The battered fries and fried pickles, although a bit soft because it was a takeout order, were still on par with the sandwiches, and both were reasonably priced. For the not-so-health-conscious, I'd definitely recommend Twisted Meltz for classic melt sandwiches with a creative twist."}
{"text":"After a nearby round of golf, my buddy and I wandered over for a hot sandwich and were not disappointed.  The gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches these guys are pumping out (more than two dozen to choose from) are really top notch, and the atmosphere is fun and the vibe chill.  We decided to order two different sandwiches and share (more to sample, right?!?!?).  We split a Michael Keaton and a Wayne Dawson.  The Michael Keaton (which came dressed with shaved ribeye, roasted peppers, horseradish chive cheddar cheese, mozzarella and ale mustard) was really excellent.  The tang from the horseradish sauce paired perfectly with the beef and the bread was grilled perfectly.  The Wayne Dawson (topped with BBQ pulled pork, grandmas coleslaw, muenster cheese, cheddar and sweet baby rays BBQ sauce) was good.  This was basically an overflowing BBQ sandwich grilled between Texas toast.  I also order their fries, which were crispy and delicious (not sure what they are doing to get that crunch...but keep it up!).  Counter service to order and then the sandwiches are brought to your table...inside seating or out.  You'll be glad you gave this place a try, especially for the price paid...a great value."}
{"text":"Yummmmm. Best grilled cheese in a while. Situated in the best place ever - Kent, Ohio. Grilled cheese is perfect and served on your choice of bread. I got the Michael Keaton with some fried pickles and my kids did build your own. My husband decided on the Wayne Dawson with some kick butt pork and all the fixings . This place is always busy and the prices are so reasonable compared to other grilled cheese places.... shall not be named. We also ordered some fries and some o rings and beer and desserts and it was the perfect Saturday evening in Kent."}
{"text":"Really good!!! I've been here several times. You just order at the register and pick up your food. 10/10 recommend the fried Pierogis! Come with caramelized onion, bacon and cheese- they are delicious. It's a small place but there's always somewhere to sit and it's a big place for college students because it's right by the campus."}
{"text":"I like this place, all of the sandwiches are named after different local celebrities and they are very good. Not a bad place to stop by when walking around downtown. Warning though, the city just put in meters everywhere which sucks, but whatever."}
{"text":"Love the menu names and the food! I come here for ice cream and their amazing sides. ."}
{"text":"I ate here twice in a weekend. Had the Arsenio Hall and the James Harrison. Both sandwiches were excellent. Service good. What you expect from a unique campus eatery. Friendly kids with some eclectic appearances. I will eat here any time I am near Kent."}
{"text":"Unique sandwiches! Taste and prices were reasonable but not low fat. Yes, we will be back."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Of course on the fatty side of life. If you are ready to just indulge then this is a must go place. They have quite a variety... No processed food. Juice and delicious."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot to eat. The sandwiches are plenty to choose from. We had the pierogis and the sweet potato fries and they were delicious! They have a small enclosed patio to eat in as well as their cafe the can open up to Acorn Alley. Definitely a spot to check out."}
{"text":"Favourite sandwich in town! They battered french fries are to die for, just so good!!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good - as long as you're not expecting anything gourmet fancy or healthy at all. The Steve Harvey is a fave. However, you should always eat there or pick up. They offer delivery, but it takes over an hour (happened twice - I live a mile away), and is cold by the time you get it."}
{"text":"Another neat place in Acorn Alley!  It is one of the fun places in downtown Kent. A must!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, & very friendly servers! I would highly recommend coming here to eat!!! There are some really cool choices of food on the wall!!! Everything here is yummy!!!"}
{"text":"It's similar to Melt but way better prices.  I don't remember what it was that I got but it had pulled pork and cole slaw on it and it was tasty.  It's tucked away off the street so it can be tough to find.  My in-laws and husband enjoyed their food.  There isn't table service though, hence the better prices.  Great selection and yummy sandwich combinations.  Staff was also very friendly!"}
{"text":"A great addition to downtown Kent! I like that the names of the sandwiches are all Kent State alumni. A lot of people think they are ripping off Melt, but I honestly think this place is better just from a service standpoint and the fact that it's Kent specific.   The food is really good. The portions are HUGE. I usually take half of my sandwich home and eat it later. There are a few vegetarian options, but I wish there were more.   My one complaint is that there isn't a lot of seating. Most of their seating is in the garage patio, which in the winter gets really cold. You also have to cut through the ice cream shop next door to get to it. From the outside, it looks like it is to-go only from the lack of tables.   Overall, if I'm really hungry and in downtown, my friends and I like to go here. I have to be in the area though. I wouldn't come out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since it opened. Very good, very consistent and workers are very friendly. If you want a great sandwich and fries and not pay a ton of money this is your place. My favorite is the Dri Archer and my wife's is the James Harrison. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches and portions don't disappoint! Can't wait to go back and try a different sandwich."}
{"text":"Just got turn on to this place, we have a melts by me and this place is much better, very small place, but there's place you can eat there, great food great food,"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, awesome food. Large portions. Been there a couple times, end up taking half of my sandwich home, where my son would eat it. Finally took him there, it's his new favorite place to go."}
{"text":"I was expecting a sit down sandwich shop.  Instead it's a walk up order counter, only has two tables inside but there are more available outside, and you have to get a key to use the outside public restrooms. But the sandwiches are FANTASTIC!  In my group we ordered Drew Carey, Josh Cribbs, Don King, and Dolph Ziggler.  And all of them got a \"Wow!\""}
{"text":"the Chrissy hynde is yummmmmy and I would definitely come back. this is my second time here and it is so good :)"}
{"text":"Surprising number of gluten free sandwich choices. The GF bread was better than most.  I'd recommend the Josh Cribbs although the spicy mayo wasn't too spicy.  Meal size was just right but there are plenty of add on's if you want to walk away totally full.  Practically right across the street from the Kent Stage, it's a great place for a sandwich before the concert."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome food! I love their Joe Walsh, and pretty much their entire menu.   My only complaint is that it is set up like a quick service restaurant but it generally takes them 20-25 minutes to get my food ready when it is not busy and I ordered 1 sandwich. I am puzzled how it can take this long to make a grilled cheese.   Overall, I come here many times a month  because the food is so good and just remember that I need to allow some extra time to get my food."}
{"text":"Great little joint in a college town with college prices! If you want overpriced grilled cheese with fancy names and a lot of tawdry decor...head to the burbs for that \"other\" place. This dine-in establishment had a nice beer list and an impressive menu that will most definitely bring us back the next time we are in Kent."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend, the sandwich was tasty but a bit underwhelming.    I had the Joe Walsh, which is fried turkey, hickory bacon, diced jalapeño peppers, diced tomato, avocado, habanero jack, white American & spicy mayo.  The mix of flavors was very tasty, but two little pieces of bacon, and hard to find turkey buried in the midst of large thick pieces of bread was not what I was hoping for.  The fries are very good, generous serving, not greasy.  The choc malt was tasty."}
{"text":"Loved the fact that you can build your own sandwich. I built a ham sandwich with Munster cheese, lettuce, mayo, tomatoes and the best part-a pretzel bun! I attached a photo! Very delicious spot. I also love the local NE Ohio named sandwiches."}
{"text":"Words can't describe how much I love this place. Whether it's one of their signature sandwiches or you create your own, you can't go wrong here. I usually get either the Chrissy Hynde or the Dick Goddard depending on my hunger level that day. They always make everything to order, and a ridiculously fast. They offer dine in, carry out, or delivery. Usually I carry out and by the time I hang up the phone, put my shoes on and drive over, it's done. I live close, but that's a huge feat. Staff is always friendly, I've met the owner a few times and she seems to really like her business. (They own the Ashby's ice cream place next door too!) Nice eating area, it's cool to sit outside and watch people in Acorn Alley while you enjoy your sandwich!"}
{"text":"I have yet to eat inside this restaurant, but I have ordered delivery from here and each time it has being delicious.  Writing this review has me reminiscing  on the deliciousness of this food which has made me hungry now and I will keep this review short.   Simple words try it!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and showed up to a closed store 20 minutes before they should have been. They didn't have my order and sent it out for delivery to someone else. Waited 15 minutes for my order to be remade and they didn't even give me my drink. Poor service to say the least."}
{"text":"Really good meltz. I like the Stevie wonder. The celebrity sandwich names are cool. Nothing amazing but good nonetheless"}
{"text":"Large menu selection. Ordered the dri archer and the corned beef with battered fries and fried pickles. Food was ok but not all that flavorful. Very blah, but when your hungry it gets the job done."}
{"text":"The prices were low but so was the service they did not seemed engaged.They were not friendly but also they were not mean.The place was dirty and unfashionable.I would only recommend this place to college students."}
{"text":"This place is delicious also offers the Belly app to earn points to earn free items which are always great. We first found this place just walking around during winter waiting for it to open, just looking at the ingredients made me salivate. We went for our first date and it was freaking delicious and we just keep coming back. Love their ice cream too best place everrrr!!!"}
{"text":"Such a fun cool place!!! You walk in and see a giant chalkboard full of Sandwiches named after famous Ohioans. So many choices and can change and more things if you want. So many fun fried sides to pick from and it's attached to a soda shop too so you can get ice cream after you eat your sandwich. I love this place!!! So glad to have this funky joint in kent right by campus in the heart of downtown. I will be back for sure!!!! I got the Drew Carey and sweet potato fries amazing!!!!  Cheap and fast. Just perfect :)"}
{"text":"This is a great sandwich place. Interesting combinations (I got the Joe Walsh, it was fantastic) and good ingredients. The sourdough bread is delicious. I like the fries too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So many choices, how to choose? My friend and I split 2 different combos, each with an angus beef patty. The beef was cooked to perfection, juicy and tender. The bread was toasted to the perfect bit of crunch. I was really in the mood to be waited on and was disappointed that we had to order at the counter but when they said that they would be serving us after we ordered I was relieved. They brought everything we needed to the table and it was lovely sitting outside in Acorn Alley. The employees were helpful and cheerful. I would go back!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place and it is truly a gem.  They have such interesting sandwiches all unique in names and ingredients but delicious. blueberry infused sausage, triple turkey cheese melt-   omg I'm drooling just thinking about it.  (kinda gross of me actually- should probably clean this up)  definitely recommend a visit, reasonable 5-10 dollar range meals and you get a lot for what you pay for its worth every penny."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches. It's like the Melt in Cleveland but much better priced. The sweet potato fries are amazing."}
{"text":"I've only ever gotten to go, so I can't speak for the atmosphere but the food is pretty good. Standard bar food, lots of sandwich combos. The fried Mac and cheese bites are delicious."}
{"text":"First time at this place, it had so many sandwich choices, I had trouble deciding which one to choose. I ended up choosing the Michael Keaton sandwich with fries, it was hot and very tasty! Homemade brownie was great! Service was fast and friendly! The girl working up front was really nice, she gets an A+ for customer service."}
{"text":"This place is a jewel of Kent. It is down one of those side streets that you have to walk to but it is worth it! It is very similar to the restaurant Melt but personally I like this place just as much and it's closer to home. It's for a college students that is definitely for sure. I had the sandwich that had the pierogis on them and oh my was it delicious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was not expensive but it tasted excellent! The service was great. The waiters were very helpful. I highly recommend this restaurant to others!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been the talk of the town recently, so I gave it a shot. I ordered the Michael Keaton -- roast beef, roasted red peppers, etc -- and it was delicious! Even the fries were really good, and I'm not much of a French fry person. The place was hopping when I arrived, so I waited for a little bit for my food, but the wait was worth it! It seems like the type of place that could get busy around typical meal times, so be mindful of that before coming. The popularity is well-earned, though! Next time, I'll have to save room for the ice cream parlor right next door. :)"}
{"text":"First time ordering from Twisted Meltz. My husband and I got the Michael Keaton and the Arsenio Hall both sandwiches way exceeded our expectations! The meat was high quality not all fatty both were very flavorful. We had them delivered to our house which was Super fast! We will definitely be ordering from there on a regular basis...what a great addition to downtown Kent."}
{"text":"I gotta give this one the 5 stars! We completely enjoyed ourselves here from the relaxed and classic interior, the conversational and friendly staff, reasonable pricing, the location itself was adorable in acorn alley, and the food was banging!!  Every item of food was piping hot straight from the back and very fast even though the place was packed. They obviously make every item to order. Even my pierogi itself inside my sandwich was smoking hot as if it was cooked separately as ordered as well. I think this helped with nothing being soggy either, which rarely happens with a fat stacked grilled cheese. The fries were seasoned and crispy (my fav), the sandwiches were fresh ingredients and inventive. There were so many suggestions on the board as well as ability to make your own. I want to go back and try the breakfast one.   Everyone liked theirs that I was with. I got the Dolph Ziggler which is caramelized onions, bacon, potato and cheese pierogi, cheddar cheese, and sour cream. It was super tasty but was lacking a bit of either sauce or flavor, not sure what.....I added my stepdads grilled pineapple to it and that helped!   Next time I want to try a milkshake, brownie sundae, and the big a** pretzel but we'd have to make extra room in our stomachs or hang out for a while because the sandwiches are filling! I'd like to sit in the inside outside feeling room as well, because that looked like a cool place.   I love a company that appreciates its return customers and gives incentives. They have the belly app and also a text coupon system I noticed as well. I can dig that, keeps cost low and college population coming back. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The Twisted Meltz is a unique restaurant that offers many melt specialty sandwiches. The food is quite good, simple, and in someways traditional, keeping to the American style of restaurant without going to crazy. My only complaint is that I don't care about the special names for the menu items. I think it can be annoying to have to read each one and try to remember what you want along with a friend. I wish it was kept simple with simple sandwich names."}
{"text":"Very cool place. My sandwhich was DELICIOUS!! A big selection, helpful staff, and fun atmosphere make this a place worth coming to. Settled in Acorn Alley, amongst other cool shops and bars, adds to the fun."}
{"text":"Had some sort of burger that had two grilled cheeses for the bun...and it was a greasy mess.  This isn't the reason for the 3 stars, because I love a messy grease ball to soak up the alcohol from the night before.  I had to make the decision to deduct 2 stars for the water they served.  It tasted like Flint Michigan poison  water and they didn't have bottled so wtf do I do.  Well I take off 2 stars that's what I do."}
{"text":"Great food, fun decor!"}
{"text":"I'm from Cleveland and live in Akron, so I wasn't sure if this place was gonna be like Melt or Lockview or neither, I'd say it's closer to neither and that's okay. Its not really a grilled cheese place at all, a lot of burgers, a good number of lunch meat sandwiches, and a few grilled cheeses. I wish they had more grilled cheese options, but maybe that's just because that's what I was expecting. Its a made to order setup rather than having servers. I got the Lou Holtz with a side of coleslaw (a lot of the sandwiches are named after famous Kent State alumni which I thought was cool), The sandwich was pretty good, but the coleslaw was just Grandmas coleslaw (a brand you can buy premade from like Giant Eagle, personally not a fan). Service was quick, and they had a good selection of beers and nice outside seating. This was perfect place to stop at when doing a bike ride from Akron to Kent and back. If still prefer a number 3 from lockview, but bad at all."}
{"text":"Delish! I tried the Tracy McCool sandwich and was glad I made that choice. Served on a pretzel bun which helped with the mess factor. The red peppers were a little over powering, but overall the sandwich was great and the flavors worked well together. A little messy, so grab some extra napkins!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, friendly staff- what a cute place!  We're doing college visits in Ohio and happened on this gem.  If you're near Kent I'd recommend stopping here!"}
{"text":"I really liked their grilled cheese and fries. The grilled cheese wasn't a big greasy mess like at some other grilled cheese restaurants. Also the fries were hot and fresh. Place was very small and very crowded though. I will still go back again!"}
{"text":"You have to stop in if you are visiting Kent.  Enjoyed the Michael Keaton with a side of the Pretzel cheese bites.  Serve was nice and quick.  Inside is small but they have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I have gotten delivery from here a couple times and in my opinion the food would have been fantastic if it was ordered in rather than delivered. I should have thought about what kind of food I was requesting (sandwiches aka bread with melted cheese tons of toppings) and the fact that no matter how good the delivery service is (which it was great and fast) there's no way the sandwiches weren't going to be a little mushy. So really it's my own fault the rest of the process, options and staff were great :)"}
{"text":"Good basic meal of sandwich and fries. The sandwiches are creative. You can also customize your own. Love the Kent State grad sandwich names."}
{"text":"Great sandwich eatery found not too far from Kent State's campus in a really urban/trendy outdoor mall. Sandwiches are named after famous people, and if it were based solely on that I would've had the Drew Carey. However, my taste buds won and I tried the Josh Kline (Reuben). Pretty decent size for a good price. Meat was great quality & overall a good sandwich. There's an ice cream shop attached that we didn't frequent, but the desserts looked super yummy. There's both indoor and outdoor seating, which is great when it's busy to help with the indoor noise level. The staff was super helpful and welcoming, even to us newbies holding up the line."}
{"text":"God's gift to this earth. It's tricky to find because it's back off the street in an alley way between buildings (don't worry. It's safe) but the search was totally worth it. My grilled cheese had fried mac and cheese, bacon, ranch, and two cheeses. I about died and went to heaven. Couldn't stop eating."}
{"text":"Amazing food, love this place. Best part of moving to Ohio is this place. Staff is always in great mood, very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"This my favorite place for sandwiches and dessert. Yes, their dessert especially their hot chocolate fudge sundae is amazing and is every chocolate lovers dream dessert. Sandwiches are equally good whether it be with meat or veggie. Highly recommend to visit this place"}
{"text":"Very cool little place to grab a large variety of melts and some good beer as well. Will make it a point to come back out. The yelp reviews didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Incredible, huge, delicious menu. And yummy bottled soda. My kiddos and I were blown away."}
{"text":"A recent move has put me in Stow, and as an ex Angelino I was concerned about getting great food... we are spoiled with new and delicious food in LA. Upon seeing reviews we tried Twisted Meltz and it DID NOT DISSAPPOINT!! I say good on you for opening a great hot sandwich shop that cares about making good tasting and reasonably priced lunch/dinner fodder. The loaded tots are awesome ,and as a beer lover ,their selections of craft beers are great. There are so many sandwich selections I HAVE TO go back! I recommend the Harrison, it was a safer first try sandwich and was excellent"}
{"text":"This isn't the \"other place\", it's Twisted Meltz and here's everything that is super cool about it... everything! The location is tucked away in a cool alley with artsy stores flanking it, so it's already looking cool before you enter. But, uh, upon entering, you're tasked with selecting a sandwich- so many choices! I've been here several times and always get the Chrissie Hyde- quite possibly the best sandwich I've ever had! It has roasted red pepper hummus, avocado, spinach, caramelized onions, mozzarella, feta, balsamic glaze & arugula pesto. The combination is incredible! My boyfriend gets the Dri Archer and it has panko chicken, hickory bacon, fried provolone wedges, cheddar, provolone and ranch dressing on a pretzel bun. It's also really good but I can't deviate from my go-to-sammie. Their fries are something from a dream! I couldn't even imagine fries being this good! Not like carnival fries, or fast food fries- there is something special about them and I just can't put my finger on it.   Sign up to get their texts with misc specials they run. Oh, you'll be back!"}
{"text":"Messed up my vegan order twice with non-vegan items. The \"help\" that worked there didn't seem all that knowledgeable regarding vegan items. And the only reason why I gave this place a try is because I had emailed them to ask about their vegan options. The email I received told me that I could order a few sandwhich a but without the cheese or sub with vegan cheese, which is what I tried. The bread I was given had egg apparently and they buttered my bread. They need to know more about what is in their food before claiming to offer vegan food."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, enjoyable casual patio (well, garage with an open door). They claim to offer delivery but its off and on, depends on who is working that night.   Wish they had more beverage options, they just have fountain drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here once and have nothing bad to say. The Lou Holtz sandwhich was a winner and I look forward to trying other things offered on the menu or making my own creation. The dessert selection was also great, enjoyed eating outside in the little alley."}
{"text":"Awesome food for a great price! The grilled cheese sandwiches are absolutely terrific, and the options are plenty. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in acorn alley with a mom and pop feel, but with tastes that will exceed your expectations beyond belief . Sandwiches are unique and not as expensive as it would seem with the portions and great taste . Recommend to anyone I talk to ."}
{"text":"This place was delicious!  I had the Arsenio Hall which has shaved ribeye, caramelized onions, mushrooms, green peppers, provolone and mayo.  It basically tasted like a philly cheese sandwich but with perfectly grilled toast.  One thing to note, the sandwiches, or at least my sandwich, didn't come with fries, you have to ask for fries when you order. This place made my first trip to Kent all the better!  Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Very solid establishment! I got the Arsenio Hall and it was legit! Satisfied customer, can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Yumm yumm yumm best grilled cheese sandwich place hands down. People are friendly and great service"}
{"text":"Had the mac and cheese bites, very tasty. For my sandwich I had the Chrissie Hynde and every ingredient on it was great and fresh. I'm a vegetarian and they had some nice meat free options to pick from.  Very nice, large portion of food. The sandwiches do not come with fries automatically so if you want them remember to order them. I can't wait to get tater tots next time. I also had an Oreo milkshake which was perfect.  I liked that every sandwich was named after someone connected to Kent. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"We were looking for something quick and light one evening on the way to Summit Racing.  The wife stumbled upon this place here on Yelp so we checked it out.  Very cool place with a huge selection of gormet grilled cheese sandwiches.   Clean, friendly staff, and good food.   We'll be sure to stop again next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches and sides.  We were looking for something different than the normal fast food/pizza for lunch and this fit the bill.  I ordered takeout through the yelp app and our order was perfect and completed on time.  The sandwiches were all delicious and the portions were generous but not to the point of being impossible to eat.  The prices were very reasonable.  For around the price of a king size fast food combo you can get a sandwich crafted with great ingredients with a side and a drink.  Ravenna Auto Body will definitely be getting Twisted Meltz for lunch again soon"}
{"text":"On a tour visit to Kent State today we stopped at this place for a sandwich here after based on the reviews. Four of us ordered different sandwiches and tried each. While they were all fabulous, we all agreed that James Harrison was our fav. Their menu was huge and had a grilled cheese sandwich for anyone. We also had the Dick Goddard (vege black bean burger melt), the Josh Cribbs (ham and turkey melt), and a Don King (either a double or single burger patty between TWO grilled cheese sandwiches!) Every selection had its own unique flavor combinations and was a perfect balance of crisp butter grilled bread, fillings and gooey melted cheese. They were very impressive.  The reason for four rather than five stars, the atmosphere was bare and boring. There wasn't any decor. They had a nice start to \"hip\" by writing their menu on a chalk board, but that was the end. The seating was old Subway restaurant booths I'm pretty sure. That is kinda uncomfortable for any more than two diners. They offer beer, but not in any environment I'd want to sit and enjoy one in! The regular and sweet potato fries were good, but nothing special. They coat them to get a nice crisp outside. We also got the mac and cheese bites. The sides are just frozen fried food... nothing fresh made.   Then, I'm just not sure how I feel about that tip jar at a counter order restaurant where you clear your own trash after. I get you'll bring out my food when it's done, but with the high pressure jar at the register, you're asking for tips for service, before the service.   This place did have some great melt sandwiches and I can see why it gets great reviews! Definitely a lunch joint to frequent"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  If your familiar w/Melts in Lakewood, well, I'm not a fan of that place, but this place, helz yeah!     They have at least 20 different sandwiches to choose from (give yourself time to read through them! So hard to choose!!)Each is given a celebrity name.  They really pay attention to the taste of the sandwich and don't just throw a bunch of crap together.   Each sandwich had the perfect balance of taste!  Not to cheesy even when there is a couple different cheeses on a sandwich.    We had the Josh Cribs, Thurman Munson & Arsenio Hall.  ALL awesome! The tomato basil soup is good too.  It has a peppery kick.    Looking forward to coming back to try other sandwiches!!"}
{"text":"This was a cute little place with a lot of options. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and didn't rush us while we took our time to look over the menu. The bread was toasted perfectly but I wasn't a huge fan of the buffalo chicken sandwich for $6.99 as it didn't have much spice. The fried pickles however we're very good and affordable at only $3.99"}
{"text":"I've been to Twisted Meltz twice now and was very pleased each time.  Their melts (or metlz?) consist of thick bread toasted perfectly to encapsulate their delicious innards.  It seems as though they use high quality ingredients and I can personally recommend the \"Thurman Munson\" and the \"Arsenio Hall\" and their french fries or o-rings with sriracha ketchup are pretty awesome as well.    I was underwhelmed the first time I tried their tomato soup which made me sad since there is no better accompaniment to a great grilled cheese. However, I plan to give it another chance - they might have changed the soup since then.   The space is somewhat small,, maybe a couple tables and a bar top, but you can order sandwiches to go or find a seat in the patio area (which is enclosed in chilly weather) adjacent to their shop.  Service here is always A+, it's really a friendly place!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! I love the vegan options :) I've never been to a diner that offers vegan options so I was a little bit surprised! I love avocados and as Soon as I saw them on the menu, I lost all sense of self. What's better than this ? Guys being dudes"}
{"text":"This is really a great place in Kent! The other places that have been in the same building haven't done so well so I hope this place breaks the streak. Great sandwiches which are really inventive and all sound great. I had the one with pork which I believe is a special so I'm not sure if it will be on the menu forever but it was so good. Plenty of vegetarian options and even vegan options Their fries are really great and the staff was very nice and helpful with making our choices and the best condiments to put on them. Really a nice place with a good vibe that is definitely worth finding a parking spot. The ice cream place that is attached was also great and worth it if you're stomach isn't too full!"}
{"text":"This is seriously one of my favorite places to eat in Kent. the prices are awesome for how big the sandwiches are plus the have the belly card so you earn points for going. we order for twisted I would say at least 3 times a month and staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is great I got the josh cribbs and my girlfriend got the arseniol hall. The food came out fast and the service was good. this place is equally as good as the place in Lakewood that gets all the press and you don't have the long wait."}
{"text":"Found our new favorite ice cream shop! Many fun flavors, reasonable prices, generous portions, and good hard ice cream- no runny mess."}
{"text":"Came here with my family on a Wednesday evening. It was extremely clean and family-friendly. Their variety of grilled cheese sandwiches is pretty extensive and the guy that took our order was very friendly and patient. That said, it was a bit overpriced...we had two kids meals (a chicken tender meal that consisted of two tenders and some fries and a grilled cheese meal with a basic grilled cheese) and two \"adult\" grilled cheese combo meals and our total came to close to $40. No appetizers or extras. The food was just ok. I honestly feel like I could have easily duplicated the exact sandwich I got in the comfort of my own kitchen. (I got a grilled cheese with bacon, caramelized onion and pierogi.) I know that they mainly cater to college students and I'm sure I would have loved this place 10 or 15 years ago. Bottom line: If you want to check it out, then go check it out. Just don't expect anything you probably can't make yourself."}
{"text":"Went here when we first moved to Kent. We thought it was just okay. I agree with an earlier reviewer, the food was kind of bland. We prefer Melt and probably wont be back unless we were in acorn alley and didnt have another plan already."}
{"text":"I just have to post a review due to the excellent service I received today. I usually go home on break but was unexpectedly stuck in the office today. I was starving and ordered here because they deliver. I had less than an hour at this point and when I received my confirmation status saying that my delivery would arrive after my break ended, I called to cancel the order. The woman who answered the phone said not to cancel, she would get the order to me asap. She arrived at my office in less than 10 minutes. That was awesome and very much appreciated. The food was also great! I will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"Reuben was good, but Russian dressing wasn't evenly spread out on sandwich. Tots were good but needed a little salt. Otherwise I really enjoyed this place. I loved the references to the Kent State famous alumni and famous area names."}
{"text":"First the good, and most important- the food.  I had the Nick Saban and it was delicious. Sourdough was grilled perfectly and the flavor was great. Now to the not so good.  I'm sitting in the small dining area facing 2 TVs. Kinda watching both - crime drama on one and NFL combine on the other.  Suddenly the one is changed from the crime drama to the Cavs game - which was a blowout at the time. But no biggie. I turn my attention to the NFL combine but that was changed to  Rangers / Canadians NHL game as soon as I did. Also not close. Apparently the table behind me wanted the Blue Jackets hockey game. Thanks for asking if I was watching anything.  Still going to give it 4 stars based on the food but left feeling annoyed. PS- If someone had bothered to ask if I minded the channel being changed I probably would have said I didn't mind. And I also probably would have ordered a malt to go."}
{"text":"This place is tucked inside the small alley and is not visible from the street.   Huge menu selection and great tasting food. Also have ice-creams.   Sandwiches are named after people (allegedly KSU Alumini). I tried the Steve Harvey after accidentally ordering something else at first. Wasn't the menu's fault. I take full responsibility for it. Tasted great."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!  Love sitting on the \"patio\" side while we eat and watch people go by.  Must try!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My daughter asks to go here constantly! Try the specials, they are always wonderful. Great staff, quick, delicious food, definitely a place to be a regular!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Kent. Awesome food, creative food choices, and super friendly staff. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Such a creative menu! This is a place that serves burgers on grilled cheese so it's clearly not the most health conscious place, but a lot of fun."}
{"text":"The menu honors famous Kent State alumni, a perfect fit for the college community, and the creative eats are even better than they sound!  Everyone in the family, from the 10 year old to the grandparents found something good to eat.  I went with the James Harrison and loved every bite.  The service was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"This place is great! Love coming here while I'm at school. Love their loaded sandwiches. My favorite is the arsenio hall."}
{"text":"You must try this. I had the James Harrison, might be the best sandwich I've ever had. We got three different sandwiches. The other two were very good as well. Did not get any sides or dessert, but I'm sure they would be of equal quality. It's tucked away, but not hard to get to."}
{"text":"Very quant, quirky atmosphere with deli-shish heart attack  sandwiches. My wife and I met up here for lunch."}
{"text":"For anyone who is a fan of the infamous Melt, or just enjoys the concept of specialty grilled cheese would love this local, interpretation of that! its a small diner style area, great for a quick lunch or relaxed dinner. A great perk: they have an ice cream parlor connected on the other side, for a post meal dessert. Fun fact: all of the sandwiches are named after Kent State alumni for an added local flare."}
{"text":"Food was great, but the Lou Holtz was nowhere near as juicy as one would think. The Drew Carey, however paid fitting homage to Mr. Carey himself, as the sandwich was almost as spicy as his \"bod.\""}
{"text":"I love twisted meltz sooo much. The food is delicious and reasonably priced and the employees are so nice!"}
{"text":"All the sandwiches are really creative and it's fun to try new things everytime. They have super good battered fries. I always leave in a total food coma. Greasy, but I think that is what you're probably expecting."}
{"text":"The service is great as is the food. My only complaint is that the tomato basil soup was just too spicy for my taste.  Everything else was a great as the last time we ate here"}
{"text":"Such a cool little spot tucked away in an alley. Got the Arsenio Hall Melt... it was so good!! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ok I went with my wife. We enjoyed it but  thought it a little greasy   still it's a nice place and the people working there were nice"}
{"text":"The food was super good, I enjoyed it far more than anytime I've had Melt! I had the James Harrison which had a lot of onions so if that's not your kind of thing I would avoid it. Service was a little slow; it took over 25 minutes for our food to come out but it was worth it in the end."}
{"text":"As a grilled cheese lover, the five stars drew me in. I should hold have left immediately as the place smelled like a grease pit. And so did the sandwiches. One bite from each was all we could handle. Walked out and deposited them in the trash can at the end of Acorn Alley. Never again. I would have given it no stars if I could."}
{"text":"Not much seating,  but great little sandwich shop tucked away in the alley with gluten free bread that is very good!"}
{"text":"I had a Steve Harvey sandwich and an order of pierogies. The sandwich was fantastic a good texture and the right amount of spice and depth with the spicy mayo. Although there was an issue with the payment (the waitress forgot to apply my bogo free sandwich) when I brought it to their attention they were quick to resolve. Food was great and I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Lots of different things to try!! It's delicious. Can't go wrong with melted cheese combined with anything lol. Staff very nice and helpful. Place was clean, in downtown Kent so awesome area to walk off all of the deliciousness ;) will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Visiting from canada on business and we stopped by this place for lunch and it was excellent.  Will def come back whenever visiting kent"}
{"text":"I try not to do too many five star reviews, but Twisted Meltz definitely earns 5! Their food is fantastic! Such a cool concept and unique menu, and it's all delicious!   I have tried 5 different melts from there now and all 5 have been stellar! I have also tried many of their appetizers and they have all been wonderful as well.  But the real reason for the 5 star review? Their accuracy of their delivery service!! Getting this menu delivered to your door is amazing. But it's more than that. I have had Twisted Meltz delivered probably about 15-20 times and EVERY SINGLE TIME the order has been correct! As in 100% right every time! And you order and pay with an app!  5 stars for delicious food, huge menu, great and accurate service and delivery, and a very nice and easy to use app! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Like a more affordable and more accessible Melt bar and grill. The sandwiches are creatively made and amazingly delicious. The (battered!) fries are also quite good. The staff is swift and friendly and you can just walk right next door for a tasty ice cream dessert. I'm never waiting 1+ hour to get a table in lakewood ever again, I'm a twisted meltz convert. Can't wait to see what inventive specials you come up with :D (Your take on the turkey dinner was a homerun!)"}
{"text":"Twisted Meltz is my favorite restaurant in downtown  Kent! If you're a fan of grilled cheese or just cheese in general, this is the place for you!  In general, it's very similar to Melt Bar & Grilled in Cleveland. The restaurant itself isn't very big on the inside, but the food leaves a big impact. I always get the Lou Holtz, and would recommend it over any of the other sandwiches.   Overall, if you only have one day in Kent, make this restaurant a stop on your visit."}
{"text":"Delicious. Not crazy expensive like some competitors. Nice people. Relaxed atmosphere. We had three different sandwiches at the table and we all loved each of them."}
{"text":"A must try if in Kent State. I'd be here once a week if I went to school here or lived close. I tried both the James Harrison and Arsenal Hall... and both were incredible. The local vibe it gives off makes it a perfect fit for a hip downtown deli/cafe. Very popular place and staff was still upbeat and brought good energy to the experience.   All around good experience and if you're thinking of any other place for lunch do yourself a favor and just come here."}
{"text":"Was very good! The grilled cheese on Texas toast was FANTASTIC! Additionally, the staff was friendly and got us seated right away.  The only thing you should note is that the food is fairly greasy, but that's a given.  Definitely somewhere to try when you're looking for something heavy and delicious to eat."}
{"text":"First time here was last night for dinner.  Choices were unlimited and each sandwich had a fun name.  Friendly service! Portions were very large! Sandwiches were not as \"flavorful\" as I had hoped. Sat outside which was nice."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. It gives big portions and for a reasonable price. I like how it's not a huge inside place to eat and it's in the shape of a diner. There is so much to chose from on the menu it takes a while to look at everything! I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"First visit here and it was a good experience. Food was good, service was pleasant and prices were reasonable.  I will try it again."}
{"text":"Really great sandwich. Tater tots were awesome too!!  Ghost pepper cheese was awesomely hot!  We went back and I think it was even better the next time. Love it."}
{"text":"I had the \"Chrissie Hynde\" vegetarian sandwich and split an order of sweet potato fries with my mom! Food definitely met my expectation, although it's not something I would eat regularly. The only qualm I have is that the location is rather difficult to get to, especially in the winter months due to lack of parking in downtown Kent. That being said, Twisted Meltz does offer delivery which I have not had the chance to try yet. I'd recommend this place to anyone who needs to get their gourmet grilled cheese fix and is friendly to vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Lots of creative choices and amazing prices (about $10 for a combo) for the quality and quantity of food you get. I go about once a week and have always had something different and it's always been wonderful. With fried onion rings and fried macaroni and cheese available on a sandwich, this CLEARLY isn't health food, nor does it claim to be. The guys who work in the shop are all really personable and make you feel welcomed as soon as you walk in. I'm so glad this place is in Kent!"}
{"text":"Cool themed restaurant with a variety of good sandwiches. Definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a cheaper version of Melt Bar & Grill, but it is just as tasty!  This location is a small hole in the wall, literally, but they are friendly and fairly quick.  Their fries are very different from what I'm used too, but good.  I ordered the Wayne Dawson, it was wonderful in flavor, but messy, like a sloppy joe.  I can't give them 5 stars because I wish they would have had better napkins than those dinky things that come from the holder and I would have liked a utensil of some sort.  A fork or spoon would have been nice as my sandwich kept falling apart."}
{"text":"Great and delicious food, but their delivery service is terrible. We waited almost two hours, and when trying to call the restaurant, were placed on hold for an extended amount of time. Yummy sandwiches, fantastic Mac and cheese bites, but eat in. The restaurant is always clean and is definitely a great spot to eat in, especially in acorn alley. The Joe Walsh and Arsenio sandwiches are amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place - the sandwiches are inventive and there is something for everyone (unlike the other grilled cheese places that try too hard and make gross weird sandwiches)! The sandwiches are HUGE and inexpensive. AND they deliver. New favorite place."}
{"text":"I got the Don King and it was one of the best melts I've ever had. Also, great sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"My friend and I went after an event at KSU and really enjoyed dinner here! We both had sandwiches with fries and everything was cooked perfectly. You could tell the food was fresh and cooked with care!"}
{"text":"They have very tasty sandwiches. I had the \"Joe Walsh\" last time and will definitely go back to try others!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's local, cheap, and delicious. Organizations have fundraisers here frequently -  so it's a charitable business as well. I always get the Steve Harvey, and it's DELICIOUS. If you're in Kent, it's definitely worth a try. Explore Acorn Alley and downtown while you're here :)"}
{"text":"Have only had the Lou Holtz and Dri Archer thus far. But some the best sandwiches I've ever had!!  Big menu to keep trying out. So the outlook is great!!"}
