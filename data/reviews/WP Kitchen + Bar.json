{"text":"Don't know why I have waited so long to officially review WP Kitchen, I've gone at least 6 times this past year. Service has been excellent each visit. We typically sit at the bar or at the bar tables, the bartenders are two of our favorites. Crab cakes are some of the best in Charlotte, mushroom pizza is also a favorite. The Wolfgang brand of wine is actually really good as well"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the new menu of WP and incredibly miss the old menu with the focus on pizzas. The food now is sub par and overpriced honestly. I don't know if they are trying to appeal to a different audience, but I highly suggest reverting back to the old menu that had better food and had a more organized focus. When I went a friend asked for a Caesar salad (like the old menu) and they claimed they could not even make that... Let alone all the other delicious items on the old menu. #bringbackwolfgangpucks"}
{"text":"Sunday family dinner portions are very small. Portions are less than half sized. Dessert is a joke. One pudding cup and one small cookie to be shared by four people. We were each given a spoon and I suspect we were expected to pass the pudding cup around after having a taste. Apple tart was brought out with a tiny scoop of ice cream. Food quality was good but the portions are so small that everyone left hunger. Not enough food to feed four people. Terrible value. We have eaten there numerous times but will not be back.

I asked server what has happened with the menu and portion sizes and was informed corporate has set new standards. I was told that lots of regulars have complained."}
{"text":"Hmm, I used to love this place before they changed the menu. They had closed the place down for weeks for refurbishment although nothing inside seemed different. Tonight, at 8pm on a Friday, it was less than half full. Still, the service was slow, as I watched our waiter chat with his co-workers. I'm the kind of person who looks for the good in a situation but was having a hard time here. I ordered a pesto pizza which came with a lot of salad greens dumped on top, making it soggy. I'm sorry Mr Puck, I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"We have been here more than 5 times, since it was Wolfgang Pucks. The food has been good for the most part, but the service needs serious work. The waitstaff is not very experienced. Seems they aren't familiar with the actual items on the menu. For this location and the prices, people expect smooth and consisten service. Not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"I was expecting more from WP. The menu- hard to glance at, no commas, no way to quickly differentiate what the dish was and what its ingredients were. So you had to sit there and read through the entire menu. 

The interior did not change. So I expected the food to be new and exciting. I had hope...

The fried calamari was average! Similar to a place like applebees except maybe applebees has a better crisp to em. The aioli was heavy on the creamy side. It was a uninspired fried dish. 

The mac and cheese was probably the worst. The inside was luke warm, pasta was very firm. It tasted like they just had it already made for a while then nuked it in the microwave before serving. The crisp on top was raw- it looked like raw bread crumbs- no dark browning at all. 

I would not reorder these items.  I would reorder the smoked salmon bruschetta. There was a pleasant amount of crisp, fresh mixed veggies atop my thinly sliced smoked salmon. 

I enjoyed the service. They always get that part right.  But WP is a very safe restaurant. Their food is decent. The choices/offerings are not very exciting tho.  Very middle of the road."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant again.  This is the third time I have had a bad experience here and it has never been about the food.  A friend and I decided to have lunch today.  I arrived early and walked in at 11:10am.  It is very chilly in charlotte today and was happy to find a warm spot.  A gentleman sitting at the bar turned around and looked at me like \"what are you doing here?\" And then reminded the hostess(like I am not standing right there) that they do not open until 11:30.  She then repeated what I just heard him say??  I get it that you don't open until 11:30, but if your front door is open and someone walks in (with less than 20 minutes to wait) wouldn't you say \"we don't start serving lunch until 11:30, but we would be happy to seat you and get you a drink\". There are too many great restaurants in Charlotte now to go to ones that don't appreciate customers.  I left and met my friend a Cafe Monte which is right around the corner and always delicious, friendly and packed with happy customers."}
{"text":"WP used to be a regular for us. Every week or two. But whoever runs the menu keeps dropping out favorites: butternut squash soup, roasted cauliflower with banana peppers, chopped broccolini with garlic, the best roasted potatoes, and stone fruit salad. We have no idea why these were dropped. Our friends are astounded as well."}
{"text":"Great experience as usual. 

Had the Springer Mountain chicken and apple salad, my girlfriend had the salmon and kale salad. They were excellent.

This is a great spot to enjoy a night out, the music selection is excellent and it always has a great atmosphere.

We always sit in the bar, the bartenders, Michael and Scott are awesome. They get to know everyone and make them feel like old friends.  We love trying the new cocktails that Michael comes up with, they are always so tasty and different."}
{"text":"We recently dined at WP Kitchen & Bar with our three children.  When we arrived the restaurant was almost empty. While we were seated immediately, and our drink orders were taken quickly, the service from that point declined.  The service was so slow and when my son's pizza came out it was way overcooked- the crust was almost completely black.  Then the apple cobbler was way undercooked with most of the apples tasting like they were raw- not exactly what you expect with a cobbler.  I have eaten here on many other occasions and been pleased with both he service and food.  However after dropping $200 for a below average meal and slow service it is unlikely I will return any time soon."}
{"text":"Everything about this experience was excellent! Service was amazing! Atmosphere was awesome. Food was delicious!!!! We ordered hummus & pita as an appetizer and devoured it. So yummy. The serving size was large and perfect to share. 
I ordered a pasta dish which was so tasty. My friend ordered their bbq chicken pizza - much bigger than expected! Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu! 
Oh, and drink specials were $6 on thursdays!"}
{"text":"Went here expecting something special and different and it would up being a pizza restaurant. My friend had some sort of fish dinner and it was horrible and would up getting a chicken cutlet. I played safe and got a steak and it was okay and nothing special. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was inspired to try this restaurant after watching David Chang's \"Ugly Delicious\" episode about pizza where Wolfgang makes an appearance and talks pizza crust with Chang. 

The restaurant is located in a lovely shopping center. Parking was slim, but there is valet if you like. We opted to sit outside, because it was a little noisy inside, but it was kind of hot and there were a ton of flies so I probably wouldn't recommend that.

We started with the BBQ shrimp, NOLA style, which was delicious. I could have drank a bowl of the broth the shrimp were in! For my entree I got the truffled mushroom pizza, which was just fabulous with goat cheese and baby spinach. I enjoyed it so much!

The service was great, and I'm only sorry I was too full to try dessert!"}
{"text":"We usually come here for lunch or dinner whenever we travel to Charlotte. We love the pizza here and recently tried the pumpkin soup they have as an appetizer and it is amazing. Do yourself a favor and try that. Their burgers also never disappoint and their fries are just perfect. They have a good beer selection as well. I did try one of their mixed drinks recently and it was terrible though, so I would stay away from those."}
{"text":"If you love a big circular bar area, with choices galore, this is it! The place is gorgeous! I love how simply professional the staff are too - not just well versed with the menu but these are the kind of people you want to hang around with. Love it! Good food and great service. Not much else one could ask for. Food? No brainer. Always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I came here with a pretty large group for a work event. I didn't know they had gone through a \"revamp\" on the menu. So I was pleasantly surprised with some of the options. 

We started with wine and the grilled octopus, cheese and meat tray and handmade meatballs. They were all pretty tasty but the highlight for me were the meatballs.

For dinner everyone tried something different but believe it or not none of us ordered pizza! We sampled salmon, turkey bologonese and spaghetti and meatballs. 

Everything we sampled was tasty, but nothing that I tried  knocked my socks off and makes me want to rush back. 

But to be fair, on my next visit I'll try the pizza and update my review!"}
{"text":"The dude and I wanted to pop in for a quick drink and appy before we went out for the evening and stopped by WP around 920 on a Thursday. We made sure they closed at 10 , with the host, as soon as we walked in because we didn't want to be THOSE people. Sat down at the bar and the bartender asked us if we were going to eat to which we replied 'maybe' because honestly we were more interested in cocktails. Bartender tosses menus in front of us and says 'kitchen closes in 15 minutes and we close in 20' COME ON NOW DUDE. I know what that means, we looked at cocktail selections for maybe 60 seconds more, in which, during that time the bartender was slamming things around and I can hear him swearing under his breath. Boo dude, boo! We left. He clearly didn't was us there so we didn't want to stay. Cool location, normally pretty decent service but this bartender just turned us off to the whole thing."}
{"text":"We had a delicious meal here tonight and were actually quite impressed that we liked it better than the previous iteration of WP. Erin, our server, was fantastic. We had the brick chicken calabrese and linguini diavalo, which were both very good. The only negative was the handmade meatballs, very overpriced at $8 for 3 small meatballs (which still did taste quite good). We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I live near this restaurant and decided to stop in for lunch. It was so good. The staff was extremely friendly and the customer service was top notch. The environment is warm and welcoming. The decor is very nice. Now what's most important is the food and it was amazing. Will definitely return and recommend others give it a try."}
{"text":"WP Kitchen + Bar is my neighborhood restaurant, sometimes it slips out of my mind and every time I return I ask myself why don't I eat here more often?  We popped in for Sunday brunch, our server greeted us with half off Bloody Marys and Mimosas, stop, you had me at hello.

We ordered the NC Apple Salad, with bleu cheese and candied walnuts. It was a perfectly balanced salad. It was a wave of flavors with every bite. Our server was very pleasant, he did not have the Sunday blues.

And again I left thinking I need to eat here more and I must write my Yelp review. Done and done."}
{"text":"Hands down the most joyful restaurant staff I've ever encountered. The food was great but the service was EVEN BETTER! I came in during yelp restaurant week and there were teenagers everywhere and the staff were so kind and just as courteous with ALL patrons regardless if they were the \"usual crowd\" which isn't the norm on this side of town in my experience. Really really impressed me and I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"I got the kitchen bar burger and a side of brussel sprouts - they were awesome! The bacon aioli and red onion marmalade were great additions as toppings to the burger. Half price local draft beers during happy hour too!"}
{"text":"We have been to WP at least 8-10 times over the last couple of years. We've consistency had not only great food but excellent service. Admittedly on my last trip in about a month ago, I felt our waiter cared more about an overlooked item than the manager showed in his remarks. But we will continue coming back. We love the atmosphere and many of the menu items!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful on all fronts! Excellent service, wonderful food, great drinks, and a warm and comfortable atmosphere. Everything is made in-house and you can tell! We had hummus and pita for an appetizer, two schnitzels, and pizza and pasta for the kids. The food was flawless...I'd recommend any of it. 

Our server was wonderful. She answered all of our questions and promptly gave us whatever we asked for. I told her how much we loved the pita bread and she even brought us an extra serving to take home when she gave us the bill. (In case a manager is reading this, I didn't catch her name but she was tall, awesome southern accent, and had blond hair in a braid.)

Add that to great drinks and a pretty restaurant and this was a perfect experience. Thanks!"}
{"text":"During Yelp week we decided to give this place a whirl to see what all the brouhaha was about.  Well . . . WP Kitchen scored a solid 4-stars with all in our party of four (two of us even gave it a 5, except my burger was overcooked and lacked flavor).

Our server, Brian, was exactly what we were in the mood for:  someone laid back, not pushy, and mostly out of sight until we need him.  Thanks, Brian!  We basically ordered two entrees:  two of us ordered the burger and the other two ordered the trout.  Let's just say the trout aced the burgers with them both moaning and groaning about how good it was.  Almost embarrassingly like the scene in Katz's Deli straight out of \"Harry Loves Sally.\"  I'll have what they're having, LOL.  Get a room.  

For burgers, delectable trout, a couple bottles of wine, apps, and drinks at the bar, as a group we laid out over $300, but then the Yelp 30% food discount kicked in.  We gave it to Brian for attending to us so well.  I say \"Give 'em a whirl\" when in South Park.  Nice, laid back place to chill with good friends, good food, good drink, and memorable times."}
{"text":"To be honest, I had no idea this place was here. I really enjoyed the outdoor patio Yelp event where I had the opportunity to try several menu items as well as a summer cocktail made with lemonade and thyme. Everything was excellent! The pizza was delightful and I will be back for more. The restaurant is open and industrial, yet warm and cozy. This would be an excellent date night spot. The manager discussed the nightly drink specials which most definitely will contribute to my return!"}
{"text":"Great location, nice modern industrial decor. The food was really tasty. Between the four of us, we ordered two chicken bacon burgers, the salmon dish, the trout, and the meatballs.

The food portions were on the bigger side, so bring your appetite or be prepared to get a to-go box. My other family members claimed that their dishes were really good with two family members complaining about the chicken bacon burger being too spicy.

As for my dish, I ordered the pan seared salmon, and it was delicious. The flavors were perfect, and it was cooked exactly as I asked.

As for service- the service was prompt and professional. We were greeted at the door immediately and warmly, shown to our seats right away, and our server never let our water glasses go down. 

As far as atmosphere- it's a nice open and airy atmosphere. It was a bit dark inside, so you may need to use your light on your phone to read the menu if you have issues with seeing.

Also be aware that it is not the best atmosphere for people who are hard of hearing. The music + people talking made for a noisy atmosphere. This is probably not your best choice if you're looking for a quiet dinner.

Overall, I'd eat here again- just probably not with my family since they all have hearing problems! Haha"}
{"text":"We thought the food was so awesome we came back the very next week. The pizza and meatballs are fantastic. Our waiter Garret was awesome and super attentive and even remembered what we ordered the first time when we came back! Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I like the layout of the restaurant and I think I had the best pizza in the town last night. My friend had a pork dish which he liked too. Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Great Thursday Date Night! Chose to visit here for Yelp Restaurant Week and it was really a great choice. Excellent selection of beverages and cocktails, paired with a wonderful bartender. He made the perfect extra dirty martini for my friend. So pleased!! I again enjoyed an OMB Copper. It's best on draft so I'd rather enjoy it when I'm out and about.
Our waitress was on point. She greeted us in a timely manner, had our calamari out so fast it's as if she read our minds, and while she was incredibly attentive, she also let us enjoy the company of each other without too many interruptions. 
The calamari was perfectly seasoned, not rubbery at all and the grilled fresh lemon for drizzling was exactly what I wanted! We ordered the K+B Burger and Margarita Pizza for entrees. My friend LOVED the burger and the 'onion jelly', his words, that was spread on the bottom bun. He stuffed himself trying to finish it because he couldn't get enough. The fries paired with the burger were crisp and salted to perfection. Truly delicious. 
I ordered and thoroughly enjoyed he margarita pizza. Few places add it to the menu and even fewer do it right. Not too much mozzarella and it was prepared so well I didn't feel like I was choking when trying to eat. Some restaurants really over do it and then don't cook the cheese well so it's lumped in your throat as you eat. 
We did not choose to get dessert but the app and entrees were so good, I don't think this sweet tooth missed too much (at least I hope not!!)."}
{"text":"We ate here on Christmas Eve. We had visited once before and had a few issues. The manager had tracked us down and asked us to give them another try.  We couldn't have had a better experience. The manager was gracious and remembered the previous event. The food was excellent. We had the cheese board appetizer and I highly recommend it. It was unlike any I have had before. Absolutely delicious!!  My husband had the Wiener schnitzel. The portion was huge and it was delicious. My Four Cheese Ravioli was excellent as well. A perfect evening with great food and service. Also had the Crabcake appetizer, also excellent.  My husband commented that we hadn't even left and he was looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I have visited WP Kitchen and Bar three times because I like the atmosphere and the location - and I really wanted it to be a \"favorite\" place to go. Unfortunately, all three times I had issues. The first time, our pizza came out cold. The second time, my mussels came out barely cooked - the shells were barely opened . The third time we walked in on a Monday - they weren't that busy and my husband and I sat at the bar.  The bartender never acknowledged us - there were only two other people at the bar. I finally asked for a wine list and it took another 10 minutes for him to return. I ordered a beet salad that had no protein on it - no chicken, steak or seafood and it was $15.00. When it came out it was so small, I thought the bartender made a mistake and gave me a side salad instead.
Sorry - I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Good food.  I enjoyed the The chicken burger to go. The food arrived at my hotel at the right temperature and tasted very good. The only negative, was that they forgot to bring silverware and napkins. Otherwise, very good experience and would recommend."}
{"text":"If you want high blood pressure, eat at this restaurant. From our appetizers to our main meals, we only tasted excessive salt. The food was quite inedible. The Chef needs to be replaced as he did not include the ingredients listed on the menu in several dishes. The service was slow and pitiful. A restaurant in need of an overhaul !"}
{"text":"The food was very good.  The ravioli is really tasty and we couldn't get enough of the sauce. The spicy chicken pizza was no joke. It is spicy.  My only drawback personally is that a lot of the choices involved seafood (especially the appetizers) and I'm not a seafood person. It's also fairly pricey outside of some pasta and pizzas.  But again, the food is very good!"}
{"text":"We went here for a big family dinner (including two kids) and had the best experience. From the moment we got there, the service was perfect, they knew the menu inside and out and repeatedly checked on us to see if we needed anything else. They have a wide variety of wine, alcohol and North Carolina beer on the menu.

I would recommend the WP Apple Salad - apparently its the most ordered item on the menu and I can see why, it's incredible! I got some grilled chicken on it and it made it even better.  The BBQ chicken pizza and pepperoni pizza were also ordered at my table and I had a bite of both and was impressed.

We got the calamari as an appetizer and really enjoyed it! You should be able to find parking around the shopping center but if not, I believe they have valet."}
{"text":"We really liked this place when it was Wolfgang Puck Pizza Bar and had every intention of getting our usual pizzas when we walked in the other evening, only to find that everything had changed!  Well, not EVERYTHING, but some very important things.  The layout of the place is essentially the same and we didn't realize anything had changed until we sat down and looked at a menu.  What used to be a menu stocked full of good pizzas like the roasted mushroom is now a menu with small plates, Italian dishes, and a much-condensed pizza list with a lesser version of my old favorite.  One thing that hasn't changed is the $7/pint draft beers!  

With the reality of the new menu setting in, we were strongly urged (a bit too strongly if you ask me) to order some small plates to get started as this appears to be the new focus.  We got some calamari and a salad to share.  Both were tasty but not memorable.  We also got a couple of pizzas, I went with the mushroom which was fine but not as good as the prior one.  

On its own merit without considering what it used to be, this place is fine but not outstanding.  You have the valet option which is strongly recommended as parking is horrid.  You have the long waits if you don't make reservations.  You have the pretty good wait staff which is now laser focused on getting customers to try the new dishes.  You have a solid and well-rounded menu, some nice wine, beer, and cocktail options.  And you have the large bill at the end.  

We used to drive out of our way to go here but probably won't anymore.  It's pretty good but there is no longer anything that stands to me.  We miss the old Pizza Bar...."}
{"text":"I really enjoy WP! Super good food. Their pizza is to dieeeee for. A cool place with a nice atmosphere! I have trouble picking what I want off the menu because of so many good and yummy choices! Not many beers on the menu that are more the \"common\" ones especially on draft. Would recommend to anyone to try!"}
{"text":"Great dinner!  Very close to the Hampton Inn so we were able to walk there.  We had spaghetti and the southern pecan pie - everything was great - and the service was great!  Also, enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant!  Had an excellent evening!"}
{"text":"This is a new concept of Wolf Gang Pucks and it's delicious! Hearty flavors make up his menus here. When you first walk in you see the huge bar (they've got craft cocktails), which sits in the middle of the casual/elegant dining room. Whether it's for dinner or lunch, request a booth if you can.

In the chilly weather, my favorite to start out with is a cup of Squash soup: chunks of roasted pumpkin, with cardamom cream and pumpkin oil on top. 

Salad wise: the NC Apple Salad has a ton of thin apple slices on it, which i love! It comes with buttermilk blue cheese, frisee, arugula, radicchio, candied walnuts, and is tossed in a sherry vinaigrette.

Pasta: Trofie. It's one of the pricier on the menu but when you taste it you won't regret the splurge! This pasta tossed with braised lamb, tomato, roasted sweet onions, porcini mushroom, and a cured egg yolk."}
{"text":"I was there on September 17, 2017.  My wife and I ordered Hummus with veggies, She had chicken burger with lettuce instead of buns and I had the Pepperoni Pizza.  The Hummus was delicious.  My pizza had no cheese on it, no firm/crispy crust and just wasn't very good.  I attempted to eat the pizza by holding a slice and all ingredients slid off because crust was too soft.  I had one slice and had to eat it with a fork.  The chicken burger was inedible secondary to too much salt.  I gave 2 stars because they did admit the food sucked and comped it, the hummus was good, and good wine."}
{"text":"Haven't been in several months.  had the Bolognese.  it had no flavor and the rigatoni was hard and out of a box.  very disappointing.  bad entrée!  I will not go again."}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed. Had two cocktails and the duck feature of the night. The duck was delicious, however portion sizes were extremely small for a $25 plate. I left still slightly hungry wishing there was more on the plate. Service was just ok as well. Overall nothing blew me away or left an impression."}
{"text":"Went here the past weekend for the 1st time.  Great food.  My date and I ordered a pepperoni pizza a piece and an order of fries as the appetizer.  Pizza tastes great!! One of the top 2 Pizzas ive ever tasted.  The fries are amazing! Perfect taste and seasoning, nice and crispy.  The price is high for a pizza, but its worth giving a try.  Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the Southpark are. The food is always consistently delicious. Some of my favorite dishes are the apple salad with grilled salmon and pizza (any kind). I've not had anything I didn't like. It can be on the pricey side, but they have citipass coupons and participate in restaurant weeks."}
{"text":"I had Saturday lunch plans with my mother at Cafe Monte, but when we arrived we were told we'd have a 45 minute wait. Bordering on hangry, we turned ourselves around and headed to WP. I hadn't been since the rebrand and wanted to scope out the differences.

To be honest, I couldn't determine that much had changed from the Pizza Bar days -- but that's not a bad thing. I always enjoyed my visits before, and this one would be no different.

We were seated immediately. Our server was kind and very professional. I ordered the Turkey Bolognese with Basil Whipped Ricotta, and asked that it be made gluten free. My mother ordered the special; an open-faced sandwich and side salad. A manager brought our dishes, and upon glancing at mine I already knew it looked too good to be true. I spoke up, \"I'd just like to confirm that my dish is gluten free?\" Her eyes widened and she quickly removed the plate, explaining that she would have a new one out directly. She came back with our server, both apologizing profusely. The server had made the note but the kitchen didn't see it. No harm done -- I hadn't started eating. My correct dish came out a few moments later.

There aren't a lot of places in Charlotte where I can get good GF pasta. Not only were the noodles good, but the turkey sauce was delightful and the basil whipped ricotta alone was worth the price of the dish. I could have eaten it straight with a spoon. Delicious.

About the service -- we were well taken care of during our meal, but what really struck me was the thoughtfulness of our hostess. While we were eating, it started raining heavily. We hadn't prepared for a shift in the weather, and noticing this, the hostess mentioned that we could borrow umbrellas for our walk through the parking lot. I was able to zip back in to return them and we went about our afternoon much more comfortable than if we had been drenched due to our poor planning. It was a wonderful gesture.

I also wanted to include a note from my previous visits. Back in the Pizza Bar days, I went with a friend and ordered the Artisanal Cheese & Salume Board. I asked if there was anything the kitchen could do to accommodate for my gluten free diet -- thinking they'd put a few extra apples or cucumbers on the plate for me to enjoy with my cheese. Instead, they sliced up a few GF pizza crusts for me that I was able to treat like flatbread. I was so pleasantly surprised. Any time the kitchen and service staff can make me feel a little more normal despite my dietary restrictions, they've won me as a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and the food was pretty good. I was here during restaurant week but it wasn't packed. Large menu with variety so it would be a great place to bring a group because there is something for everyone. Delicious cocktails!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Grilled Spanish Octopus and the Brick Chicken Calabrese. Loved the Octopus not a fan of the Brick Chichen though it is a customer favorite. My friend had the salmon and she said it was amazing."}
{"text":"Came here after catching a movie on a weeknight to grab a drink.  Was surprised to find out they've done some \"retooling\" of their menu and concept.  Instead of being all about pizzas, they've expanded their menu to include other food options.

The interior space hasn't changed, still a really cool, dim-lit, restaurant... but what is coming out of the kitchen is new.  No worries though, they still have pizza on the menu and it is still very delicious.  After having a beer, we did split a pizza and it was well worth it.

Servers and waitstaff are really keen here... I totally didn't catch the fact they closed at 10pm on a weeknight... and we got there around 9:40ish.... but they did not mention anything until the bartender wanted to get our last-call drinks.  Even when we left, there was still a large table seated and a couple booths still occupied, but I still felt a little bad for making the restaurant \"stay open\" longer than it was agreed upon on their operating hours."}
{"text":"Service fine.  Prices a little high in my opinion.  Pizza was good, salads looked nice.  For some reason I've become a little bit of an octopus snob, and this was just ok.  Just some shapeless lumps, it was ok but no char or grilled flavor at all.   It was fine but there is no reason I feel compelled to go back."}
{"text":"WP does such a great job with every aspect of the dining experience.  I've been coming here for years and have always had outstanding food and service. When friends ask for a recommendation, I'm always quick to recommend WP Kitchen. 
I always try their food specials, as their chefs are skilled and imaginative. 
Great for date night or for drinks with friends."}
{"text":"I can literally see this restaurant from where I live and walk by it almost every night so was looking forward to eating there this past Sunday night. They advertise a 3-course supper on the blackboard outside the restaurant, on their website and in the restaurant which lured us in. However, when we sat down, we were told that because there was only 2 of us, we would have to pay double the advertised price. Nowhere does it say this - and I went back and reviewed the aforementioned places (see picture). Needless to say, we did not order the Sunday Supper and instead ordered a few items that were advertised as part of that meal - e.g. crispy shrimp and calamari, margherita pizza, etc. It tasted ok not great but we will NEVER go back to this restaurant due to its deceptive advertising. Only when we went to pay for the bill was there any mention of the Sunday Supper being for parties of 4 or more. Too bad because this would have been a nice \"go to\" restaurant for its convenient location.

One further comment - we expected to be able to make one selection from each of the 3 courses and the explanation from our server was that you received all listed choices for the Sunday Supper. Never heard of this before - and there should be an option for 2 people for a slimmed down meal."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while and I'm glad I did. They do offer valet parking. I made reservations online. We got sat in a nice and cozy booth. 

They have a decent selection on the menu. We started off with the calamari. It had a beautiful presentation. The calamari was crispy and tender. I got the spaghetti and meatballs for dinner and my husband got the fish. The meatballs were delicious. Soft and flavorful. I love homemade meatballs. My friend got the wiener schnitzel and she loved it. The pork was crispy and juicy. 

Overall, the experience was good. The service was great and the restaurant itself was cozy and inviting."}
{"text":"It actually pains me to write this review. I want to preface my below comments by saying that this is mine and my husband's favorite restaurant  & favorite GOTO on Sundays.

last Sunday's  Food, Service, and Management was right out horrible and would go down in our history of eating in Charlotte these past 7 months as the worst all around experience!  The only good thing about the evening was our poor Server Nathan who is new to the restaurant.

We ordered the 2  appetizer portion of mussels  and 1 appetizer portion of the octopus. His came out on a flat plate dry as the Sahara with none of the broth and 2 wedges of grilled bread points .  His Octopus was so cold , tough and rubbery.  My husband complained to the waiter.  Who also was upset about the food.

My mussels also came  out on a plate with so much \"tomato\" \"sauce\" and a pound of garlic.  The sauce was so thick, salty and pasty.  I ate 3 pcs and my tongue burned so bad from all the garlic & salt, I had to return it.  

The manager finally  comes over, mind you she never came over to see how we were doing. In a restaurant with 6 tables occupied so they were not busy.   Maybe because she was busy hanging with her friends by the bar and kitchen maybe that is what she was unaware of the crap coming out of her kitchen!  

Let's just say her approach was curt and lacked empathy.  She came from behind me speaking to me and the words that came out of her mouth... \"WOULD YOU LIKE US TO FIRE YOU UP ANOTHER ORDER OF MUSSELS?\"  That pissed me off!  If the cook didn't get it right the first 2x why would it be right the third time.  She didn't say \"I'm sorry for your experience , how can I make it right....\"  No acknowledgement or regards for the crap she and her kitchen staff served that night.  Let's just say it will be a while before we eat there again!  When we do it will only be when Stephen the other Manager who works there and actually cares about the food, customers , and the customers' experience!"}
{"text":"Birthday celebration for my husband at WP Kitchen! We loved it!! The food was amazing. The portion sizes are just right. I recommend trying something new. Don't just go for the typical pepperoni pizza (although I am sure its amazing), trust the chef  and go for a new experience! You will love the food."}
{"text":"We came with our two kids for dinner on a Saturday night.  It happened to be yelp restaurant week so we got 30% off for checking in.  We started off with calamari that was cooked perfectly and the sauce that goes with it was nice.  The kids got cheese pizzas.  We would have been good with them ordering one and splitting as the kids pizza was big - note my kids are under 10.  My husband and I got small salads - he the Cesar and I the apple and blue cheese.  Both were very large portions and a great value.   We ordered the mushroom and truffle pizza and it was awesome.  The crust and flavors were great.  I also got the grilled octopus ( what can I say I like octopus ). It was also wonderful.   Service was a little spotty.  I believe our server was tasked with too many tables.  He was nice enough however.  Definitely would return."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday celebration and wound up getting the Queens feast special, Spanish octopus, grilled salmon, and chocolate chip cookies- incredible!!!! My husband got the beet salad, stuffed trout, and bourbon apple crumble. We were very happy with the service, contemporary atmosphere and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I am always concerned about going \"corporate\" but I really enjoyed WP. 
We started w meatballs that were seasoned well were not \"overworked\" so very tender. 
Then I ordered the octopus small plate and holy cow, it was amazing. Not chewy at all, nicely charred and just the right portion size. My friend had the Weiner Schnitzel that he said tasted good, although one really has to be okay eating a breaded and fried thin piece of meat to truly enjoy it... :)
The ambience of the restaurant was lovely, noise level just right. 
I didn't give 5 stars bc server flubbed my order twice, but she was so personable and it was such a nice evening, it's not like it ruined anything. 
I would go back in a minute."}
{"text":"We visited in May and we had a large group.  The servers were so attentive and our food was delivered without delay.  Impeccable.

The food was absolutely delicious.  Every dish we sampled, no matter how simple, was executed perfectly.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"My wife and returned for our second visit within the last year. We split an tuna poke appetizer. It was tasty and hit the spot. I prefer my poke either chopped fine or at least chopped into small pieces, the was actually good so the larger chunks were ok with us. For our main course we split a BBQ chicken pizza. When it arrived the crusr was literally charded or more correctly burned. Since i love the crust, this was a big deal to me. My wife not so much. When the waitress finally returned i told her the crust was burned , she took a glance and laughed, I see that, she said, \"those boys in kitchen, they have a tendency to burn things from time to time. She chuckled again snd left our table. I literally wanted to hurl the plate of pizza like \"foodfight\" in Animal House. I however, refrained, paid by bill and left. I will never be back to this place. Its mediocre at best. The burned pizza was the last straw for us. If you have low expectations or are just desperate to eat then go on in, anything else, seek a better meal elswhere. SEE PICS OF CHARRED PIZZA."}
{"text":"I would give more than 5 stars if I could. My whole experience at WP kitchen was excellent!
We started off with a very generous sized muscle appetizer, the broth the mussels were in was amazing! Our dinners were delicious, I ordered a  pizza which was perfectly cooked, a tad bit too greasy but once I got rid of the grease it was ones of the best pizzas I've ever had. Oh and lastly, their wine selection is great!!!"}
{"text":"Consistent on food and service.  I have been here for lunch, dinner and brunch and have no major complaints.  My friends tend to think its a little salty, but that's how I like it.  You can't go wrong with a pizza, but try an entrée for a change. I recently had the spicy chicken sandwich and was blown away with how much I liked it.  The pepperoncini aioli was amazing!"}
{"text":"WP is one of our favorite restaurants. I am in disbelief that it doesn't have better rating overall. It's modern and rustic inside at the same time. Even though it's in Philips Place, it's NOT pretentious at all. I love good food but can't stand some of the restaurants in Southpark that are so snobby. We've eaten here about 6 times now and have tried the steak, beef burger, turkey burger when it was on the menu, meatballs, Wiener schnitzel, salads, pizza and chicken burger. Never a bad meal and always great service. 

They have a great selection of wines and I've had the cocktail with bourbon, maple syrup and mint. It was delicious but the cocktails are pricey. I think about $13. Out of everything we have tried, the chicken bacon burger is the hands down favorite. They grind the bacon along with the chicken so that the burger stays moist and has a smoked flavor throughout. Husband and I both ordered it tonight because it's just that good. He gets it with their incredible fries and I ask for a side salad to be health conscious ( yes I know, ground bacon isn't healthy but it is delicious!!)

This place is comfortable but still hip looking and has a beautiful BIG bar area that I love but somehow the place is still kid-friendly. (The pizza is SO GOOD) I don't have kids and not a fan of paying for a meal to be surrounded by kids running wild. I haven't seen that here. There is a small outdoor seating area that I believe is heated in the winter.

Anyway, I wrote this big review because the overall reviews when I looked it up on Yelp was 3.5 and I am in shock. We've eaten here enough times to have a good sense of the place and we've walked away happy every time. Ignore the bad reviews and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Pros:
Quick seating
Friendly staff
Quick service
Great pizzas - really amazing crust

I'm not sure I'd go back. Everything was tasty and the atmosphere is great, but I'd rather go somewhere else for pizza."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Saturday for lunch a dinner were immediately welcomed at the door and ushered in to a warm and inviting atmosphere.
The huge bar is impressive with its selections btw...
Our waitress was VERY knowledgeable about the food and wines and we made our selections based on her advice.
The PEI mussels were \"some of the best we've ever had\". 
Pasta was excellent, salads large and diverse in flavors. Pizza was thin crust and tasty!
It's all good here and we will be back."}
{"text":"They've definitely upped their food game after the renovations and name change - More menu options, and better ones too... some of my faves - the fritto misto shrimp calamari, the spicy chicken pizza, the roasted mushroom pizza, the side of brussels sprouts, and their excellent wine & drink menu! ooh and the salted caramel pudding - definitely get that one.. it was great. In addition to their food and drinks, I'm also a fan of their ambiance and service. What sets WP Kitchen + Bar apart for me is that it's a classy place, perfect for a Saturday night meal with a small group of friends, where you can bring along the baby too... it strikes just the right balance between casual and classy."}
{"text":"I like their high ceiling and decent interior of this restaurant. The food is good. It is not cheap but affordable. You might think some of dishes are over priced because of the name value of the restaurant. Tuna tartare as an appetizer was very fresh and the chip which came with was crispy and thin. They didn't add a lot of sauce on tuna so you can taste fresh tuna.
For main dishes, kitchen burger was good. Guess it was char grilled and enjoyed smoked patty of the burger. Liked thin french fries that came with! Their popular Wiener Schnitzel was a type of crispy pork cutlet(it was said veal on the menu but server informed us that it got changed to pork in advance.) I expected something special on the sauce, sour potatoes that came with but it was just okay. But they cooked pork well like crispy and tender. The service was good and liked the meal overall."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times the past month or so. Food is consistently good.  Truffle Potato chips, pizza and broccolini are solid."}
{"text":"As Johnny V. said, I was expecting a little more from the new WP Kitchen & Bar menu.  We stopped in for lunch on a Monday afternoon, and they had a sign on the door, opening at 12:30 due to inclement weather, although Charlotte didn't get any of the storms expected.  Needless to say we waited ten minutes for the doors to open.
Once seated our waiter arrived with water and was very sweet and friendly. He gave us several minutes to look over the menu and answered some questions regarding some of the selections.
We decided to go with sandwiches, which may have been our fault.  We chose the Turkey Club and Burger.  The Burger by far was worth it, although the bacon aioli was missing a lot of the bacon flavor. As for the club, it was good, but there was so much focaccia bread it overwhelmed the entire sandwich. And, like the aioli on the burger, the aioli on the sandwich had no flavor, very bland I actually added a little salt.  The fries and chips, are two sides, were good. I would say the chips are light and crisp, a nice treat.
Overall, lunch was good, but nothing great.  I will definitely be back to give the pizzas another try, as I remember really enjoying them in the past."}
{"text":"Michael and Scott are two of the best bartenders in Charlotte. They stop to get to know everyone who comes in no matter how busy it is and are very attentive and helpful. The food is consistently great too."}
{"text":"We came out for pre Valentine's Day dinner since tomorrow was booked..The service was great and the food delicious. You will not be disappointed with portions.. it's more than enough. 
I can say that we will be back"}
