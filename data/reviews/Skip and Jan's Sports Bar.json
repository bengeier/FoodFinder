{"text":"If you like to spend a coupla hours playing billiards this place is perfect. Went this morning for brunch & football. Bar/restaurant side is very spacious with lots of TVs - need some respacing btwn them around the bar though.  Well priced food specials & beer; no specialty food to knock your socks off but good standard pub grub at good prices. Very friendly staff take good care of the customers."}
{"text":"Wont go back.. waited 10 minutes at a slow bar... no service... no greeting... so i left... 0 stars if i could"}
{"text":"they brought out all the ingredients to mix my drink and made me make the drink myself... Isn't the point of the bar to get served? That's why they lost their stars other than that it's a good spot"}
{"text":"Decided to give it a solid try, despite previous reviews, which was unfortunate.  I'll give it one star because the place was pretty clean, and one star for having a huge bar with decent service.  I cannot give a star for the pool area itself, as we didn't make it that far.  But I will definitely deduct 2 because the food was awful.  I wish I had thought to take photos, truly.  The nachos were a joke, and my black and blue burger was like a hockey puck with blue cheese dressing ladled over it.  Sadly, unless I just want beer and a good game of pool, I'll never be by here again."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Stopped in because we were looking at purchasing a home in the area. Sat down at the table. Waitress came to the table behind us three times. Never would even make eye contact with us. Bathroom was horrible. One of the women's stall had no toilet paper. Waste basket was overflowing all over the floor. After 15 minutes we got up and walked out. If we purchase home we definitely not be coming back to this establishment."}
{"text":"I'm giving this rating only because the hostess, was beyond rude. My order wasn't difficult to remember. All I wanted was a WATER! The pool tables were great though."}
{"text":"This is 1 hour of my life I will never get back. Went in on Wednesday at 5pm service was terrible only had 1 beer could not get any service for a 2nd one. Sorry to my wife this was are 9th anniversary"}
{"text":"Tons of tv's and billiards tables.  Pretty cool little bar.  Happy hour beers are reasonable, $2 for a pint $3.50 for a mug.  I was scared to try any food here because of the previous reviews, so i got an order of tater tots - it's pretty hard to mess these up.  They weren't bad, and the bar is pretty cool.  I'd recommend more decorations or a theme.  If the food gets better this place could be my new local bar!"}
{"text":"We used to go to the old Tempe Skip & Jans and really liked the service and food.  First and last time in Gilbert.  Service was ever!!!!! so slow and the place was not that busy.   We saw our waitress once to get the menu, two to get our beer and order and three to get our food.  Had to ask another employee to get our check and that took forever,   This place does not want new patrons.  Save your time."}
{"text":"the only reason this place gets 2 stars is because it has booze in it (i give 2 stars for booze even if its a snack cart in a cemetery). Me and a couple of my budz rolled in here 1 time during the day and it was a super weird feeling. Dead silent except for the sound of pool balls cracking together in the distance and the occasional cough by a bar patron. We got some pool going in the back pool room and i mean......it was alright.....again the dead silence was very overwhelming. I saw some dude straight up playing music quietly on his phone while he shot pool alone just to keep his sanity. I refuse to eat food at a place that is painted light grey and has a bartender wearing a visor. Absolutely not. If I had a choice between going to this bar or mowing a guys lawn that lives in Apache Junction, go get my lawn mower."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere but the service is absolutely horrible. The waitresses were drunk or Hi on something, sorry it shouldn't take 15 minutes to put beer and ice in a bucket on a slow night."}
{"text":"I'm giving it one star for the fact we had a couple good times here w a sweet blonde waitress. The food is good, typical bar food. But the reason for the low review is because we've tried so hard to have this become our neighborhood bar- I mean we live a street away! But this is now the 3rd time we went in there and the bar top is full with regulars but the place itself is not busy. We went to sit at a table and Nobody says hi or acknowledges us even though we make eye contact and they see it. First time is was a older lady bartending, then a girl bartending and today was a guy who I've seen hangout w the owner (on nights we go play trivia).  And even though he saw us there was no hi, no coming over; anything. 10 minutes... 15 minutes (at this point we set up to play darts) and we AGAIN saw him look at us but nothing. He actually went to the back for like 5 minutes, but returned and went right to his regulars. So for the third time we left. Walked out completely. They all saw us walking out and didn't stop us or anything. I know they see us. But I'd rather go a street away to Jolie's place where the food is amazing and even though we're not regulars we're treated like one. And we go out on dates several times a week. So I think from now on we'll head to Jolie's place , but wanted the owner to see this in case it happens to people who have never been in. That's losing customers! You should Try to make new people feel welcomed and comfortable as opposed to favoring the regulars. We tip better too ;)"}
{"text":"About time they get a bartender that is easy on the eyes and has some customer service skillz. Alicia was a perfect hire... Now I won't be embarrassed to take people in!!!!"}
{"text":"This place could be good but it's not.  Huge rooms, grey walls and no style, a cold feeling.  The bar is this gigantic horseshoe with a lot of wasted space and the bartender is running from one end to the other, I am sure she is exhausted just running around the bar it is so big and only one bartender on a Friday night. I ordered the French dip, the beef was good, the bread was good but certainly not generous with the beef, very skimpy and the aujus was cold.  The only other food I saw coming out of the kitchen were chick wings.  Chick wings you can get everywhere.  From the time we ordered food until it arrived, 40 minutes.  A good bar is not easy to do, but there are several in the area that are more comfortable with very good service."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was good..went in to play an hour of pool that was 25 bucks..with.a few.drinks. would have been nice to have some Music playing"}
{"text":"It was UFC fight night and I needed an somewhere close to home to watch Ronda get her butt kicked. I heard this place had wings, and beer, and television - sounded perfect...right?  Maybe I didn't come on the right night.   There was a birthday party happening and all the waiters and waitresses seemed to be catering towards that so service was kinda slow...We were 3 fights in before our waitress greeted us...about 45 minutes? By then my friend had already walked up to the bar and ordered directly from the bartender.  We ordered wings, and as soon as they were delivered I knew I would be donating them to a homeless person. I'm going to do a comparison to Zipps right now, because Zipps knows how to do bar food. When you order wings from Zipps, it's around 6-10 big plump wings that has a smell that entices everyone in the area to order more wings. The wings here were about 25 skinny little wings with no flavor and dry as who knows what. And the smell...The lady from the table next to us scrunched up her face and asked \"is that your wings?\" They smelled awful and the odor was strong. I tried to hold onto those wings until UFC 193 was over to deliver to a homeless person but the smell from them was so strong I was advised several times to just throw them away.   I really hate to write such a bad review, so now I'll mention some positives - the televisions were great, the beer was good, and the prices were affordable. This place is so close to where I live and has some great potential to be a fantastical local bar, it just needs some help with the food."}
{"text":"Went out looking for a place to watch the GB game on Sunday, S&J's just opened recently, let's check it out. I'll give it 3 stars for now, I didn't try any food. All I could see on the menu, was fried, fried fried and of course burgers. The waitress recommended the flat bread, maybe next time. Service was slow, our waitress seemed new, didn't quite know what was behind the bar, but she was attentive after she got rolling. One thing I will say, this place is uber clean. I could drop my food on the floor, and could pick it up again, it almost sparkled, that is the main reason I'll be back to try the pool tables and food. See you soon!!"}

{"text":"Same great billiard with a new fresh look and location!  I am very impressed with the new location.  Skip and Jan's was formally located in Tempe, AZ.  They recently closed the doors of the Tempe location and opened in Gilbert, AZ.  I am not only excited that it is much closer to home for me, but it was beautifully remodeled in the process.  Skip and Jan's took the old First Round Drafts location on the Northeast corner of McQueen and Warner and gave it a major facelift. The old FRD was 100% gutted for this transformation.  The fresh paint and new bar top gives a fresh, clean, fun and welcoming feel.  They just opened their doors on Wednesday, and I have already made two visits.  It is quickly become our local hangout. Skip and Jan's offers 18 top of the line pool tables.  When I say top of the line, I mean it.  They have to have some of the best tables in the valley!  The pool hall is in a separate room from the main bar, but don't worry you'll have enough servers to still take care of your drinks and food!  I personally like the separation because you don't get the noise and the sometimes distracting people in the bar affecting your game.  The bar offers music, shuffleboard, old school sit down PacMan, pin ball and of course GOLDEN TEE! There are plenty of TVs to catch your favorite teams in both the bar and billiard!!!  A lot of the staff came from the old location with a couple of new faces.  I was told they will be getting a new menu shortly, but right now I love their tacos!!!  In fact, I love that their food is traditional bar food: hotdogs, hamburgers, tacos, cheese crisp, wraps, oh and their fries rock!!!  They are crinkle fries - The BEST!!!  If you couldn't already tell, I will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely never coming back here. This hole in the wall bar is not worth coming back to if our lives depended on it. I seriously cannot get over the attitude and saltiness coming from the bartender named Jen. She makes it so obvious she hates her life and job. I've never felt so uncomfortable ordering from an establishment in my life. This isn't your house we just walked into lady. You shouldn't be acting this way. The server in the back when my fiancée was playing pool was extremely nice compared to Jen at the bar. But it wasn't enough to make me want to come back in the future.   The food was mediocre at best. The boys were complaining about how hot the wings were since they were supposed to be \"mild\" I love spicy food so it didn't bother me spice wise but the wing itself were pretty dry and do NOT fall off the bone at all so it was kind of a struggle. The onion rings and mushrooms(according to my fiancée) liked those. The fries were decent. They gave us a \"deal\" on the pool table since we came later in the night for 10 dollars an hour rather than the normal price? My fiancée was groaning on their normal rates and she said she technically was supposed to charge us close to 100 for our group who didn't all play. Pretty absurd if you ask me. Fail and fail."}
{"text":"Solid neighborhood bar with a local neighborhood crowd. Tons of TV's, lots of space, and pool tables everywhere. One waitress for the whole bar. Karaoke was not bad. Typical bar food like onion rings and fried zucchini were ok.  Prices were decent. People kept to themselves and were pretty chill.   Overall, I would not go out of my way to come here, but it was still fun since I was in the area."}
{"text":"Great new building and beer selection. The pool tables are perfect.  The service sucks. When you are playing pool, expect to have to go up front and order your beer and food. I literally waited 45 minutes until a server acknowledged me while I was playing pool. I loved skip and jans before and I hope that this area improves or I won't be spending much time there."}
{"text":"Meh, indeed.  Drinks. They have an average beer selection. Most of the domestics and the few craft brews and foreigns that everyone else has. There was no beer menu that I could find, maybe they have one and it just wasn't readily available. I didn't see one. Perhaps try having some more local stuff. We've got a great collection of microbreweries here in the Phoenix area, leverage that to your advantage. I know they're not trying to be a beer geek place and lord knows there's enough of those already, but at least stock something from San Tan and maybe a couple more from Four Peaks. If not one of the lesser known breweries like Huss or Mother Road.  Service. The service was decent. The bartender was working her ass off even though there didn't seem to be any shortage of employees. At one point I saw one of the waitresses(?) sitting in a chair back by the entrance to the kitchen without a care in the world while her coworkers were getting slammed. What's up with that?  Ambiance. This place is sort of weird, kinda sterile, but absolutely massive. The bar is huge and there's plenty of space which I like, but there doesn't seem to be enough tables and chairs to use the space so there's a lot of empty, unused space which makes it feel like you're sort of sitting in a warehouse. The blue and battleship grey decor doesn't help in that regard. The TVs are well positioned, so this would be a good place to watch a game. Maybe think about some more TVs on the exterior walls so patrons that aren't facing the bar have something to watch too.  Food. This one is the killer, right here. I ordered two items. An appetizer of fried zucchini sticks which tasted freezer burnt and overcooked. (Pro-tip - if your food is coming out of the fryer too dark and dirty, it's time to filter or replace your oil.) I also ordered the BBQ chicken flatbread, which came out cold and was probably undercooked since the cheese wasn't fully melted.  I get that this is a divey sort of place so I'm not expecting five star gourmet food by any stretch of the imagination, but this stuff was barely eatable, and I'll eat just about anything.  I'll come back for the happy hour specials, which seem to be decent. But I definitely won't be eating anything next time."}
{"text":"We went into the \"new\" skip and Jan's... Open minded. This place was something you would expect or want to see on bar rescue. The place was so dark and shady. The service was awful! The food and drinks (beer from the tap and well drinks) super questionable!! Will never visit this establishment again!"}
{"text":"local sports bar & grill with a great food, crowd and vibe.  Plenty of TV's to watch multiple sporting events at the same time.  Wings are top notch and drink specials are probably the best in the area.  Typical bar entertainment includes karaoke, pool and shuffleboard (Beeman sucks).  It appears to be the preferred meet-up place for people living in the Islands area."}
{"text":"This is a cool sports bar lots of pool tables and people who think they can sing karaoke god help us but the drinks are good and the staff is nice so there's a happy balance."}
{"text":"All the bartenders ignored me when I went up to the bar to ask for water. It took forever with everyone awkwardly staring at me. Karaoke had a 30 person rotation tonight."}
{"text":"We got done with work pretty late and we wanted to eat and have a drink, $3 for a Stella, seriously! They were pretty busy so their kitchen was still open at 11pm! For once that we didn't have to eat fast food after work. I got the Parmesan and Garlic Wings, they were pretty good. They have a huge room with lots of pool tables in the back, so we spent our time there, it was pretty fun!"}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood and looking for a watering hole to frequent.  Walked in and went straight to the bathroom. What a mess.  Walked into the bar and sat down. I hate karaoke and the performers sounded bad but what the hell, I'll try damn near anything once. After sitting at the bar and not getting so much as a look from a bartender I got up to leave. A guy close by asked why I was leaving and offered to buy me a beer. Apparently his girlfriend is an owner. I appreciate the gesture but it was just not right for me to drink a free beer knowing that I will never be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in mid day for a couple of beers and some wings great service great food great atmosphere will be back for sure make sure you try Jan's wings"}
{"text":"So I went back and i actually had an even better experience! The food was even better, and i even order the same exact thing as last time! The waitress was super attentive. I went on a Thursday night and they had karaoke going. I noticed they have a lot of regulars, which is why there a decent amount of people every time I go. Also I came because my parents are always going, so I decided to finally try it out. Good price on happy hour and drinks! I will be coming back more often for drinks and appitizers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love it here! Food is great and staff is awesome!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.      Can't find a bar in the area with the amount of pool tables they have"}
{"text":"I wasn't going to write anything until I seen picky on my receipt. Why because I said no ice she puts ice in my drink and she said I did not hear you across the bar walking away and then I ordered a crispy chicken salad it came out not crispy her response was I did not hear you in a rude way then I asked several times for silverware because she never gave me any to eat my salad.  still waiting on my tacos that after 30 minutes that I ordered with my salad that never came out. She was also Rude like she hated her job"}
{"text":"Went in here for karaoke one night, seemed like a decent bar for what it was.  Had some friends with me also. When we ordered drinks I got mine and tasted it, and it was made very wrong, extremely sweet for a drink that's not really supposed to be. I asked the bar tender Daryn that maybe it was made wrong and she said to me \"no that's the ways it's supposed to be, don't order drinks unless you know what they are\" and she said it in a very rude manner. I've been a bartender for 7 years so I didn't feel like that was appropriate. Was very tempted to show her the recipe online, because all the recipes said the same thing, no simple added.  Maybe the manager should hire bar tenders that know why they're doing. Or at least ones that are able to accept when they messed up. Will go back in a few more times and see if how it goes just for the fun of it."}
{"text":"Okay. Much better than the place that took up 1/4 of this corner before. That said, why is there no dart boards and more games outside of pool ?  Weird with all of the space they would leave it dead vs put in something to take my quarters Keep improving options and you might stick long term."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour prices, large bar, lots of TVs to catch games.  Kareoke DJ way too loud for the space."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential and I hope  it can find its footing. We ate here on a Saturday night and started with the fried zucchini sticks and a dozen wings (half medium/half hot). We ordered this at the same time we ordered our beers and happened to receive both at the same time (roughly 15-20 min later). It would have been helpful to have a list of all the beers on draft, but that's just on a side note. The wings had great flavor and had quite a bit of meat on them, definitely would recommend trying them. I ordered the Southwest Burger medium rare and it came out well done. Still gave it a shot and found that it still had good flavor as well. The tater tots were surprisingly very good with a nice crunch to them.  Not sure if they were just really understaffed that night or if it can be chalked up to the \"newness\" of the place and as it was just a bit disorganized. The waitresses were nice but it seemed like they were having a difficult time managing all the different tables as they didn't seem to have specific assignments. These are just some of the small details that added up over the night that led to the rating, including the two small styrofoam plates received for our apps at a table of four. Our waitress even felt compelled enough to apologize to us multiple times for, in her words, \"terrible service\".   Again, as far as the size of this place, the large bar, lots of pool tables, big TV's, good draft beer selection, and decent food, I think it has a lot of potential and I would like to come back to try again."}
{"text":"Don't believe the negative reviews.  While this place is still a work in progress, it is a GREAT neighborhood bar.  The food and drinks are an excellent value for the prices, and the Chicken Wings are as good as anything in the Gilbert area.  The waitresses were also very friendly and attentive.  PS - We were there for the Cardinals - Panthers playoff game."}
{"text":"This place has pool tables for days.  Just because it's a bar don't sleep on the menu.  I had the wing which were frilled by the way and I lived them so much that I hot a order to go.  The ambience of the place is a friendly reminder of how people should be.  Lives the place!"}
