{"text":"Similar to Michelle M., really wanted to like this place. 

Should have been a red flag immediately when my wife and I were scanning the menu wondering...\"so, what exactly are they known for?\" The menu is a hodge podge of asian, seafood, meats and italian options. My \"house manhattan\" was absolutely watered down. The sweet potato gnochi was good enough, but the pork chop cooked \"medium\" was tough and dry with very little flavoring. No signs of any almonds in the almond couscous either. The server didn't even check in to see how the meal was progressing, just a quick \"can I get you another beer\" (I had a manhattan). Overall, really poor service and very mediocre food priced at a premium."}
{"text":"Thank you Colleen for making us feel welcome.  We walked in 20 minutes before closing. Colleen was very inviting and encouraged us to stay for a glass of wine. Cheers"}
{"text":"Reservation for 4, seated under a vent blowing cold air. Hostess didn't care but a server eventually helped us resolve the problem. The $42 porterhouse was tasteless with no seasoning at all. Creme Brule' was like water. The brussel sprouts were good, though."}
{"text":"A couple of disclaimers: I only ate at The Raintree once; I'm not a foodie; and I have some dietary restrictions. 
I really love the decor. It is sort of dark and cozy, yet clean, and does not feel stuffy. I love the big wall of antique wooden mirrors with lights around them, and I love the colors- like a slate blue with black trim. 
A couple of pieces of constructive criticism: the bread that was offered before the meal had a crust so tough, it was almost inedible. 
My soup (chicken/rice) was not served hot- it was warm. It was tasty and different, though. A little bit sweet, and spicy- just would have enjoyed it more if it had been hot. 
I would have really appreciated some beverage options on the menu that were non- alcoholic- sparkling waters, teas, soft drinks, coffees, etc. The only beverages listed were alcoholic. Not everyone drinks alcohol. 
I ordered the club sandwich because I needed something that was not heavy. It was good, the bread was just over-toasted. 
I would definitely go back and try some of the more interesting things on the menu- we didn't have a reservation and they were very friendly and we got a seat, etc. and I really appreciated that!"}
{"text":"Brunch today was very weak. Brunch menu was boring and uninspired for Mothers Day.  Service terrible.  Made our reservation 4 weeks ago and we were seated in bar.  Had appetizers about 2 months ago and very impressed. Today was a total letdown. Only good thing were the Bloody Marys!"}
{"text":"Great addition to our rich NEO dining scene.  The Chef puts out innovative, while utterly comforting food.  The host had grace under pressure as she solved a snafu with our reservation.  We started with pacific oysters with a perfect mignonette.  They tasted as fresh as the oysters I ate in tomales bay last month. We tried the mussels, green salad, duck confit, swordfish with angel hair, cod with celery 3 ways, & steak.  Seriously, I never knew celery could be so celebrated.  All our food was well executed and felt like home  The atmosphere was exactly what we wanted for a couples night out, but I'd also come back with well-behaved children."}
{"text":"Thrilled to see some great bartenders from Jekyll. We never visited the old Raintree - the crowd was too old for us. Love the new Grove HiIll. The vegetarian curry was amazing (great to see a vegetarian entree). There were five of us and everyone thought the food was exceptional.  Great experience. Fun evening. Location, ambiance, food  and great service at the bar will bring us back. Can see Grove Hill being one of our 'go to spots' to get us through the fall and Cleveland winter."}
{"text":"I have to say the food, drinks, and the ambiance was great. The waiter was very friendly and helpful. However, I would not come back here simply because of the rudeness the hostess. My husband and I had an early dinner and when we were seated, the hostess politely told us they have a reservation at 7 for our table. That was totally fine with us as we still had 2.5hrs to 7. We had our dinner and we were finishing our last drink, the hostess actually came to our table at 6:15pm, told us \"I'm sorry but you have to move to the bar now.\". It was not like \"would you mind moving?\" Or \"I'm sorry\". More importantly, the restaurant was only about 70% full and 45mins before 7, the time when the table was supposedly reserved. Do not think we will be back again."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. WAY overpriced for the \"eh, alright?\" food and \"meh\" service. We forget this place exists, and for good reason. 

Where? Right.

I miss Raintree"}
{"text":"I visited the restaurant with my family for brunch and was quite disappointed.  I had hoped after the restaurant changed names recently it would be brighter and remodeled.  The restaurant unfortunately did nothing to enhance the ambiance.

Although the food was fine, it was not better than the other restaurants in Chagrin. I found the service poor and the wait staff congregating while we waiting way too long for our food.   I will not return."}
{"text":"Awesome. One of my favorites when I'm in town. Tim has really turned this place around. One of the true gems of the Cleveland food scene."}
{"text":"Grove Hill is one of our favorite places. The menu is good and occasionally will feature some great specials. Bar service is always fantastic and the happy is hour is killer. Best place in town to get fresh oysters and they are half off during happy hour. They usually carry a selection of 3-4 east and west coast varieties. The pasta is always reliable as are the sandwiches and small plates. Best thing on the menu? Probably the pork chop or the steak special which varies but is usually a Delmonico (bone out ribeye) with a fried egg on top. Only complaint would be the outdated decor which is cozy but could use a little refinement. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent,  lamb was a little pricey but certainly worth it.  Our waitor, Jeremiah was fantastic."}
{"text":"Had brunch on Sunday.  Several interesting selections on the menu, the frittatas were good and different ( with pasta) and the cinnamon roll appetizer was top notch."}
{"text":"Lovely place in the former Raintree Tavern. Excellent seafood, great wine list, and good service."}
{"text":"My wife and I got together with some friends for dinner.  We wanted to try someplace that we haven't been to before, so we made reservations for dinner.  The dining experience was fantastic.  We started out with some drinks.  Our friends had the portabello mushroom soup as an appetizer, and they raved about it.  It was very creamy and full of flavor. My wife and I declined to have any appetizers.  Four our main course, my wife and friend had the short ribs which was a special. They both thought the short ribs were excellent. Our other friend had a small plate of the tuna, which she said was really good.  I had the sweet potato gnocchi which was the best I have ever had.  It doesn't get any better than that!  Our waiter was Daniel and took very good care of us throughout the evening.
We can't wait to go back there, it was a truly wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Just left with my wife to a wonderful culinary experience. Growing up in NYC, I was pleasantly surprised by the menu, wait service, and food. We had the chicken liver on toasted bread with a plum sauce. FABULOUS.  My wife had the veal Milanese and I had the lamb shank. Both excellent choices. 
The waitress, Brenna, could not of been more helpful with the selections. The food came out extremely quickly. We will definitely be back if we are near Chagrin Falls again."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere! Classy but casual. The staff there was very nice and attentive. The food was good - the Arancini was amazing! I got the Chicken Milanese, and it was good! Although based off the menu description I was expecting something different. So I was a little disappointed on that front, but the meal was still good. It was a large breaded chicken breast with the green salad on top. Would recommend and will come back when in the area!"}
{"text":"Another great meal.  Waitress, Tara,  is really nice!  Love her jewelry!  Food was good, fast service.  Good value."}
{"text":"We've chosen to go to this restaurant many times. The food is consistently superb and the service is outstanding - attentive, friendly and cheerful. We've made it a Christmas Eve tradition in our family to go to dinner at Grove Hill!"}
{"text":"Excellent sweet potato gnocchi. Happy it is served without sausage on request.  If the chef/owner wishes to attract vegetarians, and it seems very few do, say on the menu that the meal IS vegetarian, and meat can be added for an extra dollar or 2.  That would be better than having to ask if a dish can be prepared without meat.  Meanwhile, I was glad to have more than one option for a meatless meal.  Farm fresh and farm to table are nothing more than catchy phrases if vegetarians are left out."}
{"text":"I could tell you all about Grove Hill based on my first visit last night - but let's get right to the point.

I love pasta, so when we asked our waitress if there was anything the restaurant was known for, she said their Bolognese sauce.  I asked her what kind of pasta it came on and it was some standard \"tube-like\" pasta (my words, not hers).  I had remembered her saying Grove Hill made their own tagliatelle in-house, so I asked to have that subbed in.

OMG - sooooo tasty.  Yes, their Bolognese is extremely good.  It's very fine unlike some restaurants whose sauce has huge chunks of meat.  But the pasta - heavenly.  Soft, yet firm with a delicate texture and taste, just like fresh pasta should be.  The combination was amazing and I'm ashamed to admit I ate the entire bowl of the dinner portion.  

If you're a pasta and/or Bolognese nut - go there and try it.  I think you'll be happy.

Quaint little place - bar/restaurant kind of layout as mentioned.  The bar is in a back corner, so kind of separated from most of the rest of the restaurant.  While it has two fairly large monitors, the sound was down way low, so wasn't a bother.  Wait staff was very casual, but did a great job.  All in all a great little place that I will be back to often I think."}
{"text":"Based on the menu - I knew better to go there when they first came to town.  They have very odd things in their menu.  Despite that, my husband and I had dinner there for our anniversary.  His idea - not mine. We stop at the reception desk, \"name?\"  As she looks at the listing she starts to walk away and I guess we follow her.   She places the menus at a table right under a blasting speaker.   \"Can we sit elsewhere? It's kind of loud here.\"   She makes a face then picked up the menus and moves us one table.  \"Is this better? Or would you like to sit in the bar? There is a (large) party coming and will sit here.\"   Ok... as she takes us to the bar area. Already I didn't appreciate her attitude and asked her name.  (Laura) I asked if she was the manager - she said no.  She sat us at a table and walked away.  The waiter came by and I had to ask several questions about the menu.  They had no scallops - which I was relieved after reading on a former review they were salty.  I asked about the portion size of the port chops and he said they were gigantic.  I then asked about the vegan ravioli and if it could come with Alfredo sauce instead of tomato sauce.  He said he would check as he got my husband a drink.  He came back and didn't mention the Alfredo - so I opted for something safe.  A turkey burger and the butternut squash soup with coconut oil.  The soup was not hot and came with such a large spoon that looked like a small shovel.  Not very lady like but the soup was tasty.  The turkey burger came and like other reviews - the bread was over-toasted and the fries were clearly over done.  The meat itself was hot and mediocre at best but I was hungry and had to eat something. I asked for new fries and received them, but by their arrival, I was full and annoyed with the lack of enthusiasm or kindness.  Waiter seemed annoyed with me but was very kind, talkative and attentive to other tables near us.  The waiter brought the check, and did not say thank you.  He picked up the check and again, did not say thank you for coming.   The bill was quite high for a turkey burger, soup, a mixed drink, walleye from Lake Erie and a salad.  I will never return and plan to call the manager as well.  Staff needs training on customer service. Not a pleasant experience. Yours Truly would have been a better choice and a hell of a lot cheaper.  Two thumbs DOWN"}
{"text":"Very Good. It has been a long time since we were here last. It was called Rain Tree then. Not a lot has changed. Except the decor. Gone are the offer doilies. 

The service is still fantastic. Pleasant and attentive. Just the way it should be. 

The menu is a bit sparse, but there is a dish for everyone in any mood. I got the scallops. Not only a favorite of mine but I remember them here previously. And I was not disappointed. Cooked just right!

Wifey had the half baked chicken. A favorite of hers. She enjoyed it also saying it was seasoned a little different than expected but in a good way. 

All in all if you are looking for a special dinner tonight. This is the place."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in chagrin.  So happy that they are now open for lunch.   Sticky buns, chicken wings are top notch.  And best place to get oysters in chagrin!"}
{"text":"What a gem! If I lived closer Grove Hill would me my neighborhood go-to place. 

Chef/owner Tim Bando has created a place that's just right. 

I love the décor and ambiance. Without gutting the place they gave it a fresh face that's warm and cozy and a perfect fit for the area. 

The menu offers smart, modern takes on comfort foods and is eclectic but cohesive. 

I dined with three friends and every dish that hit the table was well executed and greatly enjoyed. We started with oysters. They offer a good selection of east and west coast shells and they were impeccably fresh and well chilled. My kale salad with butternut squash was a delight-  a well balanced salad, dressed perfectly. I could have that salad every day. My cod with celery root puree, sautéed celery and truffle butter was also a delight. The piece of cod was the right size portion and perfectly seasoned and cooked. The celery root puree was swoon-worthy and the truffle butter a nice way to tie it all together. One friend had the Tuesday BBQ plate special. Delicious meats and sauce. I would travel all the way across town just for the BBQ plate. Another friend had the burger which he enjoyed and we all thought the fries were great. Friend number four had the trout schnitzel with German potato salad. A fun dish and another winner. 

Our server was gracious, friendly and well versed on the menu. She was able to answer and was patient with all of our menu questions.

Beer, wine and menu prices are right on for what's being served. 

There was a folk music trio playing in the dining room on the night of our visit. What a nice treat that was. 

I'm eager for many return visits."}
{"text":"Just moved back to Ohio from DC and I've been raving to east coasters about how much better our food and service is here in Ohio. Unfortunately, the poor attitude and negativity of the bar tender makes me wonder if I were completely remiss in thinking folks in the service industry are actually friendly at all. The fried risotto was tasty and the drinks were decent. After the bar tender said \"Are you guys gonna order anything else?\" in a rude tone (he was pretty crappy the entire time), I decided I wouldn't be returning. One of the lady patrons was nice, but other than that it made me rethink visiting this place and others like it. If you don't like serving people then get out of the service industry."}
{"text":"Had dinner a few weeks ago.  Overall pretty good.  My wife had the vegan ravioli, I think they were mushroom.  Pretty tasty.  I had a curry dish, which was somewhat disappointing.  I'm used to my curries having a really full, rich flavor, and this dish was rather bland.  The salad was good.  We skipped desert to go across the street to the Popcorn Shop!  Service was decent, nothing special.  I would try it again to see if they can hit 5 stars.  Chagrin Falls is such a great place to visit..."}
{"text":"So many good things going on at Grove Hill. Decor and atmosphere is terrific, server Jim was a great part of the experience and most food at our table of six was favorably received. That all said, if you're serving up a $14 burger and fries it's got to be bit more special than a burger at Fridays and done medium rare when medium rare is requested. This burger was neither. Somebody might want to take a run over to Fire on Shaker Square to see how you do a burger (for just a buck more) justice. 
Again, server Jim was great so be assured these three stars are about the burger. Yuk."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a soccer game in the area based on other yelp ratings. I was not disappointed. I loved chicken liver as a kid (yes I am weird). Anyway  I was surprised to see that on the menu and could not pass it up. Loved it. Atmosphere was good for all comers. Had a low key bar area and a nice dining area too. If you are passing through check it out. I hope you enjoy as much we did!"}
{"text":"So I blasted the place a year ago ... But wow.  Tim Bando has it rockin ... This place is great!  Ribs with coffee bbq crazy good.  Best artichoke in town.  Tomato and Burrata excellent.  So if u read my previous review ... Forget about it!  Try it ... Plus Tim is great guy and he has listened and changed his restaurant ... Great addition to the CLE culinary scene.  Thanks Tim ... Btw they have Lagavulin ... How good is that"}
{"text":"Totally unimpressed. Stopped in en route to a theatre performance for dinner. Ordered overpriced drinks and mushy risotto balls for appetizers. Salad choices were limited so we skipped that course. We ordered the sweet potato gnocchi and the pan seared salmon hoping to share them both. While the gnocchi portion was generous, the 3 oz of burned and oily salmon for $26 was a true travesty. Extremely disappointed at the disaster called dinner, we passed on dessert. When all was said and done, $82 is the only money that place will see from us."}
{"text":"I don't ever give bad reviews, so you'll want to read this. I had a really bad anniversary dinner. Let me give you the play by play:

Walked in and the place was DEAD, and they sat us right next to the only other couple there. Unnecessary. It's a big enough place. The decor is dark and could use some updating. Had bread that was meh. Took her suggestion on the pulled pork and she said splurging for fries was worth it. Spoiler:it wasn't. Got our meals and the fries were charred, inedibly hard. Bun was burnt and meat was dry. I was sad. She passed us three times never asking how things were so I could give her a chance to fix the mistake, even though it was obvious I hadn't touched my fries or bun. Finally came to give the check and ask how dinner was and I informed her about the fries. She apologized stating she \"would have gotten me new ones\" -past tense. Well why didn't you ask before now? Or check in? She handed us the check w/no changes to make up for the fact that I left hungry. I cannot appreciate a place that doesn't try to correct their mistakes, make amends on the bill, or offer an apology item. 

Pros: the pickle was good, the roses were real, water was tasty, and bartender wished us well as we left. That's it--I tried to be positive there, give me some credit!"}
{"text":"We were excited about this place because of the location and that we are often in the Chagrin Falls area just to hang out and get popcorn. The duck confit, the barbecue rib appetizer, and the fish I had for dinner would be what I'd recommend. The scallops though were a bit too salty that night, but might have been an off night as the scallops have been well liked by other reviewers. The decor and atmosphere felt a bit tired. While the service was friendly, the wait time was on the slower side with a total dining time of 1hr 30mins."}
{"text":"A nice surprise to find this gem in the middle of Chagrin. Happy hour menu is great as well as dinner choices. Reasonably priced and efficient staff."}
{"text":"To go order:
Not sure how to rate, called Togo order in today at 6:19. Told it would be 30-40 min. Received food at 7:35. Offered free drinks while we waited but what a wait!

That being said food was 4 stars, would have given 5 but was not hot enough. 

To go boxes are awful. Need a divided container that seals to keep food warmer."}
{"text":"We went this evening. The wait staff were all friendly and attentive. Our food was great and we had a great experience. It's too bad some of the others commenting are comparing it to the former establishment.  It's a new restaurant!  I highly recommend anyone going.  Also a plus that it is family friendly."}
{"text":"Such a cute restaurant! Even though they were busy, our server was awesome and so attentive. Four of us shared their amazing mussels, and my sweet potato/corn dish was so tasty. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Grove Hill (my fifth time) last night after not visiting since last winter for no particular reason.  As usual I was not disappointed.  The food and drinks have always been superb and the service wonderful!  Unfortunately, one of my favorite dishes (the shaved brussels sprouts) is not on the menu for the summer but I was assured it will return in the fall as it is a customer favorite.  I was sad to see that it was not very busy and I really hope this establishment succeeds with the new restaurant openings (Jeckylls, M Italian) in the village.  The food at Grove Hill far exceeds that at the majority of restaurants in Cleveland (M Italian and Gamekeepers in particular have horrible food!).  After speaking with the chef on one of my visits I learned that his resume includes time at restaurants in Manhattan and the Hamptons and this experience is apparent in his thoughtful, homemade dishes.  My only advice to Grove Hill would be to consider a bit of redesign of the dining area and bathrooms.  The women's bathroom looks as though it was never renovated when GH took over the space and while the bar area has some ambiance the main dining area is quite lacking in character.  Since they are not fortunately to have an outdoor seating area, perhaps a nicer dining room would attract more diners.  Regardless, I will continue to come back again and again to enjoy the wonderful menu at Grove Hill!"}
{"text":"This was my third time there. The food was disappointing and over priced. My creme brûlée was over cooked and tasteless"}
{"text":"It's always a pleasant surprise to land on a great meal in a place you don't normally dine. We come out to this area for dinner at my inlaws, but rarely eat out here. My husband had heard of the opening and wanted to try it out, so we ventured to the burbs for date night. Ambiance: definitely the burbs. Which is fine, honestly, but as a couple in the 25-35 crowd, we were easily the youngest here (aside from kids with their parents). My husband got the burger which was good, and I had the scallops with polenta croutons which was really excellent. The scallops were cooked to perfection and I loved the polenta croutons-- my first time having those (are they a thing..?). I don't see that dish on the regular menu though so it must have been a special (hey management-- you should add this on!) if you visit when it's offered, I give the dish a full recommendation.
I can't comment on dessert since we saved ourselves for ice cream at the popcorn shop, of course.

Overall, the burbs did not disappoint- we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very loud. We where seated by the bar so conversation over dinner. The drink order took over 10 minutes to put in and then at least 15 minutes for the drinks. Bread came 10 minutes after the drinks but the oyster app came minutes later. My wife's linguini was a bit oily and my steak was done to perfection. Overall the menu did not excite us very limited with no specials."}
{"text":"We have lived in the area for 6mo now and have had our eye on this place since it's so close to the village center. We opted to make a reservation through RESO which was very convenient.

The food: 

I had the scallops which was served on top of a bed of arugula/couscous/pomegranate seeds. The dish did not flow well. 2stars

Wife had the gnocchi which was overly priced and just a mess of foods and flavors. $22 very little chorizo in the gnocchi. Surprised this is such a popular dish. 2stars

The pork buns were very tasty. Would have liked more protein, and I don't believe the buns were made in house. 4 stars

The wings were good as well. Great flavor, plenty of meat... but on 3 wings 4stars

The service: Our waiter was not welcoming nor kind. We were not greeted with a Hi, but rather what you drinking?! Very odd. He was cocky and boisterous. 

We came because of a gift card. We will not be returning. For that price the dishes are not creative enough. I'd rather spend the money somewhere that has complex menus with prices that reflect that.

This food was way to simple for the prices"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! We went for our 10 year anniversary and we loved the experience.  Good local beer and Bourbon selection.  I had the Delmonico steak special.  It melted in my mouth and was perfect.  My wife wanted the Julia Child Bouillabaisse but is not a fan of shrimp.  The waitress asked the chef/cooks if we could sub for the shrimp.  They added more clams and scallops.  The scallops were perfect and tender as well as the muscles and Clams.
Service was top notch. 
We will be back.  The decor is nice and inviting."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly, efficient service.  I chose 2 appetizers instead of an entree.  Not only did our server, Jim, recommend the appetizers, but discouraged me from ordering a salad, since my 2 appetizers would be enough.  Thanks Jim.  I wish other servers would express their opinions when asked, instead of being noncommittal.
All 4 of our party loved the food and Jim's personality.  We will return and recommend Grove Hill to our friends."}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour, stayed for dinner. We had the oysters, a gratis happy hour app buffet that included a steamed artichoke, the sausage platter, duck paprikash and two desserts (plum apple crisp and creme brûlée). It was so good I had to write a review. The duck was perfect. We sat at the bar which was very cozy."}
{"text":"pretty disappointing. have been waiting a long time for them to open since we live close by and because the chef is so well regarded. hopefully, they will work through the (many) kinks and we can return but it won't be anytime soon. On the good side: everyone was VERY friendly, you can tell that they use quality ingredients, the chicken soup was outstanding, the burger was as well. On the bad side: the staff (and this goes all the way up to the manager) was horribly trained, nobody knew anything for certain about the menu, multiple dishes were served cold, the portion size of the aforementioned excellent chicken soup was insultingly small, the grilled corn (which could have been tasty) was drenched in a cheese sauce that just overwhelmed it, several items on the menu seemed dramatically overpriced, the air conditioning was set at cryogenic, the overall menu has no direction. we had such high hopes. even spoke with the manager who made the mistake of asking how things were and he didn't really know what to say or do after that. he also didn't seem to know the menu either. too bad grove hill."}
{"text":"Grove Hill was just okay. While the veggie dishes were tasty, the main dishes and dessert, not so much. The table we were at was right next to the busy kitchen and could see right into the messy service area - truly disliked the table spot. Service was good. Wine list is not consistent with what was in stock, so that added to the just okay vibe. I wouldn't not go back because I could find something to eat there, yet it certainly is not a place I'd think of going to if asked where do I want to eat at."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this establishment last night.  Our neighborhood met here for a Christmas Happy Hour.  From the start the bartender was attentive and friendly.  We ordered several appetizers.  The short ribs were OUTSTANDING. Seriously.....some of the best I have had.  We also ordered some oysters (Blue Point) and they were also outstanding.  In the end we were approached frequently for refills and bread.  The drinks were very good and the ambiance was wonderful.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Perfect!  We dined there, last evening, for happy hour.  The food was delicious and the bar atmosphere was great.  It's the perfect blend of quality ingredients, precisely prepared, with a warm and cozy atmosphere.  We decided to come back this evening, for dinner.  Everyone loved their meal!  Well done!  We think we have a new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Love the $5 happy hour menu, everything is crazy good. The cauliflower is always a must.  The bartender, Mick, is the best in the biz!"}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday night with a few friends and the husband for dinner.  I was pleasantly surprised.  They have a decent beer list and good cocktails.   We started out with a selection of oysters which were very good.  I had 2 of the small orders of the vegetable curry and the mushroom ravioli.  They obviously don't go together, but I couldn't decide.  Both were very good, but the curry was awesome.  I like that they have small portions.  The small portion of the curry would have actually been enough, but the small ravioli was quite small.  My husband got a small order of a meat pasta which was definitely big enough for a full meal.  The service was a bit slow, but it was a busy evening.  Everyone was very friendly and accommodating.  The atmosphere was nice.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Another chagrin restaurant where the owner has given up. Poor service and bad food. 

While there was more staff than customers, the waiter was a ghost.   Raw oysters were good - the rest (steak frozen, risotto balls frozen, pulled pork bland) was way below average. 

This place has been on the line of below average and a no go for a while. It is now officially a no go - so bummed..."}
{"text":"Come here for happy hour! $2 domestic, 1/2 off oysters, appetizers $5! Excellent food!"}
{"text":"I know I know. Why tell other people to not go somewhere and just end up back there again yourself?! I'm a silly silly anomaly. I thought brunch would be different.... ALAS, IT WAS NOT. I just don't even know where to start... The forgotten order? The questionable flavors? The incomplete menu? The cost not reflecting the quality? But I think my grandpa, who I went with, summed the experience up nicely at the end when he wisely quoted Thumper from Bambi: \"If you can't say something nice, don't say nothin' at all\"."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been to Grove Hill once before, several months ago. It has gone down hill fast. The restaurant was packed the first time we were here, and it was half empty the second time around. People
Must be catching on. We had a double date last night, and were very disappointed. First off, our waiter was not friendly or accommodating at all. It seemed like the bigger tables were more worthy of his attention. Either way, I can't remember a less personable server. He barely acknowledged us all evening. 

Perhaps more importantly, the food was not good. We started with a steamed artichoke, with was fine but definitely not worth $12. It came with a mayo sauce in the side that was underwhelming. Dinner was Grove Hill's chance to redeem itself - it fell flat. I had seared salmon with rice and beets, and a horseradish sauce on the side.
The salmon ($23) was fine, but the beets and rice were literally served below room temperature, and the flavors were just boring. I love horseradish, yet I found this oniony, watery version inedible. 

My wife ordered the special, seared swordfish ($24) over a corn medley and a fruity sauce on the side. Again, the fish was fine, but she also considered the corn inedible. The sauce was very ordinary as well. After tip, dinner cost us $80, and the entire experience was negative. We will not be back - there are too many options in Chagrin Falls to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The food and service were both spot on.

They had a nice selection of oysters, and the ones we selected were delicious.  We split a few small plates- venison, arancini, and brussel sprouts.  All were cooked so well and tasted delicious.  

The host and our server were both so friendly and affable.  To have the experience we did after we popped in on a Friday night without a reservation, makes the place a real gem and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always a dependable choice for friendly service and great food!! Thai Shrimp Curry is unexpected here and well worth ordering- but everything Grove Hill features is solid."}
{"text":"Grove Hill is a fabulous restaurant in the heart of Chagrin Falls.  The food is creative and homemade.  The menu changes seasonally, but the short rib goulash on the winter menu is unreal and the bolognese is ridiculously good.  They recently opened for lunch and introduced a bunch of lower-priced sandwich options, including a pulled pork sandwich and roasted chicken sandwich, both of which are really good.  The service and atmosphere in Grove Hill are outstanding.  This is a 5-star restaurant."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try a new restaurant today and since moving out to Chagrin Falls area, we have been asked multiple times if we have been to Grove Hill. Well, we can officially say we have. 

We walked in and the hostess was there to greet us. She was very pleanst and we ended up having a little conversation which was a great welcome. 

We decided to sit in the bar area and we are so happy we did. We had a wonderful waitress and I wish I caught her name but unfortunately we didn't. She knew absolutely every detail on the menu and was very attentive. Even when we asked a question on how to say a certain word, we all joked because no one had any idea. Even some people at the bar got involved and we all had a great laugh about it. It made us realize this is a great place where everyone is just comfortable and able to be themselves.

Then, we had our food. Oh. My. Golly. We started off with the Chinese Steamed Buns that contained pork belly and pickled vegetables. It was the perfect size to split because it came with two. We took one bite and just starred at each other. What did we just eat. It was so full of flavor but then the veggies still had great texture and the steamed bun was like a marshmallow but in the best possible way.

Then for our main dishes, I had the vegetable curry and it was so delicious! Tons of the flavor and cooked perfectly so that the veggies still had some crunch. Definitely had lots of leftovers but I am totally okay with that because I am going to have the best lunch at work tomorrow. My fiancé had the Sweet Potato Gnocchi with chorizo. I have never heard him speechless. \"Wow\"...\"I Mean, Wow\". Even two hours later he is still talking about, saying it is the best gnocchi he's ever had (and trust me, he's had a lot). 

We cannot wait to come back to experience more of what they have to offer such as the half roasted chicken and the vegan ravioli. We will be back and hope to become regulars as fast as possible!

Thank you Grove Hill for the great service and the amazing food!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour was a great time to sample some terrific small plates and enjoy some well priced libations.  Tim is always a fantastic host!"}
{"text":"i really wanted to like this place more than i did. i had been reading the yelp reviews and scanning the menu and thought it would be the perfect place for a saturday night dinner. one of the best parts about the place is the parking being so close. 

we walked in and the hostess literally just stared at us. i thought maybe she was in the middle of having a stroke but no she just hasn't adopted proper social skills yet, which is the perfect type of person to hire as the hostess of your restaurant. she sat us at our table and we shortly met our waiter, who i believe was named Jim but he said or Ted...? he IDed us for our cocktails which made me and my fiancé feel awkward as we're almost 30 and he has a giant beard and a few grey hairs. whatever i guess. i had the shrub daisy and my fiancé had a bourbon cocktail and both were possibly the best cocktails we've ever had. we finished almost our entire drinks before our waiter came back, not because of how great they were, because of how inattentive the service was. finally we got around to ordering oysters, and then he left. we wanted to order more appetizers, but had to wait another 15 minutes to do so. i'm going to try and give the service the benefit of the doubt by saying maybe they were understaffed but the place wasn't even full. 

finally we get the oysters and my fiancé is in the restroom. he asks me what kind they are since they were \"chefs selection\". i had no answer for him because i wasn't told what ANY of them were. as an appetizer i ordered the charred octopus and my fiancé ordered the arancini (which our waiter repeated back to us \"air-an-seeni\"... if you're going to serve italian dishes it would behove of the staff to learn the proper pronunciation). here is where i made a mistake. i didn't inform our waiter of my dairy and egg allergy because nothing on the dish was assumed by me to include dairy or egg. when it came out it clearly did, in the celery root purée. i asked the waiter if there was dairy and egg in it and he said \"yeah probably. you're just going to have to eat around it\". LOL. OK! i quickly tell him that no, i won't be \"eating around it\" unless he would like to administer an epi pen for me. i tell him about the allergies and order the mussels. those finally come out and clearly contain a butter broth to which i'm told they don't. then he comes back and apologizes that it does. at this point i don't even want an appetizer but the mussels came out anyways in about 10 minutes, they were definitely excellent. as the waiter dropped the mussels off, he says \"i'm going to get your drinks!\" (which we had ordered about 12 minutes prior). my fiancé was under the impression that he was trying to do us a favor by taking care of our drinks since he made a mistake with the mussels, but that wasn't the case. like another yelper stated, this place obviously can't be bothered with trying to make up for their mistakes on the bill. 

for our entrees, i had the vegan ravioli and he had the veal liver. the ravioli was okay. it would have been a lot better if they used garlic and oil instead of marinara. the marinara has no flavor and since there no meat in the dish it makes the entire thing flavorless. my fiancé didn't like his liver however it was just an acquired taste. again, we hardly saw our waiter once during the time we were eating. usually the waiter or waitress checks in on you and asks how everything is. not the case, several times we had to flag him down. he looked to be in a frantic state most of the night which made us both feel awkward and uncomfortable. 

id also like to mention that while we were ordering our entrees my fiancé asked about the size of the liver and he pointed to the table behind us to show us for reference since one of the patrons just got his. during this time, a woman at the table called our waiter over, while in the middle of taking our order, and started ordering more food. not only did our waiter say \"hold on\" to us, he went over, took the old ladies order, THEN went into the back to place it while me and my fiancé were sitting with our thumbs in our asses. i couldn't believe my eyes. 

i forgot to mention the decor, which is because it's horrible. it's dark and extremely outdated. this is not the way a farm to table restaurant looks. it looks like the decor you would see on kitchen nightmares before gordon ramsey gives it a makeover. the large mirrors in the back are probably the only redeeming characteristic. 

all in all i can't say we would ever come back for food. it wasn't good enough to outweigh the extremely poor service. i've heard the happy hour is pretty good though so maybe we will try that. for reference; my fiancé is from NYC and i lived there for two years and neither of us have ever had such rude service as thing. not worth the $170."}
{"text":"The food at Grove Hill is both overpriced and overrated. Our meal started by perusing the wine and beer menu. The waiter made a heavy sigh when I just asked to just have water. Beer is overpriced with cheap domestics costing over $5. They delivered a lot of bread to our table that looked great, but was not warmed at all. A Caesar Salad will run you about $10 here and be warned, the serving is very small. You would hope for $10 they could pack a salad full of the cheap stuff like Romaine lettuce and stale bread. I also ordered the Spaghetti Squash for $9. Another person at the table had it as an appetizer and theirs was hot and properly seasoned. Mine came out lukewarm and bland. Overall the entire meal was very disappointing. OVERPRICED, SMALL PORTIONS, BLAND. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great! Haven't been to a nice night out in Chagrin Falls in a very long time. GH was a pleasure. Meal was excellent, and so was the service."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed.  We shared four of the small plates and got two desserts and really enjoyed everything.  Service was great too.  We will definitely be back!  We got the salmon tartar and the venison tenderloin - both were good.  Also got the Brussel sprouts and Arancini - I didn't love the Brussel sprouts they tasted a little smokey but the sauce with the Arancini was wonderful."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Much over rated. Only one visit.  The bar menu may be better.  Not sure what the hype is.
I had the Roti chicken that is often mentioned.  Not in the top 20 I have had. Chef needs to go to France to learn how to do a Poulet.  My wife was
\" to be polite\" indifferent to her fish entree.
At least Raintree had a vibe."}
{"text":"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! Cannot say enough good things about this gem! Food was fabulous, service was impeccable (thanks Jim/Sherman), ambiance is cozy. So happy to have experienced a lovely evening at this restaurant. We got oysters, Chinese steam buns, salmon, sweet potato gnocchi, pork chop, chocolate mousse, and tiramisu."}
{"text":"Restaurant was near-empty and easy, and the table service was good, but the food, not so much."}
{"text":"Our appetizer was great (lamb meatballs), our entrees were great (sweet potato gnocchi and seared ahi tuna), our drinks were great (spicy paloma, sazerac), and the service was great. In summary, this place is great!"}
{"text":"What a nice place and experience. We stopped in during the blossom festival. I have dietary restrictions due to have advanced PKD the bartenders, the male bartender was Mick who primarily took care of us, both were so understanding and chef accommodated. I ordered the vegan ravioli with white sauce and it was epic! My bf ordered the pork chop and said it was cooked perfect best he has ever had. The service was wonderful and live music started midway through our meal and it was so pleasant!! I really couldn't have been more satisfied. It seemed to have a lot of regulars the bartenders knew everyone. Definitely a place I will frequent when we head to the falls."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Call it getting our hopes up, or too high expectations. First, they \" change the menu often\". So the menu on Yelp we were excited about had ZERO holdovers to current menu. No poutine. Nothing. 
The Pork Belly Steamed Buns were ok at best. I had the Perch Fry. Perch was good, fries good, but slaw inedible. It was cabbage and very very little dressing. My wife's first two menu choices were out. So she got to small plates. The Brussels Sprouts looked nothing like the photo on yelp and were VERY blah. The plate was much smaller than anticipated. Her Lamb Meatballs were fine. 

For price and rating, expected much better. Better values in the area."}
{"text":"It's cozy.  Like the band choices on Friday night.  Good food, great waitresses!"}
{"text":"Great addition to Chagrin. Located in parking lot facing old Giant Eagle (good riddance) and upcoming new Heinens. 
Extremely creative menu. Comfy if dressed or jeans. Kids ok but few around. Bar area separate and beautiful and classy. Most of the wait staff has worked with chef/owner before, so very attentive but not overwhelming (perfect). 
Small plates and large plates, all easy to share. 
Loved roasted cauliflower. Salmon tartare. Lake Erie walleye. A fries with gravy concoction apparently popular in Montreal. Chef stopped by table (Tim) and spoke at length about menu development and praised his staff. Very engaging. Was told by another diner there may be rooftop patio next year. 
Passed on dessert to stroll lovely Chagrin and get cone at Jeni's, then decaf at Starbux. Great romantic evening."}
{"text":"Our server, Jim, was wonderfully attentive for our party of 14. We are the Second Saturday dinner club that chooses a new restaurant each month. I loved the Sirloin and the Gnocchi to start. The steak was cooked perfectly. Easily worth the trip to visit this great place. #secondsaturday"}
{"text":"Time for a little journey to one of our favorite areas, and try a new spot. Located in the location of the former Raintree Restaurant, Grove Hill comes highly recommended.  Not only that but Chef Tim Bando's Dad and I went to high school together, albeit a few years apart, so the pressure was on! And the pressure was nothing! 

Got reservations and got seated right on time (big plus in my book) and on a busy, packed Saturday night. 

Server was perfect! Gave us the necessary time to digest the days specials, as well as the menu. Ah, the menu!

I've heard about the various plates, both big and small, but settled for two small plates for each of us. My wife had the duck and Brussels sprouts as dinner, while I settled for the spicy lamb meatballs and the roasted polenta. All we both could say was WOW! Tasty, served hot, and delicious! The wait for the meals was nothing to worry about, especially on a busy Saturday night.

So, when in the mood for a change of pace, take the trip out to the Falls and be sure Grove Hill is in your itinerary!"}
{"text":"We used to like this restaurant but the food and service have gone downhill significantly. Gave it two more tries after a recent bad experience but continued to be disappointed. We most recently came for Easter brunch and the food was... not appetizing... at all. When we recently came for dinner, the waiter gave my husband a different entree from what he ordered but it took almost twenty minutes to flag him down. By then everyone else had eaten so he just decided to skip dinner. Anyway, sad to say we won't be back again."}
{"text":"A go to restaurant for my wife and I in Chagrin Falls.  Consistently good service and food quality.  I think we have tried a substantial portion of the menu, and have satisfied with every selection."}
{"text":"17 dinner guests at a large table. Big Jim was an excellent waiter. Nice menu. Although a bit pricy, the food was all right. Comments were \"ok\" about the ribs and oysters on the half shell. The rainbow trout schnitzel was very good. My meal of Tuscan kale salad and duck confit paprikash (I wasn't served the spaetzle, I just realized), was very good. The room was very loud, and then we heard a piano which added to the noise. I liked the decor. This is a new establishment in an older building. Give Grove Hill a try. They have Saturday and Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"This is a very, very good restaurant, and, reading the negative reviews on Yelp, I frankly don't believe they are legitimate. If this restaurant opened in my restaurant's town, I'd hire shills to diss it, too.

I can find no fault with Grove Hill. Decor, service, menu: all are superb. Moreover, the prices are extremely low for the quality you receive. I have eaten there twice now: once with a small party and just recently with a large party. The food and service have been consistently excellent.

The menu is very exciting because it is original and very au courant. It's the new American cooking at its finest, with an emphasis on fresh seafood. The small plate mussels are the best I've ever had. And I have been spoiled by some excellent mussels in the past. My straitlaced uncle enjoyed his steak and fries the other night, and my wife and I loved our Julia Child-inspired fish soup. My brother in law loved his curry dish and said it was the best he'd ever tasted. That is a wide range of excellence, people.

This restaurant might be worth a three star rating from Michelin. Time will tell. Right now it's a tremendous diamond in the rough on the east side of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great menu, with the perfect variety of choices. Something for everyone!

You can tell that the chef has a lot of experience. Every time I have been there it has been fabulous.

Try to make it there on Thursdays for the chicken pot pie!

It can get a little noisy, but it has a comfortable casual vibe."}
{"text":"We arrived last night at 5:20 for a celebration dinner and were seated in an empty dining room excluding a 2-top in a table next to the kitchen/bread cutting station where employees were chatting loudly. We asked to be moved to the bar area where there were 4 open tables. The host refused claiming that there were many reservations. This is poor hospitality and plain rude, we suspect that they did not want to seat a toddler in the bar section. Disappointing because we were looking forward to an expensive celebration dinner. Given how rude we were treated, we took our business elsewhere. This is not hospitality. You accommodate your guests and adjust particularly if restaurant is not busy. Disappointing experience."}
