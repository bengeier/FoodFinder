{"text":"Truly a hidden gem! The food is fantastic because the head chef Chris is incredibly intuitive and creative. The pie is to die for. The staff is unparalleled. Try the Mofongo and ask Steve how to pronounce it. A great place for ladies night, or date night. The bartenders are super fun. You can't go wrong... ever!"}
{"text":"Owner is super cool. Our waiter was awesome too. The vibe and ambience is really neat. Great music. The food was good. My pork dish was cold so I couldn't dig it. But the eggs in a basket was deeelish!  The Bloody Mary was out of this world and full of celery asparagus pickle and a lime! The bottomless mimosa was good for my tracker partner who can't day drink and got buzzed off three mimosas.    If you're in AZ and want to chill at a cool spot w good food go here for dinner. They have awesome food and won the culinary food award in the fashion and food contest on Friday April 10."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I shared there apps and indulged in Manhattan cocktails and red wine. The vibe is casual with a mix of friends and dates all dining together. The bone marrow is on pair, I loved it. Get plates to share, sit outside and drink."}
{"text":"I usually don't do reviews but this place is great. Different from the Scottsdale places. The menu is unique and the service is AWSEOME!!! Will return over and over."}
{"text":"After some short deliberation I've decided to set some new review rules for myself to go along with my new yelp account. (Experience and foresight encouraged me to drop my previous account when I stopped hooking up with my boss who had signed off on way too many unsanctioned expensed dinners that I'm sure her boss wouldn't have approved but I was daft enough to write about) Forging ahead I will rate restaurants for the city they are in. It never felt level to give a great spot in Eugene Oregon 3 stars simply because it wouldn't be 5 stars in LA.  Ok disclaimer made!  I tagged along with Yogi Barbarella to see her sisters new yoga studio in Scottsdale AZ. We slid in to join her class just in time. Big Sis didn't like that. Yogi B and I have form that makes Big Sis look like a lumberjack. She didn't like that either. Afterwards she pointed out her distaste for my ink most specifically the Dali on my neck. At this point I felt it prudent to let them have sister time so I bounced. Bummed around Scottsdale Old town scene, bought a gift certificate to a tattoo parlor to give Big Sis as a thank you for her charm and hospitality and started to get hungry. (Thanks for baring with me. The food review is about to start) I stumbled upon The Upton. I'm not sure what entranced me first. The delicious aroma or the roaring fire and candlelit Moroccan bizarre peaking out through the lush trellis. Either way I wondered in to a hip, art clad meets graffiti tagged restaurant and patio adorned with humble chandeliers and retro art pop houndstooth chairs. I don't remember the name of the refreshing cucumber, mint, gin cocktails that I was swilling down but they hit the spot. Since I was pissed at Yogi B by way of Big Sis' inexcusable breach of etiquette I decide to stop pretending to be vegetarian for this meal. Homeboy went balls out. Mussels, foie gras bone marrow, confit duck wings, fried oysters, sous vide steak and a big Ol slice of pie. All delicious. deeeeelicious. The only bad part of the meal was that while I sat there eating like I'd never seen food before in board shorts and Lanvin flops a huge party of beautiful babies frolicked in dressed to the nines and congregated. It quickly became clear that not all Scottsdale girls dislike sculpted tatted up Cali boys as much as Big Sis does even when said guy is slurping pate out of a marrow bone. Thanks ladies. Okay so go to The Upton if you enjoy slick understated atmosphere, solid service, delicious maneuverable menu, great vibe and tasty eye candy. And if you want the opposite of those things go to Big Sis' tired yoga studio."}
{"text":"Maybe we went on a bad night or something but the food was ok (just don't order the Havana), however the service was unexplainably bad. The appetizer came out right away, food came out not too long after, but no one ever came back by to check and see how things were, or if we needed anything. Not good but not too bad so far, but when we were done and ready for the check we sat for about 20-30minutes simply just waiting for someone to come by so we could pay. I'd get it if they seemed really busy, but they didn't. And all 4 of us are sitting at a table with all the food gone, and plates empty (minus the Havana meals) and NOBODY would come by our table so we could pay. Then for whatever reason it took about another 10minutes for them to simply charge our cards and bring them back. Staff was super friendly and we all wanted to like the place, but I can't imagine choosing to go back. Definitely disappointed."}
{"text":"My friend & I had dinner last night at The Upton and it was such a TOP-NOTCH experience! We were running late, so I jumped their website to change time of our reservation. I received a quick response accommodating our needs. When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by one of the owners, Sean. Our waiter, Steve, was very knowledgable about all items on the menu & helpful in deciding on our choices. My friend enjoyed the refreshing flavors of her drink, The Uptown Girl! The overall service was phenomenal! We met the other owner, Bran, who came over to check on our table. My friend commented on how the Chinese Char Siu ribs were the best ribs she has ever had! Bran enlightened us on how the talented Chef Chris prepares these delicious ribs, that you cannot stop eating until the last piece of meat is off the bone! Steve suggested the Veggie Cous Cous with topping it w/salmon, which was the perfect choice for me! My friend had the Cornish hen with hand-cut fries. We were celebrating my friend's birthday, so the owners brought her complimentary Snickers ice cream, which was light & fluffy along with 2 flutes of champagne to top off our sensational night on this quaint, lovely patio! Thank you Sean, Bran, Steve & Chef Chris for a beyond amazing dining experience! I will recommend The Upton to everyone I know:)"}
{"text":"Third trip to the Upton. Every experience has  been very positive.  Great food, service, and atmosphere.  Highly recommend it. Most of the seating is outdoors which is perfect for this time of year.  It'll be interesting to see what adjustments are made when the summer temperature makes sitting outside uncomfortable.  I'm sure they'll figure something out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Perfect date place. Quinn  was a great server and was so helpful! She stopped at nothing to make sure we were happy!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Came in late. And totally accommodated large party.  The food is excellent! Drinks Excellent? And service...  Patio area in back is cool... Try it"}
{"text":"Love this place. On a yelping kick tonight so I figured I'd show some love to one of my favorite spots in town. Very metropolitan vibe, great food and drinks, awesome service. All menu items under $20 and the portions are more than satisfying. A true gem in an area of town with many many imposters. HIGHLY recommended"}
{"text":"The Upton has a very nice ambiance, especially the patio.  I highly recommend the fried chicken with honey.  I literally had dreams about this meal.  The duck wing appetizer was tender and moist but lacked seasoning.  However, the ranch dressing more than made up for it.  I would recommend the Upton to anyone local or visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Omg! I love this place. It's one of my boyfriend and my favorite dinner date place. Food is amazing and service it great. We usually sit at the bar and the bartender is great. And I also love this one colorful lama painting they have behind the bar. It's beautiful!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is spectacular!  I was in town from San Francisco and happened to catch this a few days after opening.  I wasn't expecting SF-quality high end food but I loved it!  All the cuisine was top notch, innovative and delicious.  We had a party of 6 so got to try a lot of options.  The Sous Vide steak in particular was amazing.    The decor is also great - back patio as others have mentioned is wonderful and interior is stylish.  This place has great food & cocktails at reasonable prices.  And the staff was wonderful.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If your staff/kitchen cannot keep up, don't add more seating for \"the big game\".  40 minutes to get drinks, over an hour to get mediocre food (duck wings were dry/tough and fried chicken was greasy and tasteless), didn't get our wine until we were done eating, and didn't get water refills until after our check arrived."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews on yelp but the upton stood out during our meal tonight. Not only was the food amazing (the Chinese ribs were as good as they describe them) but their service was top notch. The waiters knew everything about the drinks and the menu and were very attentive. We were sitting out on their awesome patio when the dust storm hit and it hit the patio pretty hard. They went above and beyond to make it up to everyone for something that they had no control over. Everything we tried was great - Chinese ribs, pork tacos, shishito peppers, sous vide steak, and 2 of their signature cocktails. Also their happy hour menu is a steal! I am a harsh critic and I was very impressed by this place. Will definitely be back to try even more of the menu!"}
{"text":"If I'm going to spend $10-12 on a cocktail, this is one of 2 places I'll do it. (The other is Second Story.) These guys know their stuff and you can tell based on their limited and selective liquor selection. Their food menu is also really interesting (and good!!) for Old Town. Oh, and they do an awesome weekday lunch special."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  I cannot say enough about this gem. The food is amazing. Great prices for the quality. I've been for lunch and brunch. Can't wait to try the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at the Upton to celebrate my birthday with a few friends during the week. We booked last minute on a whim because of the buzz I had heard about it.  Our server was very passionate about the menu (almost too passionate, I felt like he came to our table every three minutes to suggest something new). I however was not that fond of the menu, a very limited selection. Maybe I just like my options. I did like the ribs, but I was not so fond of my Brie grilled cheese. The wine was good though.  It was worth the okay-ish food for the super awesome atmosphere though, their patio is to die for. It was beautifully decorated and lit. I will definitely be back for evening drinks this summer!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I felt like my experience here called for one. My husband and I were really excited to try this place for brunch on New Year's Day, but we left feeling completely disappointed and unsatisfied, if not somewhat disgusted. I will say that the cocktails and crispy confit duck wings were delicious. However, the chicken fried chicken sandwich and pork tostada, the two reasons we selected this restaurant in the first place, were awful. The chicken fried chicken was anything but. What was served instead was mushy dark meat chicken formed together in a patty like mold, breaded and lightly fried. The texture was so off putting and impossible to eat as a \"sandwich\". It was like fried chicken tartare slapped on an English muffin. Even worse was the pork tostada. The pork was drenched in liquid smoke. The taste was so artificial and it lingered in my mouth for close to an hour after we left. We had to go to another restaurant for a drink to wash the taste from our mouths.   I understand this is a new restaurant and they are still working out the kinks. Their menu is very promising but the recipes  need some major work. And unfortunately, though their dinner menu sounds fabulous, after this terrible experience, we won't likely be back to try it.   Sadly, not a good way to start 2015."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on Fathers Day, everything was wonderful! The staff was amazing and so friendly! My favorite the Strawberry toast!! So good!"}
{"text":"I am always wanting to try something different in Old Town.  I see the Upton everyday, but had never gone in despite the fact I work in the building right next door.  The fact that you can't really see inside too well from the front always intrigued me because it's pretty much hidden off from any regular main Scottsdale rd. traffic.  The inside was a very nice and quaint bar, but it seemed like there was a lot more to it towards the back.    We started off with the fried oysters as well as the crispy duck wings.  I had never really been to a place that served duck wings so that was a pleasant surprise.  They both come with the house chipotle ranch which was very delicious.  The oysters were lightly battered and crispy which was very nice and the duck was well seasoned and very flavorful.  I would have to say the duck was probably my favorite thing that we had.  I then had NYC which was the turkey pastrami on Marble rye and the lady had the pork tacos.  Watch out for the Pastrami b/c (all dirty jokes aside) it's a squirter.  I bit into my sandwich and the first 2 bites there was a small puddle of russian dressing on my plate with the ensuing bite on my hands.  That being sad i'm just glad I didn't get it on my clothes, but usually the best sandwiches are the messiest ones.  It's hard to beat marble rye so can't really complain there.  The pork tacos were a little underwhelming in flavor, nothing really seemed to pop out, but i do like cotija cheese so that's a nice move.  Last but not least, we had the chimmichurri cauliflower which is the \"cool\" veggie to do things with and it was on point.  I definitely would go back, the only thing I was a little displeased with was the poor service.  We definitely saw our waiter maybe....3-4x the whole night and considering how small the place is I feel that is significant.  Easily we saw several members of the same staff twice as much and often times had to ask them for extra drinks or water what have you.  That's really my only gripe.  Oh!  For the pies de resistance they have a nice handful of bourbons and they also have mezcal on their menu so that gets some brownie points from me.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is so laid back and just a wonderful environment in general. Greeted promptly and taken to a table outside. Their menu is small yet has so many choices. I choose the salmon and kale salad and it was pretty big and I could not eat all of it. I never knew this place was here as it is sort of hidden off to the side of Scottsdale Road. After dinner the canal and shopping is right there to go to so it is actually in a great spot. I would say a dinner for two would be about $40-$60 with drinks and appetizer. OH, their fries are AMAZING."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. I will never return nor will I recommend anyone to go. The staff was so uninformed and had very little knowledge of the food and beverage industry. The bartender had no idea what a French martini was and made me something that tasted like a Moscow Mule in a martini glass. The server was overly attentive to the Point where he came to the table every five minutes during happy hour asking us if we wanted refills or more to eat. I appreciate the attention but not to the point where he has no intuition or ability to read the customer. The bartender was also very snippy and acted arrogant when describing why they didn't carry various vodka brands. As far as aesthetics go, the place is so cheaply renovated it when it actually didn't need renovated at all. Petite Maison was quaint and simple and now it just looks cheap and plastic and very \"faux organic trendy\". I ordered the mussles which were actually decent in taste but the overall service and appeal along with the poor aesthetics trump everything and we will not be back. It was also very overpriced for what we got, especially for a happy hour"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow tonight. Bad night for the kitchen and for the waiter. On recommendation of the waiter 2 of us ordered the special fried chicken. Waited forever for the entrees which when they finally arrived were not hot, at best luke warm.  Because we waited so long we did not have time to send them back. There were no legs which they brought later which were under cooked and greasy. They were hot though, but inedible because they were pink inside. Another ordered salmon and specifically asked for it to be well done. It was pink. A horrible experience and will never return.  We complained to the waiter and a manager came by to apologize. We really should have refused to pay for any of the meals especially since in the waiters intro he said if it is not good they would not charge us. Since we were in an extreme rush we could not push the issue. The restaurant did not charge for one of the chickens which we did return.  I plan to call tomorrow to ask for a full refund for the other 3 entrees.  Oh, and I did not taste any honey on the barely warm fried chicken."}
{"text":"Found this place through the reviews and it was fantastic.  Appetizers (marrow, char siu ribs, duck confit) were great.  Steak and country chicken also on point, but veggie ramen could use some mushroom broth or something.  Nonetheless, they were great for our group (including a small child that they were very gracious to, but again, she was well-behaved.)"}
{"text":"Super cute decor, good service, a lot of outdoor seating, but the food did not meet our expectations. The Phoenix cocktail (bloody margarita) was delicious as was the orange juice I ordered :) but the pork tostadas that the boyfriend got and the angus beef hash were just missing something. I was tempted to ask for ketchup or salt to add more flavor to my dish. If we ever do visit Scottsdale again, would love to come back and try the lunch/dinner menu."}
{"text":"This place has a nice quaint atmosphere (can't seat a party bigger than 6 inside) but outside is very big and spacious and beautiful with some fun wall art. There are also a ton of space heaters and heaters under your seat if you are ever concerned about the cold during winter.  For food, I definitely recommend the fried chicken!!! It was delicious and fell off the bone. 2nd favorite was the pastrami sandwich. For sides the cauliflower was delicious. Nom nom...I went with a party of 6 and we ate every plate clean.   I hear the brunch is great...can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went to the Upton for brunch this past Sunday.  The food was great, the prices were reasonable and the service was excellent. The outside sitting area was comfortable. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Our foodie club of six had an incredible dinner in front of the fireplace on the patio.   Our server Brandon, was very knowledgeable about the dishes and recommended the Chinese char ribs, and crispy duck wings for appetizers... AAAAmazing!  The Angus bistro steak with caramelized sweet onions was delectable and tender as  buttah.   My husband and I so enjoyed dinner, that we decided to check out the Sunday brunch... they offer a simple menu with some unusual twists... the open-faced Havana, roasted pork, ham, Swiss with house made Dijon was divine.  Next time will try the organic egg in a basket.... oh yes there will be a next time."}
{"text":"We had a friendly and knowledge server. The crispy chicken was delicious and very moist.  The Mason Jar salad was tasty and garlic fries were fresh cut and a nice side addition. Back patio was comfortable and relaxing.  You wouldn't know you were in the middle of Old Town."}
{"text":"Dont waste your time Seating not good Service ok Food ok Not worth the visit Music bad"}
{"text":"Took a friend there today for lunch.  We dined indoors and the ambiance was great, kind of felt like an old pub in Europe.  Service was good and prompt.  Prices aren't bad for lunch.  Food didn't live up to what I had expected.  I had read so many great reviews on yelp, various blogs, so I was excited to try their menu.  My friend had the steak with salad and I had the special Phoenix sandwich.  The Phoenix is a pork belly sandwich on a bun.  I should've expected it, but it was oh so fatty and we've both had pork belly before so we knew about the fat content, but thank goodness for the bun soaking up some of that!  The steak didn't have much taste to it and was a small portion but I guess was appropriate for lunch.  The menu was also pretty sparse but I'm assuming that's just their lunch menu because I had read about other items that diners have reviewed that weren't on the menu today.  Overall it was a pleasant experience but I was disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"What can I say, I gave this place a chance twice and it was horrible twice. I had their mussels the second time (I know smart right) and got really sick."}
{"text":"I like this place. Small but comfortable. My colleagues and I went there for a quick lunch. They have a power lunch menu which has a balanced selection of items. Power lunch suggests quick preparation and delivery to your table . . . They did a nice job!!  I ordered the bistro steak over a salad . . . Flavors were amazing and I absolutely loved the raspberry vinegarette. My colleagues ordered a kale salad with a side of salmon and seemed very happy with their choice. One of our colleagues is a \"meat and potatoes\" kind of guy and ordered a sandwich that he did not eat. The server quickly came over and asked him if everything was ok. He also asked if he could get him something else. The sandwich looked amazing, but our colleague is a very finicky eater. The server removed the sandwich from the bill. I loved the way the server handled it, he seemed genuinely concerned. I love great customer service!   Great service and the food had very nice flavors. It was quick and delicious.  I highly recommend Upton for a nice lunch and creative menu."}
{"text":"I was here about 2 weeks after the opened and I cannot wait to get back.  The design and layout of the place is right up my alley as I enjoy restaurants on the smaller side.  We ordered the burrata for an appetizer and it was really good.  I ordered the fried chicken which was phenomenal.  I would not normally ever order fried chicken, but there has not been a day that has gone by since that I haven't thought of that dish.  My only fear is that I won't ever be able to order anything else but that on my return visits!  We did the cauliflower as a side, also great.  We also had the ribs delivered to the table, compliments of the chef.  I'm not a rib person, but they were excellent.  My friend ordered the steak and again, fabulous.  Our waiter was awesome - very friendly, attentive and knowledgable.  I wish I could remember his name, but I do recall he was from WI as am I.  We were at a table outside and I did begin to get a tad chilly and before I knew it I had a blanket arrive at the table to keep me warm.  All in all, it was one of the best dining experiences I have had in quite some time.  I have seen a few negative reviews on here which I find incredibly shocking and I urge those people to return for a second try.   I know I am looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Their manager, Clayton was very accommodating and wonderful to work with when I had a special request for a large group."}
{"text":"The Upton has great food, awesome staff members and the cutest patio! I celebrated my 30th birthday on the front patio and the team members were extremely responsive, accommodating and fun! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I really would like to give this place a two, but the ambiance and char siu ribs were great.    We had a large party and it is expected things will be slightly slower, but 20-25 minutes for cocktails followed by an hour wait for dinner?  It is a new restaurant, so that's why I didn't give it a two as well since things are probably still getting worked out.   Like a few others I ordered the duck wings and they were EXTREMELY chewy and I felt like a dog trying to rip the meat off the bone.  I asked the waiter if they were supposed to be like that and sure enough he took them back.  What he brought back was a crispy fried wing and what I originally got was a pale boiled looking thing.  The chef must have partially baked/boiled them before and forgot to fry mine.  The waiter said it is the second time the chef did it that night.   Even after they were fried, they were pretty lackluster to me.  The char siu ribs are really great and pretty much I'd recommend ordering just that x4.     I also had the burrata which was one of the worst I've had in recent memory.  It was not creamy and rich at all.    Beyond the ribs, someone had the ramen and enjoyed it.  All those who had the steak thought it was fairly marginal as well as the tacos.  If you are looking for a vibe place to grab some apps and drinks then this would work.  I wouldn't go back for dinner."}
{"text":"this place is great.  Good atmosphere,  great staff, and amazing food.  they're now open for lunch and it's very affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"The place was happening and very busy but was the scene... The cocktails were perfect the fried chicken was amazing. This place is hot!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, great, imaginative cocktails with a well crafted wine list, and an atmosphere that manages to be both casual and intimate.  I highly recommend the outdoor seating area in the back and the house-made ramen which was the best I've ever had.  If I lived in the area The Upton would would absolutely be my go-to restaurant.   The Upton is a delightful slice of authenticity in the fake plastic palm tree that is Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The back patio seating area is really nice and charming. The food was fair. We started with the chopped salad which was presented in a jar and mixed at the table. Creative presentation but the salad was nothing special. We asked for goat cheese on the side instead of bleu cheese due to my wife's dietary restrictions but they gave us feta. Next we had the mussels which had good flavor but the broth was just too sweet. The fried chicken was the highlight with its light and crisp coating and fried chilies. I don't think it was enough to make me go back though."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I'm SOO beyond happy that I found this hidden gem! I've been coming  here since they first opened and I'm still a huge fan!!!  The atmosphere is awesome! Even when it's dead there's a great vibe going on here. The outside patio is wonderful for larger groups and perfect for a nice Sunday funday gathering. Rose-all-day baby!! The accent painted wall is a nice touch and ties in perfectly with the twisted classy feel of the inside bar.   Now to the service. The service has been absolutely outstanding every time I'm here! All the bartenders are super personable, have amazing attitudes not to mention make some incredible cocktails. I would say that the majority of them are extremely knowledgeable on all ends of the spectrum. The servers are also super friendly and know their stuff! Like I said before I have yet to have bad service here and I doubt I will! I must give a double high five to the friendly manager who is clearly doing a good job of training his staff and running this posh little place!!   On to the food. All I can say is BRAVO!! All the main entrées are spectacular! The southern fried chicken is mouthwatering. The Chinese char siu ribs with smoked peanuts and cilantro pesto are to die for and I could easily live off of the lemon chimichurri cauliflower and mason jar chopped salad for the rest of my life.  *** Also a little secret.... You can bring your dog along if you choose to sit on the front patio!!   Way to go guys! Keep up the amazing work!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Awesome service (Love Rachel) and good ambience but poor execution on the food. The momofuko and Korean buns were pretty tasty but everything else was just meh. Ordered the Chinese wings-too much hoisin, the fried chicken picnic-too oily, the Cuban sandwich-too much Dijon, and the Brussels sprout salad-meh. I would not come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Was invited by a few friends a week or so back, and felt right at home upon entering this new hotspot. Drinks were inventive, food was spot on and ambiance, especially the patio...alluring. Met one of the owners (Pouria) and he was the nicest guy! Can't wait for my next rendezvous at The Upton"}
{"text":"I am a little torn. The patio was super cool and I had an amazing Bloody Mary but the food was disappointing. We were there for brunch. I asked if the egg and avocado came with anything. She said on a bed of arugula. It didn't. Either way, that was about a third of a meal. There were no sides. We all thought about ordering more but it is a pretty limited bench menu and we didn't want to pay $12 for another tiny entree. The service was ok. Nice but not super prompt. Due to the food I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the vibe of the place and the waiting staff was really nice.  The reason I'm give a 2 star review is the food just wasn't good and it's way overpriced."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had the duck wings as a shared plate and the honey fried chicken for dinner with a side of shishito peppers. Great service and a very nice ambience. Good sized portions and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Three stars for good service and nice ambience. Cocktails were pretty good, too. The food, however, was flavorless and forgettable. Both the appetizer and entree were cooked well, but had zero salt or seasoning. Pouring a sauce over something should not excuse a chef from actually seasoning the food itself. No desire to return."}
{"text":"I took a couple friends from NYC the Saturday night before the super bowl.  There was quite a wait,  but was the same all over town.  We had a drink in the front patio while we waited.  We got seated, and it was a tight squeeze into the table,  sitting back to back with other customers.  The service was slow,  but frIendly.  We ordered the burrata appetizer, and the cheese was creamy,  and the fig bread with spread was tasty.  I had the grateful veggie sandwich,  and I thought it was the best veggie sandwich I ever had.  Veggies grilled nicely with goat cheese and naan type bread.  My friends had the steak which they thought was excellent.  The portions were nicely sized and was an enjoyable time."}
{"text":"The place is very quaint and the staff are friendly.  I came with a friend on a rainy night but it seems the outdoor garden area is normally quite nice.  The food was delicious!  The cocktails were pretty good as well--I would like to see a few more cocktail options.  Also, it was a little difficult to get served since it's such a small place, but it was overall very worth the experience and I can't wait to go back and try everything on their menu.    We had the fried oysters, salmon, ramen with pork (very unique and highly recommended), with cauliflower and  fries on the side. It was all so good, very reasonably priced, and I highly recommend the place for a quiet evening in a community-type setting."}
{"text":"Really good food, service, & drinks. Make sure to make reservations, because it is really small inside during the hot season. There is lots of patio seating when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Great place, quaint, cozy, classy all at the same time. Steven is a top notch, damn great service period! The food is amazing too. Must try this place, foodies check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is totally cool! Love the hole in the wall vibe. The food was not my favorite. My fiancé had the Cuban sandwich and I had the spinach gnocchi, neither of which we'd probably get again. I'd come back for a drink at happy hour, but overall I was not super happy about the food."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale for sure. Go there all the time for their $10 lunch and I promise you will not find better bang for your buck as the food is amazing. Awesome happy hour as well. Dinners are amazing and the vibe in the place is fresh, especially on the patio with some good weather. Still gotta hit up brunch there!"}
{"text":"This is a very quaint,cozy restaurant in the middle of a crazy club scene. We sat on the patio, which worked well because they had heatlamps. We ordered cocktails and it took a little longer than you might think to get them. The Upton Girl was good, but mine was way weaker than my friends. Hers was heavy on champagne.  The staff must have been \"off\" or something because service was so. SLOW. We were really hungry, and they dont serve complimentary bread or snacks. When we got our food there were some dissapointments. My friend had little to no chicken in her thai chicken salad. My other friend's salmon portion was very small for $16.  There were some highpoints. The ribs were good, tender and fell off the bone. The roasted califlower is a MUST! We wish were ordered a 2nd serving.   All in all, check this place out if you are looking to try something new."}
{"text":"Drinks were mediocre, a couple of the menu items were good, others were quite bland. One of the owners stopped by to ask how everything was and we told him. He graciously said he would comp all of the food, but when we got the bill only two items were taken off. Not sure why he said one thing and did another. Won't go back"}
{"text":"The Upton is a fantastic concept that Scottsdale needed for a long time! Small inside space, but gorgeous patio and amazing staff.   They have one of the same chefs from the previous restaurant and the attention to detail of the quality of their food and creative cuisine doesn't go un noticed.   I know one of the owners has a vegetarian pallet so they definitely are not lacking in the fresh vegetarian approach!   Haven't been since the beginning stages of the business since I now live in NYC, but can't wait to return when I'm home for the holidays!   A must try!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a great meal on the patio on a sunny Sunday late afternoon. It was almost empty when we arrived, had our choice of tables. We ordered a bottle of wine (nice selection of out of the ordinary) and the fried oysters. Omg the oysters were amazing!! I could have eaten a plateful and called it a night. Husband had the 007 style salad which was an average salad with great presentation. His entree was the mussels appetizer, my son ordered fried chicken, I had a salmon thing. The food was all good but I was still in awe of the oysters. The ONLY reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was because the service slowed down dramatically as the place filled up. Admittedly, we were not in any hurry and made that clear. When we finally placed our order though, it seemed to take forever. Maybe we are partially at fault for that. Server was great, loved the vibe in the patio, nice hidden location.... We will return."}
{"text":"Good food and great patio, just needs a bit more lively crowd."}
{"text":"I went here with my fiancé on a Saturday night. I didn't know what to expect since I used to come here when it was Petite Masion, one of my all time favorite restaurants, and was devastated when it closed. I have to say I was pleasantly and happily surprised at the new patio, service and dishes. We were able to sit outside since it was still nice out and felt completely comfortable.  We started with a glass of melbec the confit duck wings-amazing- just make sure to ask for extra sauce on the side. Then the Boa bun Momofucko. Also amazing and delish and was perfect for two. For our entrees we had the beet risotto with scallops and the steak and frits. These dishes were done to perfection! All the staff was auper considerate to us whenever we needed anything from water to a refill of our wine or just to clear the table. This is a great place to go to, I loved it and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"If you order the egg sandwich for brunch, prepare to eat somewhere else after because our entire group left hungry after ordering this entree. Better places in old town, overall disappointment."}
{"text":"A new favorite.  Have now been there twice.  The majority of the restaurant is on the patio - but still OK for summer, as they have plenty of misters and cool fans blowing.  This is a great neighborhood restaurant that is not super pretentious for the area.  The fries are amazing, as well as the cauliflower and most everything we tried.  Great food and locale, reservations recommended."}
{"text":"A new favorite for me.  Creative dishes that we really enjoyed.  They had a few tasty vegan options that I really liked!  It worked really well for this omnivore / herbivore duo!"}
{"text":"We've had dinner at Upton twice. The 2nd time was a Sunday, and the food wasn't as good. The salmon was over cooked and the chicken salty. On our previous 1st visit, both dishes were great. Salads and appetizers were fine both times. Their happy hour prices are reasonable with 50% off glasses of wine. They use the little carafes now so pours are fair and consistent. Happy hour food and cocktail prices are also discounted. The patio is nice. The music is still 90's techno which is louder inside."}
{"text":"Had the angus beef hash for brunch, delicious! The Bloody Mary was to die for! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I read that this was voted one of the best new restaurants for 2014. We arrived and it was quite a scene, which I like. A lot of pretty people. We had reservations and were seated right away. After that, however , the service was quite slow. We waited quite a long time for our food. I have to say it was worth the wait. Everything we had was delicious. We had the Chinese ribs to start and they had a nice charred flavor and fell of the bone. After that we had the farro salad, sweet snap peas and fried chicken. The salad was fresh, clean and light. The snap peas were tossed in a nice spicy sauce with a nice grilled flavor. The fried chicken was the best. Nicely seasoned and the crust was deliciously crunchy. When we got our bill, the manager personally delivered it to us and apologized for the delay and thanked us for our patience. With that he gave us a very nice discount on our bill. That's the way to to create customer satisfaction. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my cousin here and we absolutely loved the service. The owner came out and explained the menu and recommended delicious options. Lunch is $10 and the portions are decent. The turkey sandwich is a must my cousin kept eating off my plate. Turkey can sometimes be dry but this one was extra juicy and amazing. Small place but pretty charming 5 stars"}
{"text":"I would have loved to give this place 3.5 stars. We went to Upton on a Friday night without a reservation and were able to get in right away, which was great. The atmosphere was great. We sat at the \"Tree House\" outside with lights twinkling in the background. The food was good, but the portions were a bit small. We also felt like the service was just ok."}
{"text":"Made a reservation over the phone. They took my number and everything. Showed up for dinner to see a note on the door saying they closed due to electrical issues. No problem, but shouldn't you call your reservations and let people know? Very unprofessional. Wasted an hour of our time."}
{"text":"This place is so hidden I live right in old town and would've never knew it existed (Request to sit on the back patio it's beautiful) I love the modern vibe. I can't get over the atmosphere. I ordered the steak and a side of asparagus and got donuts for desert. The General Manager was so sweet and made it SO welcoming.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My boss had recommended this place and we went here for a team dinner after a work event. The manager that helped me coordinate and plan was super helpful. We were able to create a menu for our group (he even printed out personalized menus for us!) and provided great service.  The food was AWESOME. I loved the Mason Jar salad and the bao buns.  I'll probably come back with my husband for a date night but it's one of those where I won't drive all the way from Gilbert to go for a Friday date night. Probably only stick to it if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Loved it. The staff have great personality. Bartender knows her stuff. The cocktails are fantastic. Try the ribs and cauliflower for happy hour. Don't forget the Nutella banana cream pie with a graham cracker crust for dessert."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner for a friend's birthday and was SO surprised by how creative and foodie their menu was! Not to mention, their cozy, romantic patio! It is seriously the perfect date spot.    We started with the meat and cheese board that was absolutely fantastic and perfect for sharing. Then, onto the farro salad that was so fresh and delicious. I LOVE farro and always forget that it exists. I could honestly eat it every day and be a happy camper.   Now, not that I really \"needed\" another course but for the main, I ordered the pork tacos. Needless to say, my plate was licked and I am SO happy that I ordered them because the flavors were unique and perfect. I will most definitely be back soon! I would love to try out their brunch as well."}
{"text":"Trendy spot in Scottsdale. Had dinner here with some friends and had a lovely time. Its a small place with mostly outdoor seating. It wasn't too bad the night we visited so it was nice to dine outdoors.   I had the duck wings. Anyone who knows anything about duck meat knows the wings done have a lot of meat so I was a bit worries it wouldn't be enough to fill me up, surpringsly it did,I didn't even finish it. It was really good and a must try for duck lovers! Like me!!   This is a spot I would think of for a chill night out with some friends!"}
{"text":"I love the Upton because it offers something really unique in Scottsdale.  Surrounding it are your typical old town bars and restaurants, but the Upton's charm sets it apart.  Every time I go here, I forget I'm in Arizona.  If you work in the area, their lunch special is fantastic.  I've also been there for happy hour.  The food and drinks are delicious, but what I really fell in love with is the hip ambiance.  If possible, get a spot on the back patio."}
{"text":"Went to the Upton based on yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint.  We didn't have reservations and were seated at a very nice table outside on the patio.  No attitude, no wait, just friendly hostesses.  I really enjoyed the ambiance and loved the graffiti wall.  We shared the \"mason jar\" chopped salad and it was very flavorful.  Next we split the salmon and enjoyed it very much.  It was crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked.  We also shared an order of fries....ummmm, delish!  They cook them in duck fat and wow!!!   The service was terrific. Samantha was an awesome waitress.  Our water was always filled and everyone was very friendly and attentive.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Couldn't be a better place for a date or dinner with a group of friends in old town scottsdale. It is nicely secluded giving you a very private feel. The patio is nicely decorated and the lighting and set up gives you a warm relaxing vibe.     The hostess was very friendly and welcomed us in with a great smile and open arms. One of the most impressive things about the restaurant is the quality of service you will receive. I have been to the Upton twice and in both occasions the servers gave superior service. They described each dish to a science and accommodated our taste buds to what we were looking for as well. We were also greeted personally by the owner Bran. He once again showed what superior service in a restaurant is by checking on us and making sure everything was up to par. He also gave a brief history of the facility making us feel at home and asked for any feedback we had for him.    The menu is on the smaller side and the dishes are tapas style all with a  creative spin making it a very unique concept. I have tried numerous items all in which were full of flavor and just the right portion size.   I personally love a bunch of dishes here. For appetizers the crispy confit duck wings fall right off the bone, and the broth in the mediterranean mussels give them a rich savory flavor. The angus bistro steak was cooked just right and the onions on the side give the two an amazing flavor. The seared wild salmon as well was extremely light and when dipped in lemon greek yogurt give a the salmon a very good spin.    Their drink menu is also of high caliper as their drinks are made with higher quality liquors. The Refresher is just that as the combination of cucumber, mint & lime give it a cooling sensation as you drink it.   I would highly recommend the Upton for anyone in old town scottsdale as it is nothing but excellence! Thank you Bran and the Upton Team!"}
{"text":"Cool venue and good cocktails but like others have said, overpriced for what you get.  Bao buns should be listed as appetizers (2 small buns for about $13) and the Thai farro dish would make for a good snack. Food was tasty but nothing worth raving about. We ended up going straight to Wendy's for fries and frosties afterwards because we were still so darn hungry.  Also worth noting - despite the fact that we were there at 7:30 on a Friday, the place was almost completely dead which gave it a weird vibe.  That being said, the happy hour menu looked pretty solid and the bar seemed cool so maybe it's worth revisiting someday between 4-6."}
{"text":"Went to The Upton for my sister's birthday celebration a few weeks ago and cannot wait to return! The atmosphere was unbeatable with the beautiful patio and great music. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow.  That's all I can say. This place is so quaint and amazing. Such a beautiful spot tucked behind all the madness that old town scottsdale entails. The fried chicken was amazing, but the Chinese ribs are to die for. Service was excellent, not to overbearing, but just the right amount of attention. I loved that they have oshi bori hand wipes for you when you are done eating all of your finger foods.  By far, the best patio on town. Keep it up UPTON, loved every second of it."}
{"text":"We came here twice. The first time we sat in the back and last night since a storm was coming in we sat inside. Had the same waiter, he remembered us from the first time and he even remembered what we ordered and where we sat. We found this place one night when we were driving home from a night out. It's a cute restaurant. Love the outdoor seating. The service is just top notch. I recommend this place to anyone who will ask me. Both times I got the fried chicken with the ssrriranch and it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant with such charm and appeal!  We came in for dinner one evening and shared a cheese/meat board and two sandwiches - the Fro-Magg and the Little Havana.  We had way too much food, but all of it was delicious. Our server was great too - so much fun and helped guide us through our choices."}
{"text":"I am at The Upton restaurant in old town Scottstown while Miss Tessie is getting her hair done. Even in this 90* weather, their lovely patio is filled with customers. The ambiance is eclectic and delightful.  The GM, (Clayton) and bartender/server (Steven) are extremely attentive, and seem to be an excellent team.  But, most of all, the food choices are great. I had the Farro Salad and it was just fantastic!   And Steven's martini was exactly as I ordered it: house vodka, extra dry with a bunch of olives on the side."}
{"text":"You have to check out The Upton! My sisters and I came for dinner and we loved it. Great service and excellent food. My favorite appetizers were the ribs and the burrata. Order both. You won't be disappointed. For dinner we ordered the fried picnic chicken. So good! For dessert, try the smores. This fabulous new restaurant nestled in old town Scottsdale is a must try! Don't be surprised if this spot becomes your favorite neighborhood go to!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and the crispy duck confit wings are delicious.   Outdoor patio is relaxing and transforms you to an LA vibe. The music is appropriate for the scene.   Transitioned from a (past) great restaurant to another great restaurant! We will be returning!"}
{"text":"I'm going to try and be fair, given they've only been open about a month.  That said, I cannot fathom the 5 star reviews lavished on The Upton in the short time they've been open.  From my perspective, they are very much in the throes of shaking out the new restaurant kinks.  I credit the creativeness of the menu, which matches Asian and American flavors in intriguing ways.  However, I don't care how good you say the ramen is.  I live in the SF Bay Area, and have my pick of some of the best Japanese noodles this side of Tokyo.  My guess is that ramen is a new and, somewhat exotic, concept in Arizona, so I'm sure this is why it's perceived as \"so amazing\".    Anyway, on to the meal at hand.  My dinner date and I ordered the burrata starter, which resembled just regular mozzarella without any of the characteristic oozy creaminess inside.   Up next was the Mason jar chopped salad, which was essentially a salad parfait that is then tossed table side.  Yeah, it's a little gimmicky, but the salad may have been the best thing we ate all night.  My date wanted to order the fried chicken, which apparently is the best item on the menu.  So good, in fact, that our waiter informed us they were out and it would be 30 minutes before a fresh batch was battered.  Deterred, so settled on the wild salmon as a backup and I placed my order for the bistro steak.  A few minutes later, we decided that waiting 30 minutes for the fried chicken wasn't so bad and we flagged down the owner to have the order changed.  Unfortunately, he did not pass the message to our waiter or the kitchen.  This was confirmed when out waiter came around.  He then proceeded to inform us it would be far more than 30 minutes, since they have to, inexplicably, close the whole kitchen down to fry the chicken.  It seems that they only have one fryer, and the temperature for the chicken is lower than the other fried items on the menu.  This seems like a major oversight when planning the kitchen layout.  The owner later indicated he was going to buy a 2nd fryer the following week.  So, back to plan B.  Anyway, our orders arrived and they were underwhelming.  My steak, although properly cooked, was well under-seasoned and fairly boring.  The salmon was a tad over cooked, but otherwise fine on its own and pretty good with the accompanying yogurt sauce.  Service was...overly eager.  No fewer than 6 times was I asked if my plate could be taken away, when it should have been fairly obvious that I was still working on it.  We decided to pass on dessert and call it an evening.  I think what was most disappointing is that the previous restaurant in this space, Le Petit Maison, was so very good.  Hopefully the kitchen and staff at the Upton will hit a stride, but they just aren't there yet."}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance and location. New Chef Kyle is a badass. Local products, great plates. Boom."}
{"text":"Everyone else I was with liked it, I think I ordered the wrong thing. Next time I need to trust my gut and not order gluten free ramen on Scottsdale.  Others at my table got port tacos, ribs, turkey pastrami sandwhich and they said were awesome.! Next time I'll try something different :)"}
{"text":"This is a really cute space. From my recollection of the prior iteration of the restaurant, it does not look much different. Decent sized bar, cozy interior, nice patio seating in front and back. I agree with the review stating that more cocktail options would be appreciated. I would also like to see a few more by-the-glass wine options on the happy hour menu. I tried the Uptown Girl, which was light and refreshing but not terribly memorable.   The menu is a somewhat odd ethnic mix. My friends tried the steamed buns and spare ribs and seemed to like them. The burrata appetizer was really good, with toasted fig bread. The crispy cauliflower was tasty but not at all crispy (the waiter said it is supposed to be lightly fried and crispy). The sugar snap peas were really good, but drowned in too much sauce. The pibil tacos were also tasty, but cannot compete with those at Barrio Queen right down the street.  The server was helpful and friendly, without being cloying. They were very nice about turning on the patio heater when I got cold. Not sure this spot will end up in my regular rotation, but definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"One of our favorite jump-off points when venturing into Old Town. Quaint little place with modern decor and a private rear patio that gives a romantic and intimate feel. Food is always excellent, sad they no longer offer the Cornish Game Hen (with a beer can, yes, a beer can inside), but the Picnic Chicken never disappoints. Feeling like something lighter? Farro Salad (Farro, flame grapes, marcona almonds, goat cheese, radish and Charred lemon vinaigrette) just add chicken or salmon and you'll have one of the best salads ever!!! Their craft cocktail menu is awesome (I have pledged to have 100 of their Apricot Negronis, though not in one sitting of course) and you MUST try the char siu ribs, crispy confit duck wings and their Seoul Satisfaction bao bun (Korean duroc pork belly, Asian pear kimchi and Tiger sauce) for an amazing dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Both times the service was ridiculously slow. Once it was so slow they gave me my beer for free. The second time was so slow that we were able to change our order without ramifications 30 minutes after we ordered because it hadn't been started yet. That being said, the cocktails here are amazing and I do enjoy the atmosphere. I think I'll just stick with the drinks here, as when the food came out it wasn't even amazing."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner With some family and friends and had the most enjoyable fun night here! Our server was so knowledgeable and really made us feel welcome! The the food was absolutely delicious  along side their refreshing cocktails and wine! The owner even stopped by the table with a little birthday card for me! Thanks to such outstanding hospitality I cannot wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place with my family and my parents.  First of all, the staff are so warm and friendly.  The owner was there also and was really engaging.  It was a hot day so I ordered a Hendrick's and tonic with their house made tonic.  Wow!  I didn't expect tonic to have color but it was amazing.  Our server was great.  She was super friendly and great with my young daughter.  We had the charcuterie which was great.  Then my wife and I both had the salmon with the farro salad under it.  Probably the best salmon I've ever eaten.  Beautifully prepared - so much so that I asked how they got it so perfectly crusted.  The chef and owner actually invited me to come by to learn how to cook it.  These guys are really that great.  On the whole, we've been looking for another reason to come back and will be back again soon I'm sure."}
{"text":"A great little gem hidden in downtown Scottsdale. It's small but intimate. The food is stellar and the service was wonderful. We sat on their patio and the atmosphere was very comfortable and welcoming. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I will probably come back here only for a drink of I'm looking for something low key. They have a nice patio with a good vibe. Although I think our table was behind storage or a big freezer or fridge because staff kept going back there and going inside the freezer and I would get breezes of cold air throughout the night making me cold throughout my meal every time they would open the fridge.  I wasn't impressed with my food or my boyfriends. It was ok. Nothing worth coming again for. The chicken tasted off in my salad so I ended up picking it all out and not eating it. Also took over an hour for us to get our food!!!! Our waiter gave us a discount without us even saying anything because he knew it took way too long!!! Especially since I got a salad!  New place, but with some proper tweets and some new dishes from the chef this could be a good spot for a date night or a chill night to grab a drink and dinner with a friend. Great location and patio, move the freezer!!!!"}
{"text":"I am writing this absolutely wonderful 5 star review because I believe this is a true gem in Scottsdale. I met the owner and staff at their ribbon cutting a few weeks back and was so impressed with their ambience, friendliness, staff and most importantly food for cost! Their lunch menu caters to the busy workers in the area, guaranteeing you quick service. My co-workers and I were in and out in an hour. FAB! We were also pleasantly surprised when the gracious owner treated our 3rd co-worker to lunch (we were getting it to go as she could not step away from the office, totally made her day!). I sincerely hope this place is here to stay for quite some time to come, Scottsdale is lucky to have you! I hear they have awesome Sunday brunch as well and look forward to going to that one day soon!"}
{"text":"We came here during Spring Training for dinner and cocktails. Clayton was so nice- he gave us a super table in a view corner. Kevin, our server, was so friendly and helped us pick great drinks and the small plates and entrees that we all shared.  The drinks were sublime...and the ribs were out of this world. We were also pleased that the bill wasn't outrageous- it's rare to find a restaurant that has great service, drinks and food at reasonable prices. We will definitely visit this gem again."}
{"text":"Cute little trendy restaurant.  The inside of the restaurant itself is small, but there is plenty of outdoor seating.  We ordered the pork ribs, the chopped salad and a few of the buns.  Everything was pretty good.  The portion of the ribs were quite large.  I love that the chopped salad.  It was served in a mason jar!  How cool!  We ordered a few drinks as well.  Not bad!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is to die for. Try the fried chicken. Best in town. All the sides are amazing as well they really have such great flavor. Can't wait to come here with my fiance and friends as this is my new go to spot. Awesome patio and bar and the service is great too."}
{"text":"Super cute, small and trendy restaurant.  It serves up unique entrees and drinks with an upscale \"hole-in-the-wall\" vibe. The Ramen noodles are probably the best menu item by far.  It may sound boring, but it is a wonderful dish. The broth is flavorful, noodles cooked just right and a good amount of veggies thrown in to make it filling (tad heavy on the mushrooms, but not a deal breaker). They have other entrees that a tasty too, just not as great as the ramen. Other notables: clean bathrooms, service is great, stiff drinks.  My only suggestion would be to improve their sweet selections.  I've been twice and each time the dessert menu was sparse and less than appealing.  I tried their chocolate tart on our last visit, just see if it tasted better than the description... sadly, it was ho-hum.  Oh well, their ambiance and entrees are enough to keep me coming back.  FYI, there is not a lot of seating inside, but plenty of patio seating."}
{"text":"The ambience is delightful to say the least (a unique and hip environment, not only did this restaurant stimulate my senses visually,  all the dishes from the perfectly cooked rib appetizer, to some good fried chicken. Everything was on point! A wonderful place to hang out with the man that recommended our date night, My Daddy!!  Our server Quinn even pick two dishes and paired one with an awesome white wine. The Manager Phil was extremely engaged with us and his friendly staff. I can't wait to have another gathering with my loved ones at this new restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is good but has a very limited menu. The service is good but on the edge of been annoying. Quit coming back every 3 minutes to check on me and let me eat! The atmosphere is great if you like only eating outside as there VERY few tables inside. The outside however is very nice and has a great ambiance. My only complaint is that when we were leaving there were quite a few bugs roaming around! Eww. All in all the food was great but I don't see what the hype was all about. It's a good place to go if there's nothing else."}
{"text":"This place is so laid back and just a wonderful environment in general. Greeted promptly and taken to a table outside. Their menu is small yet has so many choices. I choose the salmon and kale salad and it was pretty big and I could not eat all of it. I never knew this place was here as it is sort of hidden off to the side of Scottsdale Road. After dinner the canal and shopping is right there to go to so it is actually in a great spot. I would say a dinner for two would be about $40-$60 with drinks and appetizer. OH, their fries are AMAZING."}
{"text":"This review is for their lunch. I have not gone here at night yet. By far this is the best deal vs. quality for lunch in the area. For $10 you can get a drink, fries [which they make and are amazing], and one of the menu items. The portions are perfect and staff is super friendly. That price included tax. If someone else knows of a place that has a high quality $10 lunch bring it on."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. I LOVE the atmosphere. Lovely trees and outdoor seating. They have massive umbrellas to assure the sun doesn't hit your eyes. I liken it to OHSO but smaller, a little dressier, and more romantic. I came on a Sunday where I had unlimited mimosas. Our server was fabulous too. Very attentive. They had a good menu as well. Huge fan of brunch- theirs ranges from traditional bacon and eggs, to captain crunch waffles. I'll come back for sure. I'm confident we can make this place popular!"}
{"text":"I am so excited about uptown Is one of the most genuine and delicious places to drink and eat in town! They create a fantastic unpretentious experience to return to over and over!"}
{"text":"Totally great meal. Cheap bottomless mimosas... Amazing food. The lox was great (was served on toast so it's not super heavy)... We added avocado to the lox and it was so awesome. Service was great. Ambiance was great. Eat outside! Like an oasis in the desert :)"}
{"text":"I haven't had a fabulous meal out in several weeks, but decided tonight I needed to break my dry spell. Arriving at Upton we were quickly greeted by the hostess. While we hadn't made a reservation (a must on Saturday night) we were offered a place at the bar. After being seated we were quickly waited on and provided with a menu. The specialty drinks looked amazing, and made it even more difficult to pass up as I watched  the bartenders prepare the drinks. As I'm not drinking for now, I quickly moved to the food menu. I was immediately drawn to the duck confit wings with Sriracha ranch dressing. The meat on the duck wings fell of the bone and was rich and succulent. For my entree I had the steak while my friend had the salmon. The steak was cooked beautifully and was juicy and flavorful. The Salmon was fresh and a perfect pink color. We shared an order of the fries which may have been my favorite part (I'm a sucker for fries). The service was outstanding, we were checked on several times by various staff other than our bartender/server and our glasses were never empty. The prices were reasonable and for the two of us our bill was under $50 (without alcohol). Looking forward  to another great meal!"}
{"text":"Was at Scottsdale Fashion Square yesterday and my friend and I were looking for a restaurant where he could get a steak but had good veggie items for me as his final meal in Scottsdale before moving. After doing some yelping and looking at menus we decided on The Upton as I had heard a lot about it on Instagram before! We arrived at about 6:30 pm on Sunday and it was pretty empty, not a whole lot of people there which was nice. The Upton was a cute little restaurant, kind of hipster-y looking, but I liked it! We were seated right away and asked if we wanted bottled or tap water which I thought was fancy haha. We went for tap water. We were starving and immediately knew what we wanted to order. Unfortunately our server did not recognize us being on the verge of hangry with our culinary decisions made. She talked about like every item on the menu. Blah blah blah. Like I don't mind if you want to tell us a little bit about the specials but she went on and on and on and we were going nuts. She was sweet though!  I got the Uptown girl to drink, and the veggie sandwich with a side of French fries to eat. Was surprised by how expensive everything was! The drink was very small and almost all ice, which sucks for a $12 cocktail. I did enjoy it though. Loved my food as well, but that was a tiny sandwich for $11 to not come with any sides. The french fries were absolutely delightful. Veggies on the sandwich were very fresh and tasty as well, loved the goat cheese on the naan bread. My friend was quite disappointed with his meal which made me sad, his last Scottsdale restaurant experience wasn't a good one. He thought the steak was sub par, said he could have made a better one for cheaper! Also his shoestring potatoes weren't very good. I tried them and didn't like them either. My experience at the Upton wasn't the greatest, but there were some perks to it, food was good and restaurant was cute! But I could have definitely gotten an equally fresh and tasty meal for a significantly lower price somewhere else."}
{"text":"We love this place. Best fried chicken in town. Also Duck Wings, mason jar chopped salad. OhHo and those great fries!"}
{"text":"We just discovered The Upton this weekend and I'm pumped we did.  We went for brunch and we will definitely be back for brunch again plus I can't wait to try their happy hour (which is everyday) and dinner.   Bottomless Mimosas, a beautiful patio, friendly staff and delicious food made for a great Sunday Brunch! The only downside is that brunch is only offer on Sundays."}
{"text":"Attention people who like bad food. Don't come to the Upton, because the food is amazing. Each bite I took reminded me what it felt like when I lost my virginity.  This is what Scottsdale needed. The duck wings are a must"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to this restaurant at the annual Devoured event at the Phoenix Art Museum.   If you haven't checked out Devoured, you should.   Lots of restaurants, etc. give a sampling of their food and drinks to introduce prospective customers to their establishment.  I liked what I had at the event so I went there with my friend afterwards. And since I had such an enjoyable experience, I chose it for my birthday bash with my favorite gal pals.    I didn't get around to writing a review for those events, but I will now.   Prior, it was cool enough to sit on the patio.   Not today.   Too hot!   Sat inside with a friend for happy hour.   I won't write about the drinks we had but I will about the food.  We had the CHINESE CHAR SIU RIBS and the KOREAN PORK STEAMED BUNS.   Yummmm!!   I have had the ribs on the two prior occasions.   I think it's my favorite.   The meat just falls right off the bones and the flavoring is perfect.  It's lick-your-fingers good.  I wasn't sure about ordering the steamed buns, but I thought, \"What the heck.\"    WHOA!    Double yummm on those as well.  The bun is soft and fluffy, and the the pork is flavored with a sort of Asian sauce I couldn't quite put my finger on.    I would definitely order that again.   The owner Shawn/Shaun/Sean is a definite hands-on owner.   He is friendly and greets the customers as they come in and talks to them in a very nonintrusive way.   Yes, you can bet I would definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Saw it whilst walking to another bar and decided to try it out. Awesome vibe, gorgeous patio and fantastic, reasonably priced food.  Bottomless mimosas are $18. Seriously can't beat that. Would 10/10 come back here."}
{"text":"The Upton restaurant which usually offers late afternoon and night fare has recently added brunch to its menu.  This trial period that is open to the public with reservations is Saturday the 17th and Saturday the 24th.  For only $25 you can sample two amazing brunch entrees with endless mimosas and bloody Mary's.  With Upton's quant and relaxing atmosphere this is the perfect place for morning brunch.  Then there's the food....amazing!   Whether it's the grill cheese with a fried egg in the middle or the refreshing vegetable tart.  I highly recommend trying Upton's new take on brunch."}
{"text":"5 stars for the ambiance, 4 stars for the food. We had the duck appetizer, the burrata, the fried chicken the salmon and a panini. The salmon was very well done, but fairly plain, and the chicken had a great crunch, but at the end of the day was fried chicken. Fairly priced, but nothing too special. I will be back, but im looking for their something special on their menu."}
{"text":"Nice little place. The atmosphere is the best part of this place. The staff is friendly. The patio is nice and cool due to the portable AC units and mists. Inside is a little crowded but nice still. The portions are small. Specially the steak. I order the Hotel Nacional drink and it's overpriced. The glass is about 8 oz? Not worth $12 at all. One of our parties order the pull pork and it was the best value. I recommend this place to come and enjoy the patio but not if you are looking for a full dinner experience. The menu is overall overprice for the small portions, entrees don't come with side dishes, you'll have to pay separately and they are about $6.  I will return but not for dinner. I recommend this place as a social place to meet friends."}
{"text":"Very hip place with amazing service! The ribs were tasty. The chop salad was too busy with eggs, ham, and a bunch of other stuff that is shaken in a mason jar. Not the best I've had. Cowboy Ciao chopped salad is far superior. The fried chicken was triple breaded and soft not crispy. Culinary dropout fried chicken is much tastier. The Nutella banana cream pudding was good not great. The steak looked tasty"}
{"text":"Came here for Easter brunch and loved everything I ordered. I shared the strawberry toast, avocado tacos and egg grilled cheese with my date. Yummy.   The uptown girl is also a refreshing cocktail."}
{"text":"Fantastic addition to the Downtown Scottsdale area. We can't say enough about the menu. They are passionate and driven to make sure patrons have an exceptional experience. Insanely good fried chicken. perfect cocktails and a great atmosphere. Can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed. Food was tasty, but service even better.   We were looking for a steakhouse in old town, but it was Friday night and the wait time was far too long at all of them. We Yelped to find another option and stumbled upon The Upton. Decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed.   When we arrived there was a short wait, but we were greeted promptly by the hostess who warned us to watch our step (slanted doorway in old building). They offered us an opportunity to get a drink at the bar while we waited and made sure to transfer our tab to the table without us even having to ask.   The waitress heard the order wrong for one of the people in our group (between his accent and the noisy patio, it's no big surprise there might be a mistake). When the food came out and we realized the mistake they were quick to fix the issue and even offered to comp that dish. We were not upset, nor did we ask for the dish to be comp'd, so this was a pleasant surprise. Then, they even comp'd a drink because they took so long to bring it out and had to be reminded. Again, we were not upset and did not ask for the comp. We were in no hurry and just enjoying our time.   Finally, I was too busy talking with my friends that I ate very slowly and filled up quickly, so when the waitress noticed I hadn't eaten much of my yummy salmon, kale, and goat cheese salad she asked if my meal was okay and if I wanted something else.   I would highly recommend this place. They strive for excellent service and it is obvious from the moment you walk in the door to the time you leave.   In fact, I'm meeting another friend for dinner this week and recommended we meet here since I was so impressed."}
{"text":"Feeling a little deceived by the high ratings.  Duck wings were chewy beyond belief. Order of four, hardly ate one.   Steak was cooked via sous vide which would be nice if it wasn't so bland.  Grilled onions are supposed to compliment the flavor, not lead.   Fried chicken was so-so but not inspiring by any means.   Conclusion : I'd definitely go back for drinks but would not eat here again until the food improves."}
{"text":"Our first visit for lunch. Not great. Food was OK but nothing special and for sure not enough to bring you back for more. Sat at the bar once a couple of weeks ago around 5pm and there was a good dinner crowd so something must be working OK for them but skip it for lunch, there are lots of better choices within a couple of blocks."}
{"text":"After reading all the 5 star reviews about this place I came here with my significant other and her mom and sister. We had reservations for 7:30pm and got to the place early; and relaxed outside and had a few drinks while we waited; and our table was ready at promptly 7:30pm.   We were seated and proceeded to order a few drinks and some appetizers, we order d the bone marrow, the shishito peppers and the green goddess cruidite. The shishito peppers were awesome, the bone marrow was just ok (smelled a bit odd compared to other bone marrow a I have had) and the green goddess was tasty (lettuce, some pickled radishes?, and some veggies and pesto mixed together). So overall the appetizers this far was maybe a 3.5-4 stars..   After appetizers we ordered our main courses. Now keep in mind the place is jam packed so our waitress was a bit busy, but it took a while for us to get our first dish which was the scallops and risotto, the risotto was absolutely delicious... And then while one person enjoyed their meal we waited about 20-30 minutes for the rest of the dishes to come out.. And they were all awful; the scallops tasted like they had been severely overlooked (they were probably under their heat lamp since I think the waitress genuinely forgot about us). The overall experience was awful, and I would not come back."}
{"text":"Yummy and adorable, with a hip eclectic style. I had read the yelp reviews and was curious to check out this place myself. Boy am I glad that I did. At first we were disappointed by not being seated in the funky courtyard, but it turned out that our table next to the French doors was perfectly wonderful. Our waiter was delightful and helpful. Food was creatively prepared and delicious. The ribs were excellent and fell off the bone. The pork tacos were outstanding. Even my friends veggie sandwich was a standout.  A new favorite. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The chef Chris and the manager Phil and our server Quinn were phenomenal. The atmosphere was so amazing! And the food and wine was divine!! For only being open for 4 months this place takes the cake. We are on our long weekend away celebrating our 15 year anniversary from Reno NV. And this place would fit right in to our amazing Midtown area. Thank you!   Mark & Jen Gardella."}
{"text":"Not very vegetarian friendly. I had the Vegan Raman which was fairly bland and minimal noodles. I wish I would have ordered the Charred Tomato Sandwich. Their cocktails are great but expensive! The ambiance was nice but I doubt I'll return unless it's just for drinks on the patio."}
{"text":"The type of place that will **sigh** under there breath if you don't order an alcohol beverage with your meal.   Had \"the Upton\" for Sunday brunch and it was delicious. I will say the restaurant does care more about the plate presentation than the food; an example.. I had to ask for gravy on the side since both biscuits came dry, unlike the ham that was covered.   TL;DR. Probably won't come here again unless I'm stuck directly on Shoeman again, too much you'll miss in Scottsdale for a ho-hum place like this."}
{"text":"Strolled in as it was a short jaunt from the W Hotel I was residing at. While confined to the indoors due to the heat, I was pleasantly surprised by the menu , service, staff and basically most everything about the restaurant. The ribs (app.) were heavily hyped, and delivered, the salad I ordered was fresh and was a huge portion, but most of all, the newbie bartender, jacqueline, (sorry for spelling J) provided superb bar service."}
{"text":"Checked out The Upton last night and fell in love.  The service was warm and friendly and the outside area was so beautiful.  So many different places to sit and have drinks and dinner.  Really enjoyed their menu and their drinks.  We had four cocktails between us and had the fried chicken and ramen dishes that were delicious.  Our first order of drinks came out after an extended period of time, so at the end of the meal, our server gave us vouchers for drinks on them next time.  Very thoughtful and appreciated.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Discovered this spot from a local blogger, so decided to come here last night for dinner with my boyfriend. We have been in AZ for almost two weeks, and The Upton was hands down one of our most favorite dining experiences while we were here. Our server Kevin was the best! We we're both tired, and weren't sure what we were in the mood for, but Kevin exquisitely guided us through his menu favorites, describing each dish to the tee and guided our palate through the dish flavors. We chose to eat everything Kevin recommended and it was amazing! We started off with the short ribs which was perfection. Fell right off the bone and had a slight crunch to them with an Asian infused flavor. My boyfriend had the jerk chicken special which was beyond delicious (I had to steal half). The chicken was tender, the jerk flavor wasn't over bearing, and the brussel sprouts that accompanied them were the best I've ever had. I had the mason jar salad which came in a large mason jar, and Kevin shook it up for us with the dressing. Delicious and awesome presentation. Lastly we had the couscous side with pork belly. I could it eat it as a meal alone everyday....it was that good! Drinks were good as well. I had the refresher which was very \"refreshing\".  All in all our experience was beyond our expectations. Cool vibe and atmosphere. Love that nothing on the menu is over $20, but is some of the best food I've ever had. We were the last to be in the restaurant since we came in late, but did not once feel rushed. Highly recommend this place. It's mostly patio seating, but it was nice out last night. Don't leave the Scottsdale area without coming here! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, superb drinks, and a fine staff make dining at The Upton a phenomenal experience. The duck wings are a great way to start off the night! A must try for sure."}
{"text":"Cute little spot right in Old Town. Went with a friend for happy hour and enjoyed the sunshine, drinks, and some tasty apps. Half off wines and $4-6 for appetizers can't be beat. Definitely recommend the shishitos and burrata. We ended up staying for dinner and loved the fried chicken. Cornbread cookie anyone?? Sounds weird but it was amazing! Do it."}
{"text":"After the first time I came here I was raving about the food, service, and the overall experience. Unfortunately, the second time I've come the experience was not quite the same. The food was mediocre at its best.  So now for two unlimited mimosas, chilequiles, angus beef hash, and toast left us at $77.00.  They were not huge portions but thought they would have been based off of the price very disappointing. In my opinion, the brunch menu should have more of a variety and offer more food. It doesn't help that we overhear the staff complaining about the tip. Very unprofessional.... Very unlikely that I will return to this establishment. Disappointment is an understatement."}
{"text":"The service was brilliant and the food was pretty awesome. We sat outside and right away the manager rushed over to make sure we had an umbrella over us to create shade. He promptly brought over a water bowl for our dog too (without us having to even ask). Our server Kevin was fantastic. He made some great food and drink recommendations. We had the captain crunch pancakes (amazing) and the pork chilaquiles (solid). We had a regular Bloody Mary and a Bloody Mary infused with cucumber gin (which was out of this world). I probably would have had another 5 of bloodys if they were a little cheaper. Overall, a little pricy, but hey its scottsdale. We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"We had a great time here celebrating a friends bday- they brought us all a round of champagne to celebrate (and it was good champagne :-)) food was good- the noodles weren't my favorite- but the salmon was incredible. The staff was the best part and so accommodating- we will be back!"}
{"text":"Love coming here! Whether it's lunch, dinner or just drinks the atmosphere is chic but charming!! One of our go to date night restaurants!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed both Brunch and Dinner at The Upton and have been blown away each time.   Having Brunch on the patio is a great way to spend your Sunday afternoon. From lovely patio to the live band playing The Upton knows how to create a wonderful ambiance. Had the Scottish Smoked Salmon and Bloody Mary which both were to die for. Honestly, I've enjoyed everything I have ordered or tasted at The Upton.  Its a must when in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Came here for the Fiesta Bowl. We sat on the brand new, ficus surrounded patio with heaters. Food and service were excellent. Friendly staff, delicious food- my foodie friends raved about the oysters and garlic dipping sauce for the fries. My husband and I liked the steak and fried chicken. The pickles were yummy and a chef secret. A definite place for foodies and normies alike."}
{"text":"Second time here for brunch. Everything on the menu is creative and thus far delicious. Flavor combinations along with textural complexity elevate each dish I have had. Service has always been extremely friendly and informative. If you sit outside, between the service and atmosphere it pretty much like a high end backyard dinner party. Highly recommend for those seeking tasty food in a family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Met friends for drinks and dinner.   Love the decor of the place.  My friends were glowing about the food.  I didn't like sitting out back on the patio at night since it is so poorly lit.  There was one string of christmas lights barely draped over a corner of the very long table seating about 10 people.  When they brought the food and said what was in each bowl, I guess I had to take their word because I couldn't see anything.. not appealing to me.  Would be fine to sit out there at night for drinks or during daylight.... or after they hire a lighting designer to make it more appealing.   Drinks and service were outstanding."}
{"text":"I had dinner and drinks at \"The Upton\" in Scottsdale last night. A very cool spot that had been the \"Petite  Maison for years ( near Scottsdale road and Camelback).  The food was awesome. A very unique blend of master chef created items that are in many ways \"American with a comfort food feel\".  The parking was great and the inviting patio was filled with a great casual  atmosphere.  The drink menu had uniquely \"in house\" concoctions that would please anyone with an adventurous  palette. Amazing  Finally... The staff was awesome. Truly \"on top of it\" and great to talk to as well.   I recommend this to anyone that wants great food, amazing house music and not to have 40 TV's dominating the agenda with raucous sports fans yelling. So much In Scottsdale has become just that.   Im heading back.  Great spot"}
{"text":"I found this place while visiting Scottsdale.  The food here was awesome.  The salmon was flavorful and light.  The chopped salad is a must, I still dream about.  This place is a must for an great meal with tasty cocktails.  The atmosphere was trendy and fun with great service."}
{"text":"Great food great service fantastic atmosphere.  The drinks are some of the best in town. I have yet to experience fried chicken as good. Matt is a great bar tender."}
{"text":"The Upton is a really cute that has a good vibe and great patio seating. Our server was a bit quirky but it made our experience entertaining. The Manager was really nice and gave us a voucher for two free drinks on our next visit cause the service was a little slow.   We ordered the ribs which were a bit overdone but the sauce was still good. We then ordered the fried chicken and the pork tacos.  I thought the chicken was good but kind of bland compared to some other places that I've had it. The tacos hit the spot though.   We tried a few of their craft cocktails and were quite impressed.   All in all we liked The Upton and definitely plan to come back very soon!"}
{"text":"This place omg!!!! Kevin was not only knowledgeable, but friendly & attentive!!! The Chicken Fried Chicken was to die for and the Simple Salad was delish, but the Nutella Cream Brûlée was out of this world, thank you for an awesome Easter Brunch!!! Not to mention bottomless mimosas!!!"}
{"text":"I just don't know what to say about this place. The food was ok but the staff was superficial, artificial, and contrived. I don't know if it was just because the place is new or what but it just really lacked any warmth or any inviting sense. I was invited here as part of an event for a friend and was treated with snide remarks and overall strange rude behavior. The food did not make up for the behavior. I ordered veggie ramen and in the end my bowl found a big piece of pork - but the dish was really missing salt more than fat. The fried chicken did look good though. Overall, no point of paying money to be treated like crap."}
{"text":"We had an 8:00 reservation this past Friday for our first dinner at The Upton. I always forget what a shitshow parking in Old Town can be (It's like I've blacked out the memories of living near there like a PTSD victim) so word to the wise: take advantage of their valet.  First impression: This place is tiny and CUTE! As a few other reviews have mentioned, the majority of seating options are outdoors. I hope this doesn't deter business in the blazing hot months that are just weeks away (sob), but with ample tree coverage, tons of umbrellas and hopefully a strong mister system, I think evenings out on this back patio will still be pleasant in the summer.  We started off splitting the farro salad, which was a tasty mixture of perfectly-cooked farro, roasted cauliflower, diced tomatoes and arugula/herbs all tossed together. It comes with a charred lemon half for squeezing over the whole thing, which is a refreshing touch. The menu doesn't mention cauliflower and tomatoes at all, so just an FYI. (Fiance doesn't LOVE cauliflower, so it would have been nice to know about.)  For mains we chose the vegan ramen with tofu (for me, obviously) and the Little Havana sandwich. The ramen bowl was outstanding! Deliciously spiced tofu, a variety of mushrooms and a ton of other veggie mix-ins all made for a tasty (and huge; I tried my hardest but I think there was still half left) bowl. The \"Little\" Havana was a not-so-little take on the Cuban that got rave reviews. We decided to split a side of fries...because who cares?! They were hand-cut and I couldn't stop dipping into the bowl long after I was full. Clearly, portions are great here.   (That's code for: Maybe don't be so fat like us and order like it's your last meal on earth.)  All in all, a tasty-face visit!"}
{"text":"Quinn was so charming AND knowledgeable. She totally set up the perfect menu for us with great wine pairing. We thoroughly enjoyed our whole experience on the Upton's lovely patio!! Yay!:) The ribs, fried chicken, salmon with farro salad were all great!"}
{"text":"Ok.  The steak was amazing. The fried chicken was amazing. The cauliflower was amazing.   Sat on the patio and really enjoyed the ambiance.   Good night with friends :-)"}
{"text":"Celebrated my husband's birthday. The patio is beautiful and management was super accommodating for our party. The fried chicken was ridiculously good with an original flair. We were a rather large party with several checks so cashing out didn't go well....maybe not the best option for larger parties but a must regardless."}
{"text":"Owner was very nice. Drinks were good. Music was terrible and most of the food was average at best."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal, my wife had the salmon, I had the fried chicken. Both were amazing. Really great vibe here, service was excellent,loved it."}
{"text":"Visiting AZ and found this place by chance. Glad we did. The food and service was excellent. We ordered way too much food but we had to since it all looked so good. The mason jar chopped salad was great and the jar was a cool touch. The pork tacos also stood out to me when they melted in my mouth. We also loved the plantains that looked like waffle fries. I highly recommend. Oh yeah and it was so good we will go back tonight with the family."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch, loved the atmosphere,  live music, delicious mimosa, and the food was great. Recommended to anyone looking for a fun cool place to enjoy some fid and drink at any time of day. 20% industry discount don't hurt either. Keep up the good work guys!!"}
{"text":"Awesome little gem in the middle of clubby hipster ville. Nicely understated cool with EXCELLENT food and craft drinks. You really should share to get the most of this unique place. The 007 chop salad is hugely delicious, but by far my favorite are the Asian inspired ribs - amazing. Love the intimate patio vibe with cool current music. Really a great date night place that is modest on prices for solidly good food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to have dinner here!  I recently used The Upton as part of a dine-around for a group of 200 attorneys from across the country during their annual meeting, held in Phoenix.  The dine-around was the first night, and most of the attendees were on Eastern time and exhausted by their 8pm reservation.  Even though it was about a 25 minute drive from our resort, more than one of the dozen attorneys who dined there told me it was well worth the drive and the late hour.  They complimented the setting, the menu selections, their specific dinner choice, the wine list, the service, and the owner!!  Needless to say, it was a fantastic opening event experience, which not only reflects well on the owners and staff of The Upton, but on me as well.  Thank you for taking good care of my travel-weary clients!  If I am back in Phoenix, I will stop in to say thank you in person...and stay for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of girlfriends for happy hour. Happy hour menu did not disappoint, we tried some of the asian fusion dishes. We ordered the char siu ribs, the korean buns, and califlower appetizers. Char siu ribs were good. But I highly recommend trying the korean buns! It was delicious and such a different combination of flavors. Amazed at how good it tasted!  Our server was very attentive and pleasant to talk to. He shared with us a few tips before each dish and appeared very knowledgable about the menu. For one of my drinks, he recommended the Refresher but instead of gin to substitute it with vodka. Very good! In my opinion, better than the Uptown Girl drink.   We were seated out in the patio. Very cute decor and kind of hipsterish. Cute spot for happy hour or date night. Overall experience was great!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor area; ambiance was perfect for meeting up for a late cocktail with an old friend."}
{"text":"The food was average. I don't think I'll be back. I ordered the walnut, grape, green apple, Gorgonzola , salad with chicken. I had to ask for dressing since I couldn't taste any. It has a nice patio and one of the servers tried really hard to make up for our other server. My friend ordered a noodle dish and also didn't think it was amazing. It could be that they are just not known for their salads."}
{"text":"I went to happy hour and sat at the bar.  The duck wings and tacos were great and worth it.  They also carried Zubrowka Vodka which is my new go to Martini.  It is a grass bison flavored vodka that is so smooth.  The pork riblets I had were ok, nothing to write about.  I would not order them again."}
{"text":"After reading some great reviews, I really wanted this place to be amazing and expected it to be pretty good.  We came here on a whim late Sunday afternoon around 4 pm for a late lunch/early dinner. As soon as we entered, we were handed menus presumably by the manager and told they were only serving half of their happy hour items - the dinner menu wouldn't be available for another hour and the other happy hour items, they were out of.   Since my fiance was absolutely starving, we decided that we'd stay and find something from the limited menu to order.   From my 5 or so options, I took the the pork tacos, while my fiance took the ribs. We weren't impressed with either one. My pulled pork was pretty dry and lacked flavor... his ribs were about the same.   Along with a SUPER limited food menu, the beer list wasn't anything impressive. I think I counted 8 beers listed.  We left regretting going there and didn't understand why the dinner menu wasn't being served yet. Most of the items on the dinner menu wouldn't seem to take a lot of prep work.. I remember seeing salads, simple burgers/sandwiches  We ended up eating somewhere else after we left for a real dinner. Won't return, but glad we tried it out.  My advice - if you're going to serve an already super limited menu, make sure the food tastes amazing. Otherwise, give your patrons options regardless of if they're dining at 4pm (when you open) or 9pm."}
{"text":"Good food but the manager and other diners do not want diners that speak above a whisper. We were asked to be quiet after one in our party raised her voice in telling a story - by the way, it was 7:30 on a Friday night and we are 40 year old friends catching up. Too many other good restaurants in Scottsdale....."}
{"text":"Great service, great food & gorgeous setting!  What a welcomed addition to Scottsdale.   Thank you for a fun evening!"}
{"text":"The Upton has quickly become an upscale, yet casual favorite of mine. The bar area offers a minimalist yet classy setting, the cocktail list & bartender do a fine job of catering to each guest's preference.   The menu is full of fun & creative shareable items. Each time i've gone it was primarily for drinks & i had eaten prior to arriving so I've only snacked on the pibil tacos, the foie gras/bone marrow dish, & ramen.   Both the ramen & pibil are well constructed, but each is severely lacking in regards to heat from spice. Something that is commonplace among nearly every restaurant in scottsdale.   The foie gras bone marrow dish is a bit of an adulteration, but i still like it. The bone marrow is removed from the bone then combined with foie gras to form a pate, then placed back into the bone & baked and served to you with toast. It's creamy, salty, & definitely makes a statement on your palate.   The exterior of the Upton is definitely another highlight, it's intimate, upscale, & arguably romantic as they offer beautiful patio dining or lounging, while using their garden design & location to keep out the din of the nearby old town scottsdale drunks.   I look forward to returning & i'll make sure to bring my appetite along next time to enjoy the mussels & fried chicken."}
{"text":"You know when you go to a restaurant, and when you walk in there is this vibe and you think to Oh Yeah, this place is special. And every person you meet from the greeter, to the server has this energy and way of interacting with you that just makes the evening special. Everyone looks and acts like they really like working there and want you to have a great experience. And then the food. You know how it is when you get your food and when they place it in front of you your eyes widen and you get this big smile. And then you take your first bite, and you close your eyes and you take a moment to enjoy the party going on in your mouth and you can't wait to have the person your with try it. Well none of that happened last night at The Upton. When we walked in the feeling was sad, depressed. The greeter who initially looked at us for what felt like a long time before coming over. I had told them when I made the reservation that we were coming to celebrate our 39th anniversary. The greeter says happy anniversary in a flat affect and tone. I have to tell you we went there because their web page stated they had fixed up their patio, and it was specifically designed to provide a welcoming and heat resistant patio due to improvements they had made. They were also having a special menu trying out new items, and there were items on their regular menu I was interested in. Well the patio looked nothing like the picture on the webpage. It was a narrow space along the side of the building. And the special feature to provide a heat resistant patio was an old portable evaporative unit that made metal clanking noises. The walls were full of spider webs and looked like it hadn't been cleaned or painted in a while. The person who waited on us was ok. She didn't do anything wrong, but there was no energy, friendliness, interest. And of course the food. It wasn't bad, it was OK. We had duck confit wings. That was good, but what isn't when it's fried. Everything else was Ok. But nothing that made me say to my wife, \"you have to try this\"!!! With the amount of really good places to go, and new places coming I wouldn't recommend the Upton, and my wife and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Eating dinner on the patio, now with buzzwords:  Greenery and heat lamps shroud our enclave. Sensory overwhelm pre-meal..? Rare, but well-done.  Pillows, just Moroccan enough. 90's alternative music, just loud enough.  Chef Chris's Char Siu ribs: next time, I won't share. Tattooed server with sometimes-British accent... actually, I'd share with you.  Strings of glowing bulbs, twinkling above fried chicken and cornbread. An added side of honey, just because we can.  Damn, this lighting's got me waxing-poetic. Or is just this warm 'smores cake-in-a-jar?  A vanilla creme brûlée, delicate and fragrant.  We fade out to Bush's \"Glycerine.\"  Tl;dr: a glorious hodgepodge of cultural cluster, too tasteful to be random.  If this is what we're calling New American... bring it on, New America."}
{"text":"My old roommate, Sarah, and I were super excited to try this place so we brought our boyfriends and went for the full experience; we were ready to spend some money. We didn't make reservations which I suggest doing because they were packed! Luckily they were able to fit us in.   We started with some drinks, Sarah and I went with the Uptown Girl. We both loved it! The boys had beers. Then to share, we went with the Crispy Confit Duck Wings and Fried Cajun Oysters. They were both very tasty, however, when you split with three other people, you only get like one duck wing and a fried oyster or two. I wish there was a little more to go around!  For the entrees I ordered the Southern Fried Picnic Chicken, which the server told me was a hit and a favorite. He was right. It was SO freakin' good. It was hard to give up a bit for people to try. I highly recommend ordering that. The rest of the table order the Seared Wild Salmon and Miso Vegan Ramen. Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes but were envious of my order. As for the sides, we got some Hand Cut Fries, Crispy Cauliflower, and Charred Shishitos. All turned out yummy!  I'll be headed back in the future, hopefully to try out their happy hour!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's perfect for date night or with a group of friends. Everything I've tried so far has been delicious and impeccably prepared. We had the fried oysters, bistro steak, and ramen tonight. It was all so good! I'm a steak snob and was completely impressed. Such a great alternative to an over priced steak house if you're in the mood for it but don't want to break the bank. The ramen was also killer, I highly recommend it. The service here is always top notch (except for the hostess who clearly didn't want to be there tonight, or is just too cool to smile). However, the bartender, Matt, was awesome and made our experience extra enjoyable."}
{"text":"What a cute little spot to eat dinner! We decided to try The Upton our first night in Scottsdale, and it definitely set the standards high for the rest of our meals!! For an appetizer, we ordered Bao buns off the happy hour menu. You get one per order with this deal...I got \"The Colonel\" (which originally they said they were out of the fried chicken but then came back to say they had it--and after eating it, I was so thankful they did!!) and my husband for the \"Momofuku\" and \"Seoul Satisfaction.\" The coating on my chicken was so tasty--perfectly crunchy and the chicken was extremely juicy. We have talked about going back for lunch just to get more of these little sandwiches! For dinner, he ordered the Angus Bistro steak with blue cheese and the hand cut fries. It was cooked to perfection! I ordered the salmon. I also wanted to try the farro salad so started ordering it as a side, and then our kind waiter informed me I could put it under my salmon as part of the meal. I am so happy he suggested that because it was an absolutely perfect combination. I squeezed fresh lemon juice over everything, and I was hooked at my first bite. The salmon was flaky and my first forkful was delicious. The farro salad was an amazing addition to the plate. I hated to take the last bite because I didn't want the meal to end! Overall, this has been my favorite dinner of our entire trip, and we will definitely make another stop the next time we visit!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were out checking out happy hours due to a late dinner reservation elsewhere. We decided to check out the Upton, only to find out we missed happy hour! Tragic... Anyway, the place was hopping and we were lucky to get a couple seats at the bar. We tried a couple cocktails, with mine being the best - it was a light and refreshing drink with cucumber in it... yum. We also tried the ribs - these things were so good! The portion was huge, the flavor was bold and delicious, and the meat was falling off the bone. I wanted to have more food, but couldn't because of our dinner plans. I will definitely return, next time for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute little date spot!   I came here for dinner with a one of my pretty ladies one evening. I ordered the Chinese Ribs, My friend got the southern fried chicken. We also ordered a side of fries to share. Everything was amazing! I really liked the ribs and the seasoning they had on it. The chicken was nice and crispy. I asked for a side of ranch for the fries, and they brought me this siracha ranch sauce which was really good!  I ordered the The cure cocktail, which I wasn't too fond of. My friend ordered the refresher which she thought was a bit strong.   Everything was great, and our server was so hilarious and friendly. I'm just not too fond of their drink menu, and I think their dinner menu has a small selection. However, I would come back though. =)"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place after reading reviews and I was excited when I learned my friends bridal shower brunch would be here. The place itself is beautiful, and when we arrived we were the only customers aside from a few people at the bar, we had an awesome table on the patio in the shade with a fan right behind us, it was comfortable, clean and very relaxing. However, I was completely disappointed in the food, there were literally no other customers, every table was empty and still we waited an ridiculous amount of time for small plates and drinks, the plates were brought out one by one with 20 -30 mins wait in between so we all sat around awkwardly trying to wait for eachother to get food, I almost went inside to ask if everything was ok. The food was hardly worth the wait which was so disappointing. It was a very underwhelming experience for an upscale restaurant. Two stars because the place is gorgeous and our server was nice."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very radiant with old fashioned bulbs strung across a new patio recently built and with a comfortable vibe. The customer service is second to none. We were greatest by one of the owners Peji as we arrived there was no tables however we were seated on lounge couches where we could order drinks and starters and it was very nice. Kevin and Phil worked to cover the extra seating and did a great job. Samantha and Doran also tended to is during the meal and made great recommendations and were great at meeting our needs. I would return for sure."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic spot right in the middle of old town Scottsdale.  The food was great as was the atmosphere on the back patio. There were many interesting menu items, all of which were very, very good.  I shared a number of entrees with friends and so was able to taste the steak, salmon, fried chicken, and pork sandwich.  Everything was very delicious.  I think I'm a little jaded to the prices normally charged in Scottsdale, but the meal here was an insanely good value.  Even the wines were good and priced reasonably.  I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Found this place just by wandering down the street. It's kind of a hidden gem. Gorgeous outdoor seating and a small but substantial menu. All food items are delicious, the staff is friendly, and the drinks are fantastic! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"We ate dinner on the patio here.  They had it nicely cooled with lots of fans and a portable AC.  I thought the decor was very cute and colorful.  The food was okay.  The menu had a lot of trendy stuff on it, like salads in mason jars, ramen, steamed Asian buns.  I ordered the steamed pork buns sandwich.  It was pretty tasty, but also quite small.  My friend ordered the duck wings, which were unique, but they also didn't look very meaty at all.  Overall, we had an enjoyable experience, but I don't feel like I'm dying to return that quickly."}
{"text":"What a great experience for brunch.  Steve and Rachel were amazing with service, and very considerate and professional.  Thank you for a wonderful brunch!"}
{"text":"What an incredible find.  The menu was unique, adventurous, varied and affordable.  There even is a happy hour from 4-6. Portions are large but still everything comes out looking aesthetically pleasing. This is a intimate hip cool neighborhood place with a nice patio in back.  Service was top-notch (and this is coming from a New Yorker and Londoner so that's saying something)! If this neighborhood restaurant was in an actual  real neighborhood in maybe San Francisco, Boston or New York you wouldn't be able to get in.  Go now before they get too well-known."}
{"text":"Another situation in which I truly wish there was a half star to throw into my rating. This is a very positive 3.5 star experience for me. While I've had some tasty things here, there hasn't been anything that's truly made me feel like whipping out a bunch of exclamation points or pull on the sleeves of all my friends demanding they try a bite here.   The food is pretty good, and I do like the presence of healthier, lighter choices at a price that won't break the bank. The Italian Burrata appetizer was alright, though the bread was super hard and the relish wasn't that creative. The Mussels we had last night were very...how shall I say...fishy. As in, the \"broth\" tasted kind of like how a seaweed-ridden beach smells. Generally, the less \"fishy\" something tastes, the fresher it is. The black bean spread on the accompanying sourdough didn't to jive well for me at all - it seemed like an unnecessary flavor intrusion when a good crusty piece of bread might compliment what you're trying to achieve by developing a nice broth. The vegan noodles were tasty and light, not too salty. I also really enjoyed the salmon and kale salad. The kale was perfectly tender, as was the salmon, and the dressing wasn't overpowering. I tried 2 different cocktails and wasn't blown away, so I stuck with wine on my latest visit.   The servers and bartenders have always been very friendly. The atmosphere outside is very quaint and welcoming, but the inside doesn't have much of a personality to it. It's kind of how I feel about the menu - not really sure what the objective is from a flavor or ambience standpoint. I want to like it here with it's great location and setting away from the craziness. It's a cute little enclave and priced just right. For how charming and inviting the exterior is, there isn't much character that really draws me in. I will probably be back and will be eager to see how the menu continues to rotate in hopes that some of the food makes a little more sense."}
{"text":"I ate here on Fri Feb 6, 2015 with 7 other people for dinner, only because I read the high reviews.  I ordered the fried chicken.  I don't eat white meat but was told by the waiter that if I wanted all dark meat pieces, the one piece that is white meat (half a chicken breast) would cost $8 MORE to change to dark meat, so I accepted the half breast.  Even the chicken breast was tender inside but the outside was very course and crispy, parts of almost \"break your teeth\" hard, and substantially breaded, like KFC's crispy coating chicken.   Lady sitting next to me also ordered the chicken.  We both did not get any \"honey\" with our chicken.  We both agreed the fried chicken was nothing special and I told her I felt more tender and succulent chicken, cheaper, and more flavorful coating could be had at KFC.  She added \"And we could buy a bucket and half for the same price as 3 pieces of chicken \"ala carte\" at The Upton.  I did not like the cornbread \"cookie\" either, it was quite rubbery and doughy, until I took it home and put it in my toaster oven.  Only thing I liked was the very thin pickle slices at the bottom of my plate.    They had cloth napkins, you know the kind that is only for covering your lap, not for greasy fried chicken fingers..  I wanted paper napkins, so I don't get the oils on the cloth one which would get oils on my nice easter dress.  Waiter only gave me two small cocktail paper napkins.  I said \"That's ALL?\"   He said \"they did not have anymore, kinda out of stock, have to order more.\".    Another person ordered the pork tacos, he said the tacos were \"just OK....\"  Another person had a sandwich, said it was nothing to write home about.   The only person who really seemed to like their dinner was the hostess or organized and picked this restaurant, which she got off Open Table site as accepting reservations for a party of our size.  She ordered the salmon and sugar snap peas with sweet ginger chili.  The peas were delicious and was the only thing that everyone agreed was good!  I did not try her salmon.    I also shared an order of the duck wings because me and the lady I invited both love duck (best duck is at Best Hong Kong Dining).  They were just what another reviewer said, just chewy sinewy skin, and no meat.  It was kinda stinky too, as duck wings can be, cos I have had Chinese style duck wings.  I felt like it was one of those doggy rawhide chews, that you had to grab hard and pull the leathery and dry skin off them.  Furthermore there were only 4 wings for the $9 appetizer order.  Very skimpy and nothing to eat.  The person I shared them with didn't even want her two wings, cos they were not good enough to eat up her share.  I should have asked the waiter if this is the way the wings are, but he was just WAY too busy.  We sat outdoors.   Heaters were not needed, but the patio was very very dim, could not read the menu.  Only one string of small lights for the across the patio.   We had to pass around someone's penlight to take turn reading our menus.  Patio was also very noisy.  Tables were very small too small in width to seat two \"typical Americans\" who tend to be BIG.  I mean one person would have to sorta sit at the corner of the table.  The width of the table would fit two Vietnamese people comfortably but owners should have tried the tables out for typical overweight Americans before buying them for this restaurant.    The service was very good, I'd say 4 stars.  They were almost too busy to ask, and you had to keep waiving your arms to flag the waiters down, but when you did, at least they were friendly, upbeat, and courteous.  And, it did not take unreasonably long for us to get our food, even though the restaurant was packed.  Acceptable service, otherwise I think the rating would get a 1 star.  If we liked the food, we would have posted another excursion on our foodie MeetUp, but except for the lady who ordered the salmon, we all discussed and agreed that \"we were NOT coming back\" to the Upton."}
