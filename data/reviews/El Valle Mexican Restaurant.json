{"text":"good service, friendly environment, good food.  it's more tex mex. not authentic mexican food. the wings however were terrible. it tasted like it was ketchup based, not hot sauces at all."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for lunch today and it was delicious. I had a hard time deciding what to order because they had so many dishes that sounded good. I can't wait to go back and try something else. Great service, great food and great prices!!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Mexican restaurant we have ever been to. We go there at least once a week. Service is always excellent, as well as the quality of the meals. This restaurant is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We love Mexican food and this is our number one go-to Mexican restaurant.  Waiters are attentive and pleasant.  Food is plentiful and served hot.  It is very good.  I don't usually write reviews, but had to leave one when I saw the comments about \" average fare\". They have great chicken-- pulled breast meat.  They have great fajitas and burrito grande.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I work down the road from El Valle and have been eating here for years now. It is consistently awesome food. I'm a huge Mexican food fan and have eaten it all over the country and this type of Mexican is my absolute favorite. I love the beef nachos and get them regularly, but I don't think I've ordered anything from here that I didn't like. It doesn't look like much from the street, but DON'T LET THAT FOOL YOU! This place is a gem! The prices are great and I highly recommend it over any other nearby Mexican restaurants!"}
{"text":"Food was just...ok. Didn't taste bad but not good enough to make me want to come back again. Staff was very courteous."}
{"text":"Go here all the time best Mexican in town. Service is great and food is never bad its always hot and ready ."}
{"text":"Not really popping on a Saturday night, very surprising. Clean and attentive staff. Was just ok for me considering we eat out in Charlotte a lot but are trying more local closer to home. Disappointed that they did not have regular pinto beans although it was on the menu and did not have plain old regular oil and vinegar for the salad. Both platters had so so so much iceberg lettuce on them the rice was hidden under it therefore made the rice cold. The fried tilapia was way over cooked that the bones were edible. Some say it's good but sorry that wasn't my experience."}
{"text":"The food has always been pretty good, bush lights are always a dollar. I eat there maybe once or twice a month and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Wife and I have been coming here every Wednesday for the last several years. Carmelo and Eduardo know us by heart and always bring us my Giant iced half and half tea and the wife's Pi√±a Mexican soda. I really enjoy being able to enjoy my chips and queso dip for a little while before having to order and these guys know my routine. Eduardo always makes sure to bring my special hot sauce to the table \"homemade roasted chilies\". Pollo con Crema is my stand by but anything with grilled chicken is usually the winner for me. I don't think there is anything I can say negative about the place except the AWFUL \"convenience store\" that opened next door. Usually attracts the type of kids/adults that make you wanna lock your doors even if you can see your vehicle from inside the eatery...."}
{"text":"This place looks like a whole in the wall but Very good food, very good atmosphere, very good service. Waiters were very attentive and funny. So far my favorite mexican restaurant in charlotte. My family is from the west coast and this is the closest taste to it. The one thing I can't get use to is all mexican restaurants in charlotte use ground beef instead of shredded beef. Because of that I gave them 4 stars. Please make it an option even if its at a higher cost.. It really makes a difference. Overall great place."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant last week for lunch with two other friends. We only had an hour for lunch and that was plenty of time! Our food came out quickly and hot. I ordered the arroz con crema. It was soooo delicious.  The servers were also very friendly and attentive.  One of my new favorite Mexican Restaurants. I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Got carnitas.. good food, large portions.. service was o.k.  I wish it was more authentic.. I'm use to L.A. authentic mexican food..  looking for homemade salsa, mexican cheese and handmade tortillas!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service and the prices are very nice as well.  Chips and salsa are on the table immediately, drinks never go empty, and they are very accommodating to special requests (my wife likes no beans and no guac, I love it, so they put it on my plate).  Highly recommended and way better than any of those \"chain\" places which are just fast food in disguise."}
{"text":"This is my hubby and I's favorite Mexican restaurant in the area.  I love the Enchiladas Rancheras and he eats the Polla con Crema.  Awesome size portions and great chips and salsa.  Service is good and once your a regular, they love ya!"}
{"text":"Great food, large portions, very reasonable prices. Will be going back without a doubt"}
{"text":"Not a place I'll ever crave a meal from. Service was a bit slug-like, but the location was convenient. This place serves its purpose, I suppose; it's just nothing special."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch during a family weekend afternoon out and about.  Lunch menu was very affordable and had lots of choices of the usual american-mexican fare.  Eveyone enjoyed their food ... nothing mind-blowing, but it was good for what it was.  Service was very good (though the place was very quiet that day, so there was no excuse for it to be otherwise)."}
{"text":"The food and service used to be good. Waiter forgot the drinks, and then forgot to put in our food order. When we finally got the food, the orders were completely wrong. Dirty dishes were never picked up of the table, and we had to go to the bar to get silverware. To top things off, they didn't comp anything on the bill. Don't see us going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic food for the price and service. The combo is very tasty and fulfilling. The beer is cold and served quick as u could ask. Chips are on point."}
{"text":"Americanized Mexican food for Gaston county. In other words bland. 1st warning sign is that the food came out 5 min after ordering. It seems my tamales were made a few hours before as the were very dry and the chicken was microwaved as it was very rubbery. The plate was covered in lots of lettuce and diced tomatoes along with sour cream all of which was fresh. But for some reason all of that was sitting on top of chips, cheese and ground beef. It's like they had an order of loaded nachos and added my tamales.  My rule of thumb is if you can make it at home then no need to return to the restaurant. I will not be returning.  2 entrees and 2 iced teas for 24$. 2 stars.  Service was ok, not bad but not great."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times but today wasn't the best.. The other few times the food was amazing. So not sure what happened this time. But I am sure we will give it another shot again. The salsa is really good which we like!!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back! Tucked away in Matthews, it's not much from the outside- but after getting mediocre & overpriced mexican at mi Pueblo too many times we just had to try somewhere else. Drinks&food are very affordable and, most importantly, delicious! I get Chile rellenos EVERYWHERE and am often disappointed- but these were authentic and amazing. Margarita with Cuervo gold (no gross aristocrat) made with homemade mix (no gross bottled mix) was only $4.75!!!! I'm in love, I'll be back ASAP. I really don't want too many people to find this hidden gem, lol, but it was too good not to help them out by giving them a great review ;)"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Used to always go to the one in Matthews, but this location is closer to my home. As a SoCal native, the struggle was REAL trying to find Mexican food that tasted like home. After a 3 year search, we finally found El Valle. Staff is always wonderful, food is fantastic, atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Great local joint! The ACP is great and the salsa is also very good. Been going here for years in Matthews and it's some good Mexican at a good price."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely average.  The service is not quite that good.  But it is one of those places that distributes buy one/get one style coupons.  If you have a coupon....what the heck."}
{"text":"Great service and food. I was not disappointed! Better than the other Mexican option in Mint Hill - hands down."}
{"text":"El Valle has the best food ever. Highly recommend the pollo la creme it gives your mouth all the flavors of true Mexican food. The waiters treat you with the upmost respect. The waiters often like to be funny and joke around a little."}
{"text":"We returned to El Valle for dinner with some friends, after not having returned for -- yikes!! -- 7 years.  I must give El Valle kudos and a higher rating this time around, as we had an exceptional experience.  I honestly couldn't remember our last visit, but I'm glad we returned.    The menu is quite extensive.  It took awhile to review it entirely.  And I found a lot of different choices than a lot of Mexican restaurants offer, which was a nice surprise.  All at fantastic prices, with an average of about $10 a person.  I finally decided on Camarones El Loco, which is described as \"shrimp in a special burning hot chipotle sauce, served with rice and beans.\"  What intrigued me most was the \"burning hot\" sauce.  While it didn't seem \"burning hot\" to me (sadly), it certainly was delicious and came with a lot of shrimp.  It was a creamy sauce without much kick.  Bonus: all the sauce doubled as a sauce for the rice.  I didn't even use the tortillas that were brought with the meal; it was all good and filling on its own.  One of our friends ordered one of the soups that she's ordered before, proclaiming its size enormous.  She ordered the small bowl, which is much bigger than other restaurants' small size.  And she was right.  It was a huge-portioned, very chunky soup, stuffed with a lot of goodness.  It's a meal in itself.  We all left the restaurant fat and happy.  My opinion of El Valle has been changed...for the better!  They have fantastic food at excellent prices.  (TIP: When you're done at El Valle, sneak around behind the building and discover Artisen, which serves Ecuadorian gelato for dessert.  YUM!)"}
{"text":"Food was fine, menu is very much designed for the people that live here, NOT for those who have lived or worked in Mexico. Surprised that when I asked for cilantro, cebolla (onion) and jalape√±o for my caldo de pollo (hearty chicken soup, which was good by the way ) I got charged almost four dollars extra when I got the bill! To top it off, they also charged me extra for tortillas- after living and working in Latin America and eating in numerous Mexican restaurants in LA, NY, Chicago, San Diego etc that was a first. Probably won't return, but that doesn't mean that you won't like it! Buen Provecho."}
{"text":"I'll be coming back here for sure! The extensive menu made picking a single dinner a struggle.  The food and drinks were delicious (I had the jumbo lime margarita and the Chori Pollo...the margaritas got in the way of getting a good picture). Great specials and atmosphere. Bonus:  The staff really gets excited for birthdays.  Photo credit Jose Cuervo."}
{"text":"The waiter is so funny and we took a photo together and I got the Mexico flag it's pretty i has bean chicken beefI love the chicken one best . And we had a great fun over there and it's not that expensive it's a good place to sent with family and have dinner"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch about a week and a half ago and I kept putting my review off because i wasn't to sure how I felt about this place...  I had the Shrimp Fajitas they were a large portion and were served with rice and beans. Both the rice and beans were pretty gross nothing like I've ever experienced at a Mexican place :(  the beans left this gross after taste in my mouth and the rice just was blah!   The service was weird they sat us right away and got us drinks right away, but when it came to taking our order they were no where to be found!   All in all it was ok nothing special..."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is good and authentic. The staff there is very friendly. We never wait long to be seated or served and the waiters and waitresses are very attentive but not overly so."}
{"text":"nice people and great food, reasonable prices. the waiter even gave me a little homemade salsa to take home! really thoughtful!"}
{"text":"This is our local, 2nd family, authentic Mexican spot. El Valle holds a special place in our hearts, we have no local family and come here often enough they know us, our kids, our friends that visit and give us hugs, jokes and good cheers.  Grilled chicken nachos is our favorite, but you can't go wrong.  Frozen Rita's are a must.  Make sure to tell them it's your birthday!"}
{"text":"Love the two burritos. One chickens and one beef topped with lettuce and tomato. I sub the sour cream with queso on top for extra."}
{"text":"It's good to have another choice of Mexican Restaurant in Mint Hill, place is decent and clean. Servers are friendly and fast. Authentic Mexican, portions are appropriate for the price. Will go back to try other menus. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was a bit unsure of what to expect, since I saw reviews all over the map of this place. However, I was in the mood for Mexican, and this place was convenient since I was in the neighborhood around lunch-time.    When I arrived - between 1 - 1:30 on a weekday, I was seated immediately.  There were a few other tables with patrons so I wasn't the only person there at the time.   The service was pretty quick and menu offered all the standard options on a Tex-Mex menu.  Chips and salsa were brought out immediately and the chips were good, but the salsa was rather bland.  I had to ask for the spicy sauce to pep it up a bit.   For my lunch, I decided to go with the Pollo Fundido, and I must say it was one of the better ones that I have ever eaten.  The deep-fried tortilla was nice and crispy, and it was filled with plenty of pulled chicken and covered in a creamy-cheesy sauce.  It was served with a side of rice.   I was happy with the meal and my service was good.  Also, I don't normally order soda, but since they had Mexican Coca-Cola, I ordered one of those. They taste so much better when they are made with real sugar instead of the icky corn syrup that sweetens American sodas!   All in all, I was rather pleased with my visit and if I happen to be back in downtown Matthews with a hankering for Mexican, I will definitely stop back in!"}
{"text":"Went there last night.  Her meal was great - Pollo con Crema.  My meal was below par - Yolandas (enchiladas).  Cool paint on the walls and food came quick.  Had to wait for the bill.  Gets 3 stars because of the Pollo con Crema."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever dining there tonight with my husband and daughter.  We live 5 minutes from this restaurant and will never go there again.  They have messed up our order on several occasions and same issue tonight.  I ordered a grilled chicken salad and the waitress said you want a taco salad and I said no just the grilled chicken salad and even pointed to it on the menu and she looked down at the menu with me.  Of course when it came out it was a taco salad.  When we called her over to point out the mistake she argued with me about what I ordered and even went so far as to tell me she would fix me something else but that was what I had ordered.  My husband even spoke up and said no that is not what she ordered.  I finally just told her to take it back.  My husband asked for the check and when she came back she continued to insist she didn't make a mistake and be argumentative with me.  She said well I didn't charge you for it and my husband and I both said well we had no intention of paying for it since we sent it back and did not order anything else.  We asked to speak to the manager and she said there was no manger.  Completely disappointed in the poor customer service and we won't return there again.  Their food is just ok anyway it is just convenient for us and did go there routinely."}
{"text":"Food was somewhere between alright and good here.  Nothing special about the salsas, the beans or the rice, and the meat was kind of chewy and bland.  Guacamole seems like it's premade/canned as well, which is kind of unusual at a sitdown Mexican Restaurant. Tastes alright, and is reasonably priced, but this is a classic case of you get what you pay for.  Spend a few extra bucks and go somewhere more authentic."}
{"text":"Good local spot for Mexican food. The service is usually prompt and friendly.  Menu has standard dishes. A plus is the dishes are seasoned well.   This place has changed over the years but all in all good local spot. In my opinion, a little pricey but again it's very local- no long drive for me.   I always find myself migrating back here.   PS.... I believe it's the gorgeous murals on the walls :)"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the Charlotte area. They have had excellent food and service for 8 years and continue to be a weekly tradition. The outside of the restaurant is daunting but it has a friendly atmosphere and the best Mexican food in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time with the family. Loved our entrees (Chimichaga and Enchilada), Queso was perfect and we had a fabulous server. Food came out extremely fast, but we didn't get water refills and had to wait awhile to get our check. The appetizer chicken nachos were ordered for a kid and weren't great so we left them. The four star is for the lack of attentiveness, especially at the end but we will definitely be back. The prices were extremely reasonable and it was perfect a perfect, family friendly place."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been eating at El Valle for years and went at least once per month, using a coupon over half of the time.  My husband usually chooses from the combination plates and I get a large sopa de pollo, big enough for two meals for me and priced about $7.00.  There has NEVER been a problem using a coupon for the soup as it is large enough for an entr√©e and certainly too big to be considered an appetizer.  Last night we placed our usual order; however, when we went to pay, we were told that the coupon was not good for the soup.  When we explained that it has always been accepted, the manager was sent to our table.  He was arrogant to say the least and just short of rude.  He said that the coupon is never accepted for the soup, that he didn't \"know who we talked to\" and that he is \"the only one who can make that decision\".  As I said, we've been using the coupon for the soup for a long, long time and it has never been questioned by any of the wait staff.  He only wanted to talk with my husband and did not want to make eye contact with me.  I told him we would pay for the soup but we would not be back - the cost of the soup is minimal but his attitude was inexcusable.  What ever happened to the customer being right?  He should have offered to accept the coupon this time but explain that it wouldn't be honored again for soup.  In fact, my husband suggested that, and he refused emphatically.  I don't think he realized that he was running off long standing and loyal customers.  Even though I think the food is just adequate (with the exception of the soup), the staff has always been polite, the margaritas are good  and it has been my husband's favorite Tex-Mex restaurant.  We live in the Cotswold area so it takes us about fifteen minutes to drive - longer in late afternoon traffic.  We will miss going there but we would rather spend our money (with or without coupons) somewhere where we are treated with respect."}
{"text":"This understated gem is my favorite Mexican restaurant (by far) in Charlotte and one of the area's top 5 of any kind. The service and the food are consistently phenomenal. The Pollo San Jose is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"Huge menu with so many offerings!  Well priced margaritas, cute decor and ambiance inside, portions enough to make two meals out of and warm chips with salsa! We will definitely return to try other menu options and marg flavors! Service was great and super friendly, too."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. This place never disappoints. Friendly staff and great food. Being Mexican myself this place hits the spot woth the carne asada plate."}
{"text":"El Valle is an awesome addition to Mint Hill especially for the Mexican food lovers like me. The upgrades they made to the ambiance are impressive, very stylish and welcoming, we were greeted and seated very quickly and graciously. Our server came over immediately and got us a high chair and took our drink order and gave us time to look at the menu, the menu looked like most Mexican restaurants fair they do have authentic tacos my niece ordered and loved. We ordered the fresh guacamole there was so much in the bowl we barely put a dent in it, it was delicious. I had the El pollo loco which is grilled chicken with zucchini, onion, and mushrooms very good. It was served with rice and let me just say as a Spanish rice connoisseur, this stuff was divine, it wasn't dry the seasoning was on point the same goes for the beans they were good!! The chips came out warm and the salsa was fresh and savory. Our server was great, he took care of us made sure our drinks were full and we were completely satisfied. If you want great food and service go visit my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great. Good food for a good price and excellent service. I have been here a lot and have had a good portion of the more traditional dishes and I have never had a bad meal. My favorite is the carnitas, pollo con creama and the fajitas.They have fresh pico salsa and chips and delicious sopapillas for desert all for free. They also have great drinks margaritas, beers, and tequila. They do not have a lot of beer on tap but they do have one of my favorites dos equis and at a great price. I wish they would get Negra Modelo on draft too but this will do."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for Mexican food in Matthews.  Reasonably priced and your typical Mexican food.  I have had better chips, these are just okay.  The salsa is okay, in my opinion it has the perfect spice level, but I understand this varies widely person to person.  We like their bean dip - its refried beans and queso together.  I usually get the arroz con pollo which is grilled chicken strips, mexican rice and queso.  I usually eat this with chips rather than a fork :) .  Service can be slow.  In general when I go to Mexican restaurants the service is slow so I usually expect this."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews from other restaurants  nearby, we chose El Valle Mexican. I'm glad we did, I typically order the same thing at every Mexican restaurant, this place didn't have it on the menu, but I told the waiter and he made it the way I order everywhere else. My husband ordered the ACP, with chicken an cheese and rice. The wait staff was very nice, and helpful. Prices aren't crazy high, they are average. Sweet tea is good(southern style), as well as the chips and salsa( which wasn't very hot). However, it is chilly in the restaurant, if you get cold easy, bring a sweater.  Otherwise, I recommend this restaurant for your Mexican food fix."}
{"text":"Worst service in the area, by far.   Once we were seated, it took the waitress 25 minutes to make her way to our table to take our drink order.  We finally decided to settle up 45 minutes after placing our order.   The food never made it to our table.   I have eaten at this restaurant before and  the service wasn't so bad.   The food is generally pretty good.  If you want to order Chicken, definitely get it shredded."}
{"text":"The food is kinda bland...salsa doesn't have much flavor and the guacamole is just mashed up avocado with a tiny bit of salt. The rice doesn't have much flavor either. The margaritas were good, though!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, service and drink specials. By far the best Mexican type place ive found. The Pollo Con Crema, Chori Pollo and Pollo Fundito are out of this world good. The Parrillida Mexicana fajitas are delicious and impressive(I swear, its gotta be pushing 5lb of food). On weekends the jumbo margaritas are $6 and Dos Equis pitchers are $7. The margaritas are strong and the pitchers are large(64 oz methinks). They bring the glasses with the pitcher out half full of beer to make up for any foam. How cool is that!?  Im definitely a fan. Seriously, for some yummo cheesy food and great drink specials this place rules."}
{"text":"Consistently good Tex-Mex joint in downtown Matthews. Traditional tacos la calle, soft shells with meat, onions and cilantro are my go to here at $2.35 each. Three with no sides are easily plentiful enough to satisfy most appetitites. All combos and specials are very tasty.  Service is reliable and pleasant. Atmosphere is attractive and sanitary rating is consistently high."}
{"text":"Been eating at El Valle for years and it used to be my favorite Mexican around this area. Tonight it was terrible and it appears there's been a big turnover in staff. None of the regulars were there. Service was awful, food was cold and soggy and no one seemed to care. So sad ..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food and great prices. Love this place and there taco grandes!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was awesome.  The food was fantastic and flavorful and the service was outstanding.  Although this was my first visit I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic food!! Very casual dining. Great drink specials. We've gone a few times with a larger group and everyone has always been pleased. Very reasonably priced menu."}
{"text":"Pulling into parking lot, the atmosphere is like growing up in Texas! On Saturday night, the wait was zero at 7:10 pm, but the place was crowded. We were seated w/in 5 minutes. The service was excellent but they forgot one meal at service time. The nachos were a little watery but the salsa was tasty. The pollo con crema was amazing. The pollo fundido was awesome. The beef enchiladas, and burritos tasted exactly alike."}
{"text":"El Valle is one of two local Mexican restaurants that we frequent for a casual meal (the other being Salsa's at Sardis Rd. N).    It is your typical Ameri-Mexican fare, but with affordable prices and an incredible staff.  They are very nice here - aside from one very interesting birthday celebration involving a napkin full of whipped cream in the birthday girl's face (?!?!?!) - which we'll just forget.  I like to pretend it was a cultural difference, or some sort of flirting. ;)  The food is solidly good and the margaritas are always perfect. The atmosphere is VERY casual.   Thanks to Hugo in particular who always makes our time there entertaining!"}
{"text":"My family and I eat here just about once a week.  The staff have become part of our extended family.  The food is always excellent and quick.  Superior and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Food was good and reasonable. Service was very slow. I had the steak burrito. It was big and good. However, don't be in a rush."}
{"text":"A few months after my first visit, I decided to give this place another try. Yes, their menu is quite vast. It is spacious inside. Yes, this is a very popular local place on John street in Matthews. The food is prepared to cater to local palates. Nothing wrong with that. It is what makes them a neighborhood favorite.   Here is the thing with me- I grew up on Mexican food in Chicago, either home cooked, great hole in the wall mom and pop joints, and some time spent in Mexico. My reviews are written from that point of view. Therefore, despite trying different menu items on my second visit, I still stand by my original review.   However, I will change the stars to reflect this restaurant's efforts to serving the locals with what they love and prefer. No more only because our food was still bland, the server would not check to see if we needed refills or anything else, and the final bill was wrong with unnecessary extra charges that should be a part of an authentic Mexican meal.   Overall, you might love this place or not.  By the way....  As adults, we can decide for ourselves what to take away from the reviews left on here. Low star reviews do not stop you from trying out the place for yourself. Opinions will always differ. Just do not be the type of reader who feels the need to send scathing, border line bullying \"compliments\" or \"messages\" to reviewers in response to their authentic experience and opinions left on here. These features on Yelp are designed to foster a sense of community and healthy interactions."}
{"text":"I've been coming to El Valle for years. I love the authentic Mexican food and atmosphere. The prices are very affordable.  There was another brand new Mexican restaurant in Matthews that has since closed.  I went there once.  No comparison.  My daughter loves El Valle also.  The service is great.  They give you free chips and salsa.  The salsa is spicy.  But, they'll give you mild if you ask."}
{"text":"Decided to try out a new mexican place and boy how I wish I hadn't. My chicken burrito was bland and I bite down on two bones. After a few hours I started to get sick and threw up everything I ate as I got food poisoning."}
{"text":"This is your typical Mexican restaurant. You get a lot of food, and the price is what you would expect. They have really good pico that you won't find elsewhere. It has jalape√±o and cucumber, which is unique and tasty. They also have really good spicy salsa."}
{"text":"We came here because we were in the vicinity and Yelp ratings was good. It was just ok. The food is average, menu pretty traditional, but service was good."}
{"text":"Terrible food. I got the cheese enchilada with refried beans and rice along with a margarita. The refried beans were oddly a reddish brown color and were chunky and tasted horrible.The cheese enchilada tasted like it was made from those gross American cheese slices wrapped in plastic. The margaritas were horrible as well. The chips and salsa were the only reason I would give it a one star review. They were good. My husband and I didn't get sick thankfully,but both of  the friends we were with were up all night the day after eating there sick from food poisoning. Def would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The service was awful, we waited for an hour for the waitress to come by our table, and even after we called them over they just turned around and walked away. I told them it was my daughters birthday and they did not do anything, and that would be fine if they didn't do a celebration for the table behind us. The food was sub par and our drinks were never refilled. Don't go!!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Me and my family have been coming here for over 10 years. Food is great and the customer service is even better. Thank you and keep it up. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"A good, down to earth Mexican restaurant with good food, ample portions and great, funny staff. Their lunch specials are slightly smaller portions of evening favorites and come with iced tea for about $5.25. You can't get Cookout for that! If you like spicy, try the Molchajete. It is the most interesting Mexican dish I've ever tried. El Valle is our go to weekly treat."}
{"text":"What can I say, I love this place. Always friendly service. Good chips and salsa. My favorite is the combo plate #9, which comes with an enchilada, a burrito, and a stuffed poblano pepper. So good, and only $7! I'm glad it's pretty much always crowded because hopefully that means they'll be around for many years to come. It so great when you can avoid the chains because you've found an awesome local place!"}
{"text":"Ordered a fajati for two and when we got our dish there was a baby spoon size amount of guacamole on the dish, when I asked the waiter politely if I can have just a little more, he responded by saying that's all they give otherwise you have to pay for more. Really???? Really ???? Are you kidding . You are supposed to please the customer, Have been going there for years and it was my birthday and I was so happy to go there, I should have gone somewhere else to be treated that way, sushi might have been a better choice"}
{"text":"The service was fine but the food was quite frankly disappointing. I guess I had higher hopes in the fact that Mint Hill has so few restaurants to begin with.   Like the other Mexican restaurant in Mint Hill the food was bland and unexciting . It is your typical Americanized Mexican place ."}
{"text":"We came on cinco de mayo, busy as heck but these guys killed it!  They were very attentive and the food came put perfect!  I ordered the fajita el Valle and left fuller than full.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the salt on the rim of my margarita.  It was mixed with citric acid, I think, making it super sour.  Other than that A+"}
{"text":"the food is good and the staff is incredibly friendly.  great value makes it well worth going back multiple times!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough... we go at least a few times a month.. chips and salsa are awesome!!! Peach margarita is heavenly!!!!! ACP is yummy.. they give u lots of food, I usually have to take most of it home..."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant numerous times and have always had a great experience. However tonight I had A terrible experience. It took a very long time for us to receive our food and then when we asked for our checks I received my bill and the total was around $12 however when he returned with my card after already running it my bill was changed to $21. We gathered that apparently they had forgotten to charge us for the cheese dip however instead of communicating with us this they just change my bill and ran my card without my permission. In my opinion this is terrible customer service and very unethical. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been going here for over 15 years and the high quality and affordability of the food has not wavered."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots in Mount holly! Always great service and the food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"They have been working on this place for a looong time, and it is definitely a welcome addition to Mint Hill. While there are a couple of other Mexican places, it's nice to have the choice, and El Valle is a good one.  While they did not take the entire space formerly occupied here, the other half(ish) of the building is currently unused, so if they should take off, it is conceivable that they could expand into that space if they should need it - good to see that they are only taking what they need for now, since it makes it more likely that they won't be likely to head out in a week when they bit off more than they chew.  Anyway, onto the restaurant itself. One thing about most Mexican spaces is that they have vibrant colors, and on that item alone, this incarnation of El Valle is a bit disappointing. In fact, it makes you wonder just why it took them so long to open up (I get that permits and such can take a while). Other than adding some lights - definitely needed, as the old space was really dark - and some booths and TVs, it's not a lot different than what was here prior.  The floors appear to be painted concrete. There is little to liven up the space and give you that feel most are probably used to, when it comes to the building itself. Luckily, the staff is very friendly all around. That alone makes a huge difference.   When it comes to the food, it's spot on, even though they just opened. Sometimes new places have a difficult time getting up to speed, but they are doing well on this front. All are welcoming, and though they are a bit on the slow side, I'm sure they will work that out, and their enthusiasm more than makes up for it. Great to have them finally be a part of the community."}
{"text":"Apparently El Valle is known less for their fare (general Americanized Mexican) than the fact that they distribute coupons - ours came from Time Warner, which I believe are offered in conjunction with the folks who put out the big book of coupons for various locations around the city.  Nonetheless, whatever gets people in the door, right?  As has been mentioned previously, the portions are large and the food isn't particularly remarkable, but it's not bad - especially if you do have one of the aforementioned coupons.  Unlike some places when you use the coupon, they are happy to have you as a customer, and don't fret and fume when you use it, which is a nice change from many places.  In my book, that means that service is good.  They also kept the chip baskets and drinks full throughout our visit - something that even places that don't offer coupons won't do.  Sure, it would be nice if the food was better - but it's not the worst in town by a long shot, and if you get a bargain in the process?  Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Ohhhh man those burritos are huge! Then you drizzle the the cheese over it! Yeah it is as good as it sounds, probably better. The unlimited chips and salsa is always a nice touch as well. Basically if you are in the mood for some good Mexican food and A LOT of it. This is your spot!"}
{"text":"I'm a very picky eater and not a huge fan of Americanized Mexican food. This place is consistently the best. They have expanded over the Charlotte, Monroe & Matthews areas - and for once, this is a great thing. I love their simple tacos on a soft shell. Everything is so fresh and tasty, with fresh cilantro, crisp onions, perfectly seasoned chicken, pork or beef & great salsa. The staff is fine - not overly attentive and occasionally I've had to wait on the bill longer than I prefer but for the price and quality, I can't complain. That's more to give a truly honest opinion. Overall, it's the best Mexican food in Charlotte and most especially, Matthews. I eat here around once a week and haven't been disappointed. Don't expect fancy, just good food at a very nice price!"}
{"text":"Weak. Came her with some friends one night in search of authentic tacos and margaritas. Left in disappointment. Ordered a half pitcher of margarita and food. Chips were cold (not unusual for Mexican places, I know) we received a full pitcher or martgarita and I brought it to the attention of the waitress. Tacos were okay. Al pastor was super dry. Only drank half the pitcher. Was charged the full pitcher price. Will not be back. Go to Azteca it's worth the 4 minute drive"}
{"text":"We went about 3:15 and missed lunch, but it was absolutely awesome.  The best we have found since moving to Charlotte 4 months ago.  Food was somewhat slow coming out but worth the wait. We will be making this our family Mexican Restaurant to eat when we go out."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, but I had the worst service I have ever experienced at this restaurant yesterday. They messed up all three of our entrees and two of the three drinks. In spite of this, when we mentioned the mixed up entrees (we let the drinks slide), they were extremely rude. I say they because all three people who served our table were rude. One man actually rolled his eyes at me when I pointed out that my \"vegetarian\" burrito had chicken in it! Unbelievable. I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, and the service was excellent!  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Our shrimp and al pastor tacos were delicious!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much your average Mexican restaurant. Not spectacular however not horrible either. Food tasted flavorful but didn't taste very fresh. Also, I wasn't impressed at the fact that the waiter practically rushed us through our meal when it wasn't close to closing time nor were they very busy. It isn't my first choice."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte.  The shrimp soup is amazing, bursting with flavor.  Friendly, attentive staff."}
{"text":"Went for supper.  Place was not crowded, maybe 4 other tables.  Our appetizer was never brought out.   Our waitress took the order and never came back to the table until most were finished with the entrees.  The entrees were brought out separately, with only a party of 3.  Drink glasses were all empty and no one ever offered to refill them.  Again, there were at most 4 other tables there.  The food was nothing special, your basic Mexican menu with the Combo page and a few specials.  If they are going to make it, they should at least try to have decent service."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant a few nights ago & I must say the food was super tasty & yummy! Best Mexican I've had since moving to Charlotte. But I hesitate to give this establishment a 5 star rating because the waiter was alright. He wasn't the best. Also as we was paying the entire staff looked like they never seen a natural hair girl before. Everyone just was starring made me feel a little uncomfortable. I'm use to stares but this one was too much lol. I know Matthews is a small town but your staff needs to get familiar with how other ppl look. That's my two cents."}
{"text":"Prices are good. Food was decent, but not memorable. Chips needed salt and occasionally you'd get a stale one. Service started off good, but quickly deteriorated.  Upon arrival we were promptly seated, and within minutes were brought chips and salsa and asked for drink orders. Drinks brought a few minutes later. We waited a while and finally flagged down someone to order though, and while we were waiting for our food, we finished the basket of chips and both our waters. Eventually the waters were refilled, but more chips were never offered. Our lunch came out - food was hot (temperature) and tasty. No hot sauce on tables though, you have to ask for it. We ran out of water again near the end of the meal, and it was never refilled by the time we finished and went to the front to pay. This was our first time here, and while it's certainly closer than other places, I plan on trying a few more Mexican places before I  try this place again."}
{"text":"I rated El Valle 5 stars when it comes to comparing it to other low key, cheap Mexican restaurants.  It is the best of it's kind in Charlotte.  The margaritas are amazing, and the staff are super friendly.  This is our go-to Mexican restaurant for my friends and I.  I have definitely had better fancy Mexican food, but if you want something quick and easy, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Stopped by El Valle for lunch and was not disappointed.. Carmelo took care of my order and food came out hot and looking good.. Chicken tacos, and enchiladas plate.. Food was seasoned perfectly and was really good.. Service was prompt,professional, and atmosphere was welcoming and quaint... Wasn't too busy and the staff was helpful and even brought over the \"real hot salsa\"!! I smashed the tacos n devoured the enchiladas.. Comfortable seating and the prices are really decent.. If you want to try find authentic Mexican dishes check this place out and don't settle for Taco Bell..."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Great cheap, authentic Mexican food. Specials. Cheese dip is so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Went to El Valle in Mount Holly.  Food was ok, nothing much to speak of.  I went to give my server my digital coupon through the entertainment book application on my phone.  He said that he could not take it and referred me to the manager.  The manager said that he could not take it because their barcode reader was broken and so the owner told them not to take digital coupons.  They said if I printed it out, I could have used it.  I said, \"So YOUR machine is broken, so therefore YOU will not take MY coupon, so I have to pay double what I was expecting?\"  He said, \"Yes, the owner said he doesn't want people using the same coupon over and over.  How do I know that if you use it, you will not just come back in and use it again?\"   I showed him how you can mark redeemed, so that is not possible.  He did not understand and said, no coupon.  So we paid the full bill and they don't have to worry about us ever coming back-  coupon or not!  They need a lesson on customer service."}
{"text":"Tasty Mexican food and friendly service.  Everything we've had here has been good--fajitas, tacos, enchiladas, quesadillas, etc. It's a family-friendly place. It looks a little sketchy on the outside, but inside it's clean and the food is good.  Service is friendly and accommodating. My kids ask to go here anytime we eat out."}
{"text":"The service was impeccable, the chips and salsa were perfect and the sides were fantastic. The main star of our two dishes lacked in flavor. I would come back, but only after receiving suggestions on what menu items are their top sellers."}
{"text":"I have to tell you this is our top five place to eat based on value, food taste and staff. Nothing fancy, daily specials of which mine is the chicken fajita salad in a shell. We always feel at home."}
{"text":"Really, really great food! I ordered the fajita Hawaiiana and it was delicious! The portion was HUGE so I ended up bringing a nice container home that served as lunch for both me and my husband the next day. The shrimp and chicken were tasty and there was a lot of it! They serve horchata!!! I love horchata and theirs was yummy! Perfect amount of cinnamon! Our server was awesome and took great care of us too. Overall we had a very nice experience dining here and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican restaurant! Best chips and salsa, and margaritas. Staff is super friendly and it has never taken long to get an order. The outer appearance does not do this lovely place justice! Everyone should give this place a try at least once!"}
{"text":"My husband and I use Yelp frequently, but we also really love Mexican food and prefer to form our own opinions. I am rating 3 stars because it really is your average Mexican place, as other reviews have stated.  Not the best, but certainly not the worst! Pros: Friendly, attentive staff, slightly spicy salsa (which my husband loves), fluffy rice, piping hot chips, & clean restrooms. Cons:  [As of today: 6/18/16] a 93.5 sanitation grade, small portions of bland queso dip, watered down/weak margaritas, and not-so-fresh guacamole (canned, I'm assuming). Honestly, if it weren't for my husband I would have turned around at the grade alone, but overall it wasn't terrible. Would I recommend to a friend? Probably not. If I were in the area and wanted Mexican food, would I go again? Yeah, probably. After splitting a huge portion of fajitas and a pitcher of margaritas we walked away only paying $33, and for that- who can complain?"}
{"text":"For tasty, quick ,and cheap Mexican food this is the place. There aren't many restaurants in this area, so if we're looking for something close to home that won't take all night or break the bank  El Valle fits the bill.   The servers have always been polite, efficient and accommodating. It surprised me that someone else said that they received terrible service here (FWIW I have never seen any female servers - maybe it was a different restaurant?).   I love their pico that comes with the salsa and chips you get as soon as you're seated, and their pitchers of margaritas are tasty and fairly cheap."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican food restaurants in Charlotte.  The cheese dip is amazing, and very cheap.  The service speed is unreal.  I've waited in longer drive-thru lines.  Food is always out, in no more than 5 minutes after ordering.  I got the #15 combo, but will continue to try every combo each visit."}
{"text":"Affordable, classic Mexican. Nothing fancy, friendly staff. I've been taking my wife here and having business lunches here for 15 years. Never disappointed with the food. Try the lunch fajitas. I like the variety of veggies rather than just the regular peppers and onions."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Food is fresh and timely served. Ambiance is pleasant. Restaurant is well cleaned and bathrooms maintained. We had an enjoyable experience and a delicious dinner. Well done."}
