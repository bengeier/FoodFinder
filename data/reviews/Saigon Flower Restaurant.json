{"text":"This is the worst Chinese food I've ever had. Not to mention the place is very strange inside and poorly run. I ordered takeout last week and when I went in to get it there were no employees to be found and there was a couple making out in one of the booths.   After 10min I literally had to walk back into the kitchen and yell for someone to come help me. They were playing Indiana Jones on the TV very loud and there are stacks of papers, receipts, invoices everywhere. Very unorganized.  The food itself was soggy, bland and saucy. Sweet and sour chicken balls were the only decent item but how hard is it to fry pre cooked/frozen chicken balls.  It terrifies me that this place offers sushi as well.   Just don't go here - you'd be better off at pizza pizza a few doors down (and I strongly dislike Pizza Pizza)."}
{"text":"Spicy tuna, pho with chicken, and taro bubble tea are all delicious!!  Came in with a friend on a Monday afternoon, it was super dead. Just a single woman working and we ordered way too much food.  The woman was happy to make recommendations,  and we had a great time.  Fuck the haters"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food however prices are high considering what you get and the type of food that's served considering what's available elsewhere in Toronto"}
{"text":"THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENT IS CLASSIFIED.  Minute 1: My squad arrives, tired and broken after a tough night. We figure this is our last chance before Dovercourt so we bite the bullet. My forward scout, Cpl Duguay, ducks in for a recon and signals back that it looks safe. We follow.   Minute 2: It's a ghost town. No sign of anyone, friendly or foe. We hear nothing. We say hello. We turn to leave. Half the squad's out of dodge, but two were caught behind by the woman. We took our seats and felt chills in our spines.   Minute 3: Photos of death marches on the walls. We're scared. Lieutenant Walsh is scared out of her wits, whispering prayers to gods that never knew this hellhole existed. My communications officer Kim jokes about an eleven-hundred-hours vodka after receiving a menu. He's told by the lady to wait a minute for her to get a notepad.  Minute 8: The lady returns without a notepad. She asks if we're ready to order. Everyone was paralyzed. She'll come back in a minute.  Minute 10: We decided on safe choices, hoping our plain orders would be enough of a distraction to cover our exit. Vietnamese joint, vermicelli all around. No problem, right? Right? Cpl. Duguay answers his radio and tells a friend we're getting a quick meal at a nice place. How wrong he is, but he lies because he knows we're being observed.  Minute 12: The lady returns and takes our order. I fear for my life as 'To dring?!' bellows from her nasal canal four times.  Minute 14: There's no sound here. It's driving us insane. I head for the door but I can't make it out - there was a flaw in my plan: there was food that I ordered and had not yet paid for or eaten.   Minute 15: The man comes out, with a hunched back and without a word, he shoves onto the table one bowl of vermicelli sauce per each of my squad's members. He shuffles back to the kitchen. There's a reek coming from our sauces, one of sickly sweetness and definite fecal matter. They knew we weren't there to make peace.  Minute 18: The man shambles out again, and though he didn't say a word, his eyes screamed 'Run, run now. Run now for your lives, you young, beautiful people, because I didn't and now I am I. This life was not chosen, but is the remains of what was taken from me by this god forsaken place.' he also brought us our meals. Placed them right in the middle of the table. My people exchanged glances of terrified bewilderment, and routed the food to who ordered it.  Minute 19: We dumped the death-smelling sauce onto our mostly noodles and meagrely meated meals. We began eating. The silence throughout the restaurant punctuated the mashing of teeth onto food. We could hear ourselves in our most primal moments. We were being deconstructed into the base animals we always were. Under my breath, I muttered to the squad that we'll make it out, we'll live, and we'll eat again somewhere where we can't hear our own heartbeats.  Minute 20: Communications officer Kim's eyes perk up. The lady had made her way behind the bar with only him noticing. She turned on the television and it blared a soccer match. In stark contrast to the vacuum silence from a minute ago, I was sure this was meant to disorient us. What was truly unnerving was that we knew she heard us earlier.  Minute 21: A machine in the back begins hissing. This is the gas. This is the end.  Minute 25: We finish the unremarkable meals. We get up to pay, and watch in horror as the lady shoves a fist into an unmarked box. She rifles through it, and I ready my sidearm. Safety off. She turns to us and clumsily drops 4 fortune cookies on the table. We sigh relief and I pay first. Maybe if I can make it for the door while the others are paying - no - no man left behind. That's what they WANT me to do.  Kim begins speaking. He doesn't have their language, but he's local to their continent. I think he's done it. I think he negotiated our freedom. We won!  Minute 32: We're outside. It felt like years had passed. We can breathe again. Kim smiles for the first time in his life as he puts his crumpled fortune into my palm. I unfurl it, read it, and a single tear drops from my weary eyes. \"The best way to destroy your enemy is to turn them into a friend.\"  Food: Entirely average for the price Atmosphere: An awkward ghost town  Service: Not as bad as my dramatization would lead you to believe but just go somewhere else anyways."}
{"text":"Food was subpar but that was pretty much expected. The service was pretty much nonexistent though. I ordered an item and I never received it. I asked about my item and one of the employees told me they will bring it. When we were ready to pay I told them I never received the order and I was loudly embarrassed in-front of the everyone in the restaurant. It was quite embarrassing so I gave the lady enough to cover the cost and quickly scurried out.  Save yourself the trouble and avoid this restaurant at all costs"}
{"text":"Bloody awful.  We saw the place on Restaurant Makeover a few years back.  So we went there.  The problem with the food was apparently that it was bland.  The tv show chef showed her how to cook with flavor.  In other words, at least bust out the salt and pepper.  Well, I guess the girl in the kitchen forgot whatever they showed her.  Our food was so bland, I asked the waitress if she could take my food back into the kitchen and add some cooking oil.  It was awful.  Never went back to the place.  No thanks.  And my date wasn't impressed either."}
{"text":"Decent food, less than half decent service, prices not too bad.  Went there last week with m'lady. I found the food quality to be pretty decent, however the waitress was rather indifferent and seemed to pay more attention to the news on the TV behind the counter than the customers. She seemed to do the bare minimum with assisting customers (at least when it came to us, she seemed to be doing a better job in attempting to assist a customer with a newly pierced lip).  This is most definitely a lower-end place, so considering that, my experience there was half decent at best."}
{"text":"This is my local Chinese-food restaurant. Good solid choice for when I need to quickly satisfy my craving for Chinese fare. The sweet and sour chicken and the pork loo mein are favourites."}
{"text":"Quiet stroll on queen street with a friend and our hunger level going up we opted to eat here.  We were the only customer there so the service was quick and although the menu is messy to look at the options were good.  I ordered some spicy chicken dish with rice. The food came out quick enough but i was left wishing they took the time. The chicken was overcooked and dry and I only ate the stuff out of pure hunger.   Since on this side of Queen Street there are not really many Asian food options, so I can see why this place is still running and I can only guess that during busier times the food is more fresh and tastier."}
{"text":"The most miserable place on earth!  That lady should really just pack it in and give way for somebody new to service the area with their food."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite take away restaurants on Queen West. The menu is expansive and I have yet to have a bad meal at Saigon Flower.   The eat-in experience leaves somethings to be desired. The service is gruff but still worth it for the crispy ginger beef."}
{"text":"Disgusting, not clean.  I ordered no 145 sweet and sour spareribs, it was actually a frozen weird meat in a thick cherry sauce.  I feel sick now.  I also noticed they serve sushi, hahaha, that sounds very risky to me."}
{"text":"Yawn. I'm not sure why this place has been around for so long.  We came here after Vivek's last CMYE for a late, small dinner. We were able to get a booth for 6, which was kind of neat, and all ordered a range of small appetizers or bowls of soup. The food came out really sporadically, even though we all only ordered on thing each.  I ordered the Hot and Sour soup, which was fine, but nothing special. The menu was all over the place, offering Chinese and Vietnamese items, as well as some Canadian items like poutine.  TV was on the Voice, then Chinese programming the entire time we were there, which kind of offset the otherwise Restaurant Makeover'd decor.  I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Where to start with Saigon Flower. There are just so many things that went wrong here last night, that in the end it was hilarious. But will never go back.  My general Tso tofu was soggy and bland. My partner ordered the vegetarian noodles but surprise surprise got fried pork which actually smelled like it was rotting. This terrible food took 45 minutes to arrive. Two other groups already left because they couldn't wait any longer. A woman came in for take-out twice in the span of an hour because they had not yet finished her phone order. Then there was the man yelling \"This is madness!\" because the machine declined his credit card three times whereas his bank (on the phone) kept telling him that the payment had successfully processed. And the staff at the restaurant refused to talk to him.  Never seen so much restaurant drama in my life."}
{"text":"I went to the Drake hotel for a poetry slam, as usual.  Then I was like - the weather is so nice and calm and breezy and beautiful, and it is 11 p.m. , what can I eat?   Oh Saigon Flower? sushi and har gow? GREAT.  Anyways - no. I ordered the har gow, Pho, sushi. Fail on all. I felt like I was eating acid and bleach. I dont know how to explain this. The HarGow did NOT have real shrimp in it.  I would never eat here again. It says open till 330 a.m, which is cool for the late night crowd but ...no.  I wish I went to Subway next door."}
{"text":"This place isn't terrible to say the least. I have had a lot worse Chinese food. However it doesn't always blow my socks off. I find the pricing to be fairly cheap seeing as you can get 6 chicken balls, chicken fried rice and an egg roll all for $9.99 and they do serve decent portions. It's usually just my go to place if I am craving Chinese and don't want to walk too far. I do live in the neighborhood just a few blocks away so this place does kill the craving for what it's worth.   The service isn't the friendliest. The lady that works there who everyone speaks of seems to just be in a rush and seems exhausted all the time and a tad rude at times. The TV is always on playing some sort of Asian movie and that is pretty much the soundtrack to your dinner if you opt to dine in. There really are only 3 booths and a couple of tables to sit at. This place is never ever packed but there will occasionally be max 8-10 people sitting there if they are lucky on a Friday evening.   I haven't tried anything other than my regular combo that I order for $9.99 as nothing else seems too appetizing.   If you are in the neighborhood and are craving Chinese..go for it, but as others say..don't break your ankles just to get there as their are several other great places to dine in."}
{"text":"There's a lot of bad reviews for this place and I can see it but I disagree with many and think the food here was actually surprisingly good! I got the shrimp dumplings, Mongolian beef, Viet spring rolls and hot and sour soup and it was all very good. The ambiance is completely lacking and the one lady server was slower than a snail but the food was good enough for me to put up with it. Will come back"}
{"text":"This is actually a 3 1/2 and based on one visit. Not too sure why everyone's b*tching so much but I think it has to do with expectations. This is a place to go if you want some standard Chinese food and that's it. Actually, I thought it was damn good.  I think everyone's problem is mainly the service, ie. the \"one lady\" I keep reading about in the reviews, who I'm assuming is the owner or matriarch of the place or something. This isn't a place you go to for \"steps of service\" or the Saigon Flower \"experience\". It's basically in, menu, food/drink, out - which, from my understanding, is the way it is in a lot of old school Chinese restaurants. Could she be nicer/better? Sure. Maybe she's become used to dealing with drunken Queen West d-bags over the years - I was there real late after work last night and I watched the place explode into a gong show. Then again, they could shut down earlier to avoid all that, or get some new blood in the front of house to help out.  Anyways...  I had the Beef Chow Mein. It came out steaming hot, fresh and was proper. It was a lot of food, too. The plan was to take some home but I ended up killing the whole thing. I even got set up (!) and offered chopsticks when asked. The decor and the overall atmosphere of the place is pretty dope, imo. I've walked by many times at night and been drawn to it. The food is mainly served by the guys in the back, who I'm assuming are the kitchen, and they're all very friendly.  Calm down. There's mad places to go in TO if you wanna be romanced. You don't have to break your ankles to go here but if all you're lookin for is low maintenance and some good Chinese food there's no reason to skip this place. I've seen and had way worse. Peace."}
{"text":"Saigon's got a bad rap, so I thought I'd come here to clear some things up.  The \"matron\" previous reviewers have referred to is a lovely lady named Rose. She has a great sense of humour and stands by her food. She's a no nonsense kind of woman who has been running her business for almost 27 years. I actually only recently learned that this place was on Restaurant Makeover from a drunk girl ordering chicken balls and making all of us laugh, including Rose, with her knowledge of the history of fortune cookie presses.  I admit I haven't tried too much here, but there are two staples I generally fall back on. First, the veggie lo-mein. I always order this by mistake, but am never too disappointed. It features seasoned noodles with lots of bean sprouts and green onions. What I always mean to order is the veggie chow-main. When you order it they ask if you're vegan because the dish is made with chicken broth. If you're vegan they'll do it without, but I like keeping the chicken broth in there for flavour. This dish comes with your standard chinese mixed vegetables. I find it quite tasty, but I also add a few spoonfuls of sweet & sour sauce to my noodles. This makes me happy.   This place is great because it's open super late on weekends. I wouldn't say it's the cheapest, but the portions are generous and you can always get multiple meals out of one order.   The menu is huge and the place is never too busy (most people get their food to go), but the food is consistent and quite tasty! Don't be afraid to give this place a chance."}
{"text":"Spring rolls are tasty. Fresh rolls are alright. I ordered a chicken chop suey, and it was all bean sprouts, no other veggies, and there barely any chicken. I probably I wouldn't order here ever again."}
{"text":"It's tough to describe Saigon Flower, it's an interesting spot. By 'interesting' I mean a few things, depending on the day. On one hand, it's a decent down and dirty Chinese food in area that's got more pizza joints than it does Chinese. The food is okay, but not what you'd call bursting with flavor. When you want a #7 Combo of sweet and sour chicken balls, ribs and fried rice, this'll do just fine. There's nothing really WRONG with the food from here, which is probably not what you're wanting to hear when someone suggests a place to eat. It's a great place for when you're craving the standard for greasy Chinese take out. What's probably most noteworthy about Saigon is the woman who operates the place. She's never been rude to me per se, but she often looks like she'd prefer to be scraping paint off the side of a barn with her fingernails than sitting at the counter taking food orders. I went in about three times in two weeks once and she didn't remember me at all, which is not to say that I feel like I demand to be remembered and it's absurd I wasn't, it's the  way she seemed to take about 1/10 of a second to say she didn't remember me right about four days after I'd been there and we'd had a nice conversation, like you'd expect to be remembered strictly by the lack of time elapsed. Not a big deal, but is funny when you try and be friendly and the person there looks like they're already at home on their sofa watching the shopping channel four hours later. Also, the restaurant itself is ALWAYS empty. Save for one time I walked by and there was 3 people in there, it's ALWAYS empty. Not a good sign.  The prices are pretty decent though and the food generally doesn't take too long.   I'm giving this place an unenthusiastic but still decent 2 stars. Go if you're close, don't break an ankle getting there if you're not."}
{"text":"Just ordered takeout for the first time. We ordered the pad Thai, shrimp cold roll, pork/shrimp spring roll, and the crab maki sushi.   The cold roll was decent but the sauce it came with was absolutely horrible. I switched it out for a spicy Thai sauce I found in my pantry. My Bf had no complaints about the spring roll and said he'd order it again.   However, the pad Thai was awful. It was so bland. It just tasted like chilli hot sauce. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy and have a high spice tolerance but it wasn't advertised as spicy at all. My bf couldn't even eat a bite.  Lastly, the sushi was pretty horrible. We attributed it to the fact that we are use to eating sushi from koji, but I think regardless of our sushi standards this stuff would taste horrible either way.   I wish I read the reviews before wasting $30 on this garbage."}
{"text":"This is the probably worst place that I have ever been to. First, the food had a piece of wood in the food. Second, the food had a rotten smell in it. Third, the restaurant owner asked personal questions. Last, the restaurant was dishonest about their use of your card. If you want to avoid identify theft and humiliation, please avoid this restaurant by all means"}
{"text":"Portions sucks and prices were high.    We ordered fried rice and it was not good at alll.  Its like they put left iver meats and fried it all together.  The fried egg rolls, vietenamese roll and veggie roll is at par but nothing great.  We also ordered sweet and sour shrimps... which was fried battered shrimps served with side of sweet and sour sauce.  Service was quick and the lady was friendly.  If your craving chinese food... and portion/ quality of food is not a big deal... than this place will do the trick as its a step uo from street meat after a night out.... and looking for a place open late."}
{"text":"I'm here right now and the female owner is actually cutting her nails in the service bar area in the main dining room. We just asked her to stop because we're on the verge of throwing up... It's very unhygienic! She obliged. This is sick. Where is the no star option?"}
{"text":"Does anybody work here? Walked in twice and was empty. Called once and said lady on the phone said she wasn't open (it was a weekday night). I'm confused."}
{"text":"Those who has seen my other reviews would know that I have been pretty fair with my reviews, some may say I may even be a tad generous.  This time however, it is not the case.  I was working in the area and had a craving for sushi, and this was the closest sushi place that was in walking distance.  I went online to look at their menu and made a pick up order of a red dragon roll along with some salmon sashimi.  Walked into the place, it was empty, went up to the counter and notice on the display case on the right side were bits and pieces of salmon wrapped in seran wrap.  I was worried that the salmon might be old, but I paid and carried it back to work.  I made sure to smell the salmon just in case and it smelt of lemon. I ignored it and ate a piece. After chewing a few times, I started smelling the fishy smell from my breath, tasting that old fishy taste. Needless to say, I gave up on the sashimi.  I had better hopes for the red dragon roll(after peeling off the salmon) The rice tasted like it was from a day or two ago, the shrimp tempura was stale.  The only thing good in the roll was the avocado.  I won't be returning to this place, and sadly, I would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Oh, late night, alcohol-induced food choices. On a late night, with a fair amount of alcohol involved in the choice, we headed to Saigon Flower for some cheap food. I was starving, I had Beef Pho and an egg roll and I was happy.  Now that I actually look back on the experience at Saigon Flower, it wasn't awful. It's got pretty decor inside, decent service, food came out relatively fast, lots of cheap menu items. This place tries to conquer a couple different kinds of Asian food and some varieties are much better than others (Pho = pass, Pad Thai = fail).   So maybe I wouldn't come here without the alcohol, but it's definitely a good late night joint, especially since it's close to a lot of trendy bars -- the Drake, Stone's Place, Rhino. Plus it's cheap, fast and clean. At 2 am, that's all I really need anyways."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat in Queens West. No service what so ever. When the lady did decide to help she was rude and snobby. The food portions were tiny for what you pay. The actual building is falling apart and against building/ fire codes....."}
