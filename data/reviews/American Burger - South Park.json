{"text":"The food here is awesome the milkshakes are great the restaurant is always clean great place to eat!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!!!

If you're looking for quality food quickly, look no further. My go-to order is always a cheeseburger, onion rings and a milkshake.  For me, it's certainly worth a few extra bucks to get exponential quality over traditional fast food, and the staff is always friendly. 

Come support this place!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to indulge in a Keto friendly meal , if you hold the sides. Had the bun-less turkey burger with guac and a fried egg. Very satisfying and full of flavors!!!!"}
{"text":"American Roadside is trying to be a step above 5 guys with a broader menu, and nicer interior.  but unfortunately, I did not find the burger to be better than 5 guys.
For a side I ordered the 1/2 fries and 1/2 rings combo. What I received was a small basket of fries with 3 onion rings.  Being they were charging as much as a side of onion rings I was expecting a little bit more.  For the same or a little more money I'd go the extra 1/2 mile and eat at Nom Nom Burger."}
{"text":"I had a route 66 burger and my wife had the all American burger.  Although I can not get used to thousand island on a burger you can leave it off. The Burgers were excellent. Fries were ok. Pretty fast Service and friendly staff. It's $ for fast casual. around $12 per person for burgers one side and drink.  all in all I'll definitely be back. Another plus.  They had multiple big screen tv's do it was great to watch college  and it was easy to watch at any point in the restraunt."}
{"text":"I ordered through Door Dash, so this review is based mostly on the food. I thought the burger was very good, but could have used a little more seasoning. On the contrary, fries were a little too salted and good, but I prefer thicker fries. The Mac and Cheese was okay, and I probably wouldn't order it again. Onion rings were awesome. I ordered an Oreo mike shake and requested for them to make with chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla. Not sure why that was worthy of a 50-cent up-charge. Come on...really? It was very good, but the Oreo chunks were just sitting on the bottom and should be mixed in a little. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Not the best I've had.. Solid, and ok for the price and area. I don't even remember what I had to be honest. Considering the high-end restaurants in the vicinity (Ruth's Chris, Del Frisco, Maggiano's), this is definitely more affordable. They do have chocolate soda though! If you want a good burger, go to Cowfish- it's a few more dollars and totally worth it, though the wait could be long."}
{"text":"Decent place for the price in southpark, Wednesday nights $1.50 drafts are nice."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good because it was in walking distance of my house.  Then again, so is the dumpster.  Maybe I'll eat there next time.   Despite the hockey puck sliders, the apparent absence of any management staff and the hair in my burger, I was willing to give it another try until I actually tasted the burger.  If they served a plate full of hair with a little bit of burger in it, I would've enjoyed that more because it would've covered up the taste of the burger.  The staff were friendly for the most part and the add ons were free as someone else pointed out.  But if the essence of four day old pickles and tomato slices gets you going then there are other places you can go for free add ons.  Like the trash.  I wouldn't go back again, but I'm partial.  I have taste buds.  American roadside?  More like American Roadkill."}
{"text":"Yep, the service is really slow. It's not crowded. There are lots of people working, but they just can't seem to get it together. Fortunately we aren't on a schedule, but we are really hungry. Stick to Five Guys everyone."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Looking for a new place to eat at lunch and came across American Burger. The burgers are great and the service was friendly, quick, and did  i mention the burger?! Would really come back and start making this a common lunch stop."}
{"text":"Unremarkable. Burgers were dry. Tater tots were just ok. 
Not worth the money. Service was very good and everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Just walked in on a Saturday night. No line. Great burger selection.  Wait time a little long for an empty night. Delicious burgers. Decor is interesting.    Would return if time no an issue."}
{"text":"I went with a friend yesterday and I had an overlooked hamburger (I was told it had to be cooked well done even though I asked to have it cooked medium-well).  The tator-tots were ok.  The I sweet iced tea tasted like water.  The dessert lugnuts (powdered sugar doughnut holes)  had a bad taste to them.  The only good part was they they were warm.

The manager was running around trying to help people but the food that we had was just not good at all."}
{"text":"So enjoyed our burgers and fried pickles last evening at American Burger Co. uptown. Wonderful food and great drink specials. Our waitress called us by name---what a plus this day and age!!!! Thanks for a fun evening Brandi!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The onion rigs/fries combo is great -- they have excellent onion rings!!  I always get a bacon cheeseburger and it's always great!  The choices of toppings is pretty extensive.  I love that they have chocolate soda there - such a throwback :)"}
{"text":"Great burger. I love the free add-ons....red onions, grilled onions, jalapenos, pickles, relish, etc. Also love the sauce with horseradish (not sure what it is called but it is great!) I wasn't crazy about the onion rings but the fries were pretty good. The staff was great - Friendly and attentive!!!!

I noticed they have a lunch special during the week that seems pretty good and lots of beer specials (didn't have a beer yet!) so I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Our food tasted amazing and telework was nothing wrong with it. I would recommend the fried pickles, if your a pickle lover like I am.  If you are vegetarian like I am, this place will still give you a personalized burger that will make your mouth water. I would say that this is a 100/100 restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been in here numerous times.   One of the best burgers I've had, I forget the name but it was delicious.  Milkshakes are very good as well.   Good service and food all around.   I will be going back!"}
{"text":"3 stars but not a bad 3 stars. It's as advertised. Food is good, service is good, beer is cold. I will return."}
{"text":"We returned to American Roadside, this time on a weeknight when they were busier and with better expectations.  

Although it's mainly a burger joint, I opted to try their popcorn chicken with their Blazin' Hot sauce.  Let me tell you:  it was HOT.  Super hot.  Incredibly spicy.  In other words:  perfect!  And with the full order, you will definitely get \"full.\"  They were reasonably priced, too.  

So because of the better experience (and lowered expectations), I had to give American Roadside another star up from my previous review.  I'm still not crazy about tipping at a \"fast food\" restaurant BEFORE you're even served, though."}
{"text":"Nothing to spectacular. Burger joint on the high end side of town. They have awesome waitresses and great bartenders!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was fun but overall i was disappointed in the food. I had high hopes, the menu sounds great but it didn't meet my expectations. I ordered the Route 66 burger with the Mac & cheese. The burger was ok & the Mac tasted like hospital Mac.  We were excited abt the lug nuts (fried dough dipped in powdered sugar or Cinn/sugar but they were a little tasteless for me. Don't think I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"So good! Apparently they just changed their name/menu so one of the cashiers came around and helped us with navigating it. My boyfriend got the Mac Attack Burger and I made one my own and they both were delicious. The burger was a tad dry but overall it was great! It was reasonably priced and there was barely a wait for our food. I would come back next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Very good burgers to be had at American Roadside. I popped in the other day only because a friend was already enjoying a couple beers here and I'm glad I did! The best thing about this place? Their food is super cheap. I ordered a double cheeseburger (I was starving) and tater tots and a Coke. My entire meal was only about $10. I think the double cheeseburger was around $5 which is such a steal. When I ordered my burger I thought it was fun that you could add whatever you wanted on the burger for no extra charge. The tater tots were heavenly as well.

I sat at the bar because of my friend drinking beers but I think that most people who come in just order at the cash register (think Five Guys) and then sit at a cafe style table and have their burger either brought to them or they pick it up at the front. I was actually waited on at the bar, which I think is out of the norm for this place. 

I devoured my burger and can appreciate a burger that looks like you could have made it at home on the grill. The extra fun toppings only made it that much better. :)
The next time I'm craving a quick and inexpensive burger, I'll be hitting up American Roadside!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? I had high hopes for this place and sadly it did not deliver. My first mistake was ordering the Philly Cheesesteak. I should have known my beloved Philly Cheesesteak was not going to translate well. The \"cheesesteak\" was served on an over sized hot dog bun that was hardly toasted and limp. I ordered the sandwich with lettuce and tomato because that's how we eat them in Northeastern PA. The sandwich was mostly lettuce with VERY little meat and a Provolone cheese that was so strong tasting, it would make you want to slap your mama. The tomatoes were diced so therefore they rolled off the sandwich and ended up in a pile on my plate. My fries were fine. They reminded me of Burger King fries. The kind that have that little extra coating on them. Needless to say I was bummed and thought surely I should have ordered the burger considering that's what they are known for. I tasted my daughters burger and can I tell you I am still tasting it many hours later. It was rather gross. It tasted like meatloaf made with Lipton onion soup mix. Can someone pass me a mint and an antacid please."}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon or Living Social deal when this place first opened - we were excited a burger joint was opening so close to home. Service was friendly and fast.  Decor is nice - there's wood from an old barn, comfortable seating, exposed ceiling.  You order at the counter and food is brought out to your table - think Panera for burgers.

The veggie burger was a frozen patty, I could have done the same thing at home. The real burger looked like a good, greasy burger - probably good for hangovers. Typical sides and milkshakes. It was food, nothing to write home about, but edible, doable food. Dessert was probably the best thing we ordered - little donut holes. 

We went back a second time and everything was the exact same. It's nothing special, but it is really fast. Probably will go again when we're in a hurry, but not really a place to take out of town guests!"}
{"text":"Sorry, it's all about the beef and roll. The hamburger itself was fine, though a bit dry, but the roll was stale and hard. Really? Does this company not understand the importance of a soft/fresh roll with a cheeseburger? Will spend my money elsewhere for a burger. The onions rings were really good."}
{"text":"I'm a musician who recently played here & my brother came in with his girlfriend & ate & they loved it! I got a pimento cheese-bacon burger with fries & a Reese's shake to-go & even though I didn't eat the burger until 2 days later....it was still AMAZING! Wonderful staff as well!!!  Even though they don't have liquor, their draft beers include local breweries & are ice cold & delicious"}
{"text":"I like the food here and the service is usually friendly. But a QC process really needs to be implemented, especially on carry out orders. I have picked up food here several times and each time, something is missing. Today it was the lettuce on my sub, other times it's all the toppings altogether. The receipt clearly shows what I ordered so it's not that I missed something. 
Carry out orders also are in a bag that is stapled shut so for the sake of looking like a total jerk by ripping open my bag at the counter, I'm left to go home and see if I got what I ordered. 
It's such a simple process to fix so hopefully my future orders will be more successful. But beware... That said, the food is good and is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Went once had a decent experience really good burger, ok service. Went back and couldn't even get service they were too busy serving their underage friends beer. I'm not a complainer but I will not be back. Just go to taco Mac it's a block a way and the burgers are just as good and the service is WAY better"}
{"text":"For the price, you might as well go to Cowfish which is nearby. The food here is flavorless and of low quality for the price. The portions are small for the price. I'm going to keep harping on the price, because you'll spend as much at Cowfish or Bad Daddy and get so much more. Even simply comparing the side of tots side by side, American Roadside falls flat and is a much smaller portion.

There's really nothing to say about service since you walk up to the counter, order, and they bring your food to your table. There is very limited interaction with staff.

Parking is easy because this place is never busy.

I've been here twice and there are simply too many better options in Charlotte for burgers, shakes, and tots to waste my money here."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to an American Roadside and they're consistent, however the only reason I went a second time was because I had expired LivingSocial $$ to use up.

I got a normal hamburger for $3.95 and an order of tater tots for around $2.  They were okay - nothing amazing that I'd write home about (but I'll write yelp about it!)

The location was very clean and bright with lots of windows, and lots of tvs.  They do have a bar with a good selection of draught beer, but I honestly don't see myself hanging out at American Roadside in the future."}
{"text":"I had a nice lunch here with a friend and I really enjoyed the customization options. I decided that I would try a burger since that is what they are known for, and I have to say that it was really juicy and cooked perfectly. I got the tater tots as a side and they were extremely fresh which I loved because their is nothing worse that old tater tots, fries, etc. The service was very friendly and attentive as it should have been since they were not very busy at the time that we went in to eat.

It would be nice to have a little more signage to indicate where they are because we almost missed them! 

This was my first time here and I definitely want to go back to try one of those milkshakes."}
{"text":"Food was HOT and my order was on my table in barely 5 minutes after placing the order.  I went at lunch time too. 
Great customer service! Plenty of parking spaces!
I'll definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I prefer consistently mediocre to great one time, bad another. I discovered today that you can't count on American Burger to be good or mediocre. Today my burger was just plain bad. 

With my cholesterol numbers, having a burger is an infrequent treat. I won't forgive them for wasting this one."}
{"text":"Great burgers, fried pickles and onion rings!  Good service.  Good tunes and conveniently located!!!  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Good burgers, a bit costlier but there is good quality to them.  I work within easy walking distance and they are one of my \"order online to bring back to work\" go-to spots.  Their burgers are really good and I'm a huge fan of their tater tots.  They also make good shakes.

Is it the greatest burger?   Probably not.  Its a very high quality burger place that meets the expectations they set, and for that they get my 5 stars."}
{"text":"I went to American Burger with a group of 5 for dinner during the week. There was no wait and plenty of seating. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 Carolina dogs and a large basket of tater tots. The Carolina dog was a Nathan's hot dog with coleslaw and chili. It was delicious, but my favorite was the tater tots. I don't think you can go wrong with tater tots, but these were definitely the best. The rest of the group had a variety of burgers, everyone seemed to enjoy. I say that because all of our plates/baskets were clear by the end of the meal."}
{"text":"I got the hot mess burger. It came with bacon, onions, chipotle sauce, jalepenos, and fries in the burger. It's definitely is a hot mess! A good type of messy  It was20150314_145738.jpg packed with a lot of flavor! Good level of spice. Got a side of Mac and cheese ... Below par!! Mediocre ! Don't waste $3 on Mac n cheese side. Should be 50 cents... I think it's comparable to the one Wendy's had (do they even still have it) but for a different type of burger joint, check this place out."}
{"text":"Despite the less than enticing Yelp reviews, my wife and I found ourselves here for two reasons: Convenience and a BOGO Free coupon. It was early Monday evening and the place was empty when we arrived. We ordered at the counter and were seated in the very comfortably casual dining area with a half dozen or so wide screen TVs prominently displayed. 

We went simple and just ordered a couple of cheeseburgers with fries. They arrived within five minutes and looked tasty; however as a prior butcher, I'm pretty picky about my ground beef. Although supposedly hand-pattied Peruvian ground beef, theirs was not nearly as juicy or satisfying as has some of its competitors namely Burger 21, Smashburger, Bad Daddy's or even 5 Guys. Still, they weren't bad. The toppings were fresh and it came on a brioche bun and at $6.79 they were priced a little cheaper than most.

We got the regular fries and the sweet potato fries. Sweet potato fries were cut a little thicker then I normally like and as a result some were a bit soggy. They did come with a nice sweet and buttery dipping sauce.

Overall sanitary rating was an impressive 99 and service was good, as both manager and a server stop by to check on us. Still, they're just too many at better burger options as far as I'm concerned, yet I would consider returning (but not without a buy-one-get-one-free coupon.)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with kids. Service was fast as you walk up and order then sit down. I was hoping the burgers would be hand made patties but I was disappointed. 

Fries were good but small portions. I would come back and try something different on the menu. Kids loves it and ask to come back all the time."}
{"text":"I have to say I really like how clean and cute this place is, but it is also very efficient. In and out of that line all day long. I'm not big on red meat but the rest of the family loves  burgers and they have other stuff on the menu for me. I am a big fan of the quality control, the price, the food, and the itty bitty made to order doughnuts. Really, really, happy with the fact that my kids enjoyed it and my hubby could grab a beer to keep his sanity before hitting a movie with the kids. No it's not the biggest hugest burger in town, but it's also not a $15 burger and they had tater tots. Made me think of my Nanny and Pacas house. Anyway this is a clean bright place you can take your kids at a reasonable price in Charlotte and you can have a beer or a glass of wine. More family friendly or quick bite for lunchtime."}
{"text":"Very friendly.  Good service.  Very good burger and fries.  4 stars for a sports bar!"}
{"text":"Great Location for the South Park Area!  We ate outside on the umbrella covered deck at nice picnic tables!  The staff were friendly!  You go to the counter place your order, then David brings out  your food!  Very nice!  My burger was fixed just right (as I ordered it) and the flavor does beat many other places!  Great Red Onion on my Burger, though I'm not a fan of Kosher Pickles, on Burgers! 

A la Carte... Nice!  Some people may only want a Burger and not a side of fries!  It seems that they are more specialized : : Burgers and Sandwiches not trying to have a menu that is so wide that they are lacking in making the Burgers well!  I think most people will like this Burger and like the Restaurant!

The Burger was Good as in A -OK three yelp stars Good, maybe a little better when I think of all the Chains that can not make a decent burger!  I thought this burger was even better than some that cost more, though the flavor was three yelp stars compared to the few burgers I rate in the Four or Five Star range!  

The Onion Rings were not my preference, too thickly cut, TOOOOO much Cornmeal and Too much batter!  They did taste Fresh!  If you like this style of Onion Rings you'll like these!  For this kind of Onion Rings I guess these are pretty good, WAY better than many of this variety, only not what I prefer.  

The Sweet Potato Fries were poor and the Regular Fries were the opposite of good!  Huge Disappointments on all sides!  If I let the sides had factored in my yelp star rating of this review the overall rating would drop!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch with my girlfriend after church.  We were starving, so we were both looking forward to a good burger.  While American Burger Company did not disappoint, we both felt like the burgers were good not great.  I tried the Mac Attach. which is a burger with macaroni and cheese on top.  It came with your average sweet potato fries and was a decent size.  A little too cooked for my liking, but I don't think the beef was anything special, so might have been a good thing after all.  Anyway, great spot when you have a burger craving and are looking for something decent quick.  Not the best burgers in Charlotte though."}
{"text":"Take this place for what it is - a quick place to grab a burger and (maybe) a beer. There is nothing gourmet about it, but it definitely is not bad, and it is definitely not expensive. I have been here four times, and will most likely be back in the future. The bartenders I have talked to have always been kind and always make sure to tell you about the drink specials they run every day.

My three recommendations to improving this place:
-Don't overcook the burgers. The burgers are always cooked well done, which I understand is the standard, but it wouldn't hurt to cook them to medium well.
-Improve your water! This is one major sticking point for me. Most days I drink water with lunch, but not here. The water from the soda machine tastes very strange and is something I will avoid in the future.
-Improve food delivery time. I was in an empty restaurant the other day and my food still took close to 20 minutes to reach my table. I have no idea why, but it seems to be a common trend.

I really want this place to be great, and I think it has the potential to be. Should things improve, you will certainly be seeing more of me. I only hope the necessary changes can be made."}
{"text":"We just picked up a to go order & it will probably be our last from this place. The burger and fries were average at best the milkshake was actually pretty good but the salad my wife ordered was disgusting.  The avacados weren't ripe so they were hard & not edible.  The grilled chicken was really fatty & chewy we gave most of it to the dog... Same story with the bacon. The Romaine & Spinach blend she ordered was all Romaine lettuce...  I get it's a burger place but why even have salads on the menu especially for $11.  If I had seen the salad before I left I would have gotten a refund & went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Another great burger joint. Portions are huge and very filling. Fresh and good quality. Tried it on Sunday and got in about 15 minutes before hey we're closing by the time I'd decided what everybody wanted I kept the staff 10 minutes after closing and they seemed to be still as friendly as if I was in during business hours. So thank you to all the ladies that worked this past Sunday evening and were accommodating and friendly. Perfect lunch spot."}
{"text":"We come here often. It use to be great, slacked majorly when they changed menu & seems to have come back. Food tonight was consistent to old burgers we loved. Super friendly staff. You can choose any toppings, basically build your own burger. They have veggie burgers, salads & chicken options as well. You know what your getting here & it's good. Casual, easy place."}
{"text":"Hubby had a mushroom swiss burger which he loved. I wasn't too impressed by the smokey taste of the beef. Although I'm not a vegetarian, I tried the veggie burger, which turned out to be black bean. Realized I'm not a fan. The onion rings were great. The fries, so-so. I was turned off by the Roadstar - their \"signature\" 4 pattie burger they dare people to finish. Does there really need to be something so obviously unhealthy on an American menu? Prices were a little on the high side for a burger, but food is made to order. Service was extremely pleasant and friendly. The sign above the register seriously needs to be raised as we watched the poor, tall employee's head bump into the sharp point on the bottom a couple of times."}
{"text":"I really Liked this Place, Burgers and fries very good and did not cost me an arm and a leg like the gourmet places do, Instead of being mugged by 5 guys, i felt like I was being feed by a local little mom and pop place. 

Lots of toppings to choose from, staff was decent and lots of sports TVs going on.

If you looking for just a Nice Gourmet burger for a decent price, build your own and save the rest of you money for gas! LOL

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have to say I'm a pretty big fan of American Roadside. I have given up red meat but this is one place I really miss. Roadside Rally is my favorite burger on the menu. Great service and decent prices. It's a good place to catch lunch on a workday. The tater tots are deep fried and delicious as well."}
{"text":"Place - cool, biker-like ambiance

Price - a little pricy

Food - average

I had ordered a burger. I asked for extra mushrooms (charge me more, I don't care), got a spoonful - what?! The burger was on the dry side :( 
Loved the lug nuts - donut hole with powdered sugar. It was a nice to end the meal - it took awhile to get it though.

I really want to love this place, but it's hard. I will definitely give this place another shot. The service was nice and people are super friendly. I would avoid the burger and try the Philly cheesesteak, since my hubby liked it."}
{"text":"FOOD:  burgers are tough, dry and fried.  Perhaps their other offerings are better?  The burgers here don't even compare to CowFish, Bad Daddy's ... Or even Five Guys.

SERVICE:  it's basically fast food - stand in line, order, then they bring food to you.  No table service.

LOCATION AND PARKING:  convenient.

I won't bother to go back."}
{"text":"Its your basic, no frills burger joint. Service-meh. My burger was quite tasty though. I ordered mine with a fried egg and crispy bacon."}
{"text":"Place isn't bad for the price, especially  being in South Park. Service is friendly, the seats are odd. You stand in line to order and then they bring it to the table, so you tip up front. The food is pretty good. I would return."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great decor.

This place does being a burger joins about as well as any restaurant can do its genre of choice.  We were in Charlotte for the summer for work and with 2 kids this place became our little family oasis.  A few highlights:

1.  Staff is great.  They've got a lot of specialty burgers and were happy to give thoughts on their favorites.  We went over the 4th and they were quick to give my kids free American flags and balloons.  Kids meals and kids menus are provided.

2.  Food is great.  Burgers and Fries are delicious, their tater tots are delicious.  Milk shakes and ice cream were a bit hit with the family. 

3.  Ambiance is fun, unique.  Has a \"Route 66 feel\".  There are TV's for sports but it is not obnoxious.

Food is a little heavy, but if you are expecting burgers, fries and a milk shake to leave you feeling ready for a jog you may have unreasonable expectations.  Food is a little more expensive than the average burger place but worth it in my opinion.  We'll definitely be back when we are in CLT again!"}
{"text":"I went this review unfairly under the morehead location. I was corrected. I checked door dash and it came from this location. So here we go. Oh my god. This was so awful. Seriously- I was tired and I just wanted a good burger. I've never given anywhere one star. And the only reason it gets 1 star is because eating their food is better than starving to death or dying - I guess.  I could barely finish it. Get if you are dieting and you don't want to overeat it's great.  It made McDonald's look like a 5 star dining restaurant. The fries were stiff and just nasty. Like heating up day old fast food fries I am having flashbacks to how absolutely horrible this food was. Oh god!! Ewww. Just stay away. I heard Morehead is better"}
{"text":"I built a custom spicy burger and it did not disappoint. We ordered a nice array of sides (tots, sweet potato fries, and onion rings) and all of them were excellent. We also got pints of great beer to wash it down. We sat outside under the roof where they had 3 or 4 TVs all tuned to different sports channels. Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"Very cheery place with plenty of seating and lots of windows. The staff were mighty friendly and were good about making sure tables were wiped down and that the floor was swept.  Prices are pretty reasonable for what you get. I got a grilled cheese with onion rings (almost chose the tater tots because it's not often you see that offered) on the side for around $6.  It is a little bit of a rip off that you have to pay extra for a side, but at least it's fairly priced. The grilled cheese had a generous amount of cheddar cheese (you can pick from a variety of other cheeses, but it will cost you extra) on it and the bread was thick and evenly grilled. The onion rings were very good and come with a spicy dipping sauce. I have to agree with the reviewer below who said the breading was pretty thick.  I liked that though because the breading was very tasty as were the onions inside. My girlfriend got the vegetarian black bean burger which was topped with lettuce and tomato. Definitely not a homemade black bean burger (think Morning Star Farms), but still pretty good. Would have been nice to have a scratch made burger. She got fries and they were hot, well seasoned, and crispy. 

I will definitely be stopping by again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a chicken sandwich with fries and coleslaw.  The chicken had no flavor, bun was soggy and lots of fat in our chicken.  We did not like the coleslaw.  Fries were good.  Our hotdog was mediocre at best.  Food is below average for price you pay.  2 chicken sandwiches your way single, 1 fries, 1 coleslaw and a chili cheese hotdog was $19.43.  I am never impressed with the folks taking my order either.  We are done.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"Friendly service!  I had a chicken club sandwich on wheat bun.  Seriously lacking in flavor.  Definitely needs some seasoning on the chicken.  Bacon was not great either.  The fried pickles, spears, we're pretty good, but that's easy.  Pull out of bag, drop in deep fryer, done.  Nothing to brag about.  Both kids had kids meal burgers and seemed to like them.  Prices were reasonable.  Atmosphere was casual.  I'd try it again, but next time I'll get a burger."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out for a while, and I finally made it in for lunch this week. I was surprised by having to order at the counter, take a table number, and wait for my food to be brought out. The process is fine, I was just expecting table service. And if I were in there in the evening or on the weekend for a couple of drinks, I assume I'd have to go back to the counter and order again for another drink...?

Anyhow... my honest assessment of ARB was it was underwhelming. 

The girl behind the counter was neither friendly nor helpful. When I told her I hadn't been there before and asked for her advice between the turkey or black bean burger, her response was (and I kid you not): \"well, people order both.\" Uh... ok... thanks?

My lunch companion said something about his \"half & half\" side item. I didn't immediately see that listed on the menu, so I asked Miss Helpful what that was and she gestured towards the menu and said \"our sides are listed there.\" It would have been nice to know I could have ordered half fries & half onion rings, like my friend. Could I have ordered half & half of something else? I have no idea, as she never answered my question.

The highlight of the meal was the sweet potato fries. I usually don't care for that type (when I splurge on fries, I want regular, ol' fries), but these were surprisingly yummy. I tried my friend's regular fries and I would not order those again.

My black bean burger wasn't impressive. It reminded me of one of the frozen brands I get at the grocery store. Several reviews have talked up all the free toppings but cheese & guac were extra. Basics like sauces, a sad piece of pale iceberg lettuce, onions, and tomato were included.

If someone wanted to meet me here or there was a group gathering (on the large patio when they have live music, perhaps), I would go. The experience wasn't bad enough to keep me away (I'd definitely order a regular or turkey burger next time), but I wouldn't go out of my way to return here. Several other burger joints come to mind as far better options."}
{"text":"Hey wow, another burger joint in Charlotte!  

This one seems like a cross between a Five Guys and a Johnny Rockets with one exception, they serve beer and wine here.

The menu is quite extensive with burger options, sandwiches, salads, kids meals, appetizers and shakes.   And the prices are great.  $6.95 for a signature burger.  That's almost as cheap as a fast food joint.

Anyway, I ordered the roadside rally, fries and a beer.   The burger was decent with good flavor and it was a southern classic with slaw and chili.  The fries were ok.  They are the kind that are flash fried and then fried again.  Nothing unique about them and the beer, well I wasn't impressed with the selection.  They have craft beers but since this is a locally based chain, you'd think they would have local beers...but no, they do not.  

Overall, decent place with decent prices.  $15 for burger, fries and beer isn't too bad."}
{"text":"After giving this place several tries, and for it being walking distance to my house, I REALLY wish this place was a tad better. I mean I would love to have a close by burger place I can count on. 
This, is not a place you can count on, let me explain:

Pace: I was there today doing a takeout, and I waited a good 15 minute, seriously why do they have parking spaces that are only for 15 minute if it takes at least 15 minute for your order to roll out? Oh and let me say, I only ordered a side order of fries, and it took that long.

Everytime I am here, I always see something that should not happen. Either a customer yelling at the lady taking order, a driver pulling out of the parking lot giving someone a finger or apathetic staff...

Food: 2/5 stars...This may literally be generous, I try not to give places 1 star unless if the food is absolute crap I have to go vomit type food. I watched them cook my fries, it was literally nothing more than a frozen bag of pre-made fries that they dump into the fryer. That is great and all, but why do you charge $3 for a side of fries that is nothing special? May I mention, the portion of the size, don't try to order 1 side for 2 people to share, you won't even have enough for 1 person.

Perks: Pretty decent deco(they recently put in a motorcycle inside the restaurant), outdoor seating, flat screen TVs even on outside patio and free wifi. It's kinda cute they they have 2 special parking spots for bikes...American Roadside, get it?"}
{"text":"I like this a very reasonably priced burger bar.  The cheeseburger which is a build your own is about $5 & is normal sized.  You can add yummy things like grilled onions.

Their regular fries & sweet potato fries are really good

I like sitting at the bar because it's full-service instead of having to order at the counter & they've got great tv placement inside & outside!

One night we were in & they were playing great blues music!  I love that it wasn't all 80's all the time, like too many restaurants do now.

Servers have always been nice when we've been in.

They have free wi-fi, too!"}
{"text":"Nice burger joint in SouthPark. Menu with several twists on American classic burgers and happy to see a turkey burger for us non-beefers. Went during the business-week at lunchtime and the line moved very smoothly. Fries were spot on, crispy and cooked all the way through. If you're a fries person, you may want to get a double order. Tried the chocolate fountain drink which was...interesting."}
{"text":"Hmm... you might almost think that with this place popping up, there is a new focus on non-fast food burgers or something. Unfortunately this one doesn't quite hit the same notes as, say Five Guys or Smashburger, even though it's definitely playing in the same sandbox.

The theme is about right, but they are really missing something and it just doesn't feel quite on. Perhaps it isn't so much that the place is missing something, but instead that they are missing customers. Figuring it may be me, we ordered some of the items from their menu, and were promptly not impressed with much of the menu.

It isn't that it's bad - it's just that it's also not all that good either. The location is a good one, the appearance great, the staff is friendly and even the menu sounds interesting, but unfortunately what is delivered on the plate just isn't worth another trip back."}
{"text":"With so many businesses in Southpark, you'd think there would be more places to eat for a quick bite.  Unfortunately, its either white table cloth restaurants, fast food and a few disappointing sandwich places.  Thankfully, American Roadside opened and it has help to add a little diversity to the lunchtime landscape.  

It's a burger place where everything is made to order.  I've had lunch there a dozen times or so since its opened and the food was the best the first week.  Then it got worse and now its heading back to great.  I'm not sure what was going on there but even at its worst, it was still lightyears ahead of the other burger place with the Taco name.  

Choose the onion rings over the fries"}
{"text":"It went very well on my first visit - for a reason. There weren't many people eating - as we came in at right time, so maybe - they had time on their plate and cooked us a a good meal?   Anyway, fries are good... very crispy. Ordered chicken burger - grilled very well, no soggy veggies. Yet, messy and yummy. I'll try again to see if they held up their end. :)"}
{"text":"5 star service 2 star food!
Went here because I drive by it at work and found a living social coupon for it. We started with the fried pickles, they were either 3.99 or 4.99 I don't recall but they were spears which im not fond of(my fault for not asking) but worst of all you got 5 of them and ranch, they were mediocre at best and way overpriced for five average sized pickle spears.  

The burgers were average, about what you would find at a chiles(actually last burger I had at chiles was better) or Applebee's or a place that doesn't specialize in burgers and just has them on menu, definitely not what I was expecting for a place named American burger co., if you have burger in your name you should do a better job than this.  1/3 pound burgers size was fine, taste was ok, they don't give you any cooking options or at least didn't ask us if they do provide that.  Almost tasted premade and not fresh pattied not sure, it was better than true fast food but not as good as say five guys or similar fast casual type places.  I had the hot mess, pepper jack, bacon, jalepeno, fries, and a chipotle ranch sauce, overall flavor was good but as I said before nothing about it was great, my girlfriend had the mushroom and Swiss and she said is was fine but nothing special. We shared some tater tots typical massed produced goodness can't mess those up.  We tried the donut holes for dessert and they were hot and fresh, reminded me of a Chinese donut in texture and taste.

Service was excellent, everybody was nice and friendly and everything came out fast, food was adequate but left a lot to be desired, if I name my restaurant American burger co. I would make sure the product was a little better quality.  I wouldn't go back personally there are better burgers lots of places around town, if you find a groupon or something give it a try otherwise might want to pick a different burger place."}
{"text":"Very good. I like the quick service casual feel. Price was right. Burger was tasty, juicy & just pink enough in the center, stacked well so you get a taste of the fixings in every bite. You must get the tater tots! Perfectly crispy. And the fudgesicle milkshake was to die for. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's alright. The sweet potato fries are not as thin as some places so that was good. Burger was like a frozen patty...tasted fine though. Wouldn't be my first choice for a burger but would still come back for location convenience."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of five guys but with more options. The food is good, enjoyed the burger, mac n cheese was ok, something kids would definately love. they have a really nice patio and service was quick."}
{"text":"The burger was good, but on the smaller side. The tots were great. Chocolate shake was great!
Ordered on a Friday at lunch and got my food quick.
Will be back!"}
{"text":"Just another Millennial Burger joint. Better than Burger Fi but not as good as Shake Shack.

Staff was friendly. It's good for a change of pace."}
{"text":"Its a OK burger joint, with a good beer tap selection.

I ended up getting the roadside burger (Quad-cheese burger) by accident.  It was a pleasant but serious mistake to handle.  The burger was tasty and large.  If you are hungry and can handle the amount of cheese and meat, i would recommend trying it.  It looks horribly bad for you and it probably is, but it is nom-ilicous.

Clean and bright.  Looks like a nice patio."}
{"text":"The burgers are really good. I got the rise-n-shine burger. My friend got the mushroom one. Both were delicious. The onion rings are amazing!! Whatever sauce came with the rise-n-shine....man!!! It was so delicious! I kept dipping my tots in it. Tried a Carolina dog for the first time. I see what the hype is about. It's pretty good."}
{"text":"Burgers are the focus here, but there are some other sandwiches and salads available for the non-carnivores. When I popped in at lunch time, there were only a couple of tables occupied and no one waiting at the register. I was able to mumble through a burger order (with pimento cheese, yes please!) and a side of onion rings.

From my seat, I browsed the internet on their free wifi and noticed one burger sitting in the kitchen window. Four minutes, six minutes, eight minutes. I knew it was mine (no one had ordered after me) but at this point I simply wanted to know how long it would take for the counter guy (manager? not sure.) to quit his conversation with another patron and bring over my burger. In the end, it was the kitchen guy who did so, warning me that the plate was hot. Of course it was hot, it had been sitting under the warmer for more than nine minutes. The burger was still hot though the cheese had melted quite a bit.

Onion rings were good. Crispy outside but not too mushy inside. Dipped in the tangy sauce provided.

Fountain has Coke products as well as a \"Chocolate Bosco soda\". I had a sip and it was okay and while not my thing, others will certainly enjoy it.

Outside patio tables for nicer days, though the traffic on Fairview is intense.

Would I come here again? Yes, probably. When it's a little better staffed than just two."}
{"text":"The staff is top notch and the burgers are wonderful!!!
I had my son's birthday party here and the staff was GREAT!!!! These guys went above and beyond to make sure every one was happy."}
{"text":"Good burger joint! Had the double cheeseburger with my pick of fixings. For my side I got the sweet potato fries. 
The fries we not that great. I think they were too sweet and a little on the mushy side. So that was dissapointing. Other than that the burger was pretty good. 

A friend got onion rings, and after seeing them I wished I had gotten them too! The lugnuts (little doughnut holes) were good as well. We shared a plate.

I would go back again but be careful about choosing my sides."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I had the Mac Attack burger. Mac n cheese, bacon, ketchup, onions, and super delicious. Best burger I've had in a long time. My wife got the veggie burger and it was equally awesome."}
{"text":"Ordinary burger, nothing special at all.  You would think a burger place would be really really good with their burgers, however this place is just average.  The buns are blah and the stuff inside is average at best when you are talking about burgers. 

Customer service was great though.  Great group of people.  Prices were rather cheap so that's a plus.  Mac n cheese and sweet potatoe fries were good, but nothing great.  

There are better options in Charlotte for food and for burgers so I would just go there if I were you."}
