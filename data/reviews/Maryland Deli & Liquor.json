{"text":"Breakfast sandwiches and burritos are very good.  I had the Buffalo Chicken sandwich for lunch and it was tasty too.  Customer service is bad to good but never great.  They make the food when you order it, so you will have to wait a bit longer than in a fast food restaurant but its worth it if you value freshly cooked food.  This store has a huge selection of liquors and wines and one shot mini bottles too."}
{"text":"The best gas station/ deli / liquor store/ everything ..... Stopped in and found Johnny Walker blue..... Johnny Walker blue at a gas station  wow wow wow thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a place like this close to my house! Twice now, I have stopped in here before a hair appointment to grab some quick grub. Both times were extremely satisfying. I will definitely be coming back in the future to try more from their menu. Side note: The biscuit that comes with the chicken special is amazing- buttery, flakey, moist, warm and topped with honey. Mmmm heaven."}
{"text":"It is the best Deli/Liquor/Gas Station around, and with the addition of Krispy Krunchy cajun style chicken, it is worthy of 4 stars.  I'll put their sandwiches up against any fast-food franchise (OK, not setting the bar too high there).  Seriously, great cold-cuts (Boar's Head brand), great bread, great fried chicken.  Good enough coffee, and better than most breakfast sandwiches.

Pretty good selection of canned or bottled craft beers, as well.

Prices are reasonable, though I think their beer prices are a bit on the high side.  $1 more then I consider right for a six-pack of craft beer.  Can't beat the location (for me) though."}
{"text":"Love this place. Tons of options, great selection, fast and polite service. The quality of deli items is top notch (all Boar's Head). Some of the best sandwiches around. Pass on the fried chicken."}
{"text":"So, the way I figure it, a 24/7 gas station/deli should be open, hmmmmmm, let me think, 24/7?  I'll give you Christmas; they could reasonably closed on Christmas.  Not New Years, people are hung over or just getting out of jail/back from Vegas, so, open New Years.   But yesterday?  


                              April 21, 2013, CLOSED!  9:54pm, CLOSED.  NOT OPEN

Oh well.

NOTE TO OWNER OF MARYLAND DELI AND LIQUOR, AKA: 7TH STREET SHELL STATION: BAD BUSINESS, PAL.  BAD BUSINESS.  I'LL NEVER COME BACK TO OVERSPEND ON EVERYTHING, (which if they are open, it's a convenience I'll pay for) TO NOW FIND YOU CLOSED!~  The only reason I've paid your prices in the past is because you were a good last resort.  Now you're just \"last\".

Note to self: never go here again.  Tell 100 friends to never go here again, how they just \"take off\" on a Sunday night.  That's called word-of-mouth, pal, and you or your \"gone fishin' \" staff just earned some muy, muy mal word-of-mouth."}
{"text":"I know it seems weird but The Corner Deli inside this gas station is amazing!!!!!!! Their breakfast burrito's perfection. I originally ordered subs and burrito's from grubhub and did not have the slightest clue they were from a gas station. They use Boar's Head meat and cheese so it is top notch. I highly suggest unless you really need delivery going in to shop it's almost half price from grubhub. Soooooooooooooooooo Good you gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Friendly employees, great sandwiches, open 24-7! Prices are good for what you get. Sandwiches are freshly made and huge!"}
{"text":"smack dab on the NE corner of Maryland and 7th Street, this is the grocery store under the Shell sign.

yummy sandwiches. nothing you can't live without. but i think they are the best sandwiches you will get from a gas station. place also stocks a thousand different types of 50ml shooters. larger bottles too. but i'm not talkin bout that right now.


so lets see, fill your car with gas, fill your belly with a sandwich and wash it down with 3 shots of Jim Beam. you rock. don't get caught with a DUI now."}
