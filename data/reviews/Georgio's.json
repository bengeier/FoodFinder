{"text":"I've been here twice.  Decided to give them another try after a bad first experience.  The second time wasn't any better.  The food here is a low grade cafe food.  The pork chops were dry and tasteless.  The mash potatoes were rock hard.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the country steak with gravy, corn, and cream potatoes.  My meat was slightly warm which was problematic for me because I prefer my food hot.  I ate quickly since it was not hot; however, my cream potatoes and corn were steaming. The corn and potatoes tasted like they were both from the same can, and the cornbread muffins were hard and cold too.    Now, my mother ordered a chicken cheese steak, french fires, and fried okra.  Her food was soooo good.  The chicken was season to perfection with the onions, peppers, and cheese.  Her fries were hot (you can't mess up fries), and the okra was breaded with the necessary amount of bread, the okra was fresh and the lemonade was the best Country Time I have had in a while.    Georgio's is not all bad, but my guess is you have to be careful what you order."}
{"text":"Good food great price. Dirties place I've ever seen. Floors look like they haven't been cleaned all day. Everything was sticky, napkin holders, condiments, even the menus were filthy. Hostess was standing around doing nothing with plenty of time to clean menus. It's like they don't care about cleanliness. I wonder how clean the kitchen is."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast. Iam 46 years old and i felt very young in here. The food was nursing home ready. BLAND and slow. But hubby did get 2 large biscuits with his meal."}
{"text":"Second time here. Good both times. Very popular, busy place. Took the grandkids yesterday, Valentine's Day, for pizza. Great pizza, for northern Georgia. The place was packed, but the wait was only about 15 minutes and we got 3 delicious pan pizzas served right away by a very pleasant waitress in a warm and pleasant atmosphere. I wish more restaurants were like this one. Makes me want to go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the breakfast here.  You will be treated well and orders are always served promptly and hot.   I just wish the entire menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner were available online."}
{"text":"Really need an online menu since I would be placing take out orders - never tried it but pictures look like it may be good food. I have no idea what to order so I guess I wont be eating there. Shame"}
{"text":"The food was fine, the portions huge!  So if you are a big eater this is the place for you.  They give you soup with your entree, which is simple but very favorful.  The owner wife is rude and abusive to the staff, shouting at them in the dinning room.  For me this uncalled for and make dinners uncomfortable.  Other wise my meal was good."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Fast and friendly service. Try the livermush, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Giorgio's is a nice place with simple, but good, food; nice portions; efficient service, and fair prices.    People are friendly too!  Giorgio's has been in business for more than a few years, and it's easy to see why."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years.  Longer than I would like to admit.  If you are looking for a good meat and 3 type of place, then this is your spot.  We mostly eat here for lunch and the specials are reasonable.  You shouldn't expect fresh at these prices and the speed (which is pretty fast) at which you receive your order.  You can expect consistency and decent food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Really good comfort food. Large selection, fair cost. Great service. Will return. Will try breakfast next."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great breakfast; the sausage gravy biscuits are phenomenal and totally homemade!"}
{"text":"Awesome home cooking.  Very good food. Fantastic price tons of food.  My first time a Thursday night just happened to see the place and stopped for something to go.   Shocked at great price great smell of food. They were packed and running out of food and more people were coming in.  A warm atmosphere.  The owner knew a lot of the customers so good clientele.  Had the chicken very moist   large menu but specials of the day is the best value.  Great new little spot for me.  Fast service"}
{"text":"At later dinner on a Friday night... the place was very dirty (floors), but I figured they must have had a heck of an earlier service, so I was encouraged that they have a good following.  I ordered fried flounder and french fries, with a side of slaw.  The fish was fishy and the batter was so hard, I could't cut it with my fork!!!  The fries were fishy, too! EW!  Hubby got chicken and dumplings.  It was salty and slimy with very little chicken (both in quantity and size of chunks, they weren't chunks, really).  Son got a giant burger, and it satisfied him.  I tried a bite, it seemed like a GFS frozen patty, to accompany his GFS french fries.  Overall impression, this is a re-heat and serve place, which is how they can offer the cheap pricing that they do... not that they buy wholesome fresh base items, that aren't expensive to begin with, and cook those.  If this is fresh cooking, then this is an alternate universe, where everything is backwards."}
{"text":"Busy on a Saturday morning but we sat down right away. Waited over 40 minutes for scrambled eggs and an egg sandwich. We weren't given an explanation and the waitress never checked in. Just a sorry for the wait when it finally did arrive. Food was just ok. Definitely wasn't worth this kind of wait."}
{"text":"First time visit for breakfast. It was good. Nothing really special. They do have a pretty good biscuit"}
{"text":"I was playing music in town last weekend and decided to have a bite before setting up. I had noticed their sign on the way in to town and thought I'd check things out.  Georgio's is in a strip center with a Food Lion (nasty company in Charlotte - never go there), a chinese place, and a pizza place. The pizza was out of the picture; just didn't feel like being disappointed with a mediocre pie today. I like to do Chinese since I can usually get something that might be healthy but I looked in the door and saw styrofoam plates which totally blew it for that place. That left Georgio's. I loved that this was obviously the place the locals ate. This is always a good sign that people don't get sick from eating here. In a small town this is an important place to know about.  I ordered the Hamburger which was made to order, juicey, and made with high quality meat without fillers. The tomatoes were also tasty and probably local.  This was probably the best burger I have had in a good while! The help was very friendly and everyone seemed to truly enjoy their food.  I was a happy man and will be back. Oh yes! The prices are too low for the quality of the cookin'. I would have easily paid 20% more. Georgio's is located just off route 74 on the way into Cramerton."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed. There was more Italian food than Greek food. I ordered the Greek gyro, and the tzatsiki was great, the meat was absolutely gross. Drenched in grease and salt-- it resembled more of sausage than kebab meat.   They didn't even have spanakopita, which is as traditional as you can get! The feta cheese on the Greek salad was from Walmart-- the crumbled type. I don't recommend this place if you're looking for Greek food. Not at all."}
{"text":"It's always awesome. Today I had the ham & cheese omelet with house special potatoes. Lesley asked me how come their toast tasted so much better than at home. Another awesome job guys!"}
{"text":"Order the grits! They are really creamy. Didn't like the eggs thou."}
{"text":"Great service good prices and lunch was very good, super nice portions and home town atmosphere. I had the baked chicken and was very pleased."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Georgio's for over 15 years. I'm impressed with the consistency of the food and the service. Servings are nice and big. You'll be hard pressed to finish a pasta dish by yourself. The home-cooking daily specials are wonderful. Just what the doctor ordered after a few days of eating fast food. This place is popular with regulars so can fill up fast at rush hours. Servers are friendly and rarely rattled by a large crowd. Always a pleasure coming here!"}
{"text":"Have never had a meal here except breakfast, untill now. Stopped in for dinner the other night before going to see the lights in McAdenville. I got a HUGE chicken breast marinated and cooked in Greek spices. It was moist and tender and delicious! Got  2 sides with it which one of them was that classic southern dessert, banana pudding. The Vanilla wafers were still crunchy and not soggy. The wife got the beef sirlion tips over rice which she said were very tender. The rolls and corn bread muffins were also very good. The dinner menu is extensive covering Greek and Italian food to subs and burgers and the like. Daily specials too. For a couple depending on what you order, $25-30 should cover it with drinks tax and tip. Great for breakfast (pls see first review) and now a good place for dinner as well."}
{"text":"The food is always DELICIOUS!! I love the turkey/chicken and dressing the best. (Gotta have my cranberry sauce,too)The barbecue chicken comes in second. It has a great flavor and is always tender. All the home cooked veggies are soo good that it's hard to choose which ones you want. GREAT PLACE TO EAT........"}
{"text":"Busy on a weekday (holiday week) morning and only two waitresses working plus a woman who might have been the manager/owner. I'd expect the food to take a bit when it's like this and it did. Service was slow as well, because these gals were trying hard but not able to keep up with the turnover in tables. As well, the kitchen had issues coordinating breakfasts with toast. In some operations, this is the waitstaff who do toasting so maybe they dropped it. When you're halfway through your omelet before the toast arrives, and you've just seen the table next to you have the same problem, that's an issue.  The omelet was great, the home fries were a little too buttered for me, and the toast (once it arrived) was good.  Can't beat the price.  (And to the mom across from me who insisted on clinking her spoon when stirring her coffee? Learn some damned manners.)"}
{"text":"Pretty good I'd have to say. The Mac n Cheese is crazy good, the biscuits are decent, and the hamburger steak that I got on my second visit was to die for. My first visit was nice, and the food was good but the pork chops were boneless, and was ran through a tenderizer. It had the veil cutlets treatment. It was decent, but nothing like bone-in. The lunch special is at a great price too. Will go back."}
{"text":"This is a great family owned Greek restaurant.  They have been serving great good with excellent service for many years.  I've not been here for years but met up with some family and friends and six of us had lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  They have a great menu with plenty of Greek & Italian selections.  They also have specials every day of the week.  The grilled pork chops and grilled chicken tenders are great specials and you get two sides, plus bread and soup!  Meredith will provide you excellent service with a smile!"}
