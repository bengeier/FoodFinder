{"text":"We stop here for dinner on a Sunday afternoon they have a full menu of options displayed and the lady tells me they only have tacos burritos and quesadillas seriously what kind of restaurant is this, I just walked away"}
{"text":"Great little spot for tacos and burritos. Love the breakfast tortas and the tamales. Be careful with the salsas they are spicy and good."}
{"text":"Great food. Prices are cheap. Friendly staff. I ordered the super papas and my husband got the ham n egg breakfast burrito. The fries where great crispy and the meat very juicy with melted cheese sour cream tomatoes. Burrito had a lot of ham. We also split a carne asada burrito very good and it had rice and beans. Totally recommend everyone looking for good Mexican food to check it out. It's hidden but glad we stopped by to check it out."}
