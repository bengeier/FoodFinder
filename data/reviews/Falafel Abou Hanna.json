{"text":"Needed to grab a quick lunch today and was craving good falafel. This place is so good! Real mom and pop place, tiny inside but a small terasse outside so a good option when it's nice out. Falafels are crisp and tasty with delicious toppings: fresh mint, parsley, pickled turnip, lots of ripe tomatoes and tahini sauce with an option to make it spicy by adding a bit of sriracha. And at $2.99, what a bargain! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fresh, flavorful falafel. If you're in the mood for trying something new, the Fatteh is possibly the best, most interestibg and most flavorful dish I've ever had anywhere. This family owned small restaurant is friendly and clean, and just... so yummy!!"}
{"text":"I had one bite and fell instantly  in love with Abou Hanna's falafel...I was pleasantly surprised with this family owned small restaurant...and I'm so happy I decided to give it a try...I cannot describe how delicious these falafel are...super crunchy on the outside, fresh and tender on the inside..the friendly owner told me that they were not powder based falafel but made the proper way from scratch..and I could definitely tell he was telling the truth...two thumbs up to abou Hanna falafel...I'll definitely be back again and again.."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a while and I finally had a chance today.  Very small and intimate setting (nothing fancy), but the food is made with lots of love and care.  Everything is made from scratch by the husband/wife couple who own this joint.  They are very hospitable (as many Lebanese are) and the Falafels were some of the best I've ever tried.  They also make yummy \"foul\" and \"balila\" (bean and chickpea dishes)... VERY nutritious!  The price point is also just right."}
{"text":"Don't drive past this place and just give it a glance.  When you see the Falafel sign, stop!  Absolutely and without question the best falafel I've had in a very long (25+ years) time.  Truly mean that and the fact that the owners are as grounded and genuinely nice as every other review suggests just makes it all the better a stop.  Sample other things on the menu, in particular give the Fatteh a try.  Don't pass on this one!"}
{"text":"After visiting this little humble hole in the wall place over five times and consuming most of their Lebanese vegetarian dishes and also their falafel sandwich, I can easily give them 5 stars. No frills or schmills, well spiced and hit the right notes.   I'd be back for sure if I happened to be in the West Island. They lose one star which has nothing to do with food taste, quality or service. It's for not taking any payment other than cash. Besides that, all good. It's a must try place if you like this particular cuisine."}
{"text":"First time visit to this establishment. I found the place clean - the reception friendly and the food ten plus - I really enjoyed my first falafel and ordered another to go - excellent place for vegetarians - everything is made fresh - all in all a very great place to eat."}
{"text":"Veryyyyy tasty falafels! Crunchy on the outside, tender inside! I always ask for hot peppers on the side! Very good and cheap option for when you're in that neighborhood."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh falafel. We were on vacation looking for a place to eat on route to Toronto.  Price is super accessible and we had to order another falafel once we had the first two since it was so delicious! The owner shared his story with us, letting us know how he really wants to bring the authentic flavours of his home country through the falafels. Really great service and we'd have to say the best falafel we had so far!"}
{"text":"Amazing falafel. Very fresh, made on the spot. Flavourful, and cheap... Great little spot no one knows about... Don't go to Adonis for a sandwich - go across the street and eat here"}
{"text":"Falafel - Abou Hanna Cuisine Libanaise  Small place but amazing Falafel! Right opposite Adonis"}
{"text":"Tasty, inexpensive, and friendly service.  What more can someone want?  Everything is freshly made when you order it."}
{"text":"Before I went to this restaurant, I hated falafels because they were so dry and bland, but after strong convincing from my friend to try this place out, I fell in love with their falafels. The falafels that they make here are nothing like the ones they make at amir or basha.  Their falafels are made fresh and we can see them make it from scratch and it made a huge difference in taste. Furthermore, the price for a falafel sandwich is so much cheaper than at amir or Adonis!  Other than the amazing falafels, the owner is extremely kind. I would definitely suggest this place for people that think that they dislike falafels!"}
{"text":"The best and freshest falafels you will ever eat! Certainly not a fancy restaurant but the quality is outstanding! If falafel is what you're looking for then look no further!"}
{"text":"Stop looking for the best Falafels in town. THIS IS IT!! The Falafels are some of the best I have ever had. They are crispy goodness without the greasy taste. The owner/cook is super friendly, the food is amazing. Always fresh and authentic. Don't expect a huge variety in the menu. But what they have available is all delicious. Very good quality/price value. I'm a regular and got many of my friends hooked. I usually go for a couple of sandwiches to eat there and grab a dozen or two to take home."}
{"text":"The absolute best Falafel and Hummus by far!!!! Fresh made daily, addicted to their hummus!"}
{"text":"Ever since eating falafel at restaurant Daou a few weeks ago, I've been getting falafel cravings so I booked myself no less than 5 falafel places to visit in the weeks/months to come and this is one of them.  Visually it's a small and modest looking place with a small exterior patio to eat on while looking at a busy boulevard. What did we eat? Well, went with what the place was all about... FALAFEL!  We ordered a pair each and they were made fresh for us by the kind hospitable staff who invited us to eat outside as the weather was really nice. They were really well done with the right amount of seasonings. The pitas didn't survive long...  With some juices we ate 4 falafel pitas for about $16.  Ridiculous.  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow great falafel & foul here! Fresh and tasty! Super small joint. Friendly owner. Will be coming back for sure!"}
