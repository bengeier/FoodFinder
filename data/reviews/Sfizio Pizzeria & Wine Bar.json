{"text":"Very friendly staff. Pizza was good. Chocolate dessert was amazing. Only problem was that pasta , garlic breads etc. wasn't available due to the oven not working."}
{"text":"Since Sfizio is a new Italian restaurant that opened in my neighbourhood I was excited to try it out - I could use a good Italian eatery close to home! So one Sunday afternoon, I ventured into Sfizio Pizzeria & Wine Bar for a quick lunch. The owner cautioned that they weren't officially opened yet, only accepting customers as part of a soft-opening. Although a large part of their menu wasn't offered (mainly alcohol and their Neapolitian style pizzas), the warm and welcoming owner was convincing enough for me to stay.  The food was mediocre at best. The pastas that we ordered (Spaghetti Bolognese and Alfredo Penne) were served rather cold, but I dismissed it as a soft-opening kink. All their table breads and pizza doughs are made in-house, and they have a Neapolitian style wood-burning oven for their pizzas. Will definitely try that next time I stop by.  The Tiramisu was the by far the most memorable part of the meal. It's light and creamy like a parfait, and not too coffee-heavy, just the way I like it.  I think Sfizio has room for improvement, but if they work those kinks out, it seems like it could be a promising little Italian spot."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Fantastic pizza, friendly staff and a warm atmosphere with great service!"}
{"text":"I live close to Sfizio and was waiting with anticipation for it to open. Have been there at least 5 times hoping that it will get better but it never does. Sorry!  The food, is just okay. Nothing great. It is bland, no spices or flavour. I ordered the lasagna last week and it tasted like just boiled noodles. In addition, instead of a nice fat square piece, it came to me as if it slipped off of the serving utensil onto my plate. Poor presentation!  The beer on tap has always been flat and the selection, again, it just okay.   I have ordered off of their lunch menu a few times and again, it is just okay. A bit expensive for what you get; semi flavourless food and small portions.   I do admit that the straight up basil and cheese pizza with tomato sauce is pretty decent. The crust is thin, a bit on the chewy side but not bad.   Near opening day, I ordered a cappuccino and was told that their milk delivery did not come in yet so the cappuccino wasn't going to be as good as it should. Then why serve it to me? I had to throw it out it tasted that bad.  The washroom looks like your uncles basement from the 70s and is in dire need of a massive renovation. It smells musty and is creepy looking.  I do hope that Sfizio gets better. I want to like it as the servers are really nice but the food has got to get better if it is going to stay."}
{"text":"Pretty good Neapolitan pizza but poor service. Waiter didn't bring over menu while he gestured that we seat ourselves. Ordered before the table next to us but he inputted their order first and hence brought their food first. When serving another table, he had asked if the people there wanted parmesan or chili. For our table, I had to request those as he was about to leave our table after delivering food. For a lunch costing $40 for two pizzas, unfortunately, food quality and service didn't match up."}
{"text":"I'm from California USA and I was visiting Toronto Canada, I was looking for a good place to have dinner and sure enough I found this one and it did not disappoint me. I got great customer service, the owner was great and polite. It was a very welcoming environment and I'll definitely recommend this to anybody that's looking for a good dinner with great customer service. I had a mushroom pizza with ham this is the best pizza by far in Toronto. I recommend this !!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a date night. We live in the area and had always walked by/been interested to try. So happy we finally did. The host and owner are warm and welcoming. The pizza's were incredible! Possibly the best in the city."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here recently for our anniversary. The staff is lovely and the restaurant is so cozy. We went on a Friday night and were invited by our waitress, the hostess, and I believe the owner to stay longer for a night of music and makeovers. Unfortunately my husband and I had both worked a long day so we didn't get to stay for that, but we were able to enjoy the service and the dinner atmosphere nonetheless.  Our waitress was incredibly friendly and attentive. The food was tasty and authentic. We enjoyed everything we were served (antipasto, pizza, tiramisu) and intend to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"I like to consider myself a pizza enthusiast. I am always looking for the best pizza wherever I go, and try to lean on trip advisor or yelp when locating the best. I've now spent a couple evenings over the last couple weeks in a place which I would consider to have the BEST pizza I have ever had outside of Italy. Sfizio is, unequivocally, my favorite pizza in Toronto. I've tried the rest of the so called \"best pizza\" restaurants in town, and I stand by my statement. I have had both the traditional Margherita pizza as well as my favorite, the Diavola (without olives, I'm not a monster). One word....perfection. Do yourself a favor and try this place out. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is perfect for either a date night or just a casual night out for a bite to eat. The rest of the menu looks authentic and delicious and there is a pretty nice wine list to pair with your meals. I will be sure to try many of the other dinner options in the coming weeks. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I had the pizze diavola which was excellent. Friendly staff made sure I had everything I needed. Service with a smile and a thank you. Thanks for making an out of towner from the states feel welcome."}
{"text":"Located along the non touristy and \"down to earth\" part of Bloor Street (East), Sfizio is family owned, family run, and family happy.    Originally from Abruzzi, what travel gurus call the new Tuscany, the proprietors brought in a brick pizza oven that is the very foundation of Sfizio's Pizzeria.  However, Sfizio is more of an osteria than a pizzeria and Italian appetizers, pastas, and good wines are on offer.    The pizza is prepared in the Italian manner, with great crusts and sauce, but with a scarcity of mozzarella and other cheeses.  Alas, I am not cosmopolitan enough to appreciate this pizza, and on return would order additional cheese to compliment my Margareta Pizza.    This is a wonderful spot, filled with the sound of happy diners celebrating the essence of food, wine and camaraderie.  My taste in pizza is just \"my taste,\" and other folks would love the ambiance, warmth, and kitchen at Sfizio."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in and you're greeted by the pizza chef and the stone oven, you instantly feel at home! The food is sensational and the staff is all very happy and friendly. I will definitely be back for all you can eat pizza night!"}
{"text":"Went here last night. It definitely deserves a place as one of Toronto's best Napoli style pizza joints. If you like Neapolitan pizza. Try these guys."}
{"text":"Pros: Haven't had service this good in a while, slightly above average pizza at a decent price.  Con: Decor a little tacky, wine a little expensive, aisles a little squished.   Verdict: Would recommend."}
{"text":"Go here regularly both to eat in or takeout. The owners and staff are all extremely welcoming and friendly. Pizzas are made in a real wood burning oven and are definitely the best I've ever had in this city. The pastas and other dishes are all quite good as well and the waiters are extremely knowledgable with their wines. Have never had a less than great experience here and I will keep going back!"}
{"text":"On first walking in, one is surprised that such a restaurant exists at Sherbourne on Bloor. The decor is dated, and tired, but you can tell by the meals on peoples plates that the food is a cut above. Owner run and managed (he makes the Pizza in their wood oven), the service is just ok, but the food is outstanding; making up for everything else. I will be back; often. The tomato sauce is excellent, the pizza is delicious, and the arancini balls were eaten up in seconds. Everyone at our table loved the fresh food.   Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting all the top Neapolitan pizza joints in Toronto and stumbled across this place unintentionally- it deserves to be on the list!! If you like delicious Neapolitan pizza you should give this place a try. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Just OK. The pizza crust was burnt and it was slow getting the food (we found out that he had forgotten to put in the pizza order so all the appies/mains came at the same time in the end). Long story short, they're very particular about being \"authentic\" here and I can tell that if you have poor feedback or criticism, I'm not sure if it will be taken constructively. That said, the food was mostly good - seafood pasta had LOTS of seafood in it, much appreciated. Place was clean and intimate, though a bit slow - not much of a place to be on a Friday, but good if you're looking for a quiet spot."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner at Sfizio Pizzeria & Wine Bar.  The service wasn't remarkable, I think our server was VERY new and nervous, she didn't say she was new but it seemed like it.  I ordered the penne alla vodka with pancetta and it was extremely tasty but a bit pricy for what it was (about $17, you can add chicken or shrimp for $3).  The pizza is made in a wood fired oven and was super tasty.  We ordered the nutella pizza for dessert, I would recommend you skip out on that. It was so plain, it just tasted like nutella on toast and it wasn't very nutella-y. A recommendation to them would be to put marshmallows or caramel sauce or something on it.  Our friends ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and calamari. The calamari was pretty decent, the marinara sauce it came with was a little acidic for the calamari but it was great for dipping our crust in!  I would probably come back here. I did enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately in a poor location, don't let it deter you from trying it out! Great pizza, great value. On par with Libretto."}
{"text":"I went to Sfizio last night and have to say that I'm thoroughly impressed with this place!  The wood fire oven pizza is incredible!  I would put it up there with Terroni or Libretto - possibly better than both of these restaurants.  Absolutely delicious and amazing.  The other entrees were tasty as well, but I was surprised by how small the portions were.  The salads were quite good too.  Areas of improvement in my opinion would be the decor and the variety on the menu.  Service was excellent.  The pizza is definitely the gem of this place.  Give it a try, am sure that you will be not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My party made a reservation through Yelp for this restaurant today. When we arrived to the restaurant, we were told that the restaurant was full and that there would not be a table for us despite showing the server confirmation of our Yelp reservation. With no apologies, he claimed that this restaurant is not associated with Yelp's reservation platform and told us to leave. No effort to accommodate us (we were just a party of 4) or to find out what the issue was. The server was extremely rude and unprofessional, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Something within me sits up and pays attention when I spot a wood burning oven the moment I walk through the door. They have a lunch deal that gives you a smaller portion of pizza, a salad and burschetta as a combo.... which gives a more balanced meal. But there is no need for balance when there is pizza, so I naturally ignore the rest of the menu and go straight for a whole pizza. Great variety to choose from so you are bound to find something you like. The dough is well made so it translate to a great crust.   The service was great and they are obviously use to handling large groups. They were quick and efficient but friendly at the same time.  There seems to be alot of repeat customers because they seemed to know the name of many of the patrons that walked in. Definitely a great place for lunch or even when you want to linger longer over your meal."}
{"text":"Best resturaunt I have been to in toronto. The service was great, and they kept bringing food and drinks. All the food, every dish on the table had by all was superb .  We had a large party so that is saying a lot. Ask them to take care of you and they will."}
{"text":"The food was very good, generously portioned, and reasonably priced. The atmosphere was nice, casual, friendly. The service, however, was EXTREMELY slow, even though the restaurant was at most 75% full. We waited for approximately 40 minutes for our appetizer, and 20 minutes for our pizzas (after we finished the appetizer). The proprietor was apologetic, and insisted on a complimentary dessert, even though we were stuffed. It took over 2 hours to have a 3-course meal - good thing we weren't in a rush!"}
{"text":"omg so good.   Probably the best Italian meal I've had in my life....  and I've been to 5 Italian cities. Went simple and tried a penne pasta with sausages in red sauce.  - pasta was perfect and al dente throughout - sauce was perfect amount, not too much, not too little, was not overpowering or unnoticed - sausage had a subtle, sultry smoked taste to it that added to the flavour  My dinnermates around me also had a great experience and ordered everything from seafood wine sauce pasta to thin crust pizza, no complaints. House wine was apparently also good, but I did not try.  I will be coming back and I hope it will live up to this excellent first experience."}
{"text":"The ratings is only for the coffee, wine, and pizza.  Coffee is excellent, I come at least once per working day for a fix of espresso.   Good wine selection for a wide price range (of course with great bias towards Italian wines). No sommelier, but the servers are well-versed with their stock, every single recommendation has been on point.  Pizza is exceptional, with great variety. You can also custom it to your taste if needed be, as it will be freshly made right in front of your eyes (they have a stone oven built-in).    Service is attentive and professional, with a touch of Italian energy and warmth. Flavio will treat you not just like a customer, but also like a long time friend (as long as he gets his morning espresso, and some ladyfingers with it). Camilla is an absolute sweetheart, and the chef will occasionally come out to check if you are satisfied with the food, when things are not really busy (which means he doesn't come out that often, actually).  Overall, excellent coffee and pizza, good wines, excellent service, no verdict on the rest. Solid choice if you are in the area for lunch time."}
{"text":"Big fan! Came here with a co-worker for lunch, and they have a neat deal where you get a half pizza, salad (garden or caesar) and a few little pieces of bruschetta.  Service was quick and attentive, and our server made sure to take our order before a big table put theirs in. Loved the pizza, great crust! We both had the spicy salami, prosciutto and mozzarella, and both disappeared quickly. Will definitely stop by again when working downtown!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Italian food and this is really really good. Everything was amazing. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"It was our first time at this new restaurant in our neighborhood. Our experience was a good surprise for us. We asked to adapt our pizza. Instead of using their white sauce, we had their four cheese pizza with tomato sauce. The pizza was really good. We all liked it.  The waiter was very helpful besides at some point we didn't know who was our waiter anymore, since two of them came to ask the same question.  We were a bit surprised that they served bread to a table next to ours, but not for us. It'd make sense to do the same to everyone there.  Overall, it's worth trying their pizza. We haven't tried other dishes, but if they're tasty like their pizza, it won't be a surprise anymore."}
{"text":"Staff was great and the food was delicious.  The Nutella pizza was also really tasty and sinfully rich.    When I first arrived the waitress sang the praises of the restaraunt, mentioning how everyone says it's delicious and that se say it's just like Italy.  I thought to myself \"Okay lady, slow down, it sounds like you're compensating...\" but believe it or not I really don't think she's wrong!  The food was really wonderful (San Marzano tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella...all DOP) and as someone who was been to Rome (albeit the touristy parts), this pizza was better than what I had in Italy."}
{"text":"I have been walking past this cute restaurant for a year as I live in the area.  I think the massive stone round oven (using real fire wood) grabbed my attention. We asked the helpful waitress what she recommended.. and it was a pizza with Prosciutto, arugula and fresh white aged cheddar (I think).  The ingredients were so fresh that one would think they were picked out that day.  My first bite into the pizza gave me body chills - it was AMAZING.  I WILL definitely try every single pizza on that menu in months to come.  TRY this.  SO F**kIN good :)"}
{"text":"This place is within a stone's throw from my office so I've eaten here twice.  First experience was decent - simple lunch with an order of the Insalata di Tonno ($12) and a Margherita pizza ($12) split between two people.  The restaurant was bustling but we received our food in a timely fashion and I thought the pizza was good.  Second time around, not so great.  We booked a group lunch for 12 people at 12:30pm.  Arrived on time and put in our orders.  Food did not even start arriving at the table until 1:30pm, and the entrees came out one by one.  Our server did nothing to help the situation...he brought us one round of bread and a few pitchers of ice water.  We had to ask several times for refills, which were quickly forgotten about.    The only explanation that our server could offer was \"It's lunch time, we are very busy...we have 2 other large parties ahead of you\".  Ok, that's fine but we did make reservations and they knew we were coming so the fact that they didn't make any adjustments to accommodate the big parties seems like a pretty poor excuse to me.  The entrees were inconsistent.  A majority of us ordered the lunch special which was a 1/2 pizza, with salad and bruschetta.  Some specials came with bruschetta, some did not.  My Cesar salad was very limp and plain (no cheese or croutons) and the dressing tasted Kraft-y.  Disappointing to say the least.  The Sfizio website states that they have gluten-free pizza options (additional cost of $5) but when we inquired, the server checked with the kitchen and said that it was not available so two people in our party were reduced to ordering salads.   At the end of our meal (almost 2 hours after we first arrived), as they were collecting our plates, there were still no apologies.  Our server simply said that it was out of his control and there was NOTHING that he could do.    I believe there was something he (or the restaurant) could have done to rectify the situation (complimentary appetizers or dessert perhaps?).  The only solution he offered - email us ahead of time with your group's order so we can prepare it ahead of time.  I'd pass on doing a large group meal here again.  They just didn't seem like they could handle the high customer volume or if they were having an off day, they don't seem to care about sending away happy customers and getting repeat business."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, but doesn't blow my mind.  I really only come here if people from  work want to go for lunch.     Don't order a pop.  They charge $4 for a regular can which is a huge rip off!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Not the cheapest but really good quality, nice wait staff, and good place to go to if you work in the area and want a sit down meal."}
