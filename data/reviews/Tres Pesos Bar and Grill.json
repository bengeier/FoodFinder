{"text":"I was headed to the hotel next door and asked the van driver if there were any good places to eat nearby.  He recommended Tres Pesos, he said the food was great and the bartenders were hot! OK, a must check out in my book. I have been twice.  Filling is the word.  Food is pretty good. Not going to knock your socks off but it is tasty and seems fresh.  Portions are large.  Great beers, good atmosphere.  Yes actually, my two bartenders have been very pleasant to look at as well!"}
{"text":"Great portion size for a reasonable price, and the food was good too. The service was as good as I could expect considering there were only two waitresses and the manager available during a rush. They also put up with a very disrespectful couple a lot better than I would have, so kudos to this Tres Pesos."}
{"text":"Service is terrible here. I've given them 3 chances to redeem themselves and nothing changed, so we're never coming back. The food is okay but the service is so bad, it's not worth returning."}
{"text":"Best Tacos I've ever had ! Just amazing, fresh ingredients  and amazing service . 100% recomended !!"}
{"text":"Place is good!..A little pricy for a Mexican Restaurant but good. Their Carne Asada is EXCELLENT! They're clean & the waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"Here's what I think of when I think about Tres Pesos: Cheap. Good Food. Huge Portions. Strong Margaritas. Bright Colors. Fast Service. 

My friend eats/drinks here a lot and he took me with him awhile back. He told me that he and his friend were drinking here one day and they had quite a few margaritas. After a few, they asked the bartender to add some more tequila to their drinks. She did- then said, \"Is that what you liiiiiiiike...\" I dunno, I just really like saying that now-

Is that what you liiiiiiiike (in Spanish accent)"}
{"text":"Service can be spotty, but the food is always good.  Another commenter referenced Azteca, and I would choose this restaurant 100% of the time over Azteca.  Definitely the best authentic Mexican in the area."}
{"text":"I've heard people say that the best Mexican food in Charlotte is off of South Boulevard, and while I think this might be true, Tres Pesos is not one of them. The outside is charming, with the bright colors and cute sign. I went for lunch, and a few tables were full here and there but I wouldn't say that it was crowded. I ordered off the lunch menu, which for a vegetarian, the entire menu is somewhat limiting. It took over an hour for me and a friend's food to come out of the kitchen, probably because it appeared as though it was our waitress's first day. She got our order wrong twice and had to have someone come over to our table and translate for us each time. My friend asked for sour cream and she brought ranch. This same behavior occurred even after our bill came. I noticed that I was overcharged by a little over $10, but it wasn't worth the hassle. Let's find another spot on South Boulevard."}
{"text":"No, don't eat here.  I was greeted by a man who was either the manager or the owner. He was very likable and wanted to make sure I was served immediately. 
 A young woman came to take my order (which was to go)
She couldn't speak English very well and need another waitress to translate.
They were both awesome.
My problem was the food.
Gross. I wonder what was the meat in my burrito REALLY. 
It could have been anything, or anyone fore that matter.
The food was bland and mysterious. However,
After 7 margaritas the food might be a little better. Maybe.
Gag me."}
{"text":"Visited here today and I was extremely dissatisfied with the food and service.  I ordered a Taco salad which came like a bowl of soup.  It had an awful taste to the point where I threw most of it away.  The server sat us and never asked if we wanted drinks until we had to flag her down. 
This is my first and last visit!!"}
{"text":"I'm only deducting a star because of the slow service. No matter how great the food in a restaurant is, slow service will kill your business. But the food here is by far the best I have had anywhere around Gaston, Cleveland, or Mecklenburg counties. It blows Los Arcos and South of the Border out of the water. All fresh ingredients, homemade flour tortillas, and every bite was delightful. I had the fajitas, and my wife had a beef chimichanga. Both meals were as good as they get. It's a shame about the location since the shopping center across the road closed, and it's a shame about the poor service. The service, they could fix. The location, not so much."}
{"text":"Primera vez comiendo en el local de gastonia, y definitiva mente no vuelvo! El Peor servicio que he recibido por una tal julianna. Los mariscos Esteban delisiosos, Eso si no lo puedo negar. Pero Que Pena que meseras como esta esten representando este negocio y le arruinen la experiencia a uno. Para Los futuros clientes por favor si les toca esta mesera cuando le esten pagando la cuenta y no desean que Ella se quede con su cambio haganla saber porque Ella no me regreso mi cambio y me toco decirle que porfavor me lo regresara que su propina se la deje en la mesa."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people are giving this place bad reviews. Went in before my flight for dinner and it was good. I got the chicken quesadilla dinner combo and it wasn't bad at all, just your typical Mexican place. The waitress was attentive and courteous! And a big plus, the large beer on tap was huge and pretty cheap. If you're looking for a quick and simple bite, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. I should've known from the start with the  V8 salsa that I should've spent my lunch hour and money elsewhere. The \"veggie\" burrito only has lettuce, tomatos and rice - oh, and V8 sauce on top. If you want a REAL veggie burrito... go to Loco Lime in Huntersville. Best Mexican cuisine I've had in a long time. I was unable to give less than 1 star for this place, by the way."}
{"text":"Sat down to sticker shock on the menu. The waitress was supposedly new. The food is sub-par. If I had known I would be paying this much for bad food and worse service, I would have went to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Trees Pesos. 1st I'll talk about the food, then I'll talk about the service...

The food - Very good, with the exception of the salsa. As others have stated, it is very thin. It's flavorful, but the texture is lacking and it runs off of the chip when you dip it. Great fajitas at a very reasonable price.

The service - The waitresses are the primary reason I come there. There are a couple girls that are VERY attractive. They have those perfect, curvy Latina bodies. However, they need to smile more. They would be so much prettier and inviting if they smiled a little more and maybe sat down for a second to ask me how my day is going. I myself am very handsome me, so I would think that they would be more interested. Maybe they are shy. In any case, I'm gonna keep working on them and continue to come back :)

EDIT: I guess Yelp didn't like me talking about the hot waitresses.  I don't know why.  Attractive wait staff is the primary reason I go to restaurants..."}
{"text":"Montezuma's revenge is the lunch special. Wan wah. Eat with caution. While recently visiting the Tres Pesos, service was not ideal; below average with the waitress ignoring most customers while disappearing for most of the time we were there. Too bad--that would at least be worth +1 in star-ratings. Overall the food is not what I would call incredibly delicious or superbly authentic. I am not a Mexican foodie but, at the very least, I believe I know good food when I taste it. This was not the case. I would guess they make most of their money from the lunch crowd--local business execs and other salarymen--looking for a bite to eat between cranking out spreadsheets and inarticulate powerpoint slides."}
{"text":"We came here on Sunday to grab a quick bite to eat after a long drive back from the beach. It was a great expereince but not a horrible one either.

Decked out in our Luke Kuechly jerseys, we decided to grab a seat at the bar to watch the Panthers game (yes, we won!!). The game was on a basic channel but the waitress (after 30 seconds of trying) gave up finding it for us and just handed the remote to my husband. I recognize this isn't a sports bar but there were like 15 tvs in this place all on ridiculous channels and we are the home to the Panthers! About 15 people started watching and cheering the second we turned the game on!

We ordered two beers. Didn't realize that when we ordered the bigger size, it would be a full 32 oz of beer. Not really complaining here cause both my husband and I love some beer and finished them. Just know the big beer is definitely big. Had to ask for limes for Dos Equis and Modelo. Pretty bare minimum service from the bartender.

Chips and salsa came out. Salsa had flavor but was super watery. We also got the queso with bean dip. Huge portion. Just ok. It was crazy crazy thick. I think i could have turned it upside down for 20 minutes and it wouldnt have moved. The beans dilluted the queso some, which made it a bit tastier.

We split the shrimp burrito, which came with rice and beans. Definitely a big enough portion for two. The burrito wasnt particularly good though. Kinda an odd mix of flavors and the shrimp were the baby kind. Not the best quality but the burrito was like $10 so guess I can't really blame them. 

Took us a while to finish those beers after we ate but we had the game on and met a few people! Even though this place is close to our house, we most likely will not return."}
{"text":"Very pricey. Servers aren't attentive. If you order one thing, they bring something else. Food was good. Will go again!"}
{"text":"just, well, gross.  

The food was just downright awful.  I got a chicken burrito & the chicken was weird & disgusting & I got sick halfway through eating.  

There are plenty of Mexican & pseudo Mexican restaurants in Charlotte to go to, choose them instead."}
{"text":"I only selected one star as I couldn't choose 0! 
- not friendly 
- sat us took our drink order, returned 15 mins later told it was best we left as they had one cook
- the only table that didn't get served 
-requested manager and told there wasn't one
** we were the the only non- Hispanics in the restaurant** 

I WILL NEVER RETURN, absolutely absurd service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restraunt in town.  It is so good I have not tried any of the others while visiting Gastonia.  The street tacos are on point and so is the customer service."}
{"text":"Some of the food is 5 star, but the overall experience is a solid 3 or less. I've actually walked out 15 minutes after being seated and no one acknowledging us despite multiple servers walking by. 

However, there are several pros. The chalupa is crispy and a perfectly balanced mix of flavors and freshness. The vegetarian fajitas have a great variety of vegetables. And the salsa bar is great. Being able to mix the regular salsa with chipotle and tomatillo allows you to customize your salsa exactly how you like it. 

I've also had good luck with modifications to the menu. I ordered the pick 2 - chalupa and chimichanga - and the server accommodated me in making it vegetarian with grilled onions, pepper and other veggies. 

I've read the bad reviews, but if you know what to order and if your service expectations are low, Tres Pesos is definitely the best value Mexican in the South Blvd area."}
{"text":"Stopped here because it was a better option than IHOP, not expecting much. The crowd was not great. The waitress was amazing. She did not let my drink get more than half empty the whole night. The salsa was awesome. It was spicy in all the right ways. I ordered the chicken enchiladas especialles. It was wonderful ! What really completed the meal though was the fact that the rice and beans were wonderful. They were not bland like I've had at most places. All around a wonderful meal. You should go there."}
{"text":"Very nice lunch!

The waitress Angie was very nice, I will repeat!

Loved the Tacos and the outside eating area."}
{"text":"The food is both good and cheap.  Special requests like \"hold the onions\" or \"no cheese\" are hit or miss although they will correct it if they bring it out wrong.  Our waitress was great and that's what she did.

The chips are homemade and come out of the kitchen warm and crispy.  Two salsas, one is diced tomatoes and not a lot else but it's refreshing.  The other is a traditional style red salsa with cilantro and a spicy kick.

Ground beef tacos are tangy and the chicken tacos a little runny but taste great.  The real winner however was the steak tacos.  I've asked for soft corn tortillas twice and gotten white flour both times so the kitchen can be a little random.  For the price it's worth a trip, just keep your expectations aligned with the value.  How much can you really complain about $2 tacos..."}
{"text":"Used to go here years ago and loved it then, this time totally different. Waitress was horrible, so was the waitress for the table next to ours. Bathrooms were beyond disgusting. Will never return!!!!"}
{"text":"Alright mexican food.  Costs a little more than it should.  I think Azteca across the street is better if you are looking for some good and cheap mexican."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying that, though I'm generally not picky when it comes to food, I'm very selective when it comes to Mexican food as it is my least favorite.  I don't typically enjoy Mexican food for whatever reason, but Tres Pecos made me forget about that when my coworkers took me there for lunch last week.

We were immediately served hot tortilla chips with an excellent fresh salsa.  I could eat that salsa every day.

I ordered their soft taco lunch special - specifically one beef taco and one chicken taco.  Both were great and were served with rice and refried beans.  I thought the whole meal was great.  I do plan to return soon."}
{"text":"Tres Pesos.....not even worth un peso!!!!

On Cinco De Mayo 6 ladies were looking for mexican cuisine and got no utensils to eat any of it with!!  To not be able to serve us any drinks the entire night and have to wait so long that we were about to get up and walk out (some people did) was a disgrace.  We finally had to get our own drinks, own utensils and had to find our own food!  The manager said that he'd 'take care of it'....what that meant was get us a \"free drink\" that we ended up having to pay for in the end!  They could have made a lot of money out of us if they had only paid attention to our empty drinks.  Half of our food was not brought out but of course they tried to charge us for it.  Then when we wanted to pay and get out it took them an hour to put it together.  Of all days the manager decided to train the girl on our bill.  Then to add salt to the wound we were charged an 18% gratuity with our bill...and this may have been because they knew they did not deserve it and would not have gotten that much had they let us decide what to give them.....un peso.

In all honesty the food was worth about 4 stars but the service is not even worth one!  Service is what makes the experience and this was the worst.  Azteca was busier than this place and we probably could have gotten a seat, had awesome food and left the same time we ended up leaving this place.  I would avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this one star because I was forced to...this restaurant doesn't even deserve that. I went to this restaurant with two people, we were the only people in there. Our waitress brought us a tiny serving of a bowl of salsa and chips, and then took our order. A minute later she comes back to clarify what I had just told her I wanted (she probably should have written down our orders). So, we finish our chips and salsa and our drinks and just sit there waiting...wondering where our waitress went. My friend looks over at the bar and sees our waitress sitting down, talking to the bartender, and having herself a liquor drink. Needless to say we left. If the quality of their service is any indication of the quality of their food then I'm glad we left when we did."}
{"text":"I've been to lunch here a few times. Service is usually fairly quick. 

Not a fan of their margaritas, which is a pretty big negative when having Mexican!

Lunch menu is pretty standard and decently priced"}
{"text":"We are writing this review as we walk out the door. Waited 45 Mins for chorizo. Server forgot what we ordered 4 times. Pretty disappointed"}
{"text":"Sitting in here now. The place is unwelcoming. Service is the worst and the slooooowest.  I had to ask how much longer before we would eat. Immediately our food came out. By the crust on the beans you can tell it's been sitting in the kitchen. I'm still waiting to see a smile on the only server that was working. In the meantime, the food is bland with no taste. I ordered shrimps that were so overlooked. It was totally dry. Needless to say, unless you're a gluten for bad food & worst service, I wouldn't recommend this place. I wanted to try it for the longest. I did until I woke up. By the way, the pina colada???...they forgot the pina."}
{"text":"This restaurant has poor management and the costumer service is real bad! The waitresses are young girls that are more concerned about their looks and friends that visit them at the restaurant that with the costumer, their rud and arrogant, the atmosphere is obscure and they have 100 televisions trough the entire restaurant fixed in one Chanel... Menus is extent and food is mediocrely prepare. I have a vuelve a la vida cocktail mixto and it was just blah!    They forgot to use the most essential Mexican ingredient and asked the waitress for that and she just nodded and and ignored me, talk to the manager and he brought the ingredient with no apologizing for their sake"}
{"text":"No.  Just.  No.

I work relatively close to Tres Pesos and years ago we used to visit at least once a month until the server's skirts got shorter, tops got tighter and boobs got boobier.  While I am sure the tips increased dramatically (the clientele was almost only men on our last visit a while ago), the food just got worse and worse, so we started going across the street to Azteca, where they now scream \"Amy\" when I walk in and make a place at the end of the bar for me (not really, but we do go there more often than we should).  Trying to try new places, and give old places another chance, I stopped in at Tres Pesos for lunch today.  

The interior, while it hasn't really been updated, seems to be different.  It looks like they maybe did some renovation and moved the bar?  I dunno.... The waitresses were fully clothed, which may be why the place was practically empty at 12:15.  I sat down and needed some chips.  The chips were warm and delivered immediately, though they seemed a little greasy.  Served with the liquidy salsa and the chunky tomato/onion/ciliantro pico (?), both were heavy on the cilantro, so I ate neither.  I ordered the queso, which to their credit is served in a small size for only $2 instead of the large bowl for $4 in case you are dining alone or not wanting to share your cheese dip.  The cheese dip was meh - very thick.  Nothing wrong with it, just nothing special.  The beef chimichanga was a hot mess.  Served with rice and beans, the rice was fine, the beans were runny (not appetizing).  The chimichanga, which is essentially a deep fried burrito, was covered with lettuce and such, sour cream on top of that, red sauce and then tomato slices, which completely saturated the chimichanga and made the fried outer shell mushy.  I like the crisp, which is why I got a fried dish - if I wanted a soft exterior, I would have ordered a burrito.  Meat filling was ... not in my top 10.  

Service was fine, I didn't run out of drink and that is important, but I found myself waiting for a bit for the check and then for her to pick it up.  Nothing was offensive or horrible, but overall it was just meh.  I should have gone to Azteca across the street or made the drive to Monterrey in Pineville.  Bleh."}
{"text":"Great lunch at good price.  Service very attentive and friendly.  Very welcoming, laid back atmosphere.  

-and I eat a lot of Mexican"}
{"text":"I was visiting Gastonia for a wedding, and my fellow bridesmaids and my boyfriend came with me to this restaurant. The food was absolutely delicious and flavorful, the server was attentive, and the margarita was delicious and strong! In addition there was an extensive menu that consisted of way more than the usual tacos and enchiladas. I had the molcajete huichol, which was piping hot, spicy and amazing! My friends both had the whole snapper, which was called huachinango. My boyfriend had the enchiladas rojos. We also got the guacamole and both types of empanadas. I would definitely come back, next time I come to NC."}
{"text":"I went to Tres Pesos for the first time. I was seriously disappointed. I sat at the bar and the bartender acted like my party was a burden to her. At one point in the meal she rolled her eyes when my boyfriend asked her to correct our order. 

The fajitas were very greasy, and the service was bad."}
{"text":"Just mediocre, will not be my new home away from home. Miss my Rio Grande in Nitro WV"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner and everything we ordered was borderline inedible. Cheese dip is watery, chicken on all dishes was flavorless, and orders came out wrong."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. Food is bland and tasteless and service is very poor. Waitress actually argued with me about my food allergy insisting that I could eat an entree with an ingredient I'm allergic to!  If you want to stuff your gut with a lot of nothing for a cheap price, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I don't know what all the other bad reviews are about but I had Tres Pesos last night and was very satisfied. The chips and salsa brought out on the house were quite good. The chips were warm and the salsa was flavorful and spicy. I ordered the chimichanga but had them make it vegetarian style. Inside it was stuffed with re-fried beans, onions, bell peppers and mushrooms. on top it was layered with a nice cheese sauce. On the side my dish came with beans and rice with guacamole and sour cream with lettuce and tomatoes. I left happy and will definitely return!!!! On top of all of that my server was awesome!"}
{"text":"just tried this place for the first time and it's pretty solid for lunch. They have several lunch specials for 4.99 with free tea (tea- not soda) and chips and salsa. I got the chicken fajitas  and they were pretty good. not the best Mexican food ever, but pretty damn great for the price. The toppings could have been better.  Lettuce looked a little sad but I've noticed that at a lot of places including grocers right now. No cheese, but still...very good for the price. my only complaint is that they only brought me 2 tortillas for my fajitas and when I asked for one more I was told they were extra and came 4 to an order. Fine. Now to be honest these tortillas were so piping hot and delicious that I ate the other 3 plain and they were well worth the $1.50. It just bothers me that they originally only brought me two and they could only bring extra in a four-count. Service was average and I would come back for lunch."}
{"text":"I was sad to see that Fiesta Margarita had closed.  But decided to give Tres Pesos a try at the recomendation of a friend.  I'm glad I did.

As anyone knows whos read any of my reviews, I love spicy food. A particular favorite when eating out at a Mexican restaurant is the chips and salsa. I am often left wanting when they bring their \"hottest\" salsa to the table. But I ask every time anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised at Tres Pesos when they brought a salsa that was full of flavor and most importantly, heat!  For my entre' I ordered the Burrito Fajita. It too was large and filled with fresh ingredients.  The flavor was very good!  The staff was helpful and checked on us often enough to ensure we're not needing something but not so much as to become a bother.

In short, we will certainly be back!  If you like Mexican, you won't make a mistake by giving Tres Pesos a try!"}
{"text":"We came to Tres Pesos because it is always packed when we drive by.  We looked at the reviews beforehand and saw they were awful, but the majority were all several years old so we gave it a chance.  The old reviews are still applicable as of today.  The food had zero flavoring.  The chicken enchiladas and burrito we ordered were filled with a shredded chicken that had zero seasoning.  The chicken was plain and dry.  The steak that was topping our chicken enchiladas more closely resembled beef jerky. Refried beans had zero seasoning and the rice had zero seasoning too.  The only redeeming quality was that the service was good. If you like big plates for not much money and don't care too much about flavor, then this is the place for you!  I would highly recommend driving a few hundred feet down the road to Azteca instead.  It's worth noting that we have to affiliation to Azteca, we just really enjoy their food."}
{"text":"Not great. Standard Mexican food, but the quality was not great tonight. Not many people here. Ordered chicken quesadilla that had too much cheese and pretty sure some of the chicken wasn't fully cooked. Nice atmosphere if more people were here. Lots of tabs and nice bar."}
{"text":"I've lived on Woodlawn Road for 10 years and tonight decided what the heck, why not check out Tres Pesos for the first time with my gf to sit at the bar--instead of going to Azteca where we would normally go on Woodlawn.  

Great atmosphere, great looking bar, better than average margaritas.

However, the bar tender rolled her eyes at me when I tried to get her attention to tell her I ordered corn and not the flour tortillas that were served.

The steak fajitas had NO flavor at all, and the onions and peppers were dripping with oil.  Picture unmarinated beef mixed with onions and peppers and dropped into the deep fryer.  

My gf called the manager over so we wouldn't have to deal with the rude bartender again.  The bartender claimed nobody else complained about the fajitas all day, so why are we?  

Thanks Tres Pesos, way to show customers who point out problems with your food that their comments are not welcome."}
{"text":"First of all don't have everything on menú, sea food not fresh at all, it looks old and store bought. They use same sauces for everything. Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"If the wait across the street at Azteca is too long, wander over to Tres Pesos. Bright colors and attentive service, I was pretty pleased with the meal I enjoyed here. And you certainly can't beat the price!

I can't agree with previous reviews of the salsa. While it wasn't the way I would make it, the salsa I was served was large-ish chunks of tomato and small pieces of onion and spices. Yes, there was a good amount of water in the bottom, but the stuff above the waterline was spicy and hit the spot with the chips while I waited for my entree.

My margarita was massively huge though I'd say it probably only had one pour of tequila in it. I've never had one served with an orange and a cherry on the rim before. Weird.

The \"two enchilada combo\" also comes with a scoop of Mexican rice and a cute fried corn tortilla bowl of refried beans. It was satisfying, for being \"Americanized\" Mexican food.

Would I come here again? Sure, why not."}
{"text":"Tres Pesos is tasty, cheap and chill. The chips are homemade and delish, and they have a choice of 3 salsas: a chunky tomato and onion mix that's closer to pico di gallo, a traditional red salsa with cilantro, and a fiery green salsa that they'll bring if you request more heat, which is perfecto. The fishbowl margaritas come with fresh lime and the food, pretty standard Mexican fare, is what you'd expect: hearty and tasty, if not especially healthy. A reliable bet."}
{"text":"Well the environment was okay, the waitress was attentive but the food was disappointing, the  food came out  extra cold after about a 35-40 min wait, the margarita was beyond disappointing. Yeah I will never try this spot again. Don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"Food is good and the ladies working are very nice. I encourage you to go off the beaten path and try some of their traditional Mexican dishes especially their seafood. Their more Americanized dishes are not as good as other places I've had."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why so many people gave this place such bad reviews. I've been twice now and have enjoyed both times. The staff is super friendly, and willing to go the extra mile for you. Trust me, I tested that out! I'm always that person asking for a million side orders and they were more than happy to provide them here! 

The chips and salsa were so good! Both were definitely homemade. You can't go wrong with authentic salsa/chips. I saw a few comments about the salsa being too watery but that's just how authentic salsa is made, this isn't the first place I've been to where it was like that! 

I ordered the tacos, 2 chicken and 2 beef. Sooo good! The tortillas were my favorite, again homemade and delicious. Comes with a huge portion of rice and beans, also good. My boyfriend got the dinner combo of a quesadilla and small burrito. Both looked good but the portions were a little small comparing them to my meal.

The service wasn't bad at all. Our food came out quick, we did receive the wrong order the first time but that was quickly corrected and I had to ask for a few things multiple times before getting them. Other than that we really had no complaints. This is a little far from where we live so we probably won't go too much, but if I'm in the mood for some good Mexican, I'll definitely remember this spot!"}
{"text":"This place is in an old Steak & Ale restaurant on Woodlawn near I-77.  

Someone had told me that this place was just as good or better than Azteca which is a block away.  Ummm, NOT!!!!

When I got there, I was eating alone and the hostess led me all over the restaurant looking for an empty table.  We went back by the kitchen area and through an area that looked like it was used for storage until she finally sat me at the bar.  I really didn't want to have my first experience at this place at the bar. But oh well.

Like all other Mexican places, I received the complimentary chips and salsa which were mediocre at best.  I ordered an unsweetened iced tea that the bartender couldn't even take the time to refill.  

I ordered an enchilada dish and it had to be the most bland mexican food I've ever tasted.  

I've never had bad Mexican food until this place and the service or lack of service made this experience one of the worst.   

Ugh!"}
{"text":"From the outside this place may not look like much, but the food is good & comes at a great price. The tackiness makes this place stand out on Woodlawn & the inside doesn't disappoint in that category either. While a tad bit dark in the dining area, the tables & seats are all painted bright colors all in crazy designs. While this has nothing to do with why I like the place, it does make it feel like they're trying to get you to notice.

Nothing too exciting on the menu but your typical Mexican dishes, but the lunch menu prices are on point. You can come in hungry & leave full for cheap. They have free chips & salsa to pass the time till your food arrives, which is always a plus. I've never seen a long line here & I've almost always been seating immediately.

Tres Pesos tries bright colors to draw you in off Woodlawn, but their prices are why you'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Service with a smile food was tasty and fresh lots of different hot sauces very good. Fresh best describes this experience. Lots of smiles."}
{"text":"Please save yourself the aggravation and eat at the Taco Bell down the street. Honestly wish I could leave negative stars after the experience we just had. I worked in food service for years, including 3 National Pancake days at IHOP, and consider myself an extremely patient customer. There was a sign on the front door saying it would be about an hour for food, which we had no problem with, since it is cinco de mayo and other restaurants had 3-hour waits. Now I know why we were seated immediately at Tres Pesos. No one came to greet us for a good 20 minutes after we sat down and after our very unpleasant server finally took our orders, our food took TWO HOURS to get to the table. This might have been understandable, except the two tables on either side of ours were seated after us and had their food before we did. Empty drinks, bland food, a hair in my burrito, issues with the bill, a very off-putting staff - I don't think anyone could pay me tres millones de pesos to ever set foot in this awful place again."}
{"text":"Um.. Tres Pesos was terrible. My coworkers all seemd to really enjoy it, I having never been agreed to go here fo lunch. They whole heartedly reccomended the quesadilla. 

It was two toritallas backed with a small amount of chicken in the middle. A little white american cheese on top. Absolutely terrible. It wasn't even crispy. Who wants a quesadilla that is soggy, and without any real cheese? I'll never go here again. I hope nobody else does either."}
{"text":"Horchata had to much cinamon in it. The chulupa and chimichanga was on point and very yummy."}
{"text":"Margarita ok. Didn't ask me what size just brought a big one. Grilled chicken lunch special ok. Beans were thin for my liking but rice was nicely seasoned. Asked for hot salsa because what is brought to the table is very bland. The one person hit it right on with the flavor of tomato sauce and ketchup. Girl was very hesitant to bring the hot to me and seemed like she was trying to deter me from eating it saying it's very very hot. Ok I'll be that judge. Meh not so hot. Not sure how my bill ended up being over $16 for a margarita and a 4.99 lunch special but ok. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"good bang for the buck.  busy during lunch.  food generally good with exceptional lunch specials.  clearly NOT suit and tie place; but, you can get in-and-out for less than $8 bucks if you get the special."}
{"text":"Went to Old Mech Brewing and it was so crowded. On the way in we saw this spot so thought we'd give it a shot. Glad we did. Best salsa in charlotte  Huge Sangria. Big portions. Looks family owned. 

Casual"}
{"text":"This is based off our lunch 9/3/2015 visit.  The food was pretty good but the service was no bueno.  We waited over 30min just to get our order taken. It was very disappointing. I will give it another shot in the near future."}
{"text":"After coming here for years, I was disappointed my last visit.  Don't know what has happened, but the place has really lost all that was good about the place before.  The food has turned from being quite authentic (as much as that can be here in Charlotte) to being very plain and bland."}
{"text":"I RECOMMEND...........I have been in Gastonia since February and avoided this place because of the reviews.  However after trying every other restaurant in this city and being completely disappointed my husband and I decided to come here.  We should have never listened to the reviews and tried it out for ourselves.  We had lunch here today and we both were impressed.  I had the chicken fajitas for the 4.99 lunch special.  They gave me a full meal for that price with rice and beans.  My husband and I travel all over the United States with our job and have eaten at many Mexican restaurants.  This one is the best one we have experienced here in Gastonia.  It is authentic, fresh, and priced just right."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or your money.  The refried beans tasted sour, the chalupa was soggy on one side, the chimichanga had the toughest chicken I have ever experienced.  The best thing about my meal was the glass of water."}
{"text":"Do not believe any negative reviews...I am from houston Texas Home of Mexican Food This place is very inexpensive for lunch and Their portions are Great! Queso dip was the truth and their habanero sauce is homemade! Do not go to on the Border or taco bell or los arcos buffet cause none of those places show love like this place....I am a stickler when it comes to food cause ive been in 44 states and I eat out everyday This is where to get your mexican fix!"}
{"text":"Seriously? 

Three pesos is about what I would actually pay for a meal here.
This is not Mexican Food. This is not even American food categorized as Mexican food. This is pure crap.

The salsa came in 2 flavors: water and chunky water.
Shame on you. If you poured Food Lion brand salsa straight out of a jar it would taste better. Sorry guys, V8 is not technically salsa.

OK I'm done..not even worth writing about my burrito which looked like a turd and tasted close to one."}
{"text":"I tried this place on Sunday night about 8 PM and to my surprise it was very busy.  I even think they had live music going on in another part of the restaurant.  The dinner started with some nice hot fresh chips with great salsa (always a good start) my girlfriend and I each ordered an entrée and the meal came out about 10 minutes later.  Everything was pretty good and the service was quick.  It wasn't the best Mexican food I've ever had but I don't have any complaints and I would return again."}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed a restaurant in a while... Then again, I hadn't been in a shithole as god-awful as Tres Pesos. I only gave it a 1 star because otherwise, I wouldn't let me a review. I wish they had a negative star system or even better yet, a shut this fuckin' dump down button.

Wait staff is rude and dry and not very serviceable. The hostess sat us down and our waitress didn't come by our table for approximately 10 minutes. THE PLACE WAS EMPTY!!! There was more staff than customers.

She finally comes then it takes her another 15 minutes to bring us the chips and the disgusting ketchup they pass off as salsa. With a massive chunk of a tomato right in the middle to boot. I kid you not, it's ketchup... with cilantro and onion. Ketchup....

I tried to order a torta... they don't have it. Mind you, not an, \"I'm sorry, we are out\" or anything. Just got cut off in the middle of my sentence, \"we don't have them\". So, I told her to put my fiancee's order in (she'd ordered first) and I will continue to decide. 

15 minutes later, she's back. I tried to order tacos, the order comes with four fo them, I started saying I wanted 1 of asada, again, cut off in the middle of a sentence, \"you can only order two of a kind\". So, I said, ok and asked for two of those and two of lengua... cut off again, \"no, we don't have lengua\". I handed her back the menu and thanked her, but I was not going to order at that point and just to bring my fiancee her food.

Food finally arrives and it's a soggy, disgusting, clusterfuck of ketchup, rice, onions, peppers, chicken and cheese... I mean, it looked like vomit. The fiancee said it didn't taste as bad as it looked, but it was not very good. I refused to try it when she offered as it was visually very off-putting.

So, walked out hungry and annoyed as this was a pretty lame experience. For those of you who said you had a good experience, it makes me want to believe you've never actually received good service or good food anywhere else in order to believe this is acceptable...

NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Waste of time in my book. A lot of food doesn't make up for it not tasting good and most if it being canned and pre-cooked food."}
{"text":"So we went here for Cinco De Mayo, with a group of about 8. Upon arriving the service seemed to be ok, but then once we got seated our waitress took our order for drinks, which took about 45 minutes to get. Than when my wife ordered her food it didn't come as described in the menu."}
{"text":"\"The salsa came in 2 flavors: water and chunky water.\" Dave K., I salute you. You are so right about this joint. It's awful. 
While the front of the house is cute enough, the main dining room was just depressing. After we were seated, our waitress came over and scowled at us! No smile, no hello, just the ol' stink eye. To break the tension, I asked about the margaritas. After ordering drinks, we sampled the salsas, which were so bland and nondescript we ordered guacamole. Which was also flavorless--and not fresh.
There was virtually no distinct taste to anything--at least nothing strong enough to distinguish one dish from another. We ordered combo platters so we could sample a variety of things but the only variety was in the texture of the different items. The margaritas were salted with table salt and tasted only of bottled mixer--I couldn't detect any tequila whatsoever on my tongue or in my brain (16 ounces of margarita should provide a buzz!).
I will never stray from AZTECA again!"}
{"text":"I think the 3 stars kinda says it all really: I've had better and I've had worse.  Portions were generous for the price and the food was good, but there was something missing from the whole thing.  There just wasn't a punch to the food that made it memorable.  However the salsa fresca was great and the chips were warm and tasty.

Would I recommend someone go here?  How about this; I wouldn't recommend against it."}
{"text":"I have nothing positive to say about this place. It is not authentic Mexican food, Servers are not friendly and food is as bad as it can get. pricier for the food they offer, so save your self a bad experience .. Definitely not comming back."}
{"text":"Hot waitress lukewarm food. I wont go back tho."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite on Friday , since I wanted tacos and fresh pico De gallo. The margarita was Texas Size, but it wasn't strong enough. I ordered shrimp and beef tacos, portions were really good. Rice and beans are done well. I'll go back for the rice alone, but the margarita needs to be a little bit stronger."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I don't frequent Mexican restaurants, so I can't really compare TP's to many others in town.  That said, they seemed QUITE AVERAGE & I noticed nothing that wowed me at all. There were the usual chips & salsa (two kinds) brought out before the food.  Had lunch with a friend and ordered the grilled \"large\" chicken quesadilla. Hmm...quite plain actually, I was kind of surprised.  The only thing on/in it was cheese and chicken, with a VERY small smattering of lettuce and tomato along the edges of the plate; more decoration than anything.  Asked for the sour cream to be on the side but that didn't happen - slightly annoying but not a huge deal.  I mean overall it was ok, but there just wasn't anything TO it for $7...fairly cheap but I was underwhelmed.  I've had much better quesadilla's as appetizers at non-Mexican restaurants...and made much better ones at home if I do say so myself.  Ok, so is TP a bad spot, no.  Is it a place I would make an effort to go back to, NO."}
{"text":"I stopped at Tres Pesos on my way home from work one night to get a delicious addition to dinner of chips, cheese dip and salsa. I thought it would be a relatively quick transaction; however, it took over 10 minutes for my to go bag to be brought to me. The chips were hot, salsa was pretty good, the cheese dip was average. Unfortunately, 4 days later, I check my online banking to see that my card was overcharged $5. After I had already tipped $2 for a TO-GO order! Unbelievable. I will definitely not be returning. If you do stop in, be sure to check your bank statement!


EDIT: After speaking with the owners of Tres Pesos after this incident, they did everything possible to ensure I was taken care of. I was returned the full amount and actually spoke with the owners several times to ensure everything was taken care of. I plan to return to give Tres Pesos a fair review. They definitely provided some of the best customer service I've seen from a restaurant and went WAY out of their way to make sure I was happy in the end. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Ugh. Go across the street to Azteca if you want good Mexican food.
The last time I went to Tres Pesos, the salsa was watery and had no
taste at all.  The burrito was nothing to brag about.

When the waitress took our money, we had to hunt her down to get our
change back.  She acted as if we hadn't paid.  

No thanks."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good - I split the large size ceviche with my husband (it's a huge portion - we even took some home). Service was terrible, waitress seemed uninterested and unhappy to be there. Very slow for everything (even though it was a Tuesday night and NOT busy at all).  Probably will not return and would not recommend it to anyone. The bad service just turned me off completely. Sorry Tres Pesos - you really MUST re-train or re-staff."}
