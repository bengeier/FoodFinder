{"text":"I had the Vegan Thanksgiving dinner... I couldn't have been happier! Tofurkey with stuffing and cranberry sauce, delicious mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy, garlic Brussel sprouts, sweet potato soup and pumpkin pie. I got to go, but the place is cute, the owner/chef is clearly producing quality food at really good prices, vegan and veggie friendly, I LOVE THIS PLACE! I'll be coming here regularly from now on!"}
{"text":"Very good vegan menu. I had the black bean burger with slaw and potato salad. The potion was almost to big. Going to try the tofu burger next. Also they have many great options for the non vegan. Not much to look at from outside but great service and food on the inside. Great job!"}
{"text":"Went to Earth Bistro Cafe for the first time tonight now I can't wait to go back. The menu mostly consists of vegan/vegetarian options. All the food is fresh and delicious. All sandwiches come with pasta salad and the most delicious cole slaw I've ever had made with fresh dill. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are large. Service was excellent. I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"This is my go to on a busy night that I cannot find time to cook myself but want to keep it delicious and healthy. I am currently stuffing my face with the fried tofu sandwich, and it is absolutely delicious. The veggie burger and veggie burrito are my usual go-to's, but I am happy that I ventured out of my comfort zone. The owners are very talented in the kitchen, years of experience to back them up. So so happy to have them in Cleveland's Edgewater neighborhood."}
{"text":"Omg.... the food here is amazing!!! I have been here a few times over the last few years and every time they do not disappoint! The owners are friendly and the bistro is so welcoming."}
{"text":"Vegetarian or not, you'll love the food.  Super healthy but really really tasty.  I got one of the fresh juice drinks and grilled veggie panini that was delicious and came with a couple sides.  Cuban style guacamole to start which came with some banana chips, carrots and pita bread.  Ambiance was cool and they played some great music and the waiter was super friendly and enthusiastic about helping us out.  Great job Earth Bistro -- loved it!"}
{"text":"Love this menu of healthy food with so many options, but more than that the recipes are really interesting! Not just blah health food but inspired ethnic fusion creations.  Veggie burger made from scratch is best ever. Cole slaw with lots of dill is amazing. Hummus and guacamole worth writing home about. Seriously a new fave stop! Plan for a bit of time due to chill vibe and truly fresh made food. And don't forget to try a juice blend option! Thank you guys for being so nice to our fairly large party, and the great business you do. ;)e rin"}
{"text":"Love having lunch in here. Chicken chilli is theeeeeee best! Service is quick and polite and I like the cozy decor.  I wish there was a slightly larger menu and they has the chicken chilli more often, though."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Hadn't been in this building since it was named Truffles. The new owner has done a really nice job of brightening the place up, with white walls, and linen-upholstered chairs and booths. There are some beachy accents on the walls, which I enjoyed.  The music playing on the sound system was a bit of a divergence from the decor. Not sure how you'd describe it...modern? Indie? Some Fiona Apple and U2 throwbacks.  Anyway. I didn't dislike it.  The menu is pretty expansive for a bistro, with a lot of healthy, vegetarian, and even vegan options.  That being said, I opted for the Cuban panini.  The meat tasted like it was high-quality, the bread was both crisp and chewy (mmm), and a slice of pineapple on each sandwich half was a nice touch.  The sandwich came with pasta salad, which was loaded with veggies, and a dill slaw that wasn't mayonnaisey at all. I was pretty full by the end, but no leftovers.  I probably could have wrapped up a sandwich half, though, if I was less hungry.  The cafe also boasts a variety of specialty juices and coffees.  I can't remember the name of it, but I tried the one with grapefruit and cucumber.  It was tart and very refreshing.  When the owner brought our drinks, I appreciated that he was wearing plastic gloves -- it showed me they're concerned with cleanliness.  He was quite friendly and attentive as well.  Only small downside was the price -- around $30 for our two lunches and drinks. But the quality of the food was clear, the service was really great...and they are still somewhat new to the neighborhood.  Once they have a solid customer base, who knows what may happen.  I definitely recommend trying them out. A delicious experience overall."}
{"text":"Tofu never tasted so good!!!!  I will crave it, from this great little gem!  Friendly personable service!  Get here now...with food this good the restaurant will move downtown, double their prices and it would still be worth every penny!!  BTW...I liked it;-)"}
{"text":"So glad this place is back!! Excellent food from vegan to carnivore. Healthy and fresh. We loved it before and we really missed it when it was gone. Vegan burrito, vegan cheesecake, and black bean burger are the best."}
{"text":"A friend & I had lunch there yesterday. Food was outstanding! As we are both vegans it was wonderful to have such a big selection to choose from. The portions were huge we both brought leftovers home. That being said we both had to try their desserts. Delicious!!! The dining room is cozy & inviting. I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants for vegans in Cleveland. I wish this place were completely vegan, I would spend all of my money here. Given the reviews and the clientele, I don't know why they aren't just a vegan restaurant, I'm sure they'd do quite well. That's the only negative about places that serve non-vegan food, there is always this air of doubt when eating something that very closely resembles its non-vegan counterpart.  Oh yeah, the buffalo chikun sandwich is my favorite thing to eat here so far, with macaroni salad!"}
{"text":"This restaurant will easily be my go to for delicious vegan food. I had the Veggie Burger, side of fries and slaw w/unsweetened ice tea & it was solo delicious. The burger made of a variety of roasted or grilled veggies offered an intricate flavor profile that my newly vegan palate had not experienced before & I was very pleased.  To top it off, I finished my meal with a slice of the vegan oreo cake, made in house, it was delectable...everything was pleasing to the eye & belly.   The restaurant is beautiful & earthy, clean & peaceful which I love.  The owner was very attentive, friendly & kind.  I can't wait to revisit w/friends."}
{"text":"Delicious food and food you feel good about even when you clean plate.  I want to try more on the menu but I am so hung up on the deliciousness of the vegan burrito and the tostados.  Guacamole is great too - who knew pineapple was such a great addition.  This place.  THIS PLACE. You need to go.  My new favorite Cleveland restaurant - good for dining in and takeout."}
{"text":"Love the menu choices; extensive, good variety and healthy options; seems that everything is made to order. I enjoyed the fiesta salad, with the different textures and flavors which blended well. The vegetables were very fresh and the chipotle aioli was light and didn't overpower the salad. It was an enormous portion, twice as much as I could eat in one sitting. On a previous visit I tried their grilled vegetable panini which was delicious, but my favorite item on the plate was the coleslaw. This is now one of my favorite restaurants when I am visiting the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"The Chocalate cake with strawberrys and choc. Sauce is the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD... The Vegan food is excellent also...try it you wont regret it. $$"}
{"text":"My mom and I tried Earth Bistro Cafe the other night for dinner. Our food was delicious! We had the guacamole with roasted pineapple (came with a side of pita and plantain chips), a house salad, and the vegan tostadas with a side of cactus slaw. We also had the opportunity to taste their homemade dips, including the tapenade and hummus. Both were very good!   In all, everything was really tasty and I am very excited to have an awesome vegan restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The owners take a lot of pride in this place and it really shows! They renovated the place themselves with earth-friendly reuses materials. It looks great.   The food here is also really tasty.  I had a burger with grilled tofu and pesto. I loved it. It was paired with a pickle/cabbage coleslaw that I really enjoyed, which impressed me because I normally hate coleslaw. I took my leftovers home with me, including the coleslaw. (You will have leftovers. I don't think it's possible to leave this place hungry.)  There are lots of options here - vegan, gluten free, vegetarian, and omnivore. The owners are also really thoughtful about the food. One of them ran out of the kitchen to check with me before serving my burger because apparently there were peanuts in one of the sauces and he wanted to make sure I wasn't allergic. How thoughtful. Can't beat that kind of service!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal. All of the ingredients were super fresh and all of the flavors blended together nicely. I wish I would have taken a photo of how beautiful the house salad was arranged. Very good deal on the house salad as well. $6 for a large portion and beautifully sliced avocado on top. The side salad comes with toast topped with a sun dried tomato tapenade that is to die for. I got the Vegan Burrito and my boyfriend, who is a meat-eater, got the Veggie Burger. We were both thrilled with our selections and will definitely be back! I should add that this is the first new place I've tried in a while that I wasn't disappointed. As a vegetarian, it's not often that I find a menu with so many high-vibrational options."}
{"text":"Soo good. I had the black bean burger with slaw and potato salad. It was perfection. The interior of this place is adorably eclectic. They have juices and coffees that look amazing, along with wonderful sounding desserts. They have a complete vegan menu as well as a side with meat involved. Yum. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great selection of food for herbivores and carnivores. There is a man that works there who is not only personable but hilarious. If you're in the area of Lakewood and have maybe 30 to kill and are hungry I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to try this restaurant for her birthday as she is a vegan . The food was wry fresh and wonderful and the service was, too! What a great find!  I would definitely recommend Earth Bistro Cafe to my friends and family! There are vegetarian and meat selections, so give it a try and you'll definitely be pleased."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of a kind in Cleveland, and one of my favorite spots to get a meal. The ingredients are fresh and healthy and the portions are large. This is the only place in Cleveland where there is quality, healthy ingredients for such cheap prices (~$10 an entree!). I wish there were more places like Earth Bistro! I travel all the way from the East Side (25 minutes) to eat here. I hope to see this restaurant grow and expand in the near future! The only downside is the ambiance in the restaurant (it is small, etc), but the two men who own the restaurant are constantly improving it."}
{"text":"I found Earth Bistro Cafe (on Yelp!) last weekend, as my husband and I were driving from New Jersey to Nebraska and looking for vegan food along the way. I stopped in and ordered the vegan quesadilla and vegan veggie panini to go.  I was so impressed with this place! The guys who run it are total sweethearts (I came in right as they opened, so we chatted while they got the food ready), and our meals were delicious and well-portioned. (I was especially fond of the potato salad and super-fresh coleslaw that came with the panini.)   The menu is extensive, offering both meat and vegetarian/vegan options, and most items can be made vegan and/or gluten-free. There's also a wide selection of juices and coffee beverages. Prices are reasonable, especially as the portions are generous ($20 got us enough food for a nice lunch plus snacks later in the afternoon).  I'm always delighted to find hearty vegan options that go beyond salad - especially when I'm traveling. It's icing on the dairy-free cake when they're served up by friendly people.Thank you, Earth Bistro Cafe!"}
{"text":"Earth Bistro is one of the best kept secrets in Cleveland. Phenomenal, fresh food. Tons of variety, and their menu caters to all: vegans to carnivores.  Service is friendly and the staff remember you.  The dining area is small and cozy.  Definitely don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped here yesterday for lunch. We almost didn't go in because we weren't sure it was open. The blinds were down but the open sign was on so we went in. A sandwich board or flag out front announcing they were open would have been a little more inviting.   I am glad we stopped here to eat though. The food was fantastic. I had a black bean burger and it looked exactly like the picture I had seen on their Facebook wall. It's rare to have food prepared and actually look like the promo picture. The pasta salad was great and I'm not usually one to enjoy pasta salad.   The coffee was good. To me coffee is coffee is coffee. But it did come in some neat mugs. I kinda like nice touches like that. It went really well with the slice of carrot cake I had.   All in all I'm glad we stopped in. This is a nice restaurant to have right around the corner."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!  we ordered the vegan specials, a buffalo chicken sandwich and a pierogi sandwich.  Both came with potato salad and cole slaw on the side.  While it sounds like a weird sandwich, I really liked the pierogis and sauerkraut sandwich.  Would highly recommend this place.  Their portions are huge, so plan accordingly if you want desert."}
{"text":"I am new to the vegan way of eating, just a little over 10+ Weeks into it.  One of the toughest things about it is going out to eat!  This was wonderful!  The food was great and full of flavor!  My coworker had the vegan corned beef special and I had the vegan veggie wrap!  We both enjoyed it huge!  We met the owner and had a long discussion concerning vegetarianism and veganism. I will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"First visit of many more to come!  Dined on Guacamole with plantain chips, Cuban sandwich with home made french fries with slaw and the coconut crepe with house made nutella~all GF and incredibly delicious!!  Service was fantastic...couldn't have felt more welcome :)"}
{"text":"So happy I discovered this place!! I went with a few friends. One vegan one non vegan and they enjoyed it just as much as I did. Their quesadilla is amazing! I am not a vegan but we did get a vegan version and I didn't even notice. They make their own vegan cheese! Impressed! The owners were very accommodating and even made us a special sandwich decked out with capocollo and prosciutto! Very reasonable prices for organic and the amount of food you get! Definitely the to go to stop now! You gotta try their cake!"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic ambiance provided by a cozy dining area and a nice fake fireplace. The food came really quickly, and was absolutely delicious! The menu was extensive enough that everybody should be able to find something, and it's reasonably priced. To top things off, the music selection was AWESOME! Neutral Milk Hotel, Vampire Weekend, and Of Montreal all played while I was there. Love it!"}
{"text":"Their vegan cuisine is amazing! My co-worker mentioned this place to me because I live in the area. I have been here twice so far and I will be back. I have tried the black bean burger and the tofu burger. The flavors, quality and the presentation of their food makes me want to eat at Earth Bistro everyday. The people that work their are friendly too. The interior of the restaurant is very small, yet cozy. Thank you Earth Bistro for providing healthy options to my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  fantastic variety of very high quality dishes! A new favorite place.  :)"}
{"text":"Great healthy food. I loved the selection and everything was great. The people were the best.  I recommend you stop by.  We loved it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I love this place!  The owner is super nice and funny- really fun to talk with. We've gotten the black bean burger (homemade) and the toastada and they are both phenomenal! I highly recommend this place-fresh, delicious healthy meals. Couldn't ask for more. Will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"AMAZING. went for dinner last night, and pretty much had this quaint cafe to ourselves for most of our visit. our server was pleasant and accomodating and had several recommendations for us, as it was our first time visiting. i started with a bowl of the black bean soup (so good!), and i took him up on one of his suggestions and ordered the spicy chicken sandwich (vegan) for my meal. it was delicious. my fiancee ordered the fried tofu sandwich and he was supremely satisfied (and he's quite particular with his food). we were tempted to order the raw cheesecake with berries because it looked so good, but we were full from dinner. we will definitely be coming back to try more of the menu when we are on the west side!"}
{"text":"Took a road trip from Rhode Island to Cleveland and the meal I ate here was much needed. Eating convenient store junk food and sippin' Starbucks coffee at each rest stop left me feeling gross and sluggish.   The Long Branch juice fixed all of that in an instant. It was refreshing and tasted like the ingredients came from a well loved garden. I loved the cabbage salad ( I think it was labeled slaw, but slaw makes me think of a mess of mayo) it came with. I also had the opportunity to try a new veggie, a rarity for an adventurous vegetarian, cuctus!  The outside is nothing special, but the inside is intimate and beautiful. The food will leave your body feeling like a temple."}
{"text":"Loved it! Food was amazing and decently priced! I had the best butternut squash soup with a touch of maple in it - to die for. Then had the famous guac - so so good! Humus chicken wrap to finish the meal (or almost finish, because I was so full at this point). Food was so fresh and cooked to perfection. I was surprised by the choices on the menu, so many options - will have to make multiple trips to try everything!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today! This was the best food I've ate since recently going vegan. I had the Caribbean Veggie Tostadas and they were AMAZING! Definitely plan to eat here again with my husband! Great gluten free and vegan options."}
{"text":"OMG! My meal was amazing at the bistro.  I'm still excited from the experience.  I had the marinated tofu wrap for lunch with the vegan potato salad and coleslaw.  All of it was delicious.  Please give the bistro a try. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"I have been to Earth Bistro a few times now and I am never disappointed. Very fresh healthier fare and the staff is always so nice and welcoming. I'll be an ongoing frequent visitor for sure!"}
{"text":"it's adorable on the inside. as far as food: huge portions and very good. the three other people i was with were all very impressed as well. get the coffee smoothie."}
{"text":"Went here tonight (2/27/16), actually just got back home, and had to post my first yelp review. This place is so good!! I went here with my husband - I'm vegan, he's an omnivore. So awesome to find a restaurant that caters to both of our needs and has some kickass food! Husband had a chicken caesar salad and I had the vegetable fajitas - both of us loved our meals! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place needs more customers! I came here because of the ratings, and left wanting to leave another one. The food here is sooo good, you wouldn't guess that it's actually pretty healthy. I split the carribean style guac + plantain chips/pita bread with a friend and had the Brookes' sandwich with vegan chicken added, and this vegan chicken isn't just the normal soy-based stuff you find in your grocery store freezer; its taste and texture will please carnivores and vegetarians/vegans alike! My friend and I also had juices that were equally amazing. At the end of the meal, I was satisfied and actually had to get a box since the portions are sizable. Located on Clifton, it's easy to miss, but parking is easy to find on the side streets. Please check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place... I can't say enough great things. It's so refreshing to be able to get healthy eats that are well flavored and well priced. The black bean burger is my jam, as is the Cuban sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, but my husband is.  We ate here during a day trip to Cleveland from Columbus.  This place was FANTASTIC!  They had a ton of options for both of us.  The owner's recommendation was perfect.  The service was excellent...very personable.  We will definitely be eating here during our next trip to."}
{"text":"Wow. The food. Amazing. Everything can be made vegan. And it's homemade vegan. The guacamole is full of garlic and smooth as butter. It was so special we asked for some to go. No problem! Our sever was super helpful and really accomdating.  Raw cashew raspberry cheesecake to go? Thank you good sir."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Simply amazing food quality, great service, quaint atmosphere...  I love this place and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"STUPENDOUS! My family was beyond impressed with the service and food. I ate the impossible burger it was superbly seasoned with just the right seasoning and sauce. My daughter enjoyed the beyond burger with vegan bacon. Our other friend devoured the spicy \"chicken\" sandwich. We will be patronizing this establishment again and again. We live in Buffalo and let me tell you the drive will be worth it! Great service and unbelievable food!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!  The owner was very friendly!!!  My husband and I came all the way from the east side just to go there.  Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"It just occurred to me that I have never reviewed Earth Bistro Cafe, and that truly is inexcusable! While I strongly believe that anyone could find something they like on this menu, this restaurant is a major must for all vegetarians and vegan.  The first thing to note is that anything on the menu can be adjusted to be veggie friendly, which is fantastic! I opted for a Cuban sandwich, which was incredible. I could seriously eat one of those every day, and be a happy camper. The pasta and coleslaw sides were also great. I snuck a bite of my boyfriend's vegan buffalo chicken sandwich, which was another winner. The vegan meats and cheeses are unbelievable, and actually caused me to double check that they were, in fact, plant-based.  Earth Bistro deserves all the love, so be sure to give it a try!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. The vegan buffalo wings and the vegan pierogis are my go to. I would seriously order from here everyday if I could.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review is because they changed the way they make the wings and I was told they were taking the pierogis off the menu. I also love that everything on their menu can either be made vegan or kept normal. There's something for everyone."}
{"text":"First time trying this vegan/ vegetarian restaurant and I can say we  absolutely loved it. We ordered 5 different  vegan meals  to share and everything we ate was fabulous. Even was able to bring some home for later!  Can't wait to come back. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great food and the people were very nice!!!  Music and atmosphere were upbeat as well."}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch with a friend. Easily accessed from downtown Cleveland and it is right on the main drag in a little space that was quite comfortable. The menu was varied with lots of vegan options for a $1 up charge. Two of us had veggie panini sandwiches and the other had a vegan chicken pesto sandwich, both of which came with coleslaw and French fries. All of the items were delicious with lots of seasoning and great flavor. We also had the hummus with pita and crudités that was tasty. We finished off with a raw strawberry cheesecake that was to die for, a large portion and quite wholesome. We will definitely visit again the next time we are in town. If you are looking for good vegan/vegetarian food in Cleveland, you should visit this place. The chef is a very pleasant man as well....friendly with great service."}
{"text":"I'm unsure why yelp removes my reviews but it's not appreciated. We have a new local restaurant that is vegan friendly and I want the world to know about it. Earth Bistro in Cleveland is awesome. Just had our third meal there and it was great. Fresh food, friendly staff and great atmosphere. Really love the vegan tacos and Burrito. Love the guacamole . Thank you Earth Bistro ."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I'm calling it a hidden gem because even though I've visited Cleveland more than 5 times in the last four years, I still hadn't visited this place until earlier tonight. Everything on the menu can be made vegan and oh man - everything we had was delicious. I went here for dinner with my husband and his parents. Our favorite dishes were the impossible burger, chicken pesto sandwich, and spicy chicken sandwich (all vegan-ized!). For dessert, we had the strawberry cheesecake, which was great. My father-in-law raved about it afterward. It was a very successful outing. The vegan fare was thoroughly enjoyed by all of us (two vegans and two omnivores). Highly recommend this place! We'll definitely be back when we visit Cleveland again."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday afternoon, little after 2, had the whole place ourselves. I love the decor, very soothing, a lot more seating than you would think from looking at the outside of the building.  Our waitress Hannah, was super sweet and friendly. We started off with the Cuban guacamole, delicious! I normally am not a big plantain chip fan, but theirs were fantastic....the guac had a smoother texture, topped with pineapple and tomatoes, so good the boyfriend actually licked the bowl!  We were not prepared for the size of our entrees...3 tostadas LOADED with all kinds of fresh veggies and black bean puree and a burrito the circumference of an arm.  I've had many vegetable loaded Latin American inspired dishes, my tostadas have taken the prize for vegetables and flavors...so fresh and varied, I could only eat one. The boyfriend loved his burrito, another item stuffed with freshness.  We both took home more than half our meals and agreed next time, we will probably share an entree because their servings are so generous. We will definitely be stopping here again."}
{"text":"Phenomal vegan and vegetarian options. Fantastic food. The dining space is quaint and homey. Couldn't ask for anything more. Check this place out"}
{"text":"Fun little find, I stumbled upon it while looking for a juice bar. I got the juice I was looking for (fresh squeezed carrot, apple, ginger) and also stayed for lunch. The owner was friendly and asked if I am veg/vegan (I'm not). He said that they have veg/vegan offerings but aren't limited to that, which was good for me. I ordered the marinated chicken and hummus wrap. It was delicious!  Nice fresh ingredients and came with pasta salad and a fresh slaw on the side. I'll likely return next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Earth Bistro Cafe is awesome.   I'm generally skeptical about (non-ethnic) vegetarian-oriented restaurants, but Earth Bistro Cafe is a cut above most of the restaurants in the Clifton area.    My wife and I went for lunch - nice ambiance, good music, one server, but he was cool and friendly.   We started off ordering the Caribbean Guacamole served with naan and plantain chips. The guacamole was definitely homemade and really good. A bit different with pineapple in it, but in a good way. The naan and plantain chips came hot and fresh. A good start.  For our main dishes, my wife ordered the fried tofu sandwich, I ordered the black bean burger.  Both came on fresh grilled buns. Both were served with (incredible) pasta salad and coleslaw. You can substitute the pasta salad for fries or potato salad I believe.  Everything we ate was super fresh. The black bean burger was homemade and flavorful. It had a great spicy mayo on it, fresh vegetables. I wish I ordered the fried tofu sandwich like my wife though. It was delicious. Be sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"I love the food here and the fact that there's so many healthy options. My only two complaints that I have is that they state they're open at 11:30 but they never are there to answer the phone when you call in an order around 1130 and the prices for lunch can be a little expensive. I have had the vegan burrito, their chicken hummus wrap, their smoothies and the vegan buffalo wrap, which all were fantastic! The owner is friendly too."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I think this place has some of the best food in Cleveland. I'm vegan and this is absolutely one of the best vegan spots in the city. However, I'm in the service industry, and I am livid. I brought my parents in here, and they loved it. They're incredibly critical about food, and they were blown away by how good everything was. So, my mom brought a friend in for lunch. And they had a terrible experience because of this man. I don't know if he's the owner, or who the hell this man is, but he's a 40-something year old dark-haired man and, thanks to this being yelp, I can't say the things I truly want to say. So, I'll put it plainly. He sucks. He's rude. He's a prick. When I walked in the last time I went, no one said anything to me, so I said, \"hi, how's it going!\" He was sitting down, stared at me, said nothing, got up, and walked to the back. When my mom and her friend went in for lunch, he was their server, and was rude as all hell the entire time he served them. Acting like they were a huge hassle, being sarcastic and rude. I could get more specific, but I won't. Your stupid little restaurant is so difficult to get to, it's always closed for stupid reasons, and yet people STILL make a GIANT effort just to park and get to this place, and we rave about how good it is to friends and family, and THAT is how you're going to treat your customers? F*CK that. I don't even want to go back here now. I'm appalled. I'm a bartender and I deal with some of the best and some of the worst people in Lakewood every god damn night until late into the morning and I STILL treat ALL those people with respect because that is my JOB to do so. How dare you be so rude to people that are putting money in your pocket. If you're so miserable, maybe you shouldn't be in the service industry. If you're going to be that crappy, maybe you should keep your sorry self in the back of the restaurant. If this man is the owner, he should be incredibly ashamed. Learn how to respect the people that are supporting your business, you ignorant excuse of a man. I don't give a damn what your problem is, you need to leave it at the door of your business when you come in to work."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best vegan/vegetarian restaurants in the Cleveland West/Lakewood area! After being Lakewood residents for several years, I decided to visit Earth Bistro Cafe with a friend, and we were both very pleasantly surprised. The service, food and value were all excellent. We had Guacamole as the appetizer (with Pineapples and peppers () served with small nan's and banana chips and it was fresh and delicious. We then shared a Cuban spiced Vege Tostada (3 pieces were served). The veges were fresh and the taste was crisp and excellent. The serving size was large and the 2 of us could not finish the dish! The owner is a very friendly person and was very good at explaining the food choices and left us to explore the menu and pick. We will surely return for more! It is wonderful to see owner owned and operated restaurants succeed in our town. Good job Luis!"}
{"text":"This place is like taking a mini-vacation with a laid back pace and atmosphere.  Warm natural-materials decor is a relief compared to the trend of cold metal retro-modern hipness.  Perfectly seasoned and textured, FRESH & HEALTHY dishes!  I'm still craving the very finely grated slaw that was \"just\" a side to the grilled veggie panini, not even mentioned in the menu description!  Carribean Tostados were refreshing and filling on a hot day after wandering at Edgewater.  Generous portions.  And engaging conversation about current issues with the owner.  Thanks for creating this little oasis, Luis!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and friendly. Warm, welcoming environment. I felt like I had left a friend's dinner party afterward. Extremely refreshing! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best food in Cleveland, vegan or otherwise. I have questioned whether they actually brought me real chicken because the vegan version of everything is so amazing. And the desserts are delicious, especially the chocolate peanut butter cake!"}
{"text":"This is a quaint little spot for vegetarian and vegan dining!  My food was incredible (I ordered a quesadilla) and their homemade potato salad and coleslaw was so good I was tempted to lick my plate clean. I'm a vegetarian, but the friend I went with ordered a Cuban sandwich that had pork on it - he thought it was delicious.   I forget which juice I ordered, but it was SO good I almost treated it like my dessert!  The food at Earthbound is 5 stars but the wait staff was a 1. Maybe I came at a bad time and got unlucky with a bad waitress - but I would definitely come back. Maybe I'll try their take-out next time because the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Believe the reviews! The food was crazy delicious, pricing was fair, serving  size was the largest I have ever had in a Vegan/Vegetarian eatery and the service was great!  We went out of the way to dine here after flying into Cleveland. We were not expecting much and frankly almost changed our minds due to the drive and a few run down looking place on our way there. So very glad we did go, definitely worth the trip"}
{"text":"After going through their fairly extensive menu, I placed my order. Sadly the server came back saying they had run out of it so I had to pick something else. While tasty, the food was generally heavier/greasier than I like. What really bugged me was that the description of the panini I ended up ordering clearly states it was chicken breast, and what came out was most definitely dark thigh meat. It is a good option for vegetarians and vegans though. It is a cute place near the park. Service could use a bit of improvement. The server was more friendly to some people than to others.  Plus my date's dish came out significantly later than mine even though he ordered first since I had to place a new order.  I would give it one more shot and try something different (perhaps the dish I wanted will be available next time!)"}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to the Lakewood area, I have passed Earth Bistro Café about a million times. Each time I thought to myself \"I should probably check this place out.\" Well, almost fourth months later: I finally stopped in.   This place is super unsuspecting. You would barely notice it walking by. The only reason I really did was because I once totally ate it outside and the people sitting on the patio got a good laugh (I use the word patio loosely here, because it's really just some chairs and tables on the sidewalk.) Anyways, once you're inside though it feels like a homey, hole-in-the-wall. Definitely a hidden gem.  My friend Jill and I started our meal in shock of just how many vegan options they have. I am so used to going to restaurants that boast a \"vegan\" menu only to find they have only a small handful of vegan entrées. Earth Bistro Café has an entire menu of vegan and gluten-free meals. We were so torn on what to get we ended up going with what other Yelpers had recommended in their reviews. To start, we got their guacamole that came topped with pineapple and tomatoes and a side of pita and plantain chips. It. Was. Incredible (later that night I went to Giant Eagle to buy more guacamole because this stuff was good I found myself needing more. Needless to say the store-bought wasn't nearly as enjoyable.)   Next came the entrees. I ordered the vegan tacos and Jill got the black bean burger. Both of which were absolutely incredible. I don't think I have ever tried vegan food this good. It was fresh, flavorful, filling, and most importantly: local. And to think it was a 5-minute walk from my house this whole time. I'm so mad I didn't start going sooner (though I'm sure my wallet is happy.)  I honestly don't think anything that comes out of their kitchen could not be anything less than delicious. Every time the waiters/waitresses would carry another meal out, every table would stare and simultaneously whisper to their friends \"oh that looks so good!\" I'm not kidding, this happened every single time.  Do yourself a favor and try Earth Bistro Café, vegan or not. The food is absolutely phenomenal."}
{"text":"Once you get past the wait everything is delish! There was only one guy working everything, but the kitchen so I can understand the wait! We ordered pierogis, buffalo chic wrap, 2 Cuban sandwiches, southwest salad, a couple juiced juices and smoothies, everything was really really good! Definitely would go back when we are in town again"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I had the black bean burger. It was really good and topped with avocado and tomato. I will order it again.  I also tried the veggie and hummus wrap. It was amazing. Both dishes come with their own pasta salad side and dry cole slaw/cabbage with dill sprinkles. Again good! I can't wait to try more food here."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Everything was fresh and you can tell is prepared for each order! Portion sizes are huge too. All is delicious and they are so friendly and accommodating of any diet restrictions. We ordered everything prepared vegan and it was amazing. Will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"I was excited to learn about this place since I'm always looking for places with more vegetarian options. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was very fresh. However, the presentation was a little messy and the meal does not stick out in my mind.  I will probably go back again to give it another shot since the menu did have some unique options."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for vegan/vegetarian food; I can't believe what they can do with tofu!Every meal I have had here has been memorable. All the dishes are made with fresh ingredients and attention to detail. The owner is very casual and gives great service. I mostly do take out, but the times I have dined in have been a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Just arrived in Cleveland (two adults, two kiddos) from the airport and took to yelp to find some vegan options in the area. Wasn't sure when we first walked in, but boy were we surprised. One of the owners welcomed us with a smile and made some recommendations...while not exclusively vegan, just about every item on the menu can be made vegan upon request. This sometimes leaves a bit to be desired because most places just take off the creamy sauces and cheeses, but this was not at all the case here! We went with a vegan quesadilla, tostadas and black bean burger...pretty standard vegan food so didn't have super high expectations but they definitely take the standards up a notch! We enjoyed the same amazing home made sauces and cheeses, only vegan style! Basically everything is made from scratch in house. Everything on the plate was bursting with flavor and color and the ingredients were all very obviously fresh. Portions were HUGE and we ended up w leftovers. We even splurged on vegan chocolate peanut butter cake...also homemade, rich, delicious and beautiful as well! I should have taken photos. We are here for a week and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great, cozy spot if you have dietary restrictions. The gentleman that waited on us made it clear up front that any dish could be made vegetarian/vegan. I ordered a vegetarian tostadas lunch entrée that was pretty good, and my girlfriend ordered a fried tofu sandwich that was amazing. Whenever we go back I will likely order that tofu sandwich, it was that good. The iced coffee I ordered was also very good. Definitely not a \"meat and potatoes\" place, but a fun place to try something new. We would be very likely to eat here again, especially for lunch."}
{"text":"Vegan Heaven!!  We stopped in for an early lunch on a Thursday and we were the only ones there.  The owner's first question for us was are you vegan? I loved that!! He told us he could make anything in the menu vegan.  They have so many choices I will have to go back so I can try them all.  I settle on the spicy fried tofu sandwich which was awesome!! I haven't had chicken in years but I still crave the Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich about once a month and this will fill that craving.  This sandwich made me so happy and it probably one of the better things I've had in a while.  The crispy tofu(which wasn't dry at all) and the spicy mayo made my day.    Even if you're not vegan or vegetarian you still need to try this place.  They have something for everyone on their menu!!    New favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time here, a girlfriend and I went in a little unsure and uneasy of what we would find. Turned out to be an absolute gem. Our server was bright, easy going and bubbly. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming. The menu is accommodating for all walks of life. Except maybe the paleos, sorry buds. The food was outstanding. The chef even came out to talk to us and ask how everything tasted. We ordered two of their cleansing juices, both equally tasteful. New favorite spot."}
{"text":"Wow.....pretty much everything on the menu can be made vegan, which I love.  The owner is so nice and great with recommendations.  I ordered Brooke's sandwich (vegan) and it was amazing.  Easily enough for 2 meals.  The sandwich had 4 pierogi & lots of carmelized onions on it and the dill coleslaw and pasta salad were a tasty bonus.  I also got a vegan dessert, oreo cake, that was decadent.  My total was $19, which is not bad at all, considering the amount of food and how well it was prepared.  I will definitely return as this is exactly the type of business I want to support."}
{"text":"I had the Vegan Rancheros. First of all, *I wasn't even hungry* and was a little disappointed that everything looks so good ...and looked like they would be big plates. Since did it been a long time since I had had huervo rancheros, that's what I got.  I figured I'd just take most of it home.  Looking back, I have to laugh at myself for that thought.  Every aspect of my plate was absolutely delicious. I don't mean \"oh yay it was delicious\", I mean *I started taking smaller and smaller bites because I couldn't bear the thought that this meal would eventually end*.  I'm not sure what else I could say -other than if someone rated this place at three stars or less, I would stop listening to anything else that they had to say about food.  Ever.  Also, as a coffee snob, I gotta say that my iced coffee was good.  Damn good."}
{"text":"Cute spot and VEGAN friendly. The whole menu can be made into vegan.  Loved the photos on Yelp and was excited to try this place but once arrived we got a rude attitude from the owner. He seemed distracted. At the end we found out why... he is currently in the middle of moving his location down the street. That is why they are CLOSED ON TUESDAYS now.   1. Veggie burrito ($11, +$1 for vegan): Most popular on Yelp. HUGE portion with a side of salsa and vegan sour cream. Salsa has no taste at all. The burrito itself was alright... great amount of fresh toppings but lacking a bit of spice/flavour. Great if you're hungry and looking for a healthy option.  2. Black bean burger ($11, +$1 for vegan): Another popular option on Yelp. Decent sized burger with 2 sides. Came with fries and a cole slaw. We did not like the fries one bit. Wayyy too oily, salty and over fried. The inside was still a bit hard, had a bite to it. The cole slaw was decent with a basil and olive oil? dressing. The burger had a bit of flavour from the patty itself but a bit dry because of the beans. Wish they had a sauce to it.   Overall, nice ambiance, fresh healthy options, alright prices, but lacked a bit of flavor to me personally."}
{"text":"Quirky healthy restaurant in residential neighborhood. We were able to find street parking close by. Excellent, knowledgeable, helpful waitress.    I recommend the very tasty homemade black bean burger which I ordered without the bun; served with a delightful dill-infused coleslaw, avocado, tomato, lettuce. I had it with a nice medley of fresh fruit.    I also recommend the Cuban style guacamole topped with pineapple bits and tomatoes and served with plantain chips; we skipped the pita it is usually served with.  VERY large portions; low price point for the quality of food and portion size.  The waitress seemed disappointed that we didn't order dessert, but how can they expect patrons to order dessert when their portions are so large and filling? Caveat: the decor is a little scruffy  (the reason I can't give the review 5*)."}
{"text":"Half ass run restaurant! Hours posted day open at 10:00am on Sundays! NOBODY THERE!!  Employee sitting outside says probably 10:30? Who runs a restaurant like that? Last time we tried to eat here we were told an hour wait for a table and at least an hour to get food because they were understaffed! Won't be in business much longer!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and I was not disappointed.  The service and staff was so attentive and friendly. We felt very welcome, and the food was delicious! The menu had so many vegan/vegetarian for me and also my boyfriend who is usually super picky. We started with the Caribbean guacamole and it was so flavorful and perfect with the plantain chips I could have easily ordered another. I also ordered a mango,peach,pineapple, orange juice and it was very tasty. I've had a lot of veggie burgers in my life and I don't mean this lightly when I say their black bean burger was the best I've ever had. We finished our meal off with the Milky Way coffee and a slice of their peanut butter chocolate cake. I've never had any vegan deserts before but this cake was easily the best cake I've ever had vegan or not. This place is awesome with an all around great vibe I highly recommend it and I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food here was so good! I got the vegan Caribbean Veggie Tostadas and they were delightful. The decor is super cute and the cold brew coffee was super strong. Kept me up nice and good for the long drive ahead of me. The staff was also very sweet and helpful."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Owner is so friendly. Tasty food and they can make anything vegan. Owner was very helpful and educational. Super cool vibe too, little secret hole in the wall that will not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place was very cute!  Perfect addition to the Lakewood/ Cleveland area!  I got a smoothie made from fresh fruits, & the tofu burger that came with a side of potato salad & a dill coleslaw.  Very delicious! Will def be back again!"}
{"text":"The guacamole is amazing and the serving size is super generous. I got the Caribbean tostadas and I could only eat one of the three.   The servings are huge and the ingredients fresh! Definitely recommend if you're looking for something other than a deli!"}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with this unassuming and eclectic space and selection, with its small fan-cooled casual vibe. The entire menu reflects the Cuban influence inspired its Chef- proprietor and every item on the menu has a Vegan variant. I chose for this first-name visit the grilled vegetable burrito, which worked nicely with its infusion of quinoa and pineapple along with a nice grilled vegetable medley. The house-made guacamole and salsa offered as sides really popped with unique spirit and flavor. Their smoothies and desserts can be Vegan-ized as well. Perfect, sizeable and healthy meal for a sultry summer weekend."}
{"text":"Everything can be made vegan so a lot of love to that! Big portions and great food. We had some vegan \"wings\" to start, a big salad, and a great tofu sandwich. Great prices too! Thanks!"}
{"text":"You have to check this cafe/restaurant out! Had their vegan wings and tofu wrap, both were amazing! They also have meat dishes for the carnivores in the group!"}
{"text":"I came for breakfast on Sunday. Everything on the menu can be made vegan for couple dollars extra- so you basically have two full menus: a vegan menu and a non-vegan menu.   I ordered the Hungry Jack because I wanted to try everything and love trying to eat as much as possible, and it was all delicious. But eater beware, it's quite a lot of food. My husband got the non-vegan version and also liked his food. Our server was super helpful and friendly.   Seriously I would eat breakfast here all the time if it were in my city or neighborhood! And I feel that's the highest category of praise I can provide. Just sorry I didn't have a chance to try to lunch/dinner menu because it also sounds delicious."}
{"text":"Wow! Great great. The food was so fresh and tasty .my wife enjoyed the  Black bean burger and said the flavor was excellent. The portions are large and tasty . I had a Cuban panini and could barely finish it all. The potato salad had just the right amount of dill, as well as the flavor of the slaw was delicious. We will certainly come again."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place on an evening walk around the neighborhood and LOVED the food and atmosphere.   Not to mention the owner and service In general was very accommodating.  The place is clean and hip, the smoothie was perfect, the selection was excellent - all too notch for a place we didn't even intend to hit up!  We will definitely be back to dine in!"}
{"text":"Very comfortable atmosphere and amazing food!! They accommodate to allergies and vegan needs. Try the cuban panini sandwich."}
{"text":"For a non-vegan/vegetarian person, I was a bit concerned about what this place would end up being. I have to say I was pleasantly pleased with Earth Bistro Cafe.  Walking in from not the most commercial street in the world, I wasn't sure what to expect. The dining room is a reasonably comfortable, medium-sized space with some basic decor, but nothing particularly noteworthy. We were quickly greeted by a friendly server who presented us with menus and described the menu.  We quickly ordered a starter of the potato and onion pierogies and I got the black bean burger that came with a side of pasta and slaw. The pierogies were actually quite delightful with essentially a mashed potato inside and dressed with sauteed onions and a side of vegan sour cream. They were much more flavorful than I expected and the pierogi skin had a good chew to them.   Unfortunately, the rest of the meal was just mediocre. The slaw was not extremely flavorful or exceptionally dressed. The pasta salad was fine, but nothing special... and I hate to say it because I really wanted to find a great black bean burger here, but it wasn't the best black bean burger I've had and left me wanting. I do believe everything was extremely fresh - all the veggies were still crisp and had a good chew to them, but I just felt that the combination wasn't the best.  My three star ratings I generally give to restaurants that I think are good, but just not something I would recommend to a friend visiting out of town. I may come back to Eath Bistro Cafe when I am on a health kick and on my occasional meat-free days and I think their staff is fantastic.   Bottom line, Eath Bistro Cafe is a great place to visit for a place you're going with someone who appreciates vegetarian or vegan food that will leave you happy as well with good service and some reasonable food options. However, it wouldn't be my first choice of restaurant."}
{"text":"Here you can customize any order to your preferences, whether you're vegetarian, vegan or a meat-eater. The portions are very generous, so this is really a perfect spot to take any combination of people.  You can get just about anything vegan, including sour cream. The juices and smoothies are delicious. The sandwiches always come with two sides, which is usually a pasta salad and their flavorful coleslaw. The raw cheesecake is vegan, but you wouldn't know that if I didn't tell you. :)  My favorite foods: Grilled Chicken Fresco Panini (I've had both the Chicken and the Vegetarian option), Veggie Grilled Burrito, Black Bean Veggie Burger, Spicy Fried Chicken Sandwich, Fresh Hummus.   My favorite Juices/Smoothies: Sea Girt, Bay Head, Seaside Smoothie.   My only reservation, if I had to have one, is that is place isn't open on Mondays or Tuesdays. :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, especially for vegans and vegetarians. There are so many options to choose from and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, healthy food for a fair price. The service was friendly and timely."}
{"text":"In town for Memorial Day weekend and found this cafe so thought we would try it. Black bean veggie burger is delicious! My daughters loved their large house salads with sun dried tomato pesto on toasted bread. Also we tried a smoothie which was wonderful! Foods can be made vegan which is impressive. If I lived here I would eat there 5-6 times a week. Try it! Hannah was a fantastic server!  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Usually a regular at liquid planet, but my cousin introduced me this cute little hidden vegan gem in Lakewood. The space was put together nicely, the chief or cook at the time was really prompt, and good at accommodating to our picky needs, and explain the menu in depth for me being a first timer.   Food was wholesome and really good, it's seem a bit much but live up to its pricing.   THE PASTA IS THE BEST PART OF IT ALL."}
{"text":"I hate to be a Debbie Downer, but...my meal wasn't good. At all. I appreciate that this restaurant offers extensive vegan options, but...  I stopped in on a Friday night for an early dinner. I used to frequent Truffles back in the day, and I was surprised to see that this cafe still looks like Truffles used to.   To start, I ordered the tofu wing special. I LOVE me some tofu wings, but these just weren't good. The breading kept falling off, the tofu didn't seem cooked, and the wing sauce just wasn't my cup of tea. I also didn't think the dipping sauce tasted like much.   Then I had the special - a sandwich with an olive tapenade, pickles, sprouts, and avocado. The best part of it was the tapenade. The flavors just didn't work for me. I did also enjoy the pasta salad that came with my sandwich. The slaw? Not so much.   My fiance liked his ham and mushroom sandwich. Still seems a little odd to me that a restaurant would serve 80% vegan food and then some meaty items, but...what do I know?"}
{"text":"I drove by and found this gem and was very impressed. The menu has a lot of variety for a vegan or meat eater. Feels like it should be out West and unique for the area."}
{"text":"Not just vegan food! (Although vegan food is awesome) I was soooo impressed with this place! Honestly this was by far the best Cuban I have ever had and I've had quite a few dozen. Usually there is one measly pickle- but not at earth bistro cafe! I sat there and exclaimed how great this panini was to my poor roommate at least 5 times. The curried pasta salad that came with it was amazing as well. I didn't care for the coleslaw but that was a personal I don't like fennel (I think that's what it was) type of thing. My roommate was obsessed with her vegetable quesadilla so that makes two extremely happy customers.   The service was friendly, helpful, and almost familiar if that makes sense. For how divey this place looks on the outside its absolutely adorable on the inside- although they will be moving out of this location this weekend (October 2016). It looks like the perfect place to sit and drink coffee or tea on a cold winter day with a sweater and fluffy scarf.   Neither my roommate or I are vegetarian/vegan but we both often eat vegan (yay plants!) so this place just jumped really high up on our list. I cannot wait for the new location to open so I can try more and I hope it's as cute and cozy as the current one!"}
{"text":"WOW this place is great !!! Heading back from Detroit to NY I decided to take a detour and spend one more evening in Cleveland. Sooooo glad I did. This place is AMAZING. Started with the cuban styled guacamole and I had the vegan burrito for dinner. The guac has a caribbean kick to it but it's not overpowering, it's a nice touch. Same goes for the burrito, it's a slight twist to the veggie burrito. Enough to get your attention but not so much that you yearn for a classic burrito. These people are creating flavorful vegan food...and hitting it outta the park no less.  The service is first rate. All in all, it was a perfect evening...to think I almost by-passed Cleveland !!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times now I have yet to order a meal that wasn't fantastic. This place is a hidden gem! They cater to vegans and non vegans... they have a ton of options! The portions are also large. If I could give more than 5 stars I would!"}
{"text":"This five star rating is not a gimmie. Earth Bistro is fresh, delicious, and thoughtful.  Upon arrival, I was greeted and sat by a friendly staff member. He informed me that all menu items could be made vegan or gluten-free (nice!). I ordered a Havana juice and took to the menu.  So many options and flavors! My mouth was watering by the time I even glanced at an entree.  I settled on the Veggie burrito supreme after some quick staff input.  My juice arrived! My stars! The excitement was met with a deliciously tangy mix of avocado and  citrus. Modest mouse came on over the speakers and my heart soared. \"Might I be in love?\", I wondered. My burrito arrived and with the first bite I knew, \"yes, this is the place you have been searching for\".  The owner and staff both chatted with me as I finished my meal. I love when a place provides not only terrific food but smiling service.   I want each of you to check out Earth bistro. Lunch or dinner, alone or friends in tow, this place has got it."}
{"text":"I blundered in around lunchtime. I was virulently tired of drive-thru crap and cold sandwiches, so I decided to give this place a shot. The owner met me at the door and welcomed me in conversationally; it wasn't like getting bombarded at a TGI Friday's or something.   I grabbed a table for one (a pleasant, rare thing, really! ) and settled on the veggie tostadas. I expected coffee shop portions, but what I found was a dinner plate with three fist-sized, crispy but not overdone tostadas MOUNDED with fresh veggies. The marinated cactus was a great side, a lot better than I had anticipated.   The inside is quiet, private, clean, and modern. I didn't feel like I was meters away from a main road at all, which was rather rejuvenating at midday. The only thing this place needs is more customers. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is top notch. The service was knowledgeable on the menu. He steered me straight to the Cubano which was delightful with the fresh grilled pineapple and the generous portions of pork and ham. It was accompanied by an oil based dill slaw that hit the spot and a chilled penne salad.   The wifey indulged in their deconstructed caprese salad that filled the plate with greens and giant portions of fresh mozzarella and tomato. The balsamic reduction was on point and done right.   Once this place gets more recognition it will be hopping. Stop in while it's still easily accessible."}
{"text":"This is probably the best vegan restaurant in the Cleveland area and it's suburbs. The whole menu can be make vegan and the ingredients are always fresh,  the food is always flavorful and tasty.  I will recommend everyone to come and try it believe me you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. Huge portions and friendly service. We had coffee which was great and I'm a coffee snob. I only drink black coffee. I also had the buffalo chicken which came with slaw and potato salad, all homemade and fresh. Split fries and a peanut butter cake. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"What a wonderful neighborhood gem! This is a small, intimate mostly vegetarian restaurant. The food is absolutely delicious. I had the vegan tacos and they were out of this world. My husband ate the Cuban ham panini and he really loved it. We also had tapenade and guacamole and I can't say enough good things about how truly tasty every bite was. This is a not to be missed spot for great vegetarian fare."}
{"text":"We braved the wintry madness last night for carry-out and we were very happy with our delicious meal from Earth Bistro Cafe - we are new to the area and I am overjoyed with all of the vegan options within minutes from our home!   My husband had a Cuban Panini that came with pasta salad and coleslaw. I had a the Black Bean Burger, which was easily one of the best veggie burgers I have had - it also came with pasta salad and coleslaw.   Everything tasted really fresh and homemade, and we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Definitely enjoyed our 1st visit, everything was super fresh and tasty! Loved the grilled pineapple in the guacamole. I also was impressed with the amount and variety of veggies in my tostadas. Great service and friendly staff! I will definitely be back soon! Glad to see another healthy restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Delicious little café tucked away on Clifton.  I lived in Lakewood for years and am so bummed I didn't discover it until last week!  I'm a vegetarian and this place has a large selection of vegetarian/vegan options.  I had the veggie tostadas and a fresh juice (that had ginger/carrot/orange--tangy and amazing!)  Everything tasted fresh and very interesting combinations of flavors.  Going back soon!"}
{"text":"We come hear for their fantastic menu all the time and drive from Avon. The restaurant is located at 117th and Detroit which is becoming really hip and cool. You can park on the street or on the nearby side streets, just make sure to check the nearby signage...we were ticketed   Most times, we come for the brunch. The brunch menu is AMAZING, and every single dish can be made vegan. I had the Hungry Jack, as everything looked good, and that meal gives you the opportunity to try everything! And...everything was delicious! The plate is huge, and I was starving upon arrival. Usually, I would be taking half of the meal home with me, but I ate every last drop this time. It came with 2 fluffy perfectly cooked pancakes, 1 French toast with fruit, Tofu Scramble, 2 pieces of toast, a serving of hash browns, and  vegan bacon, ham, and sausage. Everything, I mean everything was amazing. Syrup and jelly were free as well. They also have a good selection of smoothies, coffee, and tea, which could be made with dairy, almond, or soy milk. One of the people I had with me even had a vegan hot chocolate! They also have a juice bar. It is very quaint and cozy, but can get a little too hot. And, they serve everything they make vegan non-vegan so everyone can enjoy their food(even though the vegan is better for you and probably does not taste too much different with how good their food is!)   CHECK THIS PLACE OUT NOW!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Loved the environment. For being a small place it was very welcoming, designed great and had phenomenal food. Can't wait to return and try their other options!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I love that you can make any item on the menu vegan or vegetarian. I got the vegetarian version of the buffalo chicken sandwich and It was super tasty. Also loved the sides. So much better than the usual chips or fries you receive at a restaurant!   Here's a photo halfway through"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely incredible the food was delicious the atmosphere was very quaint and I believe at this restaurant is underrated and should be rewarded for it beautiful food as well as beautiful establishment five stars"}
{"text":"We love this place!!  The food is awesome, service is always super friendly, the food is always awesome!  LOVE the dill slaw and the potato salad!  The specials are always awesome!  The owner/chef is SO creative!  The tacos, tostadas, portobello panini, vegan gyro, piadina, the hummus wrap... I've never left Earth Bistro hungry, everything has always been awesome!  They started making this vegan cheese sauce that is incredible!  It tastes like smoked cheddar!  And you HAVE to try the raw vegan cheesecake... If it's not sold out!"}
{"text":"This place serves amazingly fresh food. It has a tasty Cuban fusion flare. The menu is two sided with one side strictly vegan. I personally love the Portobello Panini with tofu. The decor is cozy and inviting, and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"My family & I recently visited here after hearing the rave reviews of others & after having that well known flu that's been taking people out left & right, I needed real food.   However, I mad a stupid mistake and misunderstood the menu- after ordering the sweet panini ( I thought it included goat cheese & caramel sauce but it's just goat milk caramel) I  found myself disappointed...it needed the cheese! Although had I gotten it with bananas I might have felt differently. I also tried their Manasquan juice & found the carrots over powering but again, I just got over being sick- we all know things can taste funny when you're not well so please don't take my review too seriously.    The place itself is too adorable & our waitress was lovely. The rest of my family loved their food and all of us can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best quality food I've ever had. This is the most unique menu I've ever seen. Even if you aren't a veggietarian or vegan this is one stop you have to put on your bucket list! Noone can top the quality of this food and the brains behind whoever created such a delicious menu."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!   We arrived for lunch and were surprised to find how many gluten free and vegan items were available. We loved the earthy decor and the owner also took our order. He was hilarious and made conversation with us, which made us feel happy to support a local business. The food came out promptly and was VERY fresh and delicious. There were so many vegan options, I wish I could have ordered everything. The servings were huge. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Energetic and passionate staff. At first glance this place may not look like much but don't be fooled! The food is incredible and worth a visit. I would go back all the time if I was local. Very happy to have found this place. Will bookmark for the future."}
{"text":"I stopped in today for lunch, and ordered the grilled Black Forest ham and cheese sandwich on gluten-free bread.  The cole slaw was delish, as was the fruit salad (blackberries in the fruit salad!  Fab!).  The sandwich was scrumptious!  That ham is the BEST!  I also got the Spring Lake Juice.  So good!  If you haven't tried this place yet...DO IT!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! I'm in Cleveland for a LEGO event with my mom, and she is a vegetarian. I picked this place because of all the great reviews. All the great reviews were right. It's a cozy little place with very friendly service. I had the Cuban Panini sandwich, and mom had the marinated tofu wrap. Both of our meals are HUGE and VERY tasty!!!  We both enjoyed the meal very much. Next time I'm in Cleveland, I will have to come back to try the other menu items."}

{"text":"I would recommend this restaurant for sure. Super accommodating staff, good vibration and great food. We had the vegan tacos and veggie burger. The burger was really good!  Don't be a weak little bitch by having some brain washed fool kill animals for you to eat, go vegan!"}
{"text":"I am sad I moved out of the neighborhood. I was waiting for my final walk through of the old apartment and decided on carryout from Earth Bistro to take to my mom's house after. On my first visit here, I had the veggie burrito with cactus slaw and it was delicious. This time around I had the house salad, black bean and quinoa burger and the Cuban. They were all great and tasted fresh. The people working here were very friendly. This is a great place for dine in or carryout that will serve both the vegan and meat eating people of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Had the tostadas and the potato salad and really enjoyed them. I am dying to go back and try the vegan French Onion Soup!"}
{"text":"I came here on a very spontaneous trip and did not know what to expect upon entering. Typically this type of restaurant isn't somewhere I would usually go and I was worried about finding something on the menu I would be excited about trying, but I found that the unique menu was actually amazingly delicious! It's rather quaint and I would definitely recommend this underrated restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a great place for vegetarians and vegans(and meat eaters)! At first I was hesitant, but it was really good. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. It's a great place to go to if you're looking to try something new, delicious, and healthy!"}
