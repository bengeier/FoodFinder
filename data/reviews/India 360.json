{"text":"Unfortunately, this franchise location has gone downhill somewhat. I walked in to have lunch one day, and the lights were turned off! My immediate thought was they were trying to save money. The lunch menu was also gone it was a la Carte all the way.  I had dined here several times in the past, and I was very familiar with the broad range of curries and specialty dishes they offered, but the last time I was there quality had gone down hill.  It was also expensive, around $25-30 per person for lunch, and I was surprized when I ordered the nan that it was dry, very strange.  Raising prices and dropping the lunch menu I think will be their downfall. Too bad.  Jim"}
{"text":"I just been to this restaurant food is so so, but the server was very pushy and forcing to order too many dishes.  On their website it show they have buffett, when we went there no buffett, she recommended starters, we went for lunch.  Starters I told her to bring Somosas and Pakora, we actually ordered one tea and then two other my guest was not interested in Tea, the server forced her to have tea.  Paneer Pakora was most expensive i ever had $16.00 plus tax, tea $ 3.50 each, we told her to bring one rice then she said it is too small, she said you need two plates of rice, we hardly had rice from one plate.  Jeera rice $ 5.50 each.  Butter chicken was very sweet, not worth the money.  Over all disappointing experience.  Again food was so so, but make the girl server not force on guest to place too many orders.  For total 3 people the lunch cost was over $ 100.00 plus tips.  Over all not happy at all.  Lots of food left over, we have to pack doggy bag. That's it I will not go there again."}
{"text":"This place was almost empty on a Friday night. There was only one table occupied by a family who we were told, were waiting for quite a while to be served their order. There was only one waitress-cum-cashier-cum-manager trying her best to do it all. She was very honest in informing us that it would be a long wait for our order. So we thanked her for her honesty and left. I wonder why the owners would spend on keeping such a unique Indian restaurant in such a prime location, yet neglect it to such an extent. They should consider converting it to a purely take-out location instead of stinging on the service and kitchen staff."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this place we ordered only NAAN, we waited while they prepared them so it took about 30 mins. We didnt mind because they were delicious. However, Extremely expensive compared to all other south asian restaurants.  we ordered them again a couple weeks later along with butter chicken, kababs and chicken biryani.  Firstly i want to add, the naan were not fresh and were a little on the raw side. Secondly, the butter chicken was too sweet. Lastly, the kababs cost $13 and we got 2 kababs cut up in 5 pieces. Horrible.  I think all south asians are smart enough to realize how they are ripping off customers and only non south Asians would go there if they do not realize what the norms are.  I think the inconsistency in service and the high prices for mediocre food is the reason me and my husband will not visit again. Too bad, we love indian food and since we live in stouffville its pretty close but id rather drive far to markham then to subject myself to this food."}
{"text":"I visited this place on a Sunday evening for a private event with selected buffet dishes. The staff was very courteous and the place was quite clean, although I didn't visit the washroom. The atmosphere doesn't involve a crazy theme but it looked descent and not overwhelming. It can accommodate a good number of people as long as most of them are sitting down. I'm quite picky and not very adventurous so I stuck with certain dishes. I have a certain tolerance for spice, but the food was within acceptable range. I think it's all a matter of taste for each individual but I found it to be pretty good. The naan was  fresh. I also tried the tandoori chicken and butter chicken with a cold Coke to wash it down. I think that the chicken biryani varies from other places but I liked it. I was full after two plates and most importantly I didn't experience any repercussions. The coffee we had later ordered at my table took a long time to arrive but it tasted good. The bench type seats near the windows with a straight back gave me a bit of a back pain, but I was there for about 3 hours for an event and so I doubt anyone would normally stay there for that long. It was a hot day in July and I also began to feel the heat in the last hour that I was there. All in all I think it's worth a try since I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"To find good Indian food in Scarborough is surprisingly a struggle.  The food here is decent enough. It's good- haven't had a bad experience thus far but it's not amazing or memorable.  The service is good and the restaurant is nicely decorated.  Their Faluda is really good too- so try that for dessert."}
{"text":"I visited India 360 on a weeknight for dinner with my family. The ambiance is nice and they were playing old Bollywood music on a TV in the corner of the restaurant; helped the wait for the food go by faster. The restaurant is quite small as well.   We ordered two curries: Saag Malai and Aloo Shimlamirch with naans and rotis on the side. We also ordered some basmati rice and rasmalai to finish. Tasty food, typical Indian is how I would describe it. Food arrived in about 15-20 minutes and the service was very pleasant. The waitress was attentive and made sure we were doing ok. Prices are decent and with dessert and tip the total came to around $15/person.  Overall 4/5 stars, nothing spectacular but it was good for a nice weeknight dinner."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for unauthentic oily slop. Butter chicken had TWO pieces of chicken, then a couple of bits. It was oily, weirdly sweet, and wreaked havoc on our stomachs. How do you let something like that come out of your restaurant?! This place is terrible, save your money."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been so many times for their lunch buffet and can't get enough. The place is very clean and a nice atmosphere compared to most indian restaurants I've been to. They have tons of variety and will be conscious of religious holidays to cater their buffet to those needs. The only indian dessert they have that I like is the gulab jamun. That's the one thing they're lacking on as every time I come they don't have other options. But I do love gulab jamun so it's not really a loss for me. The naan they bring out is good but I've had a situation where it was overcooked. It's never busy when I come at lunch but it should be. The quality of food is great and the service is wonderful. Definitely will be coming back someone soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food served here.  I'm by no means an Indian food critic (this is the first Indian food restaurant I've been to), so choosing what I want was always an adventure.  But whatever I chose was always really tasty.  They will also adjust the spice lever upon request, which is nice.  The food is a bit pricey, so I generally save some money by taking out and making my own rice/sides.  Also, the restaurant is usually uncomfortably empty, so it feels weird to me to eat there.  If you're looking to try Indian takeout, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Full disclaimer, only went once. But I'm a fan overall.  I ordered the shahi paneer, mixed vegetable korma, and the dahi vada appetizer for takeout. It was quite delicious.  Misc: I'm not a fan that they don't accept American Express.    Taste: One thing is that was observed was that the tomato flavor was a little overwhelming in the korma, as well as the what was believed to be the scent of cinnamon.  The dahi vada was spectacular in taste and had fresh tasting yogurt and vada... Which for whatever reason is hard to find at Indian restaurants for this dish.  Service: Since I did takeout, can't comment too much. But they were prompt with the order and decently polite.  Overall, wouldn't mind going again to try a sit down experience."}
{"text":"We used to go here often; however, haven't been back in a while because we found bead jewelry in our food. Completely disgusted ... will never go back."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I have that irresistible craving for Indian food. On my most recent visit I had the lamb rogan josh, butter chicken, coconut shrimp masala, chicken biriyani, garlic naan, and raita (yogurt sauce). The food was delicious and was served piping hot. The curry sauces/gravy on these dishes were so rich and flavourful. My only critique would be that I would have preferred the lamb to be cooked more tender. The shrimp dish was amazing as well, with big juicy pieces of shrimp and a mouth watering tangy curry sauce. (..not sure if it was tamarind or perhaps lemon) The biriyani was moist and flavourful, and the butter chicken was smooth and velvety with chunks of white meat tandoori chicken. Garlic Naan is a must, to sap up those savoury curry sauces. The service has always been courteous, fast, and exceptional. I visited around the lunch hour on a very cold and chilly sunday. It was a tad bit chilly inside but the food quickly warmed me up :) We also had the raptors game on the television, which was a bonus. A warm masala chai afterwards, and I was good to go! I would recommend that you skip the buffet (not sure if they even have this option anymore), because it's just not the same. The level of freshness when you order a la carte is just not comparable. Great job India360. My compliments to the chef for a delicious and filling meal."}
{"text":"Used to go for lunch (food is fantastic) but recently had to find somewhere else to go. Most people in my company take lunch from 12:00 - 1:00 pm. They turn their ovens/stove on at noon, so there's no chance to get your food (with naan bread) before 12:40-12:45, and that's when we need to actually be starting to head back to work.  Great restaurant, but do yourself a favour and don't go there for lunch."}
{"text":"Had a fairly positive experience when we came here on Sunday night with a few friends. The place was somewhat busy and we were seated as we walked in.   They have a good menu with plenty of things to choose from. We ordered the paneer tikka Masala (cottage cheese cubes), malai kofta (potato and cottage cheese dumpling in tomato cream sauce), butter chicken, with saffron rice and garlic naans.   The food was delicious, the naan were crisp and so buttery. There was plenty of garlic and the naan was super savory. The rice was fragrant and creamy (with a good amount of saffron) and both paired absolutely perfectly with the curry. The curries were great, they were smooth, creamy, and sweet. The food were nice and warm which is a plus. Everything we ordered tasted very similar (tomato sauce based) but that is our fault. I also felt that there could have been more pieces of chicken/kofta/paneer in the bowls of curry. There was only 3/4? Malai kofta dumplings, one of my friends didn't even try it.   The prices are also on the high side. $14 for a bowl of curry is a bit too much. Add a bowl of rice ($6) and some naan ($3), and you've got some expensive Indian food, so don't come here expecting good value. But to be fair, there's plenty of curry in the bowls. I thought they would have had buffet for dinner passing by their lunch buffet signs for years but I guess that's only for lunch. Service could have been a bit better. Water took a while to arrive.  That being said, I would definitely return here again."}
{"text":"Very good food, I'm not Indian but seems authentic.  To give you the true experience of India they do not have air conditioning (or at least not turned on).  30 degree celsius temperatures, 80% humidity and Indian food do not make for a comfortable dining experience.  Service was also very slow.  I had somosas and curried lamb.  If it wasn't for the delicious food they would have gotten 1 star."}
{"text":"Nice & clean place.  The food was on the mild side (not really spicy).  Variety was ok (from veg to meats).  I think service was definately where I would rate this place a 4*."}
{"text":"We had food on a Saturday evening. It was not crowed. Food is okay. The non veg platter is nice. The staff is courteous. It's open late till 11 pm so it works. I have had better chicken biryani elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service was fine. Tables and men's washroom were not clean. Hair in one plate of food. Food was good."}
{"text":"We had our first chance to visit the new India 360 in Stouffville on Sunday. We popped in on the spur of the moment to quickly pick something to take home....and we were pleasantly surprised by the friendly, fast service. We have our favourite Indian restaurants in Toronto, but are delighted to find this little gem closer to home! We ordered the butter chicken and chicken biryani. Both items were perfectly prepared with just the right amount of heat. The flavour was delicious. We look forward to returning  soon."}
{"text":"Staff was rude here both times I called.  No more buffet by the way."}
{"text":"The service was good here :)  Personally i enjoyed it. I am  a vegetarian & I found fairly excellent.   Birch, a close friend of mine went there and he found there was a lack of fish cuisine which he enjoys thoroughly.  Definitely a nice place to go once in a while. Place was also clean & your full by the en"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was bad. Their menu says \"free naan or rice with purchase of entree\" and when we went to pay they said that \"only for the Scarborough location\".  That is the menu that they give out in Stouffville.  They would not honour it and only offered 10% off which wasn't even equivalent to the savings.  They would do much better with a lunch buffet as well. I know it's a small space but they don't need much room.  The Bombay Grill on Highway 7 is able to with a small space so they should as well. I think their business would do much better if they did."}
{"text":"The food here is \"ok\" - i've had alot worst, i've also had alot better. My concern with this place is the price. $6.50 + tax for 2 normal sized garlic naans is ridiculous, especially for Markham/Scarborough. They are trying to go for that upscale indian dining, the price is certainly upscale but the food and atmosphere is mediocre. On a few occasions i've ordered for pickup, they say its ready in 20 mins, i would arrive after 30 mins and still have to wait 15-20 mins for my food to be ready. On one occasion it was ready right when I walked in.  The butter chicken is pretty good, and not too oily (unlike some other places). I will most likely be back but i'd eat here more often if the price was more reasonable."}
{"text":"India 360 has taken a 360, again, pun unintended, on traditional Indian eateries; Very little cream, oil, butter, \"masala\", fairly healthy yet uncompromised in taste. The restaurant's cozy bistro-like atmosphere was...Just that, cozy. Service was very good. The buffet bar was quite tasty and standard: A little more variety needed in the desert and salad department. Dinner here left us with a GREAT post-dinner buffet feeling; Light and healthy."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. I love the food here. I ordered Fish Amritsari and it was amazing, loaded with spices and was super tasty. The paste was smooth and creamy. Order salmon if you don't like fish bones. I also ordered Garlic naan and it was crispy, with plenty of garlic. The size was decent to me since I couldn't finish my order.   The restaurant itself is clean and cozy. The price is decent for such an upscale Indian dining. A lot to choose from the menu.   However, the service was way too slow. It took them a long time to seat us even though we called ahead for reservation. Food did take long time to arrive, approximately 45 minutes. The staffs looked tired, inattentive, and unfriendly. Hence the 3 stars...  But to be fair, we came on Diwali and that could also be the reason why they were slow in basically almost everything. It wasn't very busy when we came but probably was busy before. The staffs must be tired running around since the restaurant was understaffed during Diwali. We were quite a big party as well.   I will definitely come back here and give it another chance on the service aspect. Overall, food was good, service wasn't."}
{"text":"Well, that didn't last did it. Now taken over by a family member with zero experience in the industry so now lengthy wait times and bad service, foods even worse."}
{"text":"India 360 is by far one of the best hidden treasures in Town. I have been there three times now. I spoke to the chef and he was delightful.   I ordered butter chicken each time and Naan.(yes I know not very adventurous) I have also tried the samosas. I must say the curry is wonderful. You can taste the various spices and you just know it is made with the best of ingredients. I would recommend the butter chicken(obviously I have had it three times now..) :)   The restaurant is very clean. Décor is traditional.   I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"The food is always good here. Who ever the chef is.. he sure knows how to cook Indian food with Lots of flavor. Usually I don't like chain restaurants, but they aren't bad at all. Try the vegetable pakora and cucumber salad as an app. Tikka chicken Masala and the lamb briyani. Yum! Oh and of course butter chicken. Customer service is good too!"}
{"text":"Their food is not good and dor Buffet, they don't have much different varieties of food items. Just waste"}
{"text":"Where can I give this place no stars?  The only interesting thing about the restaurant was the iPads on the table.  First, I am a person who loves authentic food. I have eaten many of the items on the menu and knew what I was ordering. Unfortunately the kitchen staff didn't know how to properly cook my order. And I ordered off their menu!  We waited almost 30 minutes for the entrees to arrive. When I wife asked for milk for her tea she was stared at with disbelief that anyone would want such a thing. They then brought her a cup of milk to pour into her tea. That should have been the warning, but we ignored it  Vindaloo on the menu was rated as being hot. I have had Vindaloo before and knew what I was ordering. I especially instructed our waitress, who looked like she didn't understand the food or want to be there, that I wanted the food authentic and I knew it would be served hotter than most North Americans would expect. What I go was a bland platter of sauce covered food.  Not impressed and wanting exactly what I ordered I tried to find our server, who had disappeared into the kitchen with all the other staff members. There was yelling in there and after five minutes I was able to get the attention of another waitress and explained the displeasure with the food. To her credit, she removed the dish and I wanted another 10 minutes before it appeared out of the kitchen. Again, it was not near the heat level that the dish is supposed to have.  When I asked the waitress for some hot peppers in order to \"Spice the dish up\" she went to the kitchen and returned with six whole chilli's on a plate. It was like the kitchen staff gave us the finger, saying if you want hot, eat these. Little did they know that I actually eat those exact peppers as a side dish all the time. But, any good restaurant would cut them up into easily sprinkled parts so you would not have to bite into the chilli themselves. Well, my wife had one and it took the other five to bring the Vindalu heat level close to what is should have been.  As a note, the lamb int he Vindalu was tough, and hard to chew. This is indicative of a meat overcooked at hight heat. I only tried a few other things and found them bland for the culture. Should have gone to the Tia place next door.  After finishing our food we asked for the bill. It came after 15 minutes. We place our credit card into the folder and after 30 minutes started to use the \"Call Staff\" alert on the iPad. We finally got out of the place after just over 2 hours.  The staff meeting in the kitchen was not a good experience.  Durring our mean it sounded like there was still construction going on in the back. Why would you do that durring your opening hours? Why would you open if your not complete the construction?  All in all it was a very negative experience. If you're looking for authentic Indian food you're not going to get it here. Best to take a trip to The Host in Markham for a buffet lunch for 1/4 of the price of this place and get food cooked correctly.  We will not be returning to this restaurant."}
