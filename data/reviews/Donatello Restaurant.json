{"text":"We had a great dinner again at Donatellos. We have been coming here for years, actually followed them down the street when they moved. The service here is friendly, attentive, and the servers know you are there to enjoy an evening. We like to have our appetizer while we stroll through the menu. I tried the grilled peppers appetizer, it was not what I had expected, the server took it away, replaced it with something else, and it was removed from the bill. My entrée was the veal Marsala, an amazing dish. The veal is so tender, and the Marsala sauce incredible. This seems to be a family run restaurant, very welcoming, and caring staff. I can comfortably recommend it to my friends"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant, a short walk from our hotel. Even without reservations, we were seated promptly (though the restaurant filled a short while later) Our waitress, Mila, was phenomenal- she was prompt, attentive, friendly, and answered all our questions about the evening's specials. Everything we ordered was delicious, and the servings were satisfying! We shared a calimari appetizer, and these were among the best we've had anywhere. Homemade ravioli was outstanding- it made me wish I lived in Toronto so I could return regularly!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant. The waiter didn't write down any of our orders; he listened and then went around the table verifying what we wanted. This happened for dinner and then for dessert, and he made mistakes both times. We fixed them on verification, but still, get a pad, dude.   I had a special salad with basil, bocconcini, and tomato. It was excellent. My dinner was another special, ravioli stuffed with mushroom and ricotta in a pesto sauce. It was pretty bland and I didn't enjoy it very much.   The waiter asked how everything was. I said it was just okay, but then he never followed up to make sure I was happy. In fact, when he cleared the table he asked someone else how it was, but not me. It gave me the impression that they were not interested in getting me something I wanted or making it up to me in any way. Perhaps they thought I liked it because I finished it.   For dessert I had the mikly way cake, which was fine. It was a very large piece."}
{"text":"This was an OK meal for a high cost $250 for family of 4.  The food all ranged from OK to good, but nothing was really worth writing home about - apart from the bread and butter which was yummy.  Powdered cheese instead of freshly grated was disappointing.  The service was good, the wine list impressive.  Tiramisu was small and too weak in flavour, a sad end to the meal."}
{"text":"Very nice calamari. And excellent pasta. Will be back!"}
{"text":"If you like Italian food, this is a great choice!  Everything was very authentic and beautifully presented.  The specials all sounded really good, but I went with the \"Gnocchi Donatello,\" which is potato dumplings in a cream tomato sauce with pine nuts and fresh basil.  It was really, really tasty!  My beer was quite pricy - $6.75 for a Birra Moretti, but in line with the scale of the restaurant.  We did not know that reservations were necessary or encouraged, so we just showed up for dinner.   They took us upstairs to a hallway to wait, then moved us to an upstairs bar, then finally to a table in the main dining room.  All in all, maybe a 15-minute wait.  It was worth it, and we were treated well."}
{"text":"Wow amazing! Eggplant appetizer was fantastic and who would have thought citrus (orange zest?) cream sauce compliments butternut squash ravioli. Service is unbelievably fantastic as I love my water, which the glass never went below half glass. Red house wine is amazing for the price and the atmosphere does not rush you to escape regardless if you are by yourself (i.e. me) or with a group of six."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had the best experience here, the service was excellent, the place was beautiful. Great Italian food. We ordered the Caesar salad and shared it, I ordered the chicken with prosciutto and mozzarella and side of pasta which was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the steak which he said was good but also wasn't the best steak he had which is the only reason we're not giving it five stars. We also shared the royal truffle cake for dessert which was amazing, the best cake I've ever had. If you're downtown Toronto we definitely would recommend Donatello's to you."}
{"text":"Had the cheese tortellini and bruschetta. Very good taste and plenty served. On the slightly expensive side but worth it. Friends had the gnocchi which was also awesome. Very good option for Italian food. We were a group of 10 and they were very accommodating. Good service."}
{"text":"As my wife, toki says, it was really really tasty. . . yeap.  me too.  I ordered the veal marsala with a red sauce pasta.  I would ask for some spanghetti instead of the penne.  However, very delicious and the service is on par with what you'd expect from a good restaurant.  toki also says, even the bread was delicious."}
{"text":"My friend and I chose this restaurant based on the previous Yelp reviews. Downstairs was busy and we were seated upstairs. Halfway thru appetizers, the staff set a table for 6 next to us. Then they added a table and another and another until we were surrounded by 20 strangers. We asked to be moved and were put off in a corner. And that was pretty much the last we saw of the wait staff. My friend flagged down a waiter and requested coffee 4 times. It never arrived. My request for a refill was also overlooked. After we had finished, we had to go and hunt down a server to pay our bill. Their reaction: sorry and we'll give you a discount. Score: Food +2, Service -11. First time in 20 years that I didn't leave a tip to reward good service. Didn't feel bad about it either."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews on a public feed, as I have my own blog, but an experience at an restaurant I dined at this evening made me feel like I needed to join this community. I'll have to write a lot of reviews since I literally take a picture of everything I eat (it's an addiction! :0).  I don't normally go to restaurants that require a dressy attire or proper dining etiquette (with the out to in fork and spoon rule and all), but when my friend who rarely bothered to leave her house asked me if I wanted to go out to eat Italian food, I was so down.   After some research, either on blog-to or dine-to, we were choosing between this place and Kitkat Bar & Grill. But we decided on Donatello as it was apparently up a notch from Kitkat's home-styled food, and within the accepted distance and price range of the average student thriving on minimum wage-based jobs. Plus it had good reviews according to Yelp, Tripadvisor, and one anonymous food blogger.  -REVIEW-   We only noticed the dressy casual attire until an hour before our appointed time of arrival at 5:30pm, and having just ended work, none of us were dressed properly.  Dim lighting, fancy setting, tablecloth, candles, and wine glasses. Everything was clean.Women wore dresses and men wore upscale dress shirts, and the host was very polite and kind.   Another friend and I sat down first, waiting for the third one to arrive, and I noticed that it was actually pretty loud; we had to raise our voices to hear each other.   While waiting, the server responsible for our table brought us the menu, water, and left. I decided to read some more reviews on dish recommendations online, and found that there are actually daily specials that aren't included in the regular menu. We were only told that they existed after having asked the host if there were any tonight, and she went and had a talk with our server, probably about why we weren't told. I hope that if it were in that case, that the server did not hold any grudges 0_0.   FOOD: Friend 1 had the Vitello Americana(~26), which was the penne pasta with sautéed veal & shrimps in wine & tomato sauce, but she said it wasn't the best pasta she's had (her words not mine). Friend 2 ordered the Petto Di Pollo Valdostana(~24) deboned chicken breast saluted with slices of prosciutto - melted mozzarella in rose sauce. He claimed he could eat 3 plates more - I guess this dish does live up to its good reviews. /5  I had the grilled calamari (14.50) as appetizer, and one of the specials, the goat cheese & crab stuffed ravioli (19.50) (I'm a big fan of anything with goat cheese). The calamari came on a bed of vegetables (arugula?) and I have to say, the grilled squid was so tender and seasoned to perfection. Definitely recommend that one as a starter for you all. /5  Another server brought us their complimentary basket of hard crusted sliced bread and butter. The bread was a bit tough on the bite, but tasted quite nice with the spreaded butter.  Our entrees took ~20 minutes to arrive, which was the average waiting time for a packed place at 6pm.   The goat cheese and crab ravioli was drenched in the creamy tomato sauce, and I could barely see their outlines. In fact I think the taste of the pasta itself was empowered by the sauce, so all I could taste was the distinct sweet taste of the crab meat, which kind of tasted like imitation crab meat, but I didn't confirm that. So it was quite unfortunate to not being able to taste goat cheese at all.  When it came to dessert, Friend 1 ordered the creme brûlée(9.50) which was a hearty portion with a crunchy caramel layer and a smooth custard filling. /5   Friend 2 ordered the brownie cheese cake(9.50). I heard good reviews about the cappuccino(3.75), so I had that. However I forgot how bitter coffee was without sugar, and so that wasn't a good treat for me(it tasted much better after 2 creams and 2 sugars).   SERVICE: maybe I'm just too attentive to my surroundings, but the server wasn't as friendly with us as he was with the neighbouring table. Maybe it was because we were the only student-aged customers and weren't dressed as nice? I don't know, it just didn't feel like he really cared about our experience (or didn't even bother to pretend he did). Also, when the server was coming around to fill our waters, he failed to pour for me twice in a row (he only came twice), and my friends joked about that.  PRICE:  -the three of us each spent ~40$ excluding tips,  -didn't match their online menu pricing (which was cheaper by couple of dollars), but the online version did have a note at the bottom saying that prices are subject to change without notice.   -the prices for the specials weren't specified in the beginning, and they turned out more expensive than the regular pastas. (I thought special = special price)  PS:it'd be a better place for a dinner date, but you might want to sit in a more secluded area to avoid the noise. (There's a patio and a second floor)"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and it was absolutely amazing! The best thing about this place is the atmosphere. Its dim, moody lighting and the constant background chatter make this great for date nights or dinners with a close group of friends. The pasta (and its portions) are nothing to sniff at, but it's not the most memorable. Would return! But only to get stuffed on more gnocchi"}
{"text":"Donatello's is Toronto's best kept secret. It is consistently high quality Italian food that is fresh and homemade. The staff are friendly and attentive. I'd recommend the caprese salad, beef carpaccio and tortellini a la borina. The specials are always great too. It's a charming atmosphere and in the summer there are two great outdoor patios Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"(Review from 03/19/16)  Ordered the Beef Carpaccio, Vitello Piccata (veal), and Spumone. The carpaccio was a great appetizer to start. They plate was full, and the meat was served with shredded cheese and lemon wedges. The veal picatta dish came with carrots and broccoli on the side. Although I'm sure the meat was great, the taste from the lemon juice overwhelmed all other sauces and tastes. The meat was covered with way too much lemon juice, so every bite had that sour zing to it. No complaints about the dessert. Came for a friend's birthday. Great service for a large group of people, and complimentary tiramisu for the birthday man. Good price for great food and service overall."}
{"text":"We had a great diner yesterday,the food was excellent,everything we ordered met our expectations and I had asked for a quiet table for a romantic diner and they have been very kind and responded to our request."}
{"text":"This place was reccomended to us by the hotel Concierge at the Marriott. It must be a local hidden gem because on a Saturday night it wasn't overly crowded- despite being excellent. You get bang for your buck and everything was delicious. I had the Caesar salad and penne alla vodka. The penne alla vodka was not even on the menu but I got to talking to the waiter who was extremely knowledgeable on the menu and he made that recommendation/accommodation for me. The inside is super nice and has a fancy little Italy feel. I would go back in a heart beat both the salad and penne were the best I've had and the drinks were even good....not weak like the ones you get at some dining places. Also they give you a huge bread basket! If you are in Toronto and want some dank Italian food this place is without a doubt the way to go."}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious. We started with the bruschetta.  It was very flavorful snd seasoned perfect. I had the veal marsala. the veal was tender and melted in my mouth. My daughter had the pettit pollo valdostano. Excellent food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place when I saw the reviews, but was disappointed with my experience. I went with a large group, and our waiter just seemed annoyed that he had to deal with us even though we were quiet and polite.  Quite a number from our group had to ask several times for a wine list, even after we ordered our food. Often wine would just show up even though it hadn't been ordered yet and my friends just took it because they weren't sure when or if they'd get their order. One person asked for a wine list, and a glass of red showed up with \"I assumed red was fine?\".   Because of the big group, gratuity was included. I hope this wasn't to do with the waiter's attitude (knew he was getting a tip anyway), but I don't think he would have gotten half of what he did at the end. He didn't seem to have any other tables, and seemed very frazzled by ours.   I found the prices on the menu a bit high, but the food was pretty good. I had the gnocchi. I don't think I'd return based on my experience with the service though."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, delicious food and great service.  Although having dinner at the sound of bachata, regeton and hip hop was unexpected"}
{"text":"So maybe 5 out of 5 is premature as I have only been here once but I am so excited to go back again. The room is cozy and the staff was very attentive and very Italian which was great. I had the tortellini and I can still taste it when I think about it..the portions are huge too so sharing an appetizer and a pasta would be a great meal. While I went with a colleague (who had the butternut squash ravioli which was also amazing...) I think it would be an ideal date spot too."}
{"text":"They specified the gratuity (tip) on the bill. Won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant on a quaint street just off the madness of Yonge Dundas Square.  The staff if EXTREMELY friendly.  The Linguini con Vongole was the best I have ever had.  Looking forward to returning"}
{"text":"Good was amazing! Great atmosphere. There was a large group of us and all of us were more than happy with our food. Bang for the buck!"}
{"text":"Pricey but worth it, as the food is simple and delicious, with the gnocchi being especially a favorite. Excellent wine selection by the glass or by the bottle. The ambiance is intimate as the restaurant has many smaller rooms for dining and it did get a little loud as our section filled in. But this did not detract from a nice romantic dinner in the heart of downtown's busiest shopping district."}
{"text":"The rooftop patio is an excellent spot to enjoy the amazing food! The food is fresh with real, high quality ingredients! I had the crab ravioli which was absolutely awesome and the raspberry cheesecake has real raspberries not artificial flavour, it even had seeds in it! Friendly and helpful waiters and waitresses. Definitely worth going to for authentic Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"I love this place. The ambiance is warm and inviting, and the service and food was excellent.  I recommend the ravioli with crab with a glass of their house red.  I'll definitely be back, this is one of the better Italian restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"PROS - Food was great, absolutely delicious - server was good  CONS - Very loud - We ordered at 7:45 and our food came at about 8:38 very long wait - they forgot to give us bread and realized later - we asked for the cheque when we placed our order for dessert.. so lets say they take 5-7 mins to bring dessert.. 7-10 we eat the dessert.. in all that time they still hadn't brought us our bill.. finally when the bill came thhey only had ONE machine and a party of 7 was busy paying.. they got the machine 15 mins later.  so overall, i'd go back for the food but the service needs to up its game. #SorryNoTipForYou"}
{"text":"Warm service, cosy atmosphere, impressive wine selection and good food of couse.   Recommend the Calamari that has a nice smokiness to it. Per other reviews, Gnocchi is awesome and a must-try."}
{"text":"Good Italian food, I'd not say authentic thought. Service was decent. I dig the ambiance. Pretty decent wine selection as well."}
{"text":"My friend and I had dinner there this week. The goat cheese pineapple appetizer was delicious but next time we would share. I had the lamb ... Delicious. My friend had the ravioli and said it was amazing. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am giving them 3 starts for food quality only. Service is very good: beautiful lady at the door, very polite and knowledgeable waitress, etc. Décor and atmosphere is nice. However, food was just okay(ish) and definitely not worth its price. Menu could be more Italian than it is now. Drinks are \"compact\" size and feel too. There are other restaurants on Elm Street that can provide more for the same buck."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate at Donatello in August of 2014.  This restaurant has stood out in my mind so greatly that I still felt compelled to write a review almost 1 year later.  The atmosphere was romantic.  Each staff member was friendly.  The food.  Oh man, the food was out of this world.  I wouldn't say I am the authority on Italian, but Donatello cooked the best Italian food I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  We ate a bruschetta for starters which was delicious.  My girlfriend had a pesto pasta that she loved, I had some sort of pasta in a cream sauce with mushrooms, and it was delicious.  You can tell that almost everything (if not everything) is homemade from scratch every day.  I ate too much, as I am prone to doing, but everything was sooo good, that I had to have dessert.  We went with tiramisu.  I have had a number of tiramisus before, and I am often left feeling less than amazed by them.  This one ranked in the top 3 tiramisus I have had, so very good."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Donatello's tonight.  The atmosphere was nice...we were in the 2nd floor dining room.  It had a homey feel to it with grandma's hutch on one side of the room....personally, didn't care for the grape vine chandelier...but that's just me.  I ordered a Caprese salad, the minestrone soup, and the Penne Arrabiata...and a Coke.  I'm not comfortable rating the service tonight because it was our waiter's first night.    The Caprese came out with the soup (which is what I had asked for).  I tried the soup, but neither of us cared for the taste.  I did not eat the soup.  I am told however, that it is a traditional minestrone soup.  I think I was put off by the taste of escarole(?) I think it is.  They ended up voiding the soup from my bill - wasn't expecting that at all and it was quite nice of them to do that.   The salad itself had the slices of tomato with the cheese on top...but the tomatoes were swimming in some sort of oil/lemon mixture.  It was just too much.  A dry plate with a drizzle of olive oil would have sufficed.  We both ordered the Penne Arrabiata.  For me, the pasta was too el dente.  It was literally sticking to my teeth.  Not sure if that's a sign of fresh pasta or not...but I didn't enjoy it all that much.  The sauce was nice...but needed more spice.  Arrabiata is supposed to have a kick...this barely had a tickle.  2 Cokes, 1 Caesar Salad, 1 Caprese Salad, 2 Penne Arrabiata's - $67.  Pricey? Yes.  Worth it? Not really.  Would I go back? Only because of the customer service...but in all honestly, most likely no.    Hate writing a negative review...but it just didn't work tonight."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with several colleagues. The food was delicious, well-cooked, the prices were very affordable. We were seated on the second floor, where the atmosphere was very nice. It felt like home. The service was great too."}

I first found out about this place because my friend recommended it to me when we were trying to decide where to go for dinner. I've been to couple pasta places in downtown Toronto already such as Mercatto and Terroni but I am always up for some delicious pasta so I said yes.  We arrived around 7'ish and they asked us if we had reservation. We didn't and the only seats avail were outside on the patio of 2nd floor so we just decided to sit there. The balcony is small but really beautiful with all the rocks and greens creating this cave feel. However, note that there is no heater so it will get chilly.  Ordered: GRILLED CALAMARI 3/5 *2 medium sized calamari on greens for $ *Fresh grilled calamari on top of carrot pieces and salad *It was a little burnt but there was that very distinct 'grilled' taste *Sprinkled lemon and pepper on top for flavor *It didn't come with any sauce nor were there any on the salad *It was good on it's own but it felt kind of bland  Ordered: LINGUINI VONGOLE 4/5 *Pasta with Vongole(clams) is my favorite type of pasta, hands down *I was super excited to find this choice here because I didn't see it at Mercatto or Terroni *They offer fresh pepper and cheese on top *The bowl doesn't look that big, but it's very deep *Came with lots of small sized clams (around 15 or more) *I chose the white wine sauce *All the soup/white wine sauce sits on the bottom so make sure to mix it well *I couldn't even finish this pasta so I had to take the leftover home(YAY for leftover pasta) *This pasta was so good and so far my favorite in Toronto  Ordered: CRAB AND GOAT CHEESE RAVIOLI 4/5 *Off of Special menu of the day for $ *My friend ordered this so I just tried a bite of it *It comes with 5-6 big ravioli pieces topped with creamy tomato sauce *Inside is filled with crab pieces and goat cheese *crab and goat cheese goes very well together, creating a creamy velvety filling perfect for the thin ravioli *Creamy tomato sauce was bursting with flavor and it went really well with the pasta  Ordered: SHRIMPS ALLA DIAVOLA 3/5 *Shrimps in spicy garlic oil from Lunch Appetizer menu for $12.95 *Around 10 medium sized shrimp dunked in garlic butter sauce *Sauce is perfect for dipping bread *This appetizer tastes really good with the complimentary bread *Shrimp could be a little bigger *Kind of on the pricey side  Summary: Service was excellent both times I went. Everyone working there starting from host to busser is super friendly and genuine. I love the laid back italian home atmosphere and feel like I can enjoy my meal there without any pressure and enjoy my time there. Next time I go back, I would like to have the full course Italian meal with dessert and wine :)"}
{"text":"This place was GREAT. We had a dinner with the father in law here. The food was authentic and delicious; they accommodated our vegeterian requirements easily and happily. My favorite sparkling Cremant is here as the cheapest sparkling option.  Basically, was a win in every way, up to and including the dessert!  (Also was quite authentic - 2 Catholic Italian priests in full garb spent 2 hours finishing their meal next to us. It was like a snapshot of Rome...)  The atmosphere is lovely, if slightly on the noisy side if there are 2 large groups nearby. Wish it was a tiny bit quieter. That said, this is a good place for groups."}
{"text":"My husband and I are in Toronto on vacation. Our concierge recommended Donatello's. We shared their Tomato Salad and special of the day if Angel Hair pasta either lobster meat in a creamy tomato/ wine sauce....ah heaven!!!! To cap off the delicious meal we ordered tiramisu. I would highly recommend this place! The atmosphere was pleasant and we never felt rushed through our meal...very relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous. Pasta was soaked in oil, never the less the fact that it was made with artificial crab. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Service was excellent!! It was a very intimate restaurant, perfect for me and my boyfriends anniversary dinner! The food was phenomenal. I highly recommend the tiramisu for dessert. You simply can not go wrong with whatever you order. Great specials. On the more expensive side, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"My takeaways from the dinning experience:  1) The venue was nice 2) The grilled calamari was okay 3) My girlfriend and I waited an entire hour and 15 minutes from when we ordered our entrées, which is inexcusable. Usually if this happens, (which is not uncommon in restaurants since mistakes are inevitable), the restaurant will compensate you in some way (e.g. giving you a credit on your bill or a free dessert) but there was no compensation provided. 4) When the entrées finally arrived, my girlfriend's dish (which I can't remember) was okay but not worth the price, and as for my lamb chops, the smell was putrid and they tasted disgusting.  If a dish is poor tasting in my opinion, I would never write off a restaurant. I would simply go back and try another dish BUT these lamb chops were so rancid tasting, not to mention that I was starving after waiting a full hour, that my entire opinion of the restaurant has been coloured.  I only visited this restaurant because of all the positive reviews, so either that was an off night or the restaurant has really gone down hill."}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable prices and ambiance.    Service on spot and there is underground parking directly across street.    I would caution that you do not press the 'time' button over and over as the crappy preciselink machine will easily let you go to $30-$40 dollar, the next day.   I parked there for $10 @ 6pm and parking is free after 7 pm."}
{"text":"Having not been here for over a year, and yet remembering the fantastic pasta dishes from my previous two visits, I decided to revisit Donatello as the pre-theatre \"birthday dinner treat\" for my mother-in-law.   The service was absolutely spectacular, while the waiter, Louis, was charming and entertaining, attentive and also keenly up-selling, he was not pushy, and his recommendations were, in fact, highly on-point and much more satisfying than expected.  Case in point, his wine suggestion (at $3 more than our initial choice) was miles ahead in flavour and quality.  All three of us went for the evening specials, the husband and I choosing the veal chop (with pasta side), and the mother-in-law (MIL) going for the tilapia special with veggie/potato side. The veal was the most mouth-meltingly, point perfect dish that I have ever had. The MIL was very happy with her tilapia, flaky, tasty, and crisp side veggies. The side pasta was boxed penne, but the rose sauce was delicious.  The one area where the restaurant faltered was on desserts. We each tried a different one, tiramisu, red velvet cake, and creme brulee, and were somewhat disappointed in each, especially on the price point ($8.50 per). The red velvet cake was somewhat dense and dry, and smacked of the assembly-line desserts manufactured for the restaurant industry. The creme brulee was nice, but nothing special, and the small tiramisu square was somewhat of a let down, again reminiscent of an assembly-line dessert, and not an in-house treasure, passed down by Nonna.   All in all, we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent shrimp alla diavolo appetizer; the oil with garlic, chili peppers, parsley had tremendous flavor.  The veal Marsala was also outstanding.  Service was very attentive but not over attentive.  Donatello's was strongly recommended by Ralph at the Marriott on Bay Ave. as the best Italian restaurant we could go to in downtown Toronto.  We wholeheartedly agree!  Thanks Ralph!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place to take my aunt visiting from LA. We were surprised to find out that the food was amazing and the service extraordinary and friendly (we were even in our track clothes).  Dewan, our server is the best, my 11 year old son loved him. He was friendly and very attentive to our needs. His attention to detail was superb and had a great a sense of humour.  Absolutely fabulous and truly excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, food super fresh and tasty, love the fact that they let you use cheese on my sea food if I want but it was really good that I didn't need too. Food came in a good time. Totally recommended."}
{"text":"I'm torn. I came here for an anniversary dinner. The restaurant itself is intimate and the service was enjoyable enough. But oh my, was the food ever disappointing. For the price, it's just... blah. Not absolutely terrible, but just plain boring. The bread to start was super crunchy, much too hard, stale almost. I got the carpaccio for my appetizer, one of my favourite dishes. It's a difficult dish to screw up so it was fine enough, but I've certainly had better. Then I got spaghetti as my main. First of all for an Italian restaurant I have to say their pasta selection was quite bad. Only two contained meat, one sausage, one seafood. Almost all were in a cream based sauce. The spaghetti was so incredibly mediocre. No meatballs, nothing at all standout or special about the tomato sauce, and I'm not even sure the pasta was made in house. For the price, no thanks, I could have just had store bought spaghetti at home."}
{"text":"We made a reservation and we arrived we were asked to wait 10 minutes as our table wasn't ready. Then we realized the prices do not match the prices displayed on their website. Their menu inside the restaurant as 1$ more expensive. Honesty doesn't seem important to them.  We waited 40 min before being served.  The only good point is the food that is very good. But we expect more from a restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of colleagues for a birthday celebration and was very impressed with the service we received. However, it is definitely pricey, especially for those of us that ordered wine with our meal.  We were forced to use the $50 price fix menu since we were a group. I ordered the minestrone soup, grilled salmon filet, and tiramisu. I also had the house white wine.  Let me start off with the minestrone soup -- this was a very big disappointment. The soup had far too many vegetables and was too heavy. Other places serve very light minestrone soup, which I prefer. This one is only good if you really like spinach and carrots overpowering the flavor of your soup. However, the grilled salmon filet made up for that experience. It was absolutely delicious, perfectly soft, and the lemon cream sauce added the perfect flavor. It was also served with a side of alfredo linguine with mushrooms, which was a very light for an alfredo dish.  The wine and tiramisu were both nice, however, I definitely felt that it was a pricey menu.  But I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience in the private dining room, which was worth the splurge."}
{"text":"Went there for an anniversary dinner. Really good food with an authentic Italian twist. I loved my veal Marsala., finished it off with the tiramisu which is the most popular dessert on the menu. The place is a bit cramped but well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Very disappointing and pathetic service. We decided to have a friends get togather and chose Donatello Restuarant for some good italian food. The decor is pretty cute and seems like an upscale restuarant when you walk in. We were asked to sit upstairs for the group of 6.. Its quite intimate and space challenged at the top floor. The table was a bit wobbly but nothing major.    I decided to order Tortellini Alla Borina and substituted sausage with chicken. The creamy soup with peas just didnt do any good to the palette, for the price I paid (17.95$). Moreover, the service was pathetic.. we had a server named Marco, he was not polite/ courteous at all. If you are having a bad day.. may be you should not be serving dude. He took half of the groups credit and then would disappear to come back for rest of the groups payment and made us wait extra 20 mins in that process.    There are way better choices in this area. Thoroughly disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"I rarely, okay perhaps never, have written a review of a restuarant on Yelp.  This may be my first, but I had to give my highest praise to one of the best waitresses I have encountered in all my travels around the world.  Carina!  As a solo diner this evening, I had ample opportunity watch Carina as she calmly and efficiently worked a busy restaurant.  To give you a sense of her expertise, as a new table was seated, Carina would greet the new guests with smiles as if she were inviting them to her home.  When describing the specials of the day, she did so with such finess using appetizing descriptions, hand gestures and eye contact that rendered the menu superfluous.  Even though she was addressing a table of people, her engaging manner felt as if she was talking just to you.  It's very clear that Carina takes a personal interest in ensuring the experience at Donatello is a good as it can be.   This evening was a great success becuase of the eggplant appetizer special - which was superb - but primarily because of Carina and her welcoming manner.  Thank you for a very nice experience."}
{"text":"The food is not great. It was a wonderful patio, great wine, awesome server Louis. We had such a great night but the food was just ok. I had the scallop and shrimp pasta and my husband had the veal. I have had better at national chains but Louis and the patio and the wine and the conversation was SO much fun. And it is across the street from our hotel so that scores points too. Tough review."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for my birthday. Everything was very good. Had bruschetta caprese salad penne arrabiata  - all was great and the service was excellent! Great value and very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Recalling from my experience from a year ago (where a brief review was left on Google instead of yelp cuz I forgot).  My entire party felt the server had a bit of an attitude. Instead of listening to what my request was, he interrupted me with an answer even when that wasn't what I was about to ask. I told the server that our guest of honour's bill would be on me (at least twice, to two different people) and to bring her bill to me instead, and the bill still went to her instead of me.  But good food. And the food came relatively quickly even though it was a fairly big party. Overall a decent experience but I wouldn't be coming again.  Quality: 7.5/10. Services: 4/10. Value: 6.5/10. Overwall 6.5/10 (Not an average)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best Italian in the GTA when it brings its A-game, but its game is as consistent as [insert whatever Toronto sports franchise we're currently disappointed in]. The owner's mom hand-makes all the pasta - though I suspect it's not always fresh (though fresh on busy nights). When it is fresh, it is chewy in that perfect, traditional way. My favourite meal here is the scallops and shrimp pasta; the seafood is clean and mouth-melting. However, on another occasion I had veal and it was tough and the gravy way way too salty - and I'm a salt FIEND. Caesar dressing tastes like it's bottled. Ambiance is romantic, decor is traditional and fabulous. You will not likely know all the wines on their list, so get some advice from the waitstaff."}
{"text":"I had the best time at our first restaurant experience in Toronto. We started with prosciutto cantaloupe and shrimp cocktail. Both were good but the cocktail sauce was a little sweet. Our wine was amazing and did the trick when pairing with our main course. I had a deal Macada and any crab a girl cheese ravioli pass on a tomato cream sauce. Both meals were amazing. I would recommend thus cute little Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I had dinner here while on a weekend trip to Toronto. My Mom had heard it was good so we tried it out. Our meal was great. As an appetizer we had the shrimp alla diavola - and with the warm bread it was great. For entrees, I had goat cheese & crab ravioli and my Mom had butternut squash ravioli. Both dinners were delicious. The portions were plentiful - we didn't have room for dinner.    The thing that I loved about Toronto was that the restaurants go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Donatello was no exception. Our host was enthusiastic and attentive and we didn't have to wait long for our dishes.  The restaurant is pricey (our bill came to $106 with alcohol) but its well worth it. I'm a New Yorker so its not out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Non rushed , great food. I had carpaccio, capresse and clams and linguini.  The most impressive is that after tasting and accepting. Bottle of wine I decided I wanted a different bottle and they changed to it no questions asked. I stayed well after close and never felt rushed. Very friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was so romantic! The people so nice and made sure we felt like we had the best table. I had the carpaccio and tortellini and man, I'd eat that again!"}
{"text":"From the exterior to the interior of this fine Italian restaurant, its intimate setting and Italian inspired decor will delight any guests looking for a memorable dining experience. There were 7 of us and we had a lovely round table perfectly tugged away which provided us with some privacy. We all tried different dishes and they were all great. Their extensive wine list was amazing. I am most impressed by the care and attention of their staff. By the end of our dinner we wanted to come back the next night as their menu was extensive + they have daily specials that are equally delightful and mouthwatering. Donatello is definitely a hidden gem in the city. I can go there every night while in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian restaurants I have eaten at. The pasta and seafood dishes we had were perfection. We also had a minestrone soup that was amazing. Everything had so much great flavor! They were also very accommodating with my toddler. It isn't really a restaurant for children (no kids menu), but they offered her noodles which she loved! They even gave her a scoop of ice cream which I thought was very nice. The ambiance of the place was very nice. We sat on their very cute terrace which made me feel like I wasn't even in the middle of a bustling city. The staff were very attentive as well without being bothersome. I will definitely be back if I am ever in town."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Enjoyed the butternut squash ravioli in a tasty cream sauce. My co workers all had excellent meals. Would happily go again."}
{"text":"I don't understand any of the negative reviews of this place! My boyfriend and I went here for Valentine's Day and it was absolutely lovely. We were seated upstairs in a quiet and cozy room with candles on each table. A full menu was offered as well as specials. We split the house salad and for entrees I ordered the shrimp and scallops with pasta and he ordered the lamb chops. One or two scallops were a bit tough but otherwise my meal was delicious. The lamb was super tender. We shared the brownie cheesecake for dessert which came with a cute heart design on the plate. I feel that it was reasonably priced but I may have a skewed perception as I'm from the NYC area. Each woman was given a long stem red rose after dinner which was also a nice extra. I would recommend this place for a nice romantic evening."}
{"text":"This place was adorable.  Truly.  Such excellent service and we took every recommendation of our server and the pasta was out of this world.  K8 was craving pesto, so I told them she was pregnant over the phone, and hey explained that they didn't care- either way they had pesto pasta available.  It was a ravioli!  I had spaghetti 2000 (real name of the dish, very futuristic) and with their special tomato sauce with a touch of cream (also recommended).  I was upset with myself for having eaten at all earlier that day. I assure you, I will be having spaghetti 2000 for breakfast.  I actually ate a lot of it, so tomorrow morning it's spaghetti 1,500 and pesto for my baby.  A MUST if you are in the mood for Italian food, charming ambience and the kind of staff you would like to join your extended family.   BRAVISSIMO!"}
{"text":"I really don't know what to say that the other yelper's haven't already.  The food is delicious.  The portions are generous and yes it is a bit pricy.  The service was great and I loved the adorable glass blown oil/vinegar bottles.  The vinegar bottle looks like a little apothecary bottle inside the oil bottle.  Silly to point out, I know :)"}
{"text":"We were greeted by a friendly staff and it continued throughout the evening. They took it upon themselves to split our single appetizer order of Caprese Salad - wonderful on the taste buds. Their bread is tasty. Keeping my water glass full is a sign of excellent service. We cleaned our plates, the Tortellini Borina and the Veal Piccata. The ambiance is \"intimate.\" We found the price in line for this wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"I came here with family a while back and had a good experience. The pasta we had was not very memorable but the traditional bruschetta was really good. The grilled calamari was ok. Not one of the best that I've tried"}
{"text":"Delicious gnocchi. Been here twice.  Good service although they are a little pushy on the upsell.  But I understand it.   I'd recommend going to friends.  I'll go back again. But maybe I'll try something new.    Caprese salad is great too and the free warm bread at the start :)"}
{"text":"I'd probably give them 3.5 stars if I could. We were encouraged to come in by the friendly service and coaxing from the gentleman at the door. He made every effort to find us a seat of our choosing despite it being extremely busy. The waitress who seated us was also amazing. Those 2 get 5+ stars. However, it then took almost an hour to get our food, the chef was obviously overextended and the food was not bad but not great. I wouldn't rush back but I would be curious how they might do if they had a few less patrons to keep happy.  We ordered the Gamberoni Alla Griglia which was difficult/messy to eat and the Gnnochi Donatello which was just A-OK."}
{"text":"What a great find for good Italian food, with a cozy atmosphere and very reasonable prices. This place has been in business for over 30 years and the chef had been there for over 25 years, so it makes a big difference in the food. Their great staff provided excellent service. Being vegetarians, it is hard to find such good food, but the selection they have allows variety - They were even willing to create a special dish for me from one of the regular menu items. Don't overlook this little gem on Elm."}
{"text":"Four of us met for dinner at this long established restaurant. We arrived at around 7.30pm and the waiting staff were run off their feet.....it was so busy.  After being shown to the table we were offered pre dinner drinks and given good time to make our decisions. The nightly specials were explained although the level of noise made for some difficulties in understandings...  We all had starters and the selections were the melon and ham, caprese salad and the calamari.....the calamari was tasty and sufficient however the tomato and the melon were a little under ripe. The mozzarella was not good.....  The mains were big and variable....the lamb was good, the pastas were enjoyable however the chicken was a little disappointing...certainly too dry.  We made a special request for the wine.....open and decant at the time of order.....unfortunately in the haste of the night this did not occur and I suppose this oversight sums up the night.  There just was not that sense of making it a special occasion......it felt more like it was a place where it is a business to the turn the 'covers' over..."}
{"text":"I visited Donatello while on a 3 day long road trip. I found the level of dignity and joy in the serving style of the restaurant to be wonderfully refreshing. I visited here on a busy Saturday evening. Upon arrival, we were instantly greeted, our coats were taken, water was served and bread was placed on our table all within 30 seconds. The service here was attentive, but what was wonderful about this restaurant is the giant middle finger it shows to American style dining and I hope the dignity of the servicing style here starts a worldwide movement.  Upon arriving, the first thing I noticed was the very low volume of music in the restaurant, and the slow and wonderfully romancing aura of the interior. The music was low enough to be easily ignored but high enough to be enjoyed if a patron wanted it to be. Other restaurant patrons seemed to be sincerely happy to enjoy their company and we found the overall pace to be simply wonderful.  You won't find booming music and servers doing everything they possibly can to push patrons in and out of seats as soon as possible at Donatello. Instead, True to European style, the restaurant assumes that a guest arriving will enjoy the table and their company for several hours. This is wildly refreshing and a welcome change to the typical hustle of most North American restaurant experiences.   The food was also excellent. I had the lasagna while my companion had the gnocchi. The lasagna was well done with tangy and perfectly baked cheese while the Gnocchi had a surprisingly unexpected tart bite at the end that was just delicious. The breads, sauces and wines all complemented each other well while still remaining authentic.  Upon completing my meal, we found beverage refill service and wine service continued even after we completed deserts. It was clear that the staff expected us to enjoy ourselves and went out of their way to make sure our experience was wonderful, relaxing, warm and that we would come back again and again. I was honestly surprised the restaurant didn't have an auto-gratuity or mention the European serving style upon arrival to guests - perhaps that would do more to enhance the experience for other diners.  The environment, coupled with the excellent service was a highlight of my trip to Toronto and I look forward to returning the next time I have the good fortune to visit. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday. It is close to Dundas Station and there is street parking available. Upon arrive, it felt like a very classy restaurant. Cute and intimate decor and a place to hang your coats (coat rack was outside our dining room so don't leave anything valuable in your coats just in case). Servers were very patient (some of our party arrived quite late).  For the cost of each dish, I was pretty disappointed in mine. I ordered the Tortellini Alla Borina ($17.95) and substituted the sausage for chicken. The first few bites were good, but then I realized how salty the dish was. I couldn't finish it because it was so salty. There are other Italian restaurants in the area that I would suggest over this place."}
{"text":"Really great Italian food in the heart of Toronto.  We found it because it was right across the street from our hotel.  My girlfriend had a crab and goat cheese ravioli and I had the grilled veal chop.  Both were excellent except for the fact that the veal was a tad salty.  However I like minimal salt so I think most would have thought it was perfectly seasoned.  Our server was on top of everything and kept the wine coming.  I would recommend this place if you are ever in Toronto or if you are lucky enough to live there."}
{"text":"This was an incredibly pleasant surprise. I'd give them 5 stars but the gnocchi wasn't the best I've ever had. We had a wonderful time and our waiter was incredible. He knew everything about wine, which is really important to us. We loved the tomato salad. We were just happy walking our. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great meal. We came in very hungry, especially our 9 year old daughter. They put her spaghetti and meatballs order I right away and it came out really fast. Love when servers work hard to accommodate a hungry kid. I had the spaghetti pescatore, with lots of seafood and a wonderful al dente pasta and a slightly spice sauce. Delish! Would eat this every night. My wife had the gnocchi, very unique, homemade pasta with a brown nutty sauce.   The service was wonderful and our daughter says \"The food is amazing and delicious and I want to come back.\"  We will certainly come back!"}
{"text":"Really expensive (especially if you also buy wine), but really good. One of those places in Toronto that I would recommend splurging on if you must. The sidewalk patio and inside are all super romantic at night, particularly with the little strings of lights on the trees and the candles. Also the place doesn't seem to get very packed, even at dinner time, so it is possible to converse with indoor voices here.  Vegetarians can survive here, yes! But I think the meats and fish here are what defines Donatello, so for the price it might not be worth it to come if you are vegetarian/vegan.  For apps- their grilled calamari I highly recommend! Super tender and flavorful! And not coated with annoying and unhealthy batter.  For mains- their pastas are very fresh... and possibly made in-house? I can't remember. I recommend any and all of their seafood dishes (squid, lots of squid!), but the veal dishes are also extremely tasty and tender (this meal occurred before I converted to pescatarianism). I never enjoyed red meats, even pre-pesco days, but the veal served here really did win me over with the flavors. For desserts- it's really hard to ever go wrong with sweets, but compared to their savory foods I found the tiramisu and cakes here disappointingly generic. I would actually recommend skipping dessert here and walking a block or so to Yonge or Bay and Dundas to sample Toronto's ice cream scene instead.   As for dress code, not mandatory, but I found that customers tended to dress nicely and respectfully, but not suit-n-tie/cocktail-dress level of nice."}
{"text":"Pricey!  Had the salmon fettuccine special with a drink on the rocks.  Waited a long time for our food...almost an hour, asked for another order of bread. It was a cute romantic place and we sat upstairs. Expected a bit more in terms of the service and our meal taking forever. However, I would give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend and I must say the food was amazing. The service was great from the moment we walked up to the hostess to he moment we left. Although, the time between our appetizer and entree did seem a bit long. It was justified when we realized that most of the pastas we made in house. You could taste the freshness of each strand of pasta. Even the complementary bread was crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy in the inside.  We ended up dipping the bread into the mussles sauce. I can't really comment on the price go because my girlfriends took me out for my bachelorette and treated me. All in all, a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went there last week, had the CARPACCIO as an appetizer and Lamb chops as main. Food was decent and different nothing too special. Service was okay but the appetizers took around 25 mins to come out and the main after 50 minutes which was pretty long wait for a quick lunch break.. Fair experience but wont be returning there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Fabulous experience here. The food was great and the service was exceptional. The staff went out of their way to make us feel at home on our 5th anniversary celebration.   Pasta and sauces were homemade and out of this world good. You'll need reservations, and the food is very reasonably priced. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Highly recommend. Just a little hole in the wall place. But well worth stopping by"}
{"text":"Hubby and I made a reservation at this restaurant after seeing the Yelp reviews.  I did not receive a call back to confirm so when I called the restaurant the day of the reservation, the young woman who answered thanked me for calling. We arrived a few minutes early and the young woman who greeted us seemed flustered.  We were seated at one of the last remaining tables and there was no 'reserved' sign on the table so we weren't sure that if we had arrived on time if our reservation would have been honored.  The wine list was exhaustive but very pricey...we settled on a nice bottle of Chianti and ordered an appy while we waited for our friends since we were famished.  We saw the other tables had some bread, so we asked for some (3 times before it came).  When our friends arrived, we all ordered different dishes, including gnocchi, ravioli and a lamb special.  The gnocchi was chewy, but the ravioli was pretty good. My hubby was disappointed that there was no option for a lactose-free dessert.  I was expecting a lot more of a gastronomical experience given the reviews of this restaurant.  It was just so-so."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Donatello's last weekend. It was for my wife's birthday and we had a large group of 11 as it was the whole family joining for dinner. Everyone was impressed with the delicious food, the great service, and the ambiance. We got the little room upstairs by the bar, and we had the whole are to ourselves, which made it a very relaxing atmosphere. I must say for the way the food is prepared, and presented, the prices are very very reasonable. I apologize for not remembering our waiters name, but he was great, kept a very good conversation flowing with the crowd while we waited for the food. I remember he is originally from Rio :) Great guy! Great restaurant. We plan to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for my birthday and it was awesome. The restaurant is a cute little place, very friendly staff, really makes you feel appreciated!  I had the goat cheese with eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, some greens, and pineapple... I was a little hesitant about it since I wasn't sure how all those flavors would go together but boy it was goooood!! And it wasn't heavy at all, surprisingly considering there was a large piece of goat cheese on there!  Then for the main we had the lamb and it was perfectly done! The staff also recommended the crab ravioli which was just amazing.  At the end we had tiramisu for dessert (and yes they sang me happy birthday, I have yet to go kill my friend for the embarrassment) at first I was afraid it would he too heavy but it was actually very light and not too sweet!  All in all, the service was fantastic and the food was perfect! Amazing place. Loved it."}
{"text":"What a gem! I was in town for a conference, and with some friends started wandering the streets in search of a place for dinner. We stumbled on this adorable restaurant.  First of all, the whole staff were friendly and engaging. We were warmly welcomed in, and shown to the bar while they prepared our table. We ordered a drink, and relaxed. When the people occupying our table lingered, they came up, apologized, and brought us some bruschetta on the house to tide us over.  We were shown back downstairs to the tiny dining room, and had the most warm server, Catalina. We each got a salad (caprese for two of us, a seasonal offering for the third)--all bursting with freshness and flavor. Two of us got the ravioli specials, which were unbelievable. I got the crab and goat cheese, with a red pepper cream sauce, and my friend got the butternut squash ravioli. You could tell these were just made. Our other friend got one of the veal dishes, which she thoroughly enjoyed. Since we were all on travel budget, the waitress split the check three ways--no hesitation.  I found the service to be friendly, warm and attentive. On top of that, the food was so carefully prepared. A real treat!"}
{"text":"Came in at 10 o'clock on a Tuesday night; no reservations and we were seated right next to a window with beautiful Christmas decorations. The service was incredibly quick, and our server was incredibly knowledgeable with all things with and informed us with the day's special. I ordered the cheese stuffed tortellini with white cream sauce and mushroom (minus the sausage), while my date ordered a lamb chomp with vegetables. He said the lamb chomp was delicious, tender and good, although pretty well done for a \"rare\" steak as he ordered. My pasta was one of the best ones I ever had in my life! So absolutely delicious!! Before we feasted we started with their classical bruschetta. It's only 4 pieces, and although it's delicious in terms of the spices places on the fresh tomato, it really isn't worth it after stuffing your face with the fresh warm brews and whipped artisan butter served as soon as you seated. All in all, delicious food with lovely Italian music that sets an ambient mood and relaxed romantic vibes. Dim lights all around ensure for a captivating conversation!    TLDR; amazing food & great service, perfect spot for a date!!   P.S. there's a \"suggested\" gratuity of 15% that the server informs you of. We tipped 20% on a 110$+tax bill because of the lovely service!"}
{"text":"A girlfriend took me here for my birthday celebration. Loved the ambience here, and we were lucky enough to be seated on the upper deck patio. Beautiful space - the deck was covered by a huge tree decorated by fairy lights. This made it feel like we were in a completely differently place altogether, away from the hustle and bustle of Downtown Toronto.   The room next to the upper deck had a family celebrating a birthday; and there was a lady playing the accordion for them. Almost felt like we were in Italy!  I'm giving this restaurant a 3 stars rating solely because of the food. I had the Zuppa Di Pesce, which I asked the sauce to be replaced with the rosé sauce.  I wasn't very impressed with the pasta considering the price. Both in taste and in the seafood quality.   Service at this restaurant was great - we casually brought up that it was my birthday and they brought a complimentary tiramisu as a surprise! So wonderful!   I would certainly come back here for drinks/appetizer considering how amazing the space is!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on the last night of our Toronto vacation.  For an appetizer we had the grilled calamari. It was served grilled to perfection and uncut. Aces.  For the entree, I had the deboned chicken sauteed with sliced prosciutto and mozzarella served in a rose sauce. It was okay. The sauce was more of a ala vodka sauce to me.  My other half had the broiled lamb chops. They were very good.  For dessert we shared a tiramisu. It was pretty loose. They said they just made it fresh. Tasty, but disappointing."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight the food was ok. The portions were small. The service was good. The bill was quite expensive for what we ordered. The place was kind of small and cramped and busy they should have tables spaced further apart."}
{"text":"The food here was exceptional, and the wine and wine selection were fantastic. When we arrived on a weekday evening as a party of two, it was a bit confusing at first when we walked in, and it took a bit for someone to help us. When they seated us, we were practically on top of the people next to us, which made conversation tough. The lighting is probably supposed to be mood lighting, but just made it tough to read the menus. Nonetheless, the food was beyond worth any hassle."}
{"text":"Had lunch service here - Caesar salads and veal Marsala.  All around good flavours and friendly service.  Wished there was a bit more meat (sauce was tasty!).    My guest had the clam linguine.  Didn't look like there was any sauce to speak of but he ate the clams and a small bit of the pasta.  If I come back I do not think I'd have the linguini.  There are some really great Italian restaurants around and this one has potential but isn't great for what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"We walked in at 7pm on a Friday got lucky with a table for 3 available. The service wasn't very welcoming, I couldn't understand what the server was saying because it was so loud and they didn't seem very comfortable speaking louder. The pasta is overpriced at $20+ for a serving that did not taste freshly made, and included no meat. The caprese salad was also overpriced for using hot house tomatoes and dried basil - not flavorful. The house wine was fine. The bruschetta was the best thing about the evening."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Didn't even know it existed on Elm Street. My friend brought me here before a show nearby. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and classy. The waiter was super nice and attentive throughout the evening. All of us ordered the butternut squash ravioli. Oh my goodness it was so delicious. I usually hate cream sauce but this did not taste like super creamy at all. It was just perfect. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are downtown and want a good butternut squash ravioli! I would come back again and try something different on the menu."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner here as the reviews are pretty amazing - especially on google. Staff was more than welcoming and made our experience great. For dinner, we ordered the spaghetti 2000 with tomato cream sauce and the linguine with clams. Both pastas were soooo delicious, the clams especially were so fresh. After reading some of the negative Yelp reviews, I would probably recommend sticking with the plain pasta dishes/the seafood."}
{"text":"I was craving gnocchi so my friend took me here for ny birthday. It was extremely classy, even the exterior of the building was quaint. The server was extremely attentive and even used a special scrapper to clean the crumbs off our table after eating the crunchy bruschetta. Although there were many fancy looking appetizers, I had to choose the bruschetta as its a simple classic that I love. I tried it with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar that they had on the table as well. It was so flavourful! The gnocchi was fresh with an amazing sauce. The server sprinkled cheese and pepper. I wish I had asked for more cheese and pepper (it looked like a lot of pepper but I actually did not taste much since it was so finely grinded). My friend got the cheese filled ravioli. I was expecting it to be cheesy but it was a harder, more crumbly dry cheese instead. The sauce was light. It was yummy but not as flavourful as the gnocchi I felt. Overall, I would reccomend this place to others and would love to come again to try something else!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant located a stone's throw away from the Delta Chelsea. The concierege reccomended this fabulous little place to us and it was an outstanding choice.   It was here that I ordered my first glass of Pinot Grigio (legally). Their wine list is extensive and their sides are amazing. I personally recommend the asparagus.   The ambiance is a little more quiet...I would suggest whoever you dine with has some manners because it is a very understated yet formal environment.   Great for a quiet evening and perhaps a show later."}
{"text":"Was in town on business and decided to stop at Donatello's as it was nearby my hotel. Besides you can never go wrong with Italian food :). The roof top dining is nice but quaint. The pasta was plenty and tasty and the creme brûlée dessert was one of the best that I had in awhile.  Prices are not cheap so just keep walking by if you are looking for something on the cheap side. The only downfall were the bees hovering around the table. Guess that is to be expected when dining outside. Would go back again"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong - 1 star for the restaurant itself is definitely too small. The food is great, the prices are great, (except that you have to be careful - they try to bring you water in open bottles that are like $9 each), but that's not a problem. Our dinner today for my wife's birthday was spoiled by one arrogant waiter - Roberto. The was a number of things why his service wasn't that great, but in addition to those a couple of  things made me want to leave a smaller tip.  I gave them a cake to bring out after we finish the dinner and they took forever to bring it - we almost finished our tea by then. Even after I reminded the waiter he took so long that the birthday girl and we didn't want any desert by then. Finally we got our cake (btw the charge is $4 per person for them to cut it) and asked for the receipt right away. When I got the receipt, I wasn't given an option how much to pay in tip, which is ridiculous given that we were only a group of 3. The mandatory \"suggested\" tip was %18. I asked the water to change the settings so that I could leave my own tip. I gave 10% (I truly don't think the service was good for a normal 15%). our bill came to around $160 before tip. The waiter was so unsatisfied that he started asking me several times in front of the birthday girl and her friend why I \"undertipped\" him, as if he is entitled to those 18%.  However, again, the food was very good and if you get a different waitress your experience hopefully will be completely different."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner. Antipasto Salad was delicious and my husband and I shared it. The service from the entire staff was flawless, never missed a beat. Lamb chops were cooked to perfection. Veal Marsala was so tender it was melting! A real treat. This is a gem of a place for dinner."}
{"text":"I met 6 girl friends here for dinner. One of them had previously been. I've eaten on Elm before it's a great little area. Service was fabulous. Constant replenishment of hot bread. All of us had their Ravioli specials made fresh in house - they were excellent. I had the Tallapia in a fresh tomato sauce(not rose) and a side of crab Ravioli - very tasty. For dessert I shared a Carrot cake - oh soo fresh. Definitely would return to try more!"}
{"text":"I was in the restaurant tonight had a wonderful meal kudos to the chef but at the end my brother-in-law made a mistake with the tip and a server rudely came over and loudly said was there a problem with the service I am in the industry and I find this appalling"}
{"text":"Had a spectacular dinner on 3/15/2016 here. I was in town with a client and had a dinner for 6 of us, including 1 vegetarian. Dinner here was simply great. No exaggeration, from the wine (Amarone) to everyone's dinner, to dessert, each person said the same thing - \"my meal was excellent\"!  Excellent is an understatement, this place was really good. Excellent service, good atmosphere and great food, can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today.  I had the Minestrone soup - delicious!  Large portion chock full of chunky vegetables.  The butternut squash ravioli's in a cream sauce were delicious.  The filling was very very hot and although the portion doesn't look huge, the ravioli's were so enormous and filing I was not able to finish them.  This was not a low carb lunch but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Is this the best Italian food I've ever eaten? No, but I eat my Italian food in Italy so my standards are pretty high. That said they have a very solid kitchen. The ambience is very nice. It's in an old row house and it feels like eating in someone's home (a nice person's home!). The service gets five+++ stars. The house manager who was there the two times I was there was ON! The staff hustles and aims to please. I wish all the restaurants were like this. If you want a place where you can get very good Italian food at a reasonable price and be very well taken care of, this is the place for you. I give it four stars only because if someone is expecting total world class Italian food, it's not quite there, but the food is very good and I was completely satisfied with it."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and a second trip to Donatello would be required to get a better idea of the quality food. I can't recall what exactly did I order, but I think it was ravioli. They have a pretty conservative decor, which is probably due for an update, but the chef in the kitchen is doing a pretty good job with the food. Next time I'm around Yonge/Dundas and happen to be craving some Italian food, I'll make sure to pay another visit to Donatello. Id suggest you check out the photos on Yelp and you'll get a good idea if they take their food seriously."}
{"text":"The taste of the steak and lamb chop are really just ok. Do not recommend. Shrimp cocktail's is really like the package shrimp bought from Costco."}
{"text":"Salads were good, but entrees were nothing to remember of... especially seafood items...stick to other items for your choice... service is nice, although not that on the high end at all..."}
{"text":"Went here for an anniversary with my girlfriend. It was a pretty fancy place -- ambiance and decor were lovely, very romantic.   I had the tortellini; girlfriend had the fettuccine. Both dishes were yummy. I can see why some people have said that the tortellini is overly salty but I didn't mind it so much until the end of my meal. Portion sizes weren't huge, but definitely bigger than expected for somewhere nice. I had the tiramisu for dessert, which was fine but not great. Girlfriend really enjoyed the creme brulee.   One star off because while our server was kind and attentive, my problem with the service was with the greeters. It had been raining out and we forgot an umbrella and arrived a bit wet. Someone offered me an extra napkin to dry off, but with the most condescending tone and it totally threw off my experience immediately. We had the money to pay and tip for our meal and I did not appreciate being made to feel like we didn't belong there. Probably wouldn't come back for this reason."}
{"text":"I loved everything about Donatello's. Our server had a thick Italian accent and was very knowledgeable of the menu and what would suit our pallet for the evening. The restaurant looks like an renovated house so it gave off a very cutesy vibe. The evening weather permitted us to sit outside on the patio and that only enhanced our dining experience. I got the dish that resembled chicken parmesan (that's not what they call it though) and the rest of my group ordered the spaghetti 2000. Thumbs up all around the table and we had about 8 people with us. I thought the prices here were very reasonable too. So let's recap, great food, great service, great environment, reasonably priced... that's the definition of a 5 star rating right? I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in town. Good job Donatello's!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. To preface, I went with my mother and we are both Italian and come from a family that is very picky when it comes to Italian food. So it really does say something about an Italian restaurant when we are impressed with it.   Great service. Our waitress was very personable and thoughtful. Sat on the top porch--great atmosphere being up in the lit trees at nighttime.   The menu may seem a little bare, but their specials are where it's at.   For appetizer we got the eggplant special, very good. Sauce was extremely flavorful and the eggplant was cooked perfectly.   I ordered the squash ravioli special and my mom had the chicken asparagus penne special. Both were to die for (ravioli was my favorite of the two--great flavor). Too full for dessert, but the menu looked great.   The price was great for what we ordered. We were expecting much higher. ~$40 each with drinks."}
{"text":"From beginning to end a wonderful dining experience. The service was expert and unobtrusive, very attentive with several servers assigned to each table. The ceasar salad was very credible, better by far than most, followed next by one of the best Spaghetti Pescatore's I've had. The dish had mussels, manila clams, shrimp, calamari and scallops; there was no shortage of good quality fresh seafood. A very light tomato based sauce reduced with a seafood stock dressed the perfectly cooked aldenti pasta. A good quality Red Velvet cake is very hard to fine has been my experience not at Donatello there's is one for the ages. The restaurant has it all together, you will find that menu items are made fresh to order  so expect wait times to be longer but well worth the delay."}
{"text":"Food was really tasty and fresh. We enjoyed our meal. The restaurant is definitely more romantic than we were hoping for (as we were traveling with our family and infant? Service was a little slow, but wait staff is friendly. Overall I would recommend this restaurant for their food!"}
{"text":"First visit to Toronto and searched on yelp which restaurant should go to for romantic dinner and yelp suggested here. We made a reservation on yelp. The owner seated us to the table and also the waiters were so nice. We request for our anniversary but they didn't give any complimentary anything .. but food was good and tasty. I ordered Zuppa with all seafood and tomato sauce. If you like seafood I recommend this dish."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food - I had the Caesar salad to start, the gnocchi in rose sauce (excellent) and the tiramisu for desert.  The service was friendly, although the main waiter allowed a younger waiter to serve us the meals and he kept messing up our orders.  The food got there, it was just a matter of figuring out who had which meal.  Overall, it was a very nice evening."}
{"text":"We got there after driving in from Montreal. Our hotel concierge recommended the restaurant and she was spot on. Great atmosphere, wonderful people, fantastic food. My wife had the lobster pasta special which she said was one of her best Italian meals ever. I had the crab ravioli and it was very tasty as well. Our waiter William was very engaging and helped make the meal a real treat. Definitely recommend this fine restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Seem to come to this place once every couple of months but never got around to reviewing it. Elm street is a quaint street in the busy hustle and bustle of the area. Donatello serves up great dishes - it isn't my favorite Italian restaurant in Toronto but it always serves up consistently tasty dishes so it works well for work dinners, etc...   I think the best feature of this restaurant is the 2nd floor patio outside in the summer. It is an absolutely superb setting for a summer evening glass of wine."}
{"text":"Not the best sea food experience for a restaurant like this. Shrimp for the entrance very small, over cooked and with lots of shell still on. I do way better at home my garlic butter sauce.  Very disappointing   For the main, better shrimp size but the scallops ..... Nothing spectacular.  The sauce  had a film on, comparable to a gravy with cornstarch that gets cold. And the presentation.... Half plate with pasta (that was good) and the other half with the sea food sauce getting in to the pasta.... I bet the chef was not in that day !  Not the best experience for me. Perhaps I should have tried anything else but seafood, but no way to have such a poor experience for the price, that I don't accept."}
{"text":"I'm not from Toronto but decided to eat here while on a visit because of the good overall rating. I probably should have read some reviews.   It took about 20 minutes for the waiter to get our order and another 30 minutes for our food. Nonetheless, I ordered a lobster pasta, their special. I ended up getting a seafood pasta with shrimp, clams, and calamari instead of the lobster pasta I ordered because they apparently ran out... There were about 5 clams but 10 shells and the shrimp was overcooked; overall very mediocre and the seafood not very fresh. There were also pieces of broken clam shells in my pasta. But I do admit, the rosé was great and the calamari was okay.   The ambiance was pleasant but the service wasn't too great. The waiter rarely visited our table, and was unfriendly, a bit pushy, and quite pretentious. (I wasn't poorly dressed or rude). I had a chance to talk to the other waiter as he passed by our table, and he was sweet.   Out came the bill and I was charged the price of the lobster pasta. Not super excited about it but understandable. What made me upset was the added 20% \"suggested\" yet mandatory gratuity. I paid a lobster pasta price for no lobster and paid the waiter I barely saw a hefty tip. Despite paying the tip, the waiter seemed literally angry he didn't get more. Extremely unprofessional and rude.   1/5 because I would not recommend this place to friends. The rosé doesn't make up for everything else."}
{"text":"Disappointing. It was recommended by a colleague but it was unimpressive. The service was fine but the food was not good. I had the veal piccata but it was too sweet to be piccata, closer to veal Marsala. Entree arrived about 10 minutes after I ordered, and it was a busy night, which suggests it was pre-prepared and they just put the veal on a plate put \"piccata\" sauce it and tossed it in the microwave. It came out lukewarm. As I said, unimpressive."}
{"text":"2.5 but rounding down to 2  Restaurant was very nice. We were seated upstairs beside a large party celebrating a birthday. I feel like we were a distant second in terms of priority. Our waiter was not very attentive at all. He decided against writing down our orders and of course, he forgot one of our entrées! After apologizing by saying \"my bad\" our waiter ran down and had the entrée which came approximately 10 minutes later. This really delayed the dinner as the remainder of the party felt it would be rude to begin eating if everyone didn't have their food. Also, our waters were nearly always empty and we asked a minimum of 5 times for bread.   The food was good however some aspects were underwhelming. The shrimp cocktail was something I could have picked up from a grocery store. 5 pieces of shrimp and a shot glass full of cocktail sauce does not warrant $10. Also, it should be known that the prices on the website are inconsistent with the prices in the restaurant. For example, the site says the chicken entrée is $20 whereas in the restaurant it is nearly $25.   The entrées are good, however would not return in the basis of service, or lack there of, as well as value.   Chris"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! From the cozy decor, to the well-dressed and very attentive staff to my favorite part, the outrageously delicious food. I die for the tortellini (minus the mushrooms). I usually order steak at every restaurant, but for donatello I make an exception. I dream about that tortellini!  Also last time I went with my family, they created us an antipasti plate to satisfy everyone!"}
{"text":"We came here on a weeknight after a play for a nice classy italian dinner & this restaurant does not disappoint.  The service is excellent & our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  Our dinner was divine, delicious & can't say enough to great things about it!"}
{"text":"This is one of a very few \"Italian restaurants\" which is actually an Italian restaurant. It is very authentic in everything - people, food, ambient.  Pricey? Oh yes, but that's totally justified. I loved the service, quality of food, and most importantly the atmosphere of the place. I have a bunch of friends either from Italy or Italian heritage, and would not hesitate a second inviting them to Donatello.  The only downside preventing five stars is the portion size - could have been significantly bigger. Otherwise - a great place to go for a romantic dinner, in my opinion. How happened I've always been there with my co-workers only... :-)"}
