{"text":"I had the Yafo shawarma chicken salad and the babaganoush, which in general I like better than hummus.  The food overall is decent.  The shawarma chicken salad was pretty good but not exceptional.  The naan was a little doughy and the babaganoush had burnt eggplant-  at first I thought the bread had a burnt spot but I consistently tasted burnt food and checked the bread and realized it was the spread not bread.  I understand trying to be thrifty as a business but I wouldn't serve it to my friends"}
{"text":"My first few times were a bit stressful - I came during dinner rush and the line made me rethink my choice, but I was determined. Then came ordering - I'm familiar with the cuisine, but not fluent. I watched in awe as those who went before me confidently pointed and picked and colluded on off-menu items.... I ordered two dinners and one of pretty much every mezze they had. I was taking it home and could sample to my hearts delight. My food lasted me four meals... Probably should have stretched to six. There was not one thing I did not like. The trick to ordering is to promise yourself you will be back. Don't settle on your favorite too quickly. Keep sampling the menu. You'll find your favorites and you'll rotate those, too. The food is of amazing quality. I allow myself to be mesmerized by the Laffah Crew. Their movements are the zen you need right before you order. Don't be rushed... set the pace for yourself. Ask questions. Sample. Don't let that loooooong line behind you worry you one bit. Everyone is happy at Yafo because they are about to eat an amazing meal. Also try the Cucumber Lime Mint elixir."}
{"text":"We had high expectations and were not disappointed! I got a kafta bowl & the BF got a shawarma wrap. Everything was super fresh & tasty! We'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Miserable. So slow. Stood in line over 30 minutes while only one person prepared orders. Food ok but not worth the wait"}
{"text":"Go here almost every week. Very good food, authentic taste and full of flavor. Get the chicken shawarma wrap or bowl.... love the bread too with hummus or tsatziki to dip... good value too.."}
{"text":"Great fresh food! Enjoyed the Yafo Schwarma. Excellent hummus as well.  Clean and casual atmosphere. Meal was about $12 with a decent portion."}
{"text":"Really liked the concept. Fresh ingredients, options to customize your own meal and availability of vegan, vegetarian and gluten free items make this place stand out."}
{"text":"We went for the first time today for a quick birthday lunch for my husband who loves Greek food. Yafo was highly recommended to us by a friend who is a chef so we take her recommendations seriously. We both got chicken and rice bowls with tabouleh and tomatoes and cucumbers. The flavors were incredible. I could eat it every day I think. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food, worth the wait! The grain bowl is my go to- tatziki, white rice, with chicken and a side of laffah. My only complaint is the line moves rather slowly, so I usually avoid the place at peak lunch hours."}
{"text":"So impressed by the freshness and quality of the food here!  Yafo has made my day :) this is my favorite Mediterranean food now! Thumbs up for the quality and price you pay.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"We called at 8:30pm (the restaurant closes at 9pm) to order some takeout. We were really excited to try this place. The lady who answered the phone told my husband that they \"were not staffed to take orders over the phone at the time\"....What???? You answered the phone but can't write down an order? So, we never got a chance to eat here and I am already turned off."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Yafo, and was not disappointed! Great food, so delicious. Really easy to order, and everything was fresh. I ordered a Falafel Laffah Wrap, with tzatziki instead of hummus- so good- with a side of potatoes- also so good!   My 2 complaints are that the portions are a little on the small side for the price, and there is not enough seating- we ended up sitting outside when the temperature was in the mid 30s (not fun). But apart from that Yafo is great!"}
{"text":"Grain bowl trend continues! Love the med spin on he trend. Quick spot to fulfill my taboulah cravings. Food is fresh, large portions. Lasts me 2 meals."}
{"text":"I Initially liked this place. Last time. I was here I sat at a table while my buddy ordered our food. Manager tells me that I unable to sit until I have a plate to bring to the table. I WILL NOT SPEND MONEY HERE AGAIN!!! This is freakin Charlotte, NOT LA, NOT NY!!! What happens if I get my order and there are no tables!!???"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time on a Sunday after church after hearing a segment on this new restaurant on the radio earlier this week.  Yafo is a great option for fast, fresh, and tasty food.  There is tons of variety on the menu, which is one of the beauties of this type of cuisine.  We wanted to taste everything!  However, the variety, can also be very confusing.  It is set up similar to the Mexican \"fast food\" chains like Chipotle and Qdoba - you make your selections (hummus bowl, salad, wrap, etc.) at the counter and move along down the line choosing toppings, accompaniments, proteins, sides, etc.  There is a menu posted above that you can reference, in addition to a chalk board listing the day's \"mezzes.\"  The only thing is, if it's your first time there, it can be overwhelming to know what is what - what you're allowed to put on what, what you're exactly getting with what you ordered, or what is an uncharge and what isn't.  We didn't want to hold up the line too much by asking too many questions so we ordered what looked good and was surprised by the uncharges on some of our items that we weren't clear would be upcharges. Once we sat down, we grabbed one of their printed menus to take a closer look and better understand how it all works which was somewhat helpful...I'm thinking they may have a few kinks to iron out in this system to maybe simplify things or make it clearer what goes with what or how to build your particular hummus bowl/salad/wrap.  I definitely wouldn't want to see it get over simplified like Chipotle where you only have X-number of choices, but some clarification would definitely be helpful.    Overall, the food was tasty and again, there's a great variety to choose from.  As for authenticity - I would say the proteins in particular are not your typical Middle Eastern style.  The \"beef kofta\" is more like a meatball in a red tomato sauce.  Tasty for sure, but not what you'd expect for kofta.  The lamb is more like pulled pork in texture, which is disappointing when you see the beautiful roast on the spit in the kitchen.  But again, it tasted good.    We would definitely visit again, especially now that we understand the menu a little better."}
{"text":"I went to YAFO for the first time after several people recommend it to me. I was unsure of how to order and what sides/add-ons I was able to choose with my meal. I told the woman making my order that it was my first time there and wasn't sure what to get....SHE WAS VERY UNHELPFUL!! she did not make any recommendations or help guide me as to what were sides vs toppings, and what the most popular choices are. I wasn't sure of some of the foods were- he also gave me no explanation. The woman in line next to me was more helpful! Thank goodness for her-I wouldn't have been able to pick something. I got the falafel , it was very good. However I originally wanted a him as bowl but couldn't decide if I should build my own or get one they already had.... Because like I said the woman making my Oder was no help."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in clt, better than any sit down restaurants. Luckily we went there 5 min before the queues were going all over the place. Falafel was amazing."}
{"text":"This place is great! Good tasting food. Clean place and very nice customer service from all. We did take out of the shwarma bowl and wrap, along with sides of falafel and brussel sprouts with tabouleh. Everything was delicious! Definitely going back. Didn't do all stars because they have an outdoor patio that doesn't allow pets, and the doors that lead out to the street were locked on my visit and had to figure out if there was another entrance which can be confusing for less patient people in search of a falafel craving."}
{"text":"First time for my wife and me to visit Yafo and it lived up to all the reviews.  The staff was friendly and patient with us \"first timers\" figuring out the process.  The food was exceptional (she had a make your own hummus bowl and I had a make your own grain bowl).  We could not resist the brussel sprouts after reading several reviews and we were not disappointed (actually they were outstanding!).  The servings are quite large (ate our fill and had enough left over for dinner the next night).    You cannot go wrong - fresh, healthy food with a friendly service.  Perhaps my only complaint - because this place is so good, it gets crowded - not an issue for the line as it moves fast, but not a lot of places to sit down and eat, so be willing to get it to go.  Tastes just as good at home as it does in the restaurant.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my son, his girlfriend and her son. Terrific food! They aren't skimpy on the portions and the food I had was so delicious. Lots of choices to choose from. Would have preferred sit down style ordering, but the food was terrific and a great family experience."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant addition!  Everything looked great and fresh.  Didn't know what half of the sides were, but they all looked great.  I had a chicken wrap with a side of hummus. Everything tasted great.  Place was clean and employees were on top of it. I look forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"We had lunch here almost two weeks ago, and I am still dreaming about it! Everything I ate was incredibly fresh, and the flavors and textures of the food compliment each other beautifully. I loved the variety and abundance of vegetarian options and the ability to see most of the food right in front of you as you decide what to put in your order. The staff were friendly and made great recommendations. If I lived in Charlotte, I would eat here on a weekly basis!"}
{"text":"Yafo is one of my favorite places in Charlotte to eat.  It is absolutely amazing.  The one thing this establishment lacks is consistent customer service.  For that, it is 3 stars and not 5.  I feel that if you have a product that is on the pricier range, you should probably have employees that want to sell it to you.    I feel the employees just don't want to be here, and they certainly don't want to be making your lunch.  I have had groans, eye rolls, and flat out refusal to make a late order request.  The menu can be intimidating, and for this reason, the order process doesn't always go as smoothly as possible.  The employees seem to forget this.   I seem to always feel like I am doing something wrong here.    Having said that, the food is simply insanely good, so there is no way in hell I will make this deter me from enjoying it.   It kind of reminds me of the \"Soup Nazi\" episode of Seinfeld, and there will always be soup for me."}
{"text":"Yafo is amazing! Every time I'm in town, I always go to Yafo. All of the mains and sides are delicious. I highly recommend Yafo!"}
{"text":"The following review if written by a 9 year old who loves restaurants and going out to eat with her family. Yafo is one of my favorite places in town. I love going there whenever we can. They have great rice (My favorite food there) and awesome potatoes, too! I love the chicken, and always enjoy my free cookie ( I would recommend snickerdoodle). They have pretty good seating. Yafo is kid friendly and everyone in my family loves it. I also like the macaroni, but prefer the chicken and rice bowl. I would recommend Yafo to anyone looking for a good place to eat. The lines aren't to long, and I think it's good how you immediately get your food (Unlike other restaurants where you have to wait). So, everyone, get in the car and head to Yafo Kitchen!"}
{"text":"A great concept for fresh, healthy and fast food.   You order at the counter.  They have signature grain bowls and salad bowls, delicious wraps, or you can build your own meal by selecting as salad, bowl or wrap, then you pick your sauce, select your toppings, pick a protein which include chicken, falafel, beef, lamb and then you add the dressing.   They have a wonderful choice of vegetables and hummus.   It's great for the gluten-free, vegetarians and vegans.  Definitely a fun place to eat."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  The staff behind the counter are always friendly and even when the restaurant is busy the constant flow of people going in and out allows you to always find a table.  The hummus is amazing, as well as their laffah bread, which is made right behind the counter.  Their unique drinks include Cucumber Mint Lime tea and Watermelon Mint tea I believe, each of which are great.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the casual dining scene in Charlotte.   I would thoroughly recommend!  The food is delicious and very healthy.  I've only been here twice but I want to come back and try everything!  So much to pick from.  I've had the Shawarma Chicken wrap and the felafel wrap...both were great.  Both are wrapped in fresh Laffah bread (sort of like naan) which they make right in front of you when in line.  The wraps comes with a mezze side.  Both times I got the Brussels sprouts with dates as I side because it was amazing!  My friend had the build-your-own bowl which he loved.  Food is great quality but a bit pricey for casual.  It's sort of set up like a Chipotle when you get in line and select your food.  The decor and ambience is much nicer and they do serve wine and beer.  I love the decor...modern wood, pendant lights, bright green accent chairs.  The plates are very cool...white distressed metal.    It's always crowded, so on the down-side the line can be long and sometimes it is hard to find a table.   Hope they open more locations.   This is a winner!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing! I had a party for 27 people last weekend out on the patio.  The staff was so helpful and friendly in both planning the party and executing the party. And the guests absolutely raved about the food. The chef created a family-style eating menu where we got to try almost everything on the menu and it was perfection! I've been twice since then and probably will go many more times. Keep up the great work, YAFO!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to its hype. Everything was fresh and flavorful! There was not a thing on my plate that didn't taste good. I got the create your own grain bowl with chicken and all sorts of toppings. And it's so much food! I also got the brownie cookie bar for dessert--amazing too! The manager was kind enough to walk around and chat with the guests. This place was excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is highly addictive. Just tried it last night and I was so impressed with the quality and flavor of the food. It's a chipotle style line where you select what type of entree you want then add your toppings as you go down the line. I added pretty much anything that looked familiar and mannnnn. It was delicious. Also, get the Brussel sprouts as a side and baklava for dessert. Both crazy good. Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Better than CAVA I'd argue. More options and tastier options, too. I came one night very late right before closing and the food still tasted great. Can't imagine how good it'd be even more fresh earlier in the day. Another thing I noticed was how much food they'd give you. Normally, in places like this, where you order down the line, they serve you tiny little scoops of each thing. But here they just pour it on (not excessive) but a good amount, even if your protein choice. Kind of appreciated this."}
{"text":"Oh my, so good. This place is set up like chipotle but with mediteranean street food instead of overpriced tacos. Their menu online is very helpful for you to browse before showing up. I got the Build Your Own Bowl with Chicken Shawarma over 1/2 hummus and 1/2 salad with babaganoush spread topped with tabbouleh, pickled cucumbers, sumac onions and various other delicious toppings. Side of Laffah bread which is basically like a flat bread. Some schug sauce which is a yummy oily jalapeno cilantro sauce. Their limeade was good and so was the brownie cookie hybrid they had at the dessert pile. The line was a little long but it moves pretty fast. Prepare to have leftovers."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally got a chance to check out Yafo last weekend!  Yafo is located in South Park near Earth Fare. We were able to snag street parking in front...score!  When we first entered, I will admit that I was extremely confused. The menu is not laid out super user friendly. Fortunately, I had done my Yelp research and knew a bit about the menu. I ordered the build your own bowl and the guy making my bowl convinced my husband to get the special of the day (Side Note: I really wish the guy convincing my husband to sway his order would have explained the special a bit better cause it was fried (and we arent really fried food people) and took about 10 minutes longer to cook cause it was made to order....which is normally fine but we were in a rush). For my bowl, I went half hummus and half salad with half chicken half falafel. The falafel portion was pretty small but good. The chicken was delicious. The star of the bowl was definitely the hummus. We piled it on with a ton of extra stuff that I really don't know what it was but it was all tasty. Huge bowl that was enough for both of us. The special came with two sides. We got the brussel sprouts and mac n cheese. The sprouts were fantastic!! Ended up enjoying the fried chicken (it had some pesto layer in between the fried and the chicken that was super good). Just wasn't what we expected. The laffa was perfection.   I am excited to go back to Yafo simply so I know what I am doing when I go there. I think the confusion lies within the odd layout (cue random door that was locked so we had to walk around to get in), little help from the staff as a stare with a confused look in my eye, and food that is a bit unknown/unusual. At the end of the day, we had enough food for two meals and it was all really delicious! My suggestion is to go, pile in whatever you think you may like, and enjoy cause all the food was obviously super fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Love the half hummus/half salad bowl with all the toppings, olives, cucumbers, feta, cabbage, tabouli etc. Delicious, healthy and so fresh!"}
{"text":"I always get the hummus bowl with 1/2 rice and 1/2 hummus to make it less hummus-y if that's even a thing. It's really good especially with the shawarma chicken which can have a little bit too much oil and the rice soaks it up... what else is good? Everything... but the mezzes (side dishes) are all awesome.. salads are amazing.. you can get everything here and be happy!"}
{"text":"This place is one of a kind and everything I've ever had has been superb!  The staff and management also take time to stop by each table thank you for coming in and ask what they can improve upon.  Great food and service and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Uh...YUM. My coworker brought back a ton of stuff to try from their recent opening. Everything we had was delicious, with lots of leftovers to bring home and chow down for a few more meals. The hummus and baba ganoush are silky smooth and sooo garlicky, and the tzatziki is nice and thick. The lafah tastes really fresh and handmade with pleasantly varying thickness and a great chew. We also split the sabich which was enjoyable, but I might have liked it better if I'd had it hot - still, even at room temperature the flavors of eggplant, egg and pickled veggies were excellent. The shredded brussels sprout salad seemed a little out of the realm of what I'd expect from mediterranean cuisine (not that I know exactly what to expect!) but it was good too, with big chunks of bleu cheese and walnuts.   Prices seem reasonable, especially if you order a few different things and share with someone else. I'm super excited to go visit on my own and try the falafel and pretty much everything else on the menu. I can see this becoming a new favorite lunch spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Fresh hummus, many vegetable sides, vegetarian options, generous portions, attentive service, music not too loud, comfortable porch for large groups."}
{"text":"Ok, I have been here twice since they opened. The concept is fantastic, but it's pricy and the portions of \"goodies\" are so small. It's too expensive for lunch and too casual for dinner. I really want to love it, but I don't."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Best falafel wraps I have ever had! Everything is so incredibly fresh. The staff was inviting and helpful. They make the dough right in front of you! This place is going to stay busy for a long time if they keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Great place, and with only one change I'd give it 5 stars. Great food and quality ingredients, great value for money, great menu and service. So what's the change? On my visit, the amount of garlic in sauces and vegetables was overwhelming. I eat Mediterranean often, and normally it is not prepared with this much garlic. Otherwise, this place is 5 stars in casual dining."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Fresh ingredients.  Friendly service.  Very lively restaurant that certainly has built a fast following!"}
{"text":"Tried Yafo for the first time today, a Wednesday afternoon. Line was a little long but definitely worth the wait. Food was delicious and fresh. I rate this 5 stars for taste and 4 for price. It was a little pricey for lunch but understandable because of the ingredients. The atmosphere was nice and we were still able to find a table even though it was busy. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is s delicious place for lunch.  I had the lamb grain bowl and cucumber lime drink.  Everything was fresh and tasty. The staff was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night..close to 7:00.  The line was backed up to the front entrance, so very busy.  However they prepare the food for you as you are in line (similar to Chopt or qdoba) and as you finish in the line you have your food (no wait for them to bring it out to you).  Wanted to try the rotisserie chicken, but they were out of all white meat (what??).  So I ordered 3 mezze (sides).  I ordered the falafel, cauliflower and babaghanoush.  Unfortunately, I got the bottom of the barrel (last remains in pan) of the falafel and cauliflower so they weren't as warm as I would have liked. The cauliflower was very good, falafel on par with other Mediterranean joints, but the babaghanoush was a little too thick for my taste..I've definitely had better in Charlotte. The pita was warm and soft, so bonus points for that. It was so crowded that I had to wipe my own table before sitting down, but when asked for a to-go box, was promptly given one.  I think I would go back, since it's close to work, but won't wait in that long of a line again. Maybe it will be less crowded once it's been open a while.  Reasons for only 4 stars:  \"86\" on white meat chicken, luke-warm veggies,  babaghanoush too thick."}
{"text":"I love this place! I think we've been here three or four times already and I always leave happy! The staff are so incredibly sweet and friendly and the place is so clean!  My favorite thing to get is the choose 2 bowl. I usually get the hummus and salad.  Their pita bread is so soft and yummy and everything tastes so fresh and delicious! I also never ever get fountain drinks or anything besides water at restaurants but when I go here, I can't help but to get a fountain drink and do half hibiscus tea and half cucumber drink. Not too sweet and SO refreshing!!! ( Must try!) We got to try their hummus with sautéed mushrooms last time and OH MY! it was SO delicious!   I can't say enough good things about this place! Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"my favorite place to eat. taziki is wonderful. the potatoes are to die for. the laffah is worth the wait. couscous is perfect. anything anyone i've been with loved what they ate. go!"}
{"text":"The best fresh lunch in Charlotte hands down. The mint dressing is so refreshing! Love this place, except for the long lunch time lines."}
{"text":"I had a create your own bowl with half salad half hummus with chicken and veggies. Everything was on point.  The chicken was nicely seasoned and the hummus was great.  This place is packed so seating may get a bit sparse. Also nothing beats chewy ice."}
{"text":"We are major fans of Mama Ricotta's and were delighted to hear of this concept opening.  Our current favorites (Kebab J in Matthews and Jasmine in South Park) weren't enough, Mediterranean is my 2nd favorite and requested meal.  The parking hasn't been a problem on the two weekend days we've gone and every single thing we've ordered has been delicious and fresh (except, the potatoes-just meh and not worth the purchase, didn't even finish them.)  All brussels sides have been incredible (double points for the dates!), hummus is wonderful, yogurt mac and cheese heavenly and between our trips we enjoyed rotisserie chicken, wraps and salads all to our delight.  Here it is 2pm on a Tuesday and I'm counting the minutes until I can go back for dinner."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped here Sunday and it was packed, which was a good sign. Looking at the menu and then the buffet like line we were somewhat confused about what the dishes were. We did not know that Mezzes were side which turned out to be some really good looking veggies lime Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and more. We kept it simple, she had the chicken shawarma over a bed of quinoa and jasmine rice and added more to the bowl such as the baba ghanoush , onions, what looked to be garlic and chopped cilantro. I order the beef kofta shawarma and added everything on the line I could over a bed of Jasmine Rice. We both took our first bites and instantly knew we found a winner to return too. The beef had a great flavor and mixed with the baba ghanoush and all the other additives was an explosion of well blended flavors. The same was said with my girlfriend's chicken shawarma. The staff was friendly and very efficient in clearing trays and trash off tables. We sat outside on a mildly  warm night which made our experience much better. Next time we are there we will definitely try the mezzes and split a shawarma bowl."}
{"text":"Love this place, food and ambiance is amazing. Best Mediterranean food spot ive been to in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I'm a newbie to Mediterranean food so I came in with no idea what anything was. The setup is like Chipotle where you can either build your own custom order or order from the menu. I did a build your own bowl with rice, chickem, tatziki and a ton of other toppings. It's pricier than a chipotle, mine came out at around $11 but it was A TON of food and the quality was excellent. The pita bread is also freshly made and its incredible. My meal was delicious and Im dying to go back. Their sweet tea is also some of the best I've ever had. Im so glad to have found this place!   It was too cold when I went, but they also have an adorable patio with lots of outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! This is hands down the best tzatziki, hummus, and falafel in Charlotte. The wait can be a little long but they just opened and I expect that will improve soon enough. We've been here at least 3 times since they opened and everything we have had is amazing: falafel side, dip trio, Marrakesh lamb grain bowl, chicken shawarma wrap, chicken grain bowl, and chicken salad bowl. The chickpea salad is awesome, and the cilantro jalapeño sauce is a must have. Oh and get extra bread, you'll want it!"}
{"text":"First visit. Will NOT be my last. Marrakesh Lamb was excellent. Went with my team from work. Next time I'm bringing the wife."}
{"text":"Food is extremely fresh and flavorful- have enjoyed everything I have tried- you can't go wrong! Staff is happy to assist if you need some assistance.  In terms of atmosphere- can be loud and  cramped during typical meal rush times- difficult to have a conversation or navigate your way through order line to get to bathroom."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food!  The ordering process definitely needs some refinement.  It felt a little chaotic because the place was busy, and the staff plating the food seemed a bit out of sorts and a little less helpful than I expected.  They would benefit from some signs next to each food item; in theory they shouldn't need them (a lot of fast casual restaurants don't), but the reality is that this type of cuisine is not common to most people in Charlotte so people (including me) just don't know what's what.  The mezzes (sides) are awkwardly in the middle of the line - bowl/wrap/salad, spread, veggies, sides?!, protein, sauce - which doesn't make sense to me, and the meats and sauces are basically out of sight (crammed next to some small beer fridges).  Also desserts are at the front of the line - why?!  Ordering process needs some work but the food is really good!"}
{"text":"Holy moly did Yafo blow me away. It's got a pretty good rep around town but oh MAN did it live up to the hype.  The scene: 1:30pm on a Saturday. The place is PACKED. WE stood in line for about 10 minutes. There are lots of tables, the patio was under construction but it didn't look long term so I'd expect it'll be open again soon. The first person who helped us in line was very friendly, the second didn't give a dang about anything. Alas. I couldn't stop piling things onto my plate. I did half hummus/half salad bowl (I personally think getting a hummus bowl would just be too much hummus). I got falafel, beets, slaw, mediterranean salad, and brussels sprouts on top. Everything looked so good I would have gotten it all if I thought I could eat it all.  The food: It's seriously so fresh. EVERYTHING was good. The brussels were particularly delectable. Really blew me away. The lemon dressing was refreshing. The hummus was great. The not-actually-pita that they give you is gooey and warm and amazing. A vegetarian paradise, for sure.  I will be back to Yafo SOON to try those delicious-looking potatoes and everything else that i didn't yet have. So good."}
{"text":"Looks like Frank S has hit another home run! Yafo is mediterranean \"not quite fast\" street food. It took about 30 minutes to get through the line at 7:30 but it was only their first week in business so they'll probably iron those kinds of kinks.   We tried the hummus bowl, grain bowl, and kids Mac and cheese and shared everything! The Shawarma Grain Bowl was the best, filled with all kinds of fresh and savory flavors combined perfectly. My 9 year old gobbled down the hummus and freshly baked Laffah.   Good place for pre movie meal or workday lunch. Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"I would definitely like this place more if everything was delicious!!! I felt like some of the staples were missing goodness.  It was hit or miss for me! My friend and I ordered the bowl and put whatever we wanted in it.   It's set up like Mo's. You pick what you want in an assembly line, you make it the way you like it. Some of the items they will let you taste if you just ask.   Hit: -Hummus -Wheat grain -Cauliflower -Mixture of tomatoes and cucumber -Cucumber -Cilantro  If you order for a group you can get fried pita chips. I got these during a home tour in plaza midwood. It's so amazing that it's pretty much the only reason I came to this place. The hummus, tomato, & cucumber mix on the chips were to die for!!  I was completely bummed out the pita chips aren't ever on the regular menu.   Miss: -Fries         - Big grainy hunks, seasoned, only warm -Mac n cheese       - fell way below, as a lover.  -Rice      - yuck, it had fennel seeds in it!  -pita     -chewy and not my cup of tea  -some other slop like thing that tasted like vinegar.. Next time I'll tell you the name of it."}
{"text":"Fantastic. The lamb was tasty and the sides were great. The tender Brussels sprouts were a surprising standout! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for falafel and was in the South Park area though I had not previously heard of this place.  We really liked the area and the service was good.  With so many choices and great looking food it was a tough choice.  We arrived shortly after 11:30 and the line moved well, a total of 5 min wait.  My falafel wrap was amazing and the potatoes on the side were very tasty.  The kids chicken and rice bowl was huge and more than enough for my daughter.  We loved the decor though the napkins blended in which took a minute to spot.  Great food, friendly service, and plenty of additional options to try on our next visit!"}
{"text":"This is honestly one of our favorite places to eat! The potions are HUGE, the food is delicious and we leave with full stomachs (which is saying a lot for my hubby and I). To get as much food as we do for less than $40 is incredible! When there's a line the wait is no more than 10 minutes. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with the food here! I literally cannot stop thinking about the cabbage or the cauliflower!  Absolutely delicious, healthy, and so filling!"}
{"text":"Excellent healthy food for reasonable prices! I tried the make your own bowl with romaine, hummus, pickled cucumber, olives, feta, chicken and the tahini vinaigrette. You can have all of this for about $11 with tax. I liked the bread, sampled a taste from my friends' lunch. The bread comes with the chef designed bowls not the make your own bowls. I think the service is great too! It was crowded and they helped us find a table. I look forward to trying the patio when it is fall!  The lamb & hummus is my new fave with schug sauce!"}
{"text":"It saddens me to leave this review today, but after my family's recent (and fourth) visit to Yafo's resulted in a food-borne illness that included chills and severe diarrhea for four of my family members, I felt it was time I shared my experiences eating here. In fact, my husband and two children and I are still trying to recover from whatever we contracted from Yafo's food as I type this; our symptoms of food-borne illness began within 12-48 hours after eating Yafo's, and continued for 4+ days.   If you like Mediterranean food, which we do, you will LOVE the food here. We enjoyed our first meal at Yafo's around 8 months ago and on that occasion, we had a great experience, overall. However, both our second and third meals were ruined by hair in the food, and when I reported this to management, I was not initially believed, which added even more insult to injury considering I had spent nearly $180 on those two meals for my family of six. Additionally, we were offered a very pitiful refund after 3 weeks of back-and-forth discussion for the contaminated (hair) food we purchased on our second and third visits.   Despite being put off with the hair incidents, my family and I decided to give Yafo's another chance at redemption this past week. We went to the restaurant on a weekday evening and spent around $90 in food to go. Unfortunately, this last visit resulted in four family members contracting some sort of food-borne illness that has spanned the past 4-5 days straight. I'm talking cramps, severe diarrhea, intermittent fever, vomiting for one person, and chills. And yes, this is the only food my four family members and I have eaten (together) since the onset of symptoms; the two family members who did not eat the food have been 100% symptom free. I'm submitting a stool sample to my doctor if the illness does not resolve by tomorrow and if so, I will post an update. Bottom line - this illness has been so horrible, my husband and I both had to take off from work, one of our kids also had to stay home from school, and we had to reschedule two appointments.   A couple concerns I noticed while visiting the restaurant this last time: one of the line associates (guy who serves food at the bar as people walk down the line) picked up a couple things off the floor but never changed his gloves; he also served food (touched the serving spoons and bowls, etc.), as food moved down the order line. I also saw a couple guys walk into the food prep area and come back out to serve food without changing gloves. Another staff member left the food aisle to do something in another area of the restaurant (used a soiled white towel to wipe up something and brought the used towel back into the serving line area), and also maintained the same pair of gloves. The young lady who handles the bread always seems to have a clean space so no complaints there.   Staff was friendly on this occasion, but it certainly seems there could very well be some cross-contamination going on given employees were doing multiple things without changing gloves. I truly hope whatever contamination occurred is both discovered and addressed so no one else becomes ill, especially since the food is unique and delicious.   For the above reasons, I'm giving Yafo's a single star. Sadly, our family will not return to this restaurant in the future given how sick the food made us this past week. Foodies beware."}
{"text":"Been dying to try this place and finally got a chance to this weekend!! Yummy!!! Got a half and half, salad and bulgur wheat two proteins because I was being greedy. The eggplant and the beef with pine nuts, with hummus, a variety of toppings including the cucumber/tomato salad, olives, onions, cabbage with toasted almonds and cilantro yogurt sauce. It comes with bread that is soft and warm and so delicious! The whole bowl was such a wonderful collection of flavors and textures, from the beef, wheat, hummus, cabbage etc. Seriously it's a little bowl of food heaven!!  The eggplant is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and absolutely delicious!!! The beef was wonderfully flavored! The best thing is that you can come here and make a whole lot of different combinations and thus have something new each time!  Pet peeve- they have recyclable cups but don't recycle!!! WHY?!!! I took mine home to recycle! Please do that too if you care about the environment and want you kids and grandkids see the beautiful earth that we do!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Yafo Kitchen.  As newbies, we knew going in that this was a \"fast casual\" restaurant, but we were a bit bewildered by the menu and ordering process.  After staring the menuboard for awhile, we finally stepped up to the counter and confessed that this was our first time and we needed a little guidance.  Put simply, imagine a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern version of Chipotle.  It made it easier for me to think of it like that.  We each ordered the bowl and then walked down the line, deciding what ingredients we wanted in it.   They do have pre-designed bowls and entrees, but they cost just as much as building your own, so you may as well get what you want.  I built my own, starting with a combination of rice and bulgar and then topped it with a variety of veggies and flavors, finishing with a \"protein\" of Shawarma chicken.  The combination of flavors was amazing.  I loved every bite, and it was definitely very filling.    As for drinks, they have a soda machine, but they also offer 3 types of juices, which reminded me a bit of the offerings at Viva Chicken (but you can get free refills at Yafo).  I tried the cucumber/lime/mint.  It was delicious.    For a \"fast casual\" restaurant, it's a bit on the high end for pricing, but you do get good quality food, and seemingly lots of it.  We spent $30 on a meal for two.  There's a place on the bill for tipping, which is normally a huge pet peeve of mine.  I didn't mind giving a little extra because the first employee we encountered did a great job of explaining how everything works.  Still...these employees I'm sure aren't getting the standard $2/hour server pay.  They're also not bringing my food TO me.  But I digress...  We got there around 8:30 or so, and they were closing at 9:00 (which seems a bit early).  They were still pretty jam-packed by the time we were leaving, just before 9:00.  Before that, after we sat down to eat, we observed one seemingly disgruntled employee, already turning off the juice machines and getting buckets ready to empty them out.  My partner had already had a grumpy encounter with him when he was trying to get his drink; the employee was standing in front of the drink area blocking everyone's way, not really doing anything at all.  He was also the same employee who grumpily took the plates away from our table.  I said \"thank you,\" but it went without response from Mr. Grumpy Pants.  Look, I'm sorry you're at work, dude, and it's obvious you want to get out of here the way you're closing up shop while there are still a lot of customers in the restaurant, but if you're unhappy with your job, find a new one.    Despite this one employee, everything seemed to run pretty smoothly at Yafo and everyone else seemed happy we were there.  I'm definitely a fan, and we'll be back.    p.s. It looks like Yafo gets its name from a former (ancient) city of west-central Israel on the Mediterranean Sea."}
{"text":"Good choices, the place is big, they have lunch specials sometimes. I've been here about 4 times, it is a good place for lunch, I am not sure if I'm the only one who actually says that the meat is not that great? It has flavor but each time I've eaten here, there is something about the meat that is not exactly what it's supposed to taste like, example: I had the grilled chicken , I could taste a lot more the grease than the flavor, if it wasn't for the veggies I had, it wouldn't have been a good mix. The price is fair for what you are getting though."}
{"text":"The wraps are by far the best item on the menu. You gear a great amount of protein and toppings. Get the Spicy orange Sauce and it will make it perfect. The restaurant itself is located by the South Park Mall and has plenty of seating for everyone. The outdoor seating is quite nice on a cool day but is covered on the really hot ones. Staff is very friendly and the prices are a little bit higher but you get a good quality meal."}
{"text":"Have to downgrade my rating because of the Brussels sprouts. Was there Saturday Sept 23. The sprouts were not soft and tender like usual. In fact, they were so tough, I couldn't finish them. Just horrible!! They went from first place to last in that category."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for an early dinner.Really enjoyed everything we had! Had the beef bowl. Everything in it was very fresh! We also got the mezza plate of five had the macaroni and cheese, beets with goat cheese, brussels sprouts, taziki  and cauliflower. They were all really good I think the standouts were The cauliflower and taziki.  I think the build your own bowl would be great but for a first timer it was a little bit overwhelming will definitely be back to try that. What we got was a ton of food for two people definitely have a lot of leftovers."}
{"text":"Wow! This is something different in the Charlotte area. Husband and I always love getting halal food when we go up to NYC and so when we saw this place we thought we'd give it a try.   Went to the mall and had to drop off an item for a family friend. Her husband and her are both foodies and she remembered we told her we love halal food and would love to try other Mediterranean foods. She bought us two bowls to go from here.   One was hummus with all the pretty color toppings and the other was a rice/lamb bowl. Both were delicious!!   I will be coming back to have it as a sit down meal."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for Charlotte to get a place like this. We lived in Chicago for two years and they had tons of these types of places. The food was great but the line moved entirely way too slowly. We went at 6:45 pm on a Sunday it took us 40 minutes to get through the line. I would have rated this restaurant four stars if it weren't for the excessive wait."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place on Yelp. Been there just once and love it already. I am a heavy meat but flavor is still as important. Everything thing we tried was very fresh and very delicious.   The smooth almost creamy  baga gnoush yielded a smoky and deep flavor. The house made pickled cauliflower balanced spiced and sour notes, a must try. The hummus and tabouleh were so good too.   Do yourself a flavor and try this place."}
{"text":"The food is excellent; I got the Shawarma chicken bowl, which was wonderful.  The chicken was a bit on the dry side, but when mixed with all of the ingredients (including tahini dressing and a terrific tzatziki sauce), it worked.  You can hear people all over the restaurant raving about the food.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that it's painfully slow; the guys behind the counter are not quick, and because there's so many options and unusual items, people ask a LOT of questions. Your selection gets passed down to another 2 or 3 people as they build it and so you have to keep asking/answering questions or specifying your choice. They'll need to iron that out or folks will walk in and leave immediately if there's any kind of a line.  There were maybe 10 people in front of me and it still took almost 15 minutes before I ordered and another 5 before I was finished.  But it was worth it."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD THAT I HAVE HAD IN A VERY LONG TIME! I'm astonished how inexpensive it was for such a big portion. I will definitely make this a weekly thing."}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love.   This place gives you fast friendly service with healthy options. It's an extensive menu but you can make it your own.   I arrived on Saturday morning when they opened. No wait and I got a full run down of how they operate!   I decided to get a BYOB. They didn't have the rice ready so I opted for couscous as my base with tabouli, feta, chick peas, olives and shawarma chicken.   My goodness.   Everything was so good! I loved all the flavors and how things went so well together! Add to that the yummy laffa bread and they have a new fan!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I got the chicken shawarma bowl and it was absolutely delicious.  All of the food tastes so fresh and authentic and the staff is super friendly.  They let you sample the items too if you want to try before you buy. I will definitely be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Wow oh wow! This place is the real deal! So happy to have found this spot via yelp. It is a fast casual meets Mediterranean spot with some great eats and vibes. They have entrees and also build your own options. I opted for the hummus bowl with shredded lamb on top of it.  I chose all the toppings I wanted and added a side of Brussels sprouts! Super delicious and healthy. Perfect for anyone on keto or a low carb diet."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good. I heard rumors about the delicious food from Yafo, but had yet to venture over to southpark to try it. Fortunately we had some from vegetarian friends visit, so we thought that would be a good time to try Yafo since they have a lot of potions for non meat eaters and carnivores alike. Most of us tried the create your own bowl. It is basically Chipotle with mediterranean food, but with way more options. I mean tons of ingredients. Plus they put extra attention to make sure each ingredient is prepared right. Unlike other create your places where you get more variety than quality, you get both at yafo. Prices range from 9-15$ but the portions are quite large. We'll definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Yafo is a food lover's paradise. As a huge fan of anything in bowls, and particularly buddha/power bowls, I knew this would be my spot.   We stopped in on a Saturday evening and there was a great vibe to it. It's been on my bucket list for a while.   Some of my favorite parts: - Build your own bowl (you can get certain toppings, like grains, hummus or tzatziki, vegetables, olives, chickpeas included automatically). It's a great way to try a little bit of everything! There is an upcharge for other toppings, such as beets, avocados, cheeses, falafels, and other meats/proteins. - They are very generous with portion sizes - They have some fantastic dressing combo's. My favorites were the mint vinaigrette and the tahini.  - Everyone is friendly, tables are clean, service is great  My only complaint would be the location of the bathroom. It is extremely inconvenient to get to, and difficult to navigate around the ordering line to walk to the bathroom, which is in the far back corner of the restaurant.   Everything else was fantastic and the service was top notch. We had two managers come check on us to ensure we had everything we needed and someone took our tray away immediately after sitting."}
{"text":"I love Yafo. It is a little overpriced though. But the portions are large. I always have some to take home for later. Nice covered outdoor patio and nice indoor space. Connor was very helpful last time I was there."}
{"text":"First time here.  I built my own bowl getting salad, rice, humus and the lamb.  Everything was great.  Seems a little on the pricey side, but it is all fresh ingredients as far as I can tell.  Place is clean and the staff friendly and helpful.  Music is also good.  Would recommend this place to anyone who likes Mediterranean."}
{"text":"This is like a Mediterranean food Chipotle.  It was delicious.  Food was fresh and you get to create your own masterpiece.  The macaroni and cheese does not look the best but it tastes amazing. It is a must try!  I ate half of my husbands since I did not order it.  The bread is made fresh and is yummy."}
{"text":"Food is really good but they need to have a bathroom INSIDE the restaurant which is annoying not to have."}
{"text":"Coming from the DC/VA metro area to Charlotte ever so often you get that super bad hankering and craving for some solid Medi food.  The possibilities are endless up there with fast casual restaurants similar to Yafo, and I was SO THRILLED to finally fill a void when my body screams for all-of-the-veggies plus chicken-shawarma.  The line here is usually massive so you definitely have to time it right. Lots of vegan/vegetarian/gluten free options so it's a great casual spot to hit up with people who have dietary restrictions.  Plus, you'll never ever leave hungry."}
{"text":"Portions are really large  A lot of options on the menu  Look at menu online before you go in as it can be a bit overwhelming the first time  You may want to consider splitting a meal   With all of that said - the food was very fresh and tasted great.    You can watch the bread being made.   A lot of salad options.  The specialty teas are a bit pricey but healthy  and very good.   The dessert where very good."}
{"text":"this place has been a staple for the work team and I didn't understand why people made the drive that far to go get it. but now I've had it, wow, this is quite the experience. build your own if you want a lot of food, but otherwise everything they make is delicious. I did my build your own hummus bowl and it was probably enough for two meals. everything looked and tasted delicious. it's certainly not a Michelin-starred meal, but it's great for under $15 lunches. 5/7 would come back again"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and got two different things. The first time I got a wrap, but trip #2 I opted for the hummus bowl and was not disappointed. Two massive scoops of hummus, and lots of options for add-ins. We opted for fresh tomatoes, roasted red peppers, purple cabbage, chick peas, and a little quinoa. The bowl was big enough to split, unless you're starving.   The staff behind the counter was great and despite a line at lunch time, they were able to answer any questions we had and gave great suggestions.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"It was just okay wish I had the 5 star experiences like the others. There was only young man who greeted us warmly. The others seemed robotic on a Sunday afternoom. The chicken was lacking  flavor,but the Tzatziki was very tasty. Balanced out and the Brussels  sprouts and mac and cheese shells were also good. Will probably come back and try one of the bowls."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great food, options, and service. The staff is really friendly and provides great service. They periodically walked by and asked how everything was and cleared any empty dishes or trays. I got the Yafo grain bowl and it was HUGE.  I could have eaten off of it at least 2 or 3 times, but it was so good I stuffed myself. I will be back to try more things!"}
{"text":"Food is solid; some of the best Mediterranean food in the area. I also loved the look and feel of the restaurant. Portions are very generous and they use high quality ingredients. There are so many great options. I had the hummus bowl with chicken shawarma; so good. I really liked how the made the tabouli. It was perfect. My husband had the chicken shawarma bowl. We got a side of falafel and our friends got a trio of babaganoush, hummus and tzatziki. The hummus and tzatziki were my personal favorites. The house made lafah bread is delicious. The falafel is flavorful and not dry. Topping combinations are endless. Don't forget to try the green, hot sauce! This will definitely be a place we will frequent. I'm already thinking about what I'll get next time!"}
{"text":"Yafo is my literal definition of happiness and I am proud to admit I live here once a week. It is a bit overwhelming, but after 10+ visits, I think I have it down. Here we go!  1. Choose your base (salad, grain, hummus, tzatziki, baba ganoush or half and half). I always get the hummus bowl and ask for a bit of tzatziki and baba ganoush on top. Also, yes to the olive oil and paprika that they drizzle on top of the hummus! 2. Choose your toppings. I get the onions, beets, quinoa salads (there is one that has cranberries and it is MAGICAL - \"lemon and cranberry quinoa salad\"), cauliflower rice tabbouleh, purple cabbage slaw and cucumber/tomato salad. 3. Choose your protein. I usually skip the protein because my bowl is so delicious on its own! Yafo makes me believe I can be a vegetarian.  4. Choose your sides. I get mac and cheese, brussel sprouts and the potatoes on top. Lifehack: if you get the side items on top, they're $1 instead of $3. I do recall a visit where I literally put every single side on top (got a little too overzealous #noregrets). 5. Choose your sauces. My favorites are the cilantro jalapeno sauce, spicy reg schug (habenero.. beware!), garlic sauce and lemon tahini. The cilantro yogurt is also yummy!  Yafo offers a happy pick me up and makes me feel like I'm being healthy. Second lifehack: of you put make and cheese on a hummus bowl, it becomes healthy. Who knew?"}
{"text":"I was wanting to find a vegetarian friendly restaurant for me and my friend (the pescatarian). The pictures on yelp really made me want to try Yafo. We both did the build your own. I got the rice with chickpea cabbage and tomato and then lamb for my protein. The presentation of the bowl was amazing and everything was super fresh. I really appreciated how honest the employees were when making recommendations. I also got a side of garlic potatoes because I can eat potatoes all day every day. The cost of my meal was $20 which is pricy but the food was good and the portion sizes were big."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Mediterranean and this place popped up on yelp. It was absolutely amazing! I loved the option to make your own bowl/wrap and add anything and everything you want to it. We tried the beef Kofta, the pulled lamb and the chicken and I could not tell you which was my favorite, they were all delicious. I am not from this area but if i am ever passing by again, I will definitely be eating here."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite fast/casual restaurant in Charlotte! Their food is so delicious and there are plenty of vegan options. The laffa (pita bread) is awesome and the brussel sprouts are a standout. I came here right after they opened and had great service but figured, like many businesses, their service would decline over time. I can happily say the service is still on point! Super friendly and helpful employees checked on me multiple times after I sat down to eat. I was genuinely smiling to myself while I dined alone. I'm a little rusty writing yelp reviews but I knew I would be doing a great disservice if I didn't share how fantastic this place is. Well done Yafo!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, unique, little spot. My husband and I were at South Park mall the other day, and were craving something fresh that he food court just couldn't offer. I had heard about this place from a few friends, and decided to try it out. I'm so glad I did!   Yafo has this amazing quality that makes the food filling without being too heavy. I love the idea that you can build your own plate! This makes it a great spot to take everyone--there will be something on the menu every person will like.   Great flavor, unique combinations, good location.   My only gripe is that it's a little pricey for a \"fast food\" restaurant. And their flavored water was a little bland and blah. But honestly, those aren't good reasons to stay away! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is so friggin popular, try to go during off hours if you can. Their proportions are a great value abs their bowls are filled to the brim.  My favorite is the pulled lamb on a half and half bowl with lots of hummus.  The line can be a bit slow, they still have some operational things to figure out but the food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The food is so fresh and flavorful. I order a hummus bowl and love the lamb. The macaroni and cheese is to die for as well."}
{"text":"I went here for the 1st time last week and while the food was good, I think the method for ordering could use some refinement. There aren't any signs for any of their items so I decided to get one of their predefined bowls to make it easy on myself.   I tell the 1st worker that I want the Kafo Schwarma bowl and the order starts. Then I have to tell the next person the same thing. Once I get to the 3rd person, I get asked about my addons. I ask them what each one is and tell them I would like some falafel. I don't realize til after I pay that there was no chicken and I was charged a build your own with falafel.   While I have no problem with that and I wasn't incorrectly charged, I feel that the process could be just a bit better since I might as well just make my own bowl every time if it's going to get lost in translation. Besides that, the food was good and fresh so I'll still give them another shot."}
{"text":"Casual dining with a lot of healthy options. The food was tasty, especially the Yafo wrap. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"So, so good. As a vegetarian, I love it. I wish I could afford to eat at Yafo every day. Everything on the menu is top notch. I especially love the jalapeño oil blend they serve on the side. Best falafel ever. Get the cucumber drink and a side of their mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"What a delicious restaurant! They serve clean food, fresh made juices, and tasty desserts. The cuisine is Mediterranean and fresh. They currently have a location in Southpark but are building a new location on Central Ave in Plaza Midwood. I recommend building a bowl so you can try new things!   Follow me at: jodieats_  Photo credit: Tarra Dahlke"}
{"text":"I loved it! It is a \"fast healthy food\" place. You create your own plate, and if you don't mind paying a little extra, ypu can have all the items in the menu in the same bowl.  The restaurant is located in a very nice area, surrounded by many stores and other restaurants.  I had a couscous bowl with hummus, falafel and basically all the veggies they had, and it was very good and fulfilling. All the ingredients were very fresh, and the hummus was full of flavor.  Did I mention the awesome bread???? You will want more than one. It is freshly baked the bread in house so you get it warm, (you can actually see the process through the window) and it is the perfect side for the bowls, and I am guessing that the wraps are amazing too. It is buttery, but not greasy...  They also offer different healthy teas.  I really enjoyed this place. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Through mutual friends, I was able to give this new restaurant a try just days before opening to the public. Upon entering, you are welcomed by a comfortable seating area adjacent to a walk through, counter ordering system, similar to a Chipotle. Being unfamiliar with Mediterranean delicacies, my questions were welcomed and answered kindly by the first employee in the ordering chain. Options ranged from bowls to wraps to rotisserie chicken with sides called \"mezzes\". I chose a very Americanized meal with 1/4 rotisserie chicken, seasoned rice, and Mac and cheese; of note, the Mac and cheese was created with a slightly different flavor which made the cheese flavor pop even more. Other options that come to mind were couscous, potatoes, and many other specialty side items. Lamb and steak were also other main meat choices. My colleagues selected very traditional dishes, all of which looked very appealing. The variety of colors seem to make the order aesthetically pleasing, yet even more tasty. At the end of the line, Nutella balls await to top off the meal as well as a choice of bread for the table. Beverage options included beer, sodas, or a selection of organic/herbal teas.  This restaurant is a great option to become a weekday staple or a new flavorful adventure. While a specialty restaurant, there's something here for the whole family."}
{"text":"We randomly happen to find this place thru yelp and man...what a find!!!   Being a vegetarian, I had numerous options and my food tasted fresh!! Definitely a place I'll be going to again and again!!   Finally a good falafel place in town!!"}
{"text":"I have been dying to come here and finally got the chance to because I live so far. I always see pictures of full bowls of fresh food on social media from this place. You order in the front and take it back to your table, much like Chipotle. I got the Half and Half. Originally, I had asked for half grain and half salad but he ended up giving me half salad and half hummus. After being passed to the next lady, I told her the mix-up and she was very snarky about it. She might have been stressed or whatnot, so I just told her it's fine so I can leave her alone and move on. I got the Cauliflower and Tomato Salad as one of my toppings.   I love the pita bread they give you. You can see someone making it in the window and it's so fluffy and chewy, I love it. I mixed my bowl and put it into some pita bread to make mini tacos. Super delish!The Cauliflower and Tomato salad was good, but I could barely make out the cauliflower. I got chicken, which was seasoned very well and not dry. I want more cheese like feta on it because eventually everything in your bowl turns to mush with the amount of sauce and everything tastes the same. Nonetheless, the veggies are very vibrant and fresh! I would love to come back again when I am in the Southpark area."}
{"text":"Great place !   Finally was able to try Yafo and I was not disappointed. I did the build your own and chose things based off other Yelp reviews. The menu seems overwhelming at first but it's really not and the staff is very knowledgable and will help you choose toppings etc or explain how the menu works.   All the ingredients were extremely fresh and flavorful. The chicken was so so good as well. I would suggest trying their teas because they are great (the green mint one was my favorite) The portions are huge so you can def make two meals out of it if you need to!   I also noticed the employee wiping down the tables was very attentive and brought us napkins and to go boxes without us having to ask. I also saw him notice there was a family in line w a small child and he set up a high chair at the end of a booth before they even sat down, I thought that was A+ service.   Will be back to try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. My wife and I love falafel and are always on the look out for a good one. Well we went to a Yelp event and one of the vendors was yafo so we had tried there hummus and liked it so we figured we needed to check this place out. Wow best Mediterranean food in Charlotte by far. The fresh made pitas were amazing. My wife got a falafel pita and I got chicken shawarma wrap, they were both delicious. You also get a side with each, we got the cauliflower and that was really good too. We could not complain about anything it was all so delicious. The falfels were perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth. It was all so filling too. We will definitely be back. The only downfall it is a little on the pricer side so couldn't have it all the time."}
{"text":"I am happy to have a decent Mediterranean place nearby with tasty food.  I do have to admit that the service is pretty SLOW here.  I have been two times for lunch and both times it takes about 15 minutes to get through the line to order food and pay.  They have good brussell sprouts, cauliflower, fresh made bread, falaffals are decent...if only their service was FASTER..."}
{"text":"Very fresh and different.  Falafel wrap is huge and tasty.   Couscous is buttery well seasoned.  It is pricey.   Meals are big enough to split.  Try the watermelon lime drink. Refreshing!"}
{"text":"Update: Tastes like there's a new chef in town (or the same chef isn't on his a-game) and not for the better.  As mentioned in my previous review, I haven't had Yafo in a while but I finally had it again today.   The laffah is still a problem. Today, the consistency is decent but the taste is off. Weirdly sweet but mostly tasteless overall.    The new problem is that other kitchen items taste different. The tahini is far more bitter, leading to bitter hummus. The tabbouleh is extremely sour. Same goes for the grape leaves. Put all of those extreme flavors together and nothing really paired well like it did before.  On the plus side, my portion was much bigger than usual. However, I would trade that in for how Yafo's food used to taste in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite lunch and fast casual places in Charlotte. Can't wait for Yafo to open their Plaza Midwood location. I will add it into the rotation with Viva Chicken, and Thai Taste. Truly delicious food. I really do miss the Laffah chips though!   Don't sleep on their group meals- if you're looking to feed 5-8 people this is one of the best values for your buck and you're supporting a local restaurant instead of the moe's taco bar you're used to ordering for your work lunch. Your coworkers will thank you."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is incredible.  Food is absolutely excellent. Fresh, made to order, quick, affordable. Service is better than the food; deserves 6 stars. Needs a larger (or second) location/more seating."}
{"text":"Yafo Kitchen was a bit overwhelming.  I wish that there was a bit more assistance in understanding the options - and the mezzes.    My family was going to get the whole chicken family meal, but when we went to order, we found out that they had no whole chickens left.  So there went that option.  We quickly tried to understand the menu again and order.  I ended up with a couscous bowl - with some stuff on top.  The options, although they looked good, I was unable to point and say yes I want that -insert the food name here- because I had no idea what the things were.  I pointed and said I want the food in the upper left.  Sometimes its good to know what you're signing up for.  Mediterranean food may just not be my cup of tea."}
{"text":"You need to check this place out! The salads are great! The chicken is great!The stew is great! Listen, the brussel sprouts are great! The laffah is great! But I fell in love with the cauliflower!!! But then it disappeared one day with broccoli in its place and I became a two timer. Lastly, the staff. They are super nice and just the icing on the cake. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"Loved the falafel wrap very fresh and it was very tasty. Loved the service and the ambience."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best Mediterranean restaurant I've ever been to! The food is so flavorful. The staff are very helpful and the restaurant is really clean! You have the option to build your own Bowl which I did and it was amazing. It's really crowded at lunch but we came for dinner at around 6 p.m. and was able to order our food immediately. Also, you must get the Cucumber mint lemonade! It is the best ever! It will change your life."}
{"text":"Just delicious! I wouldn't go during a peak time on the first go around. it's nice when the line is long and chaotic so they can walk you through the menu options. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"There's not much I need to say here - 5 stars for sure. Don't be intimidated by the frequent long lines, this place is delicious and the lines move fast. 90% of the time, the workers on the line are SUPER friendly, and have been great to my kids. I would go here every day if I could! They keep it simple, the bread is made fresh, right in front of you, and all of the ingredients are wonderful. I have not had a thing I didn't enjoy here.   Excited to see more of these pop up all over Charlotte."}
{"text":"I really like Yafo.  I think its a great addition to Charlotte and is a great alternative to something like Chipotle, Panera, etc.  I do have some Yafo wishes though:  Curbside pickup A kids menu with food my kids would eat Non rolling high chairs   The staff is very friendly, the food is fresh and I think healthy!?"}
{"text":"Love this food, love this place! Even though I say I am going to get something new everytime I go, I always seem to end up with my favorite! The half/half bowl with greens and hummus with falafel and multiple toppings... sooo flavorful! I have tasted other items on the menu (via the plates of friends and family) and they are delicious as well. The major plus is that it is guilt-free eating, the Mediterranean diet is healthy AND delicious! Another plus is that the staff is made up of a great group of folks! When my family and I come in, we are always greeted with smiles and have become friendly with a few of the regulars we see.  Bottom line- Yafo, always puts a smile on my family's faces!  #faithfulcustomer"}
{"text":"So excited to have a fast casual mediterranean restaurant in Charlotte! I have been hearing all the buzz about Yafo Kitchen and decided to check it out. The restaurant is very much still in its early growing stages - I came around 7pm to grab dinner and waited a line of 10ish people for 25 minutes. The line moves slowly since there is only 1 person per each station (i.e. one server for rice/salad, one server for toppings, one server for sides, and one server for meats). This will probably be improved once the staff gets a hang of things but at this point it means you choose your base and then wait a few minutes while the person in front of you chooses their toppings, etc.  I got the impression that the Mezze/Toppings change often, but it was difficult to see what the Mezze/Toppings were since they were handwritten in a chalk board above the lettuce/salad fridge. I would recommend having labels or a diagram on the glass case so the customer can easily read. It was not clear what qualified as a Mezze or a Topping (for example the cauliflower is an extra $1 if you build your own bowl but it's in the same area as the chickpeas, picked onions, etc.  Overall, there is a lot of potential for Yafo Kitchen, hopefully they can improve lines and wait times. The food was fresh but I was underwhelmed with the flavor of the pulled chicken. Keep in mind that this place is pretty pricy for a fast casual restaurant, I ordered a salad bowl with pulled chicken and a soft drink - the total was $16. This is a lot pricy compared to the competition and other fast casual restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have gone maybe five times in the past two weeks. Everything is fresh and delicious. The jalapeño cilantro dressing is unreal. The falafel. Make your own salad. The kids mac n cheese with chicken. Very friendly employees. Usually packed at lunch. My new go-to!"}
{"text":"I had heard about it and waited too long to try. Since my first time I've been back 3 times this month. It's like a Mediterranean Chipotle and I love it. I get the bowl and I load it up. The falafel is always out and I have to wait but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I tend to be very suspicious when a restaurant claims to serve \"authentic\" food associated with a particular ethnicity, but its clientele is mostly people who don't belong to that ethnicity. Yafo Kitchen definitely seems like that kind of restaurant. The difference is that its food is amazing. The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are not toned down at all, and they have all sorts of ingredients that you wouldn't find in a generic falafel restaurant. I would eat here all the time if I lived nearby. My only complaint is that the bowls are way too large. I'd rather pay a bit less for a smaller portion."}
{"text":"They're a bit pricey. Additional prices were added to my \"create your own \" $10.99 bowl for some reason.   The falafels were really good, not too salty. Try the cucumber lime mint drink, yummy."}
{"text":"We went to YAFO last night, it was very busy they have a pretty good method to get you through quickly.  It is kind of like ordering at Chipotle.   I was a bit pressured to make my decisions because they were so busy, and it was my first visit.  My wife and I chose a custom bowl, we are both vegan.  There were great options for us.   I had rice for the base with falafel and other veggie toppings. My wife had a hummus base.   Even though they were so busy, we were able to find a place to sit easily. Both of us really enjoyed our bowls and will absolutely return."}
{"text":"This place was great. Food was delicious, fresh and healthy. I liked the build your own bowl option. I had half tzatziki and rice with all the toppings and chicken, it was so tasty. I was glad that I got there a little before the lunch rush because the line does get really long. Like another reviewer said, they could cut the portion size and charge about $2 less, my lunch was about $12 without a drink, which is kind of expensive for lunch and I could not finish. I know I can take the rest home but just prefer a smaller portion that is less $$ (the most I want to pay for lunch is $10) Only other thing was that the bathroom is on the side of the restaurant that in order to access it, you would need to cut through this huge line of people, and they keep the outer door to that side of the restaurant locked. Kind of difficult to access after you are in the dining room."}
{"text":"I'm giving Yafo 2 stars because the food is incredible and deserves 5 stars. However, the service here is absolutely horrendous and has not improved since it opened last year. I have been probably over 10 times and I have never had a pleasant experience with the staff. Today was no exception. It is a busy restaurant because the food is great, but the process here is so terrible. It's like the line employees have never been instructed on what to do or how to keep things moving. Communication in this place is bad and only seems to get worse. They finally put labels on their toppings which should have helped but didn't seem to help at all. I've waited this long to write a review because I was hoping the service would improve with time but they really need help. Take notes from the process and service and speed at Chipotle or literally anywhere honestly. I guarantee I'll be back soon because of the falafel bowl but I won't enjoy interacting with the staff. Also since when do y'all charge for pine nuts??"}
{"text":"Yafo is a great new concept when it comes to Middle Eastern food. I have my favorites for sure! The beef kofta is the best protein if you're a meat eater - if you pick this it's grilled-to-order and may come to you a few mins later if they are backed up. The falafel are a must try even if you're a meat eater. I love that it's a side option...and honestly since it's so good I haven't tried the other sides - it's not like falafel anywhere else, they're like a large tater tot size and are super crunchy and burst with flavor! Things I wish were a little different: I love the cauliflower rice tabbouli, just wish it has more herbs/flavor. I wish they would add scallions or red onion to the cucumber and tomato salad or separately...the sumac onions are just not the same as fresh. The cucumber lime mint juice is a must try, but I wish there is an option with those flavors with at least half the amount of sugar added as a healthy alternative. The customer service at Yafo matches the great food they have. They make sure you have everything you need and more. The chef/co-owner walked around to check on everyone and chatted with me about spicy foods and brought me a very spicy sauce. Keep up the great food and service, Yafo!"}
{"text":"Yafo is amazing! I love that each dish is able to be customized. I generally get mezzes or a build your own bowl. The Greek yogurt mac and cheese is delicious and something you won't find anywhere else in charlotte. I always get extra Laffah because it's so good - it's much softer than pita and you can watch them make it. The falafel is made in small batches so it's always fresh. Try the schug with the laffah, so good!"}
{"text":"This is one of the freshest restaurants around. The choice of items to build your meal can get confusing if you don't know what each item is. But they have signs up describing each item to decide what to add.  The mezzes (appetizers/sides) are so scrumptious. baked cauliflower, falafels, mac & cheese, etc.   I think the staff realizes that a lot of folks don't know what or how to order so they're friendly and can help you decide.  We usually get the build a bowl. They start with a base like rice or quinoa, then add the sides to the bowl. The protein is an extra $2.  Oh, and you have GOT to order a juice. It's real juice, not processed. You can get cucumber with lime and mint, or watermelon with lime. These drinks are very, very good. It's all you can drink, so fill up before you leave!! We will definitely be back. We've eaten here twice now and each time has been wonderful.  It can get a bit pricey but what you're getting in exchange, your body will thank you for."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and super fresh here, absolutely no complaints.  I would say the taste was as close as it could get to other authentic restaurants serving Mediterranean cuisine.  Of course the presentation and plating of the food is beautiful here.  This place has a great ambience and super tidy around. Makkaresh Lamb bowl is what I ordered and it was delicious, the lamb was so succulent and loved the taste.  I chose couscous instead of rice and some of the complimentary fixings (they have plenty and for the first time one might need to ask specifically what is what, coz there are no labels for the food).   My lady's salad bowl with chicken was tasting just as good, the shwarma chicken was so delicious and with the fresh veggies and salad fixings, it was a great meal.   you wouldn't feel guilty at all dining here unlike other Mediterranean places coz, their actual meat portion is small and all these fixings make up the major part of the bowl (ultimately making us eat lots of fresh veggies, grains, sprouts, chickpeas etc etc) Loved the place, a bit on the expensive side.  the above mentioned two bowls costs about 25 bucks but its worth it."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food, loved their hummus! Employees were very nice and explained the menu when we had questions because it was our first time there.  We will definitely go back if we are ever in the area again, unfortunately we live in New York:/"}
{"text":"Sadly the food quality is not consistent. I have been here on 4 separate occasions. On Thursday this week for dinner I ordered half hummus and half couscous. Luckily for me I had something in the bowl that was edible. The couscous was so hard it hurt my teeth crunching into it. It was dried out and old. The hummus was okay. The falafel was dried out as well. Don't think I will come back here again."}
{"text":"I'm not a meal skipper. That's not a thing I do. After lunch here (which I took about 1/3 to go) I had a smoothie for dinner.   I got a half hummus half greens bowl. Next time I want to see if they will mix the hummus, rice and greens all up.   Hummus was delish but I think for me an all hummus bowl would have been too much.   I told the folks behind the counter it was my first time and even though they were packed they were super patient with me. Giving samples of the meat (that lamb!) and explaining all the toppings and salad dressings.   Fingers crossed for a second location in a different part of town soon."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for a late lunch with my husband who is actually middle eastern. I had read great reviews and couldn't wait to try it! It was totally empty when we got here and I decided to have a bowl with rice, hummus, falafel and salad. My husband had a lamb wrap to go. While I thoroughly enjoyed my bowl I will say that I had to use a lot of the sauces which had been kindly given to us on the side (tahini, coriander dressing and a habanero) in order for it to be truly delicious... the falafel was small and crunchy and the hummus was tasty. I'd give it 4/5. My husband didn't really enjoy the lamb, saying it didn't have much taste and he didn't care for it being pulled rather than typical gyro style - he is extremely fussy though... the price was pretty ridiculous however, $26, the portion is generous but I don't think the price is justified. I also expected to get bread on the side with my bowl, but didn't... I used a wrap from home instead"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with coworkers.  I ordered the Shawarma and found it very tasty.  I'm not as experiened with this style of food to critique.  Interestingly, the vibe I was getting was this place is attempting to be the Zoe's or Chipotle of this type of food.  Can't really pin it down, though.  Nevertheless, the lunch was good and I was plenty filled up and my coworkers seemed pleased."}
{"text":"I had a salad with tabouleh, tomatoes and cucumbers and chickpeas, hummus, baba ganoush, and the cilantro jalapeño vinaigrette. Oh and lamb.  Outstanding!!! Pricy but definitely worth it for such a fresh healthy tasty meal.  Cucumber tea is to die for."}
{"text":"Yafo is awesome. It's best described as the Chipotle of Mediterranean food. It's a new concept restaurant opened by the same restaurant group that runs Midwood Smokehouse and Paco's Tacos & Tequila.   Walking in for the first time can be a bit overwhelming. The menu is pretty huge for a place that feels like it should be quick. The basic idea is - pick a bowl, a wrap, or a salad to start, then top it whatever strikes your fancy. The toppings in the black containers are free and the ones in the white containers will cost you a bit extra. I really love the hummus bowl with chicken ($10.99). The portions are HUGE. The hummus bowl starts with almost 2 FULL scoops of hummus. The bowl was served with fresh made laffa bread (think pita without the pocket) and a great cilantro jalapeno sauce. It is easily enough food for two people and then some. Both times I went, I split the hummus bowl with someone else and took enough home for a third meal.   I really enjoyed their pickles, brussels, and falafel.  Honestly, my suggestion would be to make the portion sizes a little smaller and charge $2 less for the mains."}
{"text":"Both times I have visited Yafo Kitchen, the place has been packed and there's definitely a reason(s) why. I love the open menu where you can either build from the bottom or choose an item already designed for you. Both times I have built my own salad topped with chicken, tabouli, chickpea salad, purple cabbage, hummus, cucumber/tomato salad and tzaziki. I have yet to try the sides from the hot bar but the grilled cauliflower always looks amazing, along with the brussel sprouts and mac n' cheese. I will definitely be coming back to mix up my menu next time! Also the Watermelon Lime juice is AMAZING! Definitely worth the extra cost"}
{"text":"I can't rave about this place enough. It's basically a Mediterranean version of chipotle. Build your own salads, bowls or wraps. They also have menu items to pick from if you'd rather. The only down side is the line wraps around out the door during prime time hours. But there's a reason for it. If you haven't tried it you are definitely missing out."}
{"text":"Well this's more American Mediterranean restaurant.. the food is fine, nothing special, Mediterranean style maybe but If you looking for authentic Mediterranean restaurant that's not the right place."}
{"text":"Strongly agree with the other excellent reviews. We ate there on a very busy Saturday night and had the lamb couscous, lamb gyro along with five mouth watering sides (called mezzes) which included falafel, brussel sprouts, mac & cheese, baked cauliflower and hummus. Everything was superb except the lamb was shredded and seasoned in such a way that my wife and I did not prefer. Service was provided by a bevy of teenagers whose enthusiasm ranged from disinterested to giddy. We'll definitely return (but will  order the chicken next time)."}
{"text":"This place is right up my alley so I had a very difficult time deciding what to get. It was a toss up between the falafel wrap or the bowl. After talking to a few of the employees they steered me towards the BYO option. You can do a salad, bowl, wrap or half n half.   I got the half n half bowl ($8.99) with chicken added (+$2). The bowl came with a generous portion of jasmine rice and hummus. You can also pick between couscous, tzatziki or baba ganoush. For toppings I kept it very simple and went with the cucumber tomato salad and chicken. I know that's basic, but next time I will venture out. They have about 7 toppings included within the original $8.99 price, but also a variety of other toppings (avocado, beets, roasted cauliflower) for an additional price.   The bowl was amazing! The hummus was smooth and probably one of the best I've ever had. The cucumber salad was a nice touch and I drizzled a little tzatziki on top of it! Even my husband enjoined it! The bonus is that I didn't feel like crap after eating it. It was heathy, filling and damn good!   My husband got the 1/4 chicken with brussel sprouts and Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese was out of this world. It's made with Greek yogurt and it was bomb.com. I highly recommend getting it as your side.   However they real reason I gave this place a 5 is because the executive chef came out at the end of our meal and thanked us for coming in. He also asked if there was anything else they could do to improve our visit- the answer was no. Yafo was great and I will be returning again soon!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! This place is the best! Their bowls and sides are so flavorful and unique. It's my favorite new place!"}
{"text":"Proof that fast/order up can be delicious, well prepared and somewhat healthy! We split a custom bowl and a couple of hot mezzes and everything was really good. All the goodies (felafel, pickled onion, tomato, chickpea salad, feta, mushrooms etc) were well prepared and what was served to us was this beautiful arrangement of color. I think In the 10 minutes we were in line they powered through 100 orders. It was busy but you can tell there was some crowd engineering that went into the workflow of the place. It runs like a machine. Awesome for a no-fuss, reasonable price point, but still very tasty option in charlotte."}
{"text":"***update: I changed my review from 4 starts to 5 stars after the owner thanked me for the review and they also added signage to make it easier to order****  Fantastic food. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think the servers could do a better job with helping people figure out the menu and how to order. Sometimes it takes forever to order because people eating there for the first time get confused about the menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte hands down.  The chicken, falafel, hummus, brussell sprouts, mac n cheese, and roasted potatoes are all amazing.  I'm sure everything else on the menu is, too!"}
{"text":"First stop at Yafo.  Delicious - flavorful - fresh.   Had the Galilee Kofta and was completely blown away by the variety and complex flavors presented.  I will absolutely be back.  Lamb next!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Israel and this place make me feel a little closer to home.   Of course the food in Israel is way better but with the vegetables and meat quality in USA this is the best you can do."}
{"text":"Since my first review I have been back several times and have been continually impressed by the quality of the food and service. The prices are a bit steep for a fast-casual place but you get what you pay for with good quality, fresh food. My favorite is the build-your-own grain bowl with falafel and almost all the toppings! I love that they are willing to let me have a little bit of each of the spreads instead of only choosing one, and I typically like a drizzle of the mint vinaigrette on top. The roasted potatoes topped with Granch aka Greek ranch are such a guilty pleasure! I crave Yafo regularly.  My only complaint is that its often difficult to know which of the toppings are included in the price of the bowl and which are extra (i.e. beets, brussel sprouts) as you're going through the line."}
{"text":"Fresh healthy food. The line can move slowly based on the folks in front of you but the staff worked well. My only complaint is I asked about nutrition /sugar in the dressings and really couldn't get an answer. Counting carbs I like to know what I'm eating . I will return but at off peak hours"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Best Mediterranean food I've ever had.  So yummy and great quality!"}
{"text":"I work nearby the Yafo Kitchen in South Park and usually have it for lunch 1-2 times a month. I'm excited to hear they're opening one in Plaza Midwood as well since that's close to where I live. It's a great fast-casual concept with fresh ingredients and quick service. Even at peak lunch time I'm out the door in 20 minutes if I take my food to go.   I always get the Yafo Schwarma bowl with chicken. I like to add in hummus and chickpea salad. I sometimes also add avocado. It's really delicious and reasonably healthy with lots of fresh vegetables and grains. The flavor combinations are delicious. I like to get a bit of everything in each bite. It doesn't look like that much food but I am rarely ever able to finish the whole thing in one sitting. They give you a side of their fresh flatbread with every order - It's almost like a pita. The bread, grains, and chicken fill me up quick, leaving enough for a second meal later on.   I've had the wraps as well and they are just as delicious, but very messy. All of the sides are amazing, particularly the Brussels sprouts. They are sautéed with dates to add a sweet flavor. The mac and cheese is creamy, crunchy, greatness.   Yafo will be a go-to spot for us for years to come."}
{"text":"This place has great healthy food options, I try different things every time I go. Great for lunch or dinner, because their portions are huge."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Everything that I tasted was delicious, and since I went with my family I got to taste most of the menu!  Yafo has a lot of variety of options, but my personal favorite is the sabich, which is fried eggplant, hard-boiled egg, pickles, slaw, and delicious sauces wrapped in a house made lafah bread. In terms of salads and sides I loved the quinoa salad made with preserved lemon and cranberries, the roasted Brussels sprouts, the hummus and babaganush. The flavors are incredibly fresh, lots of produce is locally sourced, and the concept is authentic. Reminds me of eating in Tel Aviv.   Other table favorites were the falafel, the Yafo shawarma bowl, the kafta meatballs and the Marrakesh lamb bowl. They even have a kids menu and high chairs.    We loved it, and can't wait to be regulars.  Updated: went back ... Again... I took a break from the sabich (my personal favorite) and ordered the Sharon salad- it was delicious. Over the greens you get a scoop of the quinoa salad with preserved lemons AND a scoop of couscous, beets, goat cheese etc with yummy vinaigrette. The veggies are so fresh, and the flavors are so crisp and vibrant. Throw a few pieces of falafel on top!  Friends ordered the kofta aka kabob aka Middle Eastern meatballs, served in a red sauce that is simmered with warm Mediterranean spices (think cinnamon...). Unlike any other meatball you've had."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place!  It did not disappoint.  Cute atmosphere and great little shaded patio.  The food was really yummy - had the chicken shawarma wrap, brussels sprouts and beets with goat cheese.  Great flavors.  Can't wait to go back and try some other dishes - falafel! They have a bunch of flavored juices by the tea.  I strongly recommend the cucumber lime mint.  It was so delicious.  And hooray for crunchy ice too!"}
{"text":"Really good food but I have found some inconsistency on the flavors and even the amount of food that they serve. Also, for some reason they always run out of falafel.. My guess is that they do small a small batch to keep them fresh but they should find a better solution. The lines sometimes are unnecessarily long but worth the wait."}
{"text":"For fast and healthy food...amazing!  First, I am thrilled that Charlotte is starting to venture beyond tacos and hot dogs.  Second, every single item I placed in my mouth was amazing.  I had heard it was hard to know when building your own bowl what was included in the price and what was extra.  But, I was told, the white dishes are add-ons.  I had the grain bowl (1/2 jasmine rice and 1/2 couscous), feta, tzatzki, chickpea salad, tomato/cucumbers, red cabbage and added beets and chicken.  Delicious!!  Everything was fresh and packed with flavor!  We also had 1/4 chicken with two sides (potatoes and tomato/olives).  Moist chicken and the potatoes needed absolutely nothing, they were that good!  The cilantro sauce is drinkable, it's that good.  Last, the shawarma wrap with a side of brussel sprouts, again amazing!  Next time I will get a mezze plate because the vegetables are flavorful and everything I could ever need.  Can't wait to try the falafel, too!  I was beyond impressed with Yafo.  Thrilled to have food in Charlotte that is outside of the bland box!"}
{"text":"The chicken swarma was good! The menu was a bit overwhelming for a new person. The staff was pretty much trying to get you through the line. However, when you asked, they were more than willing to offer samples. The sandwich got soggy with the juices of the meat and sauce. I think next time I'll get individual pieces and make many small sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food that has some tasty healthy options too. It's always crowded at lunch so come early or late. It's pretty reasonable too."}
{"text":"I can't comment about how the food is because I didn't get to eat dinner here. I arrived tonight with a friend for her birthday. She's a nursing mother and sat down to feed her child while we got in line to order food.  The manager came to us and said we couldn't sit until we had food, and she proceeded to remove the mother and child from the table so that four young folks could sit down.  These folks drove 35 miles to eat at this restaurant, which we promptly left, and we will never come back. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Decided to try Yafo restaurant for dinner with friends. The restaurant had bright interiors and lot of comfortable seatings. The outdoor space was beautiful with benches and pillows but that day was too cold to sit outside.   The Mediterranean restaurant had a real easy menu. You choose between a wrap, bowl or a hummus and you get to choose the greenies, sauces and protein just like any other deli.   The hummus tasted great and the vegetables were super fresh. The best part was the freshly cooked vegetables - the falafel balls were crispy hot, the cauliflower was fried to beautiful brown color, the potato wedges were cooked with skin on, and the Brussels sprouts were awesome.   I had a grain bowl with half quinoa and half rice, chicken shawarma and a lot of veggies. My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and took our resolution to come back here often."}
{"text":"Amazing food every time I come here.  I can never decide what to get because it's all good.  Love the chicken in hummus bowl."}
{"text":"One of my favorites!! Food is always delicious and one serving is plenty of food. Only drawback is it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"I've been pretty much obsessed with this place within a month of it opening. The food is always fresh. The selections are numerous and  vegetarian friendly. The bread is made right in front of you and it probably some of the best pita-ish bread you can get in Charlotte. The lines can sometimes be long but it's always worth the wait. The staff is always very helpful and the dining area is kept clean. They have that \"good\" ice too the cylinder kind that is soft and crunchy so yeah. I really love this place and glad they seem to have made themselves a staple in the neighborhood with so many dining options nearby. I've introduced a lot of people to this place and haven't had a complaint yet."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming in for lunch. Like my first visit, I ordered a 'build your own bowl'. For me this included half hummus and half rice as a base topped with  cucumber, sumac onion, roasted mushrooms, shawarma chicken and a dollop of tzatziki. I had tahini on the side which I didn't use for whatever reason. The meal comes with pita bread. I also ordered a side of soup to take home for dinner. My bowl was fresh and delicious. Absolutely love the hummus which they top with paprika, olive oil and a few other things before building the bowl. Soup was flavorful but a bit on the salty side for me. Will certainly go back again."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing for 2 reasons.   1. This place is truly amazing! The food is fresh, and delicious. Their recipes are full of flavor and love! It's a favorite in Charlotte! These people know how to run a good restaurant! Morgan couscous isn't supposed to have flavor. Do you expect the white rice you get with Chinese to have flavor? No, It's the specialty crafted sauces, dips, vegetables and meats that pack the flavor and they do an awesome job!  2. JB the reason there is a long line is because the food is truly 1 of a kind! Yelpers ignore JBs review and any other nay sayers. It's worth the wait! The staff moves as fast as they can with the high volume of guests they serve and always go above and beyond!   Thank you YAFO!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal. As an Israeli this type of food was missing in Charlotte and it was as close to my Grandma's cooking as possible. Which is saying a lot. You can't go wrong with anything you order. My wife had the lamb grain bowl and I had the kofta grain bowl which was amazing. Everything tasted very fresh and homemade. The chef even walked around and we got to meet him. I would recommend that if you get a grain bowl ask for \"majadra\" instead of rice... It's hard to pronounce but it is phenomenal. The space is beautiful and they're about to open a patio. They serve local beers and have great service."}
{"text":"Family meal deal is the real MVP!! You won't find a better deal or a more delicious meal to feed your family in Charlotte! My husband and I can get at least 2 and sometimes 3 full meals out of it! My only complaint is the brussel sprouts are very oily (like literally a pool of oil in the bottom of the container) but I usually just add a full bag of steamed ones from home and problem solved!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and this spot was recommended. It's like a chipotle of middle eastern Israeli cuisine. The line can get long, the place is popular, but moves quickly. You order, build your own bowl, wrap or salad, then seat yourself with your creation. Upon entering, watch the worker make and bake the delicious laffah bread.  The food was fantastic. I had a bowl with chicken. Others had wraps or bowl with lamb. Portions were large (for the bowls). The cucumber mint juice was refreshing. Oh, and the macaroni and cheese made with yogurt is rich and delicious.  If the owner is reading this, please consider opening a location in Boca Raton FL."}
{"text":"This's great fast food, with plenty of choices, during lunch time the line could get to the door but it moves fast, it could take 20-30 minutes o get your food, their mac and cheese is excellent. We'll definitely comeback here."}
{"text":"Finally tried this restaurant today! So good!! I had the quarter chicken with a cold side, and a hot side. They had so many options that looked delicious! Again, love the fast casual concept and many different options! I found the staff to be friendly and explained everything really well! I can't wait to go back and try something else! It all looks delicious!"}
{"text":"Yafo is my go-to place for that Mediterranean craving. Delicious food that you can feel not so guilty about eating and actually get full from.   Order the kofta!!! I usually get a half salad half rice bowl with kofta on top and then basically every side they have."}
{"text":"Chipotle + rainbow + South Park = YAFO! Looking for a colorful, healthy, vegetarian-friendly, fast-casual dining experience? Make your way to Yafo and go home happy.  My sister's family was in town from NY and with my nephew's limited food options (allergies and no meat), Yafo was the perfect place to meet my cousin for lunch. We all enjoyed the big window displaying the laffah bread-making process and individually made our way down the assembly line with our meals. The fresh juices (cucumber mint lime, lemonade, watermelon lime) were in full view of the cashier, so it was easy to order something besides water and on a return trip I'll certainly grab a cookie.  I went for a half and half bowl (lettuce and bulgar) and the guy behind the counter had plenty of personality, which made assembling my bowl more fun than normal. Everyone else eating with me for lunch enjoyed their meal and the service was both fast and friendly. Strong work Yafo."}
{"text":"I love this place.  So fresh and delicious. The prices are really good for all the things you can get. I am lucky I don't live so close to it or I would be eating there every day."}
{"text":"The food is great. My favourite is quinoa, baba ganoush, hummus and the lamb curry combo."}
{"text":"Food looks good and tastes bomb. It also is super fresh. It has a hip and fun vibe, which I'm into. There was lots of light because of the windows which added more to the ambiance. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is probably the only Mediterranean place in Charlotte which I liked till date. They so justified their tag line\" EAT Hotest\" And honestly, I enjoyed every bite. Pitas were soft and chicken bowl was delicious . A must place to come again. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Eh.   Pros-  - Fun location  - decent amount of food for the price  - healthy     Cons-  - I felt like it was modern Mediterranean food and I wasn't in love with it.  - the lamb was shredded with sauce over it so it didn't even taste like fresh lamb.  - menu was confusing  - I personally didn't like the food  - weird after taste   I was excited to eat here but the staff was so unprofessional except one guy who was taking our order on 2/26 around 3 PM besides this guy ( I tried to get his name but none of the staff was wearing name tags) the rest of the staff seemed like it was their first day. What seemed to the be the manager was very rude to these guys behind us. It was just a really negative, weird experience with a lot of attitude.  Not even an attitude with us but all of the staff seemed to hate  each other. I don't know weird vibe. Totally ruined the experience.  Mostly likely won't go back. I want real Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Really yummy! Great food, and a lot of it, for the money. On the whole, I think everything was fairly healthy too.   The only \"knock\" is the ordering of the build your own opinions. There are a lot of choices, which could be a tad overwhelming, but the bigger issue for me was certain options mix better with other ones. For example, if you want lamb, certain sauces and veggies are best. The staff is very good at helping you managing the process, but personally I wished there were more notes on the menu to help you out before you begin ordering (I hate being the holdup). It's a minor complaint, that does not stop me giving 5 stars, nor will it keep me from going back."}
{"text":"It was love at first site when I met Yafo. I had a friendly, quick and absolutely delicious experience the first time I visited. Who doesn't want fast, gourmet Mediterranean food that leaves you feeling satisfied?   The second time wasnt the same. My main girl and I decided to grab food after Crossfit about 10 minutes before they closed. We got there and placed our order along with a couple other employees that were being let go early. It was when our wraps were being sloppily put together with scarce leftovers where we felt our love for Yafo fade. They didn't ask us if we wanted certain ingredients our wraps. They automatically put our food in to go cups (ultimately making our food soggy). We ended up sitting on the bench outside because we were pushed out of the restaurant after snide comments made from all the employees. I don't care if I walk into the restaurant 5 minutes before you close, keep your attitude to yourself. I work in food service and never in my life would I run a customer out of the restaurant just because I've had a long day and want to go home."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for so long because of all the trendy pics of their bowls on instagram! I'm SO glad I finally decided to come, since Yafo's just became one of my new favorite places(: I ordered the half and half bowl(DO IT) with half grains/salad. I love how there's so many fresh veggies you can choose from, it's a bit overwhelming not gonna lie LOL. Also every bowl comes with pita bread, omggg loveee! Their pita bread is freshly made, literally right in front of you. I'm so excited to come back next time and try more things of the menu! Only complaint is that Yafo's is 45 minutes away from me, srsly why haven't I came here sooner?!"}
{"text":"I will definitely be back to Yafo! I ordered the hummus bowl with schwarma chicken. The chicken was super glacial. You also have a selection of toppings to pick from to put in your bowl. I added tomatoes, olives, feta, and chickpeas with red pepper (redundant to add chickpeas to top hummus, I know, don't judge). It was everything I love in a bowl. It was delicious. Plus, you get a big piece of their homemade flat bread, which was really fluffy and better than pita. The mint sauce on the side was tasty, too. My friend ordered a 5 mezze plate. I tried her brussel sprouts and falafel and will get them next time!"}
{"text":"This might be the best restaurant in Charlotte. I've tried everything on the menu and you truly can't go wrong. My issue is usually trying to pare down the amount of food so I'm not stuffed! It's also pretty quick to get through the line and they have helpful staff. I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Finally stopped by for lunch ~ and loved it! ~ then was back another two times in the same week with more disappointing results. At my first visit, I ordered roasted cauliflower, which was delicious. It wasn't offered on my next visit so I ordered the roasted potatoes instead and was told by the server that they were drizzled with drippings from the roasted lamb. Not great for vegetarians or vegans. Now I'm wondering how the other vegetables are prepared and I've lost my enthusiasm for this place."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The customer service is A+. The options are great. I got a chicken shawarma, with tabouli. The tabouli was very different because it wasn't use to how it was prepared. They put way too many ingredients in it which I wasn't accustomed to nor was I have fanned of. It still wasn't a bad taste. The chicken shwarma was also a little bit different but I still enjoyed it. The mint lemonade was awesome. I will be returning to try something else."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's quick and on the healthier side of eating out. I especially love the Mac and cheese and the cucumber lime juice"}
{"text":"The food is very, very good. I have to hand it to them, everything that I had was delicious, we got the falafel, mac and cheese, a chicken shwarma bowl, and some of the side sauces. I just think that ordering process is a little overwhelming. When I first got in line, I figured out what I wanted, but there was no menu board listing the sides, I actually ended up looking them up on my phone while waiting to order so I would know what's what. The staff are very nice, but I think they need to start asking customers if it's their first time at the restaurant or not before they order, the person helping me had to repeat themselves a few times because I wasn't sure what they were asking. They forgot to give me any laffa bread with any of my items, I even heard the cashier ask for some, get no response, and then just give up and tell me to have a nice day so she could speed the line along. I think if the ordering process could be a little more streamlined, then this place really would be a real gem. Maybe I'll just try ordering online next time."}
{"text":"I love Yafo Kitchen! When I was an amateur I ordered wraps. THEN I realized if you get a bowl, it comes with that lovely laffa bread on the side and you can make your own wraps out of the contents in the bowl. The bowl also holds a lot more than a wrap will and you can get things that would be funky in wrap form, like beet salad or chickpea salad. Just order the bowl, okay??  The falafel is fantastic and the real unsung hero is the mushrooms! Get them on your bowl, trust me. I don't know how they're seasoned but they add an awesome flavor to the bowl.   My favorite bowl: 1/2 and 1/2 bowl with greens and cous cous  Hummus and baba ganouj  Beet salad  Chickpea salad  Tomato/cucumber salad  Pickles  Kalamata olives  Sumac onions  Cabbage slaw  Falafel  Mushrooms  And a side of schug!   I can easily make two meals out of this.   My only gripe with Yafo is that they were careless with animal products, twice.  One time, they were scooping chicken for another customer and dripped the chicken liquid across my wrap.  A second time, someone had spilled feta into the pickles. When I asked if she could try to avoid the spilled feta and just give me pickles, she replied \"we cannot guarantee our ingredients will be vegan\". I just replied, I get that but as you're scooping can you try to avoid the feta that fell into the pickles?   I'm still giving them 5 stars because the food is so good! But if you are vegan, just watch for the potential cross contamination."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food in all of NC. I got the chicken shawarma, sabich, and falafel sandwiches on warm fresh laffa bread. Everything is top notch and home made. Mac and cheese, cauliflower, and Brussel sprouts were amazing sides."}
{"text":"If I've learned anything from my time in Charlotte, it's when Frank Scibelli is behind something, you need to go ahead and plan on multiple visits.  Yafo did not disappoint. I had the Chicken Shawarma Grain Bowl and loved it. It was bursting with flavor. I had a choice of quinoa and jasmine rice and went with the rice. I couldn't resist ordering a side of Falafels and was really pleased with them. They were not dry like a lot of other places that serve them. They are smaller in size so maybe that is contributing factor.  My friends had the roast chicken, shawarma wrap, mac and cheese and brussel sprouts. Everything was incredible. I love there is another place in Charlotte that now does fantastic brussel sprouts.  It is fast casual dining so it is really easy for everyone to go through the line, order what you want and then find a table or get it to go. Knowing that (different from Scibelli's other creations), I can visit a lot more often when I am eating by myself or need to grab something quickly.  They had a lot of delicious looking sides and mezzes so the hardest part will be deciding what to eat next time I visit. Everything was reasonably priced and I can be filled for $9-16 depending on if I get sides and such."}
{"text":"Food is great and lots of vegetarian / vegan options. Can't wait for this to open in Plaza Midwood. It is a little more expensive than your typical fast casual place."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and the staff could not be friendlier. The bowls are fantastic, mix and match any ingredients you want, what could be better? If you are looking for the best Mediterranean food in Charlotte, look no further."}
{"text":"I am totally in love with this place. Every time I'm back in Charlotte, I crave Yafo's food. Have never had a bad dining experience here. Service is prompt and efficient, and the workers are always warm and responsive. I typically order the hummus bowl with chicken, and add a few veggies such as diced tomatoes, avocados, and tabbouleh. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who may be seeking a nice sit-down restaurant serving authentic, delicious Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"Yafo is such a great fast Mediterranean spot to try. The flavors are so good, the ingredients taste so fresh and my service this time was great. I tried a Chicken Laffah wrap and it was really great, however the way it was wrapped, I had a hard time eating it like a sandwich ( what can I say, I'm a novice to Mediterranean). I ended up forking my way through it. It's what is on the inside that counts anyway. The chicken that comes with the laffah is pulled chicken, savory and tender, seasoned with herbs and spice. I couldn't taste very much salt, so it's likely this is lower sodium fast food, however I couldn't find nutrition information on their website. Nevertheless, my sandwich was AMAZING and did not taste salty, and the Laffah itself (bread) was a little bit TOO good...meaning it was perfect."}
{"text":"We had heard good things about Yafo and were in the mood for a good falafel. The restaurant was packed but the line moved pretty quickly. We ended up getting the Lamb bowl and the falafel wrap. We weren't sure what to get as a side, luckily for us they allowed us to sample several of them. Fresh tasting ingredients = no complaints from us."}
{"text":"What can I say except this place is da bomb!  The food is delicious, and the customer service...it's one of the best!  They were super nice and enthusiastic to greet my friend and I.  Even when I made the mistake of thinking they had a sushi bowl as a special because of a sign outside from a next door restaurant.  I had the Galilee Kofta bowl and it's really good.  The babaganoush  was excellent!  I'm coming back to try their other bowls and mezzo plates!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food at Yafo is hard to beat. You can tell that the ingredients are fresh and that the owner really takes care in what is served. The grain bowl is my go-to and since the portions are so large I always have leftovers. A great spot for healthy, quick food in a convenient location."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Yafo Kitchen. Upon walking in, we were immediately greeted by one of the guys but following that, the service quickly declined which was disappointing. One of the food preparers was very short with us as she made my bowl and then the woman who rang us up followed suit. I simply asked her if there were any sauces to accompany the bowl. Obviously very annoyed, she didn't even attempt to answer my question, quickly made 3 little containers of the different sauces available and told me my food total without even ever making eye contact.   When it comes down to it, the food was delicious and very fresh. I just wish our experience had been better. For that reason, it does not make us want to return again which is such a shame. This would be a great go to lunch or quick dinner spot otherwise."}
{"text":"Very fresh food.  Great concept. Clean dining space.  Nice TVs.  Good service.  People really love it, comes highly praised.  I thought it was above average but a bit pricey."}
{"text":"This is probably the best mediterranean food I've had in such a long time! They were very helpful, great customer service! Thank you guys!!"}
{"text":"The menu board is a little bit confusing to me but overall the food and cleanliness was outstanding. The quinoa chicken salad (I'm not sure of the correct name) was the best. Loved the seating and colors."}
{"text":"Very good! I am visiting from Charleston and I wish I lived closer. Did a build your own bowl. The chicken was delicious."}
{"text":"YUM YUM and more YUM. I don't care how much I eat here, I never feel guilty because the food is so fresh and delicious. The service is great and the people are helpful. Some things to note:  Their menu could be a little more explanatory being that there are some things I'm hesitant to try but only because there is no explanation of what it is.  Every time I've gone, normally around lunch, the line takes about 10 minutes to get through.  Seating is limited. It's a little pricier than what you would expect to pay at lunch.  You have to park in a lot or parking garage, which can be kind of frustrating if you've never been to this area, which was exactly the case for me the first time I went. Now I'm a pro, so parking has nothing on me."}
{"text":"Ughh Yafo. This place is the freaking best. Lafa bread gave me renewed reasons to live, seriously. I like to create my own bowl with a 50/50 mix of greens and babaganoush. My favorite meat option is the spiced beef."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The ingredients are amazing and fresh as well as sooooo flavorful.  Portion sizes are huuuge and the staff is excellent and very helpful. We will be regulars here.  Love this concept as well. 1 thing that i would change is the baklava i can tell its not made there."}
{"text":"This place is my new obsession.  I'm a sucker for make-your-own anything, so naturally I fell in love with Yafo Kitchen the moment I walked in the door.  This place is a a Mediterranean restaurant concept with lots of great flavors and food choices.  You can either get a pre-set item or make your own salad or rice bowl.  You have a bunch of free toppings that come with the bowl, such as hummus, cucumbers, couscous, etc.  You also have a choice of protein for $2.00 extra (I tried the shredded lamb and it was pretty good).  Even though your bowl will totally fill you up, save room for some of their sides.  If you add them on top of your bowl, it's an extra $0.99.  If you get it on the side to have a larger portion, it's an extra $1.99.  I tried the Brussels, cauliflower, and Mac & Cheese and they were ALL great.  Also a plus are the fountain drinks they have on the side as soda alternatives.  The lemonade was awesome, and they also had cucumber mint and watermelon.  By the time I finished piling everything on my tray, my bill was $23!  Yes, a bit pricey, but I will tell you that everything was totally fresh and I was full for most of the next day (yeah, I admit, I ate too much).  I will certainly be a regular here.  It's great if you just want to sit down for a casual, good quality lunch on a weekend or dinner with family/friends.  I went on Sunday night and it was totally packed.  Expect to wait in line, but no worries on the seating because they have plenty of tables."}
{"text":"oo crap!!!  as a native vegan from Los Angeles, hunting for great, diverse, plentiful, delicious vegan food here has been difficult. I'm grateful to have found Yafos!  I started with the falafel wrap. AMAZING. So I came back the next day and got falafel again and brought hubby home a Yafo Shawarma (chicken). Their laffah is amazing. Soft. Warm. Everything from their pickled toppings to their condiments are seasoned so well! Such colorful and tasty ingredients, I've come back probably 8 times in a month. Eggplant, falafel, mixed mushrooms, this is a vegans heaven! After the falafel wrap I tried their bowls and I haven't gone back since. Some days I'll get falafel and keep it minimal but they have many delicious toppings and dressings, it's so hard to not try every combination! So far, my favorite combo has been half salad and half rotating grain bowl, hummus and zaaluk, falafel, cucumber and tomato salad with sumac onions as Mediterranean pickles, spicy red schug, toum, and lemon tahini  writing it out just makes me want a bowl right now!   Parking can be difficult to find at times so try to avoid 12pm if you can! Lots of people dine here for lunch  and the line gets long but they're very quick to get everyone's orders fulfilled. If you eat here often like me, your bank account can dwindle right before your freaking eyes!! But for high quality ingredients and tasty food, worth it! Thanks Yafo!"}
{"text":"Amazing, healthy, fast food! I could eat here everyday,  if my wallet allowed (can get pricey but definitely worth it).  There's a similar place in DC, so I couldn't wait to try this. I've only tried the bowls (half rice &salad) and the bread (the best! ), but my friends say the sides are delish too! It can be overwhelming if it is your first visit. The servers move so fast that some lacked the time to tell you what is what, so be familiar with your choices before you go or read the menu as you wait in line.  Some of the line servers are really friendly and will help you,  others not so much. I would suggest they label the options to make picking what you want a lot easier."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I have found in Charlotte!  Fresh food and fresh atmosphere.  This is a place where you walk to the counter and place your order.   When you get to the counter, the selections are vast and there's a million different hummus flavors and sauces and dressings.  I built my own salad and had the most delicious beets and garbanzos and chicken and finely chopped cucumbers and tomatoes.   I topped it with a lemon vinigarette. Lip smacking good.  I loved the beverage selections too.  I would suggest trying the lime cucumber drink. It was yummy and I refilled three times!   My only recommendation to management would be to turn down the music a notch or two.  While we were eating, the music became more of a distraction than an enhancer of ambiance.   The vet called me to give me some lab results for the pooches, and I had to struggle to hear what she said.  And no, I don't think it's because of hearing loss.   This restaurant is a keeper on my list and I would happily  tell the world about it.  Go!"}
{"text":"This is a great healthy lunch spot. Definitely gets crowded during lunch, so would highly recommend ordering online. We did the build your own salads and were pleasantly surprised that warm pita was included."}
{"text":"I am soooo in love with Yafo!  This place is really incredible!!  Frank Scibelli, the man behind such places as Mama Ricotta's and Midwood Smokehouse has done it again! The recipes and menu were created by Chef Einat Admony (who has 3 NYC restaurants and a food truck).  The actual execution of this deliciousness is taken care of by Executive Chef Shai Fargian (also Israeli) - he even stopped at our table during our meal to make sure everything was to our liking - pretty cool!  Everything is made in house and fresh (local and organic ingredients) including the Laffah Bread and Falafel - both of which are incredible by the way! Laffa is kind of like pita but better - and when it's fresh from the oven - whoa! The falafel, I dare say is perfect - not oily/greasy, great crunch, great flavor!!  You can order a grain bowl or a wrap with anything from shawarma to lamb. We ordered a chicken shawarma bowl to split and a tray of 5 Mezze (side dishes). Everything was amazing. You can choose from hot or cold Mezze. We tried pickled vegetables, brussel sprouts with dates, Israeli Couscous, roasted cauliflower and beets with pistachios and goat cheese.  I would eat anything off the menu - it's just all so well done that it is mind boggling!  House made teas with different flavors and flair - about eight local beers on tap including - OMB, Triple C and Birdsong!  I can't even remember what color the chairs/booths were or if there was any artwork on the walls! That's how much attention you'll be giving the food!!!"}
{"text":"Finally found my falafel fix in charlotte ... and then some . Been to this place twice and both times it has been amazing , the staff friendly and service amazing , everything tastes fresh , we had to wait a little for the Mac and cheese which was no bother at all but they offered us a free cookie anyway . The best thing about this place is the fresh in house made Pitta so soft and tasty ."}
{"text":"Yafo is by far one of my absolute favorite spots for lunch and dinner. They are awesome with customer service and the food is always delicious! They are also available on door dash. LOVE this style of food and the way Yafo Kitchen prepares it. Been going here for about 8+ months and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing. We eat here ALL THE TIME. Casual enough to bring our kids, but a cool enough ambience for a date as well. The food is so, so good, and really filling. It tastes good for you while delicious as well. So glad this place exists. There needs to be more of them.  I can't wait to eat there again. We sometimes take out as well. A good way to skip the line and enjoy the food at home."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The falafel is amazing and the build a bowl is really good. The cauliflower is hands down the best around. They are always packed when I go so that's a good sign for sure. Now they need to open one in Mint Hill!"}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here and I just stopped in for a snack. The sides are amazing especially the fried Cauliflower! I would normally have given it 4 stars however the price of the drinks really upset me. My friend paid for the food cash it wasn't cheap but not really over priced however when I realized that they forgot to include our drinks I went back up there and for two fountain drinks it cost $6.47. That's $2.99 for a Coke that probably cost the restaurant $.10 a serving. This price gorging is probably why I will never come in here again."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious, absolutely delicious. The reasons for my rating are the following: $30 for two shawarmas, a side each (small portions) and two fountain drinks seems excessive. I was going to go 4/5 because the food really is tasty and fresh but what left a sour taste in my mouth was the amount, or lack there of, of chicken that was put on my chicken shawarma, 3-4 small pieces of pulled chicken breast. I've had shawarmas in Turkey and Romania and those babies should be stuffed, STUFFED, with that tasty rotisserie chicken seasoned to perfection. I also wish there was an option to add fries right inside of it, it takes the entire experience to a whole new level.   My significant other and I had lunch, we were full and satisfied, I just feel like we could have gotten a bit more for our money for $30. That is all.   Everything tasted great and I have to say the organic tea and watermelon juice were the best I've ever had. You know how anything watermelon flavored usually does not taste anything like watermelon? Yeah, not at all the case with their juice. It is like the very essence of the best watermelon you have ever tasted squeezed into a delicious nectar. I had to get a second cup on my way out."}
{"text":"The line takes forever and a day to get through and it's worth every single second. Every single thing that my party of four had was fantastic. I will be dreaming of the Brussels sprouts for days. The pita bread wraps were perfection. The sauces just right. I cannot wait to find a reason to go back."}
{"text":"My new favorite go-to restaurant for a quick healthy dinner with big enough portions to have leftovers for lunch!  I love the \"create your own bowl\" option and the staff was super helpful at explaining the ingredients. I wasn't sure if I wanted quinoa or cumin rice as the base of my bowl and when I asked which one is better, my servers response was \"why don't I give you a scoop of both and you tell me which one is better next time you come?\" which I thought was really nice (for reference i liked the rice better)! I also got the cucumber and tomato salad and chickpeas on top with falafel, hummus and tzatziki sauce.  My boyfriend got the rotisserie chicken plate and absolutely loved it. The mac and cheese and potatoes that he got as his sides were tasty and good complements to the chicken.   It is a bit of a hike from the uptown area but definitely worth the drive! If you are a fan of places like viva chicken and chipotle I recommend that you try Yafo as soon as possible.   It is also a good spot for a cheap date night: get your food to go, pick up a bottle of wine from winestore. next door and bring them home enjoy while watching a movie!"}
{"text":"Yafo serves great food and quality is nice. Waiting during peak hours is horrible. Maybe having another Payment system would help."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. A wide range of high quality food / ingredients. The customer service is good in that the people are very friendly; however, they seem to be generally disorganized behind the counter and it takes a long time to get through the line - if the line is long, expect a long wait (much slower than say Chipotle, for example). Overall, the food and atmosphere more than make up for some of the shortfalls in service. Please bring one of these to Southend - it would make a killing."}
{"text":"Frank Scibelli's had a ton of success with Charlotte restaurant concepts, but this is his best yet. So unique in that you can't find this type of food elsewhere. Ask for extra shag. The bread here is just so fresh, the mix of Mediterranean & Israeli inspired quick casual food will leave you wanting more."}
{"text":"Their food is so fresh, very flavorful, & the service is fantastic! This local restaurant is now one of my family's favorites for sure. We haven't tried anything we didn't like & highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Really really good!! Like a chipotle where you can choose what to put in your bowl. The staff weren't very friendly or helpful though, I had to continuously ask questions after telling them it was my first time there."}
{"text":"I admit I was a little skeptical before I came because of the higher price compared to other fast casual places but I'm a believer now. Long line at 2:15 on a Saturday gave me the feeling I was in for a treat. Built my own rice bowl with shawarma chicken which tasted fantastic and I'm stuffed after only being halfway finished with it. (Most meals come with warm lafa bread too) I also tried the cucumber lime mint drink which was delicious."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious!!! The falafel were airy and fluffy and so amazingly tasty, best one I have tasted in Charlotte!! They have fresh pitas that they make fresh there which were to die for. This place was really make great food and great atmosphere. I also loved that they had sides that were big, I got the cauliflower which was cooled perfectly. Def will be going back soon"}
{"text":"This has to be the freshest salad I've ever had. It's very filling! Price is right. Atmosphere very relaxing. I got the falafel bowl with all the toppings. It was DELICIOUS! All the fallacies marry together in your mouth. Makes for a great lunch or dinner. The staff is Very polite! The place is extremely clean. Great vegetarian and vegan options."}
{"text":"Came for the first time during a busy Sunday lunch rush. The guy at beginning of the line was helpful in explaining the different options. However, as I continued down the line I felt incredibly rushed and they seemed to lose track of my bowl and keep pushing it down the line since I ended up at the cash register without anyone asking if I wanted sauce. When I told the cashier I didn't get the chance to get any sauce they seemed very inconvenienced and rushed me to pay. The food was incredible which is the saving grace for the three stars I gave them."}
{"text":"I was here on Monday with two other colleagues for lunch. I love Mediterranean food and their half and half bowl was excellent. I chose the option of a hummus bowl mixed with a grain bowl. Their portion size was huge. I loved all the veggies. I selected their pickled onion in surmac, the roasted red peppers, and so much more. However, those two toppings really made my food so excellent. And the green dipping sauce they give you... oh my so delicious. The reason I did not give this a five star was due to the cashier checking us out. I hope that the restaurant manager reads this and looks back on the schedule for that day it was from the time frame 12:40pm. So we had a good bit of food left over and I asked the cashier for a to go box. She said \"Give me a second ma'am.\"Yes what she said was polite. However, the way she said it definitely had some attitude. And I understand she was busy ringing other people. So I politely just waited, and I felt horrible for even intruding. I mean if there was a designated area where you could just grab the to go boxes. Or if they placed it around their fountain drink area that would make the most sense. So she rang up two other customers and then she gave me the box and I walked off. Another person in my party went up and asked for to go boxes. She said the same thing. Another employee more towards the back side of the where the cashier was located I guess where they are prepping food provided with her to go box. She also mentioned that she felt like the cashier was rude. My suggestion, please provide a to go box area. Or just have a sign located to point where we could go to grab the to go boxes to avoid receiving attitude from a busy cashier."}
{"text":"Can't say I'm too sold on it. My friends raved about it figured I'd give it a try. I got it to go. Seasonings are good but I didn't realize the lamb was shredded when I got in. I also wasn't offered any sauces for dipping which I realized when I got home, may be my bad on that too. But by working there wouldn't you want to recommend something that pairs up with the meats or the bread? Eh. I may still to a hole in a wall spot instead."}
{"text":"So in general I am not a huge Mediterranean fan.  My girlfriend certainly is though so I thought I should give this place a try.  It is setup like most other fast casual places, you choose a wrap or a bowl and go from there.  I chose a wrap.  It comes in this wonderfully soft fluffy nan type bread.  You then get humus, tabouleh or babaganoush.  After that add your veggies, choose of meat, I got chicken and then choose a side.  A little pricey but very tasty and such a nice clean setting with very helpful people behind the counter.  I had no idea what I was doing and they guided me right through.  All in all, a really good dinner, even if you don't love this type of food, give them a try!"}
{"text":"A mix between Chipotle and Viva Chicken. Very good quality Mediterranean style food in a quick service format. They also have local brews on tap. Good place for a quick lunch or dinner.  I found the protein in my rice bowl to be cooler then I would prefer but the flavor was very good."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot in SouthPark. Fresh hummus, crunchy falafels and tasty roasted pepper salad are my favorites."}
{"text":"I heard the hype for several months before actually checking them out but when I finally did....AMAZING. This is truly the best fast, clean eats place I know. There are lots of fresh options including a combo bowl (salad, grain, and hummus) or chose one and load up on the toppings. I am a huge fan of the falafel, bread, and their rotating specialty drinks. I had the cucumber-mint limeade which was shockily good."}
{"text":"Lamb is heavily covered in sauce and what they call \"seasoning\" and the chicken has something on it but it was VERY dry...again they call it seasoning...it was more of a cover up.  The pita bread was dry and not tasty in my opinion. The prices are insane for fast food. $15 for a bowl and a side is ridiculous. There is also an upcharge for additional  toppings in color coded containers. Thats too expensive for that starving for business shopping center.  If you have allergies, dont dine here because they are not open to questions about ingredients. They will smile and rip you in the kitchen after answering your question.   Note: I only gave one star because you cant post without a rating. One star is far too generous."}
{"text":"Ok I must tell you I now wait to review a spot until I've had 3 visits at least AND THIS PLACE IS GREAT!!!!   Each visit was filled with friendly staff; fresh food; clean and bustling (meaning others like it as well as I do lol)   We usually do a CREATE YOUR OWN bowl with grains hummus (creamy and delish) tzatki (hope I spelled that right) followed by 3-4 of the toppings such as marinated beets, tomato cucumber relish; pickled onions and other deliciousness   The pita-ish bread is soft and chewy and wonderfully warm to accompany any order!     There are various meat and vegan toppers like falafel- lamb- grilled mushrooms - chicken ......  But let's talk their Shug sauce insanely simple (oil cilantro salt n pepper n garlic) but ohhhhh so good  I mean slather that stuff on everything y'all   They have an assortment of sweet or non sweet black and flavored teas and your basic fountain drinks   We don't live on this side of town and good thing as I'd find it hard not to keep this in heavy rotation"}
{"text":"Authentic and amazing food. Great experience and very nice workers. Great for vegans because vegan options are listed on the menu, but also great for nonvegans as well. Great first experience for people who have never tried mediterranean/middle eastern but also just as amazing as the real stuff. Highly recommend! Even my skeptical family all gave it a thumbs up."}
{"text":"We had the family dinner delivered thru Postmates. The app did not show a list of sides - a roast chicken comes with 3 sides and pita. They sent mac n' cheese which I do not usually like due to cheddar but this was delicious.  Brussel sprouts and hummus were also really YUM.  The chicken was not so good... very salty and I am not sure if it was great quality, vs. a Purdue type bird. .(I buy chicken from Whole Foods and Earthfare... ) From other reviews, I imagine something was off last night.)  Price was reasonable and pita was fresh and still warm.   Elijah, the driver was super nice!"}
{"text":"Wow, This place is refreshing from the moment you walk in. Cute atmosphere, neat location, KILLER food! The smell when you walk in AHHHHHHHHH. Ok so the food was 10 out of 10. I had a salad bowl build your own style. It was major flavor and healthy-ish . Meals arent cheap around (14 per), but they are worth EVERY penny. Make sure to try the pita bread its made fresh (in house) this is the best pita bread Ive ever had. Can I have my birthday party here? Hehee. The manager stopped by to check on us which to me is excellent care! I would go back for seconds if I could afford it lol. GO NOW! (RUN) and hit the wine shop up before or after to tatse a few YESSSSS"}
{"text":"I couldn't enjoy this place more. My boyfriend and I go here at least 2 times a month. It's definitely our lazy day dinner. I always go for the bowl and load it up with all my favorite goodies. This Greek restaurant is laid out in like a lunch line fast food style. Everything is fresh, everyone is nice, and all of it is so flavorful. You usually have so much of it you can save it for later too. I strongly recommend trying this place if you're ever stuck on what to get last minute, you'll get your food right away and as fresh as anywhere else."}
{"text":"Not that great. Couscous looks like it would have lots of flavor but it's pretty bland. They don't have gyros. Nothing really has much flavor which surprises me bc there's always a line there."}
{"text":"Food was great. Large portions and flavors were spot on. Went for lunch with a friend and everyone was so helpful with our two young children. Carried our trays to our table and got us high chairs. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely flawless experience and fabulous food! Shared an assortment of the mezze as appetizers- all were delicious! The rice with lentils and Brussels sprouts with dates were my two favorites. I also had the Marrakesh lamb which was flavorful and had tiny bit of kick.  We also had the pleasure of talking with the chef and the manager during our visit. It is clear that they are serious about making sure that everyone is happy with their experience.  I'm already plotting my next visit!"}
{"text":"So much flavor in the chicken Shawarma grain bowl. Add feta, and definitely keep the Schug sauce or whatever it is. My 16mo loved it, too. Very filling. My son's Mac n cheese was delicious, too. And that snickerdoodle cookie!  We can't wait to go back and try something new."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma bowl was delicious. This place exceeded my expectations and had good atmosphere. I would highly recommend this restaurant for lunch!"}
{"text":"Had the falafel wrap and my BF had the build your own bowl with chicken. He's a really picky eater and I'm a vegetarian but we both really enjoyed the food. Left full and satisfied. Staff is great and very welcoming. I got a noodle &co/chipotle vibe from the place but with better service and better food. Also their house hot sauce is HOT but a good compliment to the food. It doesn't come with the dishes but if you ask the staff will gladly give you more than enough"}
{"text":"I love this place. Good food, GREAT lamb, it doesn't even taste like lamb. Actually, Yafo changed my feelings on lamb, because the way they make it, you could tell me I wasn't eating something more familiar like beef or pork. Delicious. The variety of options and the well seasoned food keeps me coming back.   I have tried the Brussels sprouts as a side and they're amazing. Honestly, I think this is the only side I've tried, because .. well, if it ain't broke don't fix it, right?  I usually get the Marrakesh Lamb bowl because again, the lamb is amazing. This time I got 1/2 salad and 1/2 hummus as a base. Before I had grains.   Now the part I'm not happy with .. it's a little on the pricey side. $17 for lunch is a bit much IMO. I prefer to keep it around the $10 range. Get more for my $$. But I don't come here often, so I splurge every now and then. Fortunately I'm not feeding a family at that price."}
{"text":"I know this is blasphemous, but after my first visit to Yafo, I wasn't crazy about it. I went right at noon on a weekday and ordered one of their \"pre-set,\" signature bowls because, quite frankly, I was freakin' overwhelmed by the entire experience. From the minute I parked, I was confused... I tried to enter from a side door (right beside where I parked) but couldn't get in. Cue the hunt for the magic door. Once inside, I was greeted with a monstrously long line and super confusing menu. I wanted to ask the employees what they recommended, how all this Mediterranean magic worked, etc. but felt rushed because of the 20+ people waiting in line behind me. So, anyways. I ordered the Yafo Shawarma Bowl. It was OK. Nothing amazing. Nothing awful. I had to wait with tray in hand for a couple minutes until a table opened up. Faced another line to get a drink from the serve yourself fountains. I left not entirely impressed.   I say all that to highlight what a pleasant surprise my 2nd visit today was! Wanting to avoid the crowd, I showed up at 11:30am. Scored a parking spot right out front of the magic door. Things already looking up! When I walked in, there were a couple patrons seated, eating already and only one person in line. Happy day! I wandered up to the counter and stood, staring at the menu for a few minutes. It was so un-crowded, I even had time to stop and watch them making fresh Pita bread to the right of where you start your order. When I was finally ready to order, I was able to ask all sorts of questions as I built my own bowl! What do you prefer -- the cous cous or the rice? Can I have hummus AND babaganoush? Are those pickled onions? (They're sumac onions, btw.) What spices are in the beef? (They gave me a sample to try!) What sauce should I get? Yep. I was THAT girl but I regret nothing! Now that I've been able to take the time to get to know the concept and all the options, I'm in love with Yafo! My bowl was SO good and SO filing. And, let's talk about that pita for a minute! Soft and warm, buttery and salty. So delish! My creation was pretty pricey at $16 with a fountain drink. Service was so friendly, I felt obligated to leave a tip, too which brought my lunch total to $20. Don't get me wrong, the flavor and freshness is worth it, but I won't be able to afford to make Yafo a regular lunch spot at that price point. And, that makes me a little sad.   I'm happy to have discovered the secret to Yafo -- get there early and make your own bowl, taking the time to ask questions your first visit or two -- and looking forward to many future visits when I'm in the mood to splurge a little!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is delicious at a good price. Many selections on the menu and also many options for both teas soft drinks and local beer. Everyone seems to know what their job is and is extremely friendly. And it's healthy to boot. The Greek yogurt Mac and cheese is my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"Very good food here. There is always a long line. It feels like it's pricey. But after you finish eating. You really get a lot of food for the price.   I had the build your own bowl. I talked to the manager there and suggested they open one in Vegas.   It's a great place although it gets really crowded and people always bumping your chair trying to walk thru.  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Everything was so fresh and flavorful. I got half hummus and rice chicken bowl. Sooooo good! Also loved the cucumber lime tea!"}
{"text":"Everything was great. Quick service with the ability to see the kitchen as you walk the line. Staff was friendly and the food was very good."}
{"text":"We were told by 2 families that we should try this restaurant so we did. Now we're in the recommendation mode as the food was great and the staff was too."}
{"text":"I have now been here way too much that I have perfected my BYO bowl and have come to appreciate the high quality of the spreads. I mentioned that it's the Qdoba/Chipotle/Subway/Blaze of Mediterranean food before, but it's so much more than that. It's not just veggies or cheese that they throw on top. It's stuff that they make from scratch that's good enough to eat by itself. I need to get their recipe for the green sauce because I would put that on anything and everything. The last time I came here, I was feeling especially hungry and also got their falafel balls which were amazeballs."}
{"text":"Love the food, service is horrendous and also never gets the order right.  If they could fix the service and the pick up it would be awesome !"}
{"text":"Looking for a yummy lunch place to go to on your break? Yafo is a Mediterranean quick service with bold Middle-Eastern flavors. I feel like it is a required taste. They pride themselves on healthy food with an authentic taste. During lunch it gets very busy so I suggest getting there early or get it to go if you are on a time schedule. While you wait you are able to see them make there freshly made Baked Laffah which is basically a type of pita. When you get to where you order, you can get a signature dish or make your own. For the first experience I suggest trying one of their signature bowls so you figure out what you like. They also serve sides that you can get on top or on the side. The brussel sprouts were SO delicious. They give you a lot of food for the amount you pay. So don't be discouraged if its expensive. You will definitely have to take some to go."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Any restaurant that Frank Scibelli is involved with invariably is good.    Nice atmosphere and lots of great food choices.  Be warned. It gets busy at lunch so allow an extra 5 mins or so to wait it line"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! We loved everything we ordered. The Yafo Shawarma Wrap, mac n cheese,  rotisserie chicken, potatoes.... so tasty! The ordering processes could use some help. It's cafeteria style and the food didn't come as quickly as a cafeteria line demands but that can be overlooked because the food was so good. Will be back! Can't wait to try something new."}
{"text":"Near-perfect, almost as good as what I remember eating in Jerusalem. Fantastic selection of diverse items on their menu. It would be good for some of the daily sides to have more detailed descriptions (I was disappointed to realize that my Brussels sprouts were full of raw onion, which isn't my thing). And the hummus was a little salty for my liking. But the grilled chicken used in their dishes was spectacular and I can't wait to taste more of what they have to offer. Definitely a new favorite in the area - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to grab a quick bite to go or dine in. Don't let the relaxed, counter style fool you - all the food is full of flavor and you can taste the Mediterranean influence. I always go for the vegetable options- beets, brussel sprouts, and love that they have falafel, too! I'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"The people were nice and knew their menu, cashier was not very friendly. Menu is vague...nothing is labeled, we were told the items in the hot pots are mezzas and the people behind us in line were told everything was a mezza... Lettuce was brown and something used was soggy so i ended up with a bowl of soggy...sat outside where the music was so loud you couldn't have a conversation...and the coke was flat...so yeah not coming back for a $10 bowl of soggy"}
{"text":"Delicious! Love everything about this place. There hasn't been a single thing I've tried and didn't love! Their hummus is amazing as is the falafel. Mac n' cheese - to die for!"}
{"text":"I'm picky about Mediterranean and Middle Eastern restaurants. I'm Persian and I've had people rave to me about Mediterranean and Middle Eastern places multiple times and I'd ALWAYS be disappointed when I tried them. They were always a waste of money and I'd leave thinking eating at my parents' house is way better than that place.   Well, I came to the conclusion a long time ago that no restaurant is better than Mom and Dad's house, but Yafo Kitchen comes in second place! I'm so glad I listened to all the rave reviews and tried it today.  I went at 3:30 to get takeout and there were more people sitting there eating than you'd normally find at a restaurant at that time. There was no one waiting in line and the man behind the counter was helpful and excited when I said it was my first time eating there. He made me two samples of tahini and lemon herb vinaigrette. I wish I had tried the hummus also, but I completely forgot about it. I liked the tahini, but the lemon herb vinaigrette was just ok and I didn't order it.  I ended up building my own bowl with a base of Cumin Jasmine Rice, Tzatziki spread, Tomato, Cucumber. Tabbouleh, Purple Cabbage Slaw, Feta Cheese, Chickpea & Roasted Pepper Salad, Cucumber & Tomato Salad, Shawarma Chicken and Tahini just on the Shawarma Chicken.   The bowl was so yummy! I asked for more feta cheese twice and I appreciated not getting any sass or side eye from the employee about my triple feta, which was so worth it. My bowl was so ridiculously big that I couldn't figure out what was in the bowl that I didn't like since there was so much food. I think it was the tabbouleh or the purple cabbage slaw.   I'm all about getting multiple meals out of takeout and I definitely did with this bowl. You also get a side of pita bread (something else I'm picky about since I'm Middle Eastern) and it was delicious. The base of cumin jasmine rice was good too and it definitely didn't taste like boxed rice - I'm sure they use a rice cooker!   The rave Yelp reviews and a recommendation from a friend who said I had to get it made me order the greek yogurt mac & cheese, which was some of the best mac & cheese I've ever had! I highly recommend everyone try it. I'll never go back to Yafo Kitchen again without ordering it.  I can't wait to come here again and try out more items on the menu, especially the falafel and hummus. This place is a little pricier than Chipotle as a takeout option, but is well worth it! I'm excited they are opening another location this summer."}
{"text":"Very happy about the new wave in healthy and fast Mediterranean food that's sweeping the country right now. Like Cava in DC and Naf Naf in Chicagoland, Yafo takes on the Chipotle \"customize it how you like it with fresh ingredients\" model with Mediterranean favorites. Choose from grains, salad, or hummus bowls (you can choose 2 if you want) and the variety of spreads, veggies and grilled meats. I loaded on every single free topping that I could! My only cuisine gripe is that the laffah pita gets hard as soon as it cools. If you are able to avoid the lunchtime rush-DO THAT. Because it's so choose-your-own it can take a while to get through the line. Even still, you'd wait that or more at a traditional sit down place, so no biggie.    The staff goes above and beyond to be helpful. I came in with a dying phone battery and they carried all my food and drinks and keys to the one booth with an accessible outlet. I would have given 4 stars for wait time and lack of seating area to accommodate the crowd (I felt especially bad for monopolizing the only outlet booth as a solo diner), but an extra star is warranted for the friendliness!"}
{"text":"Very delicious and tons of different options. I enjoyed everything that I ate, and even had plenty leftover for lunch too! The pita, rice, meat, and sides were great (I had the Brüssel sprouts and Mac and cheese and they were amazing)."}
{"text":"I haven't ever returned to Yafo because of the location, but today we decided to have it brought to us via Postmates and I fell in love with the food again.  Oh my gosh, it's just so fresh and tasty!  My  delivered experience was SO much better than my in person experience.  No chalk boards to read, nothing to try to figure out, no sliding a tray or getting my own drinks, and certainly no fighting that parking lot!  There was simply no comparison- today's postmated Yafo experience was 10 times better and I will repeat it  :-)  ATTENTION YAFO:  PLEASE OPEN A LOCATION IN THE STEELE CREEK - RIVERGATE AREA!  There is no competition for you in the Steelcreek area (beyond Showmars, which is not the same business model), and we really need a better Mediterranean option  :-)"}
{"text":"I had hummus, baba ghanouj, Brussel sprouts, and beets with pistachios.  They were all very good and the flat bread that came with it was excellent. But, my iced tea was $3, which should be a crime."}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthy option to go to for dinner with one of my girl friends.  She suggested Yafo. I had been to Yafo before and didn't have a good experience, so I was anxious to give it another shot especially with the incredible reviews.  I ordered half hummus, have quinoa, with chicken, cucumber, feta, and chickpeas.  There was some delicious taziki sauce drizzled on top.   I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious this bowl was.  I also ordered the cucumber green drink that was really refreshing and delicious.  I wish Yafo published their nutrition because I can't tell how many calories I ate.   I will return."}
{"text":"Yafo is a solid experience. I don't know that \"Yafo\" means solid experience - I just mean that it's some seriously good food. I also know that you absolutely should not go at lunchtime, because the place is packed. The tables are packed. The line to order is packed. This is not where you go for the five minute lunch special when you're in a hurry.  The advantage, however, is that you get to check out the menu, which is important, especially on your first time (perhaps your first few times), as it is certainly a unique offering. I do not say this in a bad way - I say it because you likely have not seen anything like Yafo before. I mean you've seen Subway (or some variation). You've seen Chipotle (or some variation). You have probably even seen Zablong (or some variation). Get the idea?  Yafo, however, is a bit... different. Unique and different do not equate to bad - it just means different. While most people are probably useful to the regular options on most menus, the menu at Yafo can be a bit challenging. Do you order a grain bowl? What is a grain bowl? Do those things go together? Who knows? The good news is that it's all pretty tasty, so it really doesn't matter much, and the even better news is that the serving is so big that you'll likely have leftovers. and those leftovers taste even better after sitting in the fridge staring at you to eat them.  So while a bit confusing, and challenging to park, enter, order and yes, perhaps even eat, just go for it - throw everything you think you might want in that bowl and start eating. It's worth it. Just avoid the busy times, if you can."}
{"text":"I struggle to give it a three today. I have been here many times and it is always excellent, today seems like the manager either was not there or not paying attention, the line staff could not get the order right twice, and the cashier was distant,rude and seemed like she not only disliked her job ,but the customers as well.  The three stars is strictly for the food which is always excellent, the negative review primarily hinges on the cashier. Line staff getting the order wrong was not that big of a deal it happens. But the cashier is the last and main point of contact with the customer, she made no eye contact, did not smile, and when I asked for extra hummus and Laffa bread (which I had requested at the start of the line when I initially placed my order) I asked the cashier twice and the second time (since she failed to even look at me the first time and acknowledge she heard me)I asked someone down line and then the cashier, again without even looking at me, said in a very rude and aggravated tone \"I heard you\". When I finally paid the bill she flipped the screen over and said \"sign this\" which I did, she then turned away and never even said thank you. Unfortunately this is the impression I left with, A place with degrading service, unhappy employees, and not caring at all  I will try it again, because the food is really good and typically the service is excellent. Perhaps this is just a bad day. Really wish the manager had been anywhere near the cash register ,as I would've addressed this to Management directly, but if the manager was anywhere nearby, they certainly did not make their presence known or pay attention to the cashiers attitude and behavior.  I responded to the email from your first customer service representative this morning since no phone number was furnished, I received no response at all as of 6:12 PM today, once again serious customer service issue here when the home-office doesn't even respond to their own request...  5/6/18 After hearing from their main office and providing them a copy of the check and a full description of the people (which they requested), I have never heard back from them, no offer of a complimentary drink or anything of that sort.  Very disappointed, if that is the attitude of the home-office, it is understandable that the service is degrading at this location. If there is that sort of lack of caring about keeping a customer, you can only imagine how the employees must feel. So to sum it up, the food is good, the service is degrading, and the home-office has a laissez-faire attitude towards it all"}
{"text":"I keep coming back to Yafo every couple of months and wishing there was one closer in North Charlotte! Their meals are so fresh, flavorful and filling! I typically order the Shawarma bowl w/tzatziki, hummus, feta, tomatoes and cucumbers and tahini dressing over rice. I tell myself every time I will not finish my bowl and have leftovers and every time I am wrong. I will say the rotisserie chicken and feta are both salty but it all balances out in the end with the remainder of the toppings. If you're on the fence, give it a go! Would make an excellent meal to go, not that I will ever find out. Pro tip: make sure you ask for the schug!"}
{"text":"5 stars! I have been meaning to visit Yafo for the last year, but I never \"got around to it.\" Well I am kicking myself now. This is an amazing place! I absolutely love the concept. I don't think there are many resturaunts in Charlotte that fill the void in this food space and I am so glad that Yafo has answered our prayers.   Where do I even begin at how amazing this place is? Well first, there will be a line, but let me assure you, its worth waiting for. While in line, make sure to check out the staff making homemade pita. They create the dough, knead the dough, and fire it in the oven right before your eyes. Choose your base, protein, toppings, sauce, and any sides. There are so many choices, and you know what? I don't think you can make a bad choice. Don't fret about worrying what will go together with what, it will all taste amazing no matter the combination. My favorites are the hummus, lamb, chicken, and sauces. The falafel is delicious and make sure to try the pita! It is the softest, and airiest pita you will ever eat! The portions are huge. Its big enough to share or you can bring home enough for another meal. This is now my new favorite place in Charlotte. Well done Yafo!"}
{"text":"Awesome concept in the South Park area! Walk in pick your bowl or wrap or rotisserie chicken, select the toppings and sides and enjoy. I've been twice during this past holiday season and depending on the day or time, the line could be out the door. Fortunately, it's fast casual enough to where you can find a seat by the time you get your food. The portions are hefty even if the price is a bit high (if you add meat). But you can get some healthy or non-healthy options to fulfill the Mediterranean cravings.  Managers seem to check on you in the dining room and have all been very nice to make sure you got what you need. Interior is clean, open and vibrant. The flavors aren't as deep as Jasmine Grill on South Boulevard, but the ambience, service, and area trump it."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Yafo Kitchen in my visit today! There was a very long line when I arrived in the heart of the lunch rush at 12:30, but they worked pretty efficiently, and I was still through the line in 10 minutes or so. I got a half hummus/half rice bowl, and the food was amazing! Everything tasted fresh and high quality. The chicken, rice, hummus, and tzatziki sauce all tasted great individually, and all of the toppings/mezzes were tasty. The laffah bread was warm, soft, and exactly what you'd want. You can see the chicken on the rotisserie and the laffah bread being backed in house, which is awesome. I only tried the chicken, but my friend said the lamb was excellent as well. The prices are a bit steep for fast casual, but the portion for my bowl was very large after adding toppings and a protein as well. I'd definitely recommend giving Yafo a shot, especially if you can come at a time that wouldn't be super busy."}
{"text":"I'm going to go ahead and say it - Yafo is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  Every time I go, I find myself setting at the table and taking that first bite and just dying with happiness.  We visited Yafo Kitchen in its opening weeks and watched the head chef working tirelessly to make things happen - we were impressed.  That feeling has never faced.  The ingredients always taste (and look) fresh, the combinations you can make offer more variety than you could imagine, oh and it helps that they give you free bread and don't judge when I mispronounce things and have to make requests like \"yeah, the purple one? Thank you!\" It doesn't seem so strange to be a vegetarian, vegan or anything else here.  This is our GO TO spot when bringing non plant based family members out to eat, too.  I can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"A great concept!!!  Food was very good and lots of tasty choices! I look forward to going back!!! Nice job Yafo!"}
{"text":"My years of food adventures in Charlotte have taught me this: if Frank Scibelli is involved, it's going to be amazing, delicious, and will live up to the hype.   Yafo Kitchen is a fast casual type concept, but way elevated. A focus on fresh, quality, and local ingredients. If you're wondering why it costs a little more than other fast casual places, this is why. It's totally worth it. I mean, they even fresh squeeze the lemon juice. Authentic, daily made from scratch bread (you can watch them make the laffa there in house), spreads, and juices (seriously, skip the sodas and pay more for one of these). And, THEY HAVE THE GOOD ICE. They also have local beers.   My problem is that I like everything here, so ordering is a struggle for me. I love all the sides. If I build a bowl of some sort, I end up basically adding every topping possible. The portion sizes are generous. I can usually make two meals out of a bowl. Don't be afraid to ask questions. The menu can be a little bit intimidating. Everyone here is nice and will explain it all to you.   It can get pretty crazy here for lunch, so plan accordingly. There will be a line. It does move fairly quickly. I recommend off-peak times or ordering online for take out."}
{"text":"No doubt authentic, fresh, delicious and incredible staff!  Frank Scibelli and Executive Chef Shai Farrigan have created and extraordinary fast casual place to eat and enjoy great food for lunch, dinner and any setting family business and friends!!!"}
{"text":"Why do I crave Yafo Kitchen all the time???  Maybe because it's delicious maybe cause it healthy!!! Plus It's really close to work so I can pop in anytime.   Now when you come in might be overwhelming looking at the menu board, the employees on the line and the cooking process going on in the background but take your time. It's very simple. They will also let you sample anything on the line.   I'm in love with their mezzes. My faves are the creamy Greek Yogurt Mac and Cheese and the Roasted Cauliflower. If I'm not that hungry I grab those two for lunch and will be completely satisfied. Now if I'm trying to get 2 meals out of one order than I get the create your own options. I'm normally a half grain half salad type of girl however today I chose the half hummus half salad option. It was soooo delicious!!! I added shawarma chicken as my protein and tahini on top. I always get the purple cabbage slaw, the pickled sumac onions, pickles, feta, the chick pea red pepper salad and the quinoa salad. I tried the black kalamata olives once and they were too salty for me. I also really like the green Schug sauce they have on the side. You have to request it. It's amazing and really add a lot of flavor to your bowl.   I rarely eat inside but always take it to go. The meal really holds up well and I'm able to eat part for like lunch and save half for dinner. All of the employees have been helpful and really know the menu.

{"text":"It is everything the other reviewers said it would be. We went for a late lunch. The macaroni and cheese was to die for.  The food is fresh and delicious. We left so full we never ate dinner that night. The only draw back was I wanted a cold beer and it was all warm."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about Yafo, I was excited to finally try it out this past weekend. And I was blown away.  My boyfriend and I were looking for a fresh option after a hard workout, and Yafo really hit the spot. I love the build-your-own concept, especially because you can do a \"Half and Half Bowl\" which makes it easier to choose between salad, grain, hummus, etc. The staff were extremely accommodating and even let me do a \"Thirds Bowl\" with baba ghanoush, hummus, and salad.  All of the toppings were really delicious, although it's easy to rack up quite the bill due to additional add-ons for certain items. It gets above the $10 mark quickly, but I thought the food was better than any sit-down restaurant in the $$ range here in Charlotte. The laffah bread served with your bowl is mouth-watering AMAZING and I couldn't get over the wonderful combo of flavors in my bowl. All the ingredients tasted fresh and nourishing, but I was still very stuffed afterward.  I can't wait to go back and try more combinations here. The value and quality is unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Very nice fast food Mediterranean concept. Efficient for lunch hours during working days or simply when you want to eat good and grab to go. I really enjoyed their hummus and their bowl concept is very unique for this type of food and Mediterranean culture. Their choices for combos are really good. I love they have options for vegans and meat eaters. Their hummus and pita bread is really good. They have a couple of rice options and even quinoa. Just be careful if you go with the option of \"create your own\" when creating your bowls, unless you like messy wet food you don't want to end up with a base of two large scoops of hummus and tahini sauce mixes at the bottom of your bowl and then have your rice, meat, lettuce soaked in it, unless you like hummus soup. My friend went for that option and then didn't want it as the bowl couldn't hold the drip of wetness and honestly it did look kind of nasty. But that's not a restaurant issue that's your choice, so don't say I didn't give you safe tips!  prices are good and quality too. I recommend."}
{"text":"I literally LOVE this place! It is always packed for good reason. Super healthy and individualized as you create your own super bowl of color and health! So many ingredients to choose from and at reasonable prices for lunch. Service is always friendly and efficient! I am so pumped they are adding one in the Southend area!"}
{"text":"Not authentic Mediterranean food , I had better Mediterranean food. Really not recommending."}
{"text":"1st time there. Food very refreshing but a little confusing. The wrap has way way too many carbs so if you are following the O diet stay away from the wrap. The veggies and lamb was great. I'm chickened out. Give me some tofu but not chicken."}
{"text":"So. Good. Get the half and half quinoa and hummus bowl and your life will be changed. Think chipotle burrito bowl, but a better mediterranean version.   It's a bit expensive, but you get enough food for two meals. And it's super fresh. And it's just that good."}
{"text":"We have been to this place multiple times, the food is very good and the laffah is like a soft pillow. The chicken and falafel are very good. The reason for three stars is for service. Most of the staff are friendly but some folks behind the counter behave as if they are serving the food for free. The only thing they need to do as far as communication is talk but some of them just think they need not interact with you and keep moving away from the customer even before asking if the customer wants anything more. This was not during a rush hour and we usually go there for dinner around 8.."}
{"text":"The falafel wrap is amazing. They give you TONS of food. I also recommend the house drinks that they serve. The line can get backed up but they usually move quickly."}
{"text":"Such a great fast-casual place!  When I moved here I was looking for a place like this and I am glad to discover it exists!  Love the bowl option with grains as the base and all of the toppings!  Gives me enough food for leftovers!"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious and the staff is very welcoming and attentive!  We even got a free truffle after our dinner.  Will definitely be on my top 10 local dinner spots!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on Tuesday. The food was fast, easy, healthy and amazing. If you like middle eastern food, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"More like Blahfo Kitchen.   While the food isn't necessarily bad, I certainly don't get the hype either.  I've been here twice now.. Once about a year ago and once yesterday. Both times I've opted for the Build Your Own Bowl with Half Salad and Half Hummus. My first visit I added falafel as my protein and remember not being too impressed by it. Yesterday I was stupid enough to add it again. The falafel is some of the blandest, driest chickpea fritters I've ever tried. It was comparable to the disappointing falafel I had at Maoz in NYC a few years back. Not impressed. I will say that the hummus was very good & the salad was very fresh. They have an interesting variety of toppings & I've added pickled onions, olives, a chickpea mixture, & a tomato/cucumber mixture to my bowl both times, with some lemon herb vinaigrette. It's kinda dumb that the toppings aren't labeled so you just have to point at everything when you order. Also that's probably why the line can get so long. I'm sure it gets backed up because customers have questions about the ingredients, etc. Most of it is pretty good though & I can get a couple of meals out of my bowl. I do also like the laffah bread that's served on the side. It's pillowy and warm. Their falafel still sucks though.   Also their \"mezzes\" annoy me for some reason. First because you don't know what they are until you get up to the counter. Second because they have stuff like mac & cheese as a mezze (really??) but no stuffed grape leaves! What's a Middle Eastern/Greek restaurant without that as a mezze! I get that they can serve whatever they want on their menu but I'm just surprised those were left out.   I'm sure I'll be back but only if a friend suggests it and shoots down my other ideas first. I just need to remember to never add the falawful!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit to Yafo Kitchen immensely. Everything looked wonderful but with a bit of encouragement from the fellow behind the counter, I went with the special of the day- stuffed cabbage. Like so much of the food at Yafo, this is something I grew up on. It was superb. Hearty, comforting and delicious. For my side, I chose the mac and cheese which was also fantastic. I was with my sister and brother in law and sampled some of what they had, and it was all great.  It seems like you can't go wrong with whatever you choose here. If I lived or worked nearby, I would be a regular.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Extremely good!   All the items were full of flavor.  Only issue was the long line, service was fast, just a really popular place."}
{"text":"Holy crap, this place is fantastic!! How I have never been here is beyond me. So much to choose from..everything is fresh ..tons of sauces to dip stuff in...service is great..Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I don't see what everyone is raving about. I got 3 of their best side dishes. The Mac and cheese, Brussels, & cauliflower. The mac and cheese was good but nothing special, the cauliflower was bland and the Brussels weren't crispy but soggy.  It was a good portion for the price, but the line at lunch time is ridiculous.   I'll probably be back because of coworkers, but not a regular."}
{"text":"Oh my YUM! Wish I'd found this place sooner..... solid portions and it was delicious and fresh. Our 7-year old devoured his Mac & cheese with chicken and hubs and I enjoyed our meals (avocado with chicken & quinoa). It can be a little stressful as you need to know what you want or the line gets frustrated behind you. Someone else compared it to a Greek chipotle & that's exactly right. It's loud, so when it's packed don't expect to ask questions or get suggestions but just about anything you get is tasty! We even got a side of falafels with some tzatsiki and it was devoured in seconds ... this is a great place for a weekend lunch stop for sure."}
{"text":"After hearing all the buzz about Yafo Kitchen, we decided to stop here for dinner one evening while shopping in SouthPark.  Yafo is a fast casual place, where they prepare the food in front of you.  The menu is pretty extensive--with lots of options--so I'd suggest previewing it online so you're better prepared for your order.    I got the falafel wrap.  It's served on their homemade (and delicious!) laffah bread with one large side.  I got the couscous, which had an interesting spice that I liked very much.  At $10.99, it's a little more than I usually pay for a falafel wrap, but it was so delicious that I have no doubt I'll order this again.  My husband got the six mezze plate, since he wanted to try a variety.  He got the hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouleh, beets with goat cheese, cumin rice, tzaziki, and of course, laffah.  The portions are pretty large, and we could have split fewer mezze dishes.  His favorites were the hummus, rice, tabbouleh, and tzaziki.  And I loved the tzaziki on my falafel wrap!  I hope they open another location soon in Lake Norman!  Until then, we'll keep coming to this location."}
{"text":"It was so good! I highly recommend this place best part is we found it by accident! We don't live in NC but we will def be back cause we visit Charlotte frequently"}
{"text":"I would give it 10 stars if I could. I went a few weeks ago and have been back 4 times since. (And meeting a friend there today for lunch) everything I've tried is great. Chicken Shawarma is soooo good!!   The grain bowls are delicious. Mac and cheese and roasted cauliflower are awesome."}
{"text":"This is a split review as I really liked Yafo.  The chef is an Israeli who opened up his own restaurant in the US. We were in Israel (tel aviv) last spring and an Israeli told us he is a wonderful chef and had a restaurant in Tel Aviv until he came tot he US..  I really liked it and you can combine proteins like lamb, kibbeh, etc with all the wonderful salads, baba, and a huge variety of other things along with some nice beers.  I would definitely go back.  My husband on the other hand gave it a 2 and did not like it.  I think he was spoiled by the Israeli food and did not think it was authentic enough.  I will go back though."}
{"text":"Customer service was awful. Everyone had attitudes. The food was also not very flavorful. I won't be going back here."}
{"text":"Super fresh.Fast. Casual. Great patio seating and really delicious Greek create your own entree dining. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I only came here to get baba ghanoush for take out.  It was delicious!  Service was great.  The menu looked really extensive and tasty.  It was almost a little overwhelming with many tempting dishes.  I will definitely be back to try more!  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Fast, clean and such a wide and interesting variety of foods. I love \"one bowl meals\" and there are so many ways to satisfy that itch here! Great customer service and attention as well. Yum, will definitely be back when in Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I'm slightly sad that I've waited this long to check out Yafo Kitchen, because it was delicious and I will certainly be back again!   Coming at the peak of lunch time and being my first time was slightly overwhelming, so I'd recommend checking out the menu online prior to, just so you have an idea. I went for the half and half BYOB, and I'm glad I did because I was able to try a little bit over everything. Their hummus is delicious and smooth, and their taziki has that tangy cool texture you want. I'm not vegan, but I chose the falafel, and I'm glad I did, they were delicious! The bread that you get with the oil/herb sauce on the side helps to scoop up all the goodness in the bowl, getting all the delicate Mediterranean flavors!   Parking can be a little tricky in the center, so just find a spot and take a stroll!"}
{"text":"I'm Middle Eastern & I'm IMPRESSED!  I fell in love with this place and so glad they opened in Charlotte!  Some of the best falafel I've ever tasted, and their kufta & chicken are seasoned so well.  Their couscous is outstanding and all of their ingredients are fresh.  I am a regular for life...this is a WINNER!  Thank you!!!!!"}
{"text":"great review of this new place in charlotte agenda on monday so 16 yr old daughter and i went to try it out. i wanted to love it. i got to meet Frank Scibelli, the owner. I have always liked his other restaurants. i ended up just liking it. I thought it was a little odd that no side items come with it. i ordered the marrakesh lamb wrap for $12.99. the flavor was good. it would just be nice to have a little scoop of rice or couscous as a side. daughter ordered a wrap and ordered a side of rice and it was 2.99 for a side of rice. a little pricey for what you get.  we came up to the door on the Earth Fare side and it was locked. we had to walk through the patio construction to get to the unlocked door.  lastly, to get from the dining room to the restroom, you have to walk through the people waiting in line to order. it would have made more sense to put the restroom in the dining room area. the food is good, worth a try."}
{"text":"Had a really straight forward and pleasant experience here for lunch. This is the typical pick your ingredients style order process much like a subway. However, the ingredients are really high quality and diverse. I got a quinoa bowl with falafel, veggies, and the mint dressing. There also appeared to be some unique drink options, but I just had water. There were tons of vegan and gluten free options available, which is great to see. The freshly made bread was amazing when warm but got oddly hard and tough as it sat. We lingered for a hour or more but I am still not sure why the bread became tough and almost stale in such a short period. Overall, it is absolutely worth a repeat visit but I may ask them to hold the bread next time."}
{"text":"Holy Toledo!! This is so good!! Half and half grain bowl with shawarma and fallafel with a side dish of cauliflower (which I swear tastes like French fries)!! My second time eating here, and I love it. A little pricey for my budget, but so worth it."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Yafo Kitchen after moving to Charlotte from Florida. I love it!! The food and all of their different teas/lemonades. So good!! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE YAFO! This place has generous portions, delicious food, and a clean and inviting atmosphere.     They do get super busy and this \"fast casual\" place can turn just casual (because the line is out the door and it's no longer fast), so avoid peak times if possible. If I'm coming here for lunch, I try to arrive before 11:30 and if I'm coming for dinner I try to arrive before 6.   My favorite is the build your own bowl. I order it to-go even when I plan on dining in as the portion is large enough that I ALWAYS have leftovers. I do the half Romain, half rice bowl and I pack that thing full with cucumbers, tomatoes, hummus, pickled onions, falafel, tahini, and more. Each bowl also comes with a huge piece of pita bread.   They have great family style options, which makes this place a great deal for groups. They also have indoor and outdoor seating. I love their food and the service is always great as well!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, their lamb is absolutely phenomenal & their hummus is melt in your mouth creamy. I can say I am not a fan of the their chicken but that's pretty much the only thing I haven't liked there. The Mac n cheese when you catch them busy and it's fresh is bomb!! && don't get me started on the sautéed Brussel spouts. Yum yum yum"}
{"text":"There is too much to say about this place. So let's sum it up by saying, just do yourself a favor and go! I have yet to try something I don't like here, and everyone we send comes back just as thrilled as we are. This is literally one of our favorites in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Simply amazing Middle Eastern food. We went on a weekday and even at 2 PM there was a long queue, that tells how good the food is. The chief attendant was very polite and courteous and made sure we were comfortable, he brought the highchair for our daughter before we even had to ask for it.  Good hygienic tasty Middle Eastern food with moderate pricing"}
{"text":"Loveeeee the food and service!! I'm a vegan and always looking for a place for my girlfriend a (meat eater) can have dinner together. Where I don't have to just order fries and a salad. It's a little expensive, but worth it!!"}
{"text":"Been trying to stop in for awhile and yesterday we did. It was different.  Very fast pace in ordering process. The kid behind counter was getting frustrated but who cares. It was our fist time in and Probably the last.  We had shawarma Baba ghanouj and falafel. The food really didn't taste all that.  Seems like it was fresh but had better tasting in other places. Well I guess I'll cross this place of the list."}
{"text":"It's the newest hot spot in the South Park area!  I've had various people tell me to check this place out.  I finally did for a lunch adventure.  Luckily, I came with someone who has been here before, and we came before the lunch crowd which starts around 12pm on the weekend.  I was overwhelmed (in a good way) by all the options and choices you have.  I ended up getting a half rice and half lettuce bowl.  Then you choose from a bunch of different ingredients to add.  I tried it all and added some chicken at the end.  The bowl you get is huge, but it was so good that I ate it all.  The staff that work there are super nice and helpful too.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Another twist on Mediterranean food -- YaFo does not disappoint. Went there for the first time today for lunch and the line was REALLY long. The prices are a bit high for lunch to get a bowl of all the things I really wanted (addon $ for Steak, hard boiled eggs, beets, avocado, etc) so I opted this time for the Mezze x4. Mezze gives you 4 little bowls of cold and/or hot items (not including meat). I ordered beets, potatoes, brussels and falafel for 9.99 which you select as you walk through to pay. This option had generous portions and all of the food was super duper good :) - especially the potatoes & sprouts. I really liked this place but will come @ 11:30 next time."}
{"text":"Great food - lots of healthy options. Subway/Chipotle style ordering where you walk the line and get your food made to order."}
{"text":"After seeing a review about Yafo on Charlotte Agenda and then realizing that it is close to home, it quickly jumped to the top of our list of places to eat. We went in today for a late lunch,  it was an odd time of day so it was fairly quiet inside. We were greeted by several friendly faces. Decor is nice with a modern edge to it, very clean inside (including the food prep line), and the patio appears that it will be a wonderful addition once complete.  The gentlemen that took our orders and assembled our meals were very polite, a little shy still, but informative about any questions regarding menu items. I ordered the Sabich which comes with (among many other delicious things) a tomato mixture, they had currently run out of the mixture and were very apologetic, so they offered to add more of another ingredient which was just fine with me! The Sabich was delicious!! The flavor combinations were brilliant. It is large and packed full of wonderful and obviously fresh ingredients. It comes with a side, today I chose the rice mixture that had a mildly spicy oil-based cilantro sauce. My boyfriend opted to build his own wrap, which also comes with a side. There are plenty of ingredients to choose from leading his wrap to be of generous portion as well, which he thoroughly enjoyed.   After we had chowed down on every bite of our meal we had a lovely surprise, Chef Shai Fargian stopped by our table. He offered complimentary Nutella Truffles and personally greeted us. He asked how they did today and what they could do better and chatted for a couple of minutes. 1) It speaks volumes of how much pride he has in his food to personally approach customers 2) He is a super friendly man whom is very skilled in his trade and 3) We advised him that we honestly could not think of anything to do better, the whole experience was lovely and the food was amazing. Somehow we mentioned how many rave reviews we have heard about Yafo's hummus and how much my boyfriend enjoyed it on his wrap. We were pleased to hear how they hand make the hummus in-house from organic chickpeas and how he said it was one of the restaurants \"labors of love\".  Super great gentleman who made this afternoon dining experience even better. And just so you know the truffles were killer, so good!  So come in and grab a meal at a place you can enjoy many options, including Vegan and Vegetarian, and not have to sacrifice flavor or the amount of ingredients. You can even have a fresh made juice/lemonade or beer- they have some on tap and some canned options. We will definitely be back, there's nothing like being able to grab a meal that you trust to be fresh and made from ingredients you would actually buy for your own home. A+! :)"}
{"text":"So amazing. Very fresh, and clean. In a very nice walking mall area near Southpark Mall."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from some of friends and finally visited! It was around lunch time and the line for order was kinda long. But it didn't take long for my turn to order.  I ordered their signature marrakesh lamb bowl. As this is my first time, I was a little confused. Their signature menu looks what will be included for the bowl. But the staff asked me what kind of ingredients I want to add. I chose a couple and it turns out 'my own dish', not a marrakesh lamb bowl.   I don't know if their system is like this(Even though I chose the fixed menu and I can still add some of ingredients?)or there is a miscommunication with staff. Anyway, the lamb was tender and all the ingredients were fresh. I just didn't like the combination I chose. Better try their signature bowl next time. Their lime mint drink was very refreshing and goes well with any dishes. Good place for healthy eating!"}
{"text":"So good! Really really good! We went on a Friday night around 8:00 figuring they wouldn't be too busy and boy, were we wrong! We waited in line for 20 minutes. Being that this was our first time, we didn't exactly know what to expect. I felt alimony as if we were in line to eat at a cafeteria. We looked at the menu while in line and kept changing our minds as to what to order. One negative is that they do not have their sides- or mezzes as they call the listed. So one we got up to order, we had to ask what they had for mezze and they answered us with the response that everything is considered a mezze. That caused us to hold up the line longer and that was a bit of a negative to me. Who wants to make a rushed decision in ordering food?? Our food was well with the wait but costly. We paid $60 for four of us to eat and that is without alcohol. After standing in a cattle call line and cafeteria style service, that's a hard pill to swallow for a quick service restaurant!!  Will we return? Sure, but I think that we will be more vigilant as to what we are ordering so we don't have another crazy bill."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mediterranean place in Charlotte. It's better than good, it's great. Build your own bowl and get creative. Always add on beets and don't skip on the Brussel sprouts either. Yafo sweetens the Brussels with dates and they are Devine. If you have time grab a glass of wine with dinner. The service is ALWAYS cheerful and helpful and the line moves quick. It will become a staple in your life once you've had it!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise this restaurant turned out to be.  I was definitely skeptical since franchise ethnic food tends to be average and not authentic.  The food was excellent and the bread was made by hand as we waited in line.  I had the salad bowl with lamb, my husband had the salad bowl with the spiced beef, my son had the mac n cheese with chicken, and we ordered a side of falafel.  Every dish was well spiced, full of flavor, and held up to authentic dishes we've had elsewhere.  I would definitely visit again and actually really like the concept of the cafeteria line once we tried it."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh, the long line is for a reason but worth the wait. Prices are reasonable and friendly staff.  Not a bad item on four of our plates. Watermelon and cucumber waters very tasty.  Falafel, schwarma wrap was delectable."}
{"text":"I dig this place.  The line was long and it didn't move quickly at all but it was worth the wait in my opinion.  I have tried the hummus bowls and I usually add some type of chicken/protein.  My sister had the lamb and said it was delicious.  I add the fresh tomato/cucumber salad, some quinoa, and feta and enjoy!  The naan, pita, or whatever it is that comes with every meal is delightful!  So soft and fluffy and warm and delicious.    Prices are fair.  Food is fresh.  Service is friendly.  Good options on the menu.  Healthy options.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I was thrilled after my first visit but I still get this happy feeling every time I make it here. The hummus is simple and it's my favorite hummus of all Charlotte. The falafel should be available in popcorn size tubs from the movie theatre. It's divine and packed with great flavor. I love the sprinkled salt on it too!  It is definitely addicting for me!  I enjoy this place because I'm such a picky eater and I basically want everything. Yafo lets me choose any \"mezzes\" combination. I mean you can get their Greek yogurt Mac and cheese as a side along with the healthy choices of roasted cauliflower, mixed veggies, and their soup du jour. The lemon chicken and shredded lamb are moist and tender and goes great with the bowls.  I have to try their wraps along with the Shwarma. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I discovered Yafo on a Saturday and have been three times already - today is Monday :) You are getting quality ingredients, delicious flavors and all around fresh food. I've tried their salads, grain bowls with their shwarma chicken, rotisserie chicken and mezze plates - all delicious! Their laffah bread is soft and a great compliment to the meal. For the mezze plates, we've tried tzatiki, hummus, Brussels sprouts, mac n cheese, and falafel. I can't get enough of their Brussels sprouts and tzatiki! My kids ate up the Mac n cheese and bread.  We ordered pb&j too for the kids once, and I'm not sure it worked so well because it came on their laffah/pita bread. I'm not sure the combo worked and it was difficult for the kids to hold and eat. They also serve chicken nuggets and a rice bowl. My kids enjoyed some of our Yafo shwarma rice bowl. I wish they served milk - if you have a kids menu, you should serve milk too! Overall, great quality and service. The food is fresh and delicious, and portions are great. You order your food, watch them make it, pay and seat yourself. The place is clean (bathrooms are updated and clean) and they've got staff turning around tables fairly quickly. It gets pretty crowded so they may need to set up some outdoor seating.  Follow up review: we revisited Yafo at around 4:30pm. The place was empty due to the odd time. We got some of our favorites, and everything was great with the exception of the bread and hummus. The bread was really hard. Previously we've been at peak times so they're constantly making fresh bread. The hummus was overly salty this time around."}
{"text":"You literally cannot go wrong here. Everything is incredible. LOVE their falafels and schug sauce!"}
{"text":"Argh wanted to like this. Bowl concept is so hot right now. Anyhow- I got the one meat bowl- got the chicken and essentially put most all of the different offerings in the bowl. Most of the items were unfortunately bland or salty and not seasoned well nor tasty :( and I love middle eastern or Mediterranean foods . Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Delicious middle eastern food provided in a fast, take-out fashion. The shawarma is delicious and the different side options are great. I particularly enjoyed the Brussel Sprouts and Cauliflower."}
{"text":"Very crowded at lunch time and about a 15 minute wait in the queue before getting to the front and working my way down the line. If you've been to any one of those assembly line places like Subway or Blaze or Chipotle, then you're already familiar with the basic format here at Yafo. Start with a base, add veggies, add extras, done.  But with that said, you've probably never had these sort of goodies before. I had the hummus bowl as my base, which is a massive portion (like a full cup's worth) of hummus, then added fresh tomatoes and fresh cucumber and a chickpea salad and some stewed cabbage and stewed onions and then a big scoop of feta cheese, then had it topped with pulled rotisserie chicken. And then a side (which they call a mezze) of the roasted Brussels Sprouts.  It was AMAZING. So many flavors, so many textures, so much deliciousness in every single bite. Just all full of wow.  Totally will be back to Yafo. Wow!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we had high hopes for this place and we wanted to love it, but it started with the customer service I had with the first employee at the beginning of the line. I asked questions and I was given short answers that were not helpful. They had zero interest to help. So because of that I decided on something that I instantly started to regret. With the growing line behind us I decided to just go with it and I thought that it would be better once more stuff was added to it. This was not the case. Although the person that was adding the toppings was polite and helpful the topping selection was not very good and it ended up looking worse and worse, then it came time for the sides I learned that I didn't have the option for a side, but my partner did because he got a wrap. I really wanted to try some of them so we decided to get them anyway and pay the extra money for them. We got my Falafel bowl and his falafel wrap along with 3 sides and water to drink which came to $29.74. We received rudeness from the cashier and we were just frustrated and annoyed by this point. We sat down to eat and noticed many employees sitting in the dining room taking breaks staring at us and other customers which was very uncomfortable for us, not professional, and also not pleasant for us. The issue with this place is that it's not made to order. It is a cafe style restaurant. The food is pre made and pretty much cold when it is put into the cups/plates/bowls, including the falafel balls. There are some that are meant to be cold and those were fine, but cold potato wedges are not okay. Cold roast veggies is not okay. The food was seasoned, but not seasoned enough also everything tasted the same. They offer vegan options and that is great, but it's not easy to customize when questions are looked over and not given clear and assertive answers. It was not a pleasant experience and we didn't enjoy the food. This place is so not worth the price."}
{"text":"New favorite spot in Southpark! General manager, David, was so friendly and even brought out a water bowl for my pup. Food is delicious, very friendly staff. My pup and I are definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten tons of amazing Israeli falafel having lived in Toronto for many years with a vibrant Israeli/Jewish population. I've searched for fantastic falafel in Charlotte for nine years. I finally found it!!! Their falafel and salads are the creation of their Israeli chef and are delicious! The laffah wraps are freshly made and perfectly soft. I had the potato wedges and Brussels sprouts on the side. Both were so good. And the portions were very healthy. Great value for my money! Plus, they have this super delicious watermelon lime juice that the general manager said is made fresh every day. It's even better than I thought it could be, which was already a high bar. To top it off, the staff were all very friendly, offering up samples of the shawarma and sides. They really capped off a great dining experience. Can't wait to return! This is now my go to place for falafel!"}
{"text":"So good, so fresh, so flavorful.  Like no place else.  Get the half and half bowl, the falafel, the beets, the cauliflower.... can't wait to try the brussels sprouts. Found out about this place and then went back twice before the week was out.  In my top three for Charlotte."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mediterranean food I have ever tasted. The wait was long during lunch hour but well worth it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the entire city. Generous portions of fresh flavorful food. What else could you ask for. It can be a little confusing to order your first time, but once you do it once, you'll have it figured out. The interior/exterior seating is also quite nice for a fast casual restaurant."}
{"text":"Food very good, very fresh. Very expensive for fast casual. Would be five stars if not for the price....but that will limit how often we go for what you get given what you pay."}
{"text":"OMG! The food here is insane! My job always has this place cater for our meetings. I had my family try it. We all love it!"}
{"text":"This place is such a nice addition!  I was really excited and it did not disappoint. I've eaten here twice and both times have been an overall great experience. While I'm a little over the amount of \" fast-casual\" places popping up all over Charlotte, I really, really like this one. Fast-causal with good prices for the quality and quantity. $10-13 bucks for a large meal.  You can build your own 'Greek bowl' and fill it with many delicious flavors and everything seems very fresh. The Greek Mac and Cheese was great too!  Go check this place out, I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out at the recommendation of a friend. The process is similar to Chipotle and other fast casual restaurants..you go through the \"assembly\" line and pick the items you want and pay at the end. If your item takes additional prep time then it will be brought out to you.   First off, before your start your order you get to watch someone making pita bread.   I had a bowl with half hummus and half romaine and added my toppings from there. The assemblers put everything in its own spot in your bowl and it's your job to mix all the flavors together. Loved the beats and the tabouleh options. There are carnivore options and plenty of vegetarian options to meat everyone's palette. Additionally they have a few creative options at the drink stand. Note: napkins sre below in the counter.  The staff is super friendly and helpful. I was greeted at the door by the cleanup crew who instructed me how this place works.  My only complaint is the amount of hummus is a bit too much. I only had half. I can't imagine eating the full bowl.  Good place from one of Charlotte's well known restauranteurs. We need more of these locally owned places around town."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. The food is fresh and locally sourced. The menu is diverse and has something for everybody. I really appreciate that the managers and (even the head chef at times) comes around to your table to ask how things are. The chef even asked us if there any improvements we would suggest. With their mouths full and smiles on our faces we managed to mumble something indicating no improvements needed. I highly recommend the Shawarma chicken bowl, and don't be shy with the toppings. Pro tip: get a side of hummus, it is the best hummus in Charlotte. The sprouts and cauliflower are also amazing."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden gem off of Sharon Road in South Park! I am so excited that I found this little Mediterranean food spot. The staff was very fast and friendly. The food was very very tasty! I will definitely be a regular here!"}
