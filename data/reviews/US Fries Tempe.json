{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I've tried a few different options and they have all been delicious. I work on Mill, so I was excited to have a new place on the block. Every time I have gone has been a great experience, the staff has always been very friendly and the food has always been good. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love Poutine! Friendly, fast and delicious.  Come down to Mill Ave , have a beer and stop by before you leave. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Tried the Pork Three Way poutine (regular size). Heavenly, and plenty of good food to fill up a big guy with a good appetite. Ham, pulled pork, and bacon on top of fries, melty cheese curds and gravy. I'll be back and I'll bring my amigos."}
{"text":"Authentic Canadian deliciousness! Every variety of poutine has been amazing. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Soooooooo much food.  Hidden gem imo.  If you are going to try this place bring your stretchy pants.  I'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot, the best poutine this side of Canada. The pork three-way was outragesly good and absolutely addictive. Give it a try it is worth the while and it's really reasonably priced."}
{"text":"One of my go to places now! The beef and crispy onion is my absolute favorite! The large is so big I usually eat half there and half at home!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 5 star not because the food was great but because they were good at service! The food was ok we got philly fries and the gravey wasn't very good in my personal opinion and the \"Wisconsin Cheese Curds\" tasted good but they aren't like the fried curds you get at the fairs in Wisconsin. Price was a little high although there is a lot into it I just couldn't justify going back again. But overall I would give it a 7/10 on the food scale but I won't rate bad on yelp because it affects it so much!"}
{"text":"Can't get over the gravy here. They have a lot of different options here but when it comes right down to it they nail the basics. Good fries, good cheese curds, and good gravy. I had the pulled pork and the shepard's pie and recommend them both. Definitly pick up an eegee, especially if you've never had one before."}
{"text":"Tried the food because it was something I had never had before! It was ok, big portions, worth the price.
NOT wheelchair accessible all the way to the ordering counter!"}
{"text":"I saw that people reported that it was closed but wanted to check for myself and indeed it is closed down"}
{"text":"1 star for hot fries and 1 for a cold slushy and that's about it. I would consider this place drunk people food because of the low quality products.

I was expecting fresh cut fries because of the stores name but they taste like a generic brand of store bought. I ordered a basic cheese fry and I see the girl squirter cheese from a ketchup tube. So I asked her if that was wiz and she said nacho cheese...ummmmm....ok.

Then as I'm enjoying the slush drink I start to notice that my drink also has tiny non dissolving particles in it.

Needless to say I was disgusted and left. I should of just went to Steak and Shake"}
{"text":"Really great fries! Tons of delicious and fun combos. The gravy is trashy good and the fries are crunchy. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious crispy fries if you havent tried the philly cheesesteak pourine definately try  it delicious"}
{"text":"I have never been so offended by staff in a restaurant. The cook informed me that they were \"out of pulled pork\" then when I tried to order a burger they said they were out of burger meat. Then they informed us that they were out of fries. My African American friend then was strait up refused service. I didn't know that this was the 1950s... don't come here.."}
{"text":"What a find U.S. Fries was! The traditional Poutine was fantastic! The gravy was very good and they weren't kidding when they said \"large\"! My husband was able to skip his gym workout and just lift his his bowl of Shepherd's Pie fries, it was that heavy!  Totally loaded and delicious. And we took home leftovers. Breakfast, anyone? ;)  OK, maybe not this time - we held out until lunchtime and it tasted just as good after reheating it. Yumm!  But I'm going to hold onto that breakfast thought for next time..."}
{"text":"The most amazing and creative place I've been in a while. I think the name of the restaurant is what has turned some people off from wanting to try it out.

The idea of eating fries for dinner doesn't sound all that appealing to most, unless you've had poutine as a meal before. All of the variations on their menu are delicious, I've had the traditional, the philly cheesesteak, and the cheeseburger poutine. I've also tried their burgers, which were delicious and huge! I'm a big guy and was not able to finish all of my food because of how filling it all was.

The décor inside is definitely a touch of class. They have a large table that can seat multiple parties without the feeling of being cramped. They have TV's everywhere and those cool coke machines that have a bunch of customizable flavors.

The only knock that I would say I had was the pricing. It was a little pricey, but I didn't complain much because I used a promotion through an app to get a modest discount. The price of the poutine is the only thing that prevented me from giving this place 5 stars.

Great service too! I didn't have to wait more than 15 minutes for a large order for 2."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Managers were very unprofessional. I waited for my food for an unreasonable amount of time. Would not recommend visiting this location."}
{"text":"I had seen the sign & store front when driving downtown on Friday, decided to drop in on Saturday, we didn't know that it was their grand opening - what a phenomenal concept. 
Poutine is excellent, great environment & remarkable prices and options. 
Open one in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"It's 5:30pm on a Saturday, the door was locked and I couldn't get in. I've heard good things about this place, but because it's was closed when it's posted that it's open was a big inconvenience to me. I will definitely re-think taking time out of my day to visit this place again."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here. It was delicious!! Comfort food at its best!! Good portions with plenty of toppings. I loved that I was not left with just plain fries at the end. Not only was the food excellent but the server (Michael,I think) was so enthusiastic about his job, the food and was very friendly, he made you feel very welcome. He mentioned that everything was cooked on site and made fresh. You can certainly tell. Definitely going to be going back for more!!!"}
{"text":"My first poutine, is great!  The staff is very helpful and the food is amazing!  I got the pork three ways with a side of cheese curds.  Perfect!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. The owner met us at the door and told us all about the food, the history and some cool food facts about poutine. He is certainly proud of his business as he should be. We ordered two different poutine fries and the tiramisu dessert. All was amazing. We found this place through a Groupon and will certainly be back!!!"}
{"text":"The cashier with his arms completely tattooed was extremely rude to our entire group. He even cussed at the customers behind us"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable poutine! I got the traditional to share and my husband tried the pork three ways. All very yummy and Angel who was working was very nice and friendly. I'm Canadian and it's nice to have a legit poutine place in AZ!"}
{"text":"First time having Poutine fries - we ordered the Philly Cheese Steak... And it was so good that we finished it in a breath! The people working here are VERY friendly and helpful! Amazing customer service - specifically Fisher and Brandon! 

My dad wanted some lemon for his tea, and Fisher was just talking to us about Eegee's, so he brought over a lemon Eegee's on the house! Incredible! It tastes so fresh too! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see US Fries come up because I've had poutine fries at other restaurants & really enjoyed them. I gave this place 2 chances before deciding what to rate it. This review is more like 2.5 stars - I'm rounding up.

The first time, I ordered the vegetarian poutine was really disappointed. The onions & peppers were too mushy & made for a big sloppy mess with the gravy & soft fries (cheese curds also included).

I didn't find this worth the return trip but gave it the benefit of the doubt & decided to go back about a week later.

The second time, I ordered the chili corn poutine. Although it was much better than the previous one, I wasn't impressed. Th chili was mediocre at best & unfortunately there was too much gravy that had sank to the bottom. Additionally, The price was a little bit over $8!

I might return but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"There are two great reasons to go to US Fries. One, they have excellent poutine, which for those who are unfamiliar is a Canadian dish from Quebec composed of french fries and cheese curds topped with gravy. Yes, it sounds gross at first but it is surprisingly good. Along with the traditional style, US Fries also has other styles of poutine including shepherd's pie and vegetarian. Two, they sell Eegee's! Again, for those not familiar, Eegee's is a type of icy fruit slushies from Tucson. Sure it's a weird combination: Quebec food, Tucson drinks, all served on Mill Avenue in Tempe, but hey, it works. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Five stars for customer service alone, (I believe his name was Orlene? Probably didn't spell that right, sorry) greeted us at the door with a massive smile smacked on his face and humorous youthful enthusiasm. He asked us how our day was and cracked jokes, very patient and understanding young man. He left us in a great mood upon leaving the restaurant.

As for the food the burger was bomb, great bread and perfect pickle/mustard combo, but you know it's a burger. They have one of those giant magic pick anything Coke machines and Cholula which at that point I'm sold. My friend said the poutine gravy was a little overkill but oh well. Overall enjoyed it, music is a bit loud though."}
{"text":"The location is great, they are open late and is perfect for late night food after leaving the bars. We tried the poutine for lunch and it was very tasty and filling. We had the Philly cheesesteak which was good and the Pork 3 ways which was excellent! The fried cheese curds were excellent as well. The staff was very friendly and helpful with our stroller and kids high chairs. We will definitely be back to try the burgers because they looked delicious!"}
{"text":"As a lover of poutine, I enjoy it whenever I get the chance (I'm a southern Californian and not many poutine restaurants in my area). In the afternoon traveling through Phoenix I saw this place on a groupon deal, decided to give it a try, and was not dissapointed !! They have just about their whole menu dedicated to poutine, and the welcoming staff are there to help. The atmosphere is very modern and clean, nicely settled in the town of Tempe. Oh, and did I mention that the portions are HUGE? Great prices, friendly staff, cool atmosphere, and yummy food!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting to try this place since before it opened as I love poutine.  it was a Thursday night and this place wasnt at all busy.  We wanted to try different things so we ordered Pork 3ways, Original, Chicken Fajita and the Beef and Crispy Onion.  The frys were good but there was not much cheese and it had a lot of sauce on the original, the pork 3 ways was tasty as was the chicken fajita but the beef and crispy onions didnt have much beef and the beef was COLD to boot!  When asked why I was told you have to request the beef be hot, well that doesnt make sense to me, I am ordering HOT fries and gravy why would I want cold meat on top!  there was not much beef on top either.  The prices are somewhat high in my opinion for what you get.  I would not go out of my way to come back, but may go back if I was in the area and wanted poutine."}
{"text":"I got the cheeseburger poutine... it was awesome.

I don't care what the other reviews say about how the fries \"should\" be soft, they are way better the way they are here, crispy,  not soggy. While yes, they could have some more options for fries if their name is \"US Fries\", and maybe use hand-cut or what have you, but the fries were really good in my opinion... and I love fries.

The ground beef was tasty, regular portion size was filling for me.

Service was great, place looks really nice. Hope they do well. Can't wait to come back and try some other stuff."}
{"text":"They were very friendly and the service was excellent.  Our poutine was tasty although I think they went a little skinny on the cheese curds.  I know brown gravy is traditional but when the husband makes it at home, he uses homemade turkey gravy...  so I think I'm spoiled.  I didn't like the brown gravy as much."}
{"text":"Super friendly, super good food, and just an awesome place to eat. The inside looks incredible and the food is absolutely delicious. Keep up the good work:)"}
{"text":"I'm probably not a fast food kinda person - still I was excited about US Fries.  I love fries! Security question \"what is your favorite food\" my answer is always french fries.  I suppose I should have asked if the french fries were hand cut fresh on site before going.  Still I'm thinking if your name is US FRIES you should be the master of all things fries. I suspect the fries are made from frozen product bought in bulk. Fresh or frozen the fries are almost tasteless. 

I went with a friend from Canada who is always asking for brown gravy, she misses the poutine of her youth. I couldn't wait to take her to US Fries. She was over the moon with her meal. This is the first time I've witnessed her eating all of her food.  She really liked it. She also likes Denny's, Golden Corral Buffet and processed cheese food. She loves meat and more meat. I'm a vegetarian who has hosted french fry bars, fresh hand cut potatoes fried to a gold brown with soft creamy centers, so yummy! (Points of reference to gauge how your palate might relate.)

Bottom line would I go back? Maybe to accompany a friend, otherwise no way."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how genuine Quebec Poutine tastes like since I've never step foot in Montreal but I can imagine it might taste even more delicious than what is offered at US Fries because theirs is pretty darn good! When I have a craving for some poutine, whether it be lunch or dinner, US Fries has become my go to. I like that they have different topping creations, I've had the Philly Cheesesteak, Pork three ways and the Cheeseburger, and I think my personal fave is the Cheesesteak because it seems less heavy than the cheeseburger. I swear they pack the small order (which is substantial for anyone who has a hearty appetite) with so much ground beef and cheese and curds that it's too much! The cheesesteak on the other hand has a right balance of meat, peppers and curds. Another awesome thing about US Fries is that they sell Eegees! Yay they sell it but I dislike it's one size which is a large cup. They have three flavors and flavor of the month in addition. 

Overall, it's a good place to grab some poutine, enjoy scrumptious fries, and have a refreshing eegee, it's a great addition to the Mill Avenue food scene!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat. The poutine fries were delicious. TUCKER was awesome came out from behind the counter explained everything about poutine and had awesome recommendations. Will definitely come back. Thks again Tucker"}
{"text":"I can see they are trying to take some care in preparation of the food. For example I had the Philly cheesesteak and the meat was not dry or overcooked it wasn't rare but it was not all dried out. There were four of us and we each got something different and the common thing amongst all of them is there was way too much too much salt. Enough for a salt mine. None of us could eat very much of any of it."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time with a Canadian buddy.  I'd only had poutine once before in Verrado and it was amazing!!!!  I was really looking forward to having it again.  I ordered a combo, which was difficult to figure out how the combos worked, with a burger and side of traditional poutine.  My buddy also ordered a burger with a side of fries.  Our meal came up to almost $30!  Way too much for what you get.

Quality of food was ok.  Fries are nothing to brag about which is sad since fries is in the name of the restaurant.  Gravy was good and cheese curds didn't have much flavor.  The burger was good, but very small.  Meat was tasty and loved the bread.  I may try this place again and order something different, but I have a hard time justifying the cost.

Customer service was great!!!  Place looks great, too!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for lunch after seeing a post on their Facebook that they were finally open. 

When your namesake and food is based on french fries, logic dictates you should use quality, hand cut fries. The fries seemed to be out of a bag, a little over cooked, and just mediocre at best. Poutine fries should be a thicker cut, and soft.

The cheese had an odd taste to it. It certainly didn't taste like fresh curds, nor did it squeak. I'm not sure where these come from, but the cheese curds available at the dairy on Broadway and Hardy are more suitable for poutine. 

The Gravy was OK. Consistency was wrong, as it was a little too thick, almost pudding like. There wasn't enough, as once I got to the middle, the fries were naked. In Montreal they do a layer of fries, curds and gravy, followed by another layer on top. Gravy was quite salty as well, I can still taste the salt.

I was assured on Facebook that as a Montrealer I wouldn't be disappointed. Unfortunately I was. 

It'll be good food for the bar crowd Friday and Saturday nights. 

I'll try it again once they get into the swing of things, but I don't think I'll be trying any of the gentrified options."}
{"text":"They got my order wrong when I brought it up the guy he took it to the back pulled the old patty off and put it on a new bun. There was still mustard on the patty I didn't want mustard. Jerk move. I have never had a restaurant pull that. I will never go back."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after I heard they were opening up on Mill Avenue. They had a free Poutine day so we decided to try it out.

The owner is extremely friendly and is very personable. He loves to hear suggestions as well as compliments of course. I ordered the Cheeseburger poutine and my fiance chose the regular poutine.

I've tried poutine before but have not had it meet my expectations until now. The cheeseburger poutine was an interesting blend of flavors and It was delicious. Though the regular poutine was perfect. The cheese had the squeaky aspect and the gravy was the perfect consistency. Overall it all blended perfectly and not a single bite was left. It was filling and definitely worth it. The prices aren't so bad and the hours are great if you go drinking during the weekend on Mill. So check this place out. Parking is a little hard so I would try to park near Fuzzys if possible which is metered parking by the way.

So if you want a piece of Canada, check out U.S. Fries."}
{"text":"I love this place! Didn't go in there for quite awhile thinking that it was just fries and gravy. My wife wanted to try it so we finally did. I was surprised at how broad their menu is. So far I've had Shephards Pie and Beef Stroganoff. All their dishes can be on top of fries, or rice and they were great. Also, their eegees (an ice or slushy type drink) are made with real fruit and are great. What a great find!"}
{"text":"Everybody must eat here! I'm originally from Canada, and if you know what a poutine is then you know that us  \"CANADIANS\" have very high standards when it comes to poutine. Also on top of it I have a culinary background so my standards are so much higher. But US Fries blew me away from day one. Their food is delicious, authentic also is the closest thing to back home. But as the last reviewer said \" They have had some serious mishaps when it comes to their employees \" but let me tell you the huge turn around this restaurant has done in the last 3 months due to the manager. She has turned this restaurant upside down 100% and is making the experience better and better everytime. So with that said I want to say thank you to US FRIES for bringing us such amazing poutine to Arizona. But a real special thanks to the Manager for actually caring and pouring your heart, blood, and tears into the restaurant because it really shows."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean, I'll give them that much. But the food was overpriced, super lack luster and the poutine we received was literally drenched with gravy (way too much) and cold. 
We left feeling extremely dissatisfied and won't be returning again."}
{"text":"Very convenient location for those who binge drink on mill Ave. to come and pig out! Maybe I'm just not a fan of the gravy, but I definitely loved the idea. I got the philly and the chili cheese! Good eats!"}
{"text":"I seriously cannot stop coming here. I've already lost track of how many times I've visited in the few short of weeks that they've been open. The food is so good! The classic poutine is fantastic and all the tasty variations are wonderful. I seriously dream of their food. You need to do yourself the favor and stop by.

P.S. If the owner sees this, your employees should have a tip jar. They work very hard and i greatly appreciate the service. In my last few visits, I've tried to slip them a little bit here and there."}
{"text":"If you've never had poutine, you are missing out. This is a must try. I had the beef and crispy onion, with brown gravy and horseradish sauce. My breath is going to be awful for the next few hours, but it was worth it. Make sure you stop in the next time you are on Mill."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the door we had an enjoyable experience. The staff are more than welcoming! They all are extremely friendly and helpful! Being as it is our first time here we ordered, after given recommendations, the Philly Cheesesteak and Carne Asada fries...Amazing! Carne Asada was slightly more of our favorite. Fresh and so flavorful. Also ordered one of their eegees...BOMB! I can't wait to try out everything else on their menu!!"}
{"text":"2 words. So. Bomb.

I've never had Poutine before. But I've definitely had each of the ingredients separately.

I got a regular serving of traditional Poutine.

It was extremely good. 

My co-worker had the Cheesburger Poutine and we've already discussed going back next week.

Worth it!"}
{"text":"They have EGGEES!!!!  I've never had poutine before but I have had eggees and that was enough to pull me in.  I was staying nearby at the Tempe Mission Palms and needed to nurse my hangover with junk food.  This place hit the spot.  The fries topped with gravy and cheese was gooey goodness.  It should also be mentioned that they have a soda dispenser that fulfills your every soda desire at the touch of the screen.  THAT combined with eggees and cheesy fries makes this the obvious choice for a hangover."}
{"text":"I heard rave things about. We went in for dinner and I was pleased with their selection. It didn't taste bad, but it didn't wow me.

Breaking it down, it was french fries with sauce on it. And some meat and cheese too... I'm not sure if that was worth the $10. And everything was put in TO GO boxes so the presentation was not that great.

It's good to try. But it's expensive for fast food, and it's really not a lot of food."}
{"text":"Poutine. Yup. Proof that we'll eat just about anything if you put it on top of french fries. This place is a bit dive-y but the main dish was awesome. This is poutine that you have to eat with a fork and knife. I had the cheeseburger poutine minus onions and plus bacon (why there isn't a bacon cheeseburger poutine I'm not sure). It was quite a bit on the salty side but good overall. I thought the price was a bit steep but the portion size was generous. We also had the fried cheese curds which were delicious, especially dipped in the accompanying dressing/sauce.
Half a strike for the restroom being outside of the restaurant and down the pathway although this isn't exactly the fault of the restaurant it would have been nice to know."}
{"text":"So amazing. I thought about ordering [philly cheesesteak] without gravy but that would've been a major mistake. I added sautéed mushrooms and it was delicious. I got the large, took half home and ate it all the next day and it was STILL good. their cheese curds are to die for also. and the service was wonderful. LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Being from Canada, it's hard to find a good poutine south of the boarder. But they do a pretty good job. Kinda pricy and they try to fancy it up a lot, but tasty and fresh. They do make a homemade burger and it is amazing!"}
{"text":"These fries are SO GOOD. Ive tried many of their poutine styles but the pork 3 ways is easily my favorite. The fries start out crispy so they dont get soggy immediately, and they load it up with meat and gravy so that each fry has toppings on it (unlike many places where after the first layer of fries is eaten, the remaining fries have nothing on them)

Super filling, the staff is incredibly nice, and really hits the spot when youre craving loaded fries."}
{"text":"A few friends and I got 3 different orders so I tasted them all.  I wasn't impressed by any of it. Personal preference I guess. Staff was nice though."}
{"text":"Went today for a late lunch, I ordered the cheeseburger poutine and my bf ordered pork 3 ways poutine. The staff was friendly and the food came out fast. It looked really yummy but I just didn't like mine:( Either the meat or the cheese had a weird smell to it. Guessing the beef since my bf's food smelled fine. I don't think it was spoiled or anything, just cooked/seasoned different than I cook mine. My food was really salty too. I ate about 7 bites and called it quits. Gave the rest to a sweet homeless man outside who started devouring it immediately. My bf finished his food and said it was pretty good, but his stomach hurt him for a good while afterwards cause it's definitely not easy to digest with all the salt and fat. My review is solely based on the cheeseburger poutine (I liked the fries and pickles!), I'm open to try a different menu item another time. Poutine isn't for me, but I'm glad I tried it!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place opening as I work in downtown Tempe, and figured it would have Mill Ave prices, but I was astounded to pay $11 for a small order of cheese fries covered in unseasoned ground beef and a soda. Especially when the fries are not fresh cut (definitely frozen spuds) and  there were maybe 5 or 6 cheese curds that didn't seem to be that great themselves. The worst part was I wasn't even full when I was done and also starving within 2 hours. 

The food is good but the portion and quality do not match the cost."}
{"text":"I came with a small group and ordered the frice dish. I was disappointed at first because it was mostly rice and very light in the sauce and chicken, while my friends got their rice and fries smothered. I just asked for a little extra gravy. The person I believe to be the manger not only gave me extra gravy, she brought me a whole new order, because she didn't like the presentation.  It's the little things like that, that make me appreciate a place.  Besides the great service, the food was good, and the place is clean. I recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"I went for the poutine (fried, gravy and cheese curds)  but was disappointed.  Prices were also on the high side in my opinion."}
{"text":"FINALLY... REAL POUTINE IN AZ!!!!!! I tried poutine in Canada and fell in love with it but haven't had authentic, delicious poutine since coming back to Az. Food is great, service was fast and friendly and the place is REALLY, REALLY cool inside. Big fan... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was in the area attending a fundraising event.  But I had to hit this place up since it was around the corner: Poutine fries with Beef, crispy onions, jalepenos & horsey sauce with a Lemon Eegee's...yum!!!  The food was so good and the service was great.  The gentleman was friendly and accommodating. This was the first time I've tried Poutine, since learning about it."}
{"text":"Need one of these in STL. Wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Pulled pork and bacon on fries.  Enough said.  This place is no frills and simple.  The food is good and filing.  Service was excellent.  The guys catered to special orders and even threw in some cold slaw.  This was a great place to take the family."}
{"text":"An enjoyable experience. I've never tried poutine and I got excited when I heard about this place offering a vegetarian version. Everyone was super friendly here and we (friend and I) both thought the dish was pretty tasty. We added hot sauce to it because we felt it needed an extra kick. Since I've never had poutine before, I have no point of comparison but I appreciated the veg version with the mushroom gravy, mushrooms, bell peppers, and onions. The fries were clearly hot and fresh. The regular (as opposed to the large) was a good size and we were both able to finish it. It wouldn't be a good dish to take as leftovers since it's meant to be eaten hot."}
{"text":"I went there on the opening day! The environment was very welcoming and I also like the music they played. 
It was the first time i tried poutine. I tried the chili corn poutine which was really tasty!!! Will definitely go back soon to try their eegee's, which they didn't have at the time."}
{"text":"This was a first ever 'poutine' experience and I've gotta admit that the Canadians knew what the heck they were doing!

I had the beef and crispy onion and my wife had the Philly cheesesteak. The Philly cheesesteak was probably the better of the two, but honestly there wasn't a great difference in taste, and that's likely attributed to the gravy having such a strong distinguished flavor. The gravy was delicious, but it kind of overpowered the taste of everything else. 

I wish they had a little more variety, because most of the options seem like the same with very slight variations. It also is slightly overpriced in my opinion for what you actually get. There isn't much meat which is very unfortunate."}
{"text":"This wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be. My wife and I got the pork three way with traditional poutine to split. The service was fairly quick to get the food to us but more or less gave off the air of \"I really don't want to be here\", which needless to say wasn't very pleasant. The food was a bit of a let down though. The pork three way is essentially all traditional poutine but with 2 small slices of deli ham, super oily bacon bits, and shredded bbq pork on top. So it all essentially tasted the same. I walked away feeling fully but not very satisfied. Food was way too oily for my taste and there was a complete lack of flavors in the pork three way. I guess I should have seen it coming but oh well. Not sure if I'd come here again, I don't really see the draw anymore."}
{"text":"Coming from Canada, and now living in the U.S. , there are some things that I miss; poutine is one of them. U.S. Fries Poutine is like a little taste from home. It's one of the best poutines I have had in a long time! The restaurant itself is very fun, modern and clean. I highly recommend it to all."}
{"text":"I lived in Canada for over 20 years, hearing that I was finally going to get some poutine again after over 5 years I was excited to try this place.  They did not disappoint!!

I got the traditional for my first try of this place.  I had to make sure they had the right stuff before I ventured onto their other creations.  The fries were cooked to perfection for poutine.  A little extra crispy so they don't just soak up all the gravy and become soggy.  The brown gravy was full of flavor and the cheese curds were simply great.

The only criticism I have, I consider this minor, is that I would have preferred the poutine served on a plate so the fries at the bottom didn't have so much gravy on them.  Spread it out a little for all the fries to share.

I can't wait to go back and try some other combinations.

Flavor suggestion: add one with Montreal smoked meat!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place but it only gets a mediocre rating. Though the burger was tasty and fresh, for the price on Mill Avenue with tons of college kids,  the price was pretty steep. The fries were nothing special which should of been amazing since they have the name fries in their name. It would be nice to have some hand cut fries rather than the frozen kind. The restaurant itself was decorated nicely, but I can't rave about the place due to the price. Note: If you order bacon, it's not full bacon strips but crumbled which was different but odd as it's hard to keep on your burger."}
{"text":"A nice treat, but not something I'd want to have regularly. We got the original poutine (fries, cheese curds, gravy) and they were kind enough to sub in the vegetarian gravy (regular is beef-based, just FYI). Although the gravy/cheese curd combo was fine, I've had better, and it wasn't an earth-shattering, flavor-explosion like I was expecting based on the reviews. 

I think if they did the layering technique (fries-sauce-fries-sauce), I would've liked it better. Half of our fries were just plain; they tasted fine, but if I'm going to pay $9 for potatoes, they better be smothered potatoes. 

It's worth checking out but I wasn't overly impressed."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Fries are frozen, not cut in store. 5 Guys down the street cuts their potatoes and is a BURGER place. Here we have a fries place that doesn't!  Also, it's over $8 with tax for a small portion. No thanks."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were a little high and my brow a little furrowed after the ordeal of finding a parking spot on Mill, but I was not impressed. Starting with the good, they are very liberal with the gravy and toppings. And it was tasty. Now for the not so good. It was tasty until it was salty and the fries were soggy, which is basically after the first, maybe second, layer of fries. Let me explain, the gravy on its own was pretty salty and hits you a few bites in. So add greasy bacon bits, or cheese curds, or a couple slices of ham to that, and well, I really needed yet another cup of water. The main dishes themselves were priced at $7.99 for a small and $11.49 for a large. I don't know if that's considered reasonably priced for poutine, but I thought it was a little pricey. Not to be melodramatic but, adding insult to injury, if you want to make that a meal, it's $3.49 on top of that. That's not terrible, you say, but what's in this $3.49? Well, you get your choice of either a side of traditional poutine, regular fries, or a cole slaw. Does it come with a drink? For a discounted price of $1 on top of that $3.49, then yes, it'll come with a drink. I'm thinking maybe we should have walked out when we saw nobody was in the store while other restaurants had a lively crowd going? 2.5 stars, I'm rounding down."}
{"text":"In Tempe we stopped at US Fries for a Poutine lunch. Kids shared a large traditional Poutine that was very similar to put NYF Poutine back in Canada 3.5/5. My fiancée and I had the vegetarian Poutine which had a nice flavour but nothing too memorable 3.5/5. Free refills on pop and free water. Good value at $23 to feed the four of us."}
{"text":"You don't have to be Canadian to enjoy these poutines! It was my first time here and I had the philly cheese steak poutine  -- the fries were deliciously crispy outside yet soft in the middle, the mixture of the cheese, sauce, meat and onions all blended deliciously! The people working here are super nice as well!"}
{"text":"U.S Fries definitely had my eye since it used to be fat burger! Always wanted to try it and finally did! Heart of mill avenue right next to the classic Starbucks on mill ave. Walk up the ramps to order and view the wide menu, lots of choices I might say. I couldn't decide and Yelp wasn't that helpful this time in my gut I was deciding on the Philly cheesesteak fries which looked and sounded really good or be basic and get the original! So I didn't do either of those choices I asked the cashier which one she recommended and also pointed out the philly cheese or carne asada but she said her favorite was the cheeseburger Poutine fries which I actually chose as the winner of this match, this time. It was okay I wasn't wowed I loved the gravy and maybe more seasoned beef but it was okay definitely gotta get the Philly cheesesteak I love things with full
Of flavor if you wanna be on the safe side and with meat the cheeseburger is with you! But I'm definitely gonna come back, restaurant wasn't as busy and it looked like a chill place bring all your friends to try the different fries and the fries also come in two sizes regular & large. Common sense in ordering of course and definitely get an Eegee it was delicious ! Okay Phoenix, stay cool and stay hungry!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on halloween, and they were packed. In fact they serve great drunk food. Don't walk in expecting burgers because you won't find it. It's a fries joint, they have fries served with whatever you want right on top. The standard is just fries smothered in cheese curds and brown gravy. Next time i go back I'll get some meat on my fries in addition to the cheese curds."}
{"text":"Fries are crispy and good.  I had the BBQ sandwich and no joke it made for 2 meals.
when I was there they didn't yet have Egees, so we'll see now that I hear they have that up and running.  For valley folks that's the southern Arizona equivalent to Bahama Bucks.

I love that they really work to get tour business, and everyone was very nice, the service was good, food was excellent as well.

I have a slight french fry addiction so I'm slightly biased on this though.  NO so much on the poutine, but I hear they do it right by many of my friends from Quebec."}
{"text":"Because it's not enough that we destroy the planet in every sport that matters, I am so, so happy to see our dominance in the culinary world. We destroy cuisine across the globe so we may make it our own, and that trend is continuing with its next conquest. Poutine, something I'm delighted to try without visiting Quebec, has made its way to Mill Ave. It's the fast food you HAVE to try. Traditionally, it's just fries, gravy, and cheese curds, but US Fries gives you the option of dumping a variety of meats or veggies on something that already has like a million calories. 

God Bless America. 

I couldn't decide which variety to get, so I played it safe and went with the bacon variety. Because the base ingredients are pre-made, it was ready in just a couple minues. Loaded with scallions, I was pretty excited to dig into this one. The first few bites were great! But around the halfway point, I slowed down abruptly. This may have been the saltiest meal I've ever had. The gravy on its own would be OK, as would the bacon, but combined it was just too intense for me. Next time, I'll try a different, sweeter variety. Or a burger. Or both! I would classify the size of these poutine boxes as adequate for a small lunch. If you're really hungry, the $8-10 you'll drop here can probably score you something a bit more substantive in this district.

I am sure there are better items here, so I'll be back for sure. Just don't come in expecting your mind to be blown, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything more fitting for drunchies, college students or those who prioritize fries before guys. As a carb addict, I was drawn to US Fries like a moth to a light after an evening stroll out by Tempe Beach Park.

Decided to split a Large box of the Philly Cheesesteak Fries because it was pretty much poutine except with Philly Cheesesteak, come on! The price for a box of fries is a steep, however very filling for two people to share. The fries come with a good amount of gravy, meat and cheesecurds. The gravy was good, but wouldn't be surprised if it was prepared in a can or bag. The portion of meat was actually very generous. It's not the most appealing thing to eat, however, it was delicious and was sent into my carb induced bliss.

Good amount of seating indoors, located on Mill Ave and open late nights."}
{"text":"food isn't bad. Service is pretty good and they serve beer. All in all a place I would recommend trying at least once"}
{"text":"Delicious and different. Poutine is the greatest idea ever and the restaurant is beautiful. Super cool place and great food and service."}
{"text":"Very nice people i have nothing against the service.  I ordered the Carne Asada Fries based on the name being US Fries.  I was asked during my order if I would like to add Guacamole, Sour Cream, and Cheese.  I agreed as I like those things with my Carne Asada Fries.  this almost doubled my price order from $11 to $18.  I am a bit of a foody and i agreed as I was going to share them with a friend.  What came next looked very good.  There was Carne Asada, Guac, Sour Cream, and Cheese on top of french fries.  The surprise came in the first bite when I tasted gravy and cheese curds mixed together with the guac, sour cream, pico, and carne asada.  My friend and I really wanted to give it a shot, but the brown, green, white blend that started to form was inedible.  This place should probably be called US Poutine as is it seems this is put on EVERY entree.  A little warning would have been helpful, and $18 for one entree seemed highly excessive."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

I've only tried the basic, traditional poutine here and I need to go back to try some of the speciality poutine, but I think the 3-star review is warranted just based on the straight poutine alone.

My basis for comparison is from my time in Montreal and the Northeast.  Is it fair to compare poutine here to the poutine of its country of origin?  Sure, why not?  Especially considering that I've had poutine in the States (Maine in particular) that far exceeds this place.

So to start, this place is not bad at all.  The poutine was really just, routine.  (Purposeful rhyme.)  On the plus side, the fries were nice, hot, and crispy.  On the minus, the gravy was a little too salty and the cheese curds didn't squeak like the best do.  But on the whole, it's decent, more than just edible, and if I were wasted, I probably wouldn't mind the saltiness, which might bump it to four stars.  But I wasn't wasted, thus, the 3-star review."}
{"text":"First visit the manager was very nice and greeting everyone. The fries were nice and crunchy all the way to the end! First experience with poutine and I would totally eat it again! Got the small philly and a 1/2 pound cheeseburger and split with my husband. It was great.

Only downfall is the awkward seating."}
{"text":"Gray variety of poutine and toppings like philly cheese steak and pulled pork.  Vegetarian options.  Good quality gravy and cheese.  Do it!"}
{"text":"I love US Fries! I biked here today for lunch and saw who I assumed to be the manager sitting outside. He not only addressed me by name, but he also offered to park my bike next to him so no one would steal it while I ate inside. It was really nice feeling welcomed even before stepping into the restaurant. In addition, their fries are REALLY good. They're super crispy and fresh even when drowned in gravy. I'll definitely be going to this place from now on for poutine instead of French Fry Heaven."}
{"text":"Walked in and had to look at staff to get them to greet me. I'm the only person in here and I'm trying to use my $20 Groupon, I have to explain I can only use it one time and I want the max amount, but instead I get a $5 of food. The cashier tried to insist I can only get 1 order and I read the fine print back and forth myself. Then they confess to not listening to me. Well, that explains it. Overpriced food too, I've tried this establishment so many times and it's always something. One guy was nice awhile back but I don't see him anymore."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding! The lady that helped us was absolutely wonderful, patient and so helpful. The inside is pretty cool too, I like the giant map on the side wall. Hooray they have Eegee's--this will be awesome during the summer. The poutine was good but not my favorite. The portions they offer are huge, so be prepared for leftovers (although leftover poutine might be a little soggy). All in all my first visit was a positive one! I'll have to come back and try a bold flavor next time!"}
{"text":"Went to Us Fries today as it is a newer place on Mill ave.  I gave it 2 stars, place is clean and people were nice just not informative of what the meal deal cost was.  Thats the good.  The ok is the poitine, i bought the pork 3 ways and it was Ok not bad but not great.  The really bad is the cost, the poutine was $7.99 and to make it a meal is $5.00 more which is really expensive to me for a drink and coleslaw (which i am sorry to say was awful).  The coleslaw was drowning in mayonaise and just about inedible to me.  So with all thus said, i gave the new place a try but based on cost and what you get for that cost i will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile. Finally got around to doing it yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. I've never had real Canadian poutine by comparison, but this place was excellent. I tried the BBQ sandwich, burger, traditional poutine, cheese curds and the beef and crispy onion poutine. Everything was prepared perfectly and the gentlemen working there were helpful and friendly. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Saw this new spot on mill so I thought Id give it a try before the movie. First thing right off the bat I notice the amazing interior. The split level room gives it a unique look. They also have a few Tvs as well. Second thing is the staff, the customer service was surprisingly great. Everyone including the folks were very nice. The one thing I have to say is maybe instead of screaming out our name over the music is giving us numbers and having someone bring us the food. That would be my only complaint. Overall the food was great. Got the large and shared it with my boyfriend. The large filled us both up so its for sure meant for at least two people."}
{"text":"My wife is from Montreal and poutine is a staple there, so when we found out about US Fries we had to try it.

We live in way East Mesa, so it was about a 20 minute drive to get there.  Octoberfest was going on, so traffic was a bit heavy once we got off the freeway, but we found parking on the street about a five minute walk from the restaurant and we felt happy.

When we arrived, there were only 3 other people inside and thought the service might be fast.  But about a minute after us about 10 more people arrived.  Not too bad for a typical fast food joint, but there was only one person working.  Just one person working at 4:37 pm on busy Sunday.  

I think her name was Vivian (very nice girl and very busy) took all of the orders first then started cooking.  She came and apoligized that it was going to take awhile.  It did.  She finally got some help after about 15 minutes, and the two of them hammered out all of the meals, which took maybe 20-25 minutes to get ours.

The food was decent, but I doubt I will make any special trips to get there again.  We each had a 1/3 rd pound burger and traditional poutine combo, each had a soda and we shared an order of cheese curds.  The price was over $30.00 which makes for a pretty expensive meal.  The burgers alone, which are pretty basic, but tasty were $6.99 each.

The poutine was decent but we make better at home, and at much less cost.

If you have never tried poutine before, go ahead and go and check them out, but remember, there is better values else where."}
{"text":"US Fries is a cool spot to hangout at Mill Ave on crazy nights, they have awesome food that will fill you up real quick. Cant seem to get myself to eat there as much as I want to because the food is so rich that you get tired of it quickly. Either way the food is a great, the place is great, and the owner Tom is great."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Owner and staff are very friendly and care about the food and about your opinion."}
{"text":"Mmmm poutine. Poutine is a ridiculous food to eat. It pretty much has no redeeming health qualities.... but it tastes good! This place specializes in topping the already unhealthy poutine with even more toppings. For example, I ordered the meat trio poutine minus the ham... so... a meat duo? I guess. It was poutine topped with pulled pork and bacon. The bacon and the poutine jived well together. The pulled pork was just alright. It was a little on the sweet side. Anyway, the portion was fairly large, but I felt like the prices were quite high for what is essentially fast food. I would return if I were around there, but I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"I'm coming back tomorrow. This place is awesome. Poutine is amazing - tried the sweet BBQ. My kids (who are really picky) loved the rice bowls. The fried cheese curds are a good app. Prices are super reasonable, and the staff is friendly, especially Frenchy P. We were just walking by and decided to give it a try - we have found a new favorite!"}
{"text":"I decided to try out US Fries today. Poutines? What? 
It is a Canadian Dish of fries, gravy, and cheese curds. 

I ordered the large pot roast poutine for about ~$11. 

Relativity expensive, but did leave me satisfied and full. The food is great, new, and definitely something coming back to. Staff is top notch. My only remark is that the amount of gravy can be excessive.

Regardless, I got a taste of Canada, and it was pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Poutine sounds fancy if you don't know what it is, but it's really just Canadian fast food that follows a basic formula: fries, cheese curds, and gravy. US Fries takes it to the next level by offering a variety of different toppings like chili, pulled pork, steak, etc etc. Basically, it's a heart attack in a bowl, but what fast food isn't, eh? There is the vegetarian option which may be slightly less unhealthy for you, which is what I got. My boyfriend got the beef and crispy onions. The fries didn't seem freshly cut and both bowls were salty, but they were still relatively tasty. 

US Fries puts an Americanized twist on this Canadian fast food and they do a decent job. I just think they're a little heavy-handed with the seasoning"}
{"text":"I will definitely be back. The fries were cooked perfectly and stayed crispy. The poutine was so good! I got the Bacon Poutine Fries and I would get that again in a heartbeat but next time I'll probably try something different because they all look so good! I did get 2 Eegee's thinking it would be part of the 2 for 1 Tuesday deal but they both rang up so oh well. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, service, and food was amazing. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. The managers went out of their way to make our time the best it could be and I couldn't be more happier with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Fried cheese curds are delicious and rare burgers are Wisconsin style. Stop in Tempe for some authentic Wisconsin food"}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork this time. Out of this world!  Had their coffee too. Amazing!!!!

Such a nice new and different change from the typical norm. 

Staff was super nice too."}
{"text":"Small place on Mill Avenue. The restaurant has long tables for people to share and eat at with a few tables. 

The menu is small with mainly Poutine.

We tried the Chili Corn Poutine and Pot Roast Poutine, the biggest disappointment was - No Eegees!!

The poutine was a different meal but not bad. Inexpensive and pretty tasty with a good selection to choose from."}
{"text":"My friends and I went on Thursday for the first time. Each of us ordered something different and we enjoyed all of it! There is a wide variety of choices beyond just fries too. We will be returning!"}
