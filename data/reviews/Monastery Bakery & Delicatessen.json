{"text":"Easily the best bakery in Oakville. The aroma alone is worth a visit and I guarantee that it's not possible to enter and leave without making a purchase.  They have an amazing array of fresh baked goods and various kinds of ready made meals. Their potato wedges are particularly good."}
{"text":"I LOVE their bakery. You can't really go wrong with anything from the back of the store. Donuts. Breads. Pies. Breadsticks. Muffins. They make them all in house and they are amazing."}
{"text":"I love most items at Monastery Bakery and regularly buy many types of breads (my kids love the \"knot buns\" and cheese sticks, love when they have fresh easter breads and cinnamon loaf), as well as deli items, cheese, pasta and canned goods, coffee, jams, hot table items, some frozen items -- and quite regularly give into the baked treats in the front display.   While I rarely take advantage of the free coffee, I do like the idea of it being there.  They always have lots of samples, for those who enjoy sampling while they shop.  I don't usually partake and sometimes find the sample people a bit annoying and loud.  I also *really* appreciate that they are open on many holidays when most food stores are closed. The staff are generally good -pleasant, efficient, consistent and cleanly uniformed - and lots of them!  Even a long wait at the deli counter isn't too bad because there are sometimes a 1/2 dozen staff there, and I see the same faces week after week. Their prices are often better than large supermarket chains (e.g., they sell the same fresh mozzarella for $4.99 while Fortino's sells it for $6.99).  I have been disappointed with pre-packaged *fresh* meat  and produce items, to the extent that I have thrown out pre-packaged chicken breasts without cooking them because they smelled so foul and sometimes find that pre-packaged produce (e.g., bell peppers) have mold if I don't use them right away.  I now carefully check dates on pre-packaged meats and/or buy from the counter, and take any produce items from the package before storing in my fridge at home.  While I like their Italian-style baked goods, I'm not so crazy about others sorts of cakes/cupcakes. I wouldn't order a birthday cake for my kids there.  We used to really enjoy their dark chocolate-dipped white macaroons, but I haven't seen these in a while.  Parking is sometimes an issue when they are busy, but I always find a spot in the lot.  Despite some rare bad experiences, I still have to give them a 5/5 because I continue to shop there at least weekly - sometimes multiple times weekly and instead of a big supermarket shop when I can."}
{"text":"I have been going here for many years and it is the best bakery ever. Everything here is amazing. Their breads, bagels, croissants, sausage rolls, pasta, and desserts are so good."}
{"text":"The best bakery, I've been going here since high school for lunch when they only had one unit in the plaza . 25 years later they own most of the plaza and the baked goods, prepared goods & the customer service is still just as amazing!"}
{"text":"Always consistent with their cakes and an excellent selection of fresh and delicious baked goods, hot foods etc. you can order a cake the night before and it will be made fresh. They also don't give you hassle if you make modifications, like add extra fruit or something like that."}
{"text":"You cant find a better bakery in Oakville!  They recently expanded and I wouldnt be surprised that in time they take over the entire plaza.  Wide selection of freshly baked breads, deli meats, fresh meat, sandwiches, free coffee, hot counter and much more.  Try the Jalapeño buns! Arriba."}
{"text":"FABULOUS!!!! Thanks for bringing a bit of Europe to the burbs of Oakville. Have been going there for the last 17 years and will continue for decades to come! Fantastic quality and excellent service. I am there at least 3 times a week and have ordered catering from Monastary several times for functions. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"A regular stop on my shopping route. Usually for the baked goods - particularly for the raisin bread. I have also sampled the various dinner rolls and buns, several other types of bread and a couple of cakes.  The only downside for me is the occassional congestion in the parking lot and the store. However, if you are careful about when you go, you can usually get in and out relatively easily."}
{"text":"Best pastries and bread! Amazing food and LOVE their coffee counter. I keep going in for  croissants and Americanos in the morning. Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I was reminded of my love for Monastery this weekend when my sister (shout outs to Nicole M) came to the house with a bag of cheese sticks, croissants and a coffee cake from Monastery. My family has been going here for years, heading out very early on Saturday mornings for fresh Italian bread, kaisers, crusty Italian buns and  and spicy capicollo.   The store is huge and includes a bakery, dessert counter, cheese counter, deli counter, hot food area and a dry grocery area with a lot of Italian sauces, olives, roasted red peppers, and pasta. The business is family-owned and they bake everything there fresh daily.   For the best selection of bread or desserts, you must go early! It gets very busy on weekends and all of the Oakville moms will fight you for the good bread.   The hot food counter is a bit of a zoo around lunch time, especially with highschool students down the street, but they're used to crowds so the line moves very fast. The hot counter serves veal on a bun, pasta, pizza and potato wedges and chicken. It's all well priced with most items being around $5. The bakery also offers catering and you can pre-order trays of pasta, lasagna, deli meats, cheeses, desserts and cakes."}
{"text":"Such a fantastic place!! My favourite part of this bakery is their dessert display. You can pre-order custom dessert trays. They are awesome! This place has everything. It is not just a bakery."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pattiserie in Oakville, also meats, fruits and bakery are excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Peach apple crumble pie .... Delicious.  Was at a party on the weekend and someone brought some bread and a peach apple crumble pie from here and it was amazing.  The pie wasn't overly sweet which is exactly how I like it.  would like to visit here soon."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after hearing lots about it. There is a great selection of fresh bread that you can smell from the moment you walk in.  It is a very large bakery and takes up almost an entire strip plaza.  When I went there, the traffic was crazy.  Lots of traffic means good quality, right?  There is a hot table to purchase ready made pastas, sandwiches, chicken and ribs. There is also a full delicatessen and pasty are, as well as fresh meat and some produce.  More than just a bakery, indeed.  I got a rice ball from the hot table that was just average. I also had a cannoli from the pastry table, which was also just average (pastries are sold by weight, so could end up being pricey). I was expecting to be blown away by the tastes, but...not so much. The bread, however, was wonderfully fresh.  I am giving 3 stars because the bread really is tasty. Nice bakery, would probably come back for the bread."}
{"text":"Best carrot cake I've ever eaten. Coffee is really good and some other delicatessen. Bread is a bit stiff for my taste."}
{"text":"Still a great bakery and grocery store, but not a great place to be on the weekends. We were there earlier as someone was craving their pie today. We were also hungry for lunch and although we found a couple of seats by their cafe bar, we were really hoping they had a sit-down area to enjoy their hot foods. Cafe bar only serves coffee.. no water or juice so altho the lasagna was amazing (don't get the chicken parmigiana... The chicken had been sitting in the pan for far too long and it was overcooked ), we couldn't satisfy our meal with something to drink besides the espresso.   Over in the pastry section, a customer was harassing one of the sweet girls behind the counter. Another reason not to go on the weekends... Customers get antsy, unruly, impatient, and rude. I really felt for her and when I had the chance, I had to go over to ask if she was ok.  We got lucky with parking and glad they had all the tills open, but just too crazy today to enjoy the experience. Avoid the weekends or risk your sanity!!    And please, if you're in a rush, be aware of others around you. Be polite, take a number, stand in line, say \"Please\" and \"Thank you\" and don't be selfish. The world doesn't revolve around you"}
{"text":"Amazing food and huge selection. Just make sure you get there before 4pm on the weekend or your options will be limited. Also, parking pretty much any time of the day is insane;they usually have a police officer directing traffic during the lunch hour which helps."}
{"text":"Fantastic place and everything is fresh and delicious.  Go early to avoid the rush of people."}
{"text":"If you like shopping at smaller grocery stores, and you like a cozy atmosphere, this is the place for you.  Apparently it's been a local institution for many years, my husband remembers it as a kid so it's been around for at least 25+ years.    Hot table looks delicious, we ordered macaroni and cheese and the fried chicken special with famous potato wedges. It was all very good, and the kids loved the mac and cheese. Lots of prepared food for lunch and quickly suppers and plenty of fresh bread.   It's a small store so the aisles can get a bit tight, parking can be a bit crazy, but it's well worth it.    Also worth noting, my daughter has a peanut allergy, and the kitchen was very helpful in finding which foods were safe and which were not."}
{"text":"Ah Monastery Bakery. As a tradesman in oakville I love getting jobs near Dorval and upper middle simply because it means Monastery for lunch.  The hot counter is always full of home made dishes. Usually 10 plus to choose from. They have also started doing hot carved or fresh grilled sandwiches at lunch. Hot brisket, carved strip loin,  and chicken have all impressed me!   Went for lunch on the weekend. I have never seen a police presence to deal with traffic at a bakery before but when it's this good there is no telling what people will do I guess. Lol.  Come one come all. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Some delicious take out and ready made food.  Great Bread!!  Parking lot is crazy, but worth it."}
{"text":"Out of the blue, I just had a craving for Monastery fried chicken and potato wedges.    This would not be particularly surprising had I eaten there recently.  But I haven't even been in (as opposed to  just *through*) Oakville at all in the last sixteen months.  Nor was the Monastery ever a particularly regular place for me to eat.  In fact, I've only had Monastery chicken maybe fifteen or twenty times in my entire life.  Still, this is the best fried chicken I've ever had.  Incredibly moist and beautifully seasoned.  The potatoes are generously seasoned and battered fluffy little wedges.  Nex time you're in Oakville, go there.  They also have a selection of very good baked items and both exotic and run-of-the-mill groceries."}
{"text":"Amazing! Used to go more often but they changed some of the recipes (soups, cheese sticks...) but still have good variety of food there"}
{"text":"What can I say ..?! Do not go on a weekend you will see many verbal altercations between patrons and security guards in the parking lot! prepared food and bread quality is good which is the sole reason I will come back however I will choose to come during the week."}
{"text":"This is a bakery place that almost everyone lives in Oakville knows. There are a variety of breads you can select from. Also they have hot food served for a quickly grab and go.  I love their dessert such as cheesecake and puff. Their bakery and juice are freshly made each day.  The only drawback is their parking lot is overly crowded. One time my car got scratched by another car who was trying to squeezes itself inside the tiny parking spot. Be aware of that!"}
{"text":"I love this place - they sell the best bread (baked on the premises) I have ever tasted.  It is always a treat to shop for the family breakfast on the weekend - their bagels and croissants are family favourites.  I love the selection at the deli too."}
{"text":"The bagels here are delicious. They have a nice bagel chew rather than the bland, bready texture that most bakeries try to pass off for their bagels. The macarons are on the small side (extremely small) and the texture is a bit dry. The macarons at Chocolate Alphabet on Kerr Street are much better and about twice the size.   The parking here is a bit hectic, even on a weekday."}
{"text":"Fresh breads, extensive meat and cheese selection, and a top-tier general grocery all in one. Every city needs this place.  I'm tempted to move back to Oakville just so I can shop here every day."}
{"text":"I heard many great things about Monastery and decided to order a birthday cake from them.    My timing was a little off, as I arrived shortly after a very indecisive customer who couldn't figure out what type, what size, what colour, etc. cake to order.  Luckily, Monastery's had a tray of samples and that kept me occupied for a while.  The girl at the counter was extremely helpful in helping me determine what size cake would be appropriate for the number of mouths I was feeding and she was able to have it ready for me for pick-up the very next day!  All my guests loved the cake.  I wouldn't recommend visiting Monastery's on an empty stomach, as you may find yourself purchasing more than you had initially intended.    Great selection at reasonable prices and everything is fresh!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. I started going for the breads, although they have so many types of bread, fresh baked, I often get yelled at when I come home for buying too much. Onion cheese pullapart, rye bread, olive bread, cheesy bread. I love their cranberry and white chocolate buns, their gingerbread cookies, their danishes, their...well. Everything baked.   High ratings as well for the deli meats - the Angus roast beef (Monastery's own) is amazingly tender. I could eat that every single day. The beef filets are also fantastic cuts that taste amazing, as are their pork roasts. We have tried the one with the stuffing inside and my husband and I were both so impressed.   Also love the samples. But there is one woman working there, who hands out samples sometimes, who is the most patronizing, annoying person I've ever encountered in a store. She was handing out mascarpone samples one day and she just started lecturing us on what soft cheese was, unprompted (we hadn't even spoken!). During this lecture, my husband and I just stood, silent, annoyed, while she ranted on and on, sometimes patting my husband on the arm to make a point. I wanted to say, \"Look lady, we know mascarpone. Please go away.\"   Except for her, everyone else is very friendly. And I keep going back, even if she does work there - in spite of her, in fact. Because it's all just too good to let one crazy lady spoil it for me."}
{"text":"Great bakery.  Don't park close to the entrance or on the road."}
{"text":"Easily the best chicken pot pies. The Guinness steak pies are great too!  This neighbourhood grocery store is always packed, and it's no wonder why... They have great service and the fine selection is Un-paralleled"}
{"text":"Fantastic bakery and deli selection! I usually drop by on weekends to pick up some cake slices for afternoon tea. There is also a small cafe section to enjoy a coffee or latte, however it is usually crowded and you'll be lucky to find a seat.   The bakery at the back of the store has a very wide selection of breads, sweet and savory pastries, cookies, etc. They also offer hot food and freshly squeezed juices. Handy for picking up a hot dinner when you don't feel like cooking.  The parking lot is a nightmare though - always crowded and nobody seems to know how to drive"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, the parking is a nightmare.  I know the location is great for me personally, but they really should have moved years ago to allow for bigger parking!"}
{"text":"Great bakery with great customer service. I have been to many bakeries however this one takes the cake ;). Their hot sausages are amazing and everything is so fresh. It is always super busy so try to go a little before closing.  The individuals who ran this place have ensured that the quality of their food never goes down and they always greet their customers with a smile. I am happy I found this little place of haven in Oakville."}
{"text":"I love Monastery. Their baked goods are phenomenal as are their fresh pizzas, deli meats, cheeses and take home platters. Every time I host a bbq or attend a pot luck, I get something from Monastery. Everyone thinks I have made it and compliment me on how good it is. Thanks Monastery ;)  The store is always clean, but it is so small. On a Saturday you cannot even move in there. It is frustrating and hard to try and find what you are looking for. Monastery does their best though by hiring staff to direct traffic outside so people can actually back out of parking spaces/park.   I would highly recommend going during the week, but if you have to go on a weekend, go early before it's a mad rush!"}
{"text":"Monastery isn't your typical bakery and deli - it must suffer from the Napoleon syndrome because it's massive! Much larger than any typical bakery and deli has a right to be. It's actually closer to a small local market.   With pastries, snacks and a coffee bar on one side of the super-bakery-deli, a hot table on the other which serves up some pretty awesome fried chicken (about a buck a piece), a large fresh bread and cake selection at the back and a huge assortment of cheeses and deli meats in the middle, this place is a huge hit will Oakvillians.   The banana bread ($8) is superb, and the coffee cake ($9) is pretty darn good as well.   Cookies ($1.50) are ok, nothing special. I'd pass on the somosas ($1.25 each) as well."}
{"text":"I love Monestary Bakery! I have fond memories of walking to the bakery everyday for lunch back in highschool, and now whenever I visit Oakville I make sure I drop in to get the potato wedges! They have expanded so much and are pretty much a grocery store, but it's the hot table I dream about! While everything looks visually appealing be careful as somethings don't taste as great as they look ( ie the made in house cakes). Otherwise it's an awesome family owned bakery that everyone in Oakville goes to!"}
{"text":"Not much more that I can say in praise of this place other than what has already been said.  Standouts for me are their chicken wings and wedges, chicken and pancetta and hot sausages.  I find their hot pasta dishes a tad too over cooked for my preference--I prefer my pasta al dente--bakery offerings are excellent in selection and quality--their donuts are very good although only a few flavors are offered.  Crazy busy 95% of the time unless you go immediately when they open and 5-10 mins before they close--and forget about going on a Sunday you will be lining up just to get into the driveway."}
{"text":"I miss my stay in Oakville. One of the best bakeries. Loved their breads, desserts and coffee."}
{"text":"I'm definetley a fan of this bakery! But it's more than a bakery, it;s an experience. And it's a very fun place to bring my two kids. I've never seen them get so excited about shopping! haha! Their cookies are to die for! My sunday routine always includes Monastery!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried is amazing! The chocolate symphony cake and macarons are to die for! Their breads are the best.  Don't even get me started on their donuts and pastries."}
{"text":"Its bread section is just heavenly.  Went there over the weekend for its sandwiches, pizza, pastries, cheese and coffee.  Oh the croissant was GOOD - buttery and flacky.  Cappucino was good too, and it's only $1.49 on sale.  We ended up buying more breads to take home.  Pastries were ok I found.  The cheesecakes looked good, but tasted average.  Will definitely go back for its breads."}
{"text":"Our workplace orders from here for Saturday - selection of meats and cheeses from the deli, some amazingly fresh baked cheese bread and buns (and a Glutino GF loaf for me) - it's like angels descended from heaven to deliver these delicious sandwich-makings in front us. Nothing puts a smile on everyone's face in the morning meeting like \"we're ordering from Monastery.\""}
{"text":"First time visit to Monastery. If all Monasteries offer baseball-size Rum Balls($0.99), I'm there!  Breads, breads and more breads.  Follow the sound of your stomach.  Jennifer K{-0.5 star} due to Rum Ball-related wastage. Hint at Happiness:  DON'T share Desserts with the aforementioned."}
{"text":"This little bakery was a surprise. Lots of desserts, and fresh meats and a hot table."}
{"text":"Le royaume du Français en manque de sa France, on y trouve de tout, du pain, jusqu'au saucisson! on peut aussi y manger des plats frais, y boire un café! Tout y est pour manger de la bonne nourriture!  En revanche si vous voulez manger de la bonne viande, n'achetez pas les sandwich pré emballés, ce n'est pas la meilleure viande du magasin à l'intérieur!"}
{"text":"A great bakery with fresh bread, desserts and an Italian hot table on top of being an over priced Italian grocery store.   I bought really good horseradish mustard, black olive pate and pesto here but other than that I can't comment on the grocery section.  Their hot table is well priced ($5.99 for lasagna, veal cutlet, $2.99 for soup, $8.99 for veal and pasta) they had ribs,  hot freshly made beef brisket sandwiches, rotesserie chicken and more. I had a hard time picking the 2 times I've been there. Both times included the veal and pasta combo and the 2nd time there was their Italian wedding soup, potato wedges, lasagna and chicken samosa.   Over all the food is pretty good, nothing wowing except the tomato sauce itself. Although I haven't rried the brisket sandwich yet.  Their bread selection is huge and very soft and fresh. We picked up 2 loaves and finished them that night.    Their Italian dessert cookies was a bit pricier than other Italian bakeries but that's oakville for you. The cookies were delicious and light, broke up when you put them into your mouth.   Awesome perk of free coffee when you're shopping in the store, even though I don't drink coffee.   Rmm to grab a number when you get to the hot table!"}
{"text":"Love love love the bakery and Deli. Now has a little coffee shop too!  Hot table makes a lazy night easy. Always something yummy her.  Ciao."}
{"text":"Oakville has a great bakery. And if you spend some time here you will know the name of that bakery. It's the most famous little neighbourhood bakery and I love it."}
{"text":"Good local place or grocery and takeout.  Not cheap."}
{"text":"Beautiful bakery. Lots of ingredients, lots of pre-cooked food you can grab for last minute occasions and parties   Anything from steaks, chickens, pastries, desert or cakes.   Place is often very busy, but kept very well organized. They have a coffee and food lounge area at the corner so you could eat what you just bought if you are starving :)  Did I mention CHESSE! These guy have every kind every invented. All you have to do is ask. Limited parking spaces though and customer are inconsiderate with shopping carts Ive seen and been a victim of them hitting cars in the lot."}
{"text":"Bought 2 pies, brownies and cupcakes to bring to a dinner, spent $60 on bland, bland food. The pecan pie tastes like nothing. Did not expect this from a bakery.... will not go back, do not recommend this at all."}
{"text":"A place where you always get \"fresh\" everything. They have a wonderful collection of delicacies, breads and cakes along with deli and cheese.  For me and my family that's the only shop for fresh seasonal fruit, flowers, cheese and cakes! Their coffee caramel chocolate chip cake is a must try.  For more variety you better visit them earlier in the day, they sell out fast. Prices are very economical yet parking may be a little hard, but not too bad, I always find a spot quickly."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, AMAZING desserts, deecent food, a great variety of fresh selection. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this place but I wish it was open longer :) thank you monastrry for being awesome"}
{"text":"The parking lot is abit of a nightmare, its small and takes ages to find a place. But once I step inside, I always head to the bakery section to see what cakes they have. The cheese cake is by far my favorite. Their hot dishes are pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"This place is famous in Oakville. You can't beat the quality of fresh made foods. Their bakery churns out amazing bread hourly. The pastas and other cooked foods are make from scratch on site. This place is cool."}
{"text":"Ordered: customized cupcakes with rosette icing and silver beads.  Review: I normally shop here for their baked goods such as pastries, bread, cheese, etc but recently I called their customer service to inquire about making customized cupcakes for my friend's upcoming bridal shower. Not only were their service very friendly, and courteous, they also called back to confirm details and follow up with any questions I had for them! Their prices are very decent and that's why I'm writing this part of this review: to spread the word on their nice service they offer behind the scenes.   Interesting tidbit: parking can be difficult here during weekends but there are ample street parking before the main entrance that is spacious and free!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my experience here. Both myself and my girlfriend went early one morning and they have so many choices for fresh breads and their prices were very fair. The cafe area was excellent and I felt again that price wise was affordable. I would recommend the place to anyone even if it means leaving your city to come here to try it out."}
{"text":"Love this bakery! Great deli section and baked bread. Parking lot is a nightmare though. The squeeze orange juice is the BEST! Reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Italian deli and bakery. Their back room with both savory and sweet pastry is not to Be missed. The hot table and pre made dinners? Yum!  And the pastries are outstanding. Out of the way but well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The parking lot is a seeming nightmare. Think Foodie Mart on a Saturday afternoon but with Oakville white people. But inside this store packed to the gills with bread and deli products it's well ordered. Best thing is they really do have lots of freshly baked bread products on sale for as cheap or cheaper you'll get at a grocery store. Love the $1 cappuccino special they have on for early birds."}
{"text":"I love this place. They do a cake that is mind bending called zflaglia. It's unbelievable. You must order it ahead as it's rarely ready made. Although I've been lucky on occasion.  Their deli section is excellent. So many hot selections. And baked goods are fantastic. You can also get many standard grocery items as well as specialty items. The staff are friendly and quite knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I've been to Monastery Bakery a few times, most recently to buy a birthday cake. The place was hoppin', so much so that they had a police woman directing traffic on a Sunday afternoon! It was kinda funny because the lot is so small, she looked pretty bored as customers more or less managed the situation on their own. That being said the parking is pretty limited but you'll probably find a spot since people are in and out fairly quickly. They had a good selection of cakes including Dufflet and other brands as well as their own cakes. They've recently expanded so there is a lot more to choose from. Needless to say you will not be disappointing, just don't be faked out by the door near the coffee bar, you can't go out it!"}
{"text":"I would like to give 4.5 starts but that isn't an option.   I do like Monastery as they have the best sliced sandwich meats in the area.  it is fresh and priced well.  They do have great breads and pies.   They used to have better baked treats years ago, but those seemed to have gone away and now they have started to sell more general grocery items.  But I go there mainly for the sandwich meats.  I would dock them a bit from some past experience where items were labeled incorrectly and I ended up having to go back into the store to to get the price corrected.  But the customer service people were really good and got the problems fixed."}
{"text":"Best tiramisu!  I stop in here before I head to work to make sure they don't sell out!  Biscotti are excellent too; my favourite being pistachio. The dessert counter is displayed very neatly, making it challenging for new customers to choose only 1-2 treats; I have yet to leave with less than 5 items. I love this bakery."}
{"text":"Was served a Chocolate eclair, let me tell you, I can get a better eclair from Tim Hortons. The whipped cream was FAKE!!! and the pastry part was flavourless and GROSS.  YUCK YUCK YUCK"}
{"text":"They make the most amazing tiramisu. And this is coming from a tiramisu addict. It is definitely my most favourite cake ever forever.  So ya, that's all you need to know. I judge a bakery by their tiramisu. If they can make it taste amazing, they can make everything else well too. And this is true of this place. I did manage to taste other things they make, eventhough I just want to eat tiramisu :)"}
{"text":"A heaven of freshly baked goods; all sorts of bread and croissants, spanakopitas, Danish croissants, chocolate croissants, olive bread, jalapeño bread, cookies, ham and cheese bites etc.   This place is like a bakery library. They also have fresh charcuterie and cheeses, as well as ready lunch and dinner options for take out."}
{"text":"Pazzo, pazzo, PAZZO!  Okay, what can I say 'bout this place that hasn't been written 'bout??  First, the name of this place is deceiving.  Expecting to walk into *just* a bakery, it was more like an Italian grocery store, complete with samples, a separate café section, a bakery (selling breads 'n buns) + a cakery (what do you call a display case with cakes, sweets, pastries??), AND a hot table all rolled into 1!  Even though it's located in a strip mall, Monastery is pretty expansive.  (The parking lot was jam packed!)  It's also easy to feel overwhelmed by the various counters, hustle 'n bustle of shoppers on a Saturday afternoon.  HOWEVER, for each counter, you do hafta grab a # for service, so it's fairly organised with civilised people - at least while I was there!  No pushing/shoving/grumbling/or cursing underneath-breath type behaviour.  After all, it's Oakville!  Tried:   -  some kinda triangular-shaped cake with a chocolate outside - good, light, fresh, not overly sweet -  cappuccino/latté ($1.69/weekend \"special\") - both good, enjoyed in-house in their café section where there was seating and it was quieter -  veggie sandwich ($4.99) - was toasted, tasted fine, but I wished that I had gotten something with meat in it! -  pesto pasta ($4.99) - pasta wasn't overcooked, el dente, but lacked pesto/parm flavour, a bit bland, but it was definitely FRESH! -  apple/cinnamon crumble coffee cake ($8.99) - took to a family dinner, delish, nice 'n light, not sugar overload, loads better than the crap at the grocery store  Tips:   1.  FREE COFFEE @ café counter while you \"shop\".  (I was sorta pissed that I noticed this sign AFTER ordering my latté/cap! :( ) This is AMAZING!  Whadda great way to encourage people to shop for longer. 2.  Some of the pastries run out quickly!  For cannolis/neopolitan, go earlier in the day, esp. on the weekends. 3.  If you want to enjoy your hot food, take it to the small seating area in the café.  You can also skip the line-ups by paying for your stuff there!  This is definitely a spot that I'd visit again to buy a loaf of bread and check out more of the hot table!"}
{"text":"The best bakery in the GTA, hands down!  Italian pastries, cakes and hot table, pies, cookies, bread...the selection is UNBELIEVABLE.  It gets so busy on the weekends that they have someone directing traffic in the parking lot - must try this place out!"}
{"text":"Great place but go early . People act like the recipe for bread has been lost . Pushing and shoving is part of the experience. Go early."}
{"text":"Best chicken parmigiana sandwich I have ever had,  incredible desserts  too, I think best specialty place in Oakville"}
{"text":"Foccaccias, n ciabattas, n jalapeno breads oh my!  This is not your ordinary bakery...it's more like a lifestyle! If I'm lucky, I get to go here every weekend and stock up the kitchen with all sorts of baked goodies for the week.  The breads are amazing, n the hot table is pretty damn impressive too!  While I've had better cakes elsewhere, this has easily become my go to bakery for greaty pastries.  My personal favorates here are the canolis and the chocolate mousse that comes in a chocolate cup.  Part of the problem for me is that while it isn't all that expensive, you get overwhelmed by the variety of breads, sweets, meats, n random ass things that you suddenly realize you cant live without. That's where the free samples kick you in the ass...cause one taste and your pupils dilate and you suddenly 'need' more! It's not uncommon to walk in for a loaf of bread n walk out with a $20 basket full of joy."}

You can also pick up your choices and put them in a tray for visiting your friends. They has some other ready to eat food that I will try next time."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me to this place and I've been addicted to it ever since.  Extremely reasonable pricing on the hot and frozen food. For someone like me who doesn't really like to cook and doesn't have a lot of time, this place is Amazing!!! If you've never been, once you go, you will be Hooked!!!"}
{"text":"Monastery Bakery has a really impressive selection of baked goods and they all priced reasonably!  Breads, sweets and more sweets.............  My Yelp Friend just couldn't take his eyes off the huge Rum Balls ($1) I wondering if it is the rum (eating rum instead of drinking it?) or the price or the size that attracted him? It was rich, creamy and yes full of rum........... remember don't feed that to your kids!!!  The smell of freshly baked bread is so comforting... and now I understand why locals keep coming back to Monastery Bakery for more...."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 2001 and have watched them expand into the monster bakery they are now. I love everything here. As you enter, they have free coffee for while you shop. The Cookie, pastry and cake selection is wonderful and is all so delicious.  They have an enormous deli section and will even custom make you a sandwich if you ask.  Let's move to the hot table. This is the most dangerous place if you are or are planning to be on any sort of diet. The food here is SO DAMN GOOD. They have these delicious brisket sandwiches that are to die for - that's if you make it past the mouth watering cheese tortellini and lasagna.  Having a kids party? Grab their fried chicken and wedges and move on - it's better than places who have made a business of only selling fried chicken. I always buy the litre of fresh orange juice here because it is squeezed in house right in front of you.  How can I write about a bakery without talking about the bread? They have a large selection of the most delicious bread around. Not too many preservatives so it does spoil quickly.  Monastery, I will keep making my pilgrimage to you for a long long time."}
{"text":"The cheese sticks are to die for!!!!! Their lasagna is to die for!!!! Actually anything there is to die for!!!! Parking lot might be the worst thing ever so park far away from the plaza if you are not the best at it."}
{"text":"This place excellent. Everything always fresh never doubt something you buy from here ."}
{"text":"This place has a huge variety of pastries and baked bread!  It's also a grocery store where you buy organic produce etc.  The pastries are so cheap as well compared to other similar groceries.  I bought a big slice of carrot cake for $2.5!!  Best to go early when things are baked fresh!"}
{"text":"Went here the other day after seeing so many good reviews. I made a mistake and went midday on a Saturday, line up's were huge I had to wait for 5 - 10min alone just to get a parking spot.   I got a Rye bread and some buns and a olive spinach bun or something. The buns were pretty good but the rye not so much. I am not a huge fan of the Italian bread so I didn't try that. The store is kind of divided into to section the back part are all the baked goods, breads and buns where as the front has all the meat and cheese and smaller selection of some grocery items.   They also had a little sample of some new croissants they made and they were pretty ok, I prefer the hard chocolate filling over the creamy one they offered.   I also found the place a bit on the priceyer side but then again it's in Oakville."}
{"text":"Easily one of the BEST PLACES to go if you want a little taste of Italy in your life!  The espresso bar feels like you are kicking off your day in Florence.  The bakery is absolutely incredible, from all types of fresh-baked breads, pastries, to an incredible sweets section.  The produce is always very fresh, there are great imported products from Italy, and the hot food section is perfect for a quick lunch or dinner.    I was almost scared to post this review as although it is very popular it can still be considered a hidden gem!  Amazing staff, service, food, espresso, and all-around experience!"}
{"text":"Always a great variety of baked goods, Quality meats and oils.  pizza fresh from the oven.  Hot table filled favorites and Many specialty items you expect from fine stores.  The Friendly helpful staff always eager to please.  You won't be disappointed.  Parking can get congested so plan your shopping times ahead. Cakes go fast so preorder."}
{"text":"I - LOVE - Monastery. I wish I could bold that statement. I love everything about this place - the amazing bakery, the fresh bread, the delicious meat selection, the free watermelon samples in the summer...SO. GOOD. I really recommend their mini cheesecakes and cheesey garlic bread. I always bring a box of their Italian cookies for my Mom, and she raves over them. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"the food is great. the bakery has just done some construction and has been expanded. it now has a tv and a small seating area. it is also only a 5 minuite walk form the catholic high school: St. Ignatius of Loyola"}
