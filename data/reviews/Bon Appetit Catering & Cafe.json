{"text":"I ordered a catered breakfast from Bon Apetit because our regular caterer couldn't do it on such short notice (we needed to order the day before). My first issue was that it took me 3 calls to get a confirmation of our order, I was sent the wrong invoice for someone else's order then finally about 6 hours later I have the correct confirmation in hand and we are ready for our breakfast at 8am the next morning. The food was mediocre at best, it was eggs, bacon, sausage and fruit. I appreciate the difficulty of catering this kind of food as it greasy and once off the heat tends to get a strange consistency, so I am lenient. the sausage was the worst in my opinion and needed a lot more time cooking. The fruit was good, but the cheapest options available, melon and grapefruit etc. The biggest issue for me and the reason I will not order here again is that it took 4, yes 4 (!!!!) days for them to pick up the leftover food and their dishes from our kitchen area!!!! This is totally unacceptable, we had old eggs sitting on the counter for 4 days! The delivery guy told me he would be back after lunch on Monday (the day of delivery) to pick up. He never showed, which has happened before so I let it go figuring he would be by in the morning. Well he came by but before business hours, I got his msg and called their office, to which I was told someone would be by the next day because their driver had left. So now we are at Wednesday, no one comes. I call Thursday morning and was told someone will come the next morning. SO here it is Friday morning and someone comes by and grabs them, no explanation or apology. I need to add that our office is in the same quadrant of the city and not that far from Bon Appetit, yet no one in their office could come by the get the 2 dishes that were rotting on our counter....

Just avoid. there are better options"}
{"text":"This place is good... really good!  i ordered a clubhouse and fries and my club house was a chicken breast on a nicely toasted baguette  crisp lettuce and thick bacon.. the fries were nice and crispy and seasoned just right, service was done well also. i will be going back"}
{"text":"I really didn't want to review this place, cause I'm scared it'll get uber popular. My co-workers took me here for breakfast. Didn't even know there was a restaurant their and I drive by that place all the time.

First off, get ready for the smallest sit-down menu selection ever. I believe their were only 7 options, but besides that, everything else is top shelf!! Huge portions, Great prices ($13 was the top priced item) and great quality; they only use fresh farm eggs from free-range chickies, so if you've only seen yellow egg yokes, get ready to see/taste what eggs are really meant to be. They also make their own jams, and they give you 7 different types of it!!!

I love this place...but don't tell no one, I like how quiet and awesome, it currently is"}
