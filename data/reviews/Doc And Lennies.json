{"text":"Had meatloaf, corn casserole, and coleslaw...ultimate delicious comfort food.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A great hole-in-the-wall soul food joint right on the southern edge of the Cleveland Clinic campus. Good menu with great prices, the only downer was that the service was slow, as there was only one waitress and one cook. 

Food was delicious, and portions were generous. My friend had the fried chicken sandwich and you could tell it was pounded out and breaded right there and then. They're not kidding when they say biggest in town - this thing was about twice the size of the bun, and almost bigger than his face. 

I had the special of the day which was 2 whole chicken wings and fried fish - (your choice of perch or catfish) with fries and coleslaw. If I hadn't have checked Yelp on my phone, I would NEVER know this place was even there. A good little find not many people know about - kinda hope it stays that way!"}
{"text":"Had the catfish and Mac and cheese. OMG!! What an awesome first meal in Cleveland. Not a slaw person, but it was good. Service was friendly. We felt like we were eating at a friends house."}
{"text":"Stopped in based on reviews and the food was amazing and the service was fast and friendly!!"}
{"text":"This is near the Cleveland clinic on Cedar Avenue in Cleveland and has very reasonably priced meals. The staff is very pleasant. the place was clean and nicely decorated. The food and service were excellent 

We were in and out in a little over a half hour with a total tab of $12 tip included. You should try it."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at reasonable prices!  5 full wings and 2 sides about $7.00! Wait staff was polite and wager to serve. A must stop for fish or seafood!"}
{"text":"I've kept this place a secret unto myself because the precious. We all have those places that we've discovered and want to hide from everyone else. This is that place. I have to share it because I have cognitive dissonance over not sharing. What if *greater power forbid* it went out of business? I would blame myself.

Onto the review:

Look at those stars. Five of them. The rare albino peacock of ratings for me. Should I go on to explain that this is, hands down, Symon groupies please close your eyes, the best barbecue in Cleveland? It is. The sauce is just the perfect amount of tangy and spicy, without any gloppy sweetness. The brisket sandwich makes you want to never stop eating it. You will dream about it. The coleslaw, perfectly seasoned, and crisp. That's a sure sign it's made daily, with love. There is nothing on the menu I wouldn't recommend. The daily specials are great deals too.

On the outside it has just the right sketchiness. This place is next door to the Cleveland Clinic emergency room. It's a building one would never think twice to look at. Inside the exposed brick gives you an almost New Orleans feel. The decor is, well it is what it is. Quaint, yes let's use that word. 

The staff is among the friendliest around. True Clevelanders. This is a place where you phone an order in, they tell you ten minutes, and twenty minutes later it's ready, and you simply do not care. Not when the food is this good.

So there, I shared my precious. But I may have one or two more around."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of the building fool you, the inside is tastefully interior designed, the staff is sweet and attentive, and the food is amazing! And can't beat Free Fry Friday!"}
{"text":"I've been using Yelp for a while, but have never been inspired to leave a review. I made an account specifically for Doc & Lennies, because it deserves a five-star review. The food was absolutely amazing, and reasonably priced. Order the ribs...they're breathtaking."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall
Very friendly 
Great home cooking of soul foods
Great veggies, fish and ribs, etc
Large portions 
Very clean 

This place is in a short walking distance from the Cleveland Clinic, literally adjacent to the campus. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Waited a long time for lunch and it took a while to be waited on.  I was given one piece of wonder bread for my fish sandwich and I had to ask for the other slice and the other toppings.  Fish was good and fries were ok.  The wait, d√©cor, and inside did not seem very clean.  Not impressed.  I felt like I bought a meal out of someone's home kitchen."}
{"text":"Good place; service is slow so you might want to call ahead.  Food is a bit saltier then i prefer but overall it is a good mom-and-pop type place."}
{"text":"The fried catfish was one of the best I have tasted and I travel for my job (better than Memphis fried catfish). The hush puppies were light and not greasy. I would recommend paying the uncharge and get the macaroni and cheese instead of the fries for the dinner, (the fries were good-my husband got those) the macaroni and cheese was outstanding! One last point, the coleslaw was also outstanding, not too much mayonnaise...I hate that!

My son got the grilled chicken salad. The chicken was seasoned nicely and the lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers were fresh and crispy. 

There is free parking...another plus to the side of the building. The lot is always full with cars of Cleveland Clinic employees. It is OK to double park there...

The only negative comment I have is there are no regular tables on the first floor...just high tops and tight booths if you are a larger person. All the tables are on the second floor...and having double knee replacement surgery wasn't going to climb up stairs for a table. They were nice enough to bring a chair for me to sit, but I am sure that is going to be a problem in the future. I still gave them 5 stars...the food was that good."}
{"text":"My 6 year old loved sitting at a hi top table gobbling down his hot dog and grape soda. The mac n cheese was great and homemade. For the price, screw the chains and support something local."}
{"text":"We are from the south and were here for our dads surgery.  This was one of the best places we ate the entire time.  Everything we had was delicious.  Meat loaf, burgers, pork chop sandwich and daily special wings and catfish.  We are a picky group, but I would absolutely recommend anyone go to this restaurant.  It looks like a hole in the wall, but trust me you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Cedar road diner
Baloney sandwich for lunch
You just can't beat it

A solid, clean mom and pop diner on E83 and Cedar, right behind the Cleveland Clinic's emergency room parking lot. Clean and with a big personality for sure. Solid smoked pork shoulder sandwich, fresh cut fries, and fried baloney. FRIED BALONEY!!!! Food of the gods. Breakfast, brunch, lunch, and did I mention FRIED BALONEY? I hear the luau theme night is wild.
No, seriously, there i9s a luau night, and a comedy night.  And a \"jazz brunch\".
And the bathroom is clean too.


Carry on."}
{"text":"Not sure if this counts as a full review. I've only been here 1X. If I go again it will only be because of this story. 
Another customer came in while I was waiting 4 my meal to be prepared. They cook everything to order. 
He came in & didn't greet anyone. \"You already know what I want. Give me that Moby Dick\"!

They boast the largest fish sandwich in Cleveland. I haven't had it but an obviously regular customer seemed pretty excited about it."}
{"text":"food was extremely good and it was delivered to my address off W.25th St"}
{"text":"Holy Cow, this place is incredible. Believe the reviews. Went here with wife and daughter and had the best fish sandwich of my life. Daughter had loaded fries. It looks like somewhere you'd drive by, but do not be deceived. We had a great chat with two sweet ladies. One of them told us about her brother who makes everything. Such nice folks. Makes a long trip to the Cleveland Clinic much nicer. God Bless."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  Stopped by for lunch during an Anesthesia Conference at Cleveland Clinic. Had the daily special of smoked brisket over garlic mashed potatoes with cole slaw and baked beans.  I can't tell you how delicious the food is, especially the baked beans which are the, best I've ever had in my life. The place looks a little run down from the outside, but that's where you always find the best food anyway.  Oh, and Lennie is the sweetest most welcoming hosts I've met, really makes you feel like family.

I'm sure everything is good here, but seriously, get the baked beans."}
{"text":"Ok I will admit.. Hubs and I did a double take when we pulled up. Decided to go for it..and oh my gosh I am so glad we did! I ordered the Lenny burger and hubs got perch sandwhich..wow..  Mac n Cheese is nothing that came out of a box! Homemade and fabulous! Slaw..yep...homemade and so yummy! Cheeseburger was very good...fish was so incredibly yummy! I think I liked the fish a bit better than the burger. The breading was light and crispy!  Staff are all very friendly! Making sure all is well several times! If you are in a hurry hurry I am not sure this is for you but if you want amazing homemade food....this is your place!!"}
{"text":"This is a short walk from the Cleveland Clinic. True homemade food. Definitely a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Unread about Doc and Lennies on a list of the most important restaurants in Cleveland, so I made a recent visit with some friends.

The environment is plain, but inviting. The beautiful ladies created is warmly at the front and the service was friendly and efficient.

The food was mediocre. I ordered fish and it was poorly fried. Low heat rendered the fish greasy and in appetizing.

I also order some sort of special corn which was no more then canned corn with peppers added - not good.

My friend got the burger which was large and delicious  (I tried it) the others ordered bbq which they were satisfied with.

Overall, this is probably not a place that I would frequent, but the history is worth at least trying it out."}
{"text":"Amazing; perfect within the cuisine.  Best food I've had in Cleveland, and the first for which I've taken the time to leave a review.

Edit:  They remembered me from a month ago!  Really, the welcome here is exceptional."}
