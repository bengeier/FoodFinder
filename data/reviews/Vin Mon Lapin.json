{"text":"I went at Vin Papillon recently and I was more than happy to see a similar place coming in my hood, from the same bunch of people (Joe Beef and Liverpool House also). I highly anticipated the opening. We went on their first Saturday and arrived at 5 pm. People made fun of me because we were the first (I insisted to be there as soon as the door opened) but within 15 minutes it was packed (so I was right !) The food was awesome ! I was happy to see their version of the ham & cheese they have at Vin Papillon. However, I preferred the one at Vin Papillon, this plate is a must ! Our favorite was the pink salad with shaved fois gras. The preserved mushrooms in the raw scallops dish were also to die for. Lots of nice discoveries, flavors and the wine was also as good as the food. The service and staff was on point even if they just opened. This is a nice neighborhood restaurant that will become my new favorite place for sure."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to check out MacMillan's 4th location that opened around 2 months ago. This little trendy wine bar doesn't take reservations! so given the line up I had with Joe Beef - I didn't want go take a chance on losing my spot. I was there by 17h10 and low ans behold I was lucky to say I was first in line. The wait was not long-maybe 10 mins before we got seated. I admired the Alice in Wonderland themed window art and tall Costco sized wine bottles that decorated the window sill.  The venue is cozy and small -pretty identical to McMillan's other locations. The design is very similar actually, with a corner bar and the option of hanging your coats along the long side hallway.   Unlike Joe Beef, the menus here are printed and change on a daily basis. Although printed, I don't think it really made a difference because I still had no Idea what the items were. Alex, our host did a fine job of summarizing out daily specials and we did not have to ask! The local wine menu was also written on a mirrored wall for your viewing pleasure (printed as well). All featured item were from local suppliers from the city, which seems to be a local cause supported by the owners (watch Antony Bourdain's  Montréal layover episode- you'll know what I mean).  Dishes are meant to be shared, ranging in pricr from 7-24$. Wines starting at 7.50$ /glass. I ordered the scallops with a rhubarb sauce-12$ (2/5) -the presentation was beautiful on this dish - although quite small(literally one scallop cut into 3 pieces -good diet food), the hint of rhubarb was really appreciated.   2) the raw goat cheese curd with puntarelle-13$ (a bitter green) topped with an anchovy oil vinaigrette (3/5) - this dish was quite nice - not your typical goat cheese but the saltiness from the anchovies, bitterness from the greens and curds of the cheese balanced out well.  3) Hochelaga oysters, Calamari and squid ink-19$ for the win (4/5) I call this item Rorschach 's art. The dish is completely back like activated charcoal when it is served- you almost think it's burnt! But fear not - squid ink is like the black swan in your mouth - really adds a beauty to this dish - eccentric on its own.   4)smoked eel Carbonera pasta dish-22$ (1/5) this dish was way too heavy on the black pepper that's all we tasted! The chef was nice enough to give us another serving with less pepper but it was still strong.  5)So we ordered the mini bread loaf from topinambours served with a sweet sunflower margarine-6$(4/5) worth every cent. I am glad we ordered as a side for the Carbonera.  Desserts! 6)polenta icecream with a Berry sorbet 11$ (2/5) I wasn't impressed by this dish as anything original.  That's why we ordered a 2nd dessert: 7) meringue with field Berry purée -10$ (5/5) a must! It was so light and flavourful - I would not share this dish lol!  I also had two glasses of white wine - I don't remember the names because I didn't capture a pic of the menu! But the cheapest one! (You have to when your bill is over 130$) jk.  This was a definite cool spot to check out for my foodie friends!"}
{"text":"Had such a sweet joyful surprise of walking by Vin Mon Lapin and seeing the doors open for the first time, and getting to enjoy the very first service of this beautiful new Little Italy addition to the Joe Beef, Liverpool House, Vin Papillion family.  The space is cosy and perfect, the leather benches are comforting and low enough that everything kind of feels like a family party.   The service is the highest caliber; so friendly and charming and professional and quick and smooth. Always nearby, never rushing, making dining dreams come true.   Most importantly the wine and food. We ordered basically every not-raw, pescatarian menu item to meet our table's needs, and we loved what tried, and were happy we could eat well even with restrictions. There really weren't vegan options though, so careful there, and not a lot of fresh vegetable flavours. The emphasis is on rich local ingredients. We loved the mushroom bolognese on toast, so impeccably fresh and rich and delicate. Everything was good but that was the most memorable dish for me, so I'll leave you the rest to discover for yourselves. I love the emphasis here on natural wines, there are so many incredible flavours to discover and your waiters can take you through a universe of options. We tried a rose sparkling that was dry and bright and really special.   They are open now, and not doing reservations, so just go!"}
{"text":"Vin Mon Lapin is my idea of the perfect little neighborhood bar:  Mags of natural wine by the glass and bottle Absurdly good and affordable food  Rampant and cozy conviviality Everything and everyone is good looking Tremendous service  Enchanté, Vin Mon Lapin. J'aime ça!"}
{"text":"Brace yourself, Little Italy has finally a restaurant worthy to make any WOP proud of their neighbourhood. This Joe Beef family restaurant is truly regal in each and every way - from appetizer to dessert. A Canada Top 100 without a doubt.   TIP: the place is pretty snug and they don't take reservations. Be there before 7pm and you  should get a table pretty quickly."}
