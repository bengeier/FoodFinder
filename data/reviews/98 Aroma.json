{"text":"Had high hopes for this dish since it was recommended to us, but it was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT. The shrimp was not fresh to begin with and clearly over cooked after. It has none of the sweetness of well prepared shrimp and all of the fishy taste of leftover seafood. The texture was mealy and the Unami factor was nonexistent. All of the garlic that the chef put on the shrimp to mask the poor quality of the ingredient only accentuates the failing of this dish. 

The other dishes were good though, only this one was horrid"}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food! Nice atmosphere and very clean compared to other places."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here tonight. Order the cauliflower dish, it was amazing! Most authentic flavors I've  had outside of China in a while. We really like all of our other dishes as well. Especially their signature salad. Place was really busy so you may have to wait, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Fresh, imaginative food and wonderful service. We just walked by and decided to try it. You should too!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a colleague, was pleasantly surprised by the old China decor upon walking in. Hard to come by in Chinatown with restaurants with decor this exquisite. Bathroom is sanitary. 
Price is on the more pricy side as to be expected. As a comparison, dishes are on average $2-$4 more expensive then DaYaLi. Portions are average but not tiny by any means. I'd say for 3 people 3 dishes (1 big,2 medium) would be more than enough. 

Service was not very friendly and even made us feel borderline uncomfortable. The host (perhaps the manager) greeted us without eye contact or a smile. Got our dishes mixed up once too. Did not offer to change plates throughout nor checked up on us, there weren't even that many people in the restaurant that time.

Notable dishes:
-steamed tilapia -pretty damn great-the e-fu noodles (added for $3.99) are absolutely worth and enhance the flavour of the whole dish. The spiciness is spot on but definitely not for the faint of heart.
-summer breeze salad -very unique and flavourful dish. The taro chips are def the star of the show

Others: the much raved-about XiaoLongBao (not much meat stuffing) and pork n sticky rice (too salty) w/steamed buns are just so-so."}
{"text":"The best place to eat REAL Chinese food near UofT. 

I've seen how this restaurant develop since last year. 

No matter you prefer spicy or not. It should be your first choice for Chinese food.

The only reason that the feedback is fewer than what it should be is because of the fact that many people like me, just love coming here for food, but not a fan of commenting it.

Spicy:
Xinjiang Dapan Chicken.
Suancai Fish

Non-spicy:
Jinsha Ju Red potato
Yummy stewed multi-fungi & tofu 
Traditional sesame riceball with Gouqi in Guihua Wine soup (homemade mother style)
Dumplings ( better and safer than cross-street)"}
{"text":"Bad Serivce. The manager is sort of rude and the servers don't even give you spoons when serving soups unless you spend 5 minutes waiting for a server to have time to give you one. 10 out of 10 would not recommend."}
{"text":"The taste is really good! And the environment is quite awesome. I love Chinese Sichuan Cuisine."}
{"text":"Had a very nice meal here with good friends for Chinese Nee Year. The food was delicious. The staff were very nice! :)"}
{"text":"Great! I love the taste! The food is fresh and service is perfect! I would like to go back sometimes somedat. By the way, I liked the dried pot though it's spicy."}
{"text":"So for my birthday, I wanted to hit up Canton Chilli or New Ho King for some cheap fried rice...  BUT we walked past this place and was intrigued by the beautiful traditional wood interior.  Really happy we decided to check it out!!  This is a definite date place for those looking for some place nice, memorable, delicious and affordable :) 

Most people think Chinese food is just the yummy fried rice, spring rolls, stir fry veggies and meats served by the many very cheap late night Cantonese-Canadian places in Chinatown.  It's so much more than that.  In fact, it's actually kind of hard to find the type of amazing food with complex flavouring served in Mainland China in downtown Toronto.  98 Aroma definitely filled this void and then some.  

The menu had lots of choices BUT only 2 sides so you don't feel overwhelmed.  They definitely refined the dishes!  We ordered: 
- the shrimp chives dumplings: big, juicy and just the right thickness of dough to be transluscent but intact.  Lots of chives and shrimp.  Big enough to be an entree on its own.  (The plate was really cool - it had a plastic sieve at the bottom to catch the liquids so the dumplings would stay hot and moist but the bottom would not get soggy and fall apart.)
 
- black fungus and cucumber: (refreshing, crunchy, large portions and great balance of vinegar and garlic just like my mom's dish - goes well with rice)  

- corn and nuts (not a usual Chinese dish but definitely get try this.  It's a big serving of roasted sunflower seeds and pine nuts with carrots and peas on a bed of corn.  We were wowed by the complexity of this simple looking dish.  It had the creaminess of the corn, and the smokey pine nut taste but also had a delicious third salty-hoison-y sauce that we were wowed by.  If that made sense!) 

- \"beef burrito\" (this is actually a jianbing/crepe wrapped around slices of marinated five spice beef, scallions and I think lettuce, with Peking/Beijing duck sauce!  So delicious!  I have seen a similar dish in China and so happy to find it here.)

- rice (of course.  It went so well with the corn and nuts and the fungus.)

This was more than enough for 2 and we even packed a full take out container (a beautiful recyclable and microwaveable see through hard plastic box - not styrofoam yay!).

Service was great.  The server was attentive and friendly.  The owner (?) even came up to us to ask how things are since it's a new restaurant.  It seems like they really care about the patrons - so different than other places in Chinatown.  (Hey both styles are great, but I'm glad that Chinatown Chinese restaurants are finally diversifying!)

The ambience was very calm, with many private booths, and the setting was beautiful.  Stone walls with stone carving inlays, and beautiful traditional looking wood ornaments.  The tableware was nice china dishes and plates, with nice giftware chopsticks.  Definitely an insta-worthy place - hint hint :D 

I'm a very frugal eater but even I would say the price of $39 after tax and a pop was well priced given we had 5 items and a drink, the portion sizes are big, the ambience was beautiful, service was great, and the food was very well prepared. 

Definitely check it out!  There's a reason why many more patrons were Chinese compared to  the other Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.  This is a seriously good place."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch at 98 Aroma yesterday.  The service was wonderful and  we had the most delicious hot and sour soup.  Their speciality wings are fantastic too...very spicy!! I'll be going back for sure to try the other dishes.  
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Based on some good reviews  from Yelp ,I decided to go try the restaurant yesterday.
IT was a totally  big disappointment.
The server was extremely unpleasant with a Don't  Care Less attitude, the worst I have ever experienced: no basic manner at all.
Lychee Shrimp - nothing special.
Marinated beef, spicy version- adequate.
I was very shocked that this restaurant has all the 5 Star rating!I wonder how genuine the reviews are!!!!!"}
{"text":"My Mom and I are on vacation and came into Chinatown for lunch. This restaurant is definitely the place to go!!! The staff is friendly, the food is very authentic, the dishes are huge and the service is right on time. Ask for Sean for your server and tell him Renee from South Carolina sent you."}
{"text":"Lovely spot, thank you Yelp! This resto lived up to the hype, with great ambiance, friendly and down to earth wait staff, a manager who cares, and terrific and savoury food. Would we come back? You betcha! See you in September, 98 Aroma"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Rude and inattentive servers. Soup wasnt bad but the mushroom and broccoli was swimming in cheap oil. Had to leave most of it.
I then got told off by my server for wanting to pay by debit."}
{"text":"*3.5/5

98 Aroma is the new Chinese restaurant that offers fine dining Northern Chinese cuisine at the heart of Toronto's downtown Chinatown.

Travelling Foodie Tip: They have free parking!

COCKTAILS
For cocktails, I liked the Long Island Iced Tea here because you can actually taste how strong the alcohol is and it's not overly sweet like in other places.

APPETIZERS
Since it's Northern Chinese, you MUST order their buns/dumplings. The Pan Fried Pork Buns were amazing and I highly recommend. They remind me of Xiao Long Bao but using buns with crispy exterior and chewy interior.

I highly recommend their addicting Signature Handmade Pancake!

MAINS
I found the mains to be delicious overall. I'd say my most favorite here was the Steamed Tilapia Fish. Perfectly steamed and slathered in chili sauce, the tilapia was very fresh and juicy but it can be quite spicy depending on your tolerance.

One thing I was surprised to find out was that the The Lion Head Meatball is made of pork and not beef, though I found it tasted like beef.

Fried Salt & Pepper Calamari isn't your typical fried salt & pepper calamari as the calamari wasn't dry batter, though it was still crispy.


DESSERTS
Dessert was the most underwhelming for me especially after the enjoyable appetizers and mains.

The Coconut Milk with Sweet Rice was a bit off for me. I didn't really taste much coconut flavour, which is what I was looking for.
I liked the Rice Dumpling the most as it is as I expected it to be. And the Rice Dumpling was really good.


OVERALL
Being new to the scene, there is so much potential to this place especially being one of the more unique Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.
Service was pretty good here which is generally uncommon for Chinese restaurants. Food is well deservingly good though having issues with dessert."}
{"text":"The decor is super nice. The food is good, but a bit pricy. We ordered the black pepper beef, handmade pancake, and pan fried rice noodle. The black pepper need has a nice coconut/creamy taste to it, very unique and different from other places. The handmade pancake is really crispy and soft, definitely worth a try. Service is great. It's one of those places I would recommend a friend to try at least once, but I won't be a regular."}
{"text":"Great traditional Chinese restaurant. Best hot and sour soup we're ever tasted. Nice atmosphere, and clean. The owner is exceptionally friendly. Above and beyond customer service."}
{"text":"Quite a nice place to sit down and enjoy fine Chinese cuisine. The interior is clean, intimate and well decorated--much fancier than your average Spadina restaurant. The food is quite good, and though the dishes seem pricey, the portions are actually quite large. I'd say 2 dishes per 3 people would have everyone comfortably full.

We ordered the boiled fish in chili oil, which seemed to be a popular dish to order. The fish had great texture but the chili oil didn't add as much flavour to the fish as I'd expect. It was also a tad spicier than I'd have liked, making it harder to eat more, but I'm generally not the most spice-tolerant either. 

The mixed vegetables with beef was a great stirfry, really tasty and the meat was tender.

Overall, food was authentic, service was good, the restaurant has great atmosphere. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight after reading some great reviews about this place. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is very relaxing and the waiter was very friendly and quite handsome! (I promised I would write that!) All kidding aside, I highly recommend you visit this place as it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"98 aroma was amazing. We had our buddy Jerry take us. He is from Sichuan province in China. I asked him to show me the most authentic food in Toronto that he has found. He took me here! We got a little bit of everything. We got a tofu dish(better than I expected by far). A spicy beef dish (not too spicy). A cold chicken dish(tasty but the fat coagulates when it's cold and is like eating jelly). And vegetable soup(it had pork and chicken in it so be careful). The taste was 10/10 and so was the service.l, however I didn't do any of the ordering as Jerry ordered everything in mandarin. Very authentic. Very impressed."}
{"text":"It's a good restaurant. Very authentic Chinese food?I give five stars. I will recommend more friends to come here."}
{"text":"98 Aroma serves refined Northern Chinese cuisine. However, my experience was anything but refined. Let's start with the positive. The restaurant is clean and the decor is better than most of the restaurants on Spadina. However, the above average decor for a restaurant on Spadina does not make up for poor service and average food. 

The service was so bad that it was actually comical. While the servers were nice, it was clear they did not know what they were doing. It took them a while to acknowledge us when we first walked in. It took them even longer to sit us. We almost left. 

After we were seated, we had to ask for the menus. Then, we had to flag the server down to take our order because our server was checking in on us. Our table was not set correctly. Essentially, the servers were bumbling their way through dinner service. 

We ordered spring rolls and fried tofu to start. For mains, we ordered stir fried beef, stir fried mushrooms and broccoli and kung pao tofu. The food was average. The portion sizes were reasonable, but the prices were higher than the other restaurants in the area. 

I was not overly impressed with the experience."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic Chinese food, love the old traditional setting. Make sure to make your reservation as the store would get pretty busy"}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant twice with a Chinese friend who could read their Chinese menu, and the experience was great both times. 

The restaurant is new and clean, and the food is amazing. I highly recommend the fish with sour cabbage soup, the eggplant with potato and green peppers, and the beef with potato dish. I fish and sour cabbage soup is different, but surprisingly delicious and I couldn't stop eating it. The portions are also huge for the price and the quality is great.

I often have cravings for the flavours of this place."}
{"text":"They charge you tips after tax. Talked to the waiter and he blamed the owner for telling them to do so. He even brought a calculator to our table and did the math to tell us how much we should pay lol. 

Also funny that they said very specially 12% tips is minimum, and they charge you tips (after tax) because many customers do not pay tips, so they need to make sure their waiters get paid tips.

Food was alright. Too greasy and spicy to my taste. The decor and atmosphere is not bad, but they really need to work on their service."}
{"text":"Very nice decor! friendly service! and the owner came to each table to ask if the the dishes taste good. the sour fish soup was delicious!! tho very little fish in it, mostly soup and super salty picked vegetables

the cucumber dish (pai huanggua) was tasty flavour-vise. but made of saggy cucumbers tho.. so the texture wasn't great. 

the dish made of pork slice (covered with flours and deep fried and swim in sweet sauce) was so-so. Too oily, and the sauce was way too sweet for Chinese taste (they offered a different menu for Chinese, presumably more authentic, so i was disappointed about the overly sweet sauce) 

the sweet rice dumpling (tangyuan) (filled with sesame paste) was good (altho my friend didn't like it, she said it didn't have enough filling compared to what her mom made, who is a shanghainess.... not a fair fight on that particular dish lol) 

Overall good experience. but will probably go to Anne's magic kitchen for equally tasty food with cheaper price. At here, for 2 girls, the bill came out as $40 before tips."}
{"text":"5/5 venue. Super clean (even the washrooms) for a Chinatown establishment and beautiful interior design -- traditional Beijing palace style! Super cool place to take a date or someone not so familiar with the Chinese culture for an \"authentic\" experience.......

But 3/5 food. Why? No major flaws with taste or quality, but unfortunately the dishes are just kind of boring. The regional cuisine served here is northeastern Chinese, which is my specialty since I hail from Shandong, as do the owner and some of the staff! I find the dishes very clean in that I feel that 98 Aroma uses less corn starch, oil, sodium, and possibly MSG than many other Chinatown restaurants.

3/5 value. Portion sizes are reasonable, but don't expect anything huge that would last for a week for under $10 like at House of Gourmet, etc. Pricier than most Chinese restaurants, but 98 Aroma can get away with this since they do have a swankier and more fusion feel. Think R&D, but with more Chinese-influence. A good place to take your Caucasian coworkers or in-laws, but not to dine alone just because. 

A few notes about specific dishes-

1. I've had the soups here before and the Hot & Sour soup is actually a huge portion even as a small size. The delicate mushrooms soup is not as substantial, so cannot stand alone as a meal.

2. Do order the Summer Breeze Veggie Salad (vegan) -- and make sure you MIX it well as all the sauce (and flavor) is at the bottom of the bowl. $9.99. Big portion, enough to share between 2 people or have as a lighter meal. I loved the textures and glass noodles.

3. Very mediocre Assorted Delicate Veggies (vegan). Broccoli, celery, carrots, and fried tofu. $14.99. Way too basic.

4. My gfs had the scallion pancakes, which looked more cooked and crispier than the ones my mom makes at home, but gfs enjoyed these. 

5. Can't remember the menu name, but gfs ordered a huge ass chicken udon stew, which was massive. They really liked the chicken and flavors here. 

6. Fried green beans with minced beef -- beans were oily and gfs weren't a fan. $13.99.

They take credit, debit cards at no extra charge. We didn't make a reservation for 7PM on a Friday night and were seated immediately, so customer volume is definitely not as high as it used to be a year ago.

Overall, would return, but only with Chinese food novices or for a special occasion."}
{"text":"great place for reunion and a cup of drink after work! Love the dishes and environment"}
{"text":"We made the trip to Chinatown specifically to try this place out, as per a friend's recommendation. Walking into this restaurant was literally a breath of fresh air. Maybe b/c it's one of the newer ones, but inside has such a imperial setup.  Mostly spacious with good ventilation and SEATS!! compared to a lot of take-out places in Chinatown. They even had a bar on the inner half of the restaurant with a marbled table that lit up orange O_O; Here are my top 3 favourites (in no particular order):

1. Summer Breeze (Signature Veggie Salad) ~$9.99 -taro crisps, sweet-potato noodles (Woo See in canto), leeks, bell-peppers, red cabbage, radishes, onions, and carrots that are all julienned! it had a delightful sweet-salty vinaigrette dressing. I loved this salad a lot!

2. Steamed Garlic Shrimp ~$18.99 I don't like shrimp, and I don't like chili oil, but this dish made me love both of it. Good quality shrimp with the heads attached (ALWAYS a plus), and the grated garlic was cooked and added this flavour that literally tasted like that delicious purpley shrimp paste in a jar you add to tung choy. Also instagrammable with their presentation

3. Pan Fried Pork Buns (6 pcs) ~$9.99  OH MAN THIS WAS SUPERB! Juicy on the inside and super crispy on the outside. Probably used dark meat on the inside because it had a resilient texture. Didn't even need to dip any sauce. 

Also if you like to eat spicy food, try the Steamed Tilapia Fish with Chopped Bell Chili ~$29.99
All my friends loved this dish and even threw in some e-fu noodles b/c the sauce was that good! Apparently it's the restaurant's signature dish too..  The dish was massive and heavy.. it took up most of the table lol!

TL;DR If you like Northern Chinese food, fine-dining, and affordable prices, it's worth the trip :D !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Initial impression based on the host/waiter's response to me - not warm and inviting. We ordered the pan fried dumplings, steamed buns and spicy chicken wings. The dumplings were good (the ones that didn't get burnt on the bottom), the buns so so. While the flavour of the wings was great, two pieces were undercooked so we sent it back and the waiter said a new batch would be started. By the time they came out we were done with the meal so asked for it to be boxed. Upon inspection of the wings at home, it appeared that they either gave us the scraps, or they chopped up perfectly good wings into a bunch of little pieces. Either way, you need to hire a cook that knows how long to properly cook regular sized wings. Needless to say, we won't be heading back. Do yourself a favour and go to any of the other restaurants in Chinatown. We sure wish we had."}
{"text":"I don't agree of all these good reviews.  The food is below average and definitely over priced .  Service is good but definitely not worth 4 stars"}
{"text":"Good food! Very authentic traditional Chinese food. Would definitely recommend! Egg drop tomato soup was really good, I get it almost every time. The spicy fish fillet dish is really good as well. A lot of students from UofT come here. It seems very popular!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Chinese food I have ever had.  Service was impeccable. Host/owner of the place treated us like honored guests.  I recommend the salt/pepper shrimp.  The noodle/chicken and potato stew (Amazing!!!) and the Chinese broccoli with garlic was delicious!   We are from Los Angeles and have so many options, I have so many things to compare to and have to admit it was fresh and tasty without compromise.  Stop in and enjoy the stylish decor and great food."}
{"text":"Service is really slow and inefficient. The food in general taste good. I like the cauliflower dish, was extra tasty."}
{"text":"Nice place, friendly staff, love the potato with beef most! The price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Dishes in this restaurant are very delicious. Especially lobsters are only 15.99/lb. Highly recommend to have dinner with your friends?"}
{"text":"We were hoping to get higher tier Chinese food (better than the usual Chinatown fare), but left extremely disappointed. 

The restaurant was mostly empty when we came (which is by itself an alarming sign for a Friday lunch). Servers/manager's English was flaky, and they preferred speaking Mandarin.
Decor is nice though.

We had 5 different dishes:
* Fish in oil, Sichuan style -- it was alright, but our Chinese coworkers say Sichuan restaurants cook it better.
* Some kind of medley. I did not get to try it, but it was fine.
* Green Beans with meat: way too salty. 
* Sichuan chicken -- ugh, mostly breading and no chicken. This dish was very bad.
* Some kind of pork -- tasted disgusting. Everybody hated it, and we got it at the end, which ruined the mood, since it was so bad.

Overall prices are noticeably higher than the rest of Chinatown, but the food is the same quality.  

My coworker tried dumplings on another occasion, and swears that they were good."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after a colleague of mine recommended it.

The restaurant was fairly empty at 7:00pm, with an excess amount of serving staff.

My party of 4 decided to order the special meat balls dish, with hot and sour soup, minced pork green beans, fried and boiled dumplings, along with white rice.

Let's start with the food first: soup was insanely spicy, too spicy even for a hot and sour soup. The meatballs were not firm, filled with more rice, and an odd taste (don't recommend ordering it at $16.99 for a tiny dish). The only decent items were the dumplings which were at least flavourful. Our bill came to $75 for everything - which was a rip off!

On to the service, at first things were fine, water was provided, order was taken in a timely manner. Things started getting pretty frustrating when we found ourselves asking 3-4 times for soya sauce, then the bowls of rice we ordered. Maybe 2-3 servers passed us by without acknowledging we needed something. The worse part was their attitudes, didn't properly listen to our requests and just ignored us for the most part.

Now comes time for the bill... the day before they had posted on their Facebook page that they were having a soft opening promotion, 10% off all orders until August 31st. I had mentioned this promotion to the server and she simply responded \"oh... um... we finished that promotion, we are not offering that anymore\" to which I replied \"you guys posted the offer on your Facebook page just yesterday\" now the server looks uneasy, looking around, and then says to me \"oh yeah we decided to end the promotion early\". This is very poor management, especially for a new business. It is definitely a front and not the \"fine chinese cuisine\" that they advertised to be.

I don't recommend eating here, as there are many other better places in Chinatown!

Oh, I've also noticed something pretty alarming, their in house restaurant menu prices do not match the ones listed on their website/delivery menu!"}
{"text":"Really tasty food, nice decor.

We got mo bun, plus summer breeze salad, and original pancake.

Taste is fantastic, service is attentive. Would def come back."}
{"text":"Good and bad here.  The kung pao chicken was pretty good,  a little on the fatty chicken side of life but this restaurant is 'authentic'  Chinese.  Actually too authentic for my taste.  We had the tomato beef and it was scary.  I think there was part of a heart in there.  We actually left almost the whole dish.  Very sad about that.  The hot and sour soup was good.  The chicken dumplings were good too.  The kung pao would have been awesome if they had it with white meat or less fatty... So 50/50 on this place.  Shame as I had high hopes."}
{"text":"98 Aroma is different, and for good reasons. Over time, we're seeing a steady slew of Asian restaurants defining traditional and authentic cuisines being established in Toronto's very own Chinatown. No more do we need to go uptown to experience authentic dishes, and that's where 98 Aroma shines (but with a price).

98 Aroma is situated close to College and Spadina. Their casual exterior does not do justice to the interior design. The interior is decorated nicely with wooden furnishings and a cohesive theme, making you feel like you're eating in a restaurant nested in the heart of Chengdu.

But what makes 98 Aroma shine is the food. It's menu is offered in a normal vs VIP pricing, similar to other new Chinese restaurants in the area. To start, you're offered a completely English-free menu if you speak any form of Chinese. The restaurant has staple Sezchuan dishes such as Fish in Hot Oil, Mapo Tofu, and Double Cooked Pork. Upon our various visits, we sampled a majority of these classical dishes, and found them to be very flavourful. The abundant use of spices and garlic adds to the authenticity of the dishes, and we enjoyed most of them. One problem that we keep on facing is that the dishes are overwhelmingly salty. This was not a consistent problem upon our many visits, but be wary of that when you order.

It is important to note that the prices here are higher than your typical westernized Chinese restaurant prices. Ranging from 15.99 to 18.99 for normal portion sized dishes. However, given by the true flavour and ingredients that they use (such as the fresh seafood), I think it's worth paying the premium for what I believe, is the most defining representation of a real Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing Hunan provincial cuisine, but if you don't bring a Chinese friend, you'll get stuck with the English menu suited to those who like westernized Chinese food..."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Kung Pao Chicken I've had. The mixed vegetable salad is also a refreshing summer dish. Traditional setting and sophisticated interior design. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good. Only thing was the black pepper steak was disappointing."}
{"text":"We had the beef noodles at aroma 98. The portion was enough to share for 2 as you can see on the pictures. Service was quick and very friendly. Unfortunately they forgot our rice bowl but that wasn't too bad - the noodles were enough :) 

The place was clean and had a nice atmosphere. Price value place for sure! Would recommend to anybody! :)"}
{"text":"Don't go. My friend and me both have food poisoning right after eating there...... poor hygiene"}
{"text":"The food was great, price is reasonable with a great portion. Our server is top notch, I think his name was Mark. Definitely will come here again, one of the best restaurant in Toronto in terms of Chinese cuisine in downtown imo."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the presentation is a lot nicer than many traditional Chinese restaurants! It has a nice ambiance without losing its traditional touch (Chinese only menu). Service was not the most attentive. We had to try pretty hard to flag down the waiter to order and at some point just self served water. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant fools you from the outside: the plain storefront hides a phenomenal and authentic Northern Chinese delight. 
My sons and I came here after reading other reviews and weren't disappointed. 
We ordered the signature pancakes -- lightly fried scallion pancakes. I way surprised they didn't come with sauce. The waitress said it wasn't necessary and she was right. 
Kids ordered the 98 Signature Noodle bowls -- one had chicken and one shrimp. Delicious and filling. As one said, he wanted to keep eating after he was full. 
I had the talapia, which was fresh and spicy. The tofu underneath was soaked in chilli sauce and, despite my mouth being on fire, I kept going for more. The waiter took it upon himself to cut my fish when I wasn't apparently eating it right. Still not sure what I did wrong, but that's ok. :)
Other things in our order: shrimp dumplings (too eggy), spring rolls (average) and tsingtao (nailed it).  They play Hits One music, which the kids liked. 
The only downside: the massive portions left us all in food comas. :)"}
{"text":"A cut above most Chinese places on Spadina...very clean, nice decor, welcoming to tourists but still authentic. Great homemade dumplings, beef with cumin, homemade noodles with very good steak. Highly recommend. We were the only non-Asian customers but were treated great by young man and woman working.  Roughly a carafe of ice water to table without us asking which helped with spicy cumin dish. Check them out!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my friend today, and this place is like brand new. The decor is so cute, such a soothing and comfortable place to be in. And my lord, the staff and the service is so beautiful. It makes my heart melt. So friendly honestly though. And not to mention the food is actually so good!!! 8.5/10 DEFFFFRDD."}
{"text":"Food was overcooked. For most of the dishes we ordered. Staff did not like us complaining about the way it was cooked. Reluctant to provide us another meal instead of the overcooked and strange food."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food on Spadina, great atmosphere! Lobster at only $15.99/lb ($19.99 for a whole lobster). Perfect for all occasions!"}
{"text":"In Chinatown, there is a plethora of Asian dining options to choose from. Recently, I had the opportunity to check out the newly opened 98 Aroma where they offer refined Northern Chinese cuisine. The prices are higher than some of the neighboring establishments, so I highly recommend going with a group of 3-5 people to offset the costs. This way, you can order several dishes to share, as most plates are served with generous portion sizes and are meant for sharing. 

The outside may look unassuming, but the interior was designed to replicate traditional Chinese decor with its elaborate wood ornaments, and Asian-inspired craft works. The dimly lit restaurant sets a very relaxing ambiance, and there are several private booths available along with tables.  

The menu consisted of several popular Northern Chinese dishes like dumplings, scallion pancakes, and spicy seafood and beef dishes. Most of Northern Chinese dishes are characterized by its bold flavors, and dishes are served in big portions. So, you can expect both at 98 Aroma. My friend and I started off with the refreshing Summer Breeze Salad ($9.99) - a colorful mixture of sweet-potato noodles, julienne leeks, bell-peppers, red cabbage, radishes, onions, and carrots with a sweet vinaigrette. 

Northern Chinese cuisine is very wheat-based, so I had to order the Pan Fried Pork and Chives Dumplings ($9.99), which was very good. The crispy potstickers were filled with a generous amount of pork, and the chives gave it a nice aroma after being pan fried. 

Next up was their signature dish, the Steamed Tilapia with Chopped Bell Chilies ($29.99) - the dish arrived in a considerable sized bowl with the bone-in tilapia slathered in a rich yet spicy sauce. The fish was juicy and flaky, and the chili-based sauce complemented it beautifully. However, there were just way too many bones, so be extra careful when eating. 

I enjoyed the crispy texture of the Fried Salt and Pepper Calamari ($15.99), and it was perfectly spiced. 

Out of all the dishes, my least favorite was the Signature Chicken Wings ($15.99). Pricewise, it's pretty expensive for wings, and it was lacking in flavor. The peppers were sporadically spread out to the side, so it wasn't spiced very well.

Overall, I had an enjoyable dining experience at 98 Aroma. The restaurant was bustling with customers that Friday evening, and I thought that the wait staff did a good job of handling the customer service. Since they are a new establishment, there were two new waiters on staff training around that time. They were relatively slow, but it's understandable since they're new. 98 Aroma is a welcome addition to the area as they offer a more refined take on Chinese food, and is sure to please the people in the area looking for a nice place to dine."}
