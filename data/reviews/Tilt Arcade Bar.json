{"text":"It is what it is. Cheap and cheerful. It's clean and well taken care of- the people are friendly and helpful, the drinks cheap and simple. The crowd is friendly and easy going. Good value for honest entertainment."}
{"text":"TILT is one of the best bars in Toronto! For only a $5 door fee (2 for 1 Mondays and only $2 on Tuesdays!) You get access to some of the best maintained pinball and video arcade games, plus skee-ball, Hoop Fever, bubble hockey, foosball, Ice Cold Beer, Wacky Gator and so much more all on FREE PLAY! The N64, SNES and NES retro game lounges are a great way to play Mario Kart, Golden Eye or Super Smash Bros. with 3 of your friends. Such a unique place to take a date if you're tired of the whole dinner and a movie thing (which is getting pretty expensive!). And a great destination for out-of-towners who are looking to experience Toronto night life.  TILT has a fantastic selection of 20 craft beers on tap as well as a fully stocked bar. Some classic North American comfort foods such as poutine, corn dogs, cheeseburgers, pulled pork sandwiches, chicken fingers, ice cream sandwiches and funnel cake! Many menu items have vegetarian options as well!  Very friendly and helpful front-of-house staff who are there if you need help with a game. Very lively and fun atmosphere especially after 9pm! Live DJs spinning records on Friday and Saturday nights. At only $5 there is simply no better cost/value for your entertainment dollar in the entire city!  If you're bringing your young ones to play some games please remember it's 19+ after 8pm (best to come on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon when they open at 4PM).   Please note: CASH ONLY at the door, but the bar takes credit, bank cards as well as cash (there is an ATM inside).  Love TILT's new location on Dundas West just a couple blocks west of Bathurst. So much more room to move around and sit and chill out.   LONG LIVE THE ARCADE!!"}
{"text":"How can anyone not love this place??? $5 cover fee to get in and then you can play all games unlimited. If I lived in Toronto I would easily spend hours here with friends on a chill night.   They have little booths here too where you can play different game stations (N64, Sega, Super Nintendo). Just be aware that it can be a bit of wait depending on what you're trying to play. We went on a Sunday night and even then it was still pretty busy."}
{"text":"Very fun spot for friends to hang out at night. Only $5 for cover. All games are free. Foosball, wacky gator, Pacman and many more!"}
{"text":"It's cool here if you are a games fanatic, but it is busy! Good luck getting a spot on a Saturday night!  It's a great place for a date or to hang out with a few friends, but hard to fit a large group. Entry is super cheap ($5), the line outside moves pretty quickly, and this location is slightly larger/more open than the old Bloor St. location. I don't think I have ever had a drink here so I can't speak to the drinks, but by looking at the full bar, I would assume they are a standard price and made well.  Game on, peeps!"}
{"text":"A popular and 'happening' spot away from the hustle and bustle of Toronto. Location is ideal as this area can get quiet after a certain time, hence the TILT brings this neighborhood to life after the sun sets. *****IMPORTANT, do come early as the line-ups can be insane and there's no guarantee you'll be able to make it in. Tilt is a venue that features classic arcade and pin ball machines that are FREE. The only thing you really pay for is a $5 cover, optional $2 coat check and whatever food and drinks you want to order.  I did however find their popcorn really salty. For you beer fans, they've got a pretty good selection.  As for ambiance, this place is busy and fun especially when reminiscing the old video game/ arcade game-days. It definitely screams nostalgia all over again....especially seeing the rod hockey table!!!!    For those looking to chill out, there are high tables and chairs located throughout the venue for those to take a break from all the gaming. ....I'll be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Stumbled into Tilt Arcade Bar the other night and I truly had such a blast at their new location.   Pretty decent selection of games from the old era of coin crunchin' video gaming, with enough drinks and snacks to boot. Best of all the games are free and the environment is pretty friendly considering it's a gaming free for all.   What better way to get out some post-work aggression by bopin' crocodiles on the head or saving Aerosmith from the New World Order?   Prices are fair considering that the video games are free - when we went it wasn't too crowded, but I can imagine on a weekend it being a bit of chaos.   Would love to see the establishment open early so that families could enjoy playing some of these classic video games, such potential to be more of a family oriented place during the day before the mad rush of hipsters crash the joint. I can also see things being problematic with customers not wanting to get off machines, or the wait time being too long to play certain games. I know the establishment promotes a sharing is caring vibe, but perhaps they need to promote the culture a little further with a \"one and done\" turn... or perhaps, one life then offer the game up to anyone lingering before dropping an extra life.   So close to giving this guy a 5 star review, I'll have to revisit to give it a fair second chance - I guess I'm looking for my socks to be blown off with something different, although my feet tapping the whole time.   Regardless, this business is worth our patronage and in turn they will deliver some great times and quarters saved."}
{"text":"Sunday night fun!     This was one of the better experiences of Toronto I've personally had when the boys and I spent the weekend downtown. We were staying for 2 nights(Saturday, Sunday) and ended up here on Sunday as we were having a hard time finding places to go out at night and we ended up settling on this place.   To our surprise it was bumping and there were a good amount of people. It's 5 dollars to get in and all the machines are free to play! AMAZING!!  It didn't seem like any of the machines I played were broken as well! Such a plus! They offer a wide variety of liquor and food as well.   I totally recommend coming here on any off day/night.   Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Great place for some retro arcade games, beers, and snacks!   A group of us went on Tuesday after dinner, around 8-10pm. There is $2 on Tuesdays, and it was quite busy the whole night. They have a great variety of arcade games, from pinball to pacman, skeeball and basketball, and even a couch with some controllers. The games are all free, with unlimited play, and there is a counter where you can order pop, craft beers, and snacks. It's dark and gets quite loud, but it's a great place to hang out and have some fun."}
{"text":"Review is reflective of the abhorrent customer experience I received from, supposedly, a manager (short guy with dark curly hair and a full beard). Let me just say that a simple \"I'm sorry\" goes a long way. Instead this man went out of his way to put me down for a mistake made by the kitchen. I didn't realize that informing an employee that the kitchen messed up an order was \"wasting his time\".  It's unfortunate that people in managerial roles have no idea how to respectfully deal with customer complaints.  Also, music is as loud as I would want it at at club, but not somewhere where I'd like to be able socialize without yelling, and I am not a \"soft\" speaker."}
{"text":"$5 to play as long as you want on a wide variety of arcade games and pinball machines. They also have some video game consoles for small groups.  Air hockey, skee ball, basketball hoop also available for the competitive-minded.   For five dollars, this is a great way to while away an hour or three!"}
{"text":"I have been to the old Tilt location in the past and loved the whole all you can play concept. The new location does not disappoint. $5 cover and $2 coat check, you are then able to enjoy unlimited games! My personal favorites from last night's visit was the sit-down racing game, the basketball machine and the Cold Beer tilting game. Overall, this location is bigger and offers a bit more seating. In addition, the food (fries, burgers, funnel cake) and drinks here are also affordable so if you are hungry, don't be worried. I will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Discovered this amazing place when I was invited by a friend of mine. If you pay $5 to enter this bar, you have unlimited plays of the arcade, pinball, and console games they have available. There are so many games! If you go on Tuesdays, cover is only $2.   Couldn't recommend this place more! A perfect place to spend an afternoon reminiscing and playing retro games from your childhood. The hours flew by when I went here! They also have a decent selection of craft beers and assorted snacks, including corn dogs.  Must go here!"}
{"text":"Such a great spot if you're ready to surround yourself with a little nostalgia. There is a cover to get in--no more than $5, and they do cheap Toonie Tuesday every week--but once you're in you get unlimited play on all the games! They've got NES and N64 consoles, tabletop arcade games and pinball machines everywhere, plus skee ball. All the games are in great condition and I've never noticed any broken ones. There are some tables, but it's not really the place to go if you're looking to sit and chat. You'll be too distracted by all the games to want to sit anyways."}
{"text":"Love love love!! $5 cover that gets you in to play any classic arcade games you want. The new location is comfortably more spacious than the old one. Excellent location as well.  Only thing to note is that Only serve draft beers and some snacks. But there are great restaurants close by where you can dine before you dive into the games.   Guarantee you'll love this place especially if you love arcade games."}
