{"text":"Enjoyed variety of exotic flavors...but it could use some normal flavors too. Pricing for froyo pretty good compared to local competition."}
{"text":"Gotta love a place with dairy-free options!  It costs the same as a Zoyo place, so it isn't cheap, but I like the fact I can take my daughter and I can get something too."}
{"text":"Well I have been in here about five times now, and nothing has changed. the yogurt ehh ok... I like how cold it is and doesnt melt fast! Other than that they dont have much going for them. We have had terrible customer service everytime. Today just went in and the lady at the register just stared at me didnt say a word. They dont even say hi when your walking in you pretty much have to figure it out on your own. The tables have always been dirty! Its a nice big open store but the worst part was there is one person at the register and thats it... The topping counter was DISGUSTING! toppings everywhere in other toppings there was a pile of kiwi on the counter, reeses in the strawberries, which were not even full. not impressed it grossed me out that they cant hire one more employee to clean the place up when needed. Ive tried given them many chances but i think im done!"}
{"text":"This is our family go to for a great frozen yogurt!  They have a variety of delicious toppings to go with their yogurt.  You are always greeted with a smile when you walk in.  I highly recommend checking this spot out!"}
{"text":"We love going to Yoasis and trying out the new froyo flavors, and we always make sure to bring our out-of-town guests there. I can't remember it ever NOT being clean and well maintained, and I'm kind of a neat freak. The bathrooms are well maintained also. They also sell dog-friendly frozen treats as well as gelato, plus (non-alcoholic) drinks like soda, bottled water, and iced coffee. The prices are reasonable, a good value for what you're getting, especially when you use your punch card and receive free yogurt after every so many bought; They offer BOGO on the already-packed yogurt, which is a nice bargain. There are coloring pages and crayons and a couple of toddler things/a funny mirror for the really little ones who gobble up their treat and want to toddle around while their family finishes up.  The only less-than-perfect things I can say about Yoasis are: 1. The customer service could be better (it's usually teenagers who don't greet you--but they are usually busy), and 2. The toppings (of which there is quite a variety) seem to always be the same ones every time. It'd be cool if they had a new topping every so often and highlighted that somehow, just to keep things interesting! (IDEA: how about a special \"holiday\" topping--and flavor--each month/season? Gimmicky but fun!)   Offering coupons would be nice, too, but again the punch card is very helpful for families on a budget. It also must be said that Yoasis is locally owned and they support MANY area organizations by coming to events and giving back portions of their event sales. I hope Yoasis is around for many years to come!"}
{"text":"Our family has been to Yoasis Ahwatukee several times, each time they have not disappointed us! There are 12 yummy flavors of all tastes and indulgences.  If that wasn't enough, there are over 50 toppings you can add to the delicious flavors! Candies, fruits, sauces and the wonderful cheesecake bites!  Wow!  The staff has always been friendly.  Not as helpful, but then, it is self-serve.  They do a good job of keeping the place tidy with as many kids and child-like parents, myself included, that frequent their establishment.  I our visits have been better than some of the other reviewers.  Hopefully those reviews were read and changes made by Yoasis.   We look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"The yogurt is very good and comes in lots of flavors. However it's a little pricey. If I want lots of good toppings I have to pay a lot of money. Usually I try to stick to 3 or less toppings and it's still like $5-$7. I think it's too expensive to pay a little less than $10 for yogurt when I could go across the street and get better tasting ice cream from Water and Ice."}
{"text":"Love this Yogurt place!  Delicious yogurt and more toppings then I have ever seen.  You serve yourself so the tendency is to take to much....but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Might be a little more pricey, but you're paying for a mom and pop that pays much more attention to what its customers want than any franchise, and is hugely generous to the Ahwatukee, not to mention that they have amazing quality!"}
{"text":"There isn't much to say, it's just a self-serve frozen yogurt place. But it is a very good one. It has a wide selection of toppings and flavors and everything is delicious. It is pretty cheap but slightly pricey at the same time. If your around, give it a try, and I'd doubt you'd be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 2 stars because I find their topping selection to be decent. This place does not have good customer service. The kid that works up front needs a crash course on how to deal with customers, or the owner needs to hire older more experienced people.   Last night I went up to the cashier (where he was working) and accidentally spilt some of the toppings that were on my Froyo. Instead of telling me he'd take care of it, him and the other girl who were working up front watched as me and the people I was with cleaned it up ourselves. My brother literally had to drag the trash can himself so we could clean it, and all the employees did was watch us! What kind of place let's their customers clean up a mess? It was ridiculous. To top it all of they have no manners. They don't reply to thank you's, don't even greet you, don't even offer thank you's! never coming here again."}
{"text":"I love lots of options and Yoasis has lots of options! 12 yogurts, endless fresh toppings, sauces like Nutella, Godiva chocolate and many more. I wish they had this place when I was a kid. I would have lost my marbles over it! My husband loves the \"recipes\" for yogurt mixes and toppings that they provide. They even have doggie frozen treats that my dogs go crazy over. I love that it's a mom and pop place! I wish there were more establishments like it."}
{"text":"Our family LOVES Yoasis! The environment and staff are always friendly and love that they have a few tvs, table games, coloring pages for the younger kids, and outside sitting. The frozen yogurt and toppings always taste great and they do an awesome job mixing up some of the flavors. Just bought a puppy and can't wait to take him to try out the dog frozen yogurt too!"}
{"text":"This is a really good place to hang out and get frozen yogurt. They have a nice variety of frozen yogurt flavors available, and a ton of toppings available to add.  My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are kind of expensive as they charge by weight, so it is easy to rack up a $5 yogurt if you're not careful."}
{"text":"Great family owned place, nice place to go as a family.  Great flavor choices and lots of toppings.  Will happily keep returning."}
{"text":"Sweet place. Good yogurt, good mix ins. I like how involved they are in the community  - they have a community bulletin board you should check out, and last time they had some crazy fundraiser."}
{"text":"They are the only place the uses Stevia which is great. They have good flavor options but the toppings selection is subpar compared to others. Too many cereal choices and the dispenser releases too much. They owner/manager is very friendly"}
{"text":"I looooooove this place!!! It has the most unique flavors and the best toppings. Love the   \"Boba\"."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Always friendly staff & the location is always kept clean :) Lucky to have this in the foothills of ahwatukee."}
{"text":"They get better and better. So many options and non dairy options too! Bringing my family often this summer."}
{"text":"It's pretty good yogurt, I went with some of my friends who are locals (which I'm not) and we had a blast! I got a dole whip on one side with strawberry boba and a chocolate with strawberry's on the other. It wasn't the best yogurt ever but it's pretty good if you just in the mood for a (cheaper) frozen treat."}
{"text":"Great yogurt at a great price! The workers were friendly and I had some of the greatest, creamiest, and sweetest yogurt of my life here. What a life changing experience"}
{"text":"Great local spot for yogurt! Staff is so nice, yogurt is great with loads of fun toppings. They even have yogurt for dogs!!! Our hot dog Zina can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great little yogurt/treat shop. I like that they have more than just yogurt and the folks that own it are very nice. It's always clean and not too crowded."}
{"text":"Its good, sometimes the topping options are stale/old. Pistachio is the best flavor but comes and goes. The kids working don't know most of the products as well. But its down the street and easy to go to!"}
{"text":"So many options and fresh toppings bar!! Great price and glad to have found this nearby treasure!!"}
{"text":"Decent frozen yogurt here. Nothing really special and prices are a bit high. If you're in the Foothills and are looking for a fix, it's worth stopping by, but it's not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan. I have been in twice and I love the sampling. I'm full before I leave (just kidding) Peanut butter is my favorite. I don't taste tangy yogurt  at all (another review says something about that) All I taste  yummy creamy goodness.    The counter person should really do more then be a counter person when it isn't busy. I agree they sit...and watch your every move. They should move around and clean up tables, tidy the topping station and interact with the customer, tell us what combos are best. (cause we know you are sampling it also)  Price...39 cents an ounce. $6.24 a pound. A small container comes to about $3 if your easy on the toppings and $11 for the big one. Get a punch card, buy 9 get 1 free.  Nice addition to the foothills. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Yoasis is set up like other self serve yogurt places but it also has a meeting room as well as patio seating. The parking is excellent and the place is spotless.  They have a punch card for frequent patrons and I will admit that I am on my third punch card. After nine purchases your 10th one is free.  Every flavor I have had has been excellent. The topping selection is always clean and well organized.  This is a very popular spot for kids Fridays after school. It is also very popular for families on the weekends.  Well air conditioned indoor seating is also very nice and it is very accessible for handicapped needs."}
{"text":"Pretty good little place, and it's close to home! My 8 year old said it's wayyy better than 31 flavors. Hah so whatever that's worth to you. Good selection of toppings, seemed fair on cost"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic !! Many many toppings.  Oahu oatmeal yogurt rocks Would recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The Hawaiian Dole Whip Pineapple is my favorite with the Pomegranate."}
{"text":"I guess I am unlike the other reviewers in that I LOVE the tart and now unfortunately they don't have it anymore. Sniffle sniffle. I will now have to go to Zoyo which is further away."}
{"text":"Love this place! great selection of frozen yogurt, amazing selections for toppings, great service, extremely clean!"}
{"text":"Great flavor and options! A little pricey but awesome for the summer :) Glad to have froyo down in this area."}
{"text":"Tasty frozen yogurt with extensive topping choices.  All of the yogurt is clearly marked as to its status - non dairy, fat free, low fat, sugar free, etc.  In a great location as there isn't much else this far out in Ahwatukee..."}
{"text":"Nice new fro yo place. Bland decor but tons of flavors and toppings. I would have given 4 stars, but the tart flavor was disappointing.  Edit: Went there for try number 2, the to-go lids they had for my size cup didn't fit. The kid at the counter offered me tape..."}
{"text":"A locally owned yogurt shop, with friendly staff and a wide range of flavors and toppings! I especially like the sour apple + dulce de leche twist that makes it taste like a caramel apple! They always seem to have a lot of fresh fruit toppings, and they have TOASTED coconut in addition to regular coconut! (Never seen that at any other yogurt store before)  The price per oz is more than the average yogurt store, but its variety and proximity to my house keeps me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Yoasis has exceptional frozen yogurt flavors and fresh toppings. Friendly management and staff. Unique flavors. They also have very good gelato that comes with a little wafer that is tasty. They have a good frequent buyer program."}
{"text":"flavors suck, managment sucks, there were kids eating like pigs, never again will i go there"}
{"text":"They have pretty good frozen yogurt. It's creamy and the flavors are strong. The shop has a good selection of regular, no sugar added, and sorbets. Also, they have gelato, cones, and ice cream sandwiches. The toppings bar is standard for most frozen yogurt places. Inside it's fairly clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH HOW MANY TOPPINGS CAN THERE POSSIBLY BE??? This place was bomb. I can't believe they even had rock candy (not the lame gummy kind but the cool chocolate pieces). The raspberry pomegranate sorbet was super yummy and mixed well with cake batter. I highly recommend this place for anyone nearby looking for something to help them cool off from the heat. Super cool and standard prices, so all this extra variety and toppings for no extra cost.  Also, GENIUS IDEA, the froyo separators that fit in the bowl to keep two sides.separate just in case you can't decide between two flavors and don't want to mix everything."}
{"text":"Nice place with a friendly staff and great yogurt choices and a huge selection of toppings"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!  I can say that as many times that I have visited, I have never had a bad experience.    There is always an amazing variety of flavors and toppings.  In fact more toppings than what I have seen at other local Fro Yo locations in the area.  New flavors are introduced weekly and there are always \"stand-by\" flavors available.  Additionally there are \"dairy-free\" options.  They have a loyalty stamp card, often have coupons, and utilize social media for specials.    I always feel welcomed when I walk in and I am able to sample flavors with sampling cups anytime.    I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Our family loves Yoasis.  It is small businesses like these that really add value to living in Ahwatukee.  This is a family owned operation that gives excellent service without fail.  They treat our children well, and have plenty of games available for family time inside the store.  Our daughter has participated in the chess club at Yoasis and we appreciate having the space available.  The yogurt is delicious and the toppings bar is always fresh.  The restaurant is very clean.  Five stars."}
{"text":"Great local family run froyo place, akways clean with good options and good flavors. Their simple yet good options for younger kids birthday party is spot on and very friendly. The TVs are only distraction for this place, it's often quite loud and on crummy shows. Good neighborhood staple."}
{"text":"Yoasis is a great Mom and Pop froyo shop, and it's just what this part of \"booniesville\" Ahwatukee needed.   There aren't too many of them in this area, either, so it's nice not to have to support one of the giant chains nearby that aren't that great (Orange Leaf, Zoyo, etc.).   This is where I got my froyo fix while living here four years ago. Now I only drop by if I'm house/dog sitting for my family ... Or had if I had some dental work done across the street like last night!   The flavors are always rich, creamy and delicious. Multiple non dairy, sugar free and non fat options for everyone. Not sure about gluten free, though.  The names are cute too: Cabo Cake Batter, Matzatlan Milk Chocolate, Manele Bay Mint, Riviera Red Velvet, etc. I love when they bring back pumpkin spice around Halloween!  A while back we asked one of the employees if they make their product in house (like my favorite place in Tempe, Aloha Yogurt).   Turns out, it's mixes from cartons. Bummer, dudes.   The place is consistently clean. I just wish there was a little more variety of Boba, fruit, etc. on the toppings bar since there's so much candy, syrups, cookies, cakes, cereals, etc.   Most recently I got their Non Dairy Pineapple with a splash of Pomegranate Sorbet and some fruit toppings. Crackhead combo? Yes. Tasty? Definitely!  Dude got a standby, Mint and Chocolate swirled.  Yoasis now also offers Gelato (haven't tried) and Yoghund yogurts for your fur children. My dog, Halo, absolutely flips for these treats!  Little more pricey than other shops in the area at .43 per ounce. Don't forget to get a punch card!   Give Yoasis a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Right around the corner and I even have stuff for your dog it's a quaint quiet little place with beautiful views of the foothills and lots of toppings to choose from yummy"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved back to Ahwatukee and tried ALL the frozen yogurt places in the area!  Yoasis is by far and away the BEST and Cleanest location!  There are a TON of toppings there and the staff is great!"}
{"text":"They are the best yougart place I have ever been to and very friendly and a great place to take your family and just up the street from were I live"}
{"text":"Great place to have in our neighborhood! Kids love it! This area needed some place like this- my daughter loves all the flavors and toppings they also have gelato which I love!"}
{"text":"Went in to try frozen yogurt for the first time and at first I had no idea what to get. Aoife walked me through it and let me tell you.... This place has grade A frozen yogurt! The topping selection was mind blowing, I did not even know there was that many things that could be turned into a topping!!  I am always happy to help a family owned business!"}
{"text":"Best frozen yogurt in town. So many toppings and flavor options. Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"All these yogurt shops are about the same to me.  I can't really see much of a difference from one to the other.    The thing I liked about this location?  It had TWO dairy-free options.  This is huge.  For some reason my daughter goes insane when she eats dairy and we have experienced two meltdowns after taking her to yogurt shops.  We would never have purchased her frozen yogurt again if we hadn't found a dairy-free option.  The one thing I did not like was that the yogurt did not seem to be as cold out of the machine as it is in other shops.  It was a bit drippy.  This was across the board for the six flavors we tried collectively.  The price was 42 cents an ounce, which was a little higher than the other shops we have been to (39 cents seems to be the norm in this part of town).    Overall, it was a decent shop and I have no major complaints."}
{"text":"Picked this place by chance and I'm so very glad I did. It's a family owen froyo shop, they love what they do and it shows. They offer delicious flavors with non dairy and sugar free options, they've got tons of toppings and sauces!! They have other delicious treats available like gelato, Italian ice, and root beer floats."}
