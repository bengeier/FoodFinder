{"text":"This place was pretty cute! The woman behind the counter was super helpful, giving us tons of info without too much prying which I super appreciated. We ended up choosing the iced tea that was steeped over night, which was caffeine free and unsweetened. I loved that it comes unsweetened so you can add sweetener if you want (it did not need) versus the iced tea at Roselle which came presweetened and was way too sweet. Then the best part - the straw ! The cutest pineapple paper straw I ever saw. So cool to use eco friendly straws."}
{"text":"Fantastic new cafe and bar on King East. Great coffee, pastries and light breakfast and lunch options. At night it becomes a bar. Terrific, warm interior and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very nice interior, great iced Latte and a wonderful fluffy quiche. The salad comes with house made dressing - delicious! Also just the right music selection. We were there during daytime but will definitely come back for a drink at the bar in the evening."}
