{"text":"Accueil très agréable, les assiettes sont copieuses. L'ambiance est agréable et parfaite pour un repas décontracté de fin de semaine. Nous avons bien apprécié le lapin braisé et le porc Nagano, accompagnés de légumes tendrement cuits"}
{"text":"Simply delightful from start to finish, this little bistro in the heart of the Latin Quarter cannot be missed.  The ambiance, friendly staff (the brother-owners are amazing), the food, everything, La Demande Generale pays attention to reach detail with painstaking care to ensure every guest feels like they are welcomed family. Thank you for an amazing experience. Highly recommended to everyone living in or visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal at this place with excellent service. Owned and operated by a trio of brothers who take pride and care in their business. It's worth a stop to have a great meal."}
{"text":"This a gem of a restaurant.  I was visiting Montreal for a few days for work and was looking for a solid dinner, nice ambiance, and a place to unwind late.  Came here around 10:20pm (they stop serving food at 11pm) and the food, service and everything in general just blew me away.  I am also highly picky about my food (having lived in NYC, LA and now the SF Bay Area), I am also Celiac/allergic to gluten and am generally on a Paleo/Whole 30 diet.  They were able to not only accommodate my dietary restrictions but the food just tasted incredible.  Most of the items were locally sourced and everything was fresh.  They adapted some of the dishes so they wouldn't have gluten or dairy, and the staff went out of their way to make sure things were ok.  I actually came back the second night, the next day, since I had such a great experience.  The place is owned and operated by 3 brothers, who are just the nicest guys in the world.  The place just opened last October and I hope they have a long and prosperous run as I hope to be back in Montreal next summer and to come by again!"}
{"text":"Nothing short of amazing. Coming from NYC, where I am spoiled with food, Le General comes with a refreshing perspective to cuisine. The staff is very personable and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Came to La Demande Generale, service was unbelievable, they had a pretzel bun hamburger that was the best thing I have had in Montreal. I highly recommend coming here for dinner and a drink. It is top notch food and top notch service"}
{"text":"This was our first night in Montreal, and the delicious food at La Demande Generale was spot on! Our family of four (including two demanding teenagers) enjoyed everything we ordered.  Entrees (Appetizers): (1.) Salade Romaine Grillee -- Whole grilled romaine lettuce with bite-sized bacon and croutons; the grilled romaine definitely added a nice taste to this salad. (2.) Calmars Grilles -- Grilled calamari on a bed of couscous with the slightest hint of lime  Plats Principaux (Main): (1.) Bavette de Boeuf -- Flank steak; the sauce was heavenly! (2.) Poutine a la Joue de Boeuf -- A staple of Quebec; our waitress recommended this dish, and I have to agree with her that it is decadent.  (3.) Prise du Jour (Fish of the Day) -- Red snapper; oh, so tender! Served with hummus and a Greek salad. (4.) Pizza - Sauce Alfredo, Poireaux, Ail, Champignons, Chorizo  Dessert: (1.) Beignet - I.D.G. -- Wow! The caramel sauce was magnificent! Semi-covered chocolate cherries were pluses!  The mark of a great meal is when all the plates are completely cleaned. All of our plates can be described that way. We still want to go back and try the burger.  Last but not least, our waitress Asma deserves a shout-out. She was friendly, informative, and hospitable.   If you are ever in Montreal, La Demande Generale is one bistro that can't be missed!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant on a Friday night, and what a happy accident! The food was delicious and the service was FANTASTIC. Great atmosphere too! Absolutely loved it!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a long time user of yelp but this is my first review. I have been to many restaurants that I would give 5 stars but the reason I am writing this review is because not only was the food superb but the service was excellent. The atmosphere was cozy and friendly. There is something to appeal to everyone on the menu, from wood brick oven pizza to duck confit. The portion sizes were very generous and the preparation and presentation, spot on. With so many places to go in Montreal, we were pleased that our first night here we hit a gem!"}
{"text":"Wow- amazing in all aspects! My favorite dining experience in our Quebec travels. Owned by 3 brothers and open since fall 2016, located on the busy Rue St-Denis it can be easy to miss but don't pass by. Service was friendly and detailed in English to help decipher the French menu. Cream of carrot soup and beer salad started us off perfectly with tender delicious beets in a beautiful presentation. My soup was creamy and so flavorful, wished I'd ordered 2, so good! Main courses of calamari over perfectly cooked and seasoned grains and my flank steak was served on a piece of slate with a large helping of creamy mashed sweet potatoes and al dente vegetables with the medium rare steak tender and flavorful with a rich au jus if desired.  Reasonably priced Italian wine topped it off.  Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. Amazing service. Got the best poutine in my life. Family own. Good vibes. Totally recommend !"}
{"text":"Visiting from the US and found this restaurant on yelp. It was so good, we came back twice during our Montreal stay! Family owned, the service is excellent, food even better. Add it to your list of places to eat!"}
{"text":"3 étoiles, c'est déjà bien. Personne ne pourra contredire le fait que le personnel est aux petits soins dans cet établissement ouvert depuis septembre (tous les avis l'attestent). Mais pour une cuisine qui se prétend fraiche et du marché avec une carte réduite et souvent mise à jour, nous sommes restés sur notre faim (d'où l'étoile en moins)... c'était bien, mais sans plus. Burger Bretzel pour moi et poutine joue de boeuf pour madame. Nous avions prévu de manger sans trop trainer avant d'aller au mercredi 100% humour et c'était le bon choix, les prix sont raisonnables."}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about this place.  I got lucky, on the walk home from work one night, I was walking down St. Denis and the menu caught my eye out of sheer simplicity.  A restaurant having a succinct list is always a good sign, it usually means they pick a few things and do them well.  Letty, one of the guys who works there started chatting with me and made me feel welcome right away.  Later I found out he was one of the owners.  I really felt like an amazing salad with protein on it and a good glass of wine or two.  I started a new job that sent me up to Montreal for training for 6 weeks, so I was new to the area, it was my first day and I needed a good meal and a drink.    What came out what probably one of the best salads I have ever had.  The chef perfectly grilled a nice big piece of salmon, over a bed of arugula and some grilled veggies underneath, he made an amazing vinaigrette and I had a glass of a light Tuscan Sangiovese from Maremma.  I chatted with them about the list a bit, they do have cool eclectic list going on there.  I enjoyed my salad, had a few glasses of wine and the also asked them to pack my lunch for me for the following day so I could have another killer salad.  Again, that they did, a great piece of grilled chicken, a big salad, some roasted veggies, a little pureed squash and a new vinaigrette.  I was sold!  I have been back every week and the food just continues to blow me away.  But, its not just the food.  Montreal is filled with amazing food, this city rocks my world with the food.  With Le Demand General it's a combination of a lot of things with this place, Letty and the crew always make you feel like you're part of the family when you walk in.  It's like a real life Cheers, but with great food, and a great bar.  The bartender/ sommelier really knows his stuff and is pretty fun to chat with.  The place is super cool, you have a mix of having a nice restaurant area to eat in as well as a bar to hang out, drink and chill with friends at.    One of my friends came up and visited on a weekend and we went their which was an absolute blast.  We ordered some appetizers and main courses to share and branded out a lot into their ever growing wine list.  They had a wild mushroom risotto that I need more of in my life, for sure.  We also had a beef cheek what was so rich, sharing it was more than enough.  Every bite was memorable.  I know there are so many great places to go, but, Le Demande General is not a place to be missed.  They don't have anything frozen and the don't cut any corners, so everything you have is fresh and great quality.  I do wish they would do some more marketing!  When I tell my co-workers about it, not many people have heard of it, but other than that, I wouldn't change anything."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely dinner at this comfortable little gem. They offer a variety of options. I had the vegetable curry and my guest had the short rib. Both were delicious. Waiter was knowledgeable and fun to talk with."}
{"text":"Bof je ne peux pas dire que j'ai trippé sur mon expérience a la demande generale ! La place était correcte et la bouffe était correcte elle aussi mais sans plus !   Je ne vais pas y retourner."}
{"text":"Early in the evening (around 7pm) on a weekday it was easy to get a table of 4. The interior was clean, stylish, and calm. People in my group got the bavette de boeuf, short rib, and confit du canard. They all seemed to enjoy them! The waiter was friendly and very helpful with explaining the menu to us."}
{"text":"J'ai été dans ce restaurant juste à côté du métro Sherbrooke avec une collègue du travail. C'était une excellente idée; la place n'étant pas trop bruyante, cela nous a permis de parler lors de ce 5@7 improvisé. Belle place, chaleureuse. Ils étaient prêts à adapter certains trucs sur le menu pour en faire un repas végé. Le risotto que j'ai commandé était riche et onctueux, vin exquis. Le propriétaire s'est plié en quatre pour qu'on passe une belle soirée; à refaire!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner tonight to meet up with some friends from out of town. Totally just skimmed through Yelp for a decent place that was midway between their hotel and my place and La Demande Générale fit the bill.   I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! We ate out on the terrace at sunset, had delicious pizzas, and shared some beignets for dessert. The service was impeccable- very friendly and kind, attentive, and all around enjoyable!  Will definitely be back to this restaurant in the future!"}
{"text":"Une bonne cuisine, moderne et accessible, prix raisonnables, produits frais et cadre confortable. Je recommande."}
{"text":"If I could I would leave this place 0 stars. The food is horrible. It seems that they don't know how to cook. The waiter did not offer the menu. Only after 2 nd attempt he brought the menu. He did not want to make any suggestions on the food. There is an older guy who constantly was on the phone while cooking the food. He touches his phone, cooking, slicing stuff at the same time. Very unsanitary. Ordered 2 items and they were absolutely uneatable. The dishes came in half cold like they were cooked before. It was clear that they just briefly warmed them up. Had duck which was cold. It came with some crazy salad combination, unfresh strawberries, blueberries and greens and some strange chunks of merengues. Underneath the duck leg there was absolutely cold puree which tasted quite awful. I went to many high end restaurants but have never seen duck with sweet merengues as a dish. I am all for contrasts, experiments but trust me that would make anyone to throw up. I could not eat that \"piece of art\" and just was left very hungry. Another dish was the steak.  It was a bad chunk of meat absolutely cold with vinegar flavor plus just unfresh looking vegetables. Contacted the restaurant about the negative experience and the owner was extremely rude by stating that I did not understand their food. He did not apologize and argued in a very hostile manner. It seems that the reviews are bogus because this type of food is not anything close to Montreal restaurants and we all know that Montreal has plenty of delicious restaurants. Avoid this establishment at all costs if you don't want find yourself hungry, angry and dissatisfied. Personally had to go to a local supermarket to find some food to eat after this bizarre experience."}
{"text":"So good! The man helping us translated the menu for us, helped us avoid certain foods I was allergic to, and made wonderful recommendations. The food was delicious, fast, and our water glasses were always full. Highly recommend the Grand Charps drink! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner while I was in montreal based on the reviews. Food was good, but the wait for almost everything was absolutely ridiculous. After being seated immediately, we were not given a dinner menu until about 15 minutes. We did get our drinks within 5 minutes. Another 10 minutes to order when there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant. We started with the salmon tartare and smoked salmon, both very good! While the apps came out timely, we waited another 15 minutes for our entrees. My duck confit was served to me looking like it had been chewed up and thrown on the plate. (The table next to us had ordered the same thing and it looked much nicer) While the flavors were good, it was dry and hard to eat. The strawberry salad served with it was delicious, however. Ended up staying here for about 2 hours because we were waiting so long for everything. I will say all the servers were very sweet. If the restaurant had been full I would have understood such a long wait time and slower service, but since we were one of the three tables in the restaurant I was confused. Maybe we just went on an off night. I don't mind waiting for food at all, but this was just too much."}
{"text":"Loved this amazing restaurant!!! Everyone should go if they have a chance! I rarely write reviews but La Demande Generale was so good that it compelled me to write one. Visiting from NYC, my husband and I were looking for a place to have our first dinner in Montreal; impressed by the great reviews, we decided to make a reservation and they did not disappointment! We tried the tasting menu and every single dish was fantastic! (Some favorites included the salmon tartare, duck confit and short ribs). The service was also excellent and we had a lovely evening; we would have been so sad if we didn't get to experience La Demande Generale during our stay. I highly highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We stopped at this restaurant for an early dinner in August while on vacation and the food was incredible.  So incredible, in fact, that when we happened to be passing by around lunch time the next day, we popped in again!  And ordered just about the exact same meal...  but don't judge!  Sometimes I tend to get a little obsessed with specific dishes and when you've already enjoyed something once, why not get more of a good thing?    When we were just finishing up, it began to absolutely POUR outside, so we decided to sit at the bar to wait it out with a drink.  We ended up chatting with two of the three brothers for a bit and you can tell they are passionate about what they do.    Try the romaine (caesar?) salad (it's grilled!) and the pizza.  We had the proscuitto and arugula one, but they all looked good.    Don't miss this place for the great food, ambience, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Seriously great food, service and atmosphere. My wife and I had the pork chops, duck confit and beet salad, and licked each plate clean! They could try for a Michelin star! Highly recommended. Also, if you eat and drink too much, a nice park isn't too far to walk it off. Why am I kidding, you could sleep it off!"}
{"text":"The ambiance here is so cozy and laid-back. The sound levels are well-managed so you can have a nice conversation. The seating is very comfortable. This place is great for a chill evening out with your flame or an unhurried friend soirée.  They have many delicious offerings and lots of comfort food. We tried one of their pizzas and the risotto (excellent texture) and enjoyed both. We don't often order dessert, but the surprise highlight of the evening was their house donut which was tasty and beautifully presented.  The servers are friendly and very attentive without being overwhelming. I live in the neighbourhood, and I'll definitely be back. I'm looking forward to when they have brunch. I bet it will be fab :)"}
{"text":"We had a very nice meal at La Demande Generale. The service was super friendly and they did their best to accommodate special requests. We had short ribs, duck confit, poutine, and pizzas with grilled calamari for appetizers and beignets for dessert. Everyone loved their meal and raved when they tasted the others. If everyone in our family of picky eaters loves their meal, it's a day to mark on the calendar.  The poutine was a twist on the traditional - a cheese sauce over veal cheeks and mushrooms.  The short ribs were perfectly braised and luxurious.  This was our best meal in Montreal. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Exceptional food, drink and service. The beet salad, grilled romaine salad, wood fired pizzas, short ribs were all exceptional. Owned and operated by 3 brothers who clearly put their heart and soul into this quaint, classy restaurant that treats guests like old friends. Our party of 4 consisting of my wife and 2 daughters were provided premium service at every turn. A culinary highlight of our vacation from Orlando, FL.  Lastly- try the beignets- fantastic."}
{"text":"This was one of the greatest eating experiences I have ever had abroad. So much so, we went back the next night. The owners are incredible. It is a fantastic vibe. Personable and friendly and really making you feel like you matter. The food is incredible. So fresh and well prepared. If you come to Montreal, you HAVE to make this amazing place a stop on your agenda. (Probably more than once :) ) My father thanks you for the extra onions! Thanks Laki!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews here, but this place really deserves one. I haven't experienced such a good service in a really long time. The servers really go out if their way to provide the customer a nice experience. The environment and the food are also amazing. I highly recommend their smoked ribs. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"We were looking for a cozy place for a reasonable yet delicious meal. This bistro definitely satisfies in every way. Attentive staff and creative food. For starters we had a very tender mini calamari on savoury couscous. We enjoyed the crispy duck confit special and the beef cheek poutine for dinner and ended with a donut and caramel. Duck and donut - how can you go wrong ?! We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for dinner last night because on a different occasion while walking by the restaurant the owners had a friendly chat with us and piqued our interest. Last night was no exception, everyone was  my boyfriend went with a tasting menu and I went with the ribs. His tasting menu was really worth the price because you get a good portion of food and get to try so many yummy items from the menu. My favourite from him? The salmon tartar! My ribs were melt off the bone perfection. My fries came with a homemade pepper mayo and which was great. Would we go there again? Yes!"}
{"text":"Ok. So it was my husbands birthday and I found this place. My husband wasn't sure about it. I think god is in the kitchen because we were in heaven our whole meal. This is a must stop while in Montreal. I never write reviews but this place was fabulous!  Thank you guys for such a great experience!  We chose the menu flight it was awesome. I'm very finicky and this place over performed. What a great surprise for a restaurant I picked because of yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Brought at group of 8 guys for a bachelor party here. We had an incredible time. The 3 brother team that runs the restaurant was amazingly accommodating of our party and even had a personalized sign for our table as we walked in the door. Wine and food selection are perfect: short but well thought out and quality. The food was absolutely incredible, especially considering the price. We had probably half the items on the menu and they were all phenomenal. Drinks and wine were also on point. I had a drink with burnt rosemary that the waiter / bartender actually burnt right in front of us at the table. Quite the presentation. 11/10 would come again!"}
{"text":"Creative and incredibly delicious food. The chef is amazing. Stopped here late one night and the staff and chef created a feast for us. Very accommodating and great service. Incredible poutine.  An absolute gem!"}
{"text":"I am SO sad that we found this place on our last day in Montreal! It was such amazing food and service that I would have gone back every day if I had more time. My husband had the smoked salmon, mushroom risotto, and beignets. I had the grilled romaine salad, tomato and basil pizza, and maple pudding. All of it was fantastic, but I'd say the mushroom risotto was the winner overall. It's a little pricey, but for the quality and taste I'd say it is actually a steal!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food, atmosphere, and service. Although we waited longer for our food because there was a mix up in the kitchen the food was worth the wait. Poutine was so flavorful. I had the duck which was good but not as good as the poutine. Definitely would come here again to try other dishes. Prices were very fair."}
{"text":"When we asked for delicious food, our reggae-playing Uber driver went rouge and dropped us off at this bistro. Seedy as hell looking at night in this neighborhood but we were hungry and in for whatever. The drinks were game set on point and the food was one of our favorites during our trip. Uhhh, thanks Uber...???! Our meal: Burger with a fancy presentation for the guy. I opted for a single sized pizza. Great date night!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant!!! I stumbled onto this hidden gem as we were looking for a restaurant between our place in the Plateau and my friend's hotel on Rue St. Denis. Came in on a Thursday evening for a late dinner. They have a nice outdoor area but we opted to dine in the cozy interior. The vibe is casual chic with a welcoming feel and I was amused they were playing hip hop. We were taken good care of by 'Laki' who we later came to realize is one of the trio of brothers who own the restaurant. I always get nervous when dining in restaurants with small menus that someone either won't find something they want or they won't like it. This place didn't disappoint from the pork and short ribs, to the salads, to the wine and cocktail recommendations everything was exceptional!! We finished it off with a platter of beignets  with berries drizzled with chocolate and caramel! I almost died twice SO good! Overall we couldn't have asked for a better meal on our first evening in Montreal. You should definitely come here!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok. The service was amazing but the food wasn't that good. The pictures make this place look rather upscale but it is not fancy at all. It has the vibe of a pizza counter mixed with a dive bar."}
