{"text":"If you haven't been to Cafe Vita for dinner you must!! Quaint and charming and absolutely delicious Italian fare. The artichoke appetizer is a great start. I can't imagine not liking anything on the menu. I usually try a special and have not been disappointed. With your entree you get a salad and crusty bread with dipping oil and portions are generous. Yum! I'm hungry :)"}
{"text":"I came to Cafe Vita for brunch on a Saturday. We were very excited to go because their breakfast menu looks amazing. They have a lovely atmosphere, cosy yet classy. Unfortunately they don't serve breakfast after noon. We had all made up our minds and were ready to order when they finally told us that they weren't serving half their menu anymore. Their menus had suggested that they have breakfast/lunch until 2 so we were pretty disappointed.   Cafe Vita gets only one star not because of this misunderstanding but because of their service and food quality during the meal. There was only one waitress for the small restaurant. She was very hard to flag down after she forgot to take our drink orders and later refill our drinks. The food was a disappointment for half of our large party. The side salads were good. However the chicken panini was a miss on flavor and far too bready. And the cheese ravioli were over cooked and grainy.   After the table next to us were ordering the chef came out to apologize that they were out of what the table had ordered. He brought out the alternative, a frozen bag of pasta. Not really the best etiquette or greatest sales pitch. (Probably why my ravioli was so mushy.)"}
{"text":"Love this place! A small, unique BYOB that has an Italian/French flair. The artichokes Romano are fantastic! Cafe vita is my favorite place to introduce to friends/family in Oakmont. Delicious, fresh pastas, seafood and meat dishes. Cafe vita always has interesting specials as well- typically a fresh fish special, as well as pasta/meat specials too. The portions are a good size as well, I always end up taking some home. Entrees come with a delicious salad and bread with dipping oil. And, who doesn't love BYOB? Liquor store is right down the street if you need to grab a bottle of wine. The Oaks movie theater is right next door for a great dinner and a movie date night (theater is also BYOB). Try this small town gem, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We dined this evening as a party of six.  We started with an order of their arancini (rice balls) and their greens and beans for the table.  The arancini got a unanimous thumbs-up from our group, but not much was said about the greens and beans.  I personally found the greens and beans to be tasty, but the arancini was clearly the better of the two.  I ordered their braciole, based on a recommendation from one of our group who had been here previously, only to learn that they only had one serving of braciole.  I should note that our party were the only diners in the restaurant while we were there.  I passed on the braciole to allow our birthday girl (this was a birthday celebration) to have it. Everyone received a house salad, and most chose to augment it with gorgonzola cheese, except for my wife who chose feta. The salads were good and not too filling.  My wife and I both ordered pumpkin ravioli in sage brown butter sauce.  We agreed it was tasty but we both would have liked more butter sauce on our raviolis.  I was given a taste of the braciole and would have been very happy with that entree.  Other meals ordered by our party were the pork chop Milanese, scallops wrapped in prosciutto, and lamb with polenta and asparagus.  We heard no complaints.  Most ordered desert.  We split an order of their apple Carmel cake, which was delicious.  Cafe Vita is a BYOB with one of the least expensive corkage fees we have encountered; $5 total for our party of 6, with 4 bottles of wine consumed. Remarkable!  Service was fine, totally unobtrusive, but water glasses and bread baskets were refilled when needed without our asking.  I hope they can attract enough business to stay open.  We'd love to return."}
{"text":"Nick & I have been wanting to try this place for a long time now and finally we were in the area and so we did!  We have been to several places for breakfast in PIttsburgh, but by far this was the BEST BREAKFAST we have ever had!    We both got the Spinach & Feta (Onions, roasted red pepper, sundried tomato, mushroom, spinach and feta cheese) Omelet.  David, the owner/chef was wonderful and made our omelets with \"egg whites\".    The egg whites were cooked to perfection!  It sat on a bed of tender baby spinah, roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, red onions and a slight amount of feta cheese.  Everthing complemented eachother and left our mouths wanting more!  The wonderful Breadworks Bread topped it off!    Very clean and comfortable place.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"}
{"text":"A very cute and under-rated cafe in one of my favorite towns outside of Pittsburgh.   Oakmont is part of the way between my where my parents live and the East End where I live, so it is a popular destination for brunch for my mom and I.   We were encouraged by a friend to try Cafe Vita in the small, unassuming store front. WOW. We were not disappointed one bit, and so totally more impressed by any of the other brunch spots around the burgh. There are too few really good ones, aren't there?  I have tried several of their omelets, of which the Black Bean and Spinach and Feta ones are my absolute favorites. Quality food, with the tastes considered. Not the run-of-the-mill breakfast that is so often found at Pittsburgh breakfast/brunch spots. Plus they give you a big hunk of Breadworks bread with your meal that is such a delicious complement.   Solid quality on the coffee as well, with friendly service. My mom and friends were yapping away after they had closed, and they did not mind one bit to refill our coffees and let us carry on while they did their dinner prep and clean-up. Much appreciated.   It never seems to fill up the way other brunch spots do in the area or otherwise, hence the underrated description. So go! I want to go back to try their dinner menu, and if it's anything like Breakfast, I am in for a tasty meal."}
{"text":"This is my hometown coffee shop if I'm able I stop by here for my coffee on the weekend.  It's a  tiny little joint located on Allegheny River Blvd.  It has a few 2 and 4 top tables and some nice large chairs with plenty of magazines and newspapers laying about.  The staff is always friendly and genuinely interested in making you happy.  I can't claim to be a gourmet with respect to coffee, but I have always found my medium coffee, hot, dark and tasty with fresh cream and accompianments at the plenty.  They also have a selection of pastry and sandwiches, but the reason that inspired me to write this review was this past Sunday I stopped in for some coffee found myself with some time to kill and decided to have brunch.  I didn't even know they had the capability to cook anything on site, but I was wrong.  I ordered a western omelette which was a delicious two egg omelett served with very high quality ingredients (ham, red onion, red pepper, spinach, etc...) cooked light and perfectly with the eggs being fluffy and airy.  I asked for bacon for the side, but they were out.  However, the guy offered to \"run next door\" and buy some for me.  I settled on the sausage which was okay, not homemade or anything memorable.  There are not many other options in Oakmont for coffee or sunday brunch, so you could do a lot worse than this place for a nice light breakfast."}
