{"text":"Reserved a table for 4 re Winterlicious. Although we were seated on arrival, staff could not find our reservation.  Asked for still water, should have asked for 'tap' as we were charged for it Bread was great Mixed green and arugula salad w goat cheese was good, but only came w arugula as the green.  Soup of the day was luke warm (a pre-cursor for things to come) Entrees were flavourful, but the salmon was cold, although the plate was hot. Lamb shank was 'good', but upset stomach later?? Service was good, but always annoying when you need to get someone's attention to get the check.  Surroundings very pleasant, well decorated.  Surprised to see an automatic 18% surcharge for service for 4 diners.  Unfortunately, will not return, although with some tweaks it may be a very pleasant spot for dinner."}
{"text":"I came here for Winterlicious with my cousin and had a wonderful dining experience. Giving 5 stars because not only was the food absolutely delicious, but the staff was welcoming and down-to-earth. Our server, William, deserves a high-five for being so friendly, talkative and attentive throughout the evening. As for the food, I ordered the lamb shank and off the bat, it was braised to perfection...great portions, fall-off-the-bone meat and great selections to choose from. Highly recommend dining here - kudos to the staff and talented chef :)"}
{"text":"Just got back from my cousin's birthday gathering. I was kind of skeptical at first because of the number of negative reviews, plus we were coming during Summerlicious and it's sort of an unspoken expectation that the experiences *usually* are not as good since you're paying far less than you would the rest of the year.  With that being said, our server, Will, was FANTASTIC -- incredibly accommodating and attentive (never had to ask for water to be refilled, consistently did quality checks, suggested dishes, made conversation, etc.). The atmosphere is definitely romantic... mood lighting, candles, etc. Perfect for date night... I made a mental note.  I ordered from the regular menu: App: Broiled goat cheese and arugula salad (also on the Summerlicious menu) - $8 Main: Monkfish and coriander risotto - $24 Dessert: Vanilla Créme Brûlée - $6  I was informed that they didn't have any monkfish, but they'd be happy to give me tuna steak instead for the same price (which would have been $35). When I received it, Will told me that is was cooked medium rare, but if I would like it done differently, they'd be happy to change it. It was delicious as is.  We had an 8-person party, so I can't comment on the 18% automatic gratuity that people have complained about. But I gladly gave an additional tip because the service was really superb. The rest of the party was going to go for karaoke and asked Will if there was a good place nearby. He called his favorite place and even reserved them a room under his name so they would't have to wait.  Great experience; I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Went there with two girlfriends for Winterlicious. Food and service were decent, atmosphere and space pleasant. I haven't noticed anything particularly \"Portuguese\" about the place, apart from the sardines and desserts which were incredible. 18 % automatic tip for three diners after HST was out of line."}
{"text":"Had my kids communion party here and went to a baptism here also.  There is a side for private parties, that fits about 25-30 people and space for a cake table. Nice space for a larger group and the food is really good.  For my party I called and discussed menu selections the day before so that I knew what the specials would be. Excellent, friendly service and very patient and accommodating.  Food is excellent.  Go with the specials as the fish has just come in and the meats. Lots to choose from and pricing is fair for the food you get.  Portuguese style cuisine, but not your home cooking.  Definitely better."}
{"text":"You should enjoy the food if you're not extremely critical. The sea food linguini was mediocre and on the greasy side. We had the skate fish, sole and sardine appetizer. They were well done. Overall I'd say 8/10 for the food and 7/10 for the service. The staff needs training. The waiter grinded the pepper right over my head (standing behind me). How silly is that? They needed to be friendlier and more attentive. It's not terrible but the enthusiasm was not there. If you don't care, you'll enjoy the food."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here. The first was during last years Winterlicious Festival and the second was last night for a birthday dinner. Our waiter was friendly and answered all of our questions regarding the menu or wines. Everyone enjoyed their meals very much and appreciated the Portuguese sized portions :D   My Grouper and risotto was an excellent suggestion. I had the lamb shank at my last visit which was just as delicious :)   I will definitely return for a third time in the future!!!"}
{"text":"We loved this place (5th time) but last week was just a horrible experience. We ordered two veal specials, the fish special, what was supposed to be Boar but we were told was just pork cubes because they ran out of boar ( it was dry) and a couple of other main courses. Everything was over cooked and over salted this time. We even asked if the chef was away for the March break but the waiter didn't get the hint and insisted he was there. Didn't offer to take back and redo the food.  The waiter also convinced us to try a different $65 wine then we usually have and insisted it was better than the one on the menu. It was not very good and even though he told us his brother brings it in from Portugal exclusively for them we found it at the LCBO for $16. It's a shame when a good place goes bad, for almost $400 it's just not worth it anymore. Bad new waiter and bad food.  We will never go back."}
