{"text":"I've been going to this place for about 18 years, so I feel like I know this place pretty well.

The pizza here is pretty good, if you're kosher this is the place to go. The falafel size here is REALLY stingy, and the fries aren't great.

In good 'ol Israeli fashion, the service is poor. Unless you're religious, the guys working are not friendly (even to 18 year long customers.) on the positive side, the girls working here are almost always good looking.

The price is pretty expensive. If you're kosher this might be reasonable, especially since the pizza's good. For those less restricted, there's better places."}
{"text":"The small white haired man here is a huge asshole. I came in and asked for a slice of pizza and pointed to the slice I wanted. He ignored me and took what looked like an older, dried out piece. When he took it out of the oven he said \"what did you say to me\". I said \" I wanted that (pointing to the piece I wanted). Hr said \"oh I heard you, but I'm the boss\". Seriously, what a prick. The slice was doughy and gross. Won't be spending my money here any time soon. What an asshole."}
{"text":"Food sucks, way overpriced and the staff are rude...the perfect trifecta to have a horrible food experience.

How do I give these guys zero stars? One is too generous."}
{"text":"I gotta tell ya, send a little love to the staff and they warm right up.  Pizza is one of the tastiest in Kosher Thornhill - it's hard to make great Kosher Pizza because of the Mezonos factor.  I think the other reviewers here are being a little harsh."}
{"text":"The owner is extremely rude and obnoxious. I called and ordered pizza to be picked up later. When I came to pick it up, the pizza was not even started. I asked when the pizza will be ready. Instead of answering, the owner yelled at me with an abusive language the whole time I was waiting for pizza. They won't stay in business  if customers are treated this way."}
