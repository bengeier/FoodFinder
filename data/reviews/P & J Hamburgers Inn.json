{"text":"I agree with the other reviews. The place looks sketchy and I don't think I'll dine in again, but I'll definitely get take out. The lady working there is really nice, prices are low, and the burgers are delicious. I saw that they have breakfast (maybe weekends only?) and there is also more to the menu than just the burgers, but I can't comment on it."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a while. Finally got around to it today. Took some pictures too.

As far as the decor goes. It's the worst ever. The interior appears to be hanging in the balance, between life and death. There is stuff everywhere, no lights on inside. Random boards, torn bar stools.

My burger and fries were acceptably good. Nothing remotely remarkable but decent. Burger was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Not bad, but not special.

Service was fine. One lady was working behind the counter, cooking and all. It wasn't busy easy enough for one person. She was really nice but I could hardly understand her through her accent.

Worth a visit for a fast food alternative, when you just feel like a greasy burger."}
{"text":"This lady makes it fresh! She is passionate about making her burgers! We love visiting the promenade and walking off the calories happily co aimed from these burgers!"}
{"text":"2.5 / 5

Tried this place out today, and all I can say is \"meh\".

The interior of this place looks like a bomb went off and then they decided to build a restaurant around the steaming wreckage.  Luckily, the service was pretty decent.  It was just one lady working alone who seemed enthusiastic at the very least, although it was a bit hard to understand what she was saying through her accent.

The burger itself was alright, I got the banquet burger.  It tasted good, was fairly juicy while crispy on the outside, and the bacon and toppings added to it were also good.  I think the burger itself was only like 4.50, which is pretty darn cheap as well.  The fries were average, nothing great but not horrible or anything.

This place could probably be a 3.5 / 5 if only they got some serious renovations done, but as it stands it's only a slightly better option than a fast food restaurant at best."}
{"text":"Great place for burgers. Their burgers are amazing, 100% homemade. It has a lot of toppings, and is very juicy. It takes 8 minutes to make a burger, making the wait a bit long though. Their fries are average. However, the inside needs more work. Inside, the decor looks like a hole in the wall place. However, the person working there was very enthusiastic. It was hard to understand her through her accent, but she can make a great burger! She makes up for the lack of decor. Their burgers are also very cheap, got a 1/2 pound for $3. I tipped her as well because her service was so great. A fries and drink and burger combo will cost $5-6, I think. 4 stars."}
