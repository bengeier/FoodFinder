{"text":"Definitely offered a lot more than I expected-groceries (the basics and some specialty items, mostly Italian), homemade takeout foods, and a full deli. They also did offer a fair amount of local treats from breads (tried the ciabatta today!) to biscotti and heirloom tomatoes to other Fall produce. What excited me the most had to be the NYC style pizza oven that warms up the part of the shoppe where a few tables are situated, having the option to enjoy whatever it is you find on the spot. Overall, employees are personable, top of the line products and an authentic family-market feel inside."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Besides CVS, closest shop to my workplace and made my coworker and I feel like a kid in a candy store. Try their sandwiches, salads, pizza, and variety of beverages (including pints of Millie's Ice Cream) and desserts!  Staff is friendly and front porch BBQ is AWESOME! Not too bad on the wallet, too."}
{"text":"A cute little shop that sells excellent lunch sandwiches. In particular, their buffalo chicken deli sandwich is spectacular and a great quick lunch option. Staff are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"A fantastic little neighborhood deli with great sandwiches and a lot more. 

I love the number of options at Food Shoppe - from their awesome sandwiches to pizza to a wide variety or prepared and packaged foods. 

I usually get sandwiches - all of which feature high-quality ingredients (particularly in the meat and bread areas). My personal favorite is the Blazing Buffalo Crunchy sub - deli buffalo chicken with crispy onions, buffalo sauce and cheese on a nice crunchy roll. 

Here are my tips: 
- Things get kinda crazy around lunchtime. I like to go around 11:30 or wait until 1 pm. That being said, even when you go at primetime the wait is reasonable. 
- Their deli case has some great pre-made options if you don't want a sandwich. Crab cakes are my preference, but I haven't had a bad experience with anything else. 
- Don't expect to go here instead of the grocery store. While they have some butcher and produce items, its really a pantry supplement kind of place. 
- Consider their catering and pre-made family meals. They are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love this little place nestled in the residential area of squirrel hill. It's little old time grocery with a meat counter, vegetable/fruit case, deli, prepared foods and cafe. They have all the staples you need if you are running short on something but comprehensive enough selection to build a great meal with their ingredients. Also have a fresh bread works bread. Great to grab lunch or dinner to go. I don't know how I'm just learning about this place."}
{"text":"Lots of offerings, nice people, but holy overpriced! I wouldn't buy most of what they had because the prices were so insane."}
{"text":"I've always walked and driven by this place but have yet to go in, after coming in twice within a week I can tell you I will be going here for lunch for a long time.  They have a ton of sandwiches, homemade soups, prepared foods and the staff is really friendly.  I felt a really good vibe being in there, very welcoming.

I was there for lunch and had a chicken panini that was really wonderful, the homemade soup was great too.

If you live in the area or are just passing through check this place out."}
{"text":"You always come home to the basics, y'know that?  After being out of town for two weeks, it was sure good to come back to Ruggeri's and sink my teeth into one of their fabulous grinders.  That and I bought a pint of their amazing soup to take home.  

Well their grinders are too big for me to consume in one sitting, so I cut mine in half and saved it for lunch today.  M-m-m-m-m!"}
{"text":"Why are people not worshipping this place!?! Where is the Review of the Day (ROTD) for Food Shoppe?  PIttsburgh Yelpers, this place is flipping amazing, and someone needs to get the word out about the Food Shoppe.

So if you've been reading my reviews, you know that my love of New York City and living in Astoria runs pretty deep.  Living in Pittsburgh makes me miss the food of Astoria greatly.  So imagine my delight when I found the Food Shoppe.  This is the closest thing to that type of neighborhood deli/ butcher you'll find in Pittsburgh.  The Food Shoppe is on my walk home, and we're going to have a beautiful relationship.  It's been cut short with the cold winter, but I will be back daily now that it is warm!

Deli:  Boar's Heads meats and cheeses at the same to slightly lower prices than the grocery stores.  However, they guys behind the counter can actually make recommendations, unlike the grocery store.

Create Your Own Sandwich:  Maybe the best part of this place.  You can create your own sandwich ($4.59) on fresh white, wheat, or rye bread with Boar's head meat and cheese.  At no additional cost, you can add lettuce, tomato, mayo, and/or mustard as well.  If you want extra meat, cheese, or a baguette it's only $1 more!  They have an amazing selection of meats and cheeses to chose from, which only makes it better.  I made a Buffalo chicken breast with chipotle gouda, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on rye the other day, and it was amazing.  Just trust me, and go get one!

Hot Meals:  There are different daily specials of grinders, sandwiches, etc.  Plus, in the summer, they have an entire grill menu.  Pretty cool!

Pizza Slices ($2):  This is what truly warmed my heart over.  For whatever reason, all of the delis near me in NYC had secret pizza ovens in the back of the store, and people would fight to get some amazing pizza out of the oven.  While this pizza isn't hidden in the back, I was super excited nonetheless!  What is better than a fresh slice of pizza?  And they'll throw it back in the oven for you to heat it up.  It's not the greatest pizza, but it's decent.

Cold Prepared Foods:  Lots of cold \"salads\" to choose from (i.e. Ham Salad, Chicken Salad, etc.).  They are sold by the pound so make sure to think about what you order.  I got a delicious pasta salad with tortellini, but tortellini is heavy.  A single scoop was $3 and not quite worth it.  However, the ham salad was $5.99/pound and quite delicious!

Take Home Prepared Meals:  There is a refrigerator with pre-made salads, pasta dinners, and other choices toward the front of the store as well.

Convenience Store:  So there is all of this food, but you can also stop here for all of your basic necessities.  Laundry detergent, snacks, sodas, and basic household needs are all here!

All of this and friendly employees too?  You bet!  There is a minimum purchase of $5 to use a credit card, but that seems reasonable to me.

Ok, Yelpers!  Don't let me down.  UFC this review up, go visit the store, and send some love to the Food Shoppe!"}
{"text":"I love this little market. The selection is wonderful, quality is high and price is very affordable. It's perfect for busy families, a quick stop on the way home from work. The prepared meals, soups & salads are interesting & delicious. I had their Lemon Chicken Risotto today and it was awesome. Shrimp Scampi is a favorite too. It has a little bit of everything...meats, baked goods, Wood St bread, sandwiches and they grill out in the summer months. I live within walking distance to Whole Foods but I'm just as happy to drive to Northumberland St. Oh! Almost forgot...Nancy B's cookies too!!! Nice people. Hi Denise!!"}
{"text":"Ruggeri's is a neighborhood gem. It's a small grocer and deli in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood in Pittsburgh. You can go here for anything from basic groceries, to fresh deli meat, to homemade bread. The highlight, though, is in the form of the freshly made sandwiches and the homemade take-home meals. If you don't feel like cooking, Ruggeri's will do it for you, and the food is great! Get the meatball hoagie (a Friday special) or the Italian wedding soup and save the hassle of cooking. Even better, since it's a neighborhood grocer, they'll get to know you when you come there, and they even have some customers on account! Try to find that at Giant Eagle."}
{"text":"This place is clearly a local's secret. I walked to the Food Shoppe for the first time today for lunch and I was delighted with the selection and the prices. I wanted a sandwich at the deli counter - got a tuna salad sandwich on wheat with lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles. The sandwich was $4.67 - what?! It was certainly not enormous, but it was a substantial sandwich for the price. I also got a small side of greek pasta salad - delicious. As I was checking out, I discovered the prepared food section and picked up a spinach, cranberry, walnut and cheese salad for later. All this for less than $15. I was wowed with the selection at a tiny neighborhood deli and butcher shop that also sells convenience store and grocery items! You can tell that everything is very fresh, good quality, and an excellent price point (for the deli and prepared food items).

I'll be going back again to try the barbeque next time. They grill outside on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the summer. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Ruggeri's is great! Full disclosure: it's on my walk/drive home from work. I'm not going to lie. It's ridiculously convenient. 

They have lots of great gourmet brands and delicious prepared foods. 

The staff is super friendly.

In the summer, they BBQ fresh lunches on their front patio!"}
{"text":"I have never in my life been treated so poorly at a grocery store/ deli. Terrible selection of food. I will never be going back and I will tell every person that suggests this place to eat how condescending and presumptuous the employees acted toward me.  I hope this place goes out of business and loses all financial support. 

Worst selection by far in sq hill. 
Overpriced."}
