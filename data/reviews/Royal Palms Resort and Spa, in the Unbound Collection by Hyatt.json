{"text":"Tired old nursing home of a property.  Back in the day, she was a beautiful supermodel.  Now, under Hyatt's supervision, a frumpy granny with a bad hip.  Service has lost its personal touch.  Rooms have bedding from the 1980s (literally); you can smell that decade in the rooms.  Piles of towels at the pool and room service trays in the hallways.  The fitness room is the size of a walk-in closet and half the equipment didn't work.  The bell staff was friendly and polished; nobody else was.  Good news though: free ice and cable TV.  Overpriced for the delivery of the experience.  Spoke to hotel staff about some small items -- rude, inattentive and entitled.  In Phoenix, so many more options that are sophisticated, contemporary and service-oriented.  As much as I have had some great stays here in the past, I'd avoid."}
{"text":"I have been to places all around the world and i will have to say that my expectations are very high.  I decided to go to the Palms and stay and all i got to say is i will never go back the resort was beautiful but the kitchen needs to reconsider finding help or something?  It was ridiculous and i am not going to waste my time talking about it.  Is there a chef there?"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful no words can describe the tranquility I am feeling. Great staff, immaculate, and will receive serious pampering.  You deserve it. Go"}
{"text":"Dinner at TCooks was by far one of the most delicious meals of the year! A 10! The renovated room is lovely and service was to match. If you have not been or perhaps have not visited in a while I would suggest making a reservations. Our table had a flawless meal- Lamb , Branzino, Beef Tenderloin, Seabass and Mushroom Risotto. Fantastic! We will be back very soon. Please don't change anything!!!"}
{"text":"This resort makes me feel like I have died and gone to heaven.  I didn't want to ever leave.  The pool area is so lovely and quiet is feels like a sanctuary -not at all like the noisy pools at most resorts.  And then there is the restaurant, T.Cooks, which is amazing!  An outstanding menu by a talented chef and the ambiance of dining in a Mediterranean villa.  Staying here is a real treat!"}
{"text":"This resort is just as nice as the Four Seasons.  I really like the service.  People are attentive and friendly.  It's a historic hotel, so it has history to it.  T.Cook's is DELICIOUS.  Last night, they had a chef's tasting menu that included a dish he created on Iron Chef.  My mom had that dish.  What really stood out was my breakfast this morning.  I'm not a breakfast person at all; however, my french toast with homemade chicken sausage was excellent.  The rooms are beautiful and clean.  It is still kind of dark with all the lights on; however, just step outside during the summer and you'll get enough light.

The pool is small and not as nice as some other hotels I've stayed at, but that didn't bother me because as long as my toddler had a good time in there - that's all that matters to me.

I definitely will come back next time."}
{"text":"My daughter had her wedding here and as parents of the bride we stayed for 3 nights. My usual go to hotel in Scottsdale is the Westin Kierland...NO MORE!! The staff at the Palms is simply amazing! From the moment you are greeted by the valet you know your stay will be memorable. You are greeted like family and they just make you feel special! The food at T.Cook's is outstanding and the waitstaff is friendly and warm. The Chef catered the rehearsal and wedding dinners. Everything we had was superb! Especially memorable was the enchiladas, churros, huevos rancheros, lamb chops and steak. Oh yes, and the salted caramel gelato! OMG!!!
The grounds are immaculate and stunning and being decorated for Christmas made it even more magical. Lots of cozy nooks to sit in and just read or work. Wi fi is strong and free to Hyatt members (it costs nothing to be a member)."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!  I have stayed in probably over 100 hotels, this one was the BEST hotel I have ever been to... staff was extremely friendly, I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in AZ and won't be the last. My husband and I spent 3 nights using our World of Hyatt points. Everyone from the front desk to the room service workers were so pleasant and accommodating. We had breakfast and our anniversary dinner at T Cooks- food, service and special touches were top notch! 
Our casita was an up grade and very nice! It had a private patio, fireplace, soaking tub and large shower. 
Pool and the grounds were beautiful and well kept. 
Royal Palms will be our go to stay in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I went to the Royal Palms for a conference hosted by IBM last week.  We had a catered lunch in a small conference room which was delicious (an assortment of sandwiches and tossed salads, champagne, wine) while the guest speakers were presenting.  The wait service was friendly and catered to every whim.  One of the bartenders gladly offered to make me a mimosa when I was hesitant to go for champagne.  

I also got a 90 minute deep tissue massage (current rate is $200) by Evan on a secluded balcony with a beautiful view of the mountains.  I mentioned that I thought I had pulled my piriformis so he worked every muscle in my a$$ (yes, that's where it's located!) and even told me the names of all of them, hahaha.  He asked about the amount of pressure, how I was feeling, etc.  I felt extremely comfortable with him and he definitely fixed my piriformis!  We had nice conversation until the pain ended and the relaxing began and I started to doze off.  

We also received gift certificates for the shop in the spa.  They have the usual type of products you would expect: body lotions, facial masks, candles, etc.  I bought a strawberry and kiwi shower gel and lotion set which smells insanely delicious.  (I think it actually put the idea of happy hour into my head...)  I also loved one of their perfumes, but for a tiny travel size bottle I believe it was $50!  

Everybody is very attentive and pretty hands off at the spa and you can relax indoors or out before or after your treatment(s).  They provide big, comfy bath robes and slippers as well as lockers.  The only complaint I have is they don't have a nice, private place to change your clothes.  I changed mine in the restroom which has tile flooring, slats in the door so you're paranoid somebody can see in, and nowhere to hang up your clothing.  But maybe I just missed private changing areas.  

If you ever get a chance to spa here, do it!"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful resort! My room was so spacious and the shower was huge. The little patio area in the back was walled off so it was very private, which I loved. The pool area is nice and relaxing. Staff are friendly. The only bad thing is that since it's so close to camelback mountain, you may get mosquito bites, so come prepared with spray."}
{"text":"Hate to leave this oasis in the desert.  My love brought me here to celebrate my birthday and it was a memorable one for sure.  I truly enjoyed our three night stay from the spa to simplying sitting in our peacefu patio.  It's a relaxing resort and a great place to disconnect from your everyday life and recharge.  I hope to return in the future and will highly recommend Roya Palms to everyone!"}
{"text":"Just came from an amazing spa day here!  The only bad part was the wait staff at the pool. At most, there was 15 people there with two employees yet we had to go up to the bar four times to get service. We always tip 20% or more but we were actually going to leave 10% to reflect the service. Turns out they receive an automatic 20%. Definitely explains why don't they try at all. 
So one star for pool service. Five stars for the main restaurant and spa"}
{"text":"DO NOT GET MARRIED HERE! This resort is beautiful from the outside, but start peeling back the layers and you will see an ugly company that will nickle and dime you at every turn. My wedding experience turned from one of joy and happiness to a feeling of dread and nausea at every turn with this company.  THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW UP FRONT: Expect to pay a 22% service charge that is TAXED with the sales tax + the regular sales tax on top of your bill. Also, plan to spend $100 per bartender and be expected to tip several key people during the reception, despite the service charge. Also, plan to pay $4.00 per every car that valets at your wedding. If you want a list of who actually used the valet, forget it. Expect to meet every deadline they give you with your payments, but do not expect such promptness from them. And if you use their \"preferred vendors,\" remember who some of those vendors really work for at the end of the day... I have my contract on record for anyone who wants a glimpse at the \"whole picture.\" Trust me when I say that the beautiful, sugary sweet image you get on your initial visit, will not depict the financial reality here."}
{"text":"Beautiful Spanish Colonial Hotel, the Royal Palms is a nice place to get away for a few days.  Hotel and grounds very well kept for an older hotel.  Staff courteous and professional.  The room spacious and comfortable, with good AC (very important in Phoenix!).  And Hotel close to old town Scottsdale, and nice place with lots of shops and restaurants.  Only downside was that T. Cooks, the hotel restaurant, was closed for renovations during our stay; other than that, it was great, and I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Royal Palms for a wedding.  The grounds are gorgeous and the best service ever at T. Cooks by T. so ask for him if you go there.  The food was superb, and the ambiance in the restaurant great.  Never had better service by a waiter than T.  Front desk check in was great too.  The problem was the room.  The electricity in our room was shorting in the bathroom and more importantly the shower ran scalding hot and then cool.  Overall I do not know if I would stay again but for sure would go back and see T at T. Cooks and eat there again."}
{"text":"Beautiful resort and the staff is very friendly and helpful. They should put a room key access lock on the pool gates so only paying guests have access to pool."}
{"text":"You have to do this. If you are reading this that means you are thinking about it. Stop thinking. Do it. Impossibly romantic this Scottsdale hideaway is understated, intimate and refined. Curving walkways through bougainvillea and honeysuckle camouflage casitas and villas all with private terraces. The rooms are Mediterranean Spanish with fireplaces and comfortable sitting chairs at the base of the massive bed. Go for the designer casitas. No two are alike. They are all amazing. The entire resort is filled with nooks and crannies where you can find solitude and luxuriate with a cocktail while you soak in the scented breezes and warm sun. It's like a private residence you have to yourself with a few others. The service is over the top good. Room service twice a day including turn-down with ice buckets and spring water. Need your car? Make one call and it's waiting at the entrance. The spa is small but you have it to yourself. Steam room, jacuzzi, massage. Do it again before martinis and a fabulous meal at T. Cooks, the on-site four star restaurant. In short, for a three day romantic getaway, there is no place I'd rather be than the Royal Palms."}
{"text":"I have been a guest at the Royal Palms for the past 5 years and love this resort for many reasons. My husband and I chose to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary here this past weekend and while we enjoyed our visit there are few things that need improvement at this resort. 

I will start with the \"pros\" because I truly believe the place is magical and should be the best resort in the valley. The hotel is gorgeous! The grounds are so lush and it truly is an escape in Phoenix. I love the history of the hotel and reading the book in the room describing the history. The rooms are very private and we love the boutique feel. Also, we splurged for a cabana and that was nice even though the price was very high. The staff is friendly- especially the valet guys and the poor staff working out in the heat by the pool. 

The \"cons\" for this particular trip... first, the pool was extremely dirty. It got to the point that I couldn't even be in the water. Some of the debris was due to all of the palms shedding but in addition to that there were tons of dead bugs, hair, and the water was very cloudy. While much of this is due to the pool being heavily used and that it is very small, possibly the resort could have a staff member clean it hourly to help keep it up- especially when you are paying $15 per drink. If you are an early riser, be aware that there are no services at the pool until 11am. I love the small boutique size of this hotel but unfortunately I thinK they need to renovate the pool and/or upgrade the size in order to stay competitive in the area. 

Next, the spa was very disappointing this trip. I paid for a facial and the technician spent the first 25 minutes lecturing me. I was basically told that I am wasting my money getting a facial if I don't do at home skin care regimens and if I spend any time in the sun. I am all for education, but I was not visiting a dermatologist, I just wanted a little extra pampering and glow during my vacation. The steam room was not available the first couple of days. The third day it was open but it had a horrible mildew and sewer smell. This same sewer smell was in the shower as well. Usually at spas, there is staff that cleans frequently between people using it. This was not the case here as there was shaving cream all over the walls of the shower, hair on the floor, dust in the lockers, debris on the carpet in the locker room. My robe in my locker did not have a belt so I had to stand out in the lobby holding it closed until the receptionist was finished talking to other people to give me one. And I had mosquitos buzzing in my ear while lounging in the waiting room. This spa is very small compared to other local resorts. 

Valet guys were prompt and very friendly but unfortunately they parked my hubby's new black car under a tree overnight and it had 20 or so white bird droppings all over the car. They were apologetic and made certain it didn't happen the next two nights. 

In regards to the rooms they could use some updating to stay in line with the high price tAgs per night. Our bed was very wobbly, we had to force our door open with our hips, our phone didn't work the first day and the refrigerator is not cold. Lighting is poor as well. You have to call for ice and when they come they bring you a very small bag. 

Lastly, the personalized romantic feel of this resort has changed. In the past they provided bottled water for free each day and turn down service. Now it is part of the mini bar. In the past we also were treated extra special on our anniversary with chocolates and champagne. While it isn't necessarily an expectation, we were a little bummed we didn't receive anything special In our room like we did for our 10 yr. Some other recent guests (within the last month) posted reviews on other sites that they were upgraded to nicer rooms and received champs and chocolates in their rooms. Wonder why some get it and some don't? I will note that my husband told the restaurant we were celebrating so we got flower petals and a bite of dessert (seriously it was one forkful each) at our dinner at T Cooks. My husband enjoyed his dinner at T Cooks but I did not enjoy this menu compared to our last trip a few years ago. 

Overall, I still love this place but I hope it gets a little TLC before our next trip!"}
{"text":"Nice Tuscan style resort. I came her for a spa day with a group of people. The staff were friendly and attentive. My main complaint is that the locker room was super tiny. Every time I went in to grab something from my locker, or to change, it was uncomfortable as I bumped into strangers and tried to stay out of everyone's way. Only 2 people can fit comfortably in the area. The pool was small, nothing fancy. Decent food/drink poolside."}
{"text":"This place oozes romance and ambiance!!! I'd give 4.5 stars if possible. Only taking half a star due to issues with the pillows, feather pillows that smelled gross, very large but flatten and not very comfortable. We just stayed here for our anniversary and by no fault of the resort, we were given a room with two double beds instead of a King (we booked through a 3rd party). Unfortunately, all of the King rooms were sold out. However, what a surprise to have a knock at our door with a bottle of champagne and an anniversary plate of chocolate covered strawberries! This was such a thoughtful and nice touch, really made our stay that more enjoyable. The grounds were absolutely lush, tranquil and magical. Just gorgeous and full of history and romance. Definitely a place for romance. All of the meandering pathways are so fun and beautiful to stroll. Of note, all of the casita rooms are currently undergoing renovation. I know that Hyatt now owns this resort. A sign had a picture of the \"finished product\" and I was underwhelmed with the appearance for an upgrade. I truly hope that Hyatt respects and maintains the beauty of this historical property and not create \"cookie cutter\" modern rooms that lack the charm and ambiance of such a unique property. That being said, this place is magical and I look forward to staying again in the future. Thank you for the wonderful memories Royal Palms!"}
{"text":"Absolute Heaven.

My husband and I decided on a stay-cation for our two year wedding anniversary and decided to stay at The Royal Palms based on reviews and the curb appeal of this beautiful resort. It looks similar to our wedding venue and we got an amazing deal (they price matched a \"budget\" travel website that I was skeptical of). When we made the hotel reservation, we also made reservations for the restaurant, T. Cooks and they asked if we were celebrating anything special.

Upon checking in, our hotel key holder stated our name and \"Happy Anniversary\"  and they upgraded us to a suite as a present! Very nice. The bellman showed us to our room, which was beautiful. We immediately got changed into our swim suits and checked out the pool. It is small but is fine for the size of the resort. We ordered mojitos poolside and had a great afternoon!

After getting ready for dinner, we walked the grounds before our reservation. The resort is nestled up right against Camelback and there are lots of courtyards and hidden gems around the property. We went to the bar for happy hour (great happy hour deals) and then went to T. Cooks for dinner. Our table had rose petals and candles and our menu said Happy Anniversary on it! Our meal was fabulous and when it came time for dessert, they brought over their special for the evening and in chocolate writing, it said Happy Anniversary! We truly felt like we were being treated like royalty! When we got back to the room, our bed had been turned down and there was a platter of fruit and chocolates and it also had the chocolate writing that said Happy Anniversary on it! Wow! This is the place to go if you are celebrating! 

This resort is amazing. The hotel is gorgeous, the grounds are beautiful and you will be treated like you are the only two people in the world! Thank you and we will be back!"}
{"text":"5+ visits here.   We stay at Royal Palms to get away:  from noise, from music, from kids, from crowds.  Service is top notch.  Get a Casita room (or if you can swing it, one of the Villas with outdoor showers...)

Come here for Romance and to stay on property.  T Cook's is one of the top restaurants in Phoenix.  No need to leave. 

The pool is nice and quiet, but small.  Not a \"Resort\" pool.  Not a pool \"Scene\".  But a perfect spot to read a book, have a cold drink, and relax.

Work out room is fine.  If you want to lift/run/stretch, use it.  

Spa is really nice.  Worth going into once or twice during your stay."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here every year for our anniversary in July.  The resort is beautiful, but the reason we keep coming back is the service.  From the moment we drive up, to lounging by the pool, to coming back from our anniversary dinner, the service is always above and beyond our expectations.  I will say however, the rooms are a bit of a toss up: sometimes we get a really nice room, and sometimes they are a little run down."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the spa. I would give the hotel itself 3.5 to 4. 
The hotel and restaurant are great. The spa is beautiful BUT BE WARNED, it is incredibly overpriced. I got a sub par massage for $170 (the guys seemed very inexperienced and clumsy) and worst of all a HORRIBLE pedicure that cost $100. Yes, you read that right $100. For that kind of money you expect all kinds of luxurious tinctures and specialized leg and foot massage treatments. NOT AT ALL - hardly a foot rub, basically roughed up rather than smoothed my feet and the polished lasted 3 days. HORRIBLE!!! I have had far, far, far superior pedicures for $15. Don't be fooled by the fancy name of the treatment, it isn't worth it.
Facial was very good however."}
{"text":"I don't come to Royal Palms to be socialize or work on my tan by the pool. Honestly, the pool is nothing to write home about. There is really no nightlife to speak of either. That's what Tally Ho is for. I love the Royal Palms because the service is extraordinary. From the moment you check in to the moment you leave, the staff makes you feel like a VIP. We arrived early for our check in on our last visit with perishable foods in our trunk because of a mistake I made. The bellhop courteously stored our food in a cooled storage space until we could go to our room. The rooms are absolutely gorgeous. I never want to leave because the bed is insanely comfortable and the showers are extremely large. Honestly, the bathrooms are quite stunning. If you call the bellhop for anything, they will deliver it to your room quickly and with a smile. I can't tell you how many times I've been to an upscale hotel or restaurant and been treated like a third class passenger find a lifeboat on the Titanic. There is nothing more insufferable than being treated by staff like I don't deserve to be there because of the way I dress or speak or who knows. I may not make much money, but I do like to treat myself once in a while, and my money spends just as well as anyone else's. At the Royal Palms, I get to feel like a millionaire, if only for a few days.
 I can't speak much of the other amenities because I never want to leave my room! I will say that I wish they had more than one pool because when my boyfriend and I tried to go, there was not an unoccupied pool chair in sight. And when we finally did find two, there were too many bees to enjoy ourselves. However, this is Arizona and there are many places to swim. Excellent customer service is a much harder find, and Royal Palms has it."}
{"text":"This is not a place to just sleep, you WANT to STAY here and not leave.   The grounds are so beautiful, flowers typically found in the South Pacific are all over the grounds.  Great food, quiet pool and lovely rooms."}
{"text":"While I've never stayed on the property, my fiancé and I love going and eating and having drinks at the bar, especially during happy hour when they have $5 apps and drinks. Happy hour is from 4-7 which is great bc if you go at like 6:30, it's basically normal dinner time for half the price! It such a gorgeous place that we even took our engagement pictures here! I definitely recommend going there as it is so gorgeous, and happy hour is a great deal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just returned from a trip to Arizona, made GLORIOUS by this gorgeous boutique resort.  From the moment we arrived we were greeted with authentic kindness and care. We were whisked from our car, straight to a simple check-in area [complete with delicious iced tea and lemonade] and given a tour of the grounds as we were shown to our room.  
 
All the rooms in this resort are 'casitas.' Basically, you get your own little house with a kitchen, sitting area, big bathroom and lovely bedroom with plenty of storage space and dressers for each person to have their clothes.  Turn down service happens nightly and the cleaning crew seems to sneak in and out of there anytime you are gone.

The pool is lovely, and again, the staff is welcoming and remember who you are after meeting you only once.  Also, they could gouge you on the prices there, but guess what THEY DONT.  [Especially in terms of resort standards]

We also had a couples' massage at the spa which was incredible. Before the massage you can hang in your separate locker rooms which have a eucalyptus steam room that leads to an outdoor jacuzzi and shower, as well as lounge chairs to chill in the sunshine before you have your service.  When our awesome massages were complete, we were handed champagne on the way out and instructed to take a quick steam and shower to help pull out the toxins brought up by our massage.  Again, the staff was incredible and caring and I love them!

One cool thing about this resort is that they provide an environment where you don't need to feel obligated to tip at every turn [except at the restaurants] by instilling a very reasonable daily resort fee [$28].  This included unlimited valet parking, which was worth it alone!

All of this and I never even mentioned how gorgeous the grounds are. Immaculately kept, thoughtfully designed landscaping surround these historical grounds, and the rooms are lovely as well.   This is also a fairly small resort, which is nice because you end up being a part of a nice, intimate community of vacationers.  And on our trip, it was 95% adults. We saw one child the whole time we were there.  [Not that I don't like children, but it's nice to have some peace on vacation :)

All in all I can't express how enamoured we both were by our stay here. We felt very special, were greeted with smiles and 'hellos' everywhere we went and treated like royalty. It's a great place to go for a romantic getaway, OR to have your wedding! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to have a day of relaxation. Rather than stay at home we went to the Royal Palms Resort to have lunch and take advantage of the spa.  I have to tell you we had the best experience with everyone we encountered from the staff.   From the moment we got out of our car and was greeted by Thomas, to our server Brian who we enjoyed conversing with.  Then we spent the day at the spa.  I had the stone massage given by Dawn who was absolutely the best.  My fiancé had her Mani/Pedi by Geri who was outstanding.  We then ventured down to the pool.  Both Anthony and Steven were awesome to deal with, making sure we had everything we needed.  After the poolside bar closed we were still a little hungry so we jumped on the poolside phone and had a wonderful burger by Jerry at poolside.   

We have had such a memorable time today we are already looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"This resort is beautiful. The grounds, pool, fitness center, and other amenities are amazing. If you are from snowy Chicago, Wisconsin, Minnesota and you want to getaway to beautiful Scottsdale AZ and enjoy serenity and comfort, you should consider Royal Palms Resort and Spa. Unfortunately, I had a bad experience at TJ Cooks restaurant for lunch. I ordered the flat iron steak and eggs. Except for the hash browns, the rest of the dish was INEDIBLE. I could have eaten a better meal at Denny's for a fourth of the price. I also ordered the Panini, a dessert combo of peanut butter, chocolate and bananas sandwiched inside a panini bread. This was also disappointing. My wife ordered the eggs sardou. It was cold and had no flavor but the hash brown potatoes were great. I'm hoping they had a substitute cook that day and this isn't their normal standard of taste. Again, you shouldn't miss the Resort, but I had reservations about TJ Cooks."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and love the the property.  It's beautiful- the colors are vibrant, Camelback Mt. makes a lovely backdrop, and there are dozens of great little areas to sit, relax, read, talk and have a drink.  The bar is wonderful as well and I heard some great live music while sipping a delicious walnut manhattan.

The only negative is about the rooms.  The first time I stayed, I had a beautiful room with good natural lighting and a nice outside patio- perfect for having some personal outside space to enjoy the great weather.  The second time, however, although I was at the same room rate I ended up in a room that didn't have a patio or balcony- in fact, it hardly had any outside light coming in at all. I felt like I was in a cave the entire time I was in my room (and happy I wasn't the one paying- I would have been really annoyed to have spent so much money and ended up with that room).   

When I asked about switching to a room like I had had previously, the only response I received was that they couldn't help me this time (the property was full) but that they would make a note in my file that I prefer a room with a patio or balcony (seriously, who wouldn't want this when they are staying here?).  I strongly recommend to make a note when you are making a reservation here- you want a patio or balcony!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place for a wedding. Ambiance was incredible. I didn't stay here, but I definitely would in the future. We stayed down the street at the Phoenician, which was also lovely, but for different reasons. 

I felt like I was in a Spanish villa. So quaint and relaxed. Little nooks and crannies around every corner. Landscaping was phenomenal. The property is just amazing. 

The only downsides were the small pool and the food. I wouldn't come here if I had kids with me, but its a great setting for a romantic getaway. The food they served for the wedding dinner was sub par, especially at $140 a head. We had a meat and cheese plate for an appetizer but there was only 2 VERY small pieces of meat on the plate and lots of \"filler.\"  The lobster bisque also wasn't very good. The entrees were just okay. 

Glad we stayed at the Phoenician, but next time we might stay a night or 3 at the Royal Palms."}
{"text":"The moment I turned into the driveway i knew that I was in for a treat!
This place has got to be the most enchanted place I've ever stayed at. The grounds are breathtaking. There's a mini oasis every where you turn. There are stunning mosaics and art throughout the courtyard, beautiful 200 year old fountain which was brought in from Guanajuato MX. And a 24 hour pool?! That's unheard of!! 
Staff was absolutely lovely.
Can't wait to stay at this romantic oasis again."}
{"text":"Stayed here after getting a terrific deal on Expedia.  Saved over 250.00 per night as the room we booked was normally over 500.00 a night.  Loved this place, probably the best resort I've stayed at in Scottsdale so far.  Our room was a terrace suite over looking the pool and Camelback Mountain.  Had two terraces on each side of the room and the views were beautiful.  This time of the year all of the citrus trees were blooming so this fragrance of lemon/orange filled the air!  If you go here during the summer months when the temperature in AZ reach well over 110 degrees you can save even more on the rooms.. This is a perfect romantic getaway destination and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The pool area was pretty but the spa was dated . Terrible massage by male provider . Really sub par for a Hyatt property"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience.  Trenetta is a fabulous maicure/pedicure pro....plus on site bestie and the scrubs are magical.  A must when you're Arizona."}
{"text":"My husband and I snagged a travelzoo voucher and decided to stay here for a night. The resort is beautiful and the staff is extremely friendly. If you're looking for a quiet and quaint getaway this is the place to go. The pool was smaller than expected but we were there in July so it wasn't crowded and the cabana staff was very accommodating. My two issues were the food menu was quite limited (although they do offer a happy hour which is nice, but only offer certain foods at certain times, which is frustrating), and my pedicure at the spa was below average."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! Spectacular service from beginning to the end. The people in T. Cooks remember you and what you like. They are very attentive and nice. Love their Sunday brunch! Cannot find anything like it here in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to my stay at the resort over Memorial Day weekend but have to admit the I was a little disappointed with the resort. Service at the restaurant, T Cooks, and by the pool was not quite up to par. We found that we often had to flag down waiters and waitresses to ask for drink refills, food and condiments. Service was not terrible, but it was annoying that the staff was not anticipating our needs prior to having us ask for everything. You have to pay a resort pool fee, which further adds to the excessive expense of this resort, and I did not feel I got my money's worth out of this fee. 

Another annoyance was the size of the pool and pool area, which was very small. Lounge chairs are crowded together and we had to fight for a chair every morning because there aren't that many.

I was also disappointed in the gym. It was very small and the tvs on the machines did not work. 

Nothing was majorly wrong, but the little things added up to this resort not fully adding up to our expectations. The grounds are beautiful (gorgeous flowers and plants!) but I do not think I do not think this resort is worth the cost."}
{"text":"We had the privilege of staying at Royal Palms on our wedding night. When we showed up, the staff was happy to bring our bags to our casita and help us start the fire. The resort is so romantic, and we had a bottle of champagne and fruit platter waiting for us. The casita was cozy, with a nice fireplace, large 4-poster bed, and a beautifully tiled large walk in shower. The one concern was that it seemed that gas was leaking from the fireplace when we turned off the fire. While I'm sure we could have called the staff to fix it, it was late and we ended up sleeping with the fire going all night (not the worst thing in the world!). We look forward to staying at Royal Palms again, and can hopefully spend more time exploring the grounds."}
{"text":"Pool servers and the spa therapist/manicurist were fantastic! They were exceptionally attentive.  That is the signature of royal palms - impeccable customer service!"}
{"text":"Beautiful!!! We were lucky enough to squeeze in here over spring break and we are so happy! Grounds were impeccable, service was outstanding, and food and drinks were delicious!
Would recommend happy hour, 3-630 great selection and great prices. Made our entire trip worthwhile!"}
{"text":"super nice resort.  the staff is friendly and the grounds are beautful.  i was here for a wedding and really enjoyed myself.  definitely recommend this place.  the prices of the room is a bit high though, but worth it for special occasions.  

the reception cocktail food and dinner was was very scrumptious.  we had brunch at t.cooks and the food was fab also!    

the rooms are spaceous and our room had a shower and tub that looked out to the living room.

the alvadora spa is a bit smaller, but very nice.  the showers were big, steam room was a good size.  the jacuzzi was a bit small, but fine.  the waiting area for treatments got a bit crowded though, and it was also a unisex waiting area.  the spa is pretty luxurious and a very nice treat if you're staying at the Royal Palms.  def a place i would recommend friends to go to for a relaxing weekend!"}
{"text":"My mother, sister and I had gone down to Arizona as a late celebration of Christmas, just a girls getaway. We were hoping for a location that is close enough to the activities we were hoping to enjoy in Scottsdale but not your typical hotel. The property was so beautiful and peaceful with cozy little nooks everywhere to sit and enjoy the landscaping and water features, as well as fire pits for the evening which we would sit around while we enjoyed some wine. The beds were comfortable and the restaurant on site- T. Cooks- was delicious! We enjoyed breakfast there everyday and dinner our first evening and had good service and wonderful time. They have live music in the bar as well a couple nights a week which was a nice touch. Genuinely recommend this property for anyone looking to have an oasis to return to when traveling."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Royal Palm over the weekend. It's a beautiful place and the staff was so accommodating and kind. I would highly recommend the Moscow Mules they brew their own ginger beer and they were delicious! We had breakfast which was also delicious and our server Tanino was very entertaining! We would definitely stay there again!"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend the Royal Palms for any type of stay while here in the valley  whether it be for business,romantic getaway to much needed leisure stay.  The Royal Palms offers guests always accommodating staff, tranquil surroundings with relaxing pool and spa.   Well appointed, comfortable rooms all help make for a pleasurable 'experience' not just a stay.  Sunday buffet a must DO !!"}

{"text":"The Royal Palms is so tranquil despite being near the heart of Scottsdale. Bunny rabbits run about and all you can hear is water trickling from fountains and the birds tweeting, it is SO quiet.

The food is great too at the restaurant on the grounds and not unreasonably priced.

We got a casita near the back of the resort which added to seclusive nature of the place but the room, although nicely decked out was much more claustrophobic and dark than those at the Montelucia or the Boulders. Plus the shower and the toilet were in the same room, a little weird. Wasn't thrilled by the floor plan or the excessively squeeky bed but the room was nice all the same.

Other than that, I would recommend the Palms for a staycation as it so relaxing and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"get married here!

i did and the attention to detail of the place itself and those that work on the premises is just phenomenal. the grounds are intimate and immaculate, but also in a way that isn't stuffy and pretentious - everyone in our wedding party and the guests felt so comfortable. we got married in the Alegria Garden for a small private ceremony and then moved to the Palmera Salon for reception festivities - loved it!! for lodging, we started out in a casita and then moved to a spa suite....and quite frankly, both rooms were so wonderful - relaxing and romantic.
if there is one downside to getting married at the Royal Palms (and this is a silly one, but i will mention), it's that there is no staging room for the bride and bridemaids to get ready....so we just met up in a friend's room, problem solved.
the setting and the wait staff made it so easy to have a wonderful wedding experience.....there will be anniversary trips back to the Royal Palms in my future for sure!!"}
{"text":"Between the friendliness of the staff and the quaintness of the hotel, I cannot say more about how amazing this hotel is. I arrived stressed and left relaxed."}
{"text":"If you're going to eat til your sides hurt, it's good to get an early start!

Thanksgiving in Arizona was a wonderful experience thanks to the feast we had here. We arrived at 11:15 and sat down for a 2.5 hour buffet enjoyed in their sunny side patio. This was my first time here and it's amazing to know that their renovations are fairly recent because you would never guess it! The Spanish style tile roofs, huge trees and beautiful overhanging Bouganvilla really set the tone for this place. It has so much character and thought put into the layout, you can't help but feel relaxed.

Thanksgiving Day brunch was wonderful! (If only you could take some home for leftovers!) Although I did miss doing some cooking of my own, I have to admit it was nice to skip out on grocery store madness and be pampered for a change! We finished 4-6 plates (the guys ate more!) from their cutting station: turkey, of course, pesto topped salmon, and prime rib, made to order omelettes, salads, and desserts. My only critique is 3 of us got a bowl of squash soup and it was so salty none of us could eat it. Must have been a fluke because the rest of the meal was delicious. They definitely have hired the best. Everyone we came in contact with was friendly, gracious and made us feel right at home. And in case you missed their Thanksgiving buffet or you want a repeat performance of their awesome spread, you can go a month later for their Christmas smorgasbord. 

I would love to stay here next time. From what I learned, each of the rooms were decorated by a different interior designer so they are all unique. As I was sitting in the courtyard, I couldn't help thinking, this would be a beautiful place for a wedding! (Don't tell the BF I said that!)"}
{"text":"This might be the most relaxing resort I've ever visited.  From the time you enter the property, you are transported to a place of relaxation and luxury.  The rooms, the grounds, the pool, the restaurant and lounge all make you want to just sink in and enjoy.  Everything is designed for comfort and no detail is overlooked.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"My man and I stayed here for a Cinco de Mayo staycation. It is a beautiful resort. I spent most of my time relaxing. We ate brunch at the restaurant. It has a beautiful patio and great service."}
{"text":"A truly gorgeous getaway spot.  Excellent grounds -- a real escape right in the middle of a sprawling city.  Beautiful and beautifully maintained.  Right at the base of Camelback Mountain, it's just *gorgeous*.

The staff was impeccable and friendly -- the service at T Cooks was some of the best we have ever had!!

We had some (maintenance) problems with our room, but they were quick to send staff to repair it, and were very quick with compensating us for the inconvenience.  We were already happy with the room, but the room they moved us to was a dream.

Amazing memories from a lovely lovely site.  Midweek days were even more lovely without the weekend rush.

Bar and food at the pool was mediocre, but the staff was friendly.  Any minuses were made up for by great service and lovely environment."}
{"text":"I stayed in a Valencia casita and it was cozy luxury, featuring a high bed, private patio, dramatic lighting, reliable temperature controls, intimate pool, Mediterranean meets southwest decor, and an overall boutique experience. Lovely!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST resort in Phoenix! My boyfriend took me here on 4th of July weekend to celebrate my birthday and he surprised me by proposing! BEST experience of my life!

For dinner we had a private room setup for us with rose petals, candles, soft music, and custom menus printed with my name! The service was EXCEPTIONAL. Robert was so friendly, helpful and informative. He recommended that we do a wine tasting to pair with our dinner, and it was a GREAT experience. T.Cook's has the most AMAZING food, I still dream about our dinner from that night. 

The grounds of the resort are manicured perfectly, and the staff is beyond friendly. I can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"We stayed at The Royal Palms Resort about a year ago.  The experience we had was top notch.  From the staff, to the food, to the other guests, we just couldn't have had a better time.  Recently we went back to Scottsdale and tried another place because it was where my work was.  We longed for The Royal Palms treatment which to us, was VIP.  So on our last night here recently we went back to T-Cook's and to our fortunate surprise, Eric, the Bar Manager was serving tonight... and as a bonus he remembered us from a year ago.  He makes the most superb Old Fashions and Manhattan's.  He knows his stuff.  I should have dropped a review a year ago, but I didn't and need to commend these guys for knowing how to give the ultimate customer experience."}
{"text":"A very lovely quaint historic resort nestled against Camelback in Scottsdale.  We were fortunate enough to be in a three room suite.  Each room had its own private outside patio complete with a fireplace and comfy chaise lounges to curl up in to read a book or enjoy a glass of wine. It was relaxing look out the French doors and see each of the three fireplaces lit 24/7.  Each bathroom had a private inside/outside shower.  Nice, well equipped gym and beautiful pool.

A couple of caveats:  We checked in on a major holiday and our room was not ready until 4PM.  

The restaurant T.Cooks had limited holiday hours. We booked the last possible reservation, 3PM.   Due to the late afternoon timing for our rooms to be ready, we had to clean up and change clothes in the spa.  We were traveling with our five kids and ended taking over the spa locker room with our suitcases.  We had an early morning flight to Phoenix that day.  Pretty disappointing to be inconvenienced this way after spending lots of $$$ on rooms and dining."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short because I can write so much.

Gorgeous resort and grounds.
Exceptional service and staff.
Great food at T.Cooke's.
Wonderful spa services at Alvadora.

I just came back from Royal Palms this past weekend and we had one of the best trips. Very romantic place for couples and at this time, Phoenix has really great weather. We absolutely loved this place."}
{"text":"I loved this boutique resort. I went in July so it was so hot but barely anyone there. We had the spa amenities to ourselves. :) The food was great! I didn't get tired of the T. Cooks menu. Would love to go back!"}
{"text":"Why would you go to a suburb for an expensive getaway?

I have stayed at the Phoenician and Royal Palms and both leave me baffled.

The Royal Palms is old.  It is right on the highway and the car noise is prevalent.  We got to the room and the best word I can use to describe it -- no, maybe two words -- battered and tired.  Chipped paint.  Sticky topped furniture.  Nicked paint everywhere.  And really, really dark.  

They moved us, and the new room is very nice, but also a massive accommodation to us and not close to our original price categrory of $500 per night.

Yes, as others have said, the grounds are lovely.  But it is still right next to a major thoroughfare, so very loud.  The pool is small.  So is the fitness center.  The shower has low pressure and the HVAC system is incredibly loud.

Our bed is sloped in the middle.  

The food is delicious.  The staff is extremely responsive and helpful.

I would not stay here again in its current state, but if it were upgraded, the food and grounds would make it returnable."}
{"text":"SPA Service:
By far the poorest service I've availed. It baffles me to read excellent reviews, buy the spa service, and then get ripped off.

I bought a lifetime gift certificate personally from the Holiday Desk 12/24/2011 and, was assured many a times that it would be enough to avail the Spa Service on presenation. So, I gifted it to a close friend who after taking the service (6/30) could not use the certificate as they refused to accept it. The folks at the front desk wanted a number to identify the gift certificate. And, obviously, there was none. So, my friend had to swipe in his credit card as a precaution till they could locate my Gift Card transaction. Next day, he had been charged in full and no one in the Accounting department picked up the phone. Now, it's been more than a week and, we are still not being put through to the manager in charge. We've disputed my friend's card transaction and, will continue the long painful follow up process to get our money back.

So, to the people thinking of buying a gift certificate - I'd think twice. 
And, if you still decide purchase a certificate, insist on a charge card or a Transaction Identifier or a Gift Receipt with a Transaction Identifier and, make sure your friends use up the gift ASAP.

Be Ware though !!

Hope no one else has this experience !!

{"text":"Got married here three years ago and now back from our anniversary and it's still as beautiful as ever. Mona and her team of personal concierge were amazing and helped us book out weekend! Even suggesting a hot air balloon ride, which I can't wait to do! Very private, got a great deal on a casita and everyone gives amazing service! The pool bar is the best! Try the hummus plate and the bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"Love catching dinner at TCooks. The food has always been great. Fun times hanging in the lounge area too."}
{"text":"Great hotel.  Reading the book about the history of this property made me appreciate the stay that much more.

As you have probably read, service is very friendly without having that forced feel that many places have.  The property is visually appealing with nice landscaping throughout.  It's very quiet and serene with a view of Camelback Mountain in the backdrop.

Nice pool and spa area

Rooms are very nice and much different from standard hotels, and i really liked the change.  The bed was very comfortable.

Location is good, and close to downtown Scottsdale.

Overall I would def rec coming here.  Not really for a bunch of dudes, but more like a romantic vacation kinda thing"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for a weekend getaway . Very nice rooms . Great restaurant and bar .Excellent service . Very accomindating . It's small in relation to the Fairmont Princess but much more intamate.Would go back in a second."}
{"text":"Second time staying at the Royal Palms Resort and Spa. From my first experience, I knew there was nowhere else to stay in the Phoenix area. First of all, the resort is absolutely breathtaking. This is not your average high end hotel, this is a beautiful resort filled with accommodating staff, guest services, amenities, and luxurious rooms.  And of course a fabulous restaurant/bar with an amazing chef and excellent menu.  The pool is also 5 star status, open 24 hours and food/beverage service is available certain hours. It is the ultimate in luxury. I have yet to experience the spa services, but I will hopefully indulge myself in them someday. The rooms feel like you are in a Tuscan villa. Every little details astounds you. We had very knowledgable and experienced waitstaff at the restaurant, Jeff and Miguel are amazing. Each staff member is enthusiastic and friendly. We invited a good friend from the area for dinner and she was so impressed her and her husband are booking  a romantic getaway here even though they live ten minutes away! They are also service animal friendly, and treat service dogs with extra care and respect. I will never stay anywhere else in this area. So glad I got to show my mom and friend the best of the best. This place is a cut above the rest."}
{"text":"What is the name of the management  who killed royal palms.
The lounge was a bore. The crypt. 
The last few year it was such a fun place to go but this new years dead. Who ever is running the bar fire them."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst manicures and pedicures I've ever gotten. Poor shape, rough edges, streaky/bubbly polish... And it took more than TWO hours! I will not be returning."}
{"text":"What an amazing couples resort!  The romance... the views... the staff... the attention to detail... This unique boutique hotel is a perfect getaway for a couple who wants to add a little romance to their life.  The hotel made every single square inch of this property special.  It's fun to wander around and be able to sit in one of the many public areas, but feel like you are all alone with your significant other.  You can even have dinner in one of their many secluded areas to make your evening a little extra special.  All staff members are are attentive to guest needs and there is no way you can check out of this hotel without being delighted with your experience and wanting to return."}
{"text":"I've never posted to Yelp before, but felt it's time to do so and post about my recent experience at the Spa there....
The Royal Palms hotel is wonderful, but the Alvadora Spa at the hotel is horrible, in my recent experience!  I really wouldn't rate this a 1, but there isn't a lower number.  There are only 2 toilets in the women's locker area, and 2 showers...so I had to wait in line each time I needed either. And the staff uses the toilets too!  Never did see anyone cleaning the showers or the toilets, which by the way, someone wasn't flushing!  And the 'quiet' area was used by staff as a short cut to pass through to the outside courtyard...one staff person had a conversation with the door open, and it was a cold AZ winter day! And then, I had to climb 2 flights of stairs to get to my massage room!  And, I'm in my 2nd day now of a pain in my neck from that massage.  I was given a 1/2 off TravelZoo voucher for this spa day, so I'm glad I didn't pay for it...other than $30 for the tip.  But the worst is, I ordered a pina colada, and the pool man automatically added 20% tip to the drink...making it a $15.00 pina colada (in a plastic throw away bar cup)!  I'll never go back, won't recommend this spa and will stick with Camelback (where the pina coladas are perfect!), Sanctuary, Phoenician and Montelucia...which all 4 are beyond wonderful.  Forget the spa at the Royal Palms, but stay at the hotel and eat at the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Pretty good massage, but the amernities were not nearly as good as it could be.

The locker room/private spa area is pretty small, with a strangely placed hot tub and only two chairs for resting/sunning yourself. 

After my massage I wanted to have lubch at the pool. Impossible! The pool is in a seperate area so you have to compete with everyone staying at the Royal Palm (not to mention some Scottsdale crowd locals) to get a space at the pool. I had to brave walking to the pool in my robe from the spa (sounds silly but it was annoying). Then 50  LOUD douchebags had taken over the entire pol area and were partying and giving others the once over. I was just trying to relax! Of course there weren't any chairs left at the pool, so eventually I gave up and wen home. Not very relaxing."}
{"text":"Oh dear Royal Palms Resort...can I please live here forever?  HAHA...this place is awesome!  My family and I have been going here since it opened...I remember this place when it was being built up...they have one of the best breakfasts, lunches and brunches ever!  They do not have as large of a selection as the Phoenician but it is delicious!  I love the green eggs and ham omelette!  YUMMY...it is an omelette with pesto, proscuitto, and parmesean!  They also have this gyro egg dish its awesome too!  My mom had her 40th bday here and we have had other large parties here too!  The hotel grounds are beautiful...it is much smaller then some of the resorts we have in the area but thats ok because they did an amazing job with the little space they have...the rooms are gorgeous and luxurious!  The pool area is small but its ok...whenever I have been there it is not crowded at all so I feel like I have my own pool...It is right against Camelback mountain so the views are beautiful...I have not gone to the spa yet...but I heard its great!  I need to save save save...hahaha...try this awesome resort you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Very cool place, even when it is 105 degrees.  Great rooms and services.  I highly recommend this resort hotel.  There are many niches and places to hang out.  If you want to treat yourself to something special and be treated well in a luxury hotel and spa, this is the place.  Great breakfast spot that oozes relaxation."}
{"text":"It is a bit over-priced, but the accommodations are very nice and relaxing.  The pool and fountains have nice, private seating and the staff is great.  You really forget you are in Scottsdale, the grounds have a relaxing life of their own.  The food options are very good and the spa was very nice and had a lot of options."}
{"text":"I am only reviewing the Restaurant and Bar area.  This place is perfect, they get everything right, the visit to Royal Palms for dinner was the highlight of my trip.

Reservations are met to perfection, the atmosphere is super classy without being over the top.  Service is top notch.  Food is great quality and fairly priced.

As I usually do, I will keep it short - GO HERE for drinks and a dinner date."}
{"text":"A very beautiful hotel in which my room was really spacious and well maintained. I quite liked the décor of the room and the way that the grounds were designed was gorgeous and it is definitely one of the most beautiful hotels if not the most beautiful in Phoenix / all of Arizona. 

There are some great restaurants nearby too which is great because I obviously don't want to have to go far to get something great to eat. The staff at the hotel were fantastic too, they were really friendly and helpful and it was a pleasure to stay at the hotel because of that it was it really nice to be a hotel that really cares about the people staying there and after all the price wasn't too bad either and I definitely think it was a good deal and I would definitely go there again because it was just awesome."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at the spa. First class service. I had Del and she has over 20 years experience and has worked at the Royal Palms for 14 years. AMAZING. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"OK.  So hubby and I stayed here last night and LOVED our overall experience and room.  I'll explain why they lost a star in a sec. From valet to check in to arriving at the cabana by the pool, we were welcomed with warm, friendly smiles and top notch service.  Cabana was well worth the $$ and made the day perfect!  I had a facial at the spa at noon that was amazing.  Food and drinks by the pool are very good.  Hats off to Sebastian.  All day Saturday he was the pool boss and did a FANTASTIC job!!  Everyone was prompt, very nice, and made the stay just lovely.  Our room was ready much earlier than we expected and it did not disapoint!  If you are staying here, splurge for the Spa Terrace room!  Pics will be added.  Comfy bed, lovely furnishings, and the private patio facing the garden was simply divine.  I want to point out how amazing the pillows were.  Like, my all-time favorite hotel pillow!!  

Here is where they lost a star from me: little, nit-picky stuff.  But at this price point, it's the little details that matter.  The shower in our room had a steam function...didnt work.  The water tempature was really off...cold then hot then cold...not a good shower experience.  The sink in the bar area of the room had a hot water dispenser that didnt work.  Finally, the custom toiletries were not very good.  The shampoo and conditioner felt cheap and made my hair really dry.  The lotion was mostly alcohol.  These are all very small items, but in my opinion are keeping this from being one of the top 2 or 3 hotels I've ever stayed at!  Everything else was THAT GOOD!  Hopefully they will fix these little things.  I do look forwarx to returning here on my next Phoenix visit."}
{"text":"If you ever forget what customer service is, go to Royal Palms and  you will be re-reminded of exactly what it is.
I had a massage at their Alvadora spa.
This was their summer special for $99, a 50 minute massage.  Simply first class. 
I could have been tarred and rolled in feathers and would have still felt pampered.
They are  consummate professionals yet genuine and friendly."}
{"text":"Nice hotel. 

Stayed here during a buy out event, and it was pretty good. The facilities are pretty nice - they have very well maintained grounds. The food was a mix of impressive and kind of boring. Service was really great, but be careful - one of those bar tenders serves super strong prickly pear drinks!!"}
{"text":"The place:  quite lovely, beautiful architecture; lovely gardens and flowers.  Nice rooms, nicely furnished.  
The staff:  friendly and accommodating.  
The spa:  Best and most professional (knew his stuff) reflexology that I've ever had at a hotel or resort.  Sorry that i can't recall his name.  I also booked a  private 1 hour stretch session, and it was perfect, just what i needed, and again by a talented professional.  
Minor shortcomings: Can't have (just) drinks outside in the shade part of the restaurant, have to use the bar.  Front desk all but promised us a casita for early check in, explaining that one had not been rented the night before and saying \"come anytime\" but also saying it wasn't 100% guaranteed. I would have expected them to make sure it was ready given our conversation, but it wasn't, and we did have to wait.  They said they would call us on our cell.  While we waited there was a staff turnover, and I guess one team did not update the other team, and they never called us.  Ultimately it was still ready a little early, and that was nice.  
Caveat for Casita 153: its private patio backs up against the housekeeping and engineering hut, and so there is a lot of coming and going by staff, and sometimes you hear their radios that they communicate with. Try to avoid this one. That's probably why it wasn't rented."}
{"text":"Last year, my husband and I brought some friends to the Royal Palms Mix Up bar for drinks and appetizers. The property was so beautiful- flowers and archways and cozy outdoor fire places everywhere- and our experience at the bar was so great, we decided to keep it on our list for future staycation. Yesterday, I brought my mom to the spa for a mother-daughter day. We left in silence- not a good sign after a day at the spa. 
To preface- I love spas. I like going early and try to make a whole day of it (yoga, steam rooms, lounging at the pool, etc). So I was really excited to try a new place out.
First, I was shocked at how small the spa was. My bedroom is about the size of the locker room. You could not have more than two people change in there. We walked in at the same time as three other women, and we had to awkwardly wait for one another to get dressed. So my mom and I put on our heavy spa robes, looked around, and realized there was really nothing we could do to \"spa\" besides the steam room. There are no fitness classes, the jacuzzi is outdoors (not happening in 115 degree weather), the women's only relaxation area is also outdoors, there is no sauna, cold plunge, nothing. So we put our robes back and went out to the hotel pool, where we hung out for two hours until our appointments. 
The waiters at the pool were the best part of the day. They were amazing. They were incredibly attentive and sweet. We ordered drinks ($15/each) and split a sandwich (~$13). The pool is very pretty but it was small (we were VERY close to the other guests in the pool) and dirty. The water almost seemed filmy and there were lots of little leaves and bugs in it. While at the pool, I overheard two people talking about their underwhelming spa appointments, so I quickly lowered my expectations. 
My massage was \"fine\"- my mom said her facial felt like a little massage on her face. There was nothing special to set it apart from any other massage or facial. 
Overall, it was just ok. The grounds are beautiful. I would go back for drinks and dinner, for sure. I think you could enjoy the massage more with nicer weather since several of the amenities were outdoors... but given the choice of resorts and spas we have here in Arizona, I have removed the Royal Palms from my staycation bucket list."}
{"text":"The bf and I needed some majoring pampering (or, I did, and dragged him along for the ride) and got a 90-minute couples massage.  It was a pretty decent experience, though I wish I could have been slightly closer to the bf.  He seemed like he was on the opposite side of the room which was counter-intuitive to the \"couples\" concept.  The facilities are decent, though small and slightly outdated.  It was odd how you have to pass through the steam room to get to the small soaking pool, and the temperature of the pool was too lukewarm to fully enjoy.  

I wasn't the biggest fan of my masseuse, either.  She was a little snappy for a masseuse (you want a calming, soothing person to be touching you, and sadly this wasn't entirely the case) and had some really painful techniques.  

Overall, however, for a couple's massage experience, it lived up to my expectations."}
{"text":"I am beyond disappointed with the customer service of this resort. We booked a room here as a staycation to celebrate our anniversary, and we were so excited to relax by the pool and be with each other. My fiancé received a call from the concierge the day before we arrived at 10:30am (a work day) and the voicemail simply said to call back. Considering we don't get done with work until late sometimes, we didn't end up being able to call back until about 7pm, and by that time he was gone. We thought nothing of it.

When we arrived to the resort the next morning, we were greeted with a very shrewd woman upon trying to check in who told us hat they overbooked their rooms for the weekend, and we didn't have a room anymore. No apology, no nothing. She just told us that they would move us to another hotel - an old hotel (not resort) in the middle of downtown that, let's just say, is not sitting at a 4.5 star rating on Yelp. I was upset by this and incredibly sad that we wouldn't be celebrating our anniversary the way we planned, so I told her that I was really disappointed by their customer service. She then chose to say \"we tried to call you yesterday and you never called back. So I don't know what to tell you.\"  Needless to say, we declined staying at the other hotel and got our money back.

And here's what really put the icing on the cake for me: I follow a few local AZ bloggers on Instagram, and what do you know, one of them got an all-expenses paid staycation at the Royal Palms the same weekend we were kicked out for over-booking! So they turned away a paying customer to have a blogger come and take pretty Instagram pictures. That's so wrong it's not even funny.

I hope management reads this review and understands the kind of repercussions these \"business decisions\" have on their customers. I will never stay here again, and beyond my review I'll make sure to tell everyone about my horrible experience."}
{"text":"Exterior of the hotel was amazing. I got \"lost\" on my way to the bar one evening and was pleasantly surprised to find so many secret hang out spots, fireplaces, fountains, and gardens. Such a beautiful oasis in the desert. 
Interior was okay. Felt a little dusty and bland to me. Beds were not super comfortable and shower pressure was low. However we had a private outdoor patio with a fireplace and it was exceptionally romantic and relaxing. 
Service overall was great, food was Okay. They ultimately had the same menu everywhere. The pool food was good- I had the poke (could have been more substantial), the burger (tasty), sundae (really good). At the bar/restaurant we had steaks (amazing), sliders (one of my favorites), cheese plate (overall good) and hummus (also really really good especially to share)."}
{"text":"Came here for a fun getaway with my hubby The setting is quaint and the valet service was great. The actual room and bedding/towels were something you might find at a motel 6. Definitely not worth the high price tag. Not to mention the fact that we woke up to a huge cockroach on our pillow this morning. When this was mentioned to the management - she said that this is AZ and these things happen - and offered a measly credit on the valet parking. No. I would not recommend it and definitely not going back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted a weekend getaway.  We found the Royal Palms Resort and gave it a try.  It was a little pricey, but it was well worth it for the atmosphere and experience.  We loved the Hacienda feel of the property and enjoyed the time at the pool.  No rowdy kids were to be seen and everyone was enjoying the sun and quiet.  The whole evening was quiet.

The room we stayed in was also amazing!  It consisted of a tile shower and shutters in front of the bath tub.  It was fun to get away for a weekend.  We even ate at TCooks restaurant.  The food was expensive but we enjoyed being pampered like royalty.  Oh and the drinks we just as great!

I would go back to the Royal Palms anytime.  Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely gorgeous. My girl and I are going to make it a tradition to visit at least once a year and hopefully stay for a weekend. Very quiet and secluded from much noise, even being on Camelback. The concierge is great and quick. The Valet is exceptional, definitely item deserved the tip. If you want to get away, or have a stay-cation, or just to simply spoil yourself come here. It's great."}
{"text":"Celebrating our personal endeavors at the Royal Palms Resort & Spa was the PERFECT choice!  

Our recent stay experience at this historical setting proved the spirit lives on. We felt like a celebrity from the amazing food at T. Cook's restaurant to the housekeeper's turndown service because every staff member really took ownership to enhance our experience. It's authenticity, come rain or shine (see the rainbow photo), confirms why this resort wins so many awards. 
 
If you want the royal treatment with an intimate atmosphere that blends into the base of the famous Camelback Mountain, we highly recommend this elegant resort. It's a dream come true!"}
{"text":"I spent the day at their spa and then got a 75 min massage. I don't splurge often and do spa days about once a year. Even though I have not been to many spas, I have to say, this is one of my favorites! I spent my time before my massage relaxing by the pool and drinking a couple of mixed drinks. The service was spot on coming by only when I looked up and the pool was nice and relaxing. I went on a Sunday and loved that it was not packed full of people. its not very relaxing when you have to be a vulture for a nice bed with shade, which I've experience in some previous spa days. The women's jacuzzi was private and quite lovely. it was outside, but the water was cool enough to relax in. And the massage was so soothing. With my nerves right now, this truly hit the spot."}
{"text":"Quiet, secluded, elegant, old Spanish, luxurious. Excellent restaurant and lounge with live music. Beautiful pool with cafe. Fantastic service at every level.  Perfect getaway. Five star hotel, but some real bargain prices available during July and August when it's inconceivably hot (temperatures were 110-ish on the weekend I was there)."}
{"text":"I have been here once on business travel and I knew I wanted to come back with my family one day. when I planed for our winter gateway in Phoenix Royal Palms came to my mind naturally. It's such a unique property. The beautiful timeless architecture style, friendly staff, and the tranquil vibe soothing you relax you. We would come back here in a heartbeat. 

By the way, Michael challenged our daughter to find all 7 crests scattered in the resort. Here they are, all seven!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely top-notch! My husband booked a surprise weekend for three year anniversary here, and we got to bring our little one and a half-year-old daughter with us. It's an amazing resort that's uniquely family-friendly and an intimate couples oasis. We had the opportunity to eat at the restaurant which is amazing! They gave us complementary desserts for anniversary, without us even asking. It was so cool! They have renovated their rooms and only three short years ago, it was just beautiful. Now the rooms are even more beautiful! We were served by the most amazing staff. Everyone was kind, accommodating, and professional. We had trouble seeing the TV set because it was set to an energy saver setting, and instead of second-guessing us, they just refunded us the movie. That was so classy! We didn't have to worry about anything. We had couples massages and pedicures in the spa. If you ever get a chance to use the spa, absolutely do it! I'm not going to tell you anymore because you simply must be surprised by the deliciousness of it all. A huge shout out and complement to our server Brian at breakfast and our server Sasha at dinner. All of the servers in the restaurant and all of the staff were just wonderful. My little toddler really enjoyed herself tooI feel like I'm not even using enough good words. We had our wedding here and having our third anniversary here was a dream come true!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just returned from a 4 night stay at The Royal Pams and we are huge fans. The grounds are beautiful and the employees are super friendly! I only gave this 4 stars because although the pool was gorgeous, it was really crowded and not nearly enough seating for all the guests. But, we still had a great time and the staff at the pool bar is exceptional. They are very accommodating and even come around to fill up every ones waters so you never have to go to the bar and ask for one. 

T Cooks was really good, more impressed with the breakfast than the dinner but dinner was still really good so I highly suggest making some time to dine there. 

The room was really nice, pretty standard size room but great bathroom and comfortable bed. 

I think that this hotel is in a great location - 2 miles from downtown Scottsdale, a few miles from Camelback and only a 2 hour drive to Sedona. I highly recommend this hotel for a long weekend/romantic getaway."}
{"text":"I picked the Royal Palm specifically because the reservations agent guaranteed a specific room that had a specific amenities in the room and was told \"beautiful mountain view on the second floor\".  I waited over an hour for \"my room \" to be ready.  Come to find out someone \"upgraded me to a different style room run requested and on the ground floor.  The room did not have the large spa tub I specifically requested.  I was moved to the right type of room with the tub but now my \" view\" is people waking right past the glass doors and can see everything and I get to people watch.  So much for the \"view \". Now I can soak in the tub and stare at the walls and closed blinds !!!!!   For the money you pay and for the way the staff kept reassuring me about this place and the reviews I am very upset  and not happy.  I picked this hotel over many other nice resorts because of the promise made to me.   I'm stuck, ruined my weekend plan and the hotel go their $$$$ for the room.  Some special.   Yes I'm spoiled, yes it may seem petty , but when you on this much for a room, and choose a place for a specific room type and view just to get \" sorry\" from the manager on duty is unacceptable.   It's not a motel 6.   For a resort at this level to do this kind of error is unacceptable.  I'm just in a room with a tub. Nothing special. Should have stayed at 4 seasons or Wild Horse. For what its worth."}
{"text":"This review is exclusively for the T Cook's (if it is part of T Cook's) lounge area only as we did not stay in the hotel. I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, however, we feel that people need to hear about the experience we had here. In summary, we would not return due to their poor customer service and have shared the following experience w/ our friends and family.  My husband thought it would be nice for us to go out and do something special before NYE to help us decide if we should spend NYE there. He did a whole lot of internet research and found that according to the website, the Lounge area of this hotel had flamenco entertainment once a month.  He called to verify and to see if we needed reservations, the woman who answered was quite nice, he said, and confirmed the start time of the entertainment. How fun, we thought! We dressed for the occasion and were very excited to go to this Lounge; we went wednesday december 28, 2011 and arrived at 6pm. The grounds are absolutely beautiful-we were even more excited as we were pointed towards the back area to The Lounge.  First off, we walked in, there was no hostess/host, no one to greet us- not knowing if we were in the right place, we looked around and at that time a waitress (or maybe the bus girl?) practically ran past us, clearly not wanting to be side tracked.  My husband asked her if this was the place where they had the flamenco entertainment and as she was walking away/running away, she said that there wasn't any flamenco there and pointed to the bar and told us to ask the \"bar supervisor\". My husband and I looked at each other wondering, huh? So we both walked over to the bar where there was a bartender and one of the waitresses, Kathryn and i think another bar person. We stood there waiting for them to agknowledge us, which they didn't, so after a few awkward seconds my  husband  asked them if this was the place, etc...Truly we felt like we were interrupting their conversation; we felt, at this point, very unwelcome and it hadn't even been 5 minutes since we arrived. We were pretty sure that we were in the wrong place and there's no flamenco entertainment here.  They all looked at each other to ask themselves, is there flamenco entertainment here? One said no, the other one had no idea and Kathryn the waitress said that they did but that it would be outside. All this while, no one was speaking to us, there were speaking amongst themselves. We found this to be extremely rude, impolite and uninviting. I think my husband asked if food was served there, Kathryn at this point said yes and informed us that there was also a restaurant down the hall (TCooks) that served food.  We felt pretty uninvited there, like she was shooing us away, actually now that i think about it, so we walked to TCooks and realized that we weren't in the mood for formal dining and returned grudgingly to The Lounge. We didn't get a 'welcome back' or any greeting that could turn the previous experience around but yet we decided to sit. The waitress Kathryn was dutifully pleasant while taking our order. The hors d'hoerves were good, but I have to mention this: when the \"bus girl'? I didn't get her name served us the food, not a word from her. My husband politely said, \"Thank you\" as she served us the food and still not a word back from her. She's the one that nearly ran us over -i noted her above. All in all,  I'm not sure what was going on w/ their service staff,  I really feel they just didn't want to be there and secondly,  they have been inadequately trained in providing excellent customer service.
Rude, impolite, unwelcoming and not knowledgeable about entertainment provided there. Definately not a place we will return to-that includes the resort.   We did not stay for the originally much anticipated flamenco entertainment which ended up being inside and not outside like were told-we felt too unwelcomed."}
{"text":"Beautiful grounds! Loved the unique feel of the compound, seeing the various flora, and beautiful orange trees and gardens and fountains

Wonderful service from the restaurant.

We stayed in a suite which was nice. 

Suggestions for improvement:
Water heat irregularity - every time I showered the water temperature wouldn't stay the same, fluctuating between hot and slightly cooler; very frustrating!
Thin ceilings - not sure if we just had perpetual stompers above us but every time they walked, the ceilings creaked and we heard EVERY footstep, making it hard for me (a light sleeper) to stay asleep
Furniture in the room - could use updating"}
{"text":"One of our all-time favorite restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area! Beautiful ambience! Sounds random, but their curried Brussels sprouts are the most amazing things I've ever tasted. We literally fly in from Dallas so we can eat Brussels sprouts, hahaha! I'm not even joking. Great staff, service and we love the hotel."}
{"text":"I'm having my wedding here, so I'm a fan. Courtney their catering manager is great. I'll update the listing after the big day!"}
{"text":"This was pretty much the first business I had the chance to experience when I came from CA to check out this city 
This hotel is a lover paradise. If you can afford few nights in one of their casita I believe you will share some happy stories with you grand children  about the time spent in paradise.
By the way the spa and restaurant are also institutional in the city."}
{"text":"Five stars.

The staff at the Royal Palms is so unbelievably helpful and courteous.  I'm not sure I'm the type you might expect to find at a resort like this, but I've never detected a whiff of attitude from anyone here.

Last year, I reserved a \"Royal Romance Package\" which included dinner and a room, complete with champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries.  Our room was a large casita at the corner of the property, resulting in a very quiet and private experience.  Walking around the resort, you feel like you're really (as lame as it sounds typing this) in an \"oasis in the desert.\"  The other guests have those silly, serene looks stuck to their faces.  The staff is always smiling.  Everything just seems so...leisurely.

Don't even get me started on T. Cook's.  The service and food are impeccable.  At first, the portions may seem a little smaller than you're used to, but the flavors more than make up for this.  I've eaten here a few times and the wait staff are always pleasant and conversational without intruding on our meal.

My fiance and I are currently planning our wedding here in the small, private Alegria garden.  The Royal Palms was the first and last place we toured; we just absolutely love this resort."}
{"text":"Royal Palms never disappoints.  My wife and I have been here a few times before and really enjoyed it.  It is the perfect place for a romantic getaway, to celebrate a special occasion, or a combination of those for a summer staycation, when the resort offers specials during low season.

We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and decided to stay overnight and enjoy the pool and spa, among other things.  Since we know we enjoyed the restaurant T. Cook's, I booked us on a Spa and Dine special, which includes credits at the Spa and T. Cook's.  I also paid extra for a romance package, which features chocolate-covered strawberries and champagne, and rose petals sprinkled on the bed at turndown (you can get them in a heart shape).  I requested the strawberries and champagne be delivered on arrival, with the rose petals around 7pm.

Check in is in an area not full of big formal desks but more of a cozy foyer with laptops.  Cool water, cookies, and even a glass of champagne awaited while checking in.  

One of the staff guided us to our casita, which had a king-sized bed, a patio out back, nice room-darkening drapes, a one-cup Keurig for tea or coffee (even decaf), a large bathroom with good-sized shower, a desk and chair and wi-fi, and a comfortable lounge chair with hassock.  It also had a Bose speaker with Bluetooth, so you could stream music from your phone to it and fill up the room (a nice way to create the right atmosphere).  While my wife was elsewhere, I called the front desk asking about the strawberries and champagne, and was told it would be coming right away.

After we changed to our bathing suits to go enjoy the pool, we waited almost 30 minutes (I told my wife there was a surprise), but no one showed up.  Finally, we just went to the pool.  We were able to find some chairs in the shade, and enjoyed the attendant who kept bringing cold water (he also takes drink and food orders).  While it is beautiful that the grounds and the pool are surrounded by many beautiful flowers, trees, and plants, some of those things float down and get in the chairs and pool.  But mostly it is like an oasis in the desert, combined with lots of birds.  It was relaxing around the pool, with piped in music varying from real relaxing to somewhat jazzy.

Some of the time my wife was in the pool I enjoyed the fitness center.  It is not large, but well-maintained, with plenty of free weights, a weight machine, and several pieces of cardio equipment.  I was the only person there the whole time.

It's fun walking the grounds with fountains in different places and lots of little nooks to sit and get out of the sun.  At night, the Tuscan-looking courtyard adjacent to some fountains is a great place to eat.  Since we had a larger brunch, we had a meat and cheese platter at that location.  I also checked at the front desk to make sure we got our romance package.

Upon return to the room, a woman from housekeeping came and delivered the food and drink, and the bed got decorated later.  My wife was thrilled with it all and it made for a very romantic evening.  

As the romance package wasn't delivered as requested, management was nice enough to comp me the cost of it without me asking.  And possibly because of that hiccup, the night manager informed me that we would have the use of a pool cabana free of charge the following day, which is quite a treat.  (And normally expensive).

The next day we picked a cabana that was mostly in the shade, and enjoyed a little fridge that contained complimentary soft drinks and a few beers.  You also can get a complimentary order of guacamole and chips.  I enjoyed chilling out in the shade while my wife floated around in the pool on a float.

We also went to the spa to get a couple's massage.  They have several rooms inside and out to relax in before and after treatments, and also to lock up your belongings.  The massage was very good, including a choice of scented lotions.  It is a lot more expensive than standalone spas, but in line with what you'd expect at a hotel or cruiseship.

I would definitely recommend Royal Palms as it has a very special personality, even though it is now owned by Hyatt.  You don't feel like it's part of a big chain. It's great to find some peace and is a great oasis in the desert.  I'll be back.  Hope to see you there."}
{"text":"Very nice and a great deal. Gal pals and myself flew in for a birthday weekend. 

Conveniently located pretty close to the airport. Also, running down to the shops in Scottsdale--we're right down the street. 

Feels like a home away from home. The service is very kind and accommodating. When they help you out, it feels really sincere. Pool guy, bell hop, valet, everybody.

On Friday and Saturday night though, there were weddings. So I got roped from areas that I would've liked to sit at. 

My first time to Phoenix and was pretty happy."}
{"text":"This hotel is BEAUTIFUL!  It's quite large, but definitely has more of a quaint, intimate feel.  The rooms are gorgeous and clean.  We attended a wedding here and the set up could not have been more beautiful.  I would definitely recommend as a venue.  Additionally, the employees who were working the wedding were extremely friendly and professional.  Everyone was more than happy to stop and answer questions or speak to us when we needed something."}
{"text":"The grounds are beautiful, and the room was pretty.  But it was a mess.  The dresser was falling apart, the sealant around the door was coming off, the phones didn't work, and worst of all there were both live and dead bugs all over the bathroom floor.  They had housekeeping clean them up, but then they returned.  And I'm not talking like 2-3; it was more like 50.  And they didn't offer to take anything off the bill.  It was treated very ho-humly.  Terrible customer service.  And bugs.  Lots of them."}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel. The grounds and amenities are gorgeous. So much fun walking around. The restaurant is top notch and the staff are super friendly. I had a wonderful experience at the spa. I can't wait to return"}
{"text":"Yes the place is pretty but....

My sister gave me a visit for my birthday. I have mentioned a few times that I would like to try TCooks, is that the right name? Anyway she misunderstood me and reserved a room for me and my mate.  So we went, yeah it is pretty, the grounds are nice, the staff well ok I guess. They of course could not find the reservation even though my sister had already paid and I have the confirmation number. So we sat in the lobby area for a bout an hour and a half while they figured it out. Finally they sent us on to our room with a lead. He showed us the room and asked if we needed anything. Nope was our reply. The room was nice if one is in to the look, I guess many from the mid-west are. The room was small as was the bath. There was no space outside for sitting other than a chair next to the room beside us. Yes it was nice, but only to a point. That point dropped when I found out how much she paid for this room, I almost pooped my pants. I am accustomed to paying silly prices for rooms as I like nice. But my God my home is much nicer than this hotel and a whole lot more room. I have no idea what she was thinking, but I am happy she thought so much of me. So yeah if you are coming from an area where this look is not over done, it is a nice place to stay. But I would still be disappointed with the room considering the cost."}
{"text":"The Royal Palms has always been one of my favorite places to go in the Valley. I love their gorgeous, peaceful surroundings, and the food is always phenomenal. Growing up, we came here for almost every Easter brunch and it was incredible every time. 

The other night, I popped in to The Mix Up Bar with two girlfriends to have a drink (ok, a few drinks) and some munchies. I ordered the Aviation which is gin, maraschino liqueur, lemon juice, and creme de violet. It was so yum! For munchies, we ordered the guacamole and a caprese flatbread. Both delicious and the portions sizes were great. 

They have a Happy Hour menu from 3-6:30 which I highly recommend because their drinks and munchies can be pricey! They also have daily specials like Taco Tuesday, Local Love Wednesdays, Bourbon and Burgers Thursdays, and live music Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. 

I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Simply fantastic. It would be a task to find a better place to stay in Phoenix. There's other nice places I'm sure, but I don't think I'm going to even try looking.  This will be our go to hotel in Phoenix.

The only thing I don't like is fees, but that is with any hotel. You can expect to pay about $70 per night if you park a car overnight here. 

Loved everything about this place. The little casitas is what we chose, and I think worth the extra cost."}
{"text":"Came here for a family celebration for Friday/Saturday night stay. All the staff was great and quite friendly. It truly felt like a dream over the weekend. We stayed at one of the Valencia Casitas. Luckily enough, everyone was placed in the same court yard, making it easy to get in contact with everyone. The rooms were absolutely spectacular. Huge king sized bed with a room that was beautifully furnished with a working fireplace. The bathroom was huge, lots of area to get ready. In the room, a book about the history of the resort was available with all the spectacular pictures of each type of room. 

Compared to the picture in the history book, the renovation of the bar looks great. We stopped by on our first night and had a few drinks. We are from Las Vegas, so to say that bar looked great.... is a great compliment. We also had lunch and breakfast at T Cook's. The service we got was great each time. The sever remember we were here for an 80th birthday, so each time, he brought out a complimentary desert tray. 

Overall, I had a fantastic time. I wish I could still be there right now and I hope I will be able to visit within the next couple of months again."}
{"text":"My very favorite hotel in Phoenix. It's borderline Scottsdale actually. Quaint yet sophisticated, the hotel is a former residence turned clubhouse for a 9- hole golf course, which is long gone.  The hotel expanded, built a beautiful spa and large pool, along with a great restaurant called T. Cooks. Try to get a Casita on the west side of the property. I stayed recently in the Spa Hacienda, which had 2 queen beds and a big sitting area, outdoor patio with fireplace, and a wet bar. It was next to the pool, but still private. Great service!"}
{"text":"This review is for Alvadora - the spa at the Royal Palms. [cue angelic voices...**ahhhhhh**] 

The lovely presented me with a spa gift cert for three services. When I arranged the appointment, I asked if I could increase the massage time from 60 to 90 minutes in lieu of the second service and was told 'of course'. So I booked a 90 minute stone massage and a pedicure. 

The day of the appointment - my birthday - I was greeted with a 'happy birthday' and shown to the women's shower/changing/steam room. Its not fair to call it a locker room, its simply too lovely for that. There is a second 'relaxation room' where you can sip tea an enjoy small bites while you wait. Delightful.

As for the massage itself, may I just say that it was the most relaxing 90 minutes of my life?? It was one of those times where time goes by much more quickly than you want. I didn't want it to end. The room has a vaulted ceiling with what look to be the original beams. It has two tables and shower heads above each for the citrus scrubs [yikes did that sound sexy...] The woman [you can ask for gender preference if you like] who worked on me - Carol, I think - was great. I was kept warm the whole time either by her hands holding the smooth warm stones or by the perfect weight of the covers over the rest of me. I felt perfectly taken care of. My 5x operated shoulders have never felt so relaxed. I walked out of there and into the ahhhhmaaaazing not-locker room [stocked with everything - and I do mean everything - you might need, right down to qtips, shave cream and disposable razors] where an out of town guest asked me what I had done and she told me I looked stoned. All of that without drugs!! The showers, walk in and large enough for a family of 5, are similarly equipped with all of the spa products to use and enjoy. Lovely. 

As an aside, I don't mean to short-change the pedi but I am a girl who has frequent pedi's, so this was less of a treat than the massage which I'm less likely to get for myself. It was pleasant, in a nice atmosphere but nothing seriously out of the ordinary. And sorry my lovely, but not worth 80+ dollars. 

There are nooks outdoors - each with lounge chairs and fireplaces - where you can relax and unwind further. Or you can have lunch there with your book - which I did. Menu, lunch, it all comes to you quickly, sweetly, happily. Makes me wish I lived there. Its quiet and lovely and is a great match to the experience itself. The staff is kind and attentive and a dot on the i of the incredible experience."}
{"text":"Just returned from a pre-Thanksgiving,pre-family get together where my 
Husband surprised me and  booked us into the resort for some alone birthday r&r. I can't believe our good fortune to arrive at this oasis mid week and fine a staff that doted on our every need or want. The check-in area sets the mood for what is to come...plush desk area with a fabulous fire and beverages along with an upgrade(small snafu on the part of Kayak)..during our three days at the resort we never encountered anyone who was less than a true hospitality professional. Grounds and pool area are emaculate.   the rooms. Well,let's just say the balcony,soaking tub and high end linens just start the long list of amenities. We had dinner at t.cooks ,the on site restaurant and that equaled the rest of the faculty. Top quality food and service,worth every penny or pennies!if your looking for no unpleasant surprises and spending your money at a place that really does appreciate you being there,then I would book a few nights here. Compared to other high end hotels or boutique places we've been lucky to experience Royal Palms is in our top three...ever! Oh, you won't even miss shopping  Scottsdale to hang out here all day and night.

{"text":"I have stayed here since 1999 and I think it just gets better every time we come in to town. Service is top notch, the food is excellent and the rooms of course are beautiful with a great view. Nice quality mattresses, linens, and amenities. The service is comparable to the Beverly Hills Hotel. An example is: we asked about a restaurant and they brought reviews to us; and when we decided to dine there, they made reservations and printed a map. Everything was waiting in an envelope when we went to get our car for the evening. We are treated so well, weather we are in a smaller summer discount room or a suite in March for spring training. The employees of The Royal Palms Inn will go out of there way to assist you to the best of their ability, we did not hear \"no\" with out a very valid reason; and they came up with alternatives. I highly recommend this place to relax and be pampered."}
{"text":"Came here for a weekend getaway from LA. The grounds are really beautiful, albeit a bit rustic in comparison to some of the more typical, modern luxury hotels most people usually stay at. Stayed in a suite which was great and very spacious. The staff are all very friendly and helpful!

One star off because the breakfast at T. Cook's is very average. And because the steam room in the Spa was pretty cold. The massage I got was amazing, but when you go into a steam room and the tiles are cold and the water dripping from the condensation on the ceiling is also cold...that's not ideal.

Overall would recommend though! Just go out for breakfast. :)"}
{"text":"Oh Royal Palms, how I love thee so!!!

We were just at RP this past weekend and thoroughly enjoyed this place.  Situated close to the Camelback mountains, when you enter through the gates you feel as if you are entering a Spanish mansion.  From the moment you pull up, the valet team are all over you making sure you and your luggage are properly taken care of.

Every single soul that I met who worked here was exceptional, courteous and went above and beyond.  I was quickly checked in and given all of the information that I needed.  Afterwards, the bell man/valet come to escort you to your room with a quick overview of the property.  After walking me to my Terrace Casita Room, he did everything from lay out my suitcase to fill my ice bucket.  The best thing about their wonderful service is that all of the tipping (except restaurant & spa) is included with the resort fee ($30 per day).  

The room (210) was marvelous!  We enjoyed the soaking tub that was so deep, I kept slipping under water =) as well as the huge shower, comfy king sized bed and our nice little patio.  We had a chance to take a swim in the pool as well and while there were several people out, it wasn't too crowded just yet.  I love their turn-down service (when do they even come in?!?), the yummy candies and bottled water they leave bedside and the concierge.  We booked last minute reservations through Mona at a swank French restaurant (separate review) and had no issues.  We were even given a complimentary glass of champagne as thanks to her sending us over. 

I genuinely loved just about everything here.  The grounds are quiet and well appointed and the hotel is close to some great shopping and fine-dining.  

If I had to fuss it would be to say that our toilet in our bathroom kept running.  After a couple of jiggles of the handle it was all fine so no real complaints there.  We also went to T. Cooks Lounge around 10pm one night but was a little disappointed that we missed the live entertainment for the night.  The food and drinks there were just okay and we ended up sending one item back (smoked brie).  The drinks were a little watery but our bartender was super nice.

I cannot wait to plan another trip here once the weather cools down a bit.  This would also be a nice place to head to once all of the kiddies are back in school."}
{"text":"I stayed here for a conference. My diamond stud earrings went missing from the time my husband checked out to the time the room was cleaned. (He had seen them and forgot to grab them.) Estimated time of two hours in which the earrings were left unattended.
He texted me when I was in the conference when he remembered seeing the earrings and notified security. The security person was cooperative and searched to no avail.
I sat in the lobby for the Phoenix police. I asked for a comment card. I was told a survey would be emailed to me.  No one from management met me. I am told that the employees are longstanding and have a lot to lose meaning their job if they stole the earrings. I asked if they polygraph employees. It is the police's decision apparently.
My biggest disappointment is that no one from the staff reached out. At least four employees knew of my situation, did not say my name or offer a sentence stating they were sorry about the situation. It was though I was the problem although I had not accused anyone of anything. I have to file a report for insurance. 
One star goes to the security officer. He was professional, sensitive and empathetic to my situation."}
{"text":"We stayed here last month and enjoyed our stay.  The room was comfortable and included a fireplace and a nice patio.  I took my yoga mat outside of the patio and did a little yoga on the lawn outside our room.  The next day I enjoyed a one-on-one yoga class in the secret garden...such a relaxing and lovely way to practice yoga.  The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was nicely equipped too.  The Royal Palms is not my favorite Valley resort, but it is a nice escape for a boutique experience."}
{"text":"They Royal Palms ruined our wedding night.  We arrived at 11pm, excited for what we thought would be a luxurious, relaxing two day stay.  When we were shown to our room, we realized it was not the room we had booked two months in advance; it did not have a soaking tub, the rose-petal turndown, or its own private patio.  

Naturally, my brand-new husband and I contacted the front desk; there wasn't a manager on site.  The man we were speaking too was unprofessional, informing us the room we had booked was not available and that ours was an \"upgrade\".  (How he could say that when the room was lacking amenities, I don't know.)  My husband was firm and eventually they said they'd put us in the Presidential Suite, but we'd have to move out of the room the next morning.

It was getting late and we acquiesced, and by midnight were finally in another room.  Unfortunately we had lost the luxury of being able to enjoy the night and sleep in since we had to move out in the morning.  We checked out, and had to wait until 3pm until the room we'd actually ordered was unoccupied and ready.

Do not trust the Royal Palms if you want a relaxing, special occasion stay.  It swiftly earned the name \"Royal Pain\" for the terrible wedding night experience it gave us."}
{"text":"Great Weekend.  Halibut was the best meal.  If you get a mani and pedi request Kathy she is the best nail tech with AWESOME stories to keep you entertained.  

Valet and Bell hops are great.  All appt requests were met with intended time.  

Staff was great.  

The birds by the pool....not so much :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel grounds, staff were all nice & friendly. Feels like your in Spain with all the Spanish influenced architecture. The resort has lots of corner spots & little nooks with water or fire pits. The pool is heated & open 24/7. I would definitely come back...great location as well. This hotel is situated on Camelback Rd & has an awesome view of Camelback Mountain."}
{"text":"Had a lovely weekend stay at this place. Service was great! The Mix up bar was great! The pool was great! Well worth it and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely exquisite and gorgeous!  Beautiful grounds and ambiance, fabulous food and staff.  It was a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"i feel so cliche giving another five! we just got back from a five day stay at the Royal Palms and it was just fantastic. there were only two small gripes:

1. the little cubby hole in the shower to put your shampoo in is at an angle and everything slides out
2. there's no iPod connector in the room- a bummer since they were just remodeled

honestly, everything else was amazing. the rooms, the pool, the grounds, the spa, the food and most of all the service. the cabana boys at the pool were totally friendly day in and day out- no matter what you were asking of them or how busy they were. anything you asked was answered with a smile and \"You got it!\" 

and here's the kicker: tipping was all included on the front end. So they weren't even doing it to get a big tip! 

at night, the grounds are dotted with little fire pits and couches where you can sit, sip wine and chat. there are also free pilates and yoga classes, and hammocks and croquet set ups around the grounds.

we couldn't have asked for anything more. i know it's in phoenix which is not always the most exciting place, but i'm telling you, this is a very nice destination resort for a conference, wedding or just chilling with a spouse or girlfriends."}
{"text":"Best Hotel in the Valley... very expensive but when i have done comps it was actually cheaper then sanctuary... the staff is top notch and they enter your preferences in their computer system so when you come back they remember what you like."}
{"text":"Ugh! This place is magic! I went there for my birthday for a spa day and what thought would just be a 50 minute massage turned into an evening of complete bliss. I walked around the area (which is just calming and beautiful - all you hear are birds chirping and the little water falls) and had dinner and drinks at their bar. I actually think I'll try to make this a frequent place to relax. I'm only not giving it a 5 star because of their rates, I got my deal from Groupon but if it's a day of splurging I definitely definitely recommend !!"}
{"text":"Basically amazing! The food, rooms and ambience is just fantastic! Staff is friendly and helpful. It's a must if you are visiting AZ!"}
{"text":"When we decided to go to Phoenix for the weekend, my boyfriend and I agreed we didn't want a big time resort. We decided on Royal Palms and it did not disappoint. 
This resort just gives off that warm cozy feel...the decor, the service...we arrived late on Friday night and entering the reception area, were scented candles and a cozy fireplace. 
Our room, it was nice, spacious, great bathtub...but it felt a bit like a cave (heavy drapery and a small window)! Definitely request a room with a terrace or balcony with a view. 
The concierge, Mona, was fabulous!! She was such a help and the 3 restaurants that she suggested for us, definitely delivered!! 
The pool area was nice and the service was very accommodating and friendly. 
The spa was also very nice...small but quaint, nice. I enjoyed a massage was nice. 
The fitness area seemed very small, I didn't use the facility...Mona informed me of the canal, that was just a mile down the way that I ran to and along. 
The location was also great, it felt centrally located and easy to get around. 
I would definitely stay here again, and recommend it for a weekend getaway, a nice alternative to the 'over the top' massive resorts..."}
{"text":"Beautiful resort with a European feel. Had one of the best massages ever at their spa. Room service was consistently delicious! Comfy beds and great location."}
{"text":"My wife and I were able to enjoy two nights at the Royal Palm Resort, on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

Relaxing, romantic, and secluded. The rooms are unique and intimate. If you are looking for grand spaces...it's not going to be the place for you.  If you are looking for intimacy and luxury...it's all good."}
{"text":"The Royal Palms is easily the most magical and memorable hotel I've stayed at, anywhere in the world. The Spanish Revival architecture, lush gardens, colorful tiles ascending the stairwells, and labyrinthine walkways combine to form a palatial, magical realism aesthetic resembling something Gabriel Garcia Marquez might have dreamt up. 

A [gothic fiction] summary of the stay:

The bellhop greets you by name. You haven't checked in to your room yet, and this is your first time staying at the hotel. \"Welcome back!\" they say.

You follow the warm, seductive aroma of poppies to your casita. The door is ajar. You enter and instinctively sit on the leather armchair, as though you have done so a thousand times before.

You walk to the fountain courtyard. You start to walk back to your casita, but suddenly, you're in a courtyard again. It's the same courtyard you were in a moment ago, but the fountain is gone. And the trees have moved. There is no courtyard. A grackle squawks for crumbs.

You stumble upon the pool area. You see the same guests you saw yesterday. Their smiles comfort you until you remember that you just checked in today. The guests wave at you in unison.

You wander around for awhile. You're going in circles, but the landscaping keeps changing. You hear a voice whisper \"turn left.\" There's no right turn, and when you try to turn around, you're against a wall that wasn't there before.

You arrive home. You receive an e-mail from The Royal Palms: \"We look forward to your upcoming stay!\" You search for your suitcase, which you were holding a second ago. It's outside, next to the street curb. A black car pulls up. The passenger door is already open, and the scent of poppies wafts in the air. You get in, abidingly, and return to the airport. 

I may still be in a trance :)"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a quiet and relaxing getaway! The hotel grounds are beautiful, rustic, and romantic - you almost feel like you're in Tuscany! The service is top-notch and they treat you so well! We spent some time at the pool, where the staff never let your water get empty and passed out frozen grapes and samples of some of their signature drinks. Chelsea and Steven made sure everyone was taken care of and having a great time! The rooms were nice with had high-end products and the bed was very comfortable. Overall, the hotel is intimate and best suited for a romantic getaway."}
{"text":"Rooms are so beautiful and the grounds offer great romantic walks. The bed is so comfy. I wanted to take that bad boy home. Little benches and reading areas. 24/7 pool and hot tub 

Cons: 

Checkin slow waited over 10 minutes before someone even said hello. When I booked no mention of 30 a NIGHT resort fee.  Supervisor on sift could Cate less spoke with GM and she waved but ONLY after walking her through booking and proving wasn't mentioned. I would stay again on a special date but with such a high resort fee too high too stay a week for vacation."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the Alvadora Spa...and even more so for Mariah who gave me the most incredible facial I have ever had in my entire life. Ladies and gents - if I were you I would definitely take advantage of the $99 summer promotion and treat yourself to a truly rejuvenating experience. I've had a number of facials in my life but I've never had an aesthetician actually stay in the room while the masks were drying and give upper back, cranial, arm and hand massages nor have I ever had luxuriously warm rehydrating hand mitts during the process of a facial. My skin has a new, refreshed glow to boot. This is the pinnacle of facials - I will never go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Wow.  What a beautiful oasis.  The property and buildings are quite unique with numerous outdoor and indoor fireplaces they keep lit, pools, fountains, walkways, outdoor socializing and eating areas, etc.  Perfect for a romantic getaway or a wedding.  

The rooms are also very impressive with deluxe bedding mattresses- not like your typical Marriott or Hilton beds but much nicer.  Extremely supportive but also comfortable.  Large tub with separate shower.  

The service was also impeccable."}
{"text":"This might very well be my favorite resort in the whole land.  

When you first turn onto the driveway lined with tall palm trees, approaching the Royal Palms serene entrance with the mountains looming in the background, you realize that this isn't any ordinary place to stay. Instantaneously, bags were retrieved from the vehicle and you're inside and helped in a jiffy. Yes, you're in Phoenix, yet somehow you're worlds away from it all. 

The room was serene and beautiful. The color scheme and accents had a Mediterranean influence, exotic yet familiar and calming. The room is spacious. The bed is comfortable. The bathroom is exquisite. A separate shower with perfect water pressure. A separate toilet. And a most excellent deep-soaking bathtub. And I stayed in an estate room. I can't imagine how glorious the estate suites, villas, or casitas are. 

The property itself is magnificent. The main courtyard with its center fountain, its Mediterranean style accented by palm trees and flowers and the mountains in the background is stunning. The grounds are lush and green and there are so many built in tranquil spots, both hidden and unhidden, where you can relax. The main pool is large, with adequate and comfortable seating. There isn't a spot within the Royal Palms that isn't scenic or relaxing. 

Service is top-notch. You get the sense that they will do anything to make your stay more comfortable. 

And if you really did not want to leave the property - no one would fault you for this - there is an amazing on site restaurant, T. Cook's. One of the best white-cloth dinners I've had in recent memory was at T. Cook's. Do you miss the Duck a L'Orange, it is ridiculously tasty. 

There are only good and great things to say about the Royal Palms. It is always considered one of the best in the area, if not the country. I can't argue with that. This place is absolutely amazing. If you can't manage to relax and unwind here, there is something seriously wrong with you :)"}
{"text":"My 2 star rating is considering that this is a 5 star hotel and should be held to high standards. There are many amazing things about the hotel, the grounds are amazing and the staff is good.  A few issues:
1) While at the pool for over 3 hours I was never approached by the wait staff.  There was a girl walking around but she avoided me completely.
2) The parking garage looks like and smells like a dump.  A 5 star hotel should keep up all areas where guest view.  They store old furnishings down there and there is a bad sewage smell.
3) They charge 20 dollars to park your car. This just seems like greed considering you are already paying upwards of 500 for the room, 30 resort fee not to mention room service, t-cooks spa, do you really need an additional 20 to park your car in a smelly garage?
Fix these issues and I will up my rating."}
{"text":"The resort is absolutely breathtaking, quiet and relaxing. The pool is gorgeous, the rooms clean, delicious food, and staff that went above and beyond to help us enjoy our stay. We can not wait to get back here."}
{"text":"This review is for the lounge that is part of this gorgeous hotel that boasts outstanding vistas along with a lush tropical feel to it.  My wife wanted to check this place out for happy hour. I'm glad we did; The food is excellent. They have $2 steak tacos on Tuesdays. Although they are relatively tiny, they were very tasty. We had the short rib flat bread for $7. Which is not what you are thinking when you hear the word flat bread. It's more like a tortilla in which you dish in the short rib meat (no bones) and lather it with this heavenly goat cheese. I could have eat that cheese all night. In addition, we had the pretzel bread bites that came with dipping cheese. The first few pretzels I dipped with the cheese but then I realized that I still had goat cheese left. Think of a bagel lathered with cream cheese. That's what I did with the goat cheese and pretzel bread. Our total tab came to $18 (included one soda) before tip.

Needless to say, this place is very intimate and classy and very affordable for the regular folks.  And I might add that all of the employees are professional and helpful."}
{"text":"I've been in many presidential suites, few better than the one here.
Everything is superb.
Attention to detail, focused and sharp.
And the room itself?
Romantic with it's outdoor showers, making you feel almost naughty when showering.
And room service?
I enjoyed the eggs benedict, although it was somewhat cold.

Too bad I onlly have until till two o'clock to get this room cleaned and ready for shift manager inspection."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon and joined friends for a day.  Wouldnt say the facial was worth 130 which included tip (20%).  Dont like suggestive selling, and the front desk was a bit disorganized.  Spa was mediocre at best- small and on top if that the sauna was out of order.  Property is nice and service by the pool was good.  Drinks weak and food subpar.  Would not do it again as the experience overall was a decent 2 star out of 5."}
{"text":"The Royal Palms is royalty in the resort spotlight!  Only a few years ago, this beautiful location was slowly deteriorating into a mess of chipped paint, ancient tiles, and broken fountains.  With the refurbishment of the past few years, the Royal Palms has sprung up as though from a fountain of youth, while still keeping its wonderful, old-school charm.  
If you decide to stay, be warned that prices are over two times the price in the winter.  If you want to catch a break, go during the heat of the summer.  The rooms are frosty cool, and the gigantic showers and tubs are perfect for two!  Each casita was designed by a different interior decorator, and the main buildings are beautiful as well.
The crowning jewel of the Royal Palms is the SPA.  Oh my.  This place is absolutely luscious!  Be prepared for a pricey, but totally worth it, experience.  My husband and I had several treatments one weekend and all were performed in the duet room, which has soaring wood beamed ceilings, a fireplace, and a totally private outdoor shower with a waterfall spigot.  Our masseuses were very professional and discreet, and the entire experience left us both relaxed and happy.
In the words of Ferris Bueller:  If you have the means, I seriously recommend it."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this resort and upon arrival, we were greeted by super friendly guys at valet (which is complimentary for the entire stay). We got a deal on travel zoo for a one night stay in a casita, two cocktails, a $25 food credit and and $50 spa credit. 
The resort grounds are truly beautiful. You almost forget you're in Phoenix; all the plants and flowers are so lush and green. The room was cozy with a large 4 poster bed. The room had a Kuerig machine which was nice to have, even though we didn't get a chance to use it. The shower was large and the room was really clean. 
The resort is a destination earth property and very Eco conscious which I liked. The resort also includes a daily resort fee so that way you don't feel obligated to tip at every turn.  All the staff were extremely polite. 
The only issues I had was with the spa and room service. The $50 spa credit could only be used on a 50 minute service. I really wanted a pedicure and we were gonna pay out of pocket for a second pedicure so we could do it like a couples treatment but it wasn't an option. Also, it was 40+ for breakfast for the equivalent of a Denny's grand slam breakfast and it didn't come with any juice or anything just water.
 The resort fee does allow you access to the fitness center, pool, hot tub and into the spa to use the showers and eucalyptus steam room which was so refreshing and relaxing."}
{"text":"An oasis in the desert. You are treated wonderfully from the minute you drive up. The staff totally caters to your needs to provide a comfortable stay. Sitting by the pool they brought ice water without being requested but they'll also bring other drinks. I love the mature landscape and all of the different places to sit and relax outside. The inside could use a little remodel. The beds are comfortable and the A/C is cold and quiet. We slept well and enjoyed our time there."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for good service and this is tops! 

Everyone, bellman, valet, pool guy, front desk, housekeeping. I think really good service people should anticipate what you want, so that you don't have to ask and they do a great job here.   I left the do not disturb sign up while we went to lunch and the desk left us a message to ask if we still wanted our room cleaned, and it was cleaned spotless in the hour and a half we were at the pool.  The pool people are great, make sure you have ice water filled (it's the desert you need to stay hydrated), will move umbrellas for you, whatevs.   The pool is a bit small but it's really relaxing.  They play this sorta flamenco guitar music everywhere which could be annoying to some, but i think it's sorta funny cause I had it in my head all week.   The grounds are beautiful, relaxing, and quiet.  
 The valets were great, and I love that they seemed so genuinely appreciative for tips, and not like they were expecting them at all.  There is a  25 dollars a night resort fee that's includes some tips, grounds fee, valet whatever, but I still feel like I have to tip that's just me.  House keeping was great too, the kept not taking our tips and we'd have to chase them down and tip them.   As for T. Cooks I only had breakfast here which was good nothing to amazing but good solid and well priced 12-14 dollars.  The lobby has  this really good FREE arnold palmer that they put grenadine in and the ice tea has a bit of orange in it.  It's like crack.  

I guess the minus would be the pool being small, and the steam room smelled a little funky."}
{"text":"What a gem
Staff was amazing and skilled in the fine art of customer service. My wife and I are locals that wanted a staycation sans kids and to celebrate my wifes bday. I booked on Hotels.com and called the resort to confirm. Nina was awesome and asked if we were celebrating a special occasion. Some reviaewers mentioned the snooty attitudes of the valet staff and tcooksstaff. We had no such issues at all. They were all wonderful and if you tried to tip valet they reminded you about the resort fee an no tip policy. After a pleasant happy hour at t cooks with excellent service we retired to our room only to discover a clean room and chocolates for my wife. 
We will be coming back."}
{"text":"The best and most intimate resort in Phoenix. Stayed here for my wedding night so of course this is a special place fore but believe me we had many places to choose from. The rooms are beautiful, grounds are intimate and well kept and the staff will go above and beyond to meet your needs. I have not gone to the spa personally yet, but purchased a massage for my mom for Mother's Day and she loved it."}
{"text":"The experience lives up to the expectation set in its name. I was lucky enough to have my wedding at the Royal Palms and must say that the experience from start to finish was spectacular. Set against the backdrop of Camelback Mountain, the setting is simply stunning. We had our wedding reception in the Estrella Room with the cocktail hour in the courtyard in front of the room. 

Before getting married here, I was told by anyone I spoke to that the wedding food is by far the best they've ever had anywhere else. I completely agree with this statement. The food is a culinary masterpiece. It doesn't taste like your typical catered food. It tastes like the food they serve in T Cooks, if not better! Everything you eat, down to the bread and pesto dip is extraordinary.  

The service is about as extraordinary as the food. I worked with Suzanne who was extremely helpful from start to finish. Each bride and groom gets a \"shadow\" for the wedding day. Our shadow was the fabulous Christy and followed us around while we took pictures and throughout the whole night and made sure we had cocktails, food and any other help throughout the night. She even helped me in the bathroom with my large wedding dress! I can't say enough about Christy and how helpful she was throughout the night. She was calm, comforting and helpful throughout the whole night. 

I will end this review by saying that \"you get what you pay for\" and while the Royal Palms is on the pricier end, it's worth every penny and they make sure they work for their money. Everyone is kind and helpful and I couldn't imagine getting married anywhere else.

Besides the wedding experience, I was also lucky enough to stay at the Royal Palms the night before and the night of the wedding. I highly recommend staying in the Valencia Casita #125. It's got an adorable courtyard, little sitting area, a small kitchen and a nicely sized bedroom. The rooms are intimate and have a lot of character. The grounds are extremely relaxing and lovely to just walk around and take in. 

I have also been a guest at their spa and must say that it's a relaxing and luxurious experience! The staff is friendly, the amenities are very nice and everything is completely relaxing."}
{"text":"This is my second time at scottsdale. This time I stay with Royal Palms Resort for couple night. I love this Hotel Coz they have a Nice Restaurant ,Nice Spa ,Nice swimming pool open 24hr and also really Nice service. This place it's not too far from big shopping Mall in town. I really wanna recommend for a tourist if you looking for Nice Hotel to stay. let's thinking about this. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Spent 4 days at the resort. Very relaxing. Great food. Everyone friendly.  Very nice clean rooms.  Easy checking.  Housekeeping was great.  Lobby was clean. Will return if in AZ again."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful, secluded, intimate resort, timeless but cozy, packed full of charm and old European sophistication.  One of the most romantic get aways in Phoenix.   Great food and a quite sanctuary that is conveniently located!  Can't go wrong, whether it is a romantic dinner or a weekend retreat!"}
{"text":"One of the best resorts around.  Romantic, hidden and tucked away.  Staff is very accomodating and the casitas are spaced far away enough from each other that the patios do feel really private.  Depending on the time of year, you can get a decent price on a room.  The pool area is smallish compared to newer resorts but have been nicely rennovated."}
{"text":"I loved this spa. I really like their private line of grooming products. My massage was great and very relaxing. I truly like their adjustable massage tables. I did not care for how small the lockers area was but likely not an issue on a slow day. Pool area was nice but didnt like that they added service charge on my drink ticket as I almost tipped twice. Overall I eould go back but Montelucia around the corner would get my $ first."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Royal Palms for one night (was supposed to stay 5). The property itself was beautiful. Decorated nicely for Christmas. The staff (valet Brandon and front desk clerk) were excellent - very professional and kind. Both gave a nice overview of the property and amenities. The room itself, however,  felt worn out. The carpet was in bad shape. The bed was too high to climb into, the bathtub was odd (also couldn't get into that) and you have to consider all of the extra charges. All in all I spent $350 for one night's stay (you are charged if you leave early). The property is iconic though, the staff was nice and the grounds were beautiful."}
{"text":"Great resort in many ways. Be careful with the rooms. We had a \"designer casita\" which was less than a Motel Six\" room in many ways. Our kids got a wonderful room for less money. Management really doesn't care what you think. Because it is an old resort there are many, many rooms from awful to wonderful. No way to tell what you might get."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 4 stars over three except for one thing: The walls and floors of this place are too thin, and you can hear your neighbors big time. At 4am, the guy above me was pacing and pacing, and I could clearly hear this guy walking around (like I was living in a New York City Apartment).  After this guy finally fell asleep, around 4:30am, these two women in the adjoining room, and I could totally hear them. They weren't screaming or being overly loud; they were just having a normal volume conversation. I had to put my ear plugs in to go back to sleep.

Other than that, it's a very nice resort with a great grounds and room. The restaurant (which I did not go to) is T. Cook's, which is one of the best restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area by reputation.  Other than the noise thing, I had a very nice stay here."}
{"text":"This resort is beautiful.  I had the best massage I've ever experience by Bri.  She was so professional and I will definitely go back to see her.  Steven was our server at the pool and was also excellent.  He had a great sense of humor and make awesome menu suggestions.  The whole day was a delightful experience."}
{"text":"What an amazing place!!  I had an incredibly enjoyable time staying at the Royal Palms Resort, and recommend it highly.  So many excellent points:  absolutely gorgeous accommodations, polite and helpful staff, excellent restaurant (breakfast/ brunch outside, with a delicious cup of coffee, is a must), a great spa, and a relaxing atmosphere.  My boyfriend and I stayed here for a conference in late October, which is a great season in Arizona.  Our stay was a pleasure from beginning to end.  The resort is well-suited for special occasions (there was a wedding reception and an outdoor conference dinner during our stay).  Our room was very comfortable, with excellent set-up and a great view of the mountains from the balcony.  The resort includes a pool, a small gym, several lounge areas with firepits and fireplaces, and the wonderful Alvadora spa (with massages, facials, outdoor-facing showers, and shaded lounge areas to your heart's content).  There are several mountain trails a short walk/ drive away from the resort, and downtown Scottsdale is 10-15 minutes away by car.  In all, a beautiful place for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"This resort is beautiful and has that romantic feel to it. The beautiful mountains, palm trees, nice lighting, and wonderful architecture on the grounds makes for a magical stay.

The rooms are nice and feel like a fancy house. You feel like you are in an expensive home rather than a resort room. Also when you walk out everything is so beautiful and doesn't have a typical resort feel. The vibes you feel here are very good and cozy.

The pool area is very nice, this is a place that doesn't cater to kids. It's very adult oriented which is a great thing since often resorts can be too wild with kids.

This is a beautiful place that you should check out if you want something different from a hotel or want a more intimate resort. They have that magic here!"}
{"text":"Beautiful grounds, great rooms and the restaurant is excellent!!! It's our favorite place for brunch. The room we stayed at was great and the bed was so damn comfortable that  we woke up in the middle of the night to comment on how comfortable the bed was!!

The spa was OK, unfortunately my therapist kept talking and talking and talking and I was a wuss (yeah, I know...) and didn't told him to please just....shut up! 
The pool area is tiny, so if you're interested in more of a pool scene, this is not the place.

4.5 but I'll round up because of the best bed ever!!"}
{"text":"The Royal Palms Has Lost Its Sparkle :(  I am a local and hold a Spa membership and also frequent T. Cooks and The Mix Up Bar. The last few visits have been disappointing to say the least. Most recently I had a dispute with the billing department regarding the billing of my monthly membership fees. After first trying to reach the Spa directly with no avail. I was caught up in the voicemail system never being able to connect to the spa to speak to someone. I then called the front desk , where I eventually spoke to the Guest Services Manager, Nate. I explained to him the issue and immediately he was attentive and accommodating. He went far beyond the call of customer service and resolved the issue , personally with professionalism and genuine care and concern. I am really writing this review for Nate. He is a credit to The Royal Palms and deserves recognition for his service. Thanks Again Nate:) Your a Rockstar ***"}
{"text":"love, love, love. From the moment we got out of our car - the entire staff was amazing. The pool side bar and staff are fantastic, they went way out of their way to make sure we were not sunburned - drinks were perfect. The spa treatments are top shelf and the employees at the spa were kind and warm."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar only - it's our 'go-to' place to unwind on any given night... 

Tonight happened to be a rare Friday evening where my fiance and I were ready to get our swig on. Royal Palms bar took good care of us... fantastic bartenders, fun company on either side of us, great wine, delicious food (especially the bread with pesto sauce), and Dwight on the piano with a vocalist.  Jared had a simple turkey sandwich with some sort of salami and a side of salad.  I went with the bronzini fish that was served with some vegetables - different than what I expected but very good.  In the past, I've gone with their burger and it's ahhhmazing!  

One of these days we will actually spend the night at the Royal Palms, but until then, it's a treat to just go for several drinks, a meal, a cup of coffee, and a slow drive home."}
{"text":"Sadly, the Royal Palms has all the beauty and bones to be a five star resort, but none of the customer service or special touches that make it so. We stayed for three nights during a November weekend as part of a wedding block and were just so disappointed by the overall feel of the place with one bigger problem that was just not met with any amount of concern from the management. Our biggest specific concern was that the heating/cooling system in our room did not work for the majority of our stay and the first night we slept/didn't sleep in an 80+ degree room with hot air uncontrollably blowing all night long, where you cannot open a single window to the cool November air. It seemed like such a tease to have cool air outside! We discussed with another wedding group member that she had the same exact problem, so clearly this was not an isolated problem. We brought it up to management three separate times and were met with neither a solution or a fair explanation. Ultimately we felt that we were not fairly compensated for completely losing out an entire nights comfort in a not inexpensive hotel room. This is not a complaint about the softness of the linens or the light fixtures in the rooms we're talking about. This is basic creature comforts. You can usually get working air conditioning in the Motel 6. I found this unacceptable and completely not on par with a five star hotel experience, let alone a three star hotel experience. There were smaller things that were noted by us that we felt were just a bit \"odd\" about the rooms-very dark lighting/inadequate if you are a woman trying to put on makeup or get ready for an event, dark carpeting, very thin walls/can hear neighbors making even quiet noises, and a sewage-y smell from our bathroom every once in awhile. 
I understand that this hotel recently underwent ownership change/management change under Hyatt hotels, and I am not sure if this is to account for the lack of attention to detail and large problems left unsettled. I also understand that this property originates from a historic citrus plantation, and that is cool and all, but the rooms have to stay up to the 21st century hotel standards if you are advertising it as such. I'm not sure which of these reasons or if either of them are to explain anything that occurred during our stay.
The pluses of this hotel are the stunning, well maintained grounds, as well as the pool area and the service at the pool area, and the Mix Up Bar, which I should probably write a separate review for because it was so good. 
Not even taking into account other family members even bigger problems, and the fact that I just don't have a whole lot of reason to return to Phoenix any time soon, I would definitely not stay here again or recommend it to anyone else looking for a five star hotel experience."}
{"text":"This is beyond the most incredible resort I have ever stayed at. Can't wait to come back! I went here for a quick staycation over the weekend for my anniversary and I couldn't ask for anything more special. The beauty of the resort and the service I received from every single staff member was Incredible! 

Check in is normally at 4pm but I called that morning and the staff was very kind over the phone and found an available room so we were able to check-in at 12pm. All parking is valet so you pull up, and the bell hops will help unload your car and direct you to check in desk. The staff was so nice checking us in and then even greeted us with a fresh glass of champagne. Our bell hop walked us to our room and even explained a little history about the resort. Like it used to be a home in 1922. 

The rooms are large and beautiful. We had a huge soaker tub and a large double shower head walk in shower. We also had a free Keurig in the room and a private patio. My favorite part was the bed! It was so fluffy and felt like a cloud! Best sleep of my life! They do a turn down service at night so they come in and turn down bed sheets, give chocolates, and close the curtains so your ready for bed. We received a gift of chocolate covered strawberries and champagne for our anniversary when we got back to the room. Such a romantic evening. 

This is a very beautiful historic Spanish style resort so very little kids which is nice for a special romantic occasion. There is multiple courtyards that all look different so it's gorgeous to just walk all the pathways and explore. Beautiful lit up at night. There is benches, tables, games, waterfalls, and fruit trees all over the property. Great large pool and jacuzzi which is open 24-7 so you can go anytime at night when it's less busy. They do have a great poolside bar and it's pretty packed during the day. 

Check-out was at 12pm but they are very accommodating so just a quick call down to front office they let us know we can check out at 1pm which allowed us more time to relax in the morning. We ordered breakfast in bed of pancakes and a fried egg sandwich which were both amazing! 

Overall everything from start to finish was amazing. Such a beautiful resort to stay at for a romantic evening and the staff made our stay so special. I'm very excited to come back, if not sooner, at least for our anniversary next year. Next time I want to try the famous T Cooks restaurant on property that I herd great things from. 

Thank you Hyatt and royal palms for making our anniversary so special!"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful resort! My parents stayed here over the weekend so we popped over a few times to visit them & check it out. The staff were friendly & very helpful when we had any questions. The rooms are beautiful & pretty spacious. The bathroom is stocked with great products from their spa.

The pool isn't large like other resorts in the area, but it's extremely relaxing & peaceful.

Thanks to my parents, we'll be back to try T. Cook's restaurant soon!"}
{"text":"What a treat!

This beautiful resort and spa sits just below Camelback Mountain in Scottsdale. The setting is a tranquil and serene compound of architectural excellence that combines Spanish colonial, hacienda and Mediterranean effects, lush gardens, fountains and courtyards. The accommodations are rustically elegant but well appointed with features such as a nice widescreen TV, fast in-room wifi, a fireplace, a Keurig coffee maker and a sitting area in the patio just outside the room. I can't comment on the value as a friend paid for it. But even if it was $500/night, it would still be worth the splurge. The staff is very friendly and helpful without being over bearing. I didn't take advantage of the spa or swimming pool but if you just want to spend a couple of days being pampered and relaxing with great views of Camelback, this is your place."}
{"text":"This resort is all about service...they really tske care of you! The property itself has such deep history, read the coffee table book about the history of the resort. The breakfast was amazing and so was our dinner at T.Cooks! Do you want to wind down? Just off busy bustling Camelback, you can't help but wind down and relax. Try the Spa as they do it better than most! I recommend this resort!"}
{"text":"This was our 7 year wedding anniversary and we had  very high hopes of having a wonderful time. The grounds themselves are gorgeous, and the hotel is kept up very well.

The problem lied in the staff. When we came back from breakfast, our room was being cleaned with the French doors propped open by the housekeeper's cleaning cart. There is a specific sign that says to please not leave the doors open because bugs get in, and indeed they did as we had both dead and live bugs including a baby lizard!

While at the pool, my husband went up to ask for our tab as we wanted to leave, and the server was apparently having a terrible day. He lit up my husband about what a terribly run place this bar is, and how they were out of everything, computers down, & a litany of profanity in expressing his dismay at having to work there! We could not believe this, and were taken aback.

We asked that are covers be turned down on our final evening there, as there were yellow stains on the comforter. While it seems that the sheets were changed, the same yellow stains were on the comforter after they cleaned the room.

There were other issues, I won't bore you with the details, we did make the front desk aware of the entire list and she did deduct $75 off of our stay of 3 nights, but that didn't make up for the ridiculous charges and abuse we endured while being there. The parking charge of $15 per day is also absurd, especially since we took other means of transportation everywhere we went during our stay.

While the grounds are beautiful, I would appreciate going to a place that is was not as unprofessional as they were here, including some snide remarks made by the valets, in an attempt to be funny. 

I fully expected management to call me the next day after my list of gripes, however our business was apparently not important enough for them to do so. I also suspect that the front desk person did not even convey these to management, which we did ask to speak to before we left, but were told she was not in.

There are plenty of other gorgeous resorts in Paradise Valley and Scottsdale who will receive our business in the future."}
{"text":"Chose to stay here for our staycation/mini moon this past weekend and boy was it the best decision ever! From the moment we reached the premise we were met with top notch service, we made our way to check in and we're greeted with friendly warm faces and 2 glasses of champagne, we were then taken to our upgraded room where then sent up a bottle of champagne and the most delectable chocolate covered strawberries!! All in all we can't wait to spend our yearly anniversaries at this beautiful and amazing hotel!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to stay here for a mom and daughter weekend for my 30th birthday. The grounds are very pretty.

When we got to our room since it was later we decided to watch a movie but the remote wasn't working so we called the front desk to see if we could get some help. 30 minutes went by and no had shown up so we called again and the girl claimed she had no idea about it and we waited another 30 minutes for someone to come and push a button to reconnect the remote. 

The next day we had a spa day planned and first I had a facial.. The girl I had doing mine was rather snotty about my normal routine and pushed me to change the things I did in my every day life bc my face was too dry (keep in mind I had a dermatologist appt the next day and they told me my face was fine).. So not a fun experience with the facial. Than I had a body scrub which was super nice and a massage from the same girl and she was great! 

Than I had a blow dry and the woman was so rough on my head it almost made me cry when she shampooed my head. She almost drenched my face and blamed the sprayer than she put me under a dryer so my hair would dry faster because she had broken her arm and still couldn't use it very well and she accepted taking another client in between to cut his hair. Not okay!! Than when she went to go blow dry my hair she kept pointing the hair dryer on my scalp burning me! And she did a zig zag part (very 90s and out of date) claiming it was her signature as well as curling my ends making me look like a 10 year old! 

Overall I'd say the whole spa experience really was not worth it. It did not have very many other amenities beside the services you were get like other spas and all the services provided were not the greatest! 

Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Absolutely breathtaking resort and very romantic. This place has live music during hh and their hh menu is delicious along with their restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Nice grounds, adequate room.   Very expensive.  Good bar.   Not sure its worth the money as there are equally fine options for less money in the vicinity."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to stay at!  My family and I stayed here for a weekend a while back and we all had a great time.  Everyone was so friendly and went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable as possible.  The property is beautiful and the gardens are great for a stroll.  We loved the fantastic view of Camelback mountain from their heated pool.  Our room was spacious and clean.  I can't wait to come back to this place the next time I'm in Scotsdale."}
{"text":"I have stayed in a lot of the best hotels in Phoenix and I am more neutral on the Royal Palms more because I think they do some things well like the check-in process and other things are a bit substandard like the Mix-Up Bar which feels dark and too sleepy when compared to places like the Thirsty Camel at the Phoenician.  We had one drink and then moved on. 

My wife felt that the spa could use some extra touches like razors, hair products, lotion, etc.  She felt that it lacked the personal things one would expect from a high end resort.  She did however like the massage and was pleased there.

Visually, the grounds are beautiful and there is a lot of history.  The room was nice and well put together.  

The worst part of this hotel was the late night room service.  It's bad enough that they have 4 menu items but the night clerk was woefully undertrained in Customer Service.  No follow up, rude and in general seemed \"put out,\" when she called to confirm the order.

To the credit of the resort, they comped the food.  They did double charge us for the room which is a human error and they acknowledged the accounting was done incorrectly.  They didn't correct the charges until 10 days later.  

I just felt that the trip in general was incomplete and I had high expectations for this hotel."}
{"text":"I stopped in on one of my recent resort pool hops and might have found my new go to pool. The pool is small and crowded, but the large blue chair towels, poured water in a large container and service made up for it. I was greeted as I entered the pool area and treated kindly through out my stay. I ate a chicken quesadilla at the bar that was \"to die for\". Yum that was good! I ate the whole thing, even in my bikini. I ordered a long island iced tea, but was given a Mai tai, with an apology and \"I'll make you a long island iced tea after you finish that, if you want\" from the bar tender. 

I paid my bill and included a tip, but  it wasn't until after wards that I noticed the tip was already included. Nothing was said to me so I guess they figured I wanted to tip twice...hmmm."}
{"text":"Beginning NOW! They have a live Jazz Band on the courtyard playing that is out of this world great. Steven P is the vocalist-Producer-songwriter that is there now. Nice evenings there on Thursday! 
Nice staff and great fun. Sexy surroundings."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous.  I haven't stayed in the rooms, but have dined in T. Cooks many times and have attended several functions in the banquet rooms.  It's always a great experience.

From the moment you arrive at Valet to the end of your event, the customer service here is awesome.  The banquet staff always goes over and above to make sure you're well taken care of.  At one particular breakfast meeting there wasn't any ice water available in the pre-breakfast area.  Instead of telling me \"there's water inside\", they went in and got a fresh glass for me.  At another meeting, I asked for a Lime for a Diet Coke I was drinking....they walked to the bar inside the building to slice up a fresh Lime for me, very cool.

Whenever there's an event here, we try our best to attend because we know it will be over the top.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"All I can say is... when I die, I hope Heaven is the Royal Palms with endless amounts of Malibu Rum and trips to the Alvadora Spa :)

Their spa is by far the best in the metro-Phoenix area. Attendants and masseuses give five-star service is, time and time again, the single best hour of my life when I get to splurge and visit them. But worth every bloody penny!

The grounds are pristine and an oasis in the Phoenix desertopia. Secluded south of the Camelback Mountains, you'd be amazed at how removed you are from the 3+ million people in the area. It's just that fabulous. 

The staff and valets are always accommodating and rarely have I ever saw or heard them get snooty as a few have complained about. 

The pool and bar is a must visit :) Especially during the eight months of summer in the Valley. The only downer... sometimes they just don't have enough loungers. But they quickly remedy that upon request."}
{"text":"First of all let me preface this by saying we have eaten here before for breakfast and it was one of the best breakfast we ever had!

So for my mom's 90th birthday, I thought this would be the ideal place to take her for a very special dinner.  Although the setting and the service was excellent, the food was a big let down.  I had the bison and it showed up absolutely stone cold. The reason I didn't send it back was that I didn't want to spoil my mom's dinner because I'm  sitting there without any food.   We all know how uncomfortable that can be!  And I found out later that both my mom and better half thought their fish had way too much salt on it.  

the only reason I didn't give them one star is due to the beautiful setting and staff friendliness."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! We had gone for our wedding anniversary, and I had booked the room through one of those travel websites, and if you do that regularly you now that your room is going to be just a room nothing special.  So as we are checking in to the hotel, the front desk clerk informs us that our room isn't ready, and that we had been upgraded to casita. I knew from our last stay here those rooms aren't cheap, but when he said that I was jumping for joy inside!

The room was sooooo wonderful we didn't want to leave the next day!"}
{"text":"When I think Royal Palms, I think romantic getaway. A quaint yet exquisite resort, the Royal Palms was built in 1929 to emulate a colonial Spanish retreat. Colonial as in when the Spaniards were conquering the New World.  All of the historical details are presented on a frescoed wall in one of the courtyards.  

We had heard some great things about J Cook's and decided to spend a leisurely Sunday morning dining on the patio. If you're looking to be treated like royalty, you want to dine here

I enjoyed exploring the hotel after a luxe breakfast at J.Cooks.  The staff are incredibly accomodating.  What an ideal location for an intimate stay-cation!  It's a nice place to go to grab some drinks and appetizers, I will definitely be back to see what more the resort has to offer!"}
{"text":"An ultra high end resort perfect for a weekend escape.

The more we travel, especially for leisure, the more my wife and I gravitate toward smaller, more intimate and unique properties and the Royal Palms was exactly what we were hoping for.

We booked a \"designer casita\" which featured a comfy 4-poster bed, beautiful gas fireplace (turns on with a remote), large bathroom with a massive walk-in shower, a totally private walled courtyard in back and two large wing chairs.  Normally a fireplace wouldn't make much sense in warm and sunny AZ but we were unlucky to have two solid days of rain during our late February visit so the cozy fireplace was on a lot-not for heat, but ambience.

While we weren't able to enjoy lounging by the pool, we did spent some time exercising in the modest fitness center (mostly tread mills with a few free weights and a couple of weight machines) and even sat in the bubbling outdoor hot tub in the light rain. One afternoon we had a drink in the cozy hotel bar as well which was a nice relaxing spot.

Besides the very beautiful grounds featuring artful touches throughout, one of the standout features of this property is the strong service culture.  

Parking is Valet only but we never waited more than a minute for our car and there was always plenty of cheerful staff waiting to retrieve the car. Another plus is that tipping is ALREADY INCLUDED in the $31 daily resort fee so no need to travel with a pocketful of ones.  In addition our greeting at checkin was fast, efficient and friendly and we even were given a glass of sparkling wine.  One of the bellmen/valet took us on a brief walking tour of the compact property before guiding us to our nearby room.

While I wish we could have spent some time soaking up the sunshine, our visit at Royal Palms was restful, quiet and peaceful at this outstanding property.

Can't wait to return but hoping for better weather!"}
{"text":"Royal Palms - such memories!  My wedding reception was at Royal Palms almost 10 years ago...if I could have Yelped then it would have definitely been 5 Stars.  Have stayed many times over the years and have always enjoyed returning to this special place...I would classify all as 4-5 star caliber visits.  The property remains beautiful and the location can't be beat.  Most recently returned for my wife's birthday this past weekend.  It was once again a terrific weekend, but there's clearly room for improvement.

Pro:
1. Beautiful property - perfect location
2. Great room (designer casita #118)
3. Good service
4. \"Surprise\" birthday dessert in room was a nice touch

Con:
1. Time to jazz up the pool area: one poor server running around like a chicken sans head does not make for a relaxing environment...and the little shack of a bar does not exude opulence.  Try to be more like a miniature version of the Scottsdale Four Seasons Pool area.
2. T'Cookes has not recaptured it's mojo from the glory years gone by - good service and food, but it used to be head and shoulders above typical resort fare.  (this could be another review if I had time).  
3. They ran out of souvineer coffee mugs - this in and of itself is no big deal, in fact they gave us a token discount on a set removed from a room.  This would have been much more appreciated if we didn't find coffee residue in the mugs when we got home.  Not the end of the world, but annoying nevertheless.  
4. $25 \"Resort Fee\" is irritating.  These nickel-dime charges and fees everywhere you turn these days are really getting out-of-control.  I'd rather pay the advertised price and take care of my own tips and such.  

Overall, I'd say 3.5...rounding down in this case.

**************************
8/24: Updating from original 3 star level.  After reflecting on all the hapiness that Royal Palms has brought into my life, I just can't leave this as 3 stars.  The place deserves four...kind of like a lifetime achievement award.  I wrote the original review the day after consuming 4 lemon drops by the RP pool, a Boodles martini and an Anchor Steam at the Jade bar, wine and Irish Coffee at dinner at T'Cooks, a bottle of Champagne in the room, and a bloody mary and another anchor steam at brunch the next morning at Dick's Hideaway.  My liver may have weighed in with 3 stars, but the resort really deserves 4."}
{"text":"We just came back to NY after a stay at the resort. At first when we booked the resort, we had high expectations and it looked wonderful from the website photos.  When we checked in on 10/31/17 in the evening, the front desk alerted us that they were going to give us a new room because the original one was near a high traffic area.  We were fine with that, when we arrived to the new room and realized that our originally requested mini-fridge was nowhere to be found, we called the desk and the gentleman said that it is underneath the TV, which was a mini-bar.  They saw it was their mistake and had maintainence bring it over from the original room.  We also noticed that a hair dryer was missing, they promised and agreed to bring one over and none was brought over in the five days we were here.  I eventually caught a head cold on my final day of our stay. Not to mention, the room was musty, dark, and had a odor.  This property needs a major uplift and overhaul.  I would not stay here again when we come back out to Arizona in the summer."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite resorts.  It's a hidden gem and you could literally drive right by it and miss out on amazing experience.

If you're like me and love the Spanish style look with red-tiled roofs, outdoor fireplaces, lime-washed stucco walls, ancient pavers and antique fountains with a touch of Old World decor...I know a mouthful... you need to come here.

Upscale clientele and an amazing place for a wedding, honeymoon or romantic getaway the Royal Palms Resort resonates the epitome of historic charm and class that can only be appreciated by old school Phoenicians and snowbirds.

As soon as you drive by the iron gates a gorgeous fountain and brick courtyard welcomes you into an old dreamy Mexican style hacienda.  Adorned with original works of art, European and Mexican finishes, warm terra cotta colors and Spanish accents this 1920s boutique hotel is casual and offers a walk back in time.

My husband and I love coming here for dinner at TJ Cooks restaurant. I promise you will enjoy amazing dishes like pork tenderloin, butternut squash ravioli, Chilean sea bass, grilled lamb...duck...and the service? First class of course.  Our date nights always included a cocktail in the lounge-a dark low-ceiling cozy place with little niches and rooms to sit by the fire and listen to live piano music.

I love this place so much-it will always be favorite first stop when in Phoenix. Don't miss!"}
{"text":"I am currently still at the Royal Palms so please stay tuned for any updates both here and on Tripadvisor/Google. 

We booked a 5 night stay for our Babymoon. I emailed prior to coming for a Casita close to the pool and also asked if the pool was cleaned often. I was assured both were true. We also asked for early check in.

Upon arrival we were forced to wait for a check in...it was fine until we realized that my 8month body would have to be so far from the pool - that request was not met.

Every day we have been to the pool around 1pm and every day the pool is DISGUSTING but today was the absolute worst. There is a thin film on top and bugs everywhere. For it to be such a small pool it is insane they don't have someone clean it more often.

We have received great service at T. Cooks and at the Cabana Cafe - the people who work here have been wonderful. It is really sad that part of the reason we booked the babymoon was so that I could enjoy the comforts of the pool - a clean pool and we were assured it was cleaned daily. I can assure you it is not.

Maybe it is cleaned in higher seasons but the bugs and the film are pretty rancid.

Plus side is the air conditioning in our room works and the employees are very nice. The rooms are definitely dated and when paying for a Casita you would think a \"semi private terrace\" would actually be semi private. Ours is not. It's actually a huge courtyard we share with several other rooms. Not a terrace at all. 

I am seriously disappointed and so sad we chose this as our place to have our last trip before the baby. For the price you would think they would at least offer us bottles of water (I am a Hyatt member and most Hyatt's do this) - They do not. Water is $5 a bottle...the coffee maker in the room has never been cleaned and is disgusting. Coffee is $5 a cup. 

Being pregnant and miserable - we could have done better at home. it is clear they do not care about their guests at this time of year and that this was once a decent resort. Unfortunately - I would steer clear.

One last thing of Note that is VERY important - we had this booked for months - NO ONE ever contacted us to let us know that both T. Cooks and the Mix Up Bar would be undergoing renovation. They are impossible to find every day because the signage is so bad and tehre is no true \"bar\" to hang out in. If you are considering booking this place before July 28th - be warned - They don't care to let you know until check in that these places are vastly different."}
{"text":"Amazing.  I did not stay at the hotel , but I did visit the Alvadora spa.  This spa was very warm and inviting.  I liked the fact that it was indoor and outdoor, with plenty of natural sunlight.  I used the eucalyptus steam room, and private outdoor jacuzzi prior to my treatments.  I enjoyed that these facilities were separated from the men's facilities.  The treatment room was lovely, with floor to ceiling plantation shutters that offered just enough light.  Sometimes I feel like I am in a cave when getting a massage, so this was a welcome change.  The therapist, Jennifer, was an absolute delight.  Knowledgable, professional, and a great conversation.  She did both my massage and facial.  She gave me wonderful tips on skincare, and even taught me an exercise to stretch my back after a long day at work.  The rest of the staff was very pleasant and accommodating as well.  The products used were animal, and environmentally friendly.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Rarely do I give out five stars for hotels, but there you have it. A resort perfect in every way. My husband and I booked our stay for one night last Tuesday on the day of through the Hotel Tonight app. $100 for the room... truly a steal. There was an extra $30 resort fee tacked on that all guests must pay, and which pays gratuity for the valets and housekeepers, gives you access to the pool and fitness center, etc. The pool, by the way, is open 24 hours, which was so cool because we are such night owls and we totally had the pool all to ourselves at 1 in the morning. The pool also has floating rafts you can use for free, plus clean towels, comfy lounge chairs, cabanas, and bar service. The pool did not disappoint.

The customer service was phenomenal. The woman who checked us in was very chipper and seemed genuinely happy to have us there, and one of the valets gave us the tour of the resort and showed us to our room. He was very helpful and kind.

The room was decorated lovely, and although we had hoped for a king bed, we made do with the double beds we ended up with (apparently they were too booked to hook us up with a king bed). There is a large bathtub in the bathroom, but the wall next to it can be opened up completely, so it was like taking a bath in the bedroom. Really pretty and neat. Plus, they had candles set up, so you better believe your heiny I took advantage of those.

My only qualm is that housekeeping came knocking at our door at 11 (check out wasn't until noon), successfully waking us up as we had gone to sleep really late the night before. My husband had to run to the door before they came in, as we were both *ahem* in the nude. He ended up stubbing his toe so hard in the process that his big toenail ripped off completely and therefore effectively ending our little staycation. 

Alas, missing toenail and all, an excellent experience in every way!"}
{"text":"Nice old Phoenix historical property. However : I checked In mid June day temps 108 degrees F. Rate was well below season rack rate at $90 bucks. But upon check in a $30.00 \"resort fee\" and a $15 buck parking fee not mentioned on my corporate travel portal.  Thus they are sneaky , especially in    mid June.  Rooms are great and the ambiance is fantastic. They just sock it to you for extra $$$$ at every turn. Beware. I will review the restaurant T cooks latter but what I have had so far a great roasted beer salad for $12 bucks was the size of a sampling at a restaurant week somewhere. Rip off."}
{"text":"The resort was small & intimate, and we really enjoyed not having a huge crowd of people to contend with. The grounds were gorgeous and immaculately maintained. Service from all staff members was enthusiastic, welcoming and super friendly. We particularly loved Steven from the pool! The pool was never so crowded you couldn't find chairs to sit in. The cushioned chairs were comfy to sit in and the misters by the patio were delightful. If any renovations are done to the pool, I would suggest adding in a shelf/seats on the side, so you could sit in the pool with your beverage ;) 

The eucalyptus steam room in the spa was heavenly! 

Our room was comfortable and clean. We didn't have any issues with noise from the hallway or our neighbors. However, the pillows were awful. They deflated the moment I put my head on them. I would have preferred if there were perhaps 2 different kinds of pillow on the bed, rather than 2 of the same kind. Or maybe another option in the closet. 

More Suggestions: I would have loved a rooftop bar, or at least one that was outdoors. Friends & I thought even a rollaway one, with some hightop tables & stools on the lawn would be a nice option for a pre-dinner drink with friends. (There is one inside, but watching the sunset would be perfect!) I also would have loved a little snack option during the day - chips and salsa maybe in the lobby? or a social hour?"}
{"text":"My original review still rings true. I love it here. It's my staycation of choice without hesitation. I love how lush and green it is, I drive twenty minutes but feel like I'm in a completely new place. The casitas are my favorite place to stay, I'll bring little speakers and play Sinatra or Armstrong out on the patio, light up a nice cigar, have a glass of wine, play a card game, whatever I'm doing I'm happy."}
{"text":"I love the bar at the Royal Palms, not far off the beaten path, yet in a world unto it's own.

You can easily pass the entrance as you cruise down Camelback.  Once you turn into the drive way the valet team greets you to park your car. On the way to the bar, stroll through the lovely garden/fountain area - as you step into a more tranquil time.

The bar has a number of nooks & cranny's, four cool seating sections - the fireplace room, the tables along the windows bordering the garden, the spacious corner and up at the bar. The entire property has an early Arizona motif which is consistent in the bar with comfy chairs & couches and a wonderful mix of floor tiles.

Caitlin, our waitress was welcoming and  crisp with her spot on recommendation's.  Pork  flatbread, was a stand out appetizer with a flavorful consistency of meat, cheese and mushrooms. The Bergstrom Pinot,  a real treat, was a nice compliment to our food.

This gem of a hideaway was the perfect spot for a light bite and glass of vino on a rainy Monday night."}
{"text":"There is no surprise this hotel is #1. The property is amazing. Location is perfect. Service is outstanding. Food is delicious. The Spa offers some of the best services Ive ever had. Cant wait to go back!
Note: Service charges are included with everything including your car service, so no need to tip!"}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel. Amazing customer service. Spa was great. Props to Shannon and Jerri who gave the best mani pedis we have ever had. Couples massage was wonderful.  Would have given 5 stars but I was not impressed with the menu at TCook's. Would've liked to see more salad/veggie options less cheese and meat. Also the bathtub. Uncomfortable...to narrow and deep. Hard to get in and out of. But the shower in our room was inspirational!!!"}
{"text":"Although the resort is amazing, the staff simply doesn't care about you. The first night the bathtub flooded the entire bathroom and part of the bedroom, Jeff came stating that Sarah called him stating that the shower head wasn't working properly( I never mentioned shower head , I am not sure what she heard at this point because it wasn't even about the shower but the bathtub faucet being broken). They moved us to another room after waiting 40 minutes for someone to show up. So we thought things were going to be better but sure it wasn't the case... The second room the lighting wasn't working we didn't get room service the next day so we had to make our own bed and clean around the room. The lighting didn't work so we could barely brush our teeth and take a shower because the lighting wasn't working. The room was nice but everything else just didn't work well. The next morning we decided to go to T cooks the restaurant on the resort and I asked the lady if I could get breakfast to go. She then asks me if it's for my child . What difference does it make ???? I don't have kids and that was for my partner. Anyways, breakfast was good and I thought in everything was still okay. The valet staff was probably the best they were really helpful in giving us directions and suggestions on places to go. The next day ( today) we went to checkout and the gal asked me how was our stay and I told her about what had happened to us , she was dry and just said I am sorry. She didn't care to investigate and ask additional questions she simply didn't care. But the reason of why I am giving this resort a one star is because they assumed a lot. They charged me $100 for pet deposit, when my dog is a service dog ???? First of all they never asked, someone, I am assuming the valet or Jeff from engineering reported that we had a dog and the resort didn't care to ask, even thought when we checked in we had disclosed that our dog ( which by the way was right in front of the lady's face at time of check-in) was a service animal. They didn't care about us nor about our business. My pet peeve is not making assumption and that is all this resort did the entire time we stayed there. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone and I will make sure that the BBB hears from me about them. No sincere apology, they didn't listen effectively, made many assumptions and didn't make us feel at home. Maybe my expectations were higher due to this resort being 5 start, but I sure don't think that scenarios like the one I witnessed happen at other resorts no matter of what the star rating maybe ."}
{"text":"I went here on my honeymoon at the end of October, a Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. My husband and I are 29 and the crowd here was at least 40 and up. They were all business people at convention meetings, which kind of ruined the resort atmosphere. The bar was filled with older men talking about their last meeting. Everyone at the restaurant was over 60. We kind of felt ridiculous saying we were on our honeymoon. It's a nice botanical atmosphere, with fireplaces and fountains throughout, and the staff are quick to please. The food was good, not great. The front desk doesn't have any razors or personal items if you forget any.  Meh.

Alvadora Spa was a good experience, but no better than anywhere else I've been. The facial was abrupt because I had never had one before, which she knew, and she proceeded to not ask me any questions about my face, but just starting applying and removing things, then sending me on my way. I had no idea what had just happened. There wasn't anything bad about the spa... it was just a spa."}
{"text":"The best resort in town. If you're looking for massages, brunch or to relax by the pool. It's gorgeous. I can't wait to go back as it was the best way to relax after a long week. Thank you for the best service in town."}
{"text":"Probably would give it 3.5 stars but no half stars available. Others have pointed out the multiple positive findings at the RP: excellent staff, romantic setting, very good restaurant. Here are the negatives: 
It can be spendy (very) although recently they have been getting more price aggressive here. 
Rooms can be small and dark. I stayed in one of the newly remodeled \"Spa suites\" and would NOT recommend for the money. We never even used the living room area because of its unusual lay out. The balcony was very small as well, most appeared to be that way. 
The pool area is very small so if they are busy the place will get crowded and can be loud. I rented a cabana on a busy Saturday and it was worth the expense given the crowd. 
The spa is small but very very nice, 4-5 star."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to do a little pool day and buy the day bed on resortpass.com we instantly fell in love with this place! The staff is so helpful and nice and they make you feel so welcome! I was especially impressed with the pool staff, it was well over 100 degrees and they served everyone so well and with a smile on their faces. My sister and I will definitely be coming back for another pool day!"}
{"text":"Another day, another staycation. Am I right?  I don't know how I haven't ventured here before , but alas I did when I had friends in town. 

This property is stunning. I felt like I was back in Spain.  The property boasts a maze-like campus and it's easy to get lost.  Rather than feeling like you are on a resort property, it's set up to seem as if you are in a tiny village. Or at least that's how we felt.  

The entire venue is gorgeous and relaxing. The pool is rather small, but as a bonus there are no kids under 15 or 16 allowed.  Therefore the small pool is less annoying without screaming kids interrupting your zen.

We opted for poolside lunch while there and the veggie wrap is to die for.  It's a simple lunch item, but packed with flavor.  Grilled veggies, sprouts, hummus and pesto make for a light, yet filling lunch.  

The spa was amazing and was one of the best facials I've had in the valley. I loved the relaxation room and the smell of eucalyptus that permeated the entire spa.  AAAAHHH, clear sinuses!  My facialist was thorough, and while she did recommend a different cleanser for my face; she wasn't pushing the spa's items.. rather something more basic. Loved that. 

I'd definitely recommend staying here off season to hit the spa and resort deals. you'd never guess you were off a busy road. The resort is relaxing, offers amazing views of Camelback and is completely relaxing!"}
{"text":"Steven at the pool, and Steve the GM were fantastic. It's a very beautiful and intimate resort. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Was there over the weekend and the only good thing about this resort was the pool staff.  They were the only ones who seemed to truly care for their guests.  Sebastien did not stop moving and was accommodating and attentive to every single guest and it was a busy pool day.

We rented a suite for the evening and nothing really special about it. It was dark and felt like a dungeon In sitting area.

Cabana by the pool don't waste your money,  this hotel does not seem to care about their outside furniture.  The cabana looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a month.  While walking around the property every piece of outside furniture was filthy and had bird poop all over it.  I did bring this to managements attention and he took note of it and said he would comp Cabana.  I appreciated that and said thank you.

Fast forward a few days.  I have not seen a reversal on my card.  When I called hotel to inquire I was told manager was not in and to call the next day.  I feel it is not my responsibility to follow up with you as I was your guest and asked for manager to call me.  24 hours have passed and nothing.  Received our bill via email and they tried to also charge us for a room upgrade which we did not get.  When we asked about this we were not so nicely told next time we should check out at front desk to go over the bill in detail.  I'm in customer service and it is not my customers job to police what I am supposed to be doing accurately for them.  And the only thing that should have been said on that call was no problem we will get that taken care of for you.

I will not be recommending this property to any family or friends nor will we be staying again.  It's a shame we do a staycation once a month too."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a walk through this stunning resort and a cocktail. Happy hour drink prices were very reasonable! Definitely would like to stay here in the future."}
{"text":"my then boyfriend, now fiancee took me to a wonderful spa adventure for my bday.

full body massage, facial, mani, pedi the whole works...followed by the eucalyptus steam room ~~~~ i walked out of there feeling like a million dollars baby!

this spa is beautiful and relaxing."}
{"text":"The Royal Palms Resort is a 150 room villa-style resort near the base of CamelBack Mountain.  The courtyards, pools, fountains, architecture, and landscaping are enchanting.  The single lane drive through the palms up to the circular drive sets the tone.  Yes, there were rabbits on the lawn in mid-afternoon.

The staff is attentive and personable; not plastic like some 5-star hotels.  Tipping was added as line item during check-in so you didn't have to rummage your pants pocket after bell service and valet.

Rooms are cozy with low ceiling and décor is area appropriate (wicker & mission) done in a classy way.  Adding to the personal touch is your choice of paper service and an in-room Keurig machine for your morning joe; Wi-Fi is free.  Bathrooms are spacious w/ rustic flair.  Bed is massive and comfy.

One minor negative thing to note is the grounds crew fired up the lawn mower at 8:30 am on the southwest side... no bueno for guests who have a nearby room and were out late the previous night.  Luckily this lasted only 5 minutes...

Didn't eat @ T. Cook's but explored the lounge separate from the dining area -good for its own identity.  Clientele was a mix of locals and tourists and, surprisingly, not stodgy like a W hotel in Manhattan. Drinks are even reasonably priced so I see the draw for locals.

Pool is heated -definitely necessary for taking a dip in late December.  The workout room is a bit smaller than expected but clean & techy w/ about 3 each of treadmills & ellipticals.  Some mats and dumbbells are available also.

The Alvadora is the onsite spa if you're so inclined.  All-in-all this hotel is an amazing value."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Right when we pulled in you enter down a cobblestone driveway and are immediately greeted by the valet. The service was prompt and very kind. They led us to our dinner hall and promptly served us a drink. 

We thought the food was amazing and the atmosphere was relaxed but still very luxurious feeling. In fact we both decided we have to do a \"staycation\" here soon because it is that nice. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow!  What a property, we got a great summer rate through AAA and it was very worth the experience.  It is not a great property for kids so only bring the spouse if you want to get a recharge on such an awesome little place.  It only has one pool but the atmosphere is Spanish Colonial and the landscape is very mature with plants I have never seen in Phoenix.  The bar and restaurant are great little places and the service is second to none.  By far the best staycation we have taken in Phoenix so far.  There are several room styles and we picked up a suite and it was so nice inside and very comfortable.  I will stay here again before I die...hopefully sooner than later."}
{"text":"Anyone who can find fault with this establishment is impossible to please...period.  This resort is exceptional in nearly every way.  The grounds are extremely intimate and phenomenally well designed and maintained...exotic, cozy, sexy, exclusive, warm, inviting.  Pool , workout room, yoga and spa services - quite nice.  Quiet classical guitar playing throughout the grounds by day, candlelit and the air \"scented\" with a fantastic piano player at night.  The food was way above average, the staff; front desk, concierge, bartenders, valet, \"chambermaids\", maintenance engineers were all extremely friendly, courteous and timely.  The other patrons were mature, respectful adults and we had the best time.  One last plus from my angle: no kids...YAY!!!"}
{"text":"We had brunch here yesterday. The staff was friendly and helpful with recommendations. The food was amazing. The graham cracker French toast was our favorite followed by the lemon ricotta pancakes. I would recommend making a reservation, the restaurant isn't that big. I look forward to visiting again when it gets cooler to enjoy the out door seating and possible a happy hour. Their bar area looked like it would be a great spot to start the evening at."}
{"text":"Royal Palm Resort is one of the best place to stay when in Phoenix for its tradition and for its renew beautiful remodels. It feels like a country side resort in the heart of Phoenix / Scottsdale area. Great inside and outside views of famous Phoenix mountains.
Next time in Phoenix get to know this amazing resort!"}
{"text":"Just came from breakfast here, and it was perfect! The location is stunning and relaxing. I got the muesli, and it was wonderful. The dried fruit added the perfect amount of sugar. I also recommend the lemon ricotta pancakes... Terrific! 2 of the people at my table got it, and I had a bite. Just sweet enough! Also, a special shoutout to our waiter, Tonino. He saw our family's last name, and actually got it right, as a fellow Italian. We had a great conversation about traditional Italian pronunciation of words, and he was so spirited. Overall, a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"This beautiful Spanish style resort is so gorgeous and yet casual. We are in heaven - beautiful scenery, warm friendly service and indulgent amenities. We will be sorry to leave../"}
{"text":"This is my favorite hotel. Stayed here twice; once after our wedding, and then to celebrate our anniversary. I can't say enough how wonderful it is, and in every aspect. My husband and I will be coming here for years to come.

Aesthetics: the hotel itself is dripping in old world style and art. Gorgeous features in every direction. 

Staff: so friendly, so nice, and so helpful. I had a somewhat odd request of mailing out a package via UPS, and the front desk just had me drop it off with them and they scheduled a pick-up first thing the next morning. Everyone is willing to help and very positive and friendly. 

Spa: really nice amenities at this spa; relaxation rooms, steam room, outdoor spa, etc. The massages were very nice, too. 

Room: so relaxing and awesome. Especially loved the tub, the steam shower, and the views of camelback mountain."}
{"text":"Lovely brunch, Bellini, omelette with crab, bousin. Delicious bread basket. Courtyard location the best. Beautiful old hotel."}
{"text":"The Montavista Terrace King lived up its website photos! Luxurious linens, elegant & large bathroom, quick-filling (with almost instant hot water) soaking tub, large shower.  Nice view from our comfortable balcony. Flawless check-in experience - personable staff even late at night when we checked in. Bar was still serving a limited menu - excellent service and nice food that night (see my separate reviews for our two dining experiences onsite). 

I'm not a fan of hotel booking websites - been disappointed before BUT tripadvisor offered a Hotels for Everyone deal on this room ($261+resort fee) that was 1/3 off the best price I could get from the hotel when I called in (including asking for a Sr discount). No problems getting the very nice room we reserved.

The maid service was wonderful too. Our room was super clean - frankly I don't usually remark on cleanliness unless its really bad or really good. I travel with my own blanket - this is the only time a maid has made the bed up smoothing out my blanket as I'd set it up the night before - so thoughtful! 

Why not 5 stars? 2 reasons - 1) the onsite restaurant was understaffed & poorly managed - service was horrible. (see separate review if interested). 2) poor signage - my husband was lost for over 20 mins trying to get back to our room."}
{"text":"Had a short business trip in Phoenix and although I did not stay at this resort, I visited the spa and pool area for the day. Let me tell you this place is beautiful!!!! I especially loved all the Spanish themed decor. It didn't feel like I was at the average resort but I felt like I was more on the grounds of a Spanish castle of some sort. The spa area is heavenly. The locker room and  steam room were very clean and relaxing. In back there's a separate jacuzzi area for the spa. Once I was done there I was able to stay at the pool area where these cute little cabanas were located. Since it was pretty hot outside the servers at the bar allowed me to sit there without making a major purchase. The entire staff was super nice! I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"More stars are needed!  Outstanding service and property.  What the team here could provide to many other businesses...service  PLUS.  Truly, you must experience it!  Ask Jack or Andy where some of the best places are to eat...very helpful.  We were so impressed after our first visit in August,  we cancelled another property reservation for our stay in November so we could again stay at the Royal Palms....it was that good."}
{"text":"Our family (7 people) stayed here in four rooms.  We loved our rooms and that they were located in small casitas and not a huge block hotel. The landscaping and grounds are absolutely beautiful.  We enjoyed just walking around the facilities.

The pool and hot tub was very relaxing, and when we were there it was very empty.  T. Cooks restaurant was extremely good and has been one of the best meals I've had in the Phoenix area. 

We spent a day at the spa and enjoyed ourselves. The facilities are small and very pretty. We were asked to wait in the 'relaxation area' between treatments.  It was a lovely area with nice chairs, drinks etc... The very surprising thing was that it was basically the only place people could walk through, so it ended up being the least relaxing place. Every few minutes some one from the staff has to walk through the room to get from the treatment area to the front desk. Once someone even brought what looked like large laundry bags through.  It was a beautiful place and our treatments were great.  I just think the layout and timing of maintenance needs to be rethought.

Frustrations: Check in and check out was slow.  The 'front desk' area is very quaint but too small when several people are needing attention at once.  Plan to wait a while if there is anyone else waiting.  The resort made several mistakes on our bill. They fixed it but only because we caught it. Also, when we came back to our room one afternoon our door was ajar.  We checked the room and nothing was missing.  We called resort security and they were able to trace back who last opened the door with their key card (a resort employee).  It was all ok, but we could have lost our jewelry or laptop if someone had decided to take advantage of the open door.

I loved the food and beauty of the resort, but I don't think I'd stay here again because of the slow check in and out and the security problem."}
{"text":"This was my son's idea and gift to their Mom for Mother's Day. We had reservations for 9:45 brunch and even though we were a few minutes early, there was a nice buzz in the restaurant and they seated us right away. There was a starter buffet with just amazing smoked fishes, meats, cheeses, fresh fruits, salads and breads/pastries. There was a fixed selection of entrees, cooked to order and again, all of our dishes were excellent. Myself and one of my sons had the Surf N Turf (Lobster and Petite Filet), my other son had the scallops and my wife ordered the fish, although I cannot for the life of me remember what kind it was. I do remember however that she loved it and we all had not a single complaint! There was also a dessert buffet with every type of flavor palette you could imagine. Chocolates, truffles, cakes, creme brûlée, tarts and more. Way to go guys! AWESOME!"}
{"text":"The Royal Palms has spacious grounds, but I did not find them to be \"breathtaking\" as others did. Maybe I'm spoiled since I travel a bit and go to southern CA once a month. 

Hotel:

Pros: The valet/bus boys were SO friendly and accommodating-always smiling, upbeat and ready with a cold bottle of water as your left for your summer excursion in Phx. Jenna the customer service manager is over-the-top customer service oriented, she was SO helpful! The yoga teacher was friendly and after over a decade of doing yoga, I learned some \"new\" mudras that I found extremely helpful. Gratuity fee of $15 covers all tips so you don't have to always be reaching for your wallet. And \"Royal Palmers\" (ice cold Arnold Palmers) when you check in!

Cons: We reserved a Montevista Suite with a big bathtub and were \"upgraded\" to a casita, which sounds good, but was in reality a handicap room that lacked a certain charm that was situated along a walkway and had the world's shallowest one-person bathtub. When we asked to be moved to the room we actually reserved, we were told they were all taken (!!) for the night and we moved the next morning. The beds were not great and the one in the handicapped room was actually quite mushy and uncomfortable. The thermostats in the rooms can be set to lower than 72 degrees, but turn off at 72 degrees at night. Well 72 degrees sounds cool, but we needed to have a fan brought in to be cool enough to sleep (and we live in Tucson so heat is not new to us). Drinks at the pool are apparently $20 each according to our bill (!!). Yoga is outside in the mornings which during monsoon season means mosquito-central. 

Restaurant/Bar:

Pros: Chuck the bartender at the Mix Up bar was also top-notch as he chatted us up and explained the specialty drink of the day. Our waiter at T Cooks for dinner was friendly enough and the food there is great! Try the antelope or the tasting menu. 

Cons: Can't think of any. 

Warning: Not knowing any better, we bought the BOGO free deal which listed room rates as $450/night with one night free came out to $225/night. The thing is the rack rate on their website for those nights was $179 and $139. So we could have saved money by getting the rack rate which I found irritating. Luckily Jenna the customer relations manager lowered our rate to the rack rate, but we had to ask and the woman who checked us out was none too happy about me asking to make sure we'd gotten the rate everyone else paid. 

Overall, a mid-range \"resort\" which a decent pool area, pretty gardens/grounds and at times excellent customer service. Overall I'll rate it A-OK, 3 stars. Not great, but certainly good enough (at the reduced summer prices)."}
{"text":"Loved this place...took my mom for mothers day and we were there for 5 hours getting wonderful services and had lunch by the pool. Cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"Totally loved it!  It's so quaint and charming.  I have been to some of the best hotels in the world, and this place rocks!  Here we go:
-charming and professional.  Not uptight like the Ritz Cartlon.  Very, very personable staff
-amazing food and will do special meals like vegan and gluten free.  Breakfast served at 6AM and coffee bar open.  So nice to be served early as some hotels have client wait till 7AM
-wonderful conceirge who helped me w local restaurants and hiking 
-amazing spa.  It's like you have the place to yourself and the staff knows what they are doing
-really nice gym w great equipment
-little nocks and crannies of fireplaces, fountains and outdoor spaces.  I want my house to look and feel like this!

I hope I get back to Phoenix just to stay here again."}
{"text":"There is a place, not so far away, where the wine is delicious and the tranquil sounds of divine music play. Should you arrive at this place with a desire for stomach satisfaction, the food will provide the vehicle for your satisfaction. My family came here to have dinner prior to going to Zoo Lights. Our guide was friendly and gentle. Ryn is the best and was able to direct our choices as to food and drink. We had the pizza which was okay (a little soggy) and the vegetabe plate and the hot dogs with fries and fruit. The place is best with just you and someone that you want to pounce on (super romantic) however, they are kind to children as well."}
{"text":"I had the great pleasure of staying at the Royal Palm Resort and Spa for a work conference (National Geographic) this past weekend. The customer service and the attention to detail were above and beyond what I would normally consider excellent, and I will tell explain why.  From the concierge to the valet, everyone was very friendly and kind.  There wasn't a question they weren't willing to answer. They were extremely helpful and willing to help.  My suite was quite impressive.  I observed how during cocktail hour and dinner, the servers diligently went around to serve us.  During dinner, they served us with such timed synchronization and precision.  What topped it off is what happened on my last day.  I was approached by one of the managers, Sebastian, inquiring on my stay.  I told him how lovely everything had been. I told him in passing that I would have liked very much to go on a hike, yet I had not packed a pair of tennis shoes with me.  This gentleman went above and beyond the duties of customer service and went to the mall and bought me a pair of sneakers.  I have no words to describe my appreciation for this act of kindness.  I would like to commend Sebastian for being so wonderfully kind and this act of generosity.  I will never forget this experience.  From the bottom of my heart, I thank you."}
{"text":"Went to the Royal Palms yesterday for a speaker event for about 80 people, and had one of the best experiences I've had at an event like this. Although we were just there for an hour long speaking event, then an hour of cocktails afterwards, it left a very lasting impression of being delightful.  Every detail was well thought out, from the Valet, to the water glass placements, to the ushers. I will highly recommend this location for future large events."}
{"text":"One of the best resorts I have stayed in. Very different setting. Extremely friendly staff. If I come to Phoenix again, I would definitely stay here. Very relaxing and clean resort. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. The scallops were huge. I had the calamari salad and didn't care for the sauce but loved it with the pesto. The sea bass was my main entree. Full of flavor and so moist. The service was wonderful as well. Our server was fast and attentive. The atmosphere was beautiful. We sat outside and there was a nice breeze due to their huge fan. Then when the night cooled down the fan was turned off and it was perfect outside."}
{"text":"Guys. Seriously? This place is not living up to the hype. My husband and I went here for an overnight stay to celebrate the fact that it was our first time away from our kids, um ever in two years (no big deal) and it was a Father's Day gift. We had booked through hotels.com and relayed the importance of our visit in the reservation. I upgraded the room to a private casita and chose the option to pay at the time of the booking, as opposed to paying later. 
Imagine my surprise when, upon check-in, I am confronted immediately with,\"we need a credit card for this reservation\".  \"I thought I paid ahead, but ok....\"  The front desk attendant then informs us of the $30 resort fee and $15 overnight parking fee. Really? Y'all can't even spring for free parking for your patrons? At a so-called 4.5 star resort? Please. 
The valet gave us a tour of the grounds and he was great. Informative, funny and honest. When we tipped him he made sure we knew that a tip was already included and wasn't necessary. We knew but he deserved the tip anyway, it was just nice of him to be honest.

The stay was nice, the room was fine and dinner was good-but for a $250 check for two people I was expecting more. But what was really great happened next. Once we got home a few days passed and I spoke to my mom. She said she was surprised she didn't hear from me for a big thank you. I asked why? Well it turned out my parents paid for our stay as a nice gesture since we never get out. Odd, I thought, considering the first thing the front desk attendant did was ask for a credit card when my parents sent their info in and wanted to pay for any other incidentals above and beyond the room. I called and talked to the front desk attendant and told her the deal. She didn't sympathize, she didn't apologize, she just transferred me to the accounting department to leave a message. The following day, Eric from accounting called me back. We figured out that my card wasn't charged but there was a $300 hold on my debit that would \"disappear in a week or so\". Now, I don't have a lot of money, so for $300 to be tied up for a week was kind of a bummer. He keep repeating the same info about booking through hotels.com and how sometimes people who pay for rooms want to remain anonymous (I was asking why I wasn't told the room was paid for, why was I even asked to present a card when that part was handled?). He was droning on and I said, \"I don't care about that, what I care about is...\" I couldn't finish my sentence because Eric from accounting interrupted me and said that if I didn't care what he was saying he couldn't help me any further. Then he HUNG UP ON ME! I mean come on! Where's the hospitality? I was furious. I wanted to be done with the shitty ordeal but my friend persuaded me to call again and let management know what happened. So I did. I told her that I didn't want anything from them, that I simply would never come back. She assured me that she would take this higher and have it corrected. With all the awesome deals in the valley during the summer why throw it away on this place? Spend your hard earned money some place else."}
{"text":"This is my favorite hotel to stay at in Arizona. It's a boutique hotel which I love, no chains here. The pool area is so nice, and the rooms are amazing!!! They have different styles and names of the rooms. The hotel makes you feel like your in a garden somewhere magical.

T Cooks restaurant is inside and it's sooooo yummy! I go here with my girls."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for Christmas brunch a couple of years ago and had a very nice dining experience.  A little bit cold inside, but aside from that, everything was perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Driving into the Royal Palms compound set the stage for a great lunch experience. The grounds and landscaping are great, colorful and relaxing, however it was the restaurant that left me smiling. We did not have a reservation during a rather busy holiday lunch crowd, but the maitre de'offered a table on the outside patio. I was all for that, but the people I went with were feeling chilled (being from Tucson and 60 is winter) and hesitated just a bit before saying the patio would be okay. The maitre de saw that short hesitation and made room for us in the dining room. All of the wait staff were just as attentive and perceptive. The food was very good, my cafe latte was fantastic. 
For the price of a mediocre lunch at Applebees I had a great experience at the Royal Palms."}
{"text":"This review is for the Alvadora Spa at the Royal Palms Resort.  My friend planned an amazing weekend in Scottsdale and our day at this resort was relaxing and fun.  This Spanish-style resort is quaint with a very European feel.

I had a deep tissue massage, and it was among the best I've ever had.  Even better is that with any treatment, you can enjoy the rest of the resort for the balance of the day.  Coming from the Chicago winter, we chose to lay by the pool, basking in the Arizona sun with a couple of cocktails.  Perfect way to spend a girl's weekend away!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful intimate boutique style hotel where everything is a close walk, not long distances  like the large resort style hotels.  The service is impeccable throughout.  It is situated in the middle of Scottsdale close to everything, but you feel like you have been transported to a place in colonial Mexico or Tuscany, the gardens awe amazing We stayed in a room that backed up to the street and one could hear traffic in the mornings, but this did not bother me in the least.  I will definitely return to this gem."}
{"text":"Agree with those who describe this place as enchanting.  The rooms are extremely comfortable, the grounds are picture perfect and the pools are very pretty.  We had 8 people in our group ages 15-64 and everyone found something they loved about this place."}
{"text":"By far, one of my most favorite places in Arizona. And I'm a second generation native, I know a lot about this state and a lot about the hidden treasures. This is one of them.

I've been meaning to write a review for sometime as its been quite awhile since we stayed here.

My husband and I got married on April 11, 2009. It was the night before Easter and we had a room booked here. It was not only a holiday weekend but a popular wedding day, so we were competing with a lot of other couples.

We showed up somewhere between 11:30-midnight to check in. Checking in before us was also another bride and groom who apparently got the last regular room. When we got to the front desk we were told they had overbooked. We were crushed as we really wanted to stay here and didn't know what our options were going to be., especially it being so late into the night. Without hesitation we were upgraded to the honeymoon suite, and on them! The staff was so nice, and prompt. It took us less than 10 minutes to check in, even with an upgrade. 

Everyone was so nice. The service was great. The room was huge, beautiful and we had 2 private patios. I wish we were able to stay for more than one night to really appreciate all the amenities. There was a large shower, a separate tub, a living room with lots of seating, and a bedroom with a large king bed. The linens were amazing and so soft. It was just the best experience! 

We ordered room service the next morning before check-out. The food was amazing, it came quickly, and again, the staff was amazing. 

I have no complaints about this place other than I wish we could have stayed a week instead of a night. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Royal Palms is easily in my top 3 resorts in Phoenix. This quaint resort is nestled into camelback mtn and feels like you are miles away from the hustle and bustle of PHX. Whether you are going for a cocktail on one of their many patios, or your staying overnight you will not be let down. The bar and T. Cooks have been renovated to provide more space and maintains the perfect ambiance. The rooms at the Royal Palms are a great extension of the overall resort. Beautiful warm rooms that will give you the comfort of home, but the luxury of a 5 star resort. Go for drinks or for the night, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ideal small, intimate resort with stellar service!  They earned my repeat business.  If you're looking for a large, 5 start Ritz Carlton, go to the Ritz.  If you're looking for a gorgeous setting with a Tuscan vibe, gardens, fountains, nooks crannies and one-on-one service it's ideal.  It's not perfect, but as a frequent traveler it wins in my book!

Resort fee covers all tips - not a usual perk!  Employees still go above and beyond.  Michael S. In valet, Robert and Matt at pool all extraordinary.  We didn't want for anything.  Parking is $15 for one vehicle but only a one time fee and you can go in and out.  This is also a deal for resorts.

We had a travel zoo voucher and were on a tight budget so we used food credits in Mix up Bar.  Great wine, good food but very limited and neither Mix Up or TJ Cooks good for vegans.  TJ Cooks well known and smelled delicious and I'll eat there next time when not on budget travel.

Pool great, but smaller so reserve chairs early.  We never waited for service or water or towels!  These are the perks of smaller property!  Water was very cold but would be good in hotter weather.  Hot tub was too hot to use.

Since we were on a budget we didn't get to use our $40 spa credits because it was limited to massage or body work for 50min or more.  We did get to do free yoga class which was awesome!  Will be better outside when bugs aren't biting.  We also got to use steam room (even though we didn't get services - another perk of smaller property.)  Spa smaller but luxurious with amenities, steam room, showers, small private hot tub women only, and good lotions.

My only complaints were room service dishes all over property and not picked up despite employees out and about.  And better vegan food options.  That sent us off property to close restaurants.  Either way I'll be back.  Rooms were great, romantic, big beds, robes, big bathroom, dressing room, separate bag area and nice showers.  Check for tub if you want to take a bath.  Don't hesitate... great place!"}
{"text":"I am really going against my better judgment in writing this review. Am I wildly, madly in love with everything at the Royal Palms resort? Absolutely!!! Do I want you to go there?? NO! But only because I want this place completely to myself! Located off Camelback at the base of the beautiful Camelback mountain, this boutique resort is a little slice of heaven in the middle of Scottsdale. From the towering palm trees to the lush green foliage to the heady aroma of flowers everywhere you go, this place is an oasis of beauty and relaxation. 

My favorite time to go to the Royal Palms is at night, when the twinkle lights wink at you from hidden corners, and candle glow from the various secluded tables light your way from nook to nook. I recommend going around 8, when the live music starts. Listen to the bluesy singer's sultry, melancholy voice as you enjoy a glass of wine on the garden patio. Or perhaps take a romantic stroll across the grounds until you come across a secret garden tucked away, waiting for you to find it. 

The restaurant and bar are top notch, and have a great happy hour that lasts until 6pm Monday through Thursday. Or, if it's a hot summer day, take a little stay-cation and relax by the gorgeous pool in your own private cabana. 

The entire property is enchanting, and makes you feel like you've stepped into a place where time stands still, and the only thing to do is enjoy the tranquility that surrounds you. But like I said, you really shouldn't go there......"}
{"text":"We came here for a romantic three-night getaway on our anniversary and stayed in a very spacious Alvadora Villa right outside the spa. Valet service promptly greeted us upon arrival. Those guys were great. I appreciated them always asking, \"Will you be needing your vehicle shortly or should we park it in the garage?\" Plus, they were always speedy about getting our car for us when we phoned them from our room. The front desk clerks were pleasant and there was always delicious complimentary Royal Palmer (aka Arnold Palmer + Grenadine) in the lobby.
After setting our things down in our room, we took a late night tour of the resort. Wow! Absolutely gorgeous resort! It's a decent sized resort yet has a small Mediterranean-style feel to it. Since we were hungry, we stopped by T.Cook's Lounge. There was live jazz music and the food was delicious. Be sure to order a Moscow mule.
The following morning, we went to the pool. All the pool servers were extremely attentive. As soon as we walked up to the chairs we wanted, they laid towels down for us and brought out large glasses of iced water. Talk about amazing service! The pool food was good, not great, but we didn't expect too much when it comes to poolside food. The pool area was very quiet and relaxing. Highlight of hanging at the pool? I got stung by a bee in the armpit as I was sunbathing on the pool float bed. Went from relaxed to freak out mode. Awesome! That would only happen to me. After much relaxing in the sun, we went for a hike on Camelback Mountain. Definitely a must. The scenery from up there is pretty cool.
That evening, I managed to break the on/off handle to the bathroom shower as I went to turn it off. And I tell ya, that water came rushing out and pinned me to the wall! As I screamed for help, my significant other yelled out from the loo to see what was going on. It was Dra-matic like only something that would happen in a movie!  Luckily, their maintenance guys responded very quickly and took care of the issue. Oops!
All-in-all, we had an amazing and relaxing time here. I'd highly recommend staying here while visiting the Phoenix area. You won't regret it.
Things we loved about Royal Palms Resort & Spa:
Gratuities were included in the resort fee.
Amazing service from everyone. We were greeted with smiles by all employees everywhere we went on property.
This would be a wonderful place to host a wedding.  Hint, hint, wink, wink.
They had cute resident bunnies hopping around property.
Live music at T.Cook's.
Steam shower.
Private outdoor shower.
Very spacious rooms and clean room.
Free WiFi.
Complimentary Royal Palmer (aka Arnold Palmer + Grenadine) at the front desk.
Surrounding scenery."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at \"4 Star\" resort!!! We stayed here mid July for our Mini-honeymoon. My wife and I were married on Friday July 17th and had a reservation for Friday and Saturday night. We arrived at around 11:45 PM and checked in. I gave them my MC/Debit card and they charged $650 which I understood because we used debit. The next day they had no record of the charge and even told me they didnt have a card on file.  I showed the manager it was still charged to my account as a charge of $650 for Royal Palms and emailed her a copy. She asked for the card again and promised she would only run it for 1.00 just to have card on file. Over the next 24HRs they charged $449.01, $1.00, $200, $100 and $49. The next morning I complained and the front desk acted like it was no big deal even though it was coming direct out of my available funds. Two days later they were still charging my card. To cut this short because of Royal palms I incurred two NSF fees and had to use anoth card to pay my insurance. They have no respect for the working class!!!! Plus they never returned my calls after I left."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a staycation!!!  It really feels like you are at a Mexican resort.  We went in July and got good use of the pool.  It is smaller, but served it's purpose of relaxation and had really attentive service.  The rooms are very nice and romantic.   They have a great lounge with live music and excellent mixologists.  I didn't get a chance to try the  restaurant, so I will definitely return for that, as I have read and heard great things.  If I remember correctly, all tips are included so no need to worry about awkwardly pulling out your wallet.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary by staying at the Royal Palms Resort. We journeyed windy walkways surrounded by manicured lawns, beautiful trees and blooming flowers. Our casita was lovely, private and had an incredible view of Camelback mountain. The staff surprised us by delivering a plate of yummy chocolates that said Happy Anniversary on it. We enjoyed a delicious dinner at romantic, Mediterranean T Cooks. We relaxed in the jacuzzi under the stars. The service at the hotel and the restaurant was impeccable-everyone was very friendly favorite person was James-the bellman-he has been there many years and really knew the history of the resort. We enjoyed the intimacy of this smaller resort-it was a memorable celebration, worth the investment and we plan to go back."}
{"text":"Romantic, cozy and beautiful environs. The staff is top notch. Our room had a comfortable king-sized bed and a warm gas-fired fireplace. The decor is sort of rustic Spanish Mediterranean.  Always the mark of a great hotel, they will deliver the New York Times to your room each morning.  Be sure to have a cocktail -- I recommend the Pepino Diablo -- in the Cigar Room at the end of the evening. This is easily one of our favorite hotels in the United States!"}
{"text":"I won't ever stay or recommend the Royal Palms Hotel!  I tried booking a room with a gift certificate - which they were not willing to honor 1 of the days (the information on the certificate is extremely misleading).  When the representative told me we could \"book the room now and I could talk with the manager later\", I said ok.  After booking and specifically asking which room type the certificate qualifies for - he said \"either\".  So I booked the larger room.  After giving him my credit card (assuming it was for incidentals) he tried to tell me to have a nice night and hang up.  I reminded him that I still wanted to speak with the manager about the second night.  I was transferred to the front desk - I asked for a manager and was given reservations --- AGAIN!  I explained why I wanted the manager and when he looked up my reservation - the gift certificate wasn't even mentioned on the reservation!!!  I was then told I couldn't use it for those dates.  Now - I'm really mad!  After explaining my 38 minute conversation with the other representative it was clear he was not going to help.  I told him to cancel the reservation (I was still ON the SAME call I made the reservation with) - he told me he'd have to see if he could WAIVE THE CANCELLATION FEE!!  It's clear this hotel has lost all sense of customer service!  I'll never recommend this hotel again - 38 minutes of nightmare!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place!  Great service, rooms are unique and food is excellent. Property is beautiful as well. Great place to have a management meeting or even a \"hide away retreat\" with someone special!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the nicest place I have ever stayed at...
We stayed there the night of our wedding, before we headed to the airport in the morning for our honeymoon.  I don't know where to start, this place is overall phenomenal.  We were treated like royalty the whole time and we had the best service imaginable."}
{"text":"I attended an anniversary at the Royal Palms, and was so taken with it that I booked a room and treatments... I only live a few minutes away, and I didn't go home all weekend.

It is everything you would expect from an exclusive resort. Every last detail is perfect. The ambience is intoxicating, and the service is the best in the Southwest. The meal they catered for the anniversary was above average, and my meal at the restaurant was superb. 

Tourists who are looking for Sedona-style views, remember that Scottsdale is a major city. Locals might be put off by the Southwest decor in the rooms (it's not my favorite, though still well-excecuted here). I probably wouldn't go just for the spa treatments, but they were still excellent."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the finest hotel services, location, design, decorating, layout etc.. than anything else anywhere. Fabulous restaurant.
Come and stay often.

{"text":"So we picked this hotel as a romantic get away through Hotwire. When we arrived there was some mix up  with the room that Hotwire didn't know about but the hotel did. We apparently had the room cancelled, yet nobody told us. This was after 9.30pm at night. Long story short the manager was able to put us in the main suite for one night and we moved rooms for the next night. 

The pool was great, and we hired a cabana for a hundred dollars which was nice as the service was stepped up a level and it also had a fan.

The food at the bar and music entertainment was good with an intimate feel.

This hotel is perfect for couples wanting an romantic get away."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding.  Room was lovely and spacious. The staff couldn't have been nicer, more supportive, and more attentive.  The grounds were immaculate.  It was like this large beautiful oasis in the middle of town. 
My wife spent many hours in the spa   She got a hot stone massage (thanks Stacey) and many off hours in the steam room, jacuzzi, relaxation room and by the fire just reading and drinking tea and having snacks. 
The bar was just perfect...cozy, great service, great menu.  The steak bites...awesome.  Ok, I loved that bar.  We only had breakfast at the main restaurant...expensive but delicious 

We will return."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I spent the day at the Spa. My facial was just OK, nothing special. This review, however, is specifically for the 2 young men working as attendants at the pool (one was Steven, forgot the second one's name)... they were excellent. They came around every 15 minutes, refilling our waters. They were polite, helpful when it came to putting up/taking down the umbrellas, and did a great job with our lunch orders. They made the experience top-notch."}
{"text":"The grounds are gorgeous. Interior and decor are rustic chic. I am in love with this place! I will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"This place is so quaint and awesome. Service excellent.  Food and T Cooks restaurant is unique and 5 star.  Beautiful  atmosphere.  Well organized."}
{"text":"This review is a little late, but me and my girlfriend stayed at the Royal Palms for two nights over July 4th weekend.  Once you get on the grounds it is like you have left Phoenix.  The staff was exceptional.  We had a Valencia Casita which is so private and roomy.  I enjoyed the exercise room on second floor which offered a view.  The pool area is ok, but don't expect towels too early in the morning.  My girlfriend had a massage at the spa and was very happy.  The bar and restaurant are first rate.  Overall has become one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful stay on a resent trip to Arizona. We loved the history of the place and the grounds were beautiful. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. Our room was very comfortable and clean. Loved the towels. All in all we had a great stay."}
{"text":"Great old-school Resort in the Phoenix Paradise Valley area. I have been here many many times and it does not disappoint. Beautiful architecture Landscaping attentive friendly staff and a great place to stay if you're in the Phoenix area"}
{"text":"The Royal Palms is a beautiful and classic Phoenix resort.  Just driving up the palm lined driveway gives you the feel of elegance and class.  The staff is very professional and courteous, and the rooms are beautifully decorated -- they have a Southwest feel with all the modern conveniences.  Simply gorgeous!  The only drawback is that pool area is kind of small, so there is not much seating.  Otherwise, this place is pretty fantastic."}
{"text":"Stunning, gorgeous, heavenly!  I have a new-found like for the desert...if it's going to be at a place like this.

Impeccable, friendly service, extremely accommodating.  Excellently appointed rooms.  There was a giant tub in my room that I didn't even jump in (why???).  There were nice smells everywhere.

I was here for a wedding and had an amazing view of the mountain behind the hotel....very pretty at both dusk and dawn.

This place is both peaceful and cozy.  The beds were super comfy.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing and care-free getaway....you won't have to do a damn thing but get there."}
{"text":"The service here at Royal Palms Resort is Spa is top notch.  They really value their customers.  One of the first days, the cleaning staff either didn't do a good job or forgot about our room.  When I reported this to the front desk, they were very apologetic and told they would contact the Executive from the cleaning department.  In addition to that, they provided money credit and other money saving perks to help us with our situation.

The resort is truly well decorated as we dressed up and took pictures around the property.  The proximity to Camelback makes this resort even more breathtaking."}
{"text":"For the past 15 years I have had nothing but great things to say about the Royal Palms Resort.  My wife and I have stayed there many times over the last 15 years.  It was our favorite getaway.  It's everything we look for in a resort.  It's a shame that they have ruined our high opinion of them. My wife and I purchased the \"Royal Romance\" package about 6 weeks ago to celebrate my birthday and our 29th anniversary. Everything was beautiful (as usual) and the service staff excellent (as usual). The casita we stayed in was more run down than we remembered and the steaks we had for our meal were sub-standard but those problems we could live with.  The real problem was the final billing.  The package cost in the neighborhood of $550.00 and included several perks.  When we checked out they charged us $950.00 for the room and other items!  We voiced our concern upon checking out with the front desk and they told us they must have charged us for a villa instead of the casita.  Unfortunately it was Sunday and they already charged our card.  They suggested we call Marilee in accounting, which we did.  Long story short, 9 phone calls and 6 weeks later and we have no resolve.  Marilee said they were waiting for accounting to credit our card for the $400.00 error and this was a month ago.  Now she just ignores my calls. It really is a shame that they destroyed our image of this beautiful resort.  In addition, My wife and I were planning to renew our vows at the Royal Palms next May for our 30th anniversary.  We were inviting a small group of family and friends to join us.  It looks like we will have to find another location.  Jim Scott"}
{"text":"Everything was great, just not really impressed with the room/casita. It's a great place, my rating is only based on comparison with other hotels with equivalent pricing."}
{"text":"The facilities were really nice. I loved the pool and eucalyptus steam room, and the grounds were beautiful! 

My massage was just okay though. My therapist got me late so it ended up only being a 40-minute massage instead of 50 minutes. Not enough time to release my tension. I still had knots in my back and neck when I left. This was not acceptable for how expensive it is. It could have just been my therapist though. I overheard other people raving about their massages."}
{"text":"Wow, when I die...is this heaven? Almost

The grounds of Royal Palms is heavenly and the casitas are very well appointed.  You cannot hear a peep from the outside, once you close your door. The entire staff is super friendly - almost cult-like, in a good way. 

The pool is small, but peaceful - the poolside servers are always there with your ice water w/ lemon.  Order the Royal Palmer, which is their house cocktail.  Very refreshing, yet strong.  Downside of the pool ambiance is the staticky radio.  For a place like Royal Palms, you would think they would install a better sound system with some down tempo music in loop. 

Other downside is their pillows - too soft and flat.  I kept meaning to call the front desk to ask for firmer pillows.  I'm sure they would have some. 

Other than that - The Royal Palms is pretty close to perfect, sans any car envy when your Honda Insight is sandwiched between a Lambo and a Ferrari."}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix for just over a year and my fiancé surprised with a two night stay at the Royal Palms resort for my birthday this past weekend. This resort has always been at the top of my list to stay since every time we drive past it, the entrance looks incredible. I was more than thrilled when I found out we would be spending two nights there! 

Since my fiancé had to work one of the days, he invited my girlfriends to accompany me to the hotel pool. Upon arriving, the resort was as impressive as I had hoped for and we were greeted nicely by the valet service. We asked for self parking and was directed to go down to the garage located nearby. The other two cars ended up using valet but they weren't offered the self parking option and ended up tipping the valet. No big deal but the option would have been nice.

The reception area is a small room with two love seats and while intimate, it wasn't as grand as I expected. Checkin was fast but since we arrived at 9:30am I was told that we could use the pool until the room was ready and we could change in the spa. We made our way to the spa and the grounds are very beautiful. Everything is green and lush, a big contrast from the desert this time of year. There are lots of fountains and intimate seating arrangements through out the property. The spa staff was friendly but the spa did seem a bit small. The locker area was small and only two stalls with toilets and another two shower stalls. Again, this is a boutique resort though and it matched the architecture and the finishes were all nice in the area. 

The pool chairs are very comfy and have large towels that won't slip down the chair.  I was surprised to see that one of the towels on my girlfriend's chair was nearly warn through in several places. That's not something you see in a five star resort. Friendly wait staff came by within 10 minutes and gave us each a big plastic cup of lemon water. The pool is small but there were numerous chairs around the pool. The pool temperature was great and the landscaping was very nice. Something that was really disappointing was there was no music. After looking around further, I realized there aren't speakers except in the bathroom. I've never been to a resort pool without music so it was a bit... quiet. I'm all for quiet and relaxing but at times, it was TOO quite. On the second day there was a family there with their kids and it made their splashing and loud talking all the more noticeable. Also, they had three pool floaters that had definitely seen better days. I'm not sure why this resort wouldn't replace them? It seems like such a small, easy and inexpensive thing to do. Pool service was a bit sparse and several times we had to make our way to the bar to order items.  We always had to ask for everything which was unusual. Menus, towels, water....nothing seemed preemptive on their end. Additionally, the second day, the area was a mess. Towels everywhere, chairs not setup for the next guest, empty drinks on several tables. I think there was only one person working but I still wouldn't expect to see that at a resort of this caliber. There were also several ugly crows in the area that were very aggressive.  One landed on my friend as she ate her lunch and the waiter told us a story of how just the other day one dive bombed a customer and took her taco. Ummm, aren't there bird wranglers or something? 

Our room was ready by 12pm and we were in an upgraded Valencia Casita. We were way in the back of the property and were directly next to another resort. Upon entering the room, they did have a nice plate of chocolate fudge and fruit and said Happy Birthday on the plate. Unfortunately, my birthday wasn't until the next day but it was a nice gesture. 

The room was nice but it did seem a bit dark. The ceilings were low and the exposed beams on the ceiling added to the feeling. The furnishings and the bathroom finishes were nice. The tile floors added some character and it was nice having a Keurig machine in the room.  The shower had great pressure and nice tile. Our bed was comfy but it was really high off the ground so it was a definite jump to get in. The pillows were both flat, one down and one regular cotton fill. The nightly turn down service gave you two tiny water bottles on your bedside and filled the ice bucket. On our second day, we left the room at 10am and returned at 2pm and the room had yet to be cleaned. Our turndown service came around 7:30pm the second day and left a dirty plate outside our door. 

Overall, the resort is nice but that's just it. Nice. For the value and the reputation, it wasn't up to my expectations. I expected to be wowed by this place but it just never happened."}
