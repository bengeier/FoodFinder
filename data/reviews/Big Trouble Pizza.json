{"text":"I've walked by this stretch of Spadina at least a few hundred times, and though these guys opened up in Jan, I just noticed them.  We hopped in for a quick bite. Was a bit \"what's going on here?\" but one of the guys explained what they were upto.  We got the Kung-Funghi and the Butter Jam Jam.  Both were *delicious*. The crust was absolutely fantastic. I don't even like to normally mix sweet with savory (aka the Butter Jam Jam), but they pulled it off.  Definitely worth a try. I'll be trying the other pizzas soon..."}
{"text":"Honestly the best pizza I've ever had.  Big Trouble Pizza is a small pizza shop tucked away on Spadina in Chinatown. We happened to pass by one evening and their sign caught our eyes so we went in. We learned that they had opened recently (just a few months old) and specialized in unique pizzas. We got the Butter Jam Jam (raspberry jam, butter cream, mozzarella, bocconcini, balsamic reduction, lemon zest) as well the MF Prashoots (prosciutto, mozzarella, portobello, truffle ricotta). They both tasted amazing. My favourite of the two was the Butter Jam Jam but you cannot go wrong with any of their pizzas. It's evident that they put a lot of thought into them and use only the freshest ingredients.  In fact the pizza was so delicious that after we finished eating our slices we went back to let them know how much we enjoyed it. We met Sam behind the counter and he was absolutely the nicest. He let us know that they're currently experimenting with other flavours and will likely have a pizza on rotation on top of the ones on the existing menu. I'm really looking forward to coming back and trying more - I'm still thinking back to that slice of Butter Jam Jam!"}
{"text":"Cozy little place that happened to catch my eye as I was walking by.  Got a slice of the funghi and it was delicious - thin crust, lots of flavour but without feeling heavy or greasy. Will be coming back for the buttercream jam slice which also looked pretty good. Oh and the staff are amazing! Extremely helpful and nice!"}
{"text":"The men that run this little Chinatown pizzeria are so sweet and enthusiastic. They take a moment to smile, greet and converse with each customer, regardless of how busy they are. I always leave this place in a better mood than before I entered.   Once I leave, I have a delicious, inventive and perfectly made pizza in my hands! Not only are the different pizzas flavourful and interesting - they're reasonably priced, and topped with high quality ingredients. The dough is substantial, crispy and chewy all at the same time - a total departure from the New York/Chicago style dough trend that has swept the city in recent years.  I wish these guys total success. This place is an absolute joy!"}
{"text":"Tried a pizza slice here on Sunday, it is absolutely one of the best pizza slices I ever had for a long time, perfect crust, great flavor, truly good stuff."}
{"text":"Probably the best pepperoni pizza I've had in TO! The crust is thin, yet chewy and crispy; the tomato sauce is sweet and savoury; the pepperoni has a nice smokey flavor; and the cheese has the perfect amount of grease, just the way I like it!"}
{"text":"Had the Kung-Funghi and Butter Jam Jam. Loved the unique flavour combinations and they've done a great job perfecting the crust. On top of all that, thumbs up for the spectacular service. This place is a must for any pizza-lover!"}
{"text":"Great pizza & super friendly! While I always dream of Chicago deep dish pizza, this pizza is the total opposite; it's so easy to eat and keeps you wanting more. Their crust has no eggs and is super flavourful (something some pizza places forget to do is season their dough).   The Butter Jam Jam was great - it doesn't taste like dessert which is good. The lemon zest adds the essence of lemon to lighten up the multiple cheeses on it!   The MF Prashoots with prosciutto and truffle ricotta is my jam! The truffle ricotta really is bomb for those who love truffles!   My first stab at a pizza place in TO and I'm hooked! Have more than one if you can"}
{"text":"Super interesting pizza toppings on a consistently good crust. The Kung fungi had some nice heat. Try it. Best pizza I've had in Canada."}
{"text":"Flavorful decent pizza slice If u like cheese, their cheese is good  The crust is not my personal favorite(thin and slightly soggy)"}
{"text":"An awesome spot to stop for a unique slice. I had a slice of the Kung-Funghi and Butter Jam Jam. Both were spectacular.   The guys that run the place are chill and friendly. I ate my two slices while chatting with them about the Raptors. The decor is tight; the artwork is indebted to the movie \"Big Trouble in Little China,\" which is, of course, one of the best movies ever made.   You can't talk pizza in Toronto until you've tried them."}
{"text":"Amazing and unique pizza flavour combinations. One of the best pizza I have tried for sure.  We ordered 3 slices and they charged us for only two: Butter Jam Jam, Kung-Funghi, and MF Prashoots.  Butter jam jam was by far the most unique pizza I've ever tried, made with Raspberry Jam,  Butter Cream, Mozzarella, Bocconcini,  Balsamic Reduction, and Lemon Zest. I know, I know, it sounds really weird, but it was the BEST PIZZA IVE EVER HAD.   Definitely worth a try. Kensington / Chinatown area is lacking is good pizza, and this place definitely fills that void."}
{"text":"Cool little spot right in the middle of Chinatown. Tried the \"Butter Jam Jam\" which has \"Raspberry Jam, Butter Cream, Mozzarella, Bocconcini, Balsamic Reduction, Lemon Zest.\" The crust was super thin and had those sought after burnt spots on the bottom which contrasted well with the sweet berry sauce. Those flavors were mellowed out with the all the creaminess and contrasted even further with the tartness of the balsamic and lemon. Great departure from typical slice shops and had an interesting (read: funny) convo with one of the guys about whether or not this was considered a dessert pizza. It felt like I had insulted a renaissance artist by hanging one of their paintings on my fridge.  Rating: 4 Artists Who Cut A Body Part Off out of 5"}
{"text":"Best slice in the city hands down. Butter Jam Jam is my jam and it is a must-try, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the mouth f*ck of flavour, I promise you. I inhaled two slices, no shame. *THANK YOU BIG TROUBLE*"}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious light yet satisfying pizza and run by the nicest crew! The kung funghi was amazing - will definitely be coming back for more!"}
