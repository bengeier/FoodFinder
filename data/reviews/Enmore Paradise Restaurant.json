{"text":"My friend at work treated me for lunch here, I was amazed how great the food was. The good thing too is that they put the spicy sauce aside for the ones that not spicy lovers.  The price is reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food. It has a nice and clean atmosphere. The staffs are also nice and attentive. I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Finally a West Indian restaurant in Newmarket. The real deal here, the doubles are amazing, Roti great too. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing. From the kind service to the fresh eats you can't beat it. Bought a variety of food to try this place out - doubles, chicken roti, jerk chicken, sweet and sour chicken, chicken fried rice, spring rolls, Enmore Lo Mein.. All of it was tasty and fresh. Love the down to earth feel when you call in- just great service all around. Hot sauce is also beautiful. Check this place out! Got to love supporting local spots like this. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My brother and sis in law took us here on a Saturday drive. Didn't expect Newmarket to have a great west Indian spot tbh, but the food was great! We definitely ordered way too much lol. Lo mein, pepper shrimp, chicken curry, chicken wings, fried rice and beef with broccoli.  The man that served us was so nice and felt like we were eating with family, he treated is real nice. The food was fresh and priced well. Chicken wings were great and the roti was yummy.  This place has a steady flow of take out mostly but lots pf space to eat in. Will definitely be back and recommend it. Scarborough seems to be missing the fresh factor when it comes to food lt"}
{"text":"I'm pretty envious of the kids at the high school nearby that get this place right beside their school with pretty amazing deals for lunch specials. I was hoping to be blown away by this place because I heard alot of talk in the community about it. Mind you I have a Guyanese mother in law... so I think this is why i'm incapable of giving Enmore's a better higher review. I know once someone makes this type of food, better then my mom.... they will recieve a 5, if you aren't as good.... you get sub 4. Great lunch deals tho for sure!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Enmore for the first time and I will be ordering again for sure!  Excellent food and service.  I can't begin to say how happy I am to have such a quality carribean restaurant in Newmarket!"}
{"text":"I found my experience here to be excellent, very homey and the staff was so nice. Overall the food was amazing and great portions. A++++"}
{"text":"Growing up in Scarborough with Guyanese parents, I couldn't have been happier and also a bit apprehensive when I first came across this eatery. I was not sure how authentic it would be up in Newmarket. But, it did not disappoint. If you've only had Taste of the Island's curry, you need to come here! Jamaican curry and Guyanese curry are NOT the same. Guyanese curry rules!! Make sure you also get some potato balls! Mmmmm"}
