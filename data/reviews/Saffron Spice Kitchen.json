{"text":"This isn't entirely fair, I just popped in for a samosa today over lunch. Worst samosa I've ever had, should have taken a picture. I actually didn't mind that it was baked not fried, but it was under baked, mangled, luke warm, not spicy, and the veggies inside were sad."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The kothu roti is made fresh to order - it's delicious, the portions are generous and reasonably priced. The staff is very friendly and helpful. It has become my go-to place for a quick meal in Queen west."}
{"text":"This food was amazing. We are from Florida. And this was just great. Must go. We tried the mango lassi and the kothu roti, it was amazing."}
{"text":"Great South Indian takeaway food in the heart of downtown Toronto. The service is great and the food is so fresh and tasty! The portions are huge and well priced.

I definitely recommend this place and if you go you should try the Lamb Kotthurotti!"}
{"text":"One of my go to take-away restaurants. Their Kothu roti is always fresh, flavourful & filling. It's like a cuddle in my mouth...
 I always request special spice levels and they're so accommodating and kind! I love the abundance of flavour in the K-roti.. I always get the butter chicken variation and it's soooo tasty. Last time I changed things up and got the lamb wrap which I'd highly recommend! Lots of packed yummy veggies and SE-Asian spices. Pairs well with the mango lassi whoop whoop. Thanks Saffron team! Always so tastyyyyyyy"}
{"text":"Just ordered from these guys and I must say the service is horrible!  

First off, I tried ordering through their website but at checkout the status said invalid.  So I decided to call in my order but when my food came the price was $10 more than what was stated online.  I call to ask why the price difference and he had no explanation. I told him the website had a different price and his reply was that the site wasn't working properly and needed updating...That's nice to know after we placed the order.  I tried to ask him if they can honour the prices they listed and he proceeds to tell me that he's \"busy\" and then hangs up.  Not to mention they added the wrong veggie and overall the serving was small for the \"new\" cost. First and last time I'll be ordering from these guys."}
{"text":"Super amazing food! Highly recommended their seafood khothu roti and lamb rolls! Planning to come back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"we went there today after hearing a lot of good things. i'm very fussy about indian food so was hoping it would be all right. it was very pleasant and the chef and the person behind the counter were VERY friendly and helpful. i prefer everything spicier but i understand most people don't. i had veggies - rice, dhal, sag paneer, eggplant and potato (chef offered me an extra veg since i didn't want much rice). the eggplant was my favourite part. my son had a tandoori chicken wrap and said the flavours went together very well. the small one was enough for him for lunch. i would go back. also that was a very nice mango lassi. thanks, guys! it gets four stars because it was a bit tame on the spice. somehow when a non-indian person goes into an indian restaurant there's an assumption you are scared of spice and might not know anything and be scared off. saffron, you might be surprised! some of us DO know what we're doing. :)"}
{"text":"Aw man the best! So good! Best Indian food in Toronto, can't wait to go back. Good, fresh food. The chef's there really deserve a shout out. I'm looking forward to bringing all my friends there to try it. I'm hooked,  I'm walking to there to grab food while typing this."}
{"text":"Indian food never tasted so good in a wrap!  Great for a quick lunch, good variety and prices. I had the tandoori chicken wrap for 7.50 wow!  Delicious and made to your spice thresholds."}
{"text":"Had the butter chicken KOTHU roti and it was sooooo delicious! If your looking for something that is unique and one of a kind then this is it. I've had Kothu roti before and this one is definitely my favourite. they've really managed to play around with the flavours. I also had one of their Mutton Rolls and it was so crispy. The inside was also perfectly seasoned and moist. I would recommend the rolls and mango lassi too."}
{"text":"As far as take out places go this one is great.  You gotta like spice though! I've had all the Kothu Roti and they're great.  Service can be a tad slow but they're obviously well intentioned and getting better.  I call my order in now and don't wait.  Definitely a great spot."}
{"text":"There are so many good curry options around....just don't

To be absolutely fair, I didn't go at lunch...when I imagine things are hot and fresh.  I went at dinner time and it was really not very nice at all.

The Roti was edible enough...if a bit lukewarm.  It had some nice spice and the chicken had some good flavour..but it looked horrible (like it had been sitting around).

I also tried a fish curry special, which was horrendous.  It was a steak cut of some fish in with some rice, some peas and other vegetables.  Everything in the dish was super bland, but worse than that -The whole thing was cold... the fish had obviously been sitting around all day not on the heat. 

 Food poisoning waiting to happen."}
{"text":"Best new takeout spot downtown. The chicken kothu roti is unbelievable. Very few places serving fresh to order food like this. Authentic spices and herbs, fresh veggies, very reasonably priced. All around 5-star."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for takeout indian/fusion.  VERY tasty and generous portions, I typically get one of the specials and get a large plate with samosa to tide me over as they prep, for just under $10.  Now one of my favourite lunch spots nearby, I haven't had a bad dish yet.  Nice guys too.

One star lost as they're a tad disorganized during rushes, but they're working it out."}
{"text":"Saffron Spice Kitchen es, de ahora en adelante, mi lugar favorito para comer delicias de la India. 
Desde que llegamos al lugar, nos recibieron muy bien y respondían a nuestras dudas sobre cada uno de los platillos, pudiendo elegir con seguridad lo que queríamos probar. 

Lo que mis amigos y yo ordenamos fue: 
Butter Chicken Roti 
Spicy Lamb Wrap 
Samosa 
Mango Lassi 
Mulligatawny soup

El precio es muy accesible y los platillos DE LI CIO SOS; lo mejor es que puedes pedir de todo y compartir con tus amigos!!!"}
{"text":"Value for $ is good, but between the 4 of us we could not agree on a number of stars. 2 of us can handle the spice but, not the other two. We asked for very very mild and bland but, that didn't translate at all. On the other hand, the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"I had the lamb wrap today and my mouth got an explosion of flavours! Two thumbs up for this place. \"I'll be back...\""}
{"text":"I could eat the this kotthu roti ALLL the time. Almost reminds me of Indonesia's Nasi Goreng - a perfect balance of flavors, spicy, salty, umami, sour, sweet - that uses leftovers (bread here, rice for nasi goreng) to a great, stir fried effect.

Great price, and I don't know who the wusses are who are complaining about the spice level ; ) It was NOT very hot imo. But I guess ask for less spice if you think it would behoove you. I could've done with a bit more, myself."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken kothu roti and was not disappointed. I was in Sri Lanka last spring and it tastes like the real thing.Tasty and good service."}
{"text":"Serendipity...was on vacation in Toronto for a week and ended in this tiny place when the words \"Kothu\" popped up on my yelp. Kothu in tamil literally translates to mash/tear something. I was treated to a most wonderful and authentic Kothu Parotta (Called Roti in this joint) that i have had away from home. The spice combination, hotness and roti consistency was perfect and the portion was generous. Even the Vegetarian Kothu Roti was mind-blowing (traditionally a kothu is made with egg or combination of egg and meats). I have to thank John (the chef, who turned out to be from my hometown of Madras) for making my Tamil New Years day really memorable and will most definitely be back to this place whenever i'm in town or might even fly down for the weekend just to have more of this...Also have to mention that the mango lassi was very good and eagerly awaiting to to try some of the other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was okay tasting, service was friendly, portion size was disappointing.  I ordered butter chicken and veggie curry on rice - I got four pieces of chicken.  Four little cubes.  The veggie curry was also a very small spoonful.  The takeout container was mostly just rice.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious lamb kothu roti ! Not much quantity though. Will come back if I pass by again"}
{"text":"Found this on yelp as I was looking for dinner options. I went with the most popular item which was the kothu roti. And went with butter chicken. I was expecting a roti... As in a wrap. So I was very surprised when I got the food...... The flavours are not bad and even though I asked for mild, I found it quite spicy. I think the kothu roti is a dish that you'd need to get used to. I may come back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch yesterday; the place at the time of writing this has not been opened for more than 2 weeks yet. It's pretty competitive along that stretch of Queen Street as it's a few doors down from a Burger's Priest and across the street is Banh Mi Boys. Not to mention the various other sushi and sandwich shops not to far off either. 

As I entered I can very clearly notice a person being trained in operating the cash register. No biggie; they barely been around so it's no problem that they don't have the place in full shape/order yet. With a bit of instruction; they got my order through. 

I ordered the Curried Chicken Kothu Roti. For $5 before tax; it was quite generous in portions (you get a container filled to the max) and it filled me right up. It was pretty good and you can see it being prepared 2-3 meters in front of you. 

My only real gripe was the sample of soup they gave me while I waited for my food. It was salty and really didn't have any sort of taste beyond the taste of salted chicken water.

The staff members, though a bit nervous, were overall pretty friendly. They sounded like they really needed a boost so I thought I'd make this my first review. 

Check this place out folks; it at least deserves a try! I just hope the quality of the food and portions will still be great over the next few months as I will return!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, flexible and friendly staff.  Coconut Chicken w/ vegetable curry was excellent, manager put in extra curry since I'd asked for no rice.  Clean and comfortable, WiFi on request - great place, highly recommended for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken kothu roti and the tandoori wrap, both were amazing. Kothu roti was spicy as hell but really good!!"}
{"text":"Been travelling North America for a month & been craving some Sri Lankan food. A guy I met in Toronto sid unless you go to Scarborough the best kotthu place in Toronto is spice kitchen & it didn't disappoint me. 
I highly recommend the vegetarian kotthu here"}
{"text":"Tried their butter chicken roti and samosa via foodora delivery service. 

Roti was all chopped up which is surprising when I was expecting a wrap sort of roti. Because it was so chopped up, I actually could not really tell what I was chewing on -_- well, I know there gotta be some bread and some chicken but overall it is an mediocre experience as I personally prefer chunky potatoes and chicken when I am eating a roti.

Finally, although the pastry of the samosa is good, the inside of it lacks of ingredients which made me feel like I am merely eating a bread..."}
{"text":"Try the Kothu Roti with lamb or butter chicken it's delicious. Or go for any of the lunch combos with a mango lassi!"}
{"text":"Decided to order from this place tonight. Placed my order online then called them and asked them to  add two naans to my order which they said no problem. 

On the email confirmation it said the order would take 50 minutes. I receive an email after 50 minutes saying that my order is on its way. It's been now more than 2 hours since I ordered and no delivery showed up and they didn't contact me. Tried to call them more than 5 times only to find out that they are closed for the day.

So I have no idea what happened to my order. There is no way I'm ordering from them again. 1 star is way too high of a rating for a business like that."}
{"text":"This nice little place at Queen and Spadina is a paradise for Indian food lovers or anyone who is looking to try something new. Their Butter Chicken Kuthu Roti is the best in Toronto. The staff is very nice and welcoming. Great place for lunch or an evening snack after work."}
{"text":"Tried their butter chicken kothu roti, as it was one of the least spicy options. The food portion was definitely more than enough, and very filling for me. Only took about 10 minutes to complete the order. It was quite delicious! It is so fragrant and flavourful. Really wish they gave more meat portions though!

If you're coming with a group of friends, don't come here. There is only seating for about 4-5 people. It is a very small space, and can feel tight and claustrophobic (especially in the summer)! Everytime I've come here, I had to do take-out because there seats were all full.

I would recommend this place if you want a quiet place to eat out by yourself or with a friend. Great place to grab a quick meal and go."}
{"text":"Mutton Roll! Mutton Roll!! 

I could eat it all day, these guys do not skimp on the spice and make it as it's supposed to be. We even ordered the Kothu Roti but it was the Mutton Roll that stole my heart. 

I will definitely be back for more.

PS: The service is really good, the guy behind the counter was all smiles!"}
{"text":"Tried the Curry Lamb Kothu Roti for lunch yesterday and dang! Delicious. Thought my South Asian had prepared me well for the spices (haha!) but I should've kept it mild. It was hot! In a crazy delicious way! This was a first for me as I went on reviews and it was a good first try. 

The lamb was perfectly tender and the veggies were well done. Generous portion too! Will be going again! Definitely recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a Kotthu roti place after trying it in Manhattan, and this place is my new favourite joint. The Kotthu roti was delicious, spicy and flavourful. The cashier was happy to explain the dishes. The only downside is that it's a tiny spot so seating is hit or miss, but otherwise definitely a place worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Delicious food (doesn't shy away from the spice!) - great value - generous portion size - not expensive - friendly staff. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"I went at around 6pm on a Thursday and had their vegetable roll since they ran out of vegetarian samosas. The filling was tasty, and the roll itself was crispy, but it was barely warm. They need a better oven! If you come here for samosas or their veggie roll, make sure it's hot, or maybe ask them to heat it up for you!"}
{"text":"I got one of their combos this time. It cost around $10, and was originally a 1 meat and 1 vegetable item with rice, but I subbed the rice for palak paneer, having it with chana masala and chicken tikka masala. The medium spice on the chicken was fine, but the sauce to meat ratio was a bit too high. Otherwise, the palak paneer and chana masala were great. So grateful for the server for substituting out the rice!"}
{"text":"The roti is interesting: the bread/wrap is all chopped up into the ingredients. It's a bit too oily and kinda bland. The samosas and other fried pastries were gross--I would not recommend those at all.

It's better to do take out because the only seats are the bar counters at the wall, so plan accordingly.

Overall it was alright, but there are so many better options in the area that I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time after reading all the great reviews. Delicious food, very favourable and fresh. Highly recommended as a fast food and takeout option!"}
{"text":"The true test of a good kothu roti - does it still taste good the next day? Lo and behold, Saffron Spice's kothu roti passes the test! I ordered the vegetarian kothu roti without egg, and for about $10 the portion size was enough to last me two small-sized meals. You can tell that the roti is fresh here because it's nice and soft, and seasoned with a variety of vegetables including okra, onion, and seasonal picks. I don't know if it compares to what you'd get in Scarborough, but if you live downtown this is definitely a solid choice for a quick meal!

Point to note though - order one spice level higher than you normally would. I ordered the medium spice, but I would say it was more of a mild. 

Why not 5 stars? I wish they served their kothu roti with raita!"}
{"text":"I've only gotten delivery from this place, but the butter chicken kothu was delicious! The eggplan curry and the wrap was good too. The size of the kothu is definitely more than satisfying. Would definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, not great. Delivery took over an hour and a half (we live about 10 blocks away), and was warm but not hot when it arrived. Delivery guy apologized and made excuses and offered a 10% off coupon that is already available online to anyone."}
{"text":"I fell upon this place while walking down Queen West in hopes to find a decent place to grab a quick bite and boy, was I surprised at how good it was. I've now gone back a number of times and have tried the various kothu roti dishes - which, by the way, I can't find another place that makes it so I just keep coming back. I think the lamb kothu roti is my favourite but they're all so good. I was entirely unfamiliar with Sri Lankan cuisine and now I'm hooked. Everything was fresh and the gentleman working there was really cool and generous. Food's made to order and portions are great. If you're looking for a quick, satisfying lunch or dinner, check this place out - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant from the khotu fest I went to earlier this year. They had the longest line and ended up running of meat! So I decided to make note of their location and give them a try... 

Fast forward a month or so later, I got an opporjtkty to try them out at their location. There is no dedicated parking, you just need to park where you find a spot on the street. 

We got a couple Mutton Rolls and a medium spicy lamb khotu roti. The rolls were a big disappointment... They were more like potato Rolls.. Barely any mutton. Thumbs down here. 

We had high expectations for the lamb khotu - and were disappointed here as well! There wasn't enough flavor in my opinion, and the spiciness wasn't there (even though we got medium). I really want to say I'd give this place another shot sometime, but that is highly unlikely as the food just didn't leave us wanting more."}
{"text":"Picked up the Lamb Kothu roti to go for dinner which I really enjoyed. It came to $10 and change and it's more than enough food for two meals. They have a pretty good selection of veg and meat curries to choose from, all served with rice and they also have specials available. You also get to choose your spice from mild, medium or hot. It's a small joint, there's a couple seats available if you're staying for a quick bite, otherwise it's mostly a take out joint. The service is quick and friendly. I'll be stopping by again to check out their curry and roti dishes."}
{"text":"This place serves amazing wholesome tasty food!
Lentil and veges are my favourite. The meats are good too. I can't handle the spice of their famous kothu Roti, but it smells amazing and I'm told it's legit!!
Lovely staff, always quick and helpful after a rough day of work, when all you want is nourishing tasty food!"}
{"text":"I could eat this food every day. I'm a big fan of roti, and indian food. This was a easy choice for me, it smelled good from the outside, it was near where i was staying.

This is a small place with only about 10-12 bar stool type seats around the place, definitely more of a quick pick type place.

I'm not sure what we ended up ordering because everything looked and smelled so good, enough said that we scoffed it all way faster that we expected, friendly people behind the counter. The roti was hot (temp) and we got ours spicy it did not disappoint. If you haven't tried it, don't wait any longer, you are missing out."}
{"text":"Not your typical Sri Lankan restaurant for sure. The kottu roti is quite different than what you would typically find in Scarborough/Markham. Went with a group of friends and we all tried different things (Spicy Chicken,Butter Chicken, and Seafood Special Kottu Roti). Food comes in a small box and is accompanied with the traditional limes. Large amount of food but the price is higher than what you would typically pay for Kottu Roti. However, from my knowledge this is probably the only Sri Lankan restaurant on Queen Street so it makes sense for the price variance. The place is very small so its not expected that you dine-in but there are a few chairs if you choose to stay. Food is really fresh and it is probably a good place to introduce to Non-Sri Lankans for the first time as the spice level is not that hot (you can always ask for hotter if you like). If your feeling like something different and have a spicy tooth in downtown, definitely recommend trying this spot."}
{"text":"OMG the kothu roti, tho!
It's so delicious, chopped up, decent portion that could last for one meal and a snack, well not for me, it's too yummy, I devour it in one sitting. I've never had the lamb one, only the chicken one, but I will try the lamb one soon. 
It's not great for sitting, there's a small spot by the window, but it's more of a quick lunch or takeout place. 
It's quick, too. Def check it out."}
{"text":"Tried it once, and found a long nasty hair in my food. will never eat from this place again."}
{"text":"This was my first go at Sri Lankan food in the downtown core, and I'm very impressed! I'm a little surprised as they don't seem to advertise the fact that kothu is a Sri Lankan dish, but it's basically like the poutine of Sri Lanka...but more people actually eat it for a meal than we devour poutine as a meal here. And like poutine, it is also the perfect post-2am food to have, being incredibly flavourful and filling. 

The price point of around $10 for 1 kothu is higher than I would have expected, but not too surprising given it's location of Queen and Spadina. But service was friendly and quick for something made on the spot. 

I had 2 kouthu's (chicken and lamb) to go for a friend's house party and it was very well received by all present. I personally preferred the lamb since the chicken one was made using Chicken Tikka, I guess trying to appear familiar to the crowds here? And they seem to have super cheap samosa's too (but some reviews here make me a little hesitant of checking those out). 

But if you're looking for something you've likely not had before (or maybe even heard of) I highly recommend checking out Saffron and ordering their kothu.
Pro tip: it's much better spicy than bland."}
{"text":"As a fellow Srilankan, I can vouch for the authenticity of the kothu roti here. Is there better kothu roti/ Sri Lankan food in Scarborough? - yes of course there is. But for what it is (a Srilankan restaurant located in the heart of t.dot), this place is wonderful!

We had the tandoori wrap and spicy chicken kothu roti, and thoroughly enjoyed every last bite. I would recommend getting the chicken kothu roti or the lamb kothu roti, if you are looking for the \"authentic\" Srilankan Taste."}
{"text":"At my first try, I thought this place was just so so, but after a few more visit, i found this became one of my favourite  lunch restaurant! I like their dry chicken(forgot the name), eggplant, potato."}
{"text":"I got a pick up for Ritual so there wasn't much customer service so I can't comment on that. 

I got the Butter Chicken and Brussel Sprouts and Carrots.  The food wasn't for me.  It was bland and I think I've had much better Indian food in Scarborough.  In addition,  the bottom of the takeout container was filled with curry and it stained my white table.  

So basically I'm not coming back. Sorry :("}
{"text":"I have tried Kottu roti at many places but this one is a winner! I'm so glad that this one is in downtown and such a convenient location too.  It's a small place and but don't get fooled by the size, lot of people do takeout but I can tell you one thing that kottu roti taste the best when you eat it fresh, their spice levels are great and I like mine spicy. The best combo is hot kottu roti and mango lassi! I wish I found this place earlier."}
{"text":"This is really a takeout place, but they do have a few seats open and you can sit and eat by the window. I had an assortment of three veggie dishes for 9.95 and it was delicious and a very good value."}
{"text":"Ordered an extra spicy chicken kothu roti and got the most bland kothu roti I have ever had and the chicken was so hard to find, would never order from here again"}
{"text":"So the owner is getting smart asking how you want your kothu roti...he had explained that I like it more traditional when I describe it.  So here's how to order it..if you want to try it this way
1.   more roti than veggies (my last one was too veggie heavy)
2.  some spices but not too hot/spicy.  He added spices (the last one didn't have added)
3.  lime to squeeze on top.
was purrrfect this time! so that's 2x in a row..looking good...consistency is important too!"}
{"text":"The kothu roti was really awesome and tasty! We also had the combo with tikka masala chicken- that's was awesome too. Shared between 2 people and we couldn't walk from all the food that was served!!! Definitely will go back there for sure!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time , kothu lamb Roti was yummy not too spicy but not mild either , the  cut up roti reminded me oddly of Pad Thai noodles. Next time I will eat there or nearby,  I think travelling with it straight off the grill steaming in its package might have made it a bit mushier, it was still good. Tried the eggplant and will go back for that for sure. The various veggie options were very good. Not the best samosas."}
{"text":"Loved the chilly chicken kothu! Def recommend. They ordered for my friends 30th bday."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place. I checked the website and it clearly said they open at 11am. I got there at 11:05am. It was closed. Somewhat miffed I decided to stay in the neighborhood and ran some errands and got back at 11:30am. It was closed.

This place clearly has no respect for their customer's time and the fact that I traveled to their location twice. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Literally a hole in the wall - very limited seating (most customers pickup and go), minimal furnishings, a lot of broken bar stools, no waiter service.  But amazing VALUE for the amount and quality of food you're getting! The flavors here do not pale in comparison to sit-down Indian restaurants nearby, i.e. Little India. They have many vegetarian and vegan options here, as well as decent looking meat dishes. I came here for lunch on a Saturday recently and got a combo with rice + 3 vegetarian options. Spent around $10 for what was a huge portion of food (couldn't finish in 1 meal). I saw another pair of customers (2 guys) buy 1 lunch combo and share. That's how much food you're getting. I don't like how the rice to vegetable/meat ratio is heavy skewed towards more rice/carbs - ran out of toppings long before I made a significant dent in the rice."}
{"text":"Their kothu roti is one of the best I have had in the GTA. I have tried at least 5 other places this year.

I had the butter chicken kothu roti, which is not a typical flavour for this dish, but was delicious all the same. 

This is more of a take out joint, with limited seating.

I wish there had been more meat in the dish."}
{"text":"Did an uber eats order so can't speak to the dine in experience, however the portions and food were great. Order included two combos (ends up being a lot of rice, two people could probably do one combo and one main with the amount of rice in a combo) 
Tried the Chana (excellent) 
Butter Chicken (very good)
Red Dal (okay)
Palek Panner (very good) 
Lamb curry (can't recall the name sorry) excellent
Also reheated leftovers and still really tasty (which also indicates some sizeable portions) looking forward to another order to try the Roti options too!!"}
{"text":"A great find on Queen Street!  Excellent flavor in both the chicken kothu-roti and chicken tikka masala.  The owner was very helpful in explaining the menu and making sure to make the order mild.  I was apprehensive from other reviews to go for medium.   However, for me, mild was too mild.  Will order medium next time, for an extra kick in flavor and heat!"}
{"text":"The Kothu roti is outstanding. Especially seafood (it's white fish). The Kothu rivals any pricey Indian restaurant I've been to but for a way cheaper price. The staff is super cool and friendly. It takes a bit of time to get your food but that's because everything is made really fresh. I love this place."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.
The roti are quite good. Classic Sri Lankan spice profile, good combination of flavors, especially with a squeeze of the lemon. 

Other food I tried was solidly mediocre. Samosas aren't great, nor was the sambar."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in downtown. My go to place whenever I couldn't  bring lunch from home.  So far I have tried their lunch boxes with rice/meat/veggies, kothu roti, mutton rolls, chicken briyani, chicken wrap and indian milk tea. Everything is a 5 star. The taste is just amazing. You  could vary spice level for kothu roti and their spicy is really spicy. They are in ritual and they honor the order timings very much. Even walking to this place and placing order is good, in and out 10 minutes tops. This is a takeout place and seating is very limited."}
{"text":"Small, very, very small. So small that they looked at us like we were crazy for wanting to eat there.
I asked for a taste of masala & butter sauces. He grabbed spoons by the part you put in your mouth without gloves and dipped each into the sauces. YUCK! I was shocked and horrified but couldn't unsee what just happened and felt committed at that point so we stayed.
The chicken tikka masala was ok.  The butter chicken was ridiculously hot. No options for different heat levels of sauces. When we asked for mild butter, we were told to pick another sauce (masala). Naan was bread. Certainly not the clay oven naan that I love. 
This place is ok. Just ok. 
Call me a fat American but for the $25 for 2 small meals, we both agreed that we should've gone to a buffet."}
{"text":"I had their Mulligatawny soup (curried soup with chicken, red lentils, celery, carrots, potatoes & basmati rice), which came with a veggie samosa, and it was delicious! Perfect level of spice and the ingredients to soup ratio was just right. It was filling and came to just under $8. Ordered it via Ritual and was intoxicated by the smells when I went to pick it up. Can't wait to go back and make my way through the menu!"}
{"text":"The pluses

The portions of the dishes with roti really are big!! Yay!  It's refreshing to see bigger portions for less than $10 CAD still available at downtown take aways.  There seems to be a good variety of dishes.  The roti really is good value for money.

The cons

Unfortunately, Saffron spice kitchen is one of those places where *mild != no hot spice*:

The curry dishes are all spicy :(  I asked the guy whether the butter chicken was spicy and he said no, it was mild.  For me, anything with \"hot\" spice is spicy.  I don't like hotsauce at all in general, or any \"hot spices\" in my food as it kills all the natural subtle flavours.  The butter chicken flavour was kind of killed by the spicyness for me.  If you're someone that doesn't like spicy dishes, you're probably best to avoid this place.  Or at least all the curry dishes, as well as the roti dishes that get \"mild\" curry sauce poured over them."}
{"text":"MUST TRY:
Lamb Kothu Roti

The menu is small. I like how they focus on a few things and do them well. 

Lamb kothu roti comes with a good portion. Looks a bit like a box of poutine at first. Best for sharing between 2 people.

Kothu Roti is similar to Char Kway Teow. It is a stirfry, consisting of bits of roti (similar texture to rice noodles) and egg, meat, onion, cabbage, spices, and other vegetables.

It's fast and delicious!

{"text":"Tried out Saffron for the first time last year. I had their curry chicken kothu roti but I was not the biggest fan.. I remember it tasting kinda rubbery. 

Nevertheless, I wanted to give this place a second chance. I decided to give it another shot at lunch today and ordered a medium spice, vegetarian kothu roti for pickup and it was so bomb. They topped it with a bit of chana masala, peas and beets - which were actually a great touch. I would say one order is approximately two portions (depending on how much you eat of course) but I devoured it all in one sitting (wouldn't recommend doing this - I'm feeling so sleepy and drowsy at the moment).

I've had a couple of samosas from here as well but tbh I would skip those and go straight for the kothu rotis. Yum!"}
{"text":"My favourite place to get lunch in the neighbourhood. I often have a hard time picking between the roti and combos but I always get the eggplant!"}
{"text":"- Lamb Kothu roti ($13 after tax): very flavourful and lots of spices I would say. This is the first time I tried kothu roti, these thinned roti slices in this dish tasted just like noodles lol. They gave good amount of meat and veggies. My bf and I shared this dish we were both so full in the end. 
- Mango lassi ($3.33 after tax): it tastes like mango slush with yogurt added, went pretty well with the food. 
- Portion: generous, recommend to share with someone else because the kothu roti might get boring as you eat 
- Price: pretty cheap even though a box is more than $10, but it can be shared between two people"}
{"text":"Sent the completely wrong order on Uber eats. Won't answer their phone either. And whatever dishes they sent (I can't even tell)  was horrid."}
{"text":"I randomly dropped by here on a Sunday stroll and got the apparently famous chicken tikka kothu roti in spicy and honestly I cannot believe I haven't come here more often. This was my first time having a kothu roti and I honestly didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't like a typical roti wrap and I love the chewiness the cut up roti had mixed in with everything. The level of spice was also on point, but I'd say I have a higher tolerance for spice than the average. The mixture of all the flavours was also so good and for a decent price as well. Not to mention, the service was really great. The guy seemed to really care about our experience of the food and asked if it was to our liking, which I thought was super sweet of him. The only thing is, the space is quite tight and there's very few seating so I'd definitely come back here for takeout."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure what I was eating but it was delicious. Ordered the tandoori chicken kothu roti. Amazing value, friendly service and tasty food. I got two full meals out of it! Only downside was I asked for really spicy, and I was given an extra spicy sauce and I didn't even detect a hint of spice. But I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Very good food for a decent price. The khotu especially is fantastic. Great service as well."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch or dinner takeout. They make a kothu roti that isn't greasy and has a lot of veggies compared to traditional fare so it's great for lunch. Their lunch combos are generally what I get from here and it's a good deal with drink included. Tasty too."}
{"text":"Yummm.

I ordered the chicken tikka kothu roti from the friendly staff for $11.24. My plan was to get it to go, hop on the streetcar, and then eat it at home. The kothu roti had other plans... It gave off an aroma that screamed \"I AM UNBELIEVABLY FLAVOURFUL. EAT ME NOW.\" So I did. It was absolutely delicious and lived up to the aroma.

Best part was that I got to annoy a racist guy on the streetcar who started scowling when he smelled the food, and went on to use a racial slur at me for just sitting there silently and eating. The magical kothu roti blocked his ugly vibes and I continued to eat, unbothered. I guess some people don't like seasoning... Sucks for y'all. 

The portion was so generous that it provided me with lunch the next day too :) Yay!"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious, conveniently located on queen street. Food was made to order but I wish there was more seating as only about 6 stools present."}
{"text":"Just order delivery from this place and so happy with it. We ordered two of the combos and they were delivered fresh, hot and delicious. The curries were a bit on the spicier side which I really enjoy. It's a good amount of food, high quality for the price and very filling. Will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Wish I had discovered this place sooner. I am a big fan of veg combo it comes 4 items and they rotate different items, which allows you to have a great variety. So far I liked everything I have tried. Very impressed with the spinach paneer very flavorful and the texture is to my liking not pureed like baby food. I have also tried eggplant, cauliflower, potato and mango lassi ... everything taste super fresh and they seems to have that magical ingredient in there food ---Love. I will definitely come back and try more delicious curries."}
{"text":"These guys have done a great job of making Indian takeout accessible. You're not going to get exquisite gourmet, but you will get honest food made fresh (at least every time i've been there). In fact, i'd take some of their dishes over some of the so called \"gourmet\" Indian restaurants in Toronto. 

They are reasonably priced, and their portion sizes are impressive. My large Kothu Roti was enough to feed at least two people. The owner/staff is also very friendly, and is helpful in explaining the dishes if you're not too familiar with Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Second time trying Saffron Spice in a long long time. My friends and I were debating on where to go with a plethora of foodie spots in the area we choose Saffron.

Open-ish kitchen environment. Small blueprint but seating is available for around 6 max. Menu was straight forward classic kothu roti with various proteins, wraps, curry options, and some small appetizers. 

I ordered the seafood kothu roti, something new for me, and as usual got the spice level at hot. Overall I was pleased with the presentation. A variety of different veggies were included such as cauliflower. The roti was moist, definitely was not old. And the overall curry went well. Despite getting hot the spice wasn't enough ( well for me .... ), the staff provided a generous amount of in house hot sauce which really kicked things up. If you like spice would recommend asking for it. 

My only problem was that there wasn't enough seafood. In this case salmon. I was literally searching through the box, the salmon to roti ratio wasn't sufficient. Whatever salmon I did get, tasted good. Well seasoned and flaked apart with the fork. Surprisingly salmon tastes good with curry and roti. For what you pay wasn't enough, better getting the other options. 

My friends were satisfied with their butter chicken kothu, chicken kothu, and curry chicken wrap. We went home stuffed with some leftovers. Overall we were happy with the ingredients, concept, and just the freshness of the food. 

If your accustomed to the typical circular aluminum tray kothu rotis of the GTA you may not be estatic with Saffron, but would still recommend a try for the variety. For the general public its a great option especially for the area, foods fresh, and the flavors are there. 

3.5 out of 5 for me."}
{"text":"Staff was really friendly. It was our first time in this restaurant and lunch was served with Great food. Very nice. It tasted like home made food. If you wanna eat full lunch in no time this is the best place to go for it. Amazing food... must eat here if u r looking for homemade food when away from home."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the kothu roti at Saffron Spice Kitchen.  Every time I visit I'm impressed with the flavour and texture, and just how filling it is.  I think I only every finished the entire portion once, usually I have to tap out halfway through, or at most three quarters of the way.  As others have mentioned, it also tastes great the next day!

The location is pretty convenient to access, and they are available on multiple delivery/takeout services, like Ritual, UberEats, Foodora, DoorDash and the like.  Prices also seem pretty reasonable for downtown Toronto.

They've made an effort to dress up the interior, and it looks nice, but this is a takeout place at the end of the day.  I have to take off points for the limited seating area, and those stools that sink when you sit on them.  Be aware there are no restrooms either."}
{"text":"Inauthentic soggy kothu roti. Mutton rolls are really potato rolls! I asked if they have goat kothu roti, and the worker claimed that it is hard to get goat meat in the West! If u want kothu roti, go to kothu kada in Markham. I would gladly give negative stars for saffron spice kitchen, if possible!!!"}
{"text":"Good cheap food. We had a group of seven Sri Lankan guys visiting from the US and we all had different things but everyone said their food was good."}
{"text":"The first time that we went here we had an amazing experience. The guy at the counter was very nice and recommended items and the food was amazing. Hence we decided to return. Despite this, our second time wasn't as good: although the food was great, the portions that we received were FAR less than last time. For example, I ordered the butter chicken with 1 side and only received 4 pieces of butter chicken. 4 small pieces. My bf ordered the Madras Chicken and wasent even asked about any sides. When my bf reminded the guy at the counter that he wanted a side with his meat the guy at the counter said he already packed it and that my bf had to order it separately. Furthermore, he also got WAY less food than last time. We were very disappointed.
We weren't even asked what spice level we wanted..."}
{"text":"Ordered the butter chicken kothu roti.... the favor is just okay, it is basically this mass of unrecognizable mashed stuff.. which is just kind of chewy and not appealing. On top of that is a small spoonful of chicken pieces (3 small pieces..or probably more like 2.5 pieces) and a little butter chicken sauce. 
After 3-5 bites you start to wonder what each piece of stuff you're picking up with your fork..then you stare at it and try to taste what it is.. and you still don't know. Then you feel confused and unsatisfied because the flavor is not great and you guess it's probably just another piece of minced roti."}
{"text":"This place was the worst place ever. The kothu roti did not even taste like the authentic srilankan kothu roti. It lacked mutton peices and the quantity was too small for $11.50.
Will never be coming back!"}
{"text":"This newly opened take away place was a revelation. Excellent, fresh, tasty and spicy indian food and in hearty portions. Johnne and Victor run a neat kitchen and bring along their enthusiasm and love for indian food to this place that made the lunch all the more memorable. The veggie rice combo mix was delicious. And the chicken biryani yummy. Am definitely heading back for more!"}
{"text":"It was Boxing day in Toronto (essentially Canada's Black Friday) and my fiancee and I just touched down. It was 9:00pm at night and we walked from Union Station to our hotel in 10 degree weather (dying). After settling in, we decided we were hungry and found this spot open and decided to go. We have never had kothu roti which is what brought us here so it's difficult to say \"Meh, I've experienced better\" but we weren't too impressed overall. 

We ended up going with the butter chicken kothu roti (medium spice), a samosa, water, and a mango lassi. For the price (~$11 CAD), the kothu roti was quite dense. Flavor wise, I wish we would have went spicier. Perhaps they were holding back but I didn't find kothu roti to be anything special. The samosa was even blander and was kind of cold when we ate it and the lassi was decent. All in all, wasn't too impressed and not sure if I would come back if I was living in Toronto."}
{"text":"I ordered Sri Lankan rice and curry platter. It was delicious. Finally found authentic Sri Lankan food in Toronto. 
Delivery was efficient and quick. Delivered to my office downtown within 20 mins. Definitely ordering again!"}
{"text":"I was stealing wifi from a nearby friend's office when we decided it was lunch time. Luuunch time. Time for lunch. Out of our way. 

We called in a take out order to Saffron Spice Kitchen, a place he was familiar with but I had passed without noticing many times. I had the butter chicken roti bowl (I forget what they actually call it) and a soup. The mulligatawny was delicious, and my box of deconstructed roti was also good. It wasn't as cheap of a lunch as I'd hoped, but there were tons of leftovers and the flavours were fresh and spicy. 

Lastly, I leave you with this ol' gem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upclJMOnlSs"}
{"text":"First time having this type of dish (butter chicken kothu roti)...most disappointing thing I've had all year. Threw away the leftovers instead of finishing even though I was still hungry. Not good."}
