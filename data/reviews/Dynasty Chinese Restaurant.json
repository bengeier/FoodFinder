{"text":"Although the food wasn't too bad. The service was the worst I have ever experienced.  Waiting an hour past the promised time for pick up and even then got the order wrong.  When a call was placed to complain the \"owner\" argued with me that she was right and was quite rude.. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I've just ordered from this restaurant, for the 2nd time.  After doing a Google search for reviews on Chinese Restaurants (that deliver) in Richmond Hill, I came across Dynasty & took a look at the reviews.  The reviews were awesome, so I decided to give them a try!  The lady that answered the phone, both last time and this time, is so sweet & friendly (thanks you after every item ordered :) LOL).  The food was delivered quickly, is VERY reasonably priced (in comparison to other Chinese restaurants) and, I have to say, one of the best tasting I've ever had.  Even my husband, who is NOT a huge Chinese food fan, agreed.  Tonight's order was my second, but it will DEFINITELY not be my last!!"}
{"text":"The staffs are very friendly, and the food is good. I like the asparagus sizzling plate and also the soup that I ordered which is a chicken corn soup."}
{"text":"FOOD (Delivery)
For take out food, we ordered the special for 2 and pan fried meat dumplings. The food was pretty tasty overall. I wasn't too pleased with the dumplings. If they fried it longer where the skin is crunchy, it would've tasted a lot better. The dumplings were freshly boiled so there were still a lot of water in the container and the skin was soaking. I won't be ordering this again. 

PACKAGING
The fried chicken ball was packed in the cardboard box which is great bc they were still crunchy when they were delivered. Everything else like the fried rice, chicken suey, and pan fried dumplings were packed in plastic containers. I personally prefer the plastic containers - healthier choice of packaging compare to the white styrofoam. 

DELIVERY
Delivery over $25-$30 (I believe) and the food got here in 30mins after the order was placed over the phone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really like this place! Food is great, value is great, service is great. Really friendly lady at the front counter, she's helpful and sweet."}
{"text":"After hearing many great reviews of Dynasty 2 on Nextdoor, my husband and I decided to give this place a try. It's a pleasant bike ride from where we live nearby. The service was extremely prompt and attentive from the moment we walked in the door and our food was delicious. It was also very reasonably priced (the lunch menu as well I noticed) and the portions generous. I've never written a review for Yelp before but we were so pleasantly surprised with a lovely evening that I felt this place deserved a great review. We will definitely be back (or we'll order delivery) and were so happy to have such a great place in the neighborhood. They've only been there two months so they don't have Koi in the unique, cool little fountain area in the dining room yet but I'm very excited to see them in future!"}
{"text":"I don't know if the food is good, it's been more than an hour since we ordered. They kept hanging up when we called to find out the status of our order. When they finally answered we were given the run around an HOUR AND A HALF after we ordered. \"Oh yeah, the driver just left.\" We'll see..."}
{"text":"Whenever you don't feel like cooking, this is a great back up plan. I am not sure how the price compares to other Chinese takeout restaurants. The food never disappoints. The only irritating element is the waiting. it is better to order in advance before you get there. If you don't order ahead on a Saturday then you can be waiting for a good while."}
{"text":"The delivery is fast about 30 minutes and the food is very good and always hot the dynasty chicken is great and the black pepper sizzling beef is awesome the salt and pepper calamari is delicious. I highly recommend delivery bar far the best Chinese food in madison"}
{"text":"Have been ordering from here for a couple of months. Delicious and fresh tasting food at the owner, Kelly, is a sweetheart! Absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Half a star.
It's nice that some yelpers went out of their way to try and keep this place in business but that strategy just cost me 33 bucks. I'd rather a real Chinese restaurant take this location and give the area an option.
Where do I begin? How about the packaged MSG laden broth for the Wonton Soup that is currently giving me a headache.
Or how about the lemon chicken that had more soggy breading than chicken?
Or perhaps it's the dry Szechuan shredded beef I asked to have extra spicy that turned out to be 85% onions and peppers in an oily terrible sauce that had no spice.
Maybe the owner can come online an explain to me what was \"Dry\" about this dish? I expected something crispy.
The fried rice had half of the grains still white and there was no flavour.
This place has been here way too long, don't you find it interesting after all these years there isn't one pic of their food on yelp?
In my 43 years of eating Chinese food I have NEVER TASTED WORSE.

STAY AWAY YELPERS AND IF THE OWNER IS LISTENING YOU SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED TO PUT YOUR NAME ON THIS PRODUCT."}
{"text":"Amazing food, fast and fresh. Incredible service. One of the best Chinese restaurants in the GTA."}
{"text":"It's relatively not expensive and good food. Someone should try the salt and pepper pork chop"}
{"text":"Visiting from New York and my meal at Dynasty was fantastic! Comparable to the best food in NYC's Chinatown. Portions were large, vegetables were so fresh, service was personal (by the owner Sonny), and soda refills were free. The design of the restaurant is really something to see - there is a section with an authentic Chinese rock garden display. Beautiful Chinese music was soflty playing in the background. Restrooms were immaculate. There is easy on and off from the highway and it sure beats dealing with the downtown scene. It is a real family style restaurant and the kids will love it. Congrats to Sonny!

{"text":"Food is fresh and delivery is SO fast, especially if you live in the Richmond hill area. The woman who takes your order on the phone is AWESOME :) 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Chinese Restaurant, the food is mouth watering; just thinking about their cashew chicken, or their szechuan fried noodles. They also sell the best hot & sour soup I have ever tasted.

Kelly is a Gem all on her own, the most positive, upbeat person I've ever met, always remembering every customer by name, and putting a smile on our faces, so Thank You, Kelly for you and your delicious, mouth-watering food."}
{"text":"Opened in March, I have dined in with a friend for lunch and taken carryout dinners for my husband and I at least five times.  
Big for us is no MSG used in any of their food as my husband is very allergic to it.
The food has never been overcooked in any of the several dishes we have tried.  Portions are ample and the food is really, really tasty.  My husband loves the egg rolls.
Service is fast and friendly.
Delivery is available in an eight mile radius.
Liquor license is applied for and pending.
Give this restaurant a try.  I think you will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. Food is great and always fresh. A couple of friends of mine were talking and the conversation came up about there. We all was impressed with the staff there how professional and polite they were and was eager to help if we needed it. Plus the amount of food you get is shocking. I'm not a small guy. I can eat. I get full off the amount of food you get. It just makes you wanna go back all the time. Definitely will recommend this place a lot. If you hungry this is the place to go!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered through EatStreet, and I was glad to find a Chinese restaurant that delivered in Fitchburg with such a variety on the menu. However, the results were mixed to poor. Everything arrived early but cold, which I'm not surprised by whenever I order delivery, unfortunately. 

I enjoyed the salt and pepper calamari most of the dishes I ordered. The walnut shrimp tasted bitter and metallic, very unpleasant. The shrimp egg rolls were tiny, finger-sized in diameter, but tasty. The fried wontons were, weirdly, just flat, fried squares of wonton, no filling, which made them highly overpriced. 

I had ordered enough that I hoped to get two meals out of it, but since I'm throwing both the shrimp and dough squares away, I won't have enough leftovers to make another meal. I'm not sure I'll order again. I saw some other dishes I wanted to try, but this experience was so mixed that I'll have to be willing to gamble."}
{"text":"Fabulous gem on the Beltline. Fresh made food with quality ingredients.  I had a sizzling platter with BBQ pork, chick and prawns that was delicious.  Large slices of pork, perfectly cooked.  The seaweed tofu soup was tasty as well.  Definitely coming back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time last night heard it was good....
We ordered 8 dishes at a decent price of $74
If your looking for a greasy Asian food to cure ur hangover this is your go to. The food is not traditional Asian food and extremely oily. Many of the dishes tasted the same which was a sweet soy sauce. The only good dish was the sweet and spicy pork chop bites. Delicious but also greasy. 
Delivery was fast considering the amount of food we ordered. 
They load you up on fortune cookies which are tasty and have good fortunes lol"}
{"text":"I've been going to Dynasty for 4 or 5 years. Not only is the food good (my personal favorites are the Cantonese chow mein, the BBQ pork chunks with the ingredient fried rice, and the honey garlic spare ribs), the customer service of the owner, Kelly, is impeccable. When I come back from university and call to place an order, she instantly recognizes my voice and calls me by name, although there's usually a 6 to 12 month gap between my orders."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 10 years. Kelly and her husband are always welcoming and happy to see their customers. Never had an issue in any visit, takeout or sit down. Food is always fresh, tasty and great portions. The place is nothing amazing on the inside (think classic diner) but their lunch specials are great value. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to anyone looking for GREAT Chinese food in Richmond Hill. Much tastier than their competitors."}
{"text":"There are a lot of Chinese restaurants in Richmond Hill but not that many in the residential area north of Major Mackenzie.

When we lived near Bathurst and Elgin Mills we often drove to Markham because the restaurants on Hwy 7 have parking issues.  Until we discovered a tiny whole in the wall of a restaurant called Dynasty.

In a strip mall on Major Mackenzie beside a Macs store and beauty salon is this hidden gem.

The wife of the couple, Kelly (Her Canadianized name) is a sweet lady who makes me laugh when I order by phone because she always asks anything else?  It makes me think of the scene from Dude, where's my car?  Where the Chinese drive thru lady keeps saying And then?  But I digress...

The star dish here, if you like a bit of heat, is the House Special Spicy Beef.  Tender beef in a rich and spicy sauce that is unlike any beef dish we've ever had, and it's stir fried with snow peas and onions.  It's the house special for a reason!

They also make amazing dumplings aka pot stickers, the best I've tasted since we were in San Francisco 20 years ago.  The filling of pork, ginger, garlic, and other perfectly blended seasonings makes it so tasty!  

They also make my favourite kind of old school egg rolls with bean sprouts not cabbage.

The place is small so sometimes it can take time to get a bigger order ready, but there are only 2 places I make sure to pick up take out from when near Richmond Hill - chicken souvlaki in a pita from Joe's burgers and Chinese food from Dynasty.  

We left a menu with a note for the family who bought our house in Richmond Hill, they made sure to email us and tell us they appreciated the recommendation and are now regulars.

A great mom and pop spot for a blend of Canadian style Chinese food.  If you are lucky enough to live near Bathurst and Major Mackenzie in Richmond Hill, give it a try!

Tell them Lisa and Mr. Grant sent you... Yes, my hubby's first name is Grant and she calls him Mister Grant, how adorable is that??!!"}
{"text":"After moving boxes and furniture all day, my girlfriend and I were famished. We quickly looked up all the food places nearby that were still serving food at 3 PM and found this establishment. After we ordered, the food came out quickly. We ordered the general tso, salt and pepper pork and beef lo mein - they were delicious and exactly what we wanted. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had lunch again at Dynasty two days ago - Szechuan prawns.  Delicious.  Heat is to taste - Sonny, the owner,  asked how hot I wanted it, and I said I preferred medium heat, which it was.  The combination appetizer plate was also very tasty - my favorites were the fried dumplings and prawns.  Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Great food.
Everything was freshly made.
Vegetables were bought at local farmers market.

Everything was extremely tasty. 

All menu items are made to order."}
{"text":"A new Chinese Restaurant in a former Chinese site. Excellent food, excellent service and expansive menu. Sonny, the owner, immediately makes you feel at home. 
Certainly it should become a neighborhood favorite but given its location near the Beltline everyone should be able to access it. 
My favorites: shrimp rolls, moo shu pork, sizzling beef and hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"Very disappointing :/ My meal was not only incorrect but the lo mein tasted spoiled. I requested egg be added to my sweet and spicy tofu and did not get it. Also half of the egg roll was empty and the other half had half a shrimp and two pieces of cabbage as thin as shredded lettuce. I had it delivered and the only way to get my $30.00 refund was for me to drive to the restaurant (20 minutes before they closed) because they refused to send a delivery driver to come pick up the food and would not give a refund unless they had the food. I was very pleasant when I called the store and although they apologized they were unwilling to provide me with what I feel is good customer service and standard policy for how messed up delivery's should be handled. I am a manager of a restaurant myself and understand mistakes happen and always give out second chances for poor experiences. However I will not be returning here because they did not resolve the issue properly."}
{"text":"Been ordering from here for years. Ask anyone in Richmond Hill about Dynesty and everyone will have nothing but great things to say.  That one guy above giving such a bad review must have had a really bad day. I suggest he try ordering again. 
Kelly is awesome and puts a smile on my face every time I speak to her as she is such a happy positive woman.  Delivery is fast and free. Get the cashew chicken!"}
