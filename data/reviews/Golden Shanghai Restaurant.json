{"text":"I am on the hunt for a good Shanghai food place since Skyland de Shanghai closed. Came here with my boyfriend and my parents for lunch on a Saturday. The meal cost us $40 (expensive by Chinese standards - we all balked when we saw the bill). Service was SUPER slow. Food was average at best. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place to eat but the service and food is awesome! Recommand: Sweet and sour soup. Garlic white pork!    Parking is a little annoying..."}
{"text":"Man, this place is a little gem!! :) we had steamed pork dumplings, hand tear chicken, duck, soup, fried rice... oh man... they are so so yummy.... the lady at the restaurant are very nice... and the recommended the duck to us and it was so young and fresh... if i have a chance, i will go and eat again for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to restaurant for weekend lunches and family dinners. It is also my favourite restaurant in Markham to get my Shanghai food fix. What's special about this place is that it's family owned. The wife takes care of the front while the husband takes care of the kitchen. As such, service could be slow at times because the place could get crazy packed and they don't have enough help to fulfill orders. But, there's a reason for them to be so busy all the time (even on a Tuesday evening, they have a full house!), they have really generous portion for a very reasonably price and taste is also decent.   When I brought my father in-law to dine here, he was literally out of his seat  when he found out how affordable each item costs with the portion size. My family and I love ordering their Clay Pot Veggies ????. The pot is HUGE for only $17.99 and comes with lots of veggies and various dumplings/meat inside a hot, hearty broth. This dish alone is enough to be shared among 3 to 4 people easily.   As mentioned above, one of the cons about this place is that service could be slow sometimes or they might have difficulties fulfilling some orders depending time of day. Another con is that, it's also extremely difficult to find parking in this tiny plaza."}
{"text":"Went to eat Shanghai food. Ordered hot sweet soy bean. Was nice and hot not very sweet just enough.  We also ordered the siu long bao. The wrap is thicker  then what I'm use to but the soup inside the siu long bao was excellent. No oily at all.  We also ordered pan friend dumpling. It was amazing the crunchy texture was perfect. Not too hard and not too soft. The meat and soup inside was great too. Again not too oily.   Last dish we had was the shanghai noodle stir fried with pork and cabbage. In terms of flavor  I think maybe a bit more salt. Love the think noodles kind of reminds me of something like udon.   Will be back again."}
{"text":"I wanted to change things up tonight and decided to order some food on Skip the Dishes. Normally I order a burrito but tonight ordered Chinese. The Griswolds usually like to dine in for Chinese food because it's usually comes hot, fresh and steaming. I've never tried this restaurant so being home and too lazy to go out, and my slippers were comfy on my feet, I ordered in. The food was delivered fast, hot and fresh. I ordered over $20 so there was no delivery charge, just the courier tip. The food was delicious and I like that the entree's weren't hidden in huge pieces of onions and veggies. We ordered the string beans, sautéed chicken, fried rice, spicy chicken balls. They weren't balls, just delicious chunks of chicken lightly breaded in an amazing spicy sauce. The breaded came with no veggies, but the sautéed chicken came with small pieces of celery. Delicious! You gotta eat here! Or order from here. Either way.. you'll like it."}
{"text":"i am a frequent customer.   Soup filled dumpling, hot and sour soup, braised chicken noodles and Shanghai rice cake are my favorites.    It is not a restaurant with nice deco but it is really for good food.  The services are generally good."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant I will come again only if I'm in the area. The fish soup noodle was ok. The pork dumpling was pretty good. The only thing I'm against is when you pay the bill and the waitress bring you back the change and do not say thank you. They really need to learn !!!"}
{"text":"After seeing Jen K's review about a $20 for 2 dinner special, I had to go and try!  The Hot & Sour soup was pretty good and was a big bowl of it for 2 to share,  The steamed pork dumpling was well made, it was very thin, but did not break when you lift it up and there was good amount of filling and soup (6pcs)  spicy minced beef and beans was a good portion and good flavour.  had the general tao chicken, which was just chicken and peanut which also a good size, perfect was 2 people and flavour was good.  The only thing I'm a bit upset about was the waitress who lied to us.  I wanted to try the red bean dough ball dessert which came in 6pcs. (which we obviously could not finish with 2 people, and it doesn't taste good if you don't finish it on the spot, the person I went with would only eat 1 max) I asked if we could just order 2 or 3 pcs. So she says she had to ask someone, ok sure... so she comes back and tells us that they can not make just 2 or 3 cause no one else ordered it, so they can't start a batch. (Ok totally understandable right?) except, as we are still eating our dinner... almost every single table in the restaurant received that dessert! and there was about 5-6 other tables there. If you didn't want to sell it, just say that you must place a whole order. I just don't like seeing wasted food.   It would have been a good experience if she didn't lie to us. it was good value for just enough food for 2 people."}
{"text":"My favourite Shanghai restaurant for a decent price!  This is a family based restaurant, where the wife makes the mantou (bread) and many of the dumplings and sticky rice wrap rolls and the husband does the dishes, service might be a little slow, but really worth it!   They have really cheap lunch and dinner combos (as low as $5-$6) for dumplings and a dish. The quality of the food is delicious. The xiao long bao all have hot soup inside, the sticky rice rolls are often in large enough portions to be divided up into 4 pieces.  I also recommend the crispy duck. Coming here about thirty to fourty times, I always see a few tables order the crispy duck, which is surrounded by handmade mantou. DELICIOUS.  Parking is horrible though, especially on weekdays. You need to come before 6pm to guarantee a parking spot in the plaza."}
{"text":"This is a pretty small restaurant ran by a family. I came here at noon with 10 people (adults and kids) and it wasn't busy at all (3 tables average). The service was prompt and food was average. This is a good place to come with several people since their portions are big. We shared 13 dishes and everyone was satisfied. It came to about $90 including tips and tax."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre: the siu long bao skin was too thick, they have only the dark brown vinegar for it (don't have the pink option), everything else we tried tastes average (steam bokchoy, garlic shrimp, corn egg soup.) The service was very slow, and they also don't have ice available for pop."}
{"text":"Great shanghainese food for a great price!  ENVIRONMENT - quite nice for a chinese place. Good for family style meals.  FOOD - My family of 4 got the $22 combo and one more noodle dish jand were left quite satisfied. The combo is meant for 2 people as per the menu, but depending on what you order, it can definitely leave 3-4 people full.  The $22 combo for 2 includes a 1) choice of soup (hot and sour soup and this other one which I cannot recall.. Sorry!). 2) 6 xiaolongbao or 5 fried dumplings or 5 ?????? (pan fried dumplings with soup inside). 3) 2 dishes from a list of preselcted dishes varying from shanghai noodles, fried rices, meat and veggie dishes.  The fried rices are huge for the price! So i recommend getting one if you want to feed more than 2. It had really good 'wok hei' and was quite good and had an abundance of chicken. The meat and veggie dishes are smaller but enough for 2-3 people.   The noodles we ordered in addition to the combo was the standard beef noodles soup. This was just okay... I've had better elsewhere, the broth IS hard to get right. But it still was decent. Hot and sour soup and dumplings were great, lived up to my expectations.   I'd come again! $30 leaving 4 people feeling pretty full and happy with the quality of the food is my kind of meal :)"}
{"text":"This place was ok, I'd give the Shanghai noodles 4 stars, but the other dishes weren't that great and the price was steep.  For 4 of us for lunch, it cost us $50. Usually for lunch at a chinese restaurant, 4 people can dine for $20-30. So I wouldn't say it was worth the cost, but wouldn't be opposed to coming here again if the prices dropped by 10-15%."}
{"text":"The Family Combo for Two ($20) at Golden Shanghai Restaurant is a good value.   For that price, one can pick a soup, a dim sum item and 2 dishes from a choice of 8.  We ended up sharing:  Hot and Sour Soup Steamed Pork Soup Dumpling Sweet and Sour Fish Spicy Minced Beer with Beans  The Hot and Sour Soup was pretty good, portion was large with a lot of ingredients. The skin of the soup dumplings though was really thick and doughy. The entree dishes were quite good.  Service definitely lacking as the restaurant was really understaffed.  I might be back to try out other food. But Golden Shanghai Restaurant is not my usual place to go for good Shanghainese food!"}
