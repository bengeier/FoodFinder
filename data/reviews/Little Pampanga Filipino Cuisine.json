{"text":"Place is very clean that's always a plus walking into a restaurant for the first time, the food is great def recommend"}
{"text":"The food is very delicious, and fresh. It's not greasy like most Filipino restaurants. The staff are very friendly!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Filipino restaurant the food is good, and the staff is really nice, and it's near my house which is even better :)"}
{"text":"Update!   I returned again for the kare kare, lechon and guinataan.  Once again, I am very impressed!  Please,  please, please support this resteraunt!  It's so awesome to finally have a filipino resteraunt,  this side of town. I will definitely be back again next week."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat around the area and I stumbled upon this place. I ordered the caldereta and lumpia. For the caldereta, their beef is meaty, just a couple that were mostly fat. The food was really good. The prices aren't bad either. I would say this is my favorite Filipino restaurant so far. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"My first time coming here...was very good. I had pancit, kare kare, adobo and turon. Only thing the pancit did not have much meat in it. There were only little bits of pork and Chinese sausage. Maybe it will be better next time. I'm pleased that there is a closer Filipino fast food place near me!"}
{"text":"Good place to get a quick bite to eat.  Recommend that you come early since the food stays on the line tends to dry out and is not of good quality.  They need more STAFF, more times that not it is very slow service."}
{"text":"Same owners and workers from Joshan's (Filipino market). Still a little under construction but definitely a go-to on my side of town, literally 5 mins away from home!   Menu board still isn't up yet, but some plate and a la carte prices are on a little sign stand on the top of the steam table.  Two to three entree plates where you get two scoops of rice and a choice of two entrees or three and any additional is an add on.  Been here twice already, first time the food didn't look so fresh but second time around was definitely better!  Choices from lechon kawali, thick veggie lumpia, BBQ pork, sinigang, torta (eggplant egg), dinuguan, kare kare, pancit, beef mechado, adobo, mongo, fish dishes and then some sweeter items like : ginataan, banana fritter and sweet karaoka(?) balls.  Very authentic to the taste. Tender meats, crispy-ness to the fried items, seasoned right, and a good portion given.  I'm sure they'll only improve from here.  Again, very excited of a Filipino restaurant being so close to home!"}
{"text":"This is small place connected to Joshan's filipino market next to Boulder Highway. Today's choices included goat kaldereta, kare kare, pancit, sweet and sour braised fish, munggo beans, sisig, loganisa, and grilled beef. A 1 choice plate is $4.99 and a 2 choice plate is $6.49. The food is good and they give you free sabaw (soup) with your meal. Will try their Halo Halo ($4.99) next time.."}
{"text":"I called today around 1:32pm, for Kare Kare, they said they had some. I live 2 minutes away, I go in, they said they didn't have any. The employee ask another employee, then that person asked another person, so they go in circles like they don't know anything. They just stand there oblivious to any sort of customer service.   Make it right, take care of the customers, if not then your business is pointless."}
{"text":"Went to this place at around 5 pm on a Saturday to dine in and coming from the west side of town this place is very far. They have few food selections. This restaurant is probably best suited for take out. The dining area did not have a good ambiance. This place is best suited for take out. We ended up leaving without buying anything. I can't rate the food which means my two stars is just for the place itself."}
{"text":"This is a smaller place with a grocery store next door.  The food is very good and the folks working there are friendly and helpful, even for this little white boy from SoCal. They made some good halo-halo too! We will come back again. salamat!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food to go... not a whole lot of space, but good enough. The map on yelp is wrong though. This place is between Russell and Boulder hwy."}
{"text":"Great authentic Filipino food. My husband is Filipino and he's been looking for a good restaurant. The food is fresh and tasty . Clean store with a good variety of products.  The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. The Beef kebabs were soooo yummy. That was my favorite."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot. The place is small but the food is good and they have a good variety. Next door is a grocery store and they are also well stocked and again they have a good variety of items. Their prices are decent and equally better than the bigger Filipino chain stores. I recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Very fresh, incredible flavor, generous portions, and excellent customer service. The kare-kare ox tail is super soft and my favorite. The pork is so good it melted in my mouth. The kaldereta is something I thought I would never eat again (cause I do like the taste of goat) but the beef as a replacement is just out of this world. I'm just 10mins away I'm definitely coming back to try more of your menu. Thank you for my first time experience coming here I hope you guys stay for a long time"}
{"text":"I love this cute Filipino restaurant. They are consistent with their food and it's not so pricey. I always order my pancit here for pot-lucks and my co-workers always begging for more. I think their best food menu options in on Saturday cause for sure you get kare-kare and bbq ready to go and their adobo is pretty bomb here."}
{"text":"I saw a while back that it looked like Joshan was extending. I had no idea that this was what they were doing. I thought they were just making their market larger because it was greatly needed. I believe they did but they also opened a take out and mini restaurant next to their market. Attached to Joshan you will find Phillipine cuisine available for takeout or you can dine in. About 5 or 6 tables available if you would like to eat on site. When we came in they had about 11 choices to choose from. Price range is $5-$8 so it's very affordable. If you choose pancit just remember that is one of your items it cannot be substituted for rice. Other please might substitute for you but not here. So I got two choices plus BBQ and my significant other got two choices with lechon and dinuguan. I did not like the rice it was very mushy. The chicken Tinola was very salty it had too much fish sauce. The lechon was good. Crispy and fresh. The BBQ sticks had good amount of meat. A lot of other places have a lot of fat to meat ration but the ration here was good. The sneeze guard was too high for the server because she couldn't see over it and kept bending down to look at us. Thought that was funny. This place is close to home so it's very convenient and there are not too many Filipino places to eat on this side of town so I think they'll do just fine. I will make sure to try something else next time and I will steer clear of the salty tinola"}
{"text":"This place overcharge me with the food and didn't give me my receipt after the transaction then after that didn't give me the drink I buy. Then when I came back to get my drink that she forgot she was trying to charge me again. What a rip off and incompetent staff. I know how to do math keep the 1.69$ drink you rip me off with. This was my first time and not coming back there again. So folks watch how much they charge you and don't forget your receipt !"}
{"text":"This is my go-to \"turo-turo\" Filipino restaurant. The menu rotates daily but they have some standard items that are always available, like pancit and lechon kawali.   Everything I've tried here has been delicious and so flavorful. Some of my favorites are the kare-kare, munggo, and pochero.   The must-order item here is the pork BBQ sticks. Every Filipino grows up eating pork BBQ sticks and I've tried many, many versions but this place has the best I've ever had. Seriously. But once they sell out, they're all out for the day. So get there early! Speaking of getting there early, I've gone in around 7pm a time or two and they've been nearly out of food and were no longer cooking anything else. Just keep that in mind before heading in later in the evenings. You can always call ahead and ask what they've got left, too."}
{"text":"Nice little place, brand new, located in the shopping center near Russell and Boulder Hwy. They have lots of filipino foods out in a buffet style setting.   Staff is very friendly and helpful. Its a small place with maybe two tables so take out is probably how you want to go. I went for some lumpia, and it was the larger Pampanga style which isn't my favorite. The BBQ pork sticks were tasty.  I'll try it again in the future."}
{"text":"20 capacity; very small and clean.. I really liked the sisig, paksiw, dinuguan, and kare kare..! I'll definitely come again next time I am on this side of town!"}
{"text":"My favorite stop by before I go to work.... because it's convenient for me. Only this the reason why I started to like Vegas!"}
