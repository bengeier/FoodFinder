{"text":"Such great food! Hand-made tortilla so you know it's like a home-cooked meal. Authentic Mexican food, made fresh every time. I have been coming here for the past 6 months and never had a difference in quality, always tasty. Down side is cash-only. Sopes are a must if you come!"}
{"text":"Great food in an odd, old strip mall. The food taste and quality were really good. The only reason that I am giving 4 stars is that they are \"Cash only\" and the spot is a little seedy. If you're open to trying something a bit different than your local taco shop, then give Nayar Sonora a try."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Its a hole in the wall but its very good! Must come here if you want great mexican food! Everything is made fresh and you can tell! Just make sure if you come you bring cash because it is a cash only place!"}
{"text":"Fresh food & tasty!! It's a small spot, kind of hidden but so worth it!! Tastes like home cooked food, so good!! The only little issue I can think of is they only take cash so make sure you have cash on hand. I work by this place so trust me, it's really good food. Great prices also!!"}
{"text":"I recently moved from L.A. To Vegas. I have been searching for a good burrito place. I FINALLY found one! Typically, these places have meat and rice without any flavor. This place, has flavor all around! I ate my burrito so fast I wished I had purchased a second one. Can't wait to tell my wife about it. Place could use a makeover but I didn't go there to judge appearances. I went to eat and eat I did. Fresh food made to order! I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD took a little long BUT it's because it was fresh. Tortilla by hand mmmmmm my ceviche was amazing but I didn't get aguacados maybe they forgot but the service was GREAT highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went here based on the reviews but I don't understand why this place received 5 stars, it was awful! 1st let me start by saying that we over paid for our meal because the girl at the counter couldn't understand what we were saying...this is where I wish I knew Spanish. I originally order a cheese enchilada and taco with rice and beans. I then saw the flautes and said, \" scratch that, I would like the flautas!\" My co-worker ordered a taco and enchilada. What we got was four plates of rice and bean, which we asked for two orders and a taco I didn't want. Each item had its own rice and beans, I explained to the lady she got are order wrong and we didn't want it but she was unforgiving and said she could put it in a to-go box. The flautas has no pico, sour cream or guacamole...which is what was stated in the picture, it came with lettuce, onion and cojita. I asked the lady for pico and guacamole and she came back saying she didn't have any. How can you be a taqueria with no tomatoes? I asked for avocado or guacamole, again, she comes back stating they don't have either.  The two things that were just OK were the rice and beans and the red salsa. Chips sucked, as did everything else!  Accept cash only!"}
{"text":"First time here.. lady recommended costillas de puerco chili Rojo came with beans and rice. Handmade tortillas were so delicious !
